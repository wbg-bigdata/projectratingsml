in the use of public resources.

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

Country background
Following the declaration of independence from the Soviet rule in 1991, the Republic of Georgia
undertook a series of structural reforms to move toward a new state model. These included
measures aimed at trade liberalization and legal and regulatory reform. The reforms also included
encouraging privatization and competition, banking sector restructuring, and judicial and health
sector reforms. However, weak fiscal management and lack of public sector capacity hindered
the effects of these reforms. Moreover, governance instability severely constrained broad-based
economic growth and poverty reduction, despite a rebound in the late 1990s.

The ‘rose revolution’ of 2003 gave a new impetus to the reform process. Large popular protests
during Parliamentary elections in November 2003 forced the resignation of the country’s
president and ushered in a reformist government. The newly elected government initiated
measures to reinvigorate economic performance. Results were positive: GDP growth at about 6.3
percent in 2004 and 8.2 percent in 2005; inflation at about 6.2 percent end December 2004,
averaging 8.3 percent throughout 2005. Tax/GDP ratio improved dramatically, up 3.5 percent in
2004 over the previous year. On the expenditure side, arrears from the previous administration
were cleared as a priority and minimum pensions were doubled from January 2005. Despite these
results, more than 50 percent of the population still lived in poverty with inadequate public
service delivery.

Sector background
The Government recognized the urgent need for a better functioning public sector to perpetuate
economic gains and meet growing social inequities. In 2004, the Ministry of Finance prepared the
Strategic Vision for Public Financial Management (PFM). This became the cornerstone for public
finance reform from 2004 onward. Objectives of this reform were: (i) maintain fiscal discipline;
(ii) support a strategic approach to the management of public finances; (iii) ensure that resources
are used efficiently and effectively; and (iv) ensure accountability. Parallel donor efforts
supported timely provision of information on transfer of resources in synchrony with the
Georgian budget cycle to improve predictability of budget resources. The Government took
strong ownership of the reforms but more efforts were needed to coordinate them across the
public sector. Critical path areas were procurement, payroll, internal auditing, and control systems.

The Economic Development Poverty Reduction Program (EDPRP) Annual Progress Report of
2004 similarly identified weakness in Georgia’s public sector management as the major
impediment to implementation of its ambitious state reform program. More accountable and
efficient public institutions and creation of a public service to meet medium-term economic and
social goals were viewed as priorities.

Rationale for Bank assistance
Bank assistance supported actions identified in the Government’s Strategic Vision for Public
Financial Management Reform. This included anticorruption measures in the National Anti-
Corruption Strategy, endorsed by the Government in June 2005. The Project was also consistent


                                                 1
with the Bank’s FY06-09 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). Improving efficiency in public
services was one of three overarching objectives to enhance Georgia’s prospects for poverty
reduction and attainment of MDGs

The Public Financial Management (PFM) reform agenda was incorporated into a coordinated
donor program. The program included: an ongoing World Bank PRSO (Poverty Reduction
Support Operation) program; the European Neighborhood Policy Initiative (ENPI); and
PSFMRSP. Strengthening public sector accountability, efficiency, and transparency was the first
pillar of the PRSO program, which directly linked it to the PSFMRSP.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The PDO focused on enhancing governance. This was to be achieved through: (i) strengthening
the institutional capacity of key agencies to more effectively and efficiently use public resources;
and (ii) improving accountability in the use of public resources.

Key Indicators. PRSO indicators were used as key indicators for the project. This was based on
the clear linkage between Pillar 1 of the PRSO and the PSFMRSP. The PAD included the
following eight key indicators:

  1. Clear national expenditure priorities identified and allocations to national priorities
     defended in the budget;

  2. Fiscal forecasts prepared for at least three years on a rolling annual basis, links between
     multi-year estimates and annual budget ceilings are clear and differences explained;

  3. All major public entities submit fiscal reports to central government at least annually, and
     central government consolidates overall fiscal risk issues into a report;

  4. Routine data collection or accounting systems provide reliable information on resources
     received in cash and in kind, and expenditures;

  5. Timely information is available about the size, composition, and cost to the civil service;

  6. Payroll and nominal roll data cover all of Government and are directly linked, with monthly
     reconciliation, updates, and reports on adjustments;

  7. Improved scope, nature, legislative scrutiny and follow-up on external audits, all central
     government entities are audited using (primarily) compliance audits which adhere to
     international auditing standards; and

  8. Provision of timely and transparent public financial management-related information to
     Parliament and civil society groups.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

PDO was not revised. The key indicators were revised in November 2006 based on guidance
from OPCS and ECSPS to provide a more focused results framework. The number of key
indicators was reduced from eight to six, new baselines were established and the indicators were




                                                 2
linked to PEFA indicators that became available by that time as an internationally recognized set
of indicators for measuring PFM performance. The list of revised key indicators follows below:

  1. National expenditure priorities fully defended in budget. MTEF increasingly based on full
     cost, results-based sector strategies consistent with fiscal forecasts (PEFA I-12 (iii))

  2. Ministry ceilings contained in Budget Guidelines w/multi-year function/sector estimates
     approved by Basic Data and Directions (BDD). Differences between actual estimates and
     approved BDD explained in annual budget presentation (PEFA I-12)

  3. Consolidated government financial statement published annually based on submission of
     fiscal reports from all major public entities (PEFA I-25)

  4. Measurable improvement in the HR management function of the Ministry of Finance

  5. External audit share of central government spending on which on-site audits are completed
     annually and disclosed to legislature within four months of the end of period covered
     (PEFA I-26)

  6. Timely, transparent and user-friendly provision of public financial information to the public
     (PEFA I-10)

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD and as
captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to benefit from
the project)

The direct beneficiaries were central government ministries responsible for public financial
management. These included the Ministry of Finance, especially the Treasury and Budget
functions, as well as the line ministries expected to be linked to the public financial management
information system. Another direct beneficiary was the Chamber of Control (State Audit Office).
The project was also expected to provide important benefits for a broader government and general
public through improving the timeliness and predictability of public expenditures, especially in
areas related to combating poverty, and increasing transparency in the use of public resources.
The availability of information on the use of public money to civil society was expected to
strengthen the link between governance and public accountability across the executive.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
There were four original components:

(1) MTEF and Budget Management, intended to address the need for a strategic medium term
budget planning cycle (estimated cost – US$2.27 million);

(2) Treasury Reform and Budget Execution, intended to develop a core Treasury information
system and set standards for line ministries regarding resource management planning and
processes. This was the biggest project component with an originally estimated cost of US$8
million. It included two subcomponents (sub-component 2a –support to Treasury, sub-component
2b – support to Budget Execution);

(3) Human Resources Management Information System, intended to create a civil service HRMIS
to address the lack of comprehensive data on size, composition, and remuneration of civil


                                                3
servants and to thereby address a part of the Government’s anti-corruption strategy (estimated
cost – US$2.14 million);

(4) Public Accountability and Oversight of Public Financial Management, intended to strengthen
the Chamber of Control’s operations and structure, and the development and implementation of
training program in external audit; as well as institutionalize budget process mechanisms from the
executive to foster public accountability (estimated cost – US$1.92 million).

In addition to the main four components, US$0.67 million was allocated to support project
management.

1.6 Revised Components

The scope of component 3 (HRMIS for the public service) was revised in the first year of project
implementation. The reorganization of the Public Service Bureau in 2006 made it impossible to
implement the component as designed. It was decided to retain the component but narrow the
scope of the HRMIS activity to focus on HR requirements in the MOF only.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding allocations)

The project underwent multiple changes, including reduction in scope and scale, extension of the
closing date, and partial cancellation of the funding.

After the mid-term review, the Project closing date was extended for two years to March 1, 2012.
The rationale for extension was to enable the implementation of the biggest project activity, the
public finance management information system (PFMIS), which was expected to include the core
treasury system and additional PFMIS modules supporting budget preparation and execution.

The MOF subsequently decided to cancel the ICB process for the implementation of PFMIS and
moved to develop the new information system with its own resources. It was agreed to redirect
part of the funds allocated for PFMIS development to other needs (in particular, for equipment for
the Finance Academy and the Procurement Agency).

As a consequence, the Project work plan and budget estimates were revised and decreased from
an initial US$15 million to US$11.78 million. Given the sizeable balance in the Single Treasury
Account as of September 2011, and the major part of the IDA contribution still undisbursed, the
Netherlands Embassy and SIDA decided to cancel their final disbursements of US$730K (of
US$2.1 million) and US$1.3 million (of US$4.5 million), respectively. In February 2012,
USD1.87 million of the IDA grant funds (of US$3 million) was also cancelled per the MoF
request, with the funds to be recommitted to another project under the Georgia portfolio.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

The Project was initiated to support the new government that had demonstrated strong political
will to undertake an ambitious governance reform strategy. The moment was seen as a window of



                                                4
opportunity for moving with long-awaited modernization changes in Georgia. In this context, the
timing of the donor response was of the essence. The Bank moved swiftly with designing the
package of interventions explicitly to support the government reform agenda.

For a project of such complexity, the preparation period was relatively short (nine months). It was
designed as part of a broader program supported by several donors. An important design feature
was the close link to the PRSO.

The Bank team followed the standard procedures for project preparation. Lessons learned from
previous operations in Georgia and more generally were reviewed. Alternatives were considered.
Numerous stakeholders were consulted during the preparation process.

IDA grant financing limits determined the need for partnership with other donors. The Bank
played an important role in mobilizing significant co-financing and providing the framework for
donor coordination. In the final design, the IDA grant accounted for only 20 percent of the total
project financing envelope. Significant attention was paid at the preparation stage to considering
alternative instruments to pooling donor funding. The pooling arrangement proposed was new for
Georgia. Based on experience with projects using a similar approach to pooled funding, the
necessary assessments were carried out and disbursement arrangements discussed in detail with
the counterparts. In line with the Government decision to channel all donor funds through the
national treasury system, it was decided to use country systems and disburse the project funds
through the treasury.

The PCN and Quality Enhancement Reviews both identified the scope of the project as ambitious
and suggested that the capacity of the government to implement the project as designed might be
inadequate. The particular aspects that made the scope ambitious and demanding for the
implementation capacity of the counterpart institutions were: (i) involvement of three
implementing agencies (MOF, Public Service Bureau, Chamber of Control), which were not in
subordinate relationship to each other; in addition, one of the implementing agencies did not
report to the Government (Chamber of Control); (ii) scope of activities under components 1 and 2
involved multiple inter-linkages between the activities and required parallel implementation of
several big activities in a relatively short period of time; (iii) inclusion of two large IT activities
under components 2 and 3 that involved development of highly complex information systems that
were expected to be inter-linked. It is noteworthy that the project was designed soon after the
Government decision to dismantle stand-alone PIUs and integrate project implementation
structures into implementing agencies. At the same time, the lead implementing agency for the
Project, the Ministry of Finance, lacked prior experience in implementing Bank-funded projects.

The final PAD recognized that project implementation capacity was identified as one of the key
determinants of success for all Bank-financed projects in the country and region. The main
instrument to mitigate associated risks was the project implementation arrangements that
envisaged the primary responsibility for project components would be assigned to the government
officials representing respective beneficiary agencies. These agencies were to receive support for
fiduciary functions by the staff of an experienced PIU recruited by the MOF as consultants. Funds
were also reserved for capacity-building activities under the project.

The risk assessment in the PAD was comprehensive and covered two groups of risks: (i) those
within the project and its immediate environment, and (ii) risks that fell outside the scope of the
project. The first category included: (i) uneven institutional capacity across Government could
hinder implementation; (ii) the current fragmented approach to civil service reform and the
ongoing, uncoordinated initiatives at individual agency level could be counterproductive and


                                                  5
create negative expectations about continued reforms; (iii) resistance to investing excessively in
external technical assistance; (iv) sustainability risk of capacity building efforts, as the civil
service was fluid and staff turnover common; (v) the substantial IT dimension of the Project in
the context of relatively local low implementation capacity in this technical area; and (vi)
obstacles to the smooth functioning of the pooled funding arrangements with other development
partners.

Risks outside the scope of the Project included: (i) an operating environment in which sometimes
haphazard political will and lack of incentives for decisive policy implementation provide
inadequate continuity of support or sustain public sector reforms; (ii) support could fade because
reforming the public sector was viewed as a demanding and long-term task with few immediate
tangible outputs; and (iii) territorial integrity-related problems could delay or undermine timely
decision-making that needed to take place to move the menu of reforms forward.

Mitigation measures were designed to address primarily internal risks, while it was also
acknowledged that mitigations of external risks were largely outside the donor control.


2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable) RESTRUCTURING and RISK, subsequent actions

The implementation progress during the first two years was slow and the project was classified as
“at risk? by the mid-term review. The IP rating was downgraded to MS in ISR#2, dated
November 2006, and further to MU in ISR#6 (May 2009), produced after the Mid-term Review
(MTR). The PDO rating was downgraded to MS only in ISR#5 (June 2008) and to MU in ISR#6.

The MTR that took place in January 2009 acknowledged some progress toward achieving the
PDO, but pointed to critical and persistent deficiencies in the implementation process, despite
concerns expressed by the Bank repeatedly during supervision missions (and recorded in the
respective Aide-Memoires (AMs)). These included a perceived lack of commitment and shift in
focus in the Strategic Vision for PFM Reform; a severe lag in procurement and IT system
development at the center of the PFMIS reform; weak arrangements for managing project
components (turnover and lack of capacity in PIU); and unsatisfactory project monitoring and
reporting. The MTR concluded with a very critical assessment of the project implementation
progress and formulated the recommendations for improvement that were fully accepted by the
Government.

On that basis, the Project closing date was extended for two years. It was recognized that by the
original closing date a significant number of outputs under components 1, 2 and 4 would have
been achieved. However, those pertaining to the Core Treasury System and additional PFMIS
modules supporting budget preparation and execution required more time to complete. The
implementation of project activities accelerated after the MTR and project management issues
were largely resolved.

However, in 2010, the MOF decided to cancel the ICB process for the implementation of an
integrated PFMIS solution and moved to develop the PFMIS system with its own resources. The
decision was made after the first stage of the ICB process and was preceded by lengthy internal
and external consultations. The Project work plan and budget estimates were subsequently
revised in coordination with the Bank and other developing partners, and decreased from an
initial US$15 million to US$11.78 million. Part of the funds allocated for PFMIS development


                                                 6
was redirected to other needs (in particular, for equipment for the Finance Academy and the
Procurement Agency). The majority of the project activities not directly dependent on PFMIS
were successfully completed by the new project closing date of March 2012.


Factors that affected implementation

Positive:

-   Continuity of the TTL on the Bank side throughout the design and implementation, as well as
    continuous presence of the TTL in the field were positive factors for the project. The Bank
    TTL played a very important role in building counterpart capacity for project management
    and assuring donor coordination.

Negative:

-   The first years of implementation were affected by the military conflict with Russia and the
    regional financial crisis. These extraordinary circumstances required a crisis management
    approach from the Government and the longer–term objectives of PFM reform became a
    lower priority.

-   Reorganization of the public service bureau made implementation of the original design of
    component 3 impossible.

-   The lead implementing agency (MOF) did not have prior experience in implementing Bank
    funded projects.

-   The complexity of the project design exacerbated capacity challenges. Multiple project
    activities were designed to occur in parallel, which led to capacity challenges that the
    government and its agencies did not manage to overcome. In addition, involvement of
    multiple implementing agencies determined the initial design of implementation
    arrangements that centered too much Project responsibility at the Ministry level. This caused
    lines of accountability at lower levels to become unclear.

-   The implementation of component 4 was also affected by multiple changes in the leadership
    of the implementing agency (Chamber of Control/State Audit Office).


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The M&E design was sound. PRSO benchmarks were used in the PSFMR as key indicators. This
linkage was expected to assure access to the required capacity to deliver PRSO commitments.
Attention was also paid to fine-tuning the indicators based on guidance from OPCS and ECSPS
to provide a more focused results framework. In this context, new baselines were established and
PDOs referenced to PEFA indicators. Key indicators were also supplemented by a comprehensive
matrix of intermediate results indicators. In combination, these provided a solid basis for
monitoring and evaluation of the project implementation progress. Monitoring was to take place
through quarterly performance reports prepared by Component Managers and submitted to PIT
and PMC; an annual report was also to be prepared within five months of end of the financial
year against the plan of work. The time-bound targets were to be closely monitored.




                                                7
However, the use of M&E was seriously compromised by protracted delays and lagging periodic
and annual reports by the Project implementation teams during the initial years. Delays in
submission of the Annual Work Program began in 2007. Even with close monitoring, delays
related to the integrated PFMIS compromised achieving benchmarks. By June 2007, it became
clear that the Project would not achieve its objectives by the original closing date. The PDO
rating was downgraded in June 2008 (ISR) and a major deficiency in project management and
implementation monitoring cited through May 2009. By June, project management had improved
but further improvements in monitoring and evaluation were still called for. After Project
extension, the AWP activities began to be monitored and evaluated more effectively, with most
activities on track by July 2010. Overall, there was an improvement in the M&E in the course of
implementation, but it remained insufficiently strong and underutilized through project closure.
This is evident from the quality of the annual progress reports and the final project completion
report.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

The financial management (FM) arrangements under the project, including accounting and
financial reporting, funds flow, and external audit, were acceptable to the Bank during Project
implementation. The FM arrangements were rated “highly satisfactory? at the beginning of
Project implementation, and “satisfactory? thereafter through Project close. The internal control
procedures also were adequate. The level of the government counterpart funding (GCF) overall
was adequate; however, it remained below the agreed annual level until the end of the project,
when it reached the agreed percentage (6%) of total project cost.

Planning and budgeting arrangements were adequate and acceptable to the Bank. However,
Annual Work Plans (AWP), which should had been approved no later than May 1 of each year
(as per the Project Operational Manual), were usually approved with delays by the Project
Management Committee (PMC). All payments were made through the Treasury Service and
closely monitored (Bank practice in Georgia since 2006). The quarterly IUFRs were generally
received on time and acceptable to the Bank, as were the audited project financial statements with
the auditor’s unmodified (clean) opinion. Delays occurred in the submission of audited financial
statements for FY 2006, FY2007, and FY2010 (slight delay). The reason was mainly the donors’
preference for a five-month submission period instead of the Bank’s six months for projects in
Georgia.

There were no major procurement violations in the course of project implementation. However,
IT procurement confronted a number of typical issues for large-scale projects, the most important
being lack of a general concept or strategy for IT implementation that took into account the long-
term nature of the investment for the country. Among the specific issues were: (i) Not all bid
submissions were technically sound. Technical specifications in both large and small ICB
procurements revealed instances of specifications copied directly from specific manufacturers;
(ii) technical requirements/specifications were prepared by the purchaser with specific
solutions/equipment or vendors in mind, including requests for specific brands and Direct
Contracting; and (iii) bids evaluation was not fully documented for technical compliance,
requiring additional clarification.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

While no follow-up operation is anticipated, there continues to be ongoing in-house development
of the PFMIS to complete the system requirements initiated under the Project. The preliminary
results of in-house development are promising; however, the recommendations of the
independent assessment that preceded the MOF decision to cancel the ICB tender for PFMIS
were not fully implemented. This raises concerns about the feasibility of achieving a reliable
quality of PFMIS based on in-house development.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)
Project objectives and achievements remain highly relevant to current country priorities. The
project is also consistent with the current CPS for Georgia (FY10-13), which continues to support
good governance, resting on the two main strategic pillars: (i) meeting the post-conflict and
vulnerability needs, and (ii) restoring growth and competitiveness. The outcome identified under
the first strategic objective—improved public resource management-–is linked directly to the
PSFMRS project objective and outcomes.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)

The Project provided an important contribution to strengthening the institutional capacity of the
key agencies to more effectively and efficiently use public resources and improving
accountability in the use of public resources; however, it could not fully achieve the PDO.
As reflected in the analysis of results section of the data sheet and the table below, the project
contributed to significant improvement in several dimensions of PFM performance, including
stronger multi-year perspective in fiscal planning and budgeting; improved predictability in the
availability of funds for commitment of expenditures; improved public access to key fiscal
information; and improvement in the scope, nature, and follow up of external audit. Five out of
six key indicators were achieved.
Regrettably, the biggest project activity related to development of the public finance management
information system could not be implemented as planned. This did not allow achievement of the
respective intermediate results1 and limited the project outcomes.

                                                        from B in 2008 to A in 2012.

Causal Linkages between outputs and outcomes (please see Annex 2 for more details).

The objectives of the MTEF and Budget Management Component (1) were achieved
(Satisfactory) based on completion of most of the activities/outputs. The MTEF has been fully
integrated and institutionalized within the budget planning process, and planning now occurs
within a more accurate macro-fiscal framework. The budget process has also become more
transparent and open to public scrutiny.

To enable the achievement of these results, the Project supported the development of the new
Budget Code that institutionalized the MTEF process and established the equalization transfer
formula to regulate the relationship between the central and local budgets. Important support was
provided for introducing program-based budgeting. Program budget guidelines with unified
terminology were developed and finalized in consultation with line ministries. The 2012 State
Budget was prepared using the new program-based budget structure.

Through capacity building provided by the Project, the MOF strengthened its strategy and annual
budget planning processes and improved arrangements for monitoring and oversight of budget
implementation. Additionally, capacity and procedures for strategic expenditure planning, budget
preparation, and budget management were strengthened in line ministries. Improved processes for
financing the budgets of territorial units were also put in place. An internal budget policy and
public expenditure review process was introduced and capacity-building and training strategy for
staff in MOF Budget Department and line ministry budget units developed and implemented
through the Finance Academy.

The objectives of the Treasury Reform and Budget Execution Component (2) could only be
partially achieved (Moderately Satisfactory). Based on the analysis undertaken, it was decided
to revise the timeframe of implementation of the national accounting standards aligned with
IPSAS. The respective key indicator and intermediate indicators therefore could not be achieved.
The Ministry of Finance oversaw preparation of IPSAS training methodology and rollout of
training based on standards for all central government spending units, including training of
trainers. The accounting methodology and analysis department was established in the Treasury to
lead the accounting reform process, including defining accounting standards and regulations.
Temporary regulation on financial reporting aligned with modified cash based IPSAS was piloted
in 2011.

Resource management processes (including cash and procurement management) and budget
accounting and reporting products were improved in line ministries, PLEs and other general


                                                 11
government entities. Cash management procedures were also improved in the Treasury and
spending agencies based on longer horizons for cash plans and more reliable access to financial
resources. The project contributed to these improvements mainly through training opportunities
provided to the Treasury staff.

Following an independent assessment of the Ministry’s current applications software solution,
which support the financial management practices, and the available IT capacity, the Ministry
cancelled the ICB process and instead decided to develop it on its own. A significant part of the
system functionality has already been developed in-house, including web-based solutions for
submission of payment requests by the spending units (e-treasury) and submission of budget
requests by the line ministries (e-budget). The treasury payment system was integrated with the e-
procurement system and electronic exchange of data was established with the revenue service, the
National Bank, as well as with the civil service and public entity registers.

Progress with automation of the treasury functions resulted in improved efficiency of its services,
with the treasury operations now taking only a few minutes to execute. The switch to electronic
exchange of information also allowed a radical reorganization of the treasury service and closing
all 11 regional treasury offices. Effectiveness of public resource allocation decisions improved
significantly because of availability of real-time data on cash balances and spending position.

Although initial results of in-house development of the new information system are encouraging,
it is too early to assess the overall quality of the development, as a critically important part of the
core treasury system is still being designed, including the general ledger. Also, some essential
methodology issues still remain unresolved (for example, the method of integration of the budget
classification with the chart of accounts).

Project funds not used for PFMIS were partially reallocated to support capacity building of the
Financial Analytical Service (FAS) staff as well as make selected investments in ICT
infrastructure. The FAS was established in mid-2010 to support existing and new information
systems and strengthen information and communications technology used by the Ministry of
Finance.

The original objectives of the Human Resources Management Information System
Component (3) could not be fully achieved, which became apparent with the reorganization of
the Public Service Bureau in 2006, thus closing the possibility of developing a government wide
HRMIS, as planned. The HRFMIS scope was reduced and focused on the internal needs of the
MOF only. The results achieved under the revised scope of this component are satisfactory and
include: (i) the development of a database including all MOF personnel; (ii) a payroll system
operated centrally by the Treasury system, with monthly salary payments made directly to
individual banks; (iii) development of an HRMIS module for the MOF; and (iv) the establishment
of the training academy of the MOF. Part of the funds not used for development of information
systems were re-directed to purchase equipment for the training academy.

The objectives of the Public Accountability and Oversight of PFM Component (4) were
achieved (Satisfactory). The Chamber of Control was legislatively transformed into the Supreme
Audit Office. The human resources capacity of the Supreme Audit Office was significantly
improved by an intensive training program and selection of staff based on merit criteria to meet
the needs of the organization and to implement an audit methodology consistent with
international best practice. The project supported training for SAO staff, some of whom were
trained at the Finance Academy, to improve staff performance in applying the new Financial
Audit Manual. The training program led to the certification of auditors successfully completing


                                                  12
the course. ITC equipment was purchased to complement the ICT infrastructure and software
development needs assessment carried out with assistance from the Swedish National Audit
Office. Greater transparency was achieved through frequent stakeholder consultations and public
announcements of the SAO findings.

Taking into account that the biggest project activity was not fully implemented, and the related
key and intermediate indicators could not be fully achieved, the overall rating is Moderately
Satisfactory

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
N/A

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

Institutional change and strengthening achieved under the project were significant. In particular,
reorganization of the treasury function through centralizing and automating the operations, and
transformation of the treasury into a service provider represent significant achievements and put
the treasury of Georgia among the leaders of treasury reforms in the ECA region. Similarly,
progress achieved in transformation of the Chamber of Control into a Supreme Audit Office is
very impressive. The Supreme Audit Office received capacity development assistance that
enabled it to restructure and undertake a staff rationalization program and subsequent training
specifically designed to improve the effectiveness of its function. In addition, a Finance Academy
was established (on a quasi-proprietary basis) to provide capacity building for MOF, its affiliates,
and the public sector in accounting and auditing in particular. The institutionalization of the
training mechanism is especially important for ensuring sustainability of the project results.
Development of the MOF internal IT capacity through establishment of FAS is also an important
institutional change to which the project contributed.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The project resulted in significant institution-building impact and this created a solid basis for
sustainability of its results.

However, the MOF has opted for a risky solution by deciding to develop the PFMIS in-house.
Although the initial results of in-house development are promising, the recommendations of the
independent assessment that preceded the MOF decision to cancel the ICB tender were not fully
implemented. In particular, the assessment noted that “a system with the level of integration and
engineering quality required from PFMIS is unlikely to result from piecemeal building of its parts
without guiding data, process and technology architectures.? To assure the quality of the system,
the assessment recommended bringing in high-quality international expertise to develop data,
process, and technology architectures. There was no immediate follow up to the recommendation
from the MOF side, and with the project closure it lost access to the donor resources to finance
such expertise. There is therefore a significant risk that the quality of the PFMIS system being
developed in-house could be below the expected standard, and that the desirable degree of system
integration would not be achieved.

Another important risk is the loss of capacity developed because of personnel changes (quite
probable now in light of the recent political developments). In the case of the State Audit Office,
this risk is exacerbated by the planned move of the main office of the institution to another city.

The latter risk was partially mitigated by establishment, with project support, of an
institutionalized training mechanism through the Finance Academy, and the State Audit Office
training center. Also, the ongoing twinning arrangement between the SAO and the Swedish
National Audit Office provides hope for continuity and sustainability of results achieved under
component 4. There are several examples of positive results of recent bilateral assistance
provided by SNAO to the counterpart institutions in the ECA region (e.g., Croatia, Moldova).

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: MU

The rating for Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is Moderately Unsatisfactory, taking
into account that capacity constrains flagged by the PCN and QER meetings were not fully
addressed in the final design and became an issue within the first project year. The complex and
ambitious design did not match the existing capacity on the counterpart side and was one of the
reasons for unsatisfactory implementation progress during the first years of implementation.

Both the PCN and QER reviews noted the risk assessment was unrealistic in light of the complex
and ambitious nature of the operation. In particular, the QER Panel called for much more
elaboration of PFMIS procurement strategy up front to mitigate substantial IT implementation
risks, which later materialized. The panel also noted the limited implementation capacity of the
government and the importance of incorporating specific benchmarks against which component



                                                 14
progress could be measured. Sequencing was also singled out for comment regarding components
1 and 2 as well as HRMIS-related interventions to ensure they properly reflected the actual
capacity on the ground, and recommended tempering expectations, especially concerning the
PFM and civil service components. In particular, the design of the Project called for
implementation of numerous activities in parallel without sufficient regard for the capacity
challenges inherent in simultaneous implementation or the need for sequencing. This quickly
became an issue during the first years of implementation and resulted in significant delays. The
need for strong coordination across Project components was also not adequately taken into
account in the design. The risks with project management were assessed but risk mitigation
measures proved to be inadequate.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: MS

A Moderately Satisfactory rating is assigned for the quality of supervision.

Problems with capacity of the project implementation entities and the Project management
structure emerged at the beginning of implementation and continued through the mid-term review.
The Bank continually attempted to draw counterpart attention to these issues during the
supervision missions, as recorded in the aide-memoirs. However, the IP rating in the ISR was
downgraded to MU only after the MTR. The persistence of the observed implementation
deficiencies might have justified a much earlier downgrading.

The MTR was used efficiently by the team to draw Government attention to the fact that project
implementation fell well below expectations. Following the mid-term review, the Government
acted to strengthen the capacity of the Administrative and Procurement Support Team (APST),
and coordination by the MOF improved significantly.

The situation with the ICB tender required flexibility and openness from the Bank team to
consider alternatives to proven approaches to developing PFMIS. The in-house development
preferred in the end by the Government is a solution the quality of which is hard to assure. Given
that the tender for the biggest project activity was also the main reason for the project extension,
and in the face of cancellation, the rationale for further involvement of donors in the project
became problematic. The TTL deserves credit for managing effectively the dialogue both
internally and externally in a very difficult situation. The external assessment of the counterpart
IT capacity proposed by the Bank was a constructive solution to facilitate resolution of a critical
project situation and avoid further disruptions to implementation. Regrettably, the
recommendations of the independent assessment could not be implemented within the project
timeframe, which left unaddressed the risks related to the quality of the PFMIS system now being
developed in-house.

Fiduciary supervision was adequate throughout the project implementation period.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: MS

Based on the evaluation of the Bank performance during the lending phase and supervision, the
overall Bank performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: MS (Moderately Satisfactory)

In the critical initial stages of Project implementation, the Government waivered in its
commitment to the agreed Project objectives as well as to its own Strategic Vision, which had
provided the blueprint and rationale for the Project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: MU

Protracted delays during the first years of implementation, and the lack of action from the MOF
on the Bank observations about critical deficiencies in the implementation process made during
the supervision missions and reflected in the Aide-Memoires, are the main reasons behind the
Moderately Unsatisfactory rating.

Following the mid-term review, the Bank insisted that the Government remedy the project
management and M&E issues before the Project could be extended. Implementing agency
performance improved after the extension, and the PMC and APST teams were able to provide an
Annual Work Plan and monitoring and evaluation updates on a more routine basis. However,
M&E remained insufficient and continued to be underutilized.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: MS

Based on the evaluation of the Government performance and the implementing agency
performance, the overall Borrower performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

Government ownership of the reform agenda is essential to ensure effective implementation
and future sustainability of the Project. Priority interventions were identified for the Project
after extensive consultations with counterparts as well as main stakeholders within the framework
of the Government’s Strategic Vision and National Anti-corruption Strategy. A key condition for
Board presentation was the endorsement by decree of the Minister of Finance of the reform
direction proposed in the Strategic Vision document, and the specific reform dimensions in the
Government Accounting Strategy. Yet the Government did not follow through on the strategic
vision after effectiveness. In Georgia, with a modernizing but relatively inexperienced
government, the possibility of dramatic changes in government agencies, such as the
reorganization of the Public Service Bureau, in the first year of the Project, essentially
eliminating one component of the project, may be more common than in other countries in or
outside the Region. The lesson is that agreements with the Government may subject to unexpected
changes given its rapidly evolving and dynamic reform agenda. This suggests that Bank lending
approaches may need to be highly adaptable but more tightly focused, especially on institutional
development, instead of comprehensive and heavily oriented to ITC. It also suggests that the
Government generally takes a more pragmatic than programmatic approach to development
solutions, which should be taken into account in subsequent operations.

Project implementation capacity is a key determinant of success for all Bank-financed
projects in the country and region and needs to be carefully assessed during project
implementation. The project was the first experience of the Ministry of Finance in dealing with
the Bank procedures. It was also designed soon after the Government decision to move towards
integrating project implementation structures into Government entities and dismantling the stand-
alone PIUs. These circumstances were compounded by a very complicated and broad project
design that did not match the beneficiary capacity. If the capacity of the Government and its
implementing agency is not strong, and the project is identified as complex, it is inadvisable to
move forward until such time as the requisite capacity is in place or the project is simplified to
reflect the counterpart’s actual capacity to manage implementation dynamics to ensure expected
project outcomes can be achieved and safeguarded.

Decisions on the type of IT solution to be used are critically important for the
projects that involve significant investments in complex information systems. This
project is one of several cases in the ECA region where governments were hesitant about
procuring an off-the-shelf software solution for PFMIS. The MOF of Georgia was interested in
having an assessment of possible alternatives at an early stage of the project, but was not fully
satisfied with the quality of the consultant analysis it received. This later led to re-opening the
issue during the ICB tender and eventually led to the tender cancellation. The Bank might
consider investing in development of recommendations for its clients on how to approach their
respective decisions in a more systematic manner. The methodology used for the 2010
independent assessment of the existing systems and IT capacity in Georgia could be useful in this
context. The assessment of this nature would be most beneficial during the project preparation
stage. It also might be advisable to recruit reputable companies for implementation of such
assessments, to mitigate the risk associated with reliance on individual consultant opinions.

Innovative funding mechanisms, such as “pooled funding? used in this Project, need to be
carefully evaluated with respect to suitability if there is probability of weak implementation
capacity. The pooled account was expected to provide flexibility to the client. It was also
designed to accommodate the partner donor requirements for visibility of their contributions to
the project. However, there were challenges in accounting contributions from multiple donors in
various currencies and meeting the donor reporting requirements. The pooled account also limited
flexibility of donors in adjusting the disbursement patterns to the changing circumstances. In
particular, when the project had to be extended, adjustments in disbursement targets and end dates
were not easy to implement, (i.e., some donors had to freeze their funding until others expedite
disbursements to meet their internal requirements and limitations). In the end, the arrangement
did not assure equal treatment of the donors with respect to the funding shares that were to be
cancelled. IDA had to cancel the biggest share of its grant, compared to the shares of funding
undisbursed by other donors. It is therefore not obvious that the pooled funding arrangement
used under the project was optimal under the circumstances. The unintended effects of the
funding arrangement used for this project should be analyzed carefully to avoid similar situations
in other projects.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The Borrower noted in its ICR disagreements with the Bank team on the approach to developing
PFMIS solution. In particular, it is mentioned that the MOF questioned from the very beginning
the relevance of commercial software for the Georgia context and that it took long time to
convince the donors to change the methodology defined in the original project appraisal


                                                17
document. In the MOF view, if they could have started in-house development of PFMIS earlier,
the project resources would have been used more efficiently. Donors are requested to be more
flexible when the recipient government approaches them with requests to change work direction
if the outcome is expected to be the same. The FAS has also disagreed with the ICR team
assessment of the risks associated with ongoing approach to development of PFMIS in-house.

 The ICR team views on these issues are reflected in section 4 (Assessment of risks to
development outcomes), section 5.1b) (Bank performance in assuring the quality of supervision),
and section 6 (Lessons learnt). In particular, it is acknowledged that the situation with the ICB
tender required flexibility and openness from the Bank team to consider alternatives to proven
approaches to developing PFMIS. All the available analysis of experiences with implementation
of similar systems indicates that in-house development preferred in the end by the Government is
a solution the quality of which is hard to assure. The external assessment of the counterpart IT
capacity proposed by the Bank was a constructive solution to facilitate resolution of a critical
project situation and avoid further disruptions to implementation. Regrettably, the
recommendations of the independent assessment could not be implemented within the project
timeframe, which left unaddressed the risks related to the quality of the PFMIS system now being
developed in-house

The main lesson learnt is that decisions on the type of IT solution to be used are critically
important for the projects that involve significant investments in complex information systems.
The Bank might consider investing in development of recommendations for its clients on how to
approach their respective decisions in a more systematic manner. The methodology used for the
2010 independent assessment of the existing systems and IT capacity in Georgia could be useful
in this context. The assessment of this nature would be most beneficial during the project
preparation stage. It also might be advisable to recruit reputable companies for implementation of
such assessments, to mitigate the risk associated with reliance on individual consultant opinions.

                        (including assumptions in the analysis)


The Project supported public sector financial management reforms and related capacity
building, so standard computations of economic rates of return are not applicable.

Technical assistance and investments envisaged under the Project aimed at improving
performance of key government institutions at the central level in implementing specific
budget management, execution, accounting, auditing as well as human resources
management tasks. Therefore, return of investments under the Project was expected to be,
to a large extent, in a form of better performing public institutions capable of employing
financial and human resources in an effective, transparent and accountable way.

The major benefits of the Project are difficult to quantify and measure. These include
providing the means to ensure effective implementation of budget allocations and greater
transparency in government’s financial management as well as in strengthening
instruments of fiscal control. Implementing the new treasury system and streamlining
budget preparation and implementation procedures resulted in efficiencies in government
budgetary transactions. Better cash management reduced idle balances in government
accounts. More efficient execution of budgetary transactions reduced delays in payments
and should have eventually reduced the cost of goods and services to the government.

      a. Comments on draft ICR4
           

      We reviewed the report on PSFMRSP implementation results. On behalf of all beneficiaries
      of the project we would like to note, that we don't have any major concerns and in general,
      the report is acceptable.

      FAS provided comments regarding the risks identified in section 2.5 - Post-completion
      Operation/Next Phase and section 4 - Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome (the
      respective text is colored in red in the attached file). Financial Analytical Service does not
      agree with that statement and asserts that data processing procedures and system technology
      architecture is robust enough to achieve the desired integrated in-house system. The comment
      is given below:

      "MOF technical staff developed the technology architecture fully in accordance with data and
      process model provided by the State Treasury, implementing the best practices widely
      accepted for the complex financial transaction systems worldwide. Not going into the deep
      technical details, key characteristics of the system in development are:

      § - Distributed, modular structure of all software components, allowing them to function
      independently in case of other systems failure;

      § - N-Tier systems architecture, implying moving business logic totally out of database and user
      interface layers and developing separate system core incorporating business logic there, thus
      implementing stable and flexible architecture.

      § - Web services (XML based) standard integration model across all systems, providing uniform
      method for integration of existing systems and for future ones.

      § - - Modern technologies for development environment: MS SQL Server 2008 R2, Microsoft .NET
      framework 4 and Microsoft Entity Framework, using C# for development language and compiling
      each layer as a separate assembly block. Communications Layer utilizes Microsoft Windows
      Communications Foundation, compatible with almost any client technology, based on open standards.

      - Virtualized environment for deployment, providing high availability and flexible hardware resource
      allocation. Business continuity is provided by the disaster recovery center with full capacity hardware
      and configuration, mirroring the main site.

      § - - Microsoft Operational Framework, ITIL standards and project management methodology was
      used in the process of development, together with source and code development control implemented
      through Team Foundation Server.

      The aspect of developing system has to be taken into account, meaning that the systems is
      still under development and certain, though relatively small percentage of features and
      improvements will be added during the next couple of years. However, core functionality is

   already available and stably functioning. The strategy of systems architecture is providing
   reliable basis for integration of any system, planned according to the standards defined.
   MOF has decided to advance towards in-house development of PFMS project taking into
   account a large number of argument on both pro and con sides. One of the key influence
   factors for such decision was MOF technical staff confidence into its technical capabilities
   that was confirmed by the independent audit conducted by the World Bank. Technical
   assistance from the side of international experts in software architecture was asked for
   additional increase of capabilities of IT application development team, but it should not be
   considered as a significant factor affecting quality of the system in development."



   b. Summary of Borrower’s ICR

Component 1 Observations:

MOF acknowledges PFMRSP valuable assistance in the reforms in the sphere of
Budgeting especially in capacity building:
    The project allowed to have a wider access to the best practices of other countries
      which have gone through the same stages of reforms by providing the necessary
      material and consultations related to MTEF, Budget Classification Standards,
      Program Budgeting etc;
    The project assisted in sharing the experience of other countries by organizing
      study-visits, supporting participation of Georgian side in different conferences,
      seminars and working-groups;
    Project supported capacity building of the respective staff within the MOF and
      other Spending Units (e.g. New Budget Classification Implementation, Program
      Budgeting, English Language Courses,)
    Project supported equipping the MOF Academy, which is gradually becoming a
      center for the capacity building of the current and future staff of the organizations
      related Public Finance.

The project implementation process should be assessed positively in overall. Though the
main points of activities under the project needed time before reaching the right
solution the project support to the reform was significant.

MTEF – Introducing MTEF was not one of the easiest tasks and it took years before the
Basic Data and Directions Document (BDD) obtained its current format and content. Of
course the document will be further improved but to reach the current point certain
experience was needed. Consultants, material and recommendations under project were
of great help through this difficult task. As a result of the experience which was gained
with time and years of preparing the document and with help of the Project support
MTEF has become functional




                                               33
Program Budgeting – Introducing Program Budgeting was a real challenge. Timeframe
for its implementation was quite tightening and a lot of aspects had to be decided and
agreed upon while piloting it. The project was helpful in sharing the experience of other
countries and giving recommendations of the best ways.

Public Finance Management and especially MTEF and Budgeting is the sphere which is
under constant reforming, it always needs to be updated and best fit to available resources
and expenditure priorities. Thus reforms in this field will be continued in the future as
well and any support which will be based on real needs will be welcomed.

Component 2 Observations:
Overall evaluation of the project implementation results is positive but we observed
several issues during the project implementation that was not adequately considered and
assessed during the original appraisal of the project goals and objectives.

IPSAS implementation – Since the PSFMRSP provided an excellent opportunity to fund
the expensive technical assistance and other project related costs, we attempted to design
the tight implementation schedule. This was very risky decision because international
practice proves that similar projects take decades to implement. The lengthy procurement
procedures and deficit of qualified accountants were regarded also as one of the obstacles
during the project implementation. Internal capacity was an issue as well. At the very
starting point of reforms people are not aware of the scopes and details, therefore
identifying the real needs, drafting the right TORs, selecting the best suitable candidate
would take weeks and months. WB experts were a huge helping hand in this. They
provided useful feedbacks and comments during the preparation of ToRs and evaluation
of proposals. Regardless of these problems we are on track and have substantially
advanced with the IPSAS implementation project, however some important activities
could not be completed, such as training of BOs staff, design the methodology of
defining norms for assets depreciation, etc.

PFMS implementation – This is extremely both - time and resource consuming project
as well worldwide. Besides, rapid development of information and communication
technologies and systems in general make it difficult to identify the right solution for the
specific assignment. We’ve lost several years while trying to identify implementation
methodology. At the very starting point we questioned the relevance of commercial
software for our context, after the demonstration of proposed systems our skepticism
even increased, but it took couple of years to convince the donors to change the
methodology defined in the original project appraisal document. Should have the MoF
started in-house development of PFMS earlier, the project resources would have been
used more efficiently. Surely.
Donors need to be more flexible when the recipient government approaches them with
the request to change work direction if the outcome is expected to be the same.

Overall result in this field is also notable: FAS infrastructure is the best available as of
today. Capacity of Technical and functional staff increased, assessment of systems done.




                                             34
This assessment is very positive and promising and we are confidently heading to the
goal.

Component 3:   Due to the reorganization of the Public Service Bureau (PSB) in 2006,
there is no possibility to develop a government wide HRMIS system for the public sector
within the scope of the project now. Instead, the MOF decided to develop a HR
management module (as a simplified version of the HRMIS) to cover their requirements
and add a payroll calculation module as a part of future PFMS, to create an interim
solution. Therefore, PFMS scope was reduced and ICT related Component 3 activities
were merged in Component 2. Later MOF HR Department was reorganized and the
Component 3 activities brought to an end.

Component 4: Public Accountability and Oversight of PFM. The objectives of
this component were to: (i) facilitate the strengthening of the State Audit Office of
Georgia’s (formerly Chamber of Control of Georgia) operations and structure and the
development and implementation of training program on external audit; and (ii) help with
institutionalizing budget process mechanisms within and from the executive that will
enable public accountability.

       The State Audit Office of Georgia has been involved in fruitful cooperation with
the Public Sector Financial Management Reform Support Project. Through the last 6
years of project term the external audit role, mandate and function have significantly
improved thanks support of the project and other partners. The Project set specific goals
and objectives to be achieved through comprehensive reform activities within the Public
Finance Management System of Georgia. The external audit component included all the
necessary areas to be improved to build capacity of the State Audit Office. In particular
improved scope, nature, legislative scrutiny and follow up on external audits were set as
overarching goals of the project. The audit activities in accordance with international
auditing standards are central element of the strategic objectives.

         During the year of 2011 the State Audit Office of Georgia implemented core
portion of its Strategic Goals set in Plan for 2010-2012. The Year 2011 should be
distinguished for introduction of risk based modern audit methodologies. The results of
institutional reforms have significantly increased the efficiency of the work to be
performed by institution, the auditors and experts with impartially measurable financial
and non-financial impacts. All the aforementioned promote improvement of management
of public finances as the results of the issued recommendations and more efficient
delivery of public service. The sustainable institutional development process covered
wide range of the aspects of the functioning of the SAO: Mandate, Governance, Audit
quality, Human Recourses, Information Technologies, Communication etc. Below are
described all the important strategic steps taken by the SAO.

State Procurement Agency Institutional Support
The Objective of this sub component was to make the procurement related information
sharing more effective. To ensure the Georgian State Procurement e-System full and


                                           35
efficient functioning IT infrastructure has been established under PSFMRSP. As a result,
the Georgian Electronic Government Procurement (GeGP) is linked to the Treasury’s
information system, enabling sharing all procurement related information, inter alia
information regarding contracts and phases of their fulfillment. GeGP is also linked to the
Public Registry (NAPR) of firms, which assists at recognition of the entity while
registering and to the Civil Registry Agency to facilitate registration process of physical
entities, also to establish e-signature tool. GeGp linking to the State Audit Office is also
planned, that aims at effective and systematical control of public expenditure.

          Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders


Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency 5:

Sida’s overall results assessment of Public Sector Financial Management Reform Support Project
is considered satisfactory. Sida mainly agrees with all findings presented in the ICR report and
will highlight some of weak areas of the project that could be additionally emphasized.

Government of Georgia was not considering the public finance reform as one of the most
important priorities during the Country’s democratic development process. The implementation
of the PSFMRSP was delayed due to internal and external risks. The mitigation measures were
not adequately taken by the Project Implementation Team. The Project Implementation Team had
no Project Manager who could lead the project’s timely implementation and coordination among
GOG and between implementing entities of the PSFMRSP. Accordingly, the disbursement of
Sida funds has been lower then decided in the Sida Decisions on Contribution. Cancelling the
ICB process and PFMIS systems in house development was one of the main reason withdrawing
Sida funds (1.3 Million USD out of total 4.5 Million USD).

According to Sida assessment PSFMRSP has built the capacity of Ministry of Finance, Finance
Academy, Chamber of Control (State Audit Office), Procurement Agency and improved the key
Governmental entities performance. The overall public finance system of Georgia became more
transparent and accountable to public.

The embassy of Netherlands responded that they had no comments on the draft ICR.

DFID program for Georgia has been closed and no representatives with institutional
memory of the project were identified.
