                     The World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) and
                     the CPS Progress Report were presented to the Board in March
                     2008 (Report No. 42846-MX) and February 2010 (Report No.
                     52776-MX), respectively. The proposed Development Policy Loan
                     (DPL) is in line with the CPS Progress Report, which envisioned
                     an active program of financial services during fiscal year 2012 in
                     response to the Government of Mexico’s request. Fiscal risk
                     mitigation is a key theme of the Government’s program and the
                     CPS while the World Bank has conducted extensive analytical
                     work to assist the policy dialogue in this area. Moreover, the
                     proposed operation is part of a larger programmatic engagement in
                     fiscal risk management - which includes knowledge services,
                     convening services, development policy lending and, investment
                     lending.

                     A sharp weakening in the economic recovery of the United States
                     would pose downside risks to Mexico’s growth due to the high
                     degree of integration, and could affect some program progress.
                     Likewise, sovereign debt and banking sector problems in Europe
                     could increase global risk aversion, and lead to higher volatility in
                     Mexico’s financial markets. However, Mexico’s strong fiscal and
                     monetary policy frameworks and track record reinforce
                     macroeconomic stability and enhance the economy’s resilience to
                     external shocks. Mexico’s public debt structure and international
                     reserve accumulation limit the impact of heightened global risk
                     aversion, though the increased foreign investor participation in
                     domestic bond markets warrants close monitoring of international
                     capital flows. This DPL further strengthens the Government’s
    Risks and Risk   ability to address fiscal risks in general, but in particular attempts
    Mitigation       to mitigate the impact of short term fiscal risks on the budget.
                     Limited control over the legislative agenda and the upcoming
                     presidential elections –July 2012– may lead to slower progress on
                     the advancement of structural reforms. The Government has begun
                     to rely on actions that do not require legislative approval, such as a
                     number of those supported in this operation.
                     A deterioration in Mexico’s security situation could lead to some
                     backtracking in program outcomes, and impact fiscal
                     consolidation, investment and economic growth.           Increased
                     competition on the control of drug flows has led to a rise in
                     violence over the past few years. The Government is strengthening
                     and reorganizing its security forces to contain and reduce the
                     impact of organized crime in Mexico.

                         MEXICO FISCAL RISK MANAGEMENT
                           DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN



                                      I. INTRODUCTION

1.      The Government of Mexico has requested that the World Bank support the
strengthening of its Fiscal Risk Management Strategy through a Development Policy Loan
(DPL) for US$300,751,879.70. This document details recent policy actions undertaken in order
to reinforce the Government’s fiscal risk management framework and the support the Bank has
provided throughout the different stages of strategy design.

2.      Limited fiscal space and significant potential revenue losses or unexpected
expenditure outlays require careful identification and categorization of fiscal risks in
Mexico. The identification of a sovereign’s fiscal risks facilitates the implementation of
corresponding risk management measures, thereby safeguarding programmed public expenditure
programs. Revenue and expenditure volatility mitigation is important due to the effects budget
fluctuations and unplanned deficits can have on the macroeconomic environment, market
confidence, and ultimately creditworthiness of the country.

3.      This DPL supports the Government’s effort to minimize short-term fiscal risks and
therefore reduce disruptive adjustments during budget implementation. In the recently
published Criterios Generales de Política Económica, the Government distinguishes between
short-term fiscal risks (largely associated with macroeconomic shocks, though also with
unexpected expenditure outlays related to natural disasters and crises in the financial sector) and
long-term fiscal pressures (aging population and related higher pension and health costs). Short-
term fiscal risks generated by unexpected spending pressures or revenue losses may trigger
highly disruptive and costly ad hoc adjustments during annual budget implementation. The DPL
presents and evaluates progress in Mexico’s fiscal risk management strategy in three key policy
areas and suggests ways for improving and institutionalizing some of the measures. The first
policy area focuses on budget stability and transparency, which is a key element for any fiscal
risk management strategy. The remaining policy areas included in the DPL address two main
sources of short-term fiscal risks in the country: natural disaster risk management, and
subnational debt management. The loan highlights recent developments in each of the policy
areas and aims at strengthening the risk framework in its entirety.

4.      Fiscal risk management policies have enhanced Mexico’s resilience to shocks,
reduced public finance volatility, and enabled the Government to maintain planned
programs to address economic and social priorities. Mexico’s integrated fiscal risk mitigation
framework has evolved over the years and includes mechanisms to retain, mitigate and transfer
risk related to contingent as well as direct government liabilities. An integrated approach allows
for the establishment of a natural hedge between government assets and liabilities, determination
of economy-wide fiscal risks priorities, and improvement of institutional and technical capacity.
The Mexico’s fiscal risk mitigation framework is an evolving policy dialogue framework not yet
spelled out in a particular document.

                                                1 
 
5.      The proposed DPL is part of a complementary package of Bank knowledge and
financial services supporting fiscal risk management in Mexico. The operation is fully
consistent with the Bank’s new business model in Mexico, which emphasizes a strategic and
integrated client engagement in support of selected development outcomes through three main
lines of business; including financial, knowledge and convening services.

6.      World Bank engagement in Mexico on the fiscal risk management objectives
supported by this operation has been strong during the last years. Table 1, Bank
Engagement in Fiscal Risk Management, displays several financial, knowledge and convening
services, which the Bank supported over the last decade in the three policy areas. The following
examples describe some of the most notable Bank engagement in the policy areas (see Section
IV for a comprehensive overview):

(a) Budget Stability and Transparency
        Results-based management: The Bank collaborated with the Government to
          improve Federal Public Administration management, set in motion a new framework
          for result-based budgeting and produce high quality information on performance.
        Integrated financial management information system: The Bank provided fee-
          based advisory services to strengthen the integrated financial management
          information system (IFMIS).
(b) Natural Disaster Risk Management
        Catastrophe Bonds: Mexico was the first country to use the MultiCat program, a
          flexible catastrophe bond series developed by the Bank that allows for the pooling of
          multiple perils, regions and countries.
        Proposed DPL on Social Resilience to Climate Change: The Government has
          requested a Strengthening Social Resilience to Climate Change DPL aimed at
          reducing the impact of climate change and, in turn, natural disasters on the poor.
(c) Subnational Debt Management
        Accounting Harmonization: The Bank has provided flexible, demand-based
          services to support the Government’s accounting reform. In addition, a report on
          Government accounting harmonization in Mexico was prepared in 2010.
        Fiscal Federalism: An earlier Bank analysis on fiscal federalism in Mexico is
          currently being followed up and updated by a study on fiscal federalism in Latin
          America.

7.      The DPL fits into the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS),
Mexico’s presidency of the G20 and the Government’s request for financial services in
fiscal year 2012. The 2012 G20 agenda will continue to be heavily influenced by the current
uncertain economic and financial environment, in particular related to the European debt crisis.
Fiscal risk management, in particular related to macroeconomic risks, the international monetary
system and financial sector regulation, will remain high on the agenda.

Recent Economic Developments

8.      The Mexican economy rapidly recovered from the impact of the global economic
crisis. After a severe contraction in late 2008 and early 2009, resurgence in demand for Mexican
manufactured exports led to a sharp rebound of economic activity. By the end of 2010 output
returned to its pre-crisis level, with an upturn in domestic demand sustaining growth of 5.4
percent for the year, and supporting convergence to the country’s potential output.

9.       Strong links between the Mexican and U.S. manufacturing industry contributed to a
surge in external trade. With almost 80 percent of trade directed to the U.S., a recovery of
economic activity and, in particular, of industrial production in the U.S. led to a sharp rebound of
Mexican exports. Manufactured exports increased by 30 percent in 2010, surpassing their pre-
crisis level, and continued to expand at a healthy annual rate of 14 percent in 2011. The rapid
expansion of exports led to an increase of Mexico’s market share in the U.S. to over 12 percent
from 10.5 percent prior to the crisis. Recent external competitiveness gains are the result of
moderate wage growth, a relatively weaker peso and higher global transport costs.

10.     The recovery spurred a moderate increase in employment. Though the Mexican labor
market is recovering from the trough, unemployment remains above pre-crisis levels. The
unemployment rate, which reached a record high of 6.4 percent in September 2009, has remained
over 5 percent over the last two years, two percent above the average pre-crisis level. After net
job destruction in 2009, approximately 500 thousand formal sector jobs have been created
annually leaving an equal number of net labor force entrants to look for other alternatives in self-
or informal sector employment. Over the past four years, real wages in the formal sector have
languished, compared to an annual average increase of one percent previous to the crisis.

11.     After more than a decade of rapid growth, outward migration and remittances have
stagnated. Recent population census data show that the number of Mexican migrants in the U.S.
remained at 12 million between 2007 and 2010, compared to an estimated average annual net
migration of 500 thousand in the preceding years. This is likely due to tighter migration controls
and the downturn of U.S. economic activity, in particular in the construction sector. As a result,
annual remittance inflows of US$22.7 billion in 2011 are still 13 percent below their end-2007
peak. The impact of the slump in remittances in terms of purchasing power, poverty relief and
domestic consumption was somewhat mitigated by currency depreciation in 2008-2009 and more
recently in the second half of 2011.

12.     Credit growth has recovered and is now in line with nominal Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) growth. Consumer and corporate credit have expanded at an annual nominal
rate of about 12 percent. Housing finance has trailed behind, with 10 percent annual nominal
growth, partly attributed to the demise of the specialized housing non-bank financial
intermediaries (Sociedades Financieras de Objeto Limitado - SOFOLES). Commercial banks
non-performing loan ratio remains at 2.7 percent and is adequately provisioned for.
Provisioning levels (180 percent) are significantly higher than in the rest of the region

13.     The authorities are gradually withdrawing the fiscal stimulus to reassure markets of
Mexico’s fiscal sustainability. Fiscal discipline and strong fiscal policy frameworks, including
the establishment of stabilization funds and the acquisition of oil price hedges, provided the
authorities with some space to conduct countercyclical policy during the height of the crisis
without jeopardizing long-term sustainability. Fiscal stimulus in 2009 was mainly financed by
non-recurrent revenue that was no longer available in 2010, when the authorities initiated a
program of fiscal consolidation by increasing taxes and containing public expenditures. To
moderate the withdrawal of fiscal support a modest budget deficit was allowed in 2010, 2011 and
2012, with a return to a balanced budget as stipulated in Mexico’s fiscal responsibility law
envisaged for 2013.1

14.    Monetary policy remains accommodative after substantial easing in 2009. The sharp
contraction of economic activity in 2009 created a particularly large output gap, suggesting that
the economy may, for the medium-term, expand moderately above its potential without
generating inflation pressures. Consumer price inflation has trended down for the major part of
2011, and is currently at 3.8 percent within the authorities’ target interval of 3 plus/minus 1
percent.

15.     International reserve accumulation and a new International Monetary Fund (IMF)
Flexible Credit Line (FCL) strengthen Mexico’s insurance against external shocks. The
buildup of international reserves stems from net public sector foreign exchange receipts, due to
elevated oil prices, and the introduction of a rules based mechanism that enables market
participants to sell foreign exchange to the Central Bank. Gross international reserves now stand
at US$142 billion, an increase of US$29 billion over the last twelve months. A new FCL was
contracted with the IMF in January 2011 for a two-year period for approximately US$73 billion.

16.     Over the past two years Mexico experienced substantial capital inflows, mainly
directed at the domestic government bond market. Loose global monetary conditions and
inclusion of Mexican local currency government bonds in Citibank’s World Government Bond
Index (WGBI) in October 2010 led to a surge of capital inflows of about US$16 billion in the
last half of 2010 and first half of 2011, respectively. However, increased global risk aversion has
recently put pressure on asset and currency markets. Mexico’s flexible exchange rate and
increased financial cushion (reserves and the FCL) should help mitigate the effect of a sudden,
sharp reversal in capital flows.

17.    The Mexican authorities recently adjusted their foreign exchange intervention
mechanism in response to sharply increased market volatility. The higher degree of risk
aversion on the back of the European sovereign debt and banking sector problems has triggered a
sharp depreciation of the peso and increased the volatility of the Mexican peso/US dollar
exchange rate. To reduce market volatility, the authorities reintroduced in end-November 2011 a
rules-based foreign exchange intervention mechanism that announces the auction of US$400
million on days when the Mexican peso has depreciated by 2 percent or more compared to the

 The budget balance targeted in the Fiscal Responsibility Law excludes investments in the oil sector amounting to about 2
percent of GDP annually over the past couple of years. A broader deficit measure like the Public Sector Borrowing
Requirements (PSBR) does include these outlays as well as additional adjustments for concepts such as inflation-indexed debt
and financial intermediation by development banks.

                                                               6 
 
previous day. At the same time, the authorities suspended the monthly sale of dollar put options
through which the Central Bank accumulated additional international reserves. The measure
aims at enhancing liquidity conditions in the foreign exchange market and therefore reducing
MXN/USD volatility.

18.    Food price inflation and the economic crisis have increased poverty over the past
few years. Total poverty increased from 44.5 to 46.2 percent between 2008 and 2010, according
to a new official poverty measure. Approximately a quarter of the poor, 10.4 percent of the total
population in 2010, live in extreme poverty. These figures are the result of a new poverty
measure based on a multidimensional concept of poverty. Though no historical time series of the
new poverty measure exist, the previous income-based poverty measure exhibited a reversal in
the declining trend of poverty as of 2008. The initial increase was largely attributed to rising
food prices, whereas the recent increase in poverty levels is mainly due to the economic crisis
and labor market slack.
Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability

19.     Economic growth has moderated but is forecast to remain healthy in 2012.
Economic growth has moderated to about 3.8 percent in 2011. Growth in 2012 is projected to
slow to 3.3 percent, and stabilize at 3.5 over the medium-term (see base case scenario Table 2).2
Despite a slowdown in U.S. growth, external demand will likely remain buoyed by growth in
U.S. industrial production and improved Mexican external competitiveness. Domestic demand is
expected to remain expansionary and driven by labor market improvements, credit growth and
infrastructure investment. Downside risks to growth, associated with a U.S. slowdown and the
ongoing problems in Europe, remain significant.

20.     A lower case growth scenario may materialize if Mexico’s main trading partner falls
back into a recession in the near term (see Box 1). Weaker demand for Mexican exports and a
slowdown in investment may lead to a below potential rate of growth in the short term, 2012, of
about 2.0 percent. Such a low case scenario also includes a return to the lower bound of
Mexico’s medium-term potential output growth range at 3.0 percent and impacts the
Government’s fiscal and debt projections. A greater emphasis on growth-oriented structural
reforms is crucial to improve Mexico’s medium-term growth potential, which is driven by
growth of the labor force and capital accumulation but remains constrained by lack of any
significant productivity improvements.

21.     Mexico’s security situation continues to impact growth and pose challenges for the
authorities. The growing violence, in particular in northern Mexico, stems from the conflict
between drug cartels and among cartels and Mexican security services. The domestic security
threat is undermining economic growth and investment, in particular in the areas most impacted
by violent crime. As a result, improving public security remains one of the Government’s
priorities. Increasing resources needed to address the rise in violence could detract from
spending on social needs and public investment.

    Box 1

             Weakening global growth prospects and increased financial volatility: Impact on Mexico

    Extraordinary downward adjustments in the prospects for global economic activity and extremely high
    global financial market volatility have been observed over the past few months. Since end-July 2011,
    global markets have suffered major financial turbulence and a flight from risky assets, related to weak
    economic activity and fiscal problems in the U.S., the sovereign debt crisis in several European countries
    and associated weakness in the European banking system. The perceived lack of political resolve in both
    regions significantly increases downside risks to the world economy.

    Weakening growth prospects in advanced economies, in particular in the U.S., and global financial market
    volatility led to rapid adjustment in Mexico’s growth prospects and currency valuation. Private sector
    analysts’ average growth estimates1 for 2011 and 2012 fell from 4.2 and 4.1 percent respectively to 3.8
    and 3.4 percent within a period of two months (July-September). The deteriorating outlook and flight to
    quality led to a depreciation of the peso by 16 percent between end-July and beginning December,
    reversing the gradual appreciation trend that followed the currency collapse during the 2008-2009
    financial crisis.

    Rapidly deteriorating domestic growth prospects are due to the strong links between Mexican industry and
    the U.S. economy, the market for almost 80 percent of Mexican manufactured exports. Weakening
    external demand also has an important impact on the service sector as the share of services directly linked
    to manufacturing in Mexico is high by international standards (Organization for Economic Co-operation
    and Development -OECD 2011). An external demand shock generated by the U.S. falling back into
    recession would create a substantial short-term impact on economic growth in Mexico.

    An abrupt decline in commodity prices and of oil in particular, would have a negative impact on economic
    activity and the trade balance, though lower oil production has reduced net oil exports to less than one
    percent of GDP thereby significantly diminishing the terms of trade effect of oil price fluctuations. In
    terms of public finances, a reduction of the oil price by US$10 per barrel reduces public sector revenue by
    0.3 percent of GDP.

    The recent sharp currency depreciation suggests a reversal in capital flows. In the year prior to the current
    instability (July 2010-June 2011), investment by foreign residents in peso-denominated government bonds
    amounted to US$32 billion, while international reserves increased by US$28 billion. The policy response
    to what has been perceived as a disorderly depreciation and excess volatility of the peso dollar exchange
    rate has been to intervene in the foreign exchange market through a rules based mechanism that has been
    applied earlier with success (see Paragraph 17). The weaker peso has led to some easing of monetary
    conditions, however concerns about a pass-through to domestic prices are relatively muted in the current
    environment of low inflation and weakening economic activity.

22.    Uncertainty over the global outlook and a more moderate domestic growth outlook
will continue to restrain price pressures. Annual headline consumer price inflation, 3.8
percent by the end of 2011, maintains a downward trend, approaching Bank of Mexico’s medium
term target. A deceleration in the economic recovery is slowing the closure of the output gap,
suggesting that monetary conditions can remain relatively accommodative.

                                                                8 
 
23.    The current account deficit has widened moderately with the upturn in domestic
demand. Mexico’s current account deficit will likely widen to around 0.9 percent of GDP in
2011, and be financed via FDI investment, projected at US$20 billion. Export growth, projected
at approximately 18 percent in 2011, will likely moderate over the medium term, and average
approximately 9 percent annually, while the current account deficit may widen but remain
financeable by FDI. Remittances are projected to amount to $22.7 billion in 2011 and may
increase modestly if the economic environment in the U.S. improves.

24.      The Government remains on track with its fiscal consolidation plan. The fiscal
deficit, in terms of the Public Sector Borrowing Requirements (PSBR), is expected to narrow to
2.9 percent of GDP in 2011 and the Government plans on a further deficit reduction to 2.8
percent in 2012. Stronger oil related revenues are compensating for slightly weaker tax revenue.
Similar to 2010 and 2011, the Government has removed the caps on the stabilization funds for
2012.

25.      Improvements in Mexico’s debt structure mitigate the impact of shocks on public
finances. The Government’s debt management strategy continues to favor the local debt market,
and use external financing in a complementary manner. Due to ongoing uncertainty and
volatility in international financial markets, Mexico will continue to meet the Government’s
financing needs with the lowest cost and risk combination of internal and external debt, while
strengthening local debt markets and maintaining a diverse access to credit.

26.      A return to a balanced budget3 as of 2013 would ensure a sustainable public debt
path. The public sector debt-to-GDP ratio increased over the past few years mainly due to the
partial inclusion in 2008 of public sector workers’ pension liabilities in public debt following the
ISSSTE (Instituto de Seguridad Social al Servicios de los Trabajadores del Estado)-pension
reform, the fiscal stimulus program and sharp drop in economic activity in 2009. Nevertheless,
Mexico maintains a moderate net public debt-to-GDP ratio at about 37 percent and the
Government’s medium-term fiscal framework foresees a 2 percent reduction in the debt-to-GDP
ratio over the next five years.

27.     The main risk to the public debt-to-GDP ratio is the uncertainty surrounding the
GDP growth rate. The Government’s medium-term fiscal projections show a declining debt-to-
GDP path based on a diminishing PSBR from 2.3 percent of GDP in 2013 to 2.0 percent in 2017
and annual economic growth of 3.9 percent. Net debt-to-GDP diminishes under these
assumptions from 36.3 percent in 2013 to 34.6 percent in 2017. The base case scenario presented
in Table 2 projects annual medium-term growth of 3.5 percent, which maintains a downward
debt-to-GDP path towards a ratio of 35.4 percent by 2017, whereas a low case scenario of 3
percent annual growth would roughly stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term.

        28.    Despite significant      foreign ownership, Mexico’s financial sector remains relatively
        insulated from problems          in Europe. Strong capitalization levels and prudential policies
        implemented over the last       few years have strengthened the sector’s vulnerability to shocks.
        Though foreign ownership        is significant in the banking sector and ring fencing measures are

                                                                10 
         
difficult to implement, recent policies including tighter limits on dividend distribution and
related-party lending should limit contagion from the European banking sector. However, a
sovereign default and/or ongoing instability in European debt markets would reinforce global
risk aversion, intensify stock market volatility, heighten capital outflows and tighten domestic
credit growth. Furthermore, Mexican institutional investors (pension, mutual and insurance
funds) could experience asset losses, which could in turn generate domestic market instability.

29.    Notwithstanding the significant challenges posed by the current global economic
climate, Mexico’s macroeconomic policy framework is considered adequate for the
purposes of the proposed Development Policy Loan.


                          III. THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

30.    The strengthening of fiscal sustainability through revenue and expenditure volatility
mitigation and tax revenue strengthening has been a long standing objective in Mexico.
Despite the Government’s sustained effort to strengthen non-oil tax revenue, Mexico maintains a
low level of tax to GDP constraining fiscal space. Low tax collection, significant social needs
and the limitations imposed by adherence to the balanced budget rule, have led the Government
to implement a number of measures that mitigate public finance volatility.

31.     One of the objectives of this administration is to modernize all levels of government
budget preparation and execution, while improving the efficiency and transparency of
public sector accounts. Greater transparency facilitates the proper identification of fiscal risks
and is the first step toward retaining, transferring or mitigating them. While the administration
has focused substantially on public access to information, they also seek to promote
accountability and reduce corruption. The Government’s focus on transparency involves the
improvement of public expenditure efficiency through results based budgeting, harmonization of
accounting standards between the three levels of Government, and the ongoing modernization of
Mexican Treasury through the implementation of a Single Treasury Account (STA). While
adoption of the STA serves to enhance budget stability and transparency, it also supports the
Government’s program of advancing access to finance to a large segment of the Mexican
population. The electronic payment through the STA of government payroll, pensions and cash-
transfer programs is supporting the access to formal financial sector products and services to
larger segments of the population.

32.     In an effort to further improve fiscal transparency the Government included for the
first time an extended presentation on fiscal risks in the 2012 budget CGPE (Criterios
Generales de Política Económica). According to the section, public finances are vulnerable to
the following fiscal risks: macroeconomic short term risks (GDP growth, price of oil, oil
production, and interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations), longer term health and pensions
costs, development bank portfolios, risks associated with the Institución para la Protección al
Ahorro Bancario (IPAB – Mexico’s deposit insurance system), state-owned entities liabilities
and natural disaster costs. According to a sensitivity chart on 2012 revenue and expenditure
flows, macroeconomic variables, in particular oil production, oil price and GDP growth
variability have the largest impact on fiscal variables. Unexpected outlays, related to natural

                                                11 
 
disasters or epidemics can also place a heavy burden on the budget. The section includes a
discussion on mitigation measures undertaken in each area and information on remaining
challenges.

33.     The Government continues to work to strengthen fiscal and debt sustainability and
transparency at the national and subnational level. From the onset of the current
administration’s term the Government has promoted the harmonization of government
accounting standards and practices between all levels of government. The full implementation
by end 2012 of the General Law on Government Accounting adopted in 2007 should improve
the compilation and dissemination of public finance statistics, especially for states and
municipalities. The Government also streamlined and rationalized the federal transfer system
providing additional incentives for local revenue generation. More recently, the Government
updated bank provisioning rules for subnational borrowing in order to enhance sound fiscal and
financial practices by both lenders and borrowers.

34.     Progress on the Government’s debt management strategy, aimed at deepening local
debt markets, lowering costs and broadening the investor base, has resumed following the
global crisis. Debt managers have obtained most of the Federal government’s financing needs
in the local debt market, supporting the deepening and lengthening of the yield curve, while
successfully securing financing for external debt maturing in 2012. The use of syndication in the
Government’s debt strategy has promoted liquidity in the bond market, accelerated the
establishment of domestic benchmark bonds, expanded the investor base, and boosted eligibility
in a number of fixed income indices. As a result, in 2010 Mexico became the first Latin
American country to be incorporated in Citigroup’s World Government Bond Index (WGBI),
which with the recent launching of Cetes Directo, an electronic retail distribution system, has
broadened the investor base, and furthered the development of the Mexican financial system.

35.     In 2010 the Government announced an integral strategy built on an existing
framework for dealing with natural disasters. The strategy includes a number of reforms
largely initiated due to the elevated natural disaster costs incurred in 2010, and continues to
monitor and improve on risk mitigation strategies in order to reduce the impact of natural
disasters. In order to cope with the atypical destruction in 2010, the Government provided an
additional 20 billion Mexican pesos to the Natural Disaster Fund (FONDEN), and improved the
rules on disbursements. To help States with disaster financing, the Government created a
reconstruction Fund, to provide concessional financing and complement FONDEN resources.
Lastly, the Government purchased insurance against natural disasters and formulated a sector
specific plan to insure public infrastructure.

Consultative and participatory processes in Mexico’s economic policy formulation

36.    Mexico’s multi-branch Government and competitive political system provide the
background for ample discussion on government proposals. The measures within the budget
package are subject to a calendar preparation (April-August), presentation (early September) and
eventual approval by Congress (mid-November) that allows for extensive proposal deliberation,
the presentation of counter-proposals by Congress, and discussion among business chambers,
unions, civil society, special interest groups and the public in general.

                                               12 
 
37.     Advancements on public sector and budget transparency are supporting
information sharing and improving fiscal policy discussions. The Government recently
launched a website bringing together the most relevant budget information published by SHCP
(Secretaria de Hacienda y Crédito Publico).4 The website on budgetary transparency provides
the necessary tools to understand Government expenditure trends and goals in a clear and
concise manner. The website provides historical, as well as current data, and therefore aims to
also serve as a data resource for analysts.

38.    Relevant stakeholders were extensively consulted in the elaboration of FONDEN’s
rules of operations. More than 180 meetings were carried out with representatives of the
relevant sectors including, inter alia, the housing sector, the urban infrastructure sector, the water
and sanitation sector, and the education sector. In addition, States participated in the consultative
process by sending proposals which were taken into account in the final version of the rules of
operation.

39.     Another level of public consultation occurs through the Federal Commission for
Regulatory Improvement (COFEMER). The agency is responsible for the promotion of
transparent development and implementation of regulatory reform policies. Drafts of changing
regulations are subject to a regulatory impact assessment and publicly available at COFEMER’s
website, giving citizens and civil society organizations an opportunity to comment. For example,
the recent change in bank’s provisioning rules for subnational lending was included in the
COFEMER website for public consultation.


                            IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

Link to World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy

40.     The World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) and the CPS
Progress Report were presented to the Board in March 2008 (Report No. 42846-MX) and
February 2010 (Report No. 52776-MX), respectively. The proposed operation is in line with
the CPS Progress Report which envisioned an active program of financial services during fiscal
year 2012 in response to the Government’s request. Moreover, the proposed operation is part of
a larger programmatic engagement in the area of budget stability and transparency, natural
disaster risk management, and subnational public finance.
World Bank engagement

41.     World Bank engagement in Mexico on the fiscal risk management objectives
supported by this operation has been strong. The Bank has supported Mexico’s integrated
fiscal risk management framework through a range of financial and knowledge services. The
following examples are illustrative (see Table 1 for a comprehensive overview):

(a) Budget Stability and Transparency
       Results-based management: The Bank collaborated with the Government to
          improve Federal Public Administration management, set in motion a new framework
          for result-based budgeting and produce high quality information on performance.
          Encouragement of public sector officials and legislative policy makers to employ this
          information when taking decisions, improved the efficiency and effectiveness of
          public spending significantly.
       Integrated financial management information system: The Bank provided fee-
          based advisory services to strengthen the integrated financial management information
          system (IFMIS). A robust IFMIS is essential at all stages of the budget process to
          help promote sound fiscal management and performance-informed budgeting.

(b) Natural Disaster Risk Management
        Catastrophe Bonds: Mexico was the first country to use the MultiCat program, a
          flexible catastrophe bond series developed by the Bank that allows for the pooling of
          multiple perils, regions and countries. Mexico issued a US$290 million bond in
          October 2009, which provides three year coverage for three specific risks –
          earthquakes (three areas around Mexico City), Pacific hurricanes (two areas) and
          Atlantic hurricanes (namely the area around Cancun).
        Proposed DPL on Social Resilience to Climate Changes: The Government
          requested a Strengthening Social Resilience to Climate Change DPL of
          US$300,751,879.70 to be presented to the Board for approval in March 2012. The
          Project aims to help the Government reduce the impact of climate change on the poor
          through sustainable territorial development, increased preparedness and reduced
          vulnerability to natural disasters.

(c) Subnational Debt Management
        Accounting Harmonization: The Bank has provided flexible, demand-based
          services to support the Government’s accounting reform, by providing assistance in
          the accounting law design and supporting its implementation. In addition, a report on
          Government accounting harmonization in Mexico was prepared in 2010.
        Fiscal Federalism: An earlier Bank analysis on fiscal federalism in Mexico is
          currently being followed up and updated by a study on fiscal federalism in Latin
          America.5 The analysis provides detailed research on the state of affairs and new
          developments related to fiscal federalism and decentralization in Mexico.
 

Links between the DPL and Prior Analytical Work

42.     Bank analytical work has contributed to the improvement of budget stability and
transparency and the design of natural disaster and subnational risk management. A wide-
ranging body of analytical work has provided the basis for a policy dialogue with the
Government and supported the design of the DPL. The table below shows the links between the
prior actions included in the DPL and the recommendations included in recent analytical work.

         Analytical Work                               Findings and Recommendations


    A.     Budget Stability and Transparency

                            Transparency rules have acquired importance since the mid-1990s with the passage
                            of laws that establish free access of information and dissemination of fiscal results.

                            investors does not exceed that of issuing through wholesale markets. Greater use of
                            electronic services is a promising avenue.
    B. Natural Disaster Risk Management
                            A sovereign risk financing strategy aims at strengthening the capacity of the
                            Government to respond following a natural disaster while protecting its fiscal
    Ghesquiere and Mahul balance. A number of instruments are available to build such a strategy, each with its       B-1
    (2010), “Financial      own cost structure and characteristics. An effective financial strategy against natural   (FONDEN

    Disasters?              profile after a disaster.
                            Natural disasters can put severe strains on public finances, in particular in
                            developing and small countries. Catastrophe insurance markets increasingly offer
                            opportunities for the transfer of such risks. Thus far, developing countries have only
                            tepidly begun to tap these opportunities. More frequent and intensive use of
    Hofman and Brukoff      insurance markets may be desirable because it could help introduce an important           B-2
    (2006), “Insuring       element of predictability in post-disaster public finances of disaster-prone              (stop-loss

                            commercial insurance. Such a shift would help reduce the fiscal second-round
                            effects, thereby limiting economic disruption and facilitating faster recovery.


                                                                 15 
 
    C.   Subnational Debt Management
                           Decentralization in Mexico redistributed decision-making across the three levels of       D-1 (lending to
    Giugale and Webb, ed. government (federal, state, and municipal) and made it more accountable to the             SNGs)
    (2000), “Achievement   average citizen. It also gave subnational governments a renewed role as economic
                           agents. The taxation, spending, borrowing, and institutions of Mexican states and

                           municipalities placed them increasingly (albeit unevenly) under the rigor of market

    Decentralization: the
    case of Mexico?.
                           Ex-ante fiscal rules for subnational governments (SNGs) debt financing can also be
    Canuto and Liu         supported by regulation on lenders. To improve fiscal transparency, Mexico
    (2010), “Subnational   introduced a credit-rating system for SNGs. Although the credit rating is voluntary,      D-1

                           subnational credits.
                           Two key questions relate to how to select fiscal indicators for regulating subnational
                           government debt financing and how these fiscal indicators relate to subnational

                           Second, what are the standard thresholds for each of these ratios that are normally
                           used in assessing whether a subnational's fiscal framework is sustainable or not? It is
                           an empirical question and the threshold is country period specific, and depends on
                           the growth rate, primary balance, interest rate and government creditworthiness.
                           Higher growth rate, lower interest rate and conservative fiscal policies are often
                           correlated with a higher debt limit.

Lessons Learned

43.    The design of the proposed operation takes into account the lessons learned from the
overall program with Mexico, previous DPLs, in particular the recent Economic Policies in
Response to the Global Crisis6, as well as the Development Policy Lending Retrospective
(2009).7 The most important lessons include the following:
     Operations should focus on actions that are critical to the achievement of the
       program’s objectives and avoid covering too many policy areas. The proposed DPL
       matrix has sought to concentrate on the most recent policy actions that enhance Mexico’s
       fiscal risk management framework. The selection of the policy areas and prior actions
       follows extensive consultations with the Government and, based on the experience of
       earlier DPLs, the number of prior actions has been limited.
     Strong country ownership, coalition-building and political economy considerations are
       critical to success. The proposed operation responds to the Government’s request to
       support policy areas that are central to its risk management strategy and, which follow
       consultations with stakeholders according to the country’s institutional framework as
       described in paragraph 36-39. Experience has shown that without strong country
       ownership the risk of policy reform reversal is high.

             Prior strong analytical work and continued engagement is a necessary precondition.
              The World Bank has maintained a fruitful dialogue with the Government on all the policy
              areas supported by the proposed operation. While strong government and country
              ownership underlies the prior actions contained in the proposed operation, the World
              Bank’s global knowledge and analytical work has informed the design and discussion
              surrounding these policies.
             Strategic engagement and support needs to complement policy lending. The
              Government has requested the Bank’s support in the areas of natural disaster risk
              management and budget stability and transparency enhancement. The experience with
              developing and providing comprehensive analytic and advisory packages on priority
              issues, as a complement to policy lending, has served to ensure that policy development
              is predicated upon a sound and strategic analytic basis. On disaster risk management, the
              Bank is providing technical assistance to the Government for the MultiCat bond renewal
              and starting advisory knowledge services on strengthen its comprehensive financial
              protection strategy and its disaster risk reduction monitoring and evaluation system.
             Need for a sound and well-structured monitoring system and transparent progress
              review. Measuring impact requires the identification of indicators that are closely linked
              to the prior actions endorsed by the operation. Outcome indicators have been agreed with
              the Government as reflected in the Policy Matrix. The Bank will monitor closely the
              impact of the policy actions supported by the DPL and progress towards the agreed
              impact indicators. A framework with the SHCP and other agencies involved in the
              program will be developed so that they will provide regular information on the outcome
              indicators. Monitoring of outcome indicators will also be supported by supervision
              missions. Such coordination will avoid the problems identified in some earlier DPLs,
              where program implementation responsibilities were not clearly established from the
              onset.
Collaboration with other Development Partners

44.    The World Bank and IMF conduct regular consultations on Mexico’s
macroeconomic situation. The meetings involve the exchange of analytical reports carried out
by the respective institutions. Structural issues are often discussed during these meetings,
especially financial sector issues since both institutions are engaged in policy advice in this area.
The World Bank and IMF recently jointly completed the 2011-12 Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP) update.

45.     In July 2011, the IMF published Mexico’s Article IV Consultation Staff Report. The
report attributed the economy’s robust rebound from the crisis to Mexico’s strong fundamentals
and skillful policy making. Mexico signed a new Flexible Credit Line (FCL) for approximately
US$73 billion in January 2011, increasing the country’s access to liquid resources and providing
a significant buffer against potential tail risks.8 Mexico was the first country to request this
instrument, which is treated as precautionary by the Government. The IMF provided the
Government with technical assistance related to tax policy, fiscal risk management, national
accounts and the fiscal framework within the last 2 years.

 A first FCL was contracted in April 2009, a second in March 2010, and the current FCL in January 2011 for a period of two
years. The annual review of qualifications for the FCL was completed in December 2011.

                                                               17 
 
46.     The World Bank maintains close collaboration with the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB). The exchange of views and sharing of documents enhances the
quality of project implementation, supervision and achievement of development objectives of
operations. The IDB has supported numerous projects in Mexico and published a number of
reports and working papers related to poverty, fiscal policy9and climate change.10 The IDB has
been very supportive of Mexico’s climate programs related to prevention and natural disaster
emergency response capacity. The IDB also recently arranged a working meeting with
specialists, academics, rating agencies, analysts, and public and commercial bank officials to
analyze Mexico’s subnational debt and suggest measures to improve monitoring and regulation.

                                                          V. THE PROPOSED OPERATION

Operation Description

47.    The Overall Program Development Objective is to support Mexico’s fiscal risk
management policies so as to foster the efficient and effective implementation of public
sector expenditure programs. This will be achieved by (i) supporting Mexico’s integrated risk
management approach, (ii) promoting the institutionalization of risk mitigation policies, and, (iii)
highlighting critical elements of Mexico’s risk management framework.

48.    The operation contains three policy areas: budget stability and transparency,
natural disaster risk management, and subnational debt management. Each policy area
summary will be divided into 4 sections: background, government actions, expected results, and
Government’s medium term reform agenda. A more complete analysis of each policy area is
included in the annex section of the document.

 Policy Area I: Budget Stability and Transparency

Background

49.     Prudent fiscal policies and improved public liability management have reduced
expenditure volatility in Mexico. Since 2006, fiscal policy has been guided by the balanced
budget rule and medium-term budgetary framework imbedded in the Fiscal Responsibility Law
(FRL). The FRL institutionalized Government efforts to contain fiscal deficits and stabilize debt
levels, while supporting accountability and transparency in the annual budget process. In
addition to the establishment of a balanced budget rule, the law also introduced a formula for
calculating oil prices in budget projections, and established four excess oil-revenue stabilization
funds. The current balanced budget rule has served well to build credibility.

  Such as the paper Fiscal Policy Reform in Latin America and the US$1 billion Program to Support the Consolidation of Fiscal
Sustainability loan (September 2010), which complemented the objectives of the Bank’s Economic Policies in Response to the
Global Crisis DPL and supported macroeconomic and financial stability, reduced fiscal vulnerability and improved the quality of
fiscal and financial management.

50.     Cash management optimization fostered budget stability and transparency.
Improvement in the management of public finances and in particular the establishment of the
Single Treasury Account (STA) in 2007 has augmented the efficiency and transparency of
budget execution. The centralization of cash balances within a single account optimizes cash
management by efficiently tracking cash flows, improving investment of liquid funds, and
allowing for better planning of debt issues. The direct receipt of federal government revenues
and direct payment to final beneficiaries’ bank accounts limit financial costs, strengthen financial
inclusion, and promote transparency in public accounts.

51.     A strengthened public debt profile limits public finance vulnerability to
macroeconomic short term fiscal risks. The substitution of external for domestic public sector
debt, and the phase out of currency-linked and increase in fixed-rate debt instruments have been
integral to Mexico’s debt management program, and have reduced vulnerabilities associated with
exchange and interest rate movements. The lengthening of the average maturity of local
Government bonds, to more than 7 years in 2011 from 1.5 in 2000, has reduced financing risk
and broadened the investor base.11 A longer average maturity for government debt, in addition to
sizeable international reserves also safeguards the economy should Europe’s debt crisis or the
U.S. slowdown prompt a sharp reversal of capital flows.  
 
Government Actions

52.    The Government has maintained its commitment to promote budget stability and
transparency and improve its debt management strategy. Budget stability and transparency
are crucial to foster the efficient and effective implementation of public expenditure programs
and avoid disruptive ad hoc adjustments during annual budget implementation. Optimizing the
debt management strategy is key to increase resilience to shocks and minimize risks. To achieve
these objectives, the Government launched Cetes Directo and moved forward the Single
Treasury Account agenda.

53.     The launching of Cetes Directo, an internet portal promoting the direct purchase of
government securities by retail investors, advances the Government’s effort to broaden the
investor base and develop deep and liquid public debt markets. The Cetes Directo platform
constitutes a new distribution channel of financial services able to meet the demand for small and
medium investors interested in low value investments. The traditional method for issuing
government debt is through auctions open just for wholesale investors and financial
intermediaries. A retail government debt program gives small investors the opportunity to buy
government securities at a lower cost without intermediaries. A similar scheme is already used
by countries such as United States (Treasury Direct), Brazil (Tesouro Direto), Spain (Tesoro
Público) and others. Recent modifications to the program, allowing for the fast track investment
in Cetes for low value amounts, and the ability to invest through additional wireless devices
(such as cellular phones) broaden the scope and mechanism for retail investment in government
instruments.

54.    Modernization of the Mexican Treasury through the improvement of its processes
and streamlining of revenue and payment flows through the STA supports budget stability
                                                            
11
     The pushing out of local debt tenors also improves the reference point for companies selling bonds.

                                                                 19 
 
and transparency. While federal government payments to the judiciary, legislative and other
autonomous agencies, for public debt and federal contributions to states are already channeled
through the STA, payment to suppliers and for contracts, revolving funds, payroll, subsidies,
budget advancements and trust funds are gradually being rolled out through the STA in 2011 and
2012. The Government recently issued regulation that advances through the STA the payment of
pensions for those insured by the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) and the Instituto
de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado (ISSSTE). Currently,
approximately 70 percent of the public budget is channeled through the STA. The recent
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certification of TESOFE’s (Tesorería de la
Federación) processes provides a set of standardized requirements for quality management
systems, and is in line with international best practices.

                           Policy Area 1: Budget Stability and Transparency
Objective: (i) Improve fiscal and public debt management practices
           (ii) Enhance budget stability and transparency

Prior Actions:                                                 Outcome Indicators:

 The Government issued a Decree which, inter alia, fosters the
implementation of electronic payments through the Single
Treasury Account, including the payment of pensions under
the Federal Government’s responsibility.

Expected results

55.     The Cetes Directo operation will further the Government’s efforts to broaden
Mexico’s retail investor base. The incorporation of a large, diversified, and largely untapped
investor base could over time lower the cost of public sector borrowing and reduce the volatility
of financing needs. Furthermore, the program promotes transparency and accountability of the
Government’s debt management policies. At the micro-level, savings through Cetes Directo
provides individuals with an additional instrument against temporary shocks to income by
supporting consumption smoothing. The outcome of the operation is being measured by looking
at the number of registered customers and the amount invested through the portal. Progress can
be assessed using international benchmarks as similar programs have been launched in other
countries, such as Brazil (Tesouro Direto). In its first year of operation, Cetes Directo managed
to register 34,000 customers, while 7,000 accounts have formally purchased approximately 478
million pesos of government instruments through the Internet platform. It is expected that Cetes
Directo will reach 15,000 customers by end of 2012, with the invested amount increasing to 1
billion pesos. Over the medium term, it is expected that the number of customers may increase
to 100,000 and the amount invested reach 10 billion pesos.

56.    ISO certification guarantees TESOFE’s transparency, accountability and continual
improvement in services rendered. Twenty seven substantive processes have been certified in
2011 dealing with treasury operations, accounting, monitoring, and legal units. The certification
endorses Mexico’s treasury processes and quality standards, and ensures that the latter are
recognized throughout the world. The accreditation will also enhance staff’s professional image
and support educational training.

57.    The incorporation of additional revenue and expenditure line items into the single
treasury account will consolidate cash resources, increase budget transparency and
generate savings for the Federal Government. Over the past 4 years Government savings
from tax collection through the STA have amounted to US$139 million. The incorporation of
the payment of pensions will channel an additional 25 percent of the budget through the STA,
while the annual number of payments made through the system will likely increase from 15
million to 25 million by end 2012. The modernization project continues to improve the quality
of public spending, reinforces accountability and is in line with international best practices.

Government’s medium-term reform agenda

58.     Adoption of a new Treasury Law will support the progress made on budget stability
and transparency. The law, currently in draft form, should update regulation related to the
implemented operational and legal changes, and address legal gaps and technological changes in
the payment system and TESOFE. The Government continues to work on improvements to the
final text of the draft Treasury Law, while engaging in consultations with external actors. The
draft Treasury Law designates the STA as the backbone of the Treasury’s operations, with
TESOFE in charge of all cash management. Finally, the draft Treasury Law would seek to be
more concise and consistent with international best practices.

59.     Budget stability and transparency would benefit from the institutionalization of the
oil price hedge and lifting of the stabilization fund caps. Such a policy action would mitigate
the risk of backtracking and reinforce the establishment of a number of key elements of
Mexico’s fiscal risk management framework. A removal of the caps would create a more
effective fiscal buffer by promoting greater savings during economic upturns and periods of high
oil prices in order to respond to large negative shocks. Likewise, the institutionalization of
Mexico’s oil hedging program would reduce the pressure to use these funds for other needs, such
as to meet budget shortfalls. Adoption of a structural fiscal rule would further smooth spending
patterns over time and reduce the pro-cyclicality of expenditure observed under the current rule.
 

Policy Area II: Natural Disaster Risk Management

Background

60.    Natural disaster risk is high in Mexico. Mexico is highly vulnerable to a number of
natural hazards, with approximately 41 percent of Mexico’s territory and 31 percent of its
population exposed to hurricanes, storms, floods, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. In
economic terms, this translates into 30 percent of GDP at risk from three or more hazards and 71
percent at risk from two or more hazards. Population growth and increased concentration of

                                               21 
 
physical assets in highly exposed areas has led to heightened vulnerability to adverse events,
while unplanned and unregulated land use, lack of environmental controls and poor application
of building standards exacerbates asset losses.

61.     The Government has pursued an integrated approach to disaster risk management,
involving the assessment, prevention, and transfer of fiscal risks. The current risk financing
strategy includes a variety of financing components, ranging from budgetary reserve funds and
prevention through build-back-better schemes to private risk transfer instruments such as specific
sector insurance policies, reinsurance and catastrophe bonds. Assessment of the Federal
Government’s infrastructure at risk has facilitated the transfer of some of Mexico’s low-
frequency high-cost natural disaster risk through a number of insurance products.

62.     The National Fund for Natural Disasters (FONDEN), a key player in Mexico’s
disaster risk management strategy, was established in 1996 to support natural disaster
emergency response and reconstruction. FONDEN protects the Mexican population (through
immediate relief response), its public assets (through reconstruction financing), and (uninsured)
low-income housing from disasters that exceed Federal and State governments and agencies
financial response capacity. It is jointly managed by the Ministry of Interior (SEGOB) and the
Ministry of Finance (SHCP) and uses various instruments to support federal and state
governments and federal agencies response to natural disasters, including reserve funds and risk
transfer solutions. FONDEN, a multi-annual trust fund, receives an annual budget allocation to
assure the availability of at least 0.4 percent of total programmable public expenditure at the
beginning of each budget year. In 2006, FONDEN issued a US$160 million catastrophe bond
(CatMex) to transfer some of Mexico’s earthquake risk to the international capital markets. In
October 2009, it issued a multi-peril three year (2009-2012) Cat bond using the World Bank’s
newly established MultiCat Program, which enables the pooling of perils across multiple regions
to reduce insurance costs.

Government Actions

63.     In 2011, the Government reformed FONDEN’s operating rules to more efficiently
allocate fund resources. The new rules allow Federal and State Governments to independently
finance and manage reconstruction activities. Previously, Federal and State contributions were
placed in a common financial vehicle from which all expenditures were paid once both entities
had committed the necessary funds. Under the new scheme, the federal government is
responsible for the full reconstruction of damaged federal infrastructure and for fifty percent of
the affected State infrastructure, with the State responsible for the remaining half.

64.    In June 2011, the Federal Government successfully concluded the purchase in the
reinsurance market of a stop-loss insurance against catastrophic events. The indemnity-
based reinsurance product for MXN 4.8 billion (approximately US$390 million) in excess of
MXN 12.5 billion (US$ 1 billion) further strengthens the Government’s budgetary resources
through the transfer of some catastrophic risk. Reinsurance payouts are triggered when the
resources allocated to FONDEN result insufficient to pay the costs associated with
reconstruction. The insurance would provide up to MXN 4.8 billion to finance reconstruction
without the need to allocate extraordinary resources from the budget or cut funds assigned to
other important programs. The insurance product is valid for one-year but is in the process of

                                               22 
 
being renewed for both financial and governance reasons. Besides further integrating Mexico’s
disaster risk management strategy, the insurance product optimizes the damage assessment
process and reduces political pressures. The presence of a third party (the insurance company)
encourages adherence to damage assessment best practices.

                            Policy Area 2: Natural Disaster Risk Management
Objective: Improve the Government’s ability to respond to natural disasters and mitigate the impact of
natural disaster costs on the budget

Prior Actions:                                                            Outcome Indicators:
The Government issued an Agreement (Acuerdo) and                          Average time between the declaration of
FONDEN rules of operation to allow the States and Federal                 a natural disaster and access to
Government to independently finance and manage the                        FONDEN resources for infrastructure

Expected results

65.     FONDEN new rules of operation will significantly enhance reconstruction efficiency
and improve local risk management. Previous rules of operations caused reconstruction delays
since the execution of the reconstruction work started only if both Federal and State allocations
were fully disbursed and States often had difficulties in providing funding. The new scheme is
intended to help minimize these delays and expedite recovery. This should be reflected in the
reduction of the time for reconstruction. An indicator that is used by the FONDEN General
Directorate to measure the progress on reconstruction programs is the percentage of programs
closed during a given fiscal year with respect to the number of programs open at the beginning of
the same fiscal year. In 2010 this percentage was 26 percent. As a result of the new co-sharing
scheme, it is expected that this percentage will increase to 35 percent by December 2012. The
new rules will also likely improve local government risk management by encouraging
vulnerability reduction and risk financing mechanisms at the local level, since there are
incentives for the States to independently insure and improve local infrastructure.

66.     In addition, the new rules of operations support the reduction of the average time
between the request and the allocation of FONDEN reconstruction funds. According to
existing FONDEN indicators, the average time in 2010 between the request and allocation of
funds was 45 days.12 The time between the request and allocation of reconstruction funds is a
function of the type and size of the natural event. Large floods, such as the ones that occurred in
2010, delay damage assessments and slow down the allocation process. The reform of FONDEN
rules of operation simplify procedures and speed up the process of allocation of reconstruction
funds. According to FONDEN, the time between a request and allocation of funds should
decrease to 28 days by December 2012.

Government’s medium-term reform agenda

67.      In an effort to protect budgetary resources and promote risk sharing, FONDEN
regulation is encouraging local governments to develop a comprehensive risk management
strategy. The transfer of natural disaster risk through specific sector and/or local Government
insurance policies would further decrease natural disaster costs to the federal Government. A
subordinate level insurance would ensure an additional layer of protection before the release of
FONDEN reconstruction resources. Several federal agencies such as the Comisión Nacional del
Agua (CONAGUA - responsible for the water, sanitation, and hydraulic infrastructure at federal
level), Secretaría de Educación Pública (SEP - responsible for public schools and educational
institutions), and the Ministry of Health have already contracted insurance as a first layer of
protection against disasters. FONDEN is also promoting the establishment of local disaster
funds, in order to further decentralize natural disaster emergency response and reconstruction
financing. This is a key measure to encourage States to take more responsibility for state
infrastructures. Ultimately, FONDEN is aiming towards a decentralized disaster risk
management system where local governments have strong incentives to invest in risk reduction,
moving away from the current system whereby the federal government finances most of the
reconstruction.

68.     More effort on prevention is needed at the three levels of Government to reduce the
fiscal and human costs of natural disasters. Limited resources have been applied through the
Fondo para la Prevención de Desastres Naturales (FOPREDEN), with the vast majority of
budget allocations used for post-disaster reconstruction. However, increased attention is being
placed on ensuring that reconstruction activities ‘build back better’, thereby reducing the
exposure of public assets to disaster risks. Better urban planning and settlement regulation,
improved and enforced construction codes, and increased public education and awareness would
also reduce natural disaster costs.
 

Policy Area III: Subnational Debt Management

Background

69.     Mexico’s federalism is characterized by high vertical fiscal imbalances. Progressive
revenue centralization at the federal government level, coupled with expenditure decentralization
at the subnational level has resulted in a high dependence on federal transfers and low tax effort
by subnational governments. Transfers from the federal government represent the largest source
of funds for subnational governments at approximately 82 percent of total revenue, and are made
up of tax revenue shares (participaciones) representing about 32 percent of revenue and
expenditure-specific or earmarked grants (aportaciones) representing 50 percent of revenue.

70.     Subnational government revenue was hard hit by the 2008 crisis. Participaciones
experienced a 16 percent drop in 2009, in line with the fall in economic activity. The federal
government addressed the shortfall by transferring resources from the FEIEF (Fondo de
Estabilización de los Ingresos de las Entidades Federativas) to the States and Municipalities

                                               24 
 
through a securitization of future flows to the FEIEF.13,14 As reflected in Chart 2, the surge in
borrowing as of 2009, led to a significant increase in subnational debt, even excluding FEIEF
resources. Though the stock of subnational debt in Mexico is only 2.5 percent of GDP, it
amounts to 72 percent of annual non-earmarked transfers (participaciones).

71.      In 2009, the Government modified bank prudential regulations, which facilitated
access to finance for subnational entities. The easing of short-term bank lending prudential
regulations encouraged short-term borrowing. In particular, short-term debt was exempted from
a higher risk rating and the need to establish prudential reserves.15 As a consequence, short-term
debt increased significantly during the last two years. The rapid accumulation of short-term
liabilities resulted in unsustainable debt levels and fiscal problems in some States.

72.     Short-term credit was not always included in the federal debt registry resulting in
growing discrepancies between reported and actual subnational debt.16 According to the
ministry of Finance, States had 363 million pesos of debt of which only 314 million pesos were
registered with the federal government.17 The difference between these figures suggests the
presence of a relevant amount of short-term debt accumulated and unaccounted for in the

                                                            
13
   The Federal Government established the FEIEF in 2005. As the resources in the Fund (22 billion pesos) were insufficient to
address the 2009 shortfall in participaciones (of around 70 billion pesos), the Government designed a financial scheme to
securitize future flows of the FEIEF, leading to commercial and development bank’s lending 40 billion FEIEF collateralized
pesos to subnational governments. The additional resources cushioned the fall in revenue, with participaciones amounting to
only 2 percent below budget expectations. FEIEF resources are not included in the stock of subnational debt displayed in Chart
2..
14
   The Mexican Constitution allows subnational government borrowing in domestic currency and from Mexican residents only
and restricts the use of funds obtained from borrowings to productive investments.
15
   State legislatures have the right to define what constitutes debt and thus what needs to be approved by the local Congress.
Most states do not consider liabilities whose maturity is less than a year as debt with the result that no local Congressional
approval is needed for short term borrowing.
16
    The definition of short-term debt in terms of maturity–less than 180 days–is based on banking prudential regulation. State
public debt laws contain different definitions for short-term credits from financial intermediaries such as credits that have to be
paid before the end of the fiscal year or before the end of the term of the current administration.
17
   As of March 2011. 

                                                                                 25 
 
subnational debt registry. The States with the highest discrepancy, in terms of percent of
unregistered debt, are: Coahuila, Chihuahua, Michoacán, Tabasco and Zacatecas. The financial
distress of the state of Coahuila in 2011 took the authorities and market participants by surprise,
in part because there was misreporting and underreporting of the State’s debt and possibly fraud,
and also because these loans were not considered when monitoring loan concentration.

73.    An incomplete picture of subnational entities liability position heightened fiscal
risks and raised questions regarding the existing borrowing framework. Credit ratings were
used by bank regulators to assign capital risk weightings and prudential reserves for bank loans
to subnational governments. This regulatory framework encouraged states and larger
municipalities to obtain credit ratings, by one of the four approved rating agencies in Mexico—
Standard and Poor’s, Fitch, Moody’s and HR Ratings. However, the over dependence on rating
agencies and relaxing of regulations concerning short term debt reduced due diligence by some
financial institutions, led to high lending concentrations, and heightened fiscal risks.

Government Actions

74.      In September 2011, the Government modified banking regulation linking prudential
reserve requirements for lending to subnational entities to a comprehensive set of
indicators. As a result, reserve provisioning should more closely track the portfolio quality of
each institution. The structure of the new approach is largely based on Basel II risk models, and
incorporates multiple indicators evaluating willingness and ability to pay based on fiscal and
debt management ratios and on economic performance trends. The new credit risk assessment
shifts the responsibility for risk evaluation to the financial institutions providing credit. The new
regulation will reintroduce prudential reserve requirements on short-term debt and place a high
penalty on banks that do not adhere to the new rules.  Unregistered loans will be automatically
risk-weighted at 150 percent.

                            Policy Area 3: Subnational Debt Management
Objective: Enhance fiscal and debt sustainability of state and municipal governments

Prior Actions:                                                Outcome Indicators:
The Government issued a resolution which links prudential Registered debt as a percent of total
reserve requirements for lending to Subnational Entities to a debt.
comprehensive set of indicators.

Expected Results

75.     The new regulation will reduce the demand and stock of short term debt, gradually
eliminate the level of unregistered debt and strengthen bank due diligence. The
reintroduction of prudential reserve requirements for short-term debt will reduce subnational
short-term debt to more reasonable levels. The new credit assessment will require banks closer
engagement in the due diligence process and, in turn, demand more transparency from
subnational governments. The authorities anticipate that the new system will provide a better
estimate of the probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default, which should
more closely link reserve requirements with banks’ portfolio quality. The new regulation will
likely increase transparency and the share of registered-to-actual debt from 86.5 percent to 93

                                                   26 
 
percent by end of December 2012. Over the medium term, we expect the share of registered
debt to be very close to the total amount of subnational debt (>95 percent).

76.     The new regulation will reduce fiscal risks by diminishing the information
asymmetry between borrowers and lenders and increase transparency. The new regulation
will promote transparency and accountability of the Government’s debt management and public
finance policies. Enhanced subnational liability data will allow for more fact based and accurate
state and municipality credit assessments. The new framework should also promote a greater
payment culture among States and Municipalities by including the information collected by the
credit bureau among the criteria which determine reserve requirements.

Government’s medium term reform agenda

77.      A more transparent accounting and regulatory framework would strengthen
subnational fiscal discipline and improve monitoring and evaluation of intergovernmental
flows. An internalization of spending and revenue-raising decision costs and strengthening of
debt data accuracy would improve subnational fiscal discipline. The establishment of a common
budget classification system in parallel to accounting harmonization would also enhance fiscal
transparency and support standardization across government levels. Fiscal transparency at the
subnational level, including the preparation of medium and long-term budget projections, would
facilitate the identification of longer term fiscal risks related to population aging and support the
establishment of a comprehensive national fiscal risk management strategy.

78.     The Government should define expenditure responsibilities more clearly. Health and
education are the two main areas that present an issue of overlapping responsibilities.
Weaknesses in information and reporting systems make it difficult to clearly separate federal and
state responsibilities and assess whether federal funds have been used effectively. Furthermore,
there is still the need to improve local revenue raising capacity and strengthen the predictability
of intergovernmental transfer rules.


                               VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION
    Risk and Risk Mitigation

79.     Looking ahead, the development outcome of the program is subject to risks, though
moderate and mitigated by the Government’s ongoing commitment and strong ownership
of the supported reforms. A sharp weakening in the economic recovery of the United States
would pose downside risks to Mexico’s growth due to the high degree of integration, and could
affect some program progress. Likewise, sovereign debt and banking sector problems in Europe
could increase global risk aversion, and lead to higher volatility in Mexico’s financial markets.
However, the Government’s record of sound and predictable macroeconomic management,
reflected in their successful response to the 2009 global crisis, and the increased insurance
provided by the international reserve accumulation and a successor IMF Flexible Credit Line
mitigate some of these tail risks. Though the Government has less fiscal flexibility than it had at
the onset of the 2008/2009 crisis, it can engage in limited fiscal easing. The Government’s solid


                                                 27 
 
track record is a testament to their strong commitment to prudent fiscal policies and therefore,
reduces the likelihood of backtracking.

80.    Limited control over the legislative agenda and the upcoming presidential elections
–July 2012– may lead to slower and less progress on the advancement of structural
reforms. In order to obtain congressional approval for legislative reforms, President Felipe
Calderón will need the cooperation of the major opposition parties in the lower house of
Congress. While this has proved challenging throughout the current administration, as
presidential elections draw closer the possibility to construct legislative majorities to support
reform proposals will diminish. As a result, the Government has begun to rely on actions that do
not require legislative approval, such as a number of those supported in this operation.

81.     Deterioration in Mexico’s security situation could lead to some backtracking in
program outcomes. If the security situation degenerates further it could impact fiscal
consolidation, investment and economic growth. Increased competition between the gangs on
the control of drug flows has led to a rise in violence over the past few years. The Government
is strengthening and reorganizing its security forces to contain and reduce the impact of
organized crime in Mexico.


Poverty, Social and Environmental Impacts

82.     The program is expected to have a positive poverty and social impact on the poor
and vulnerable. A Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) carried out by the Bank
(Annex 5) assesses in some detail the poverty and social impacts of policies included in the
budget stability and transparency, natural disaster risk management, and subnational debt
management policy areas. It is expected that the main policies supported by this operation will
protect pro-poor program budgets, contribute to financial inclusion, and improve government
efficiency in natural disaster response.

83.     After a decade of continuous decline, poverty reversed the trend in 2006. Mexico
saw a dramatic decline in poverty between 1996 and 2004 with poverty falling almost 22
percentage points. Income poverty dropped to its lowest point in 2006, at 42.7 percent, before
reversing the 10-year trend. As the effects of the food and fuel prices shocks along with the
financial crisis of 2008 made themselves felt, the incidence of poverty rose. Between 2006 and
2008, poverty increased by five percentage points and, in the next two years rose a further 3.6
points.

84.     The policies in the budget stability and transparency area will likely have a positive
social impact through increased budget transparency, greater ability to protect
government programs, and the promotion of financial inclusion. The establishment of a
single treasury account will increase budget stability and transparency and allow for more
effective budgetary planning. The electronic payment of benefits to the unbanked should
promote access to formal financial sector products and services to a wider section of the
population. Access to financial sector instruments, and in particular access to savings, have the
potential to increase welfare. The establishment of an electronic retail system for public debt,

                                               28 
 
Cetes Directo, is targeting low income inexperienced investors. From the most recent data, it
appears that investors have limited holdings. Though it is unlikely that growth in the number of
investors will have a significant impact on national poverty levels it is providing access to a
reliable and higher yielding savings instrument for a larger segment of the population.

85.     The policies in the natural disaster risk management policy area will likely improve
the Government’s ability to respond to and mitigate the impact of disasters. In so doing, the
DPL will help the Government improve its capacity to protect all of its citizens - including the
most vulnerable- from natural hazards. Mexico’s exposure to natural disasters has broad
implications both for infrastructure costs and socio-economic vulnerability and poverty. Poorer
communities generally face greater exposure and a longer-lasting impact to natural disasters.
While the monetary value of the asset loss for poor households may be less than for wealthier
households, the loss of a fraction of those assets may imply a greater loss in welfare. The
combination of vulnerability to risk and poverty translates into higher and longer impact of
disasters on poorer communities. A differentiated analysis of the type of social expenditures/
programs that are normally affected by the contraction/re-allocation of funding after a disaster
will be conducted, building on a literature review of other relevant cases.

86.     Environmental Aspects. The natural disaster-related prior actions supported by this
operation will likely have a positive effect on the environment. In particular, the new
FONDEN rules of operation will help the Government support and strengthen the following
areas: (a) institutional, legal, and policy frameworks for disaster risk management; (b) risk
identification, assessment, and monitoring capacities by enhancing its institutional framework;
(c) reduction of underlying risk factors such as developing new projects in safe areas; and (d)
improved preparedness for effective response and recovery. These areas of support will
contribute to strengthening institutions related to environmental protection and disaster risk
management. In addition, the operation supports the Government’s efforts in mainstreaming
disaster risk management into a number of key policy areas, such as environmental management.
Measures included in the 2007-2012 National Development Program are aimed at promoting
environmental sustainability, reducing vulnerability to climate change, and improving the
management of the natural disaster fund (FONDEN).

87.     Fiduciary aspects. The public financial management systems at the Federal level are
adequate to support development policy lending in the country. This has been documented in
several World Bank analytical works such as the Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(CFAA), the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), and other analytical work,
including knowledge services products and other DPLs approved in recent years. As envisioned
in the CPS, the Bank has been collaborating with the Government at the central and sub-national
level in strategic areas aimed at modernizing and reforming public finances, and increasing
transparency. This has been supported through a package of different Bank financing instruments
and knowledge services.

88.   In the last decade, the Government has introduced a number of laws and policy
reforms in public finances aimed at improving fiscal responsibility and transparency by
modernizing the budget process and creating a more efficient and transparent fiscal
framework in line with international good practices. The funding from this DPL will support

                                              29 
 
the Federal Expenditure Budget (Presupuesto de Egresos de la Federación, PEF) and,
accordingly, will be subject to provisions of the annual PEF Law, the Federal Budget and Fiscal
Responsibility Law, the Government Accounting Law, and the Manual of Budget Procedures
among others. The PEF is published in a timely manner and is available in the SHCP website for
the current and prior years.18 This set of legal and regulatory arrangements, together with the
country financial management operating systems, provides for sound budget formulation,
execution and internal control arrangements for execution of public expenditures. Other internal
control aspects are ruled by the Federal Public Administration Internal Control Standards.

89.    Although rules and procedures governing the budget, accounting, and public
expenditure laws are clear and comprehensive, and the budget monitoring and control
systems perform well, there remain areas within the public finances where further
advances could be pursued. Developing a long term focus for the budget, including
performance results in the budget formulation process, and engaging the public sector to focus
on results are key priorities. Currently the Government is working towards achieving the
envisioned Public Financial Management (PFM) reforms, including harmonized budget and
accounting financial reporting, modernization of its treasury operations, as well as designing and
implementing an integrated financial information management system at federal level, which is
expected to be implemented during 2012.

90.     As for external oversight, the Federal Supreme Audit Institution conducts, on a
regular basis, a number of audits (i.e. financial, performance and compliance audits) on
federal Government programs. The annual public accounts are prepared and sent to Congress
within four months of the end of each fiscal year. The external audit of these accounts is
undertaken by the Auditor General’s office and submitted to the legislature fourteen months after
the end of each fiscal year in accordance with national legislation. Audit reports are
comprehensive and there is a system in place to follow up on audit findings and
recommendations, in coordination with the Ministry of Civil Service (Secretaria de la Función
Pública, SFP). The results of audits by the Auditor General’s office are made public in the
Annual Audit Report on the Federal Public Accounts. Recent amendments to the Federal
Constitution and a new Law on Supreme Auditing and Accountability have contributed to the
overall strengthening of country fiscal transparency and accountability.

91.     The current Government has the objective to align public procurement more closely
with economic expenditure policy, aimed at producing value for money, ensuring transparency,
economy and efficiency, while improving the overall quality of the goods and services. In
addition, operational changes as well as amendments to the legal and regulatory framework
advanced in 2009 and 2010 have taken several important steps towards addressing the issues
identified in previous World Bank assessments of the federal procurement system in Mexico
(200719, 201020, and 201121). As envisioned in the Country Procurement Strategy, the World

92.    Disbursement and Auditing. The flow of fund arrangements for this operation will
be those customarily observed in DPLs for Mexico, as per long-standing agreements with
the Government. The SHCP has informed the Bank that Banco del Ahorro Nacional y Servicios
Financieros (BANSEFI) will be the financial agent of the Borrower with regard to this DPL.22
Under this arrangement, upon effectiveness and compliance with any withdrawal tranche release
conditions, the Bank would deposit the single tranche disbursement to a designated account of
the financial agent in US Dollars for subsequent credit to an account of the National Treasury
(SHCP/Tesorería de la Federación, TESOFE) in Banco de Mexico (BANXICO) used for
budgeted expenditures. Based on the review of the 2010 audit reports of the financial agent and
the extensive experience between the Bank and the financial agent regarding funds flow from
Bank-financed projects, there is no evidence that the banking control environment into which the
DPL proceeds would flow is other than adequate. If requested by the Bank, the SHCP would
provide the Bank with a written confirmation of the described transaction.

93.    Based on the assessment of the borrower’s current PFM and the conclusion that the
fiduciary arrangements for this financing are adequate, the Bank will not require an audit of
the designated account of the financial agent, and no additional fiduciary arrangements are
considered necessary at this time.

              TRANSLATION OF THE LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY

ROBERT ZOELLICK
President
World Bank

Dear Mr. Zoellick:

In the current global economic environment, characterized by negative shocks to output and
employment caused by the international financial crisis, commodity price volatility and increased
frequency and intensity of natural disasters, there is a need to adequately tackle uncertainty and
macroeconomic risks affecting public finances. As a result, the Government of Mexico has
implemented a strategy to confront various sources of fiscal risk.

Comprehensive Fiscal Risk Management Strategy

Mexico’s fiscal risk management strategy is based on a comprehensive approach. On the one
hand, fiscal and budgetary discipline has been maintained over the past few years, increasing the
country’s resistance to macroeconomic shocks. On the other hand, the Government has
continued with a prudent monetary policy, supporting price stability and generating investment
confidence. Prudent fiscal and monetary policy management has been enhanced through
proactive public debt management, Treasury management, natural disaster risk management and
subnational debt management, among others.

Public Debt Management

Over the last few years, the Government has aimed to deepen the domestic debt market, while
extending maturities. As a result, the current financing needs of the Federal Government are
largely met in the local debt market, while the average maturity of public debt has been
successfully lengthened. An improved public debt profile has reduced public finance
vulnerability to international capital market volatility. At the same time, and as part of an
ambitious financial inclusion strategy, the Government launched Cetes Directo, a program
encouraging saving for retail investors through the direct purchase of government securities via
an internet portal. Due to the significant role of oil income in public revenue and oil price
volatility, the Government continues using price hedging instruments, as well as accumulating
resources in the oil stabilization funds.

Treasury management

In recent years, the Government has put in place measures aimed at improving the efficiency of
the Federal Treasury (TESOFE). Among the recently implemented measures are the
improvement of TESOFE’s internal processes, as well as the coordination and centralization of
electronic payments between TESOFE and the various Federal Government agencies. Greater
cash management efficiency strengthens public finances as a whole. The implemented measures
also promote access to formal financial sector products and services to a larger segment of the



                                               35 
 
population through the electronic payment of government payroll, pensions, and cash-transfer
programs.

Natural Disaster Risk Management

The Government has recently made significant progress in the design and adoption of an
institutional framework to deal with the fiscal implications of natural disasters. In addition to
allocating budget resources in a natural disaster management fund, the Government recently
strengthened its natural disaster risk management strategy through the categorization of risks and
the use of more adequate risk management instruments. In particular, the Government has
purchased an insurance to cover high frequency-low cost events (stop-loss insurance) and issued
a parametric bond to cover low frequency-high costs events (CAT-Bond). Furthermore, the
National Fund for Natural Disasters (FONDEN) recently issued new rules of operation, which
promote risk prevention and efficient reconstruction.

Subnational Debt Management

Even if subnational debt is at an adequate level and does not represent a systemic risk, the
Government has enhanced the financial system’s regulatory framework to prevent subnational
financing risks and maintain the soundness of the system. In particular, prudential regulations
regarding commercial bank financing to States and municipalities were strengthened, by
discouraging excessive subnational borrowing through greater market discipline.

Relationship Mexico-World Bank

The Government and the World Bank maintain a close working relationship. Mexico values the
World Bank’s financial and knowledge services. As a result, we welcome the Bank’s recognition
of the actions we have undertaken to strengthen fiscal risk management, a set of actions framed
in two axes of the National Development Plan 2007-2012:"Competitive Economy and Job
Creation? and "Equal Opportunities". Pursuant to the above, let me express the Ministry of
Finance and Public Credit’s support of this loan, which recognizes implemented fiscal risk
management policy actions, such as those described above.

We hope that this new operation between the World Bank and the Government of Mexico will
strengthen our bilateral relationship, facilitate the exchange of experiences related to fiscal risk
management, and improve our institutional capacity to address these risks.

Thank you in advance for your attention, and for the opportunity to reiterate my highest
consideration.


                                                      Yours Sincerely,

IMF Executive Board Completes Review of Mexico’s Performance Under the Flexible
Credit Line

Press Release No. 11/480
December 22, 2011

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed on December 21, 2011,
its review of Mexico’s qualification for the arrangement under the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) and
reaffirmed Mexico’s continued qualification to access FCL resources. The Mexican authorities
have indicated that they intend to continue treating the arrangement as precautionary.
The two year arrangement for Mexico for SDR 47.292 billion (about US$73 billion), approved in
January 10, 2011 (see Press Release No. 11/4), was the first under the reforms to the FCL
approved in August 30, 2010 (see Press Release No. 10/321).
Following the Executive Board discussion of Mexico, Mr. David Lipton, First Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chairman of the Board, made the following statement:
“The Flexible Credit Line (FCL) arrangement for Mexico, approved a year ago in a context of
heightened risks to the global economic outlook, has played an important role in supporting the
authorities’ overall macroeconomic strategy, providing an insurance against global tail risks and
bolstering market confidence. Today, the Executive Board reaffirmed that Mexico continues to
meet the qualification criteria for access to FCL resources.
“Mexico’s rapid rebound from the global crisis and the resilience of economic activity in recent
months bear witness to Mexico’s sound fundamentals and skillful policy management. The strong
policy track record and frameworks, including a balanced-budget rule, a credible inflation
targeting regime, and prudent financial oversight, have underpinned sound public and private
balance sheets.
“The authorities are committed to rebuilding policy buffers gradually in light of heightened global
risks. Fiscal consolidation and supportive monetary policy are poised to be maintained, while the
increase in external buffers is being complemented by the FCL arrangement. The floating
exchange rate regime will continue to play a key role in buffering external shocks.
“Downside risks to Mexico’s near-term outlook arise from unsettled global growth prospects and
the turbulence in international financial markets. However, Mexico retains policy space to contain
the potential fallout from external shocks, supported by the FCL arrangement, and the
authorities remain committed to the rules-based macroeconomic framework and to adjust
policies as needed,? Mr. Lipton said.

                                              Annex 4.a.: Budget Stability and Transparency

94.     Prudent fiscal policies and improved public liability management have reduced
expenditure volatility. Since 2006, fiscal policy has been guided by the balanced budget rule
and medium-term budgetary framework imbedded in the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL). The
FRL institutionalized Government efforts to contain fiscal deficits and stabilize debt levels,
while supporting accountability and transparency in the annual budget process. In addition to the
establishment of a balanced budget rule, the law also introduced a formula for calculating the oil
price in budget projections, and established four excess oil-revenue stabilization funds. The
stabilization funds, in combination with the Government’s hedging program23, moderate inter-
annual budget deviations produced by sharp swings in oil prices and/or other external shocks.
The current balanced budget rule has served well to build credibility.

95.     Risk management measures are essential to minimize the impact of shocks on
revenue and expenditure. Revenue is vulnerable to economic downturns and sharp swings in
the oil price, as oil receipts account for approximately one-third of federal income. Government
outlays are susceptible to unexpected macroeconomic fiscal risks arising from debt service
increases due to interest rate and/or exchange rate movements, and other fiscal risks such as
natural disasters and banking sector crises. As the FRL does not allow for a deviation in the
overall budget balance, revenue reductions or specific program expenditure increases must be
offset by decreases elsewhere or result in the loss of credibility associated with a budget
amendment. As a result, during the recent financial crisis the Government had to balance the
objectives of supporting economic activity and maintaining fiscal credibility. Mexico’s
demonstrated commitment to fiscal consolidation reinforced the country’s positive
macroeconomic performance and was an important indicator for financial markets and
international credit rating agencies.

96.     Mexico’s oil-revenue stabilization funds and the Government’s hedging program
protect public spending by establishing a fiscal buffer. Excess revenue relative to budgeted
amounts is accumulated among four stabilization funds—an Oil Stabilization Fund (40 percent),
a PEMEX Investment Fund (25 percent), a State Stabilization Fund (25 percent) and a State
Infrastructure Fund (10 percent). If in any year total revenues are less than budgeted as a result
of lower oil prices or exchange rate effects, the oil stabilization fund may transfer resources to
the budget or to Pemex to cover the shortfall. However, caps of 1.5 percent of GDP on the
accumulation of resources in the stabilization funds weaken their ability to act as fiscal buffers
and to countervail the pro-cyclicality of the balanced budget rule.24 In 2010-2012, the
Government temporarily lifted the caps on the accumulation to promote savings. A permanent
elimination of these caps would be appropriate.



                                                            
23
   Authorities hedge from oil price volatility by using resources from the oil stabilization fund to purchase put options. The strike
price of the options is close to the oil price that would ensure the budgeted amount of oil-related revenues needed to finance
public expenditures (for 2011 US$63 a barrel). This avoids the need to reduce planned spending if the price of exported oil were
to fall below the budgeted price.
24
   Booming oil revenues during 2003–08 underwrote average annual growth in real primary spending of 7 percent as savings in
oil stabilization funds were capped. 

                                                                   40 
 
97.     A strengthened public debt profile limits public finance vulnerability to short-term
macroeconomic fiscal risks. The substitution of external for domestic public sector debt, and
the phase out of currency-linked and increase in fixed rate debt instruments have been integral to
Mexico’s debt management program, and reduced vulnerabilities associated with exchange and
interest rate movements. The lengthening of the average maturity of local Government bonds, to
7 years in 2011 from 1.5 in 2000, has reduced financing risk and broadened the investor base. In
October 2010, the Government sold US$1 billion in bonds with maturity of 100 years, the first of
its kind in Latin America.

98.     In 2010 the Government began using bond syndications in order to deepen the
domestic debt market, and as a growing alternative to bank funding and international
capital markets. Syndication is different from a normal bond auction in that banks are employed
to underwrite the issue and encourage investor demand. This strategy guarantees the sale of a
larger amount of peso-denominated bonds upfront, which promotes liquidity in the bond market,
accelerates the establishment of domestic benchmark bonds, expands the investor base, and
boosts eligibility in a number of fixed income indices. In October 2010 Mexico became the first
Latin American country to be incorporated in Citigroup’s World Government Bond Index
(WGBI).25 The country’s admission reflects successful macroeconomic policies and
advancements in the performance of the local debt market. Within the 5 months following
Mexico’s admission, foreign investment in government bonds had increased by more than 11
percent.


                                                            
25
   Mexican local markets have also been incorporated in the most important global fixed income indexes: JP Morgan Broad Index
(January 2003), Merrill Lynch Global Broad Market Plus Index (June 2003), and Lehman Global Aggregate Index (January
2005).
 
 

                                                                                         41 
 
99.     The launching of Cetes Directo, a program promoting the direct purchase of
government securities by retail investors advances the Government’s effort to broaden the
investor base. The traditional method for issuing government debt is through auctions open just
for wholesale investors and financial intermediaries. Retail debt gives small investors the
opportunity to buy government securities at a lower cost without intermediaries, while
diversifying the source of government funding. The incorporation of a large, diversified and
largely untapped investor base could over time lower the cost of public sector borrowing and
reduce capital flow volatility.     Furthermore, the program promotes transparency and
accountability of the Government’s debt management policies.

100. Retail debt programs and their contribution as a percent of total government debt
vary widely worldwide. A number of countries have instituted retail debt programs, where
public securities are sold directly to individual investors, and whose main aim is to offer
investors low cost alternatives while diversifying the country’s investor base. However, retail
debt programs often vary in secondary objectives, organizational setup, products offered, and
distribution channels. Despite impressive retail investor growth in a number of countries, the
value of retail debt as a percent of total government debt varies significantly depending on the
country. While in a number of European countries the percentage is quite high: Ireland (14.9),
Italy (20.2), Portugal (15.9), and the U.K. (13.10), in others countries the contribution of retail
debt is significantly smaller: Canada (4.1), Hungary (4.5), South Africa (.55), Brazil (.17) and
the U.S. (2.45). For Cetes Directo to reach the same level as Brazil, the retail investor platform
would need an increase of approximately 5.6 billion pesos (US$ 400 million).26

101. The Brazilian retail debt program, Tesouro Direto, reveals the potential of Cetes
Directo. The Tesouro Direto program had approximately 5,900 investors in year one (by end
December 2002), with the number increasing dramatically in the second year to 21,000 investors.
Expansion was not as remarkable in the following years but still strong, reaching 145,000
investors by the end of 2008 (Tesouro do Brasil, 2011). Growth slowed in the aftermath of the
financial crisis but was still in the 20 percent range for 2009 and 2010. Preliminary evidence
from 2011 shows a slight increase in growth, with the number of investors amounting to just
under 264,000.

102. Savings through Cetes Directo provides individuals with an additional instrument
against temporary shocks to income by supporting consumption smoothing. One of the
objectives of Cetes Directo is to foster a culture of savings and provide a secure investment for
individuals with a low capacity to manage risk. The Government recently reduced further
barriers to entry by instituting a new and easier method for opening a Cetes account for low
transaction value accounts in the hopes of further democratizing access.

104. The Single Treasury Account (STA) is a unified structure of government bank
accounts that provides a consolidated view of government cash resources. The STA is
managed by the Treasury of the Federation (TESOFE, by its Spanish acronym), a unit of the
Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP). The establishment of a STA improves cash
management and control, lowers borrowing costs, and facilitates fiscal and monetary policy
coordination. As presented in the flow chart below, the overall objective of the STA is to
achieve operational efficiency in the administration of the Federal Government’s funds through a
centralized cash management system.

                                                                     Operational Efficiency

105. Before the establishment of a STA, Federal Government funds were managed in
segregated banking accounts. During 2007, TESOFE initiated a strategic plan for the
modernization of the Government’s banking arrangements, including the preparation of a cross-
country best practices benchmark analysis, and a diagnostic of the functions, processes and
systems used by TESOFE in its operations. As a result of the assessment, four main areas were
determined for TESOFE’s strategic modernization plan: (i) Development of a STA system, (ii)
Creation of an accounting system for the management of Federal Government funds, (iii)
Certification of TESOFE’s processes according to the ISO-9001:2008 methodology, and (iv)
Issuance of a new regulatory framework for TESOFE.

106. TESOFE’s legal framework was modified as part of the modernization process. The
main regulatory modifications include:
 Modification of Article 51 of the Ley Federal de Presupuesto y Responsabilidad Hacendaria
   (the Federal Budget and Fiscal Responsibility Law - LFPRH) on October 1, 2007, in order to
   establish: (i) TESOFE’s responsibility for the collection and payment of all Federal public
   administration ministries (“Dependencias?, according to the Spanish definition included in
   the LFRPH), (ii) a Single Treasury Account; obligatory for “Dependencias? and Federal
   Public Parastatal Entities (“Entidades?, according to the Spanish definition included in the
   LFRPH).27

                                                            
27
     For the purposes of this document, “Dependencias? and “Entidades? will be identified as Public Entities.

                                                                              43 
 
       SHCP’s issuance of guidelines for the operation of the STA28 on December 24, 2009,
        including procedures for opening bank accounts in the name of TESOFE, and in exceptional
        cases, in the name of Public Entities.29
       Regulation establishing that all Public Entities adopt electronic payment programs through
        the STA by December 2012, as published in the official gazette on December 7, 2010 and
        included in the 2011 Budget Law of Expenditures of the Federal Government (Ley del
        Presupuesto de Egresos de la Federación.- LPEF).

        (1) Federal Government’s taxes are deposited into 18 commercial banking accounts in
            TESOFE’s name.
        (2) TESOFE transfers the funds into its account at the Central Bank (Banco de Mexico).
        (3) As per instructions by the public entities, TESOFE makes all payments to the final
            beneficiaries through the Central Bank SPEI (Sistema de Pagos Electrónicos
            Interbancarios) system.30
        (4) In exceptional cases TESOFE allows public entities to maintain their own bank accounts
            for beneficiary payments.

107. Since establishment of the STA, several advances have been made:
 Sixty-eight percent of funds are now collected through the STA. Nearly all the
   “Dependencias? are integrated in the STA system, while transactions by state-owned
   enterprises (“Entidades?), accounting for 29 percent of total funds, are not yet included.
 In the case of payments, the situation is similar, with Entidades still not included in the STA
   system, though accounting for 25 percent of the total amount of expenditure.

108. Advancements in the implementation of the STA system have had a considerable
impact on TESOFE’s operational capacity. By 2010 more than 70 percent of the public

                                                                             44 
 
budget was channeled through the STA system. On the collection side, the number of operations
has increased from 4.6 million in 2007 to 29 million in 2010, and on the payments side from 1.6
million to 15 million transactions over the same timeframe. Since initial implementation, the
new scheme has generated savings for the Federal Government of US$139 million. In order to
further strengthen its operational capacity, TESOFE undertook the following actions:
     Establishment of 4 new systems for collection control.
     Inclusion of 6 new modules into the SIAFF system (Sistema Integral de Información
        Financiera- Integrated Financial Information System), used to process payments.
     Improvement of TESOFE’s accounting system31, including the facilitation of (i)
        automated reconciliation of operations with commercial banking institutions, (ii)
        automatic on-line accounting registration of operations according to a pre-defined chart
        of accounts, (iii) control of operations including several levels of sub-accounts, (iv)
        issuance of automatic financial reports, and (v) monitoring of activities performed in the
        system.

109. Additional steps in TESOFE’s modernization plan include the certification of its
processes according to the following standards issued by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO): ISO-9001:2008, which provides a set of standardized requirements for
quality management systems.32 In 2011 TESOFE certified 27 processes, out of which 12 belong
to the Under-Treasury of Operations (Subtesoreria de Operación), 7 to the Under-Treasury of
Accounting and Operational Control (Subtesoreria de Contabilidad y Control Operativo), 4 to
the Funds and Securities Oversight Unit (Unidad de Vigilancia de Fondos y Valores), 3 to the
Legal Procedures General Directorate (Dirección General de Procedimientos Legales), and 1 to
the Administrative Coordination Unit (Coordinación Administrativa). Overall, the certification
program has improved operational process transparency, process automation, business
continuity, and information security.

110. As noted earlier, TESOFE will continue the roll out of the STA system through
2012. The Government established in the 2011 LPEF that all Dependencias and Entidades
should liaise with the SHCP to prepare and implement working programs to complete the roll out
of the STA system by August 2012, through the inclusion of the following operations:
     Revenue collected by the Entidades, and other contributions directly collected by
        Entidades and Dependencias, such as Foreign Trade Contributions (3 percent of total
        funds), must be incorporated into the STA system.
     Expenditures incurred by the Entidades, and Entidades and Dependencias, such as
        government employee payroll33, government program beneficiary payments, pension
        funds, public trust funds, and ministration agreements34 must continue to be incorporated
        into the STA system. The 2012 budget also added the incorporation of federal
        government pension payments to IMSS and ISSSTE to the STA.
                                                            
31
    SICOFE (Sistema Integral de Contabilidad de Fondos Federales.- Integrated Accounting System for Federal Funds)
32
    On October 27, 2011 the firm SGS, determined that TESOFE complied with the ISO 9001-2008 quality guidelines. 
33
    As of July 2011 the employees of 895 sector public entities (including Dependencias and Entidades) had already been included
into the STA system (i.e. receive their payroll through the STA), out of a total of 1,109 entities. The remaining 214 entities will
be incorporated gradually until August 2012, as established by the Law.
34
    A Ministration agreement is a mechanism established in Article 46 of the LFPRH which allows Dependencias and Entidades,
which are facing extraordinary resource needs, to request an advance of funds to the SHCP in excess of its approved budget,
which is supposed to be regularized in its regular budget the following fiscal year.

                                                               45 
 
111.          Expected benefits of the STA system include:
             Reduction of financial costs associated with the management of multiple bank accounts.
             Maximization of the opportunity cost of cash management.
             Promotion of financial sector penetration through the incorporation in the banking system
              of all Federal Government payment beneficiaries, such as providers of goods and
              services, government program beneficiaries, and government employees, among others.
             Oversight improvement of Federal Government Program beneficiaries (such as
              Oportunidades, Procampo, etc.)
             Efficient payment mechanism facilitation.
             Enhancement of resource flow transparency.
             Improvement of operational control during budget execution.
             Strengthened negotiating position with commercial banks.

112. A key element of TESOFE’s modernization plan is the issuance of a draft Treasury
Law reflecting the operational, technical and institutional changes.35 The draft Law has
already been elaborated; however the completion of this task during the current administration is
not certain, as it depends on political factors outside the control of TESOFE. The draft Law has
the following features:
     It is based on international best practices, and aims to improve transparency and
        efficiency in the financial management of government funds. It is more concise than the
        previous Law, with 64 versus 134 articles.
     It is aligned with all the legal requirements related to treasury functions that have been
        issued in different laws (e.g. LPEF, LFPRH, and Official Gazette, among others) after its
        latest modification in 2007.




                                                            
35
  The latest version of the Treasury Law was issued in December 1985, and modified on four occasions: 1995, 1998, 2000 and
2007.

                                                               46 
 
                                                   Annex 4.c.: Natural Disaster-Related Fiscal Risk

113. Natural disaster risk is high in Mexico. Mexico is highly vulnerable to a number of
natural hazards, with approximately 41 percent of Mexico’s territory and 31 percent of its
population exposed to hurricanes, storms, floods, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. In
economic terms, this translates into 30 percent of GDP at risk from three or more hazards and 71
percent at risk from two or more hazards. Population growth and increased concentration of
physical assets in highly exposed areas has led to increased vulnerability to adverse events, while
unplanned and unregulated land use, lack of environmental controls and poor application of
building standards exacerbates asset losses. Climate change will likely increase the number and
frequency of hydro-meteorological hazards in Mexico.

114. Natural disasters often lead to sudden, largely non-budgeted fiscal pressures for
emergency relief and reconstruction activities. In particular, large catastrophic risks pose a
major challenge for public finances and for debt sustainability. Natural disasters impact
budgeted expenditure and revenue flows. Expenditures are impacted through short term
pressures for immediate disaster relief activities and in the medium to long-term through
government financed reconstruction and improvement activities. The impact on revenue depends
on the macroeconomic dynamics following the shock and the structure of public revenue sources
(i.e. income tax, property tax, oil revenue, etc).

115. The 2011 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction (ERN) estimated
contingent liabilities of natural hazards in Mexico. The value at risk is computed by
multiplying the value of assets exposed (infrastructure under Government responsibility) by the
probability of a disaster event. According to the report, the annual expected loss from
earthquakes is US$157 million and US$646 from hurricanes. Overall, the annual expected loss
from natural disasters is US$803 million.

source and are usually used to cover high frequency-low cost events. Loss financing resources,
such as contingent credit lines, emergency loans, and insurance products provide ex-post
financing. Low frequency-high cost disasters are best addressed through risk transfer
instruments such as CAT bonds and catastrophic risk insurance. A comprehensive assessment of
a country’s fiscal exposure to natural disasters can identify the optimal combination of risk
retention, contingent financing and risk transfer mechanisms to reduce public finance
vulnerability. Mexico is gradually moving from an ex-post response to natural disasters to an ex-
ante preparedness approach.

117. The Federal Government has pursued an integrated approach to disaster risk
management, involving the assessment, prevention, and transfer of fiscal risks. The current
risk financing strategy includes a variety of financing components, ranging from exceptional
budget financing and prevention through build-back-better schemes to private risk transfer
instruments such as specific sector insurance policies, reinsurance and catastrophe bonds (see
Figure 4). Assessment of the Federal Government’s infrastructure at risk has facilitated the
transfer of some of Mexico’s low frequency-high cost natural disaster risk through a number of
insurance products described below.

118. The National Fund for Natural Disasters (FONDEN), a key player in Mexico’s
disaster risk management strategy, was established in 1996 to support natural disaster
emergency response and reconstruction. FONDEN protects the Mexican population (through
immediate relief response), its public assets (through reconstruction financing), and (uninsured)
low-income housing from disasters that exceed Federal and State governments and agencies
financial response capacity. It is jointly managed by the Ministry of Interior (SEGOB) and the
Ministry of Finance (SHCP) and uses various instruments to support federal and state
governments and federal agencies response to natural disasters, including reserve funds and risk
transfer solutions.

119. FONDEN, a multi-annual trust fund, receives an annual budget allocation to assure
the availability of at least 0.4 percent of total programmable public expenditure at the
beginning of each fiscal year. As there is variability in disaster intensity and occurrence from
year to year, FONDEN manages its resources through a multi-annual Trust Fund, which
eliminates the need to spend the full allocation each year, thus creating a stabilization
mechanism. Although this increases the flexibility of FONDEN resources, the amount available
for recovery has proven inadequate to cover growing financial needs, as in reality the annual
budget allocation raising the available resources in the fund to 0.4 percent of total programmable
public expenditure at the beginning of each budget year has de-facto become a cap on the
accumulation of resources. If the resources allocated to FONDEN are exhausted or prove
insufficient during periods of high disaster activity (such as 2010), Article 19 of the Federal
Budget allows for exceptional budget financing.

120. In 2006, the Government issued a US$450 million risk transfer instrument (CatMex)
to transfer some of Mexico’s earthquake risk to the international capital markets. CatMex


                                               48 
 
provided protection for three years against earthquakes in specific zones of the Mexican territory
by combining parametric reinsurance policy (US$290 million) and catastrophe bond coverage
(US$160 million). After the CatMex matured in 2009, Mexico further diversified its coverage
by pooling multiple risks in multiple regions. In October 2009, it issued a multi-peril three year
(2009-2012) Cat bond using the World Bank’s newly established MultiCat Program, which
enables the pooling of perils across multiple regions to reduce insurance costs. The MultiCat
bond protects against hurricanes and earthquakes of a predetermined magnitude and covers two
of the most exposed zones in the Pacific Coast and one in the Atlantic Coast.

121. In 2011, FONDEN reformed its operating rules to more efficiently allocate fund
resources by allowing Federal and State Governments to independently finance and
manage reconstruction activities. Previously, Federal and State contributions were placed in a
common financial vehicle from which all expenditures were paid once both entities had
committed the necessary funds. This caused reconstruction delays since States often had
difficulties in providing funding. Under the new scheme, the federal government is responsible
for the full reconstruction of damaged federal infrastructure and for fifty percent of the affected
State infrastructure, with the State responsible for the remaining half. It is hoped that the new
rules will improve local government risk management by encouraging vulnerability reduction
and risk financing mechanisms at the local level, since there are incentives for the States to
independently insure and improve local infrastructure. Additional improvements in the rules
include an increase in the allocation of funds for preventative activities and measures through the
merging of the two existing preventive funds (FIPREDEN and FOPREDEN). This will increase
financial support for State level preventative projects and the development of risk financing and
transfer mechanisms at the local level. The new rules and guidelines also strengthen
transparency, efficiency and effectiveness of federal spending.

122. The new rules of operations allow FONDEN to reduce the average time between the
request and the allocation of reconstruction funds. Based on existing FONDEN indicators
the average time between a request and fund allocation in 2010 was 45 days.36 However, it is
important to highlight that the time between the request and allocation of reconstruction funds is
also a function of the type and size of the natural disaster event. Large floods, like those that
occurred in 2010, delay damage assessments and in turn slow down the allocation process. The
reform of the rules of operation significantly simplify FONDEN procedures and speed up the
process of reconstruction funds allocation. According to FONDEN, the time between request and
allocation of funds should decrease to 28 days by December 2012.
            
123. The separation of responsibilities between the Federal and the State government for
the reconstruction of State-level infrastructure will allow for better management of the
reconstruction process. Under the new scheme, the States will be held accountable for the
reconstruction of their own infrastructure. Moreover, the reconstruction of the fifty percent of
State infrastructure managed by the federal government will face less delay. Overall, the new
scheme will improve reconstruction efficiency. Higher efficiency should be reflected by a
reduction in the reconstruction period. An indicator that is used by the FONDEN General
Directorate to measure the progress on reconstruction programs is the percentage of programs

closed during a given fiscal year with respect to the number of programs open at the beginning of
the same fiscal year. In 2010 this percentage was 26 percent. As a result of the new co-sharing
scheme, it is expected that the percentage will increase to 35 percent by December 2012.

124. In June 2011 the Federal Government successfully concluded the placement in the
reinsurance market of a stop-loss insurance against catastrophic events. The reinsurance is
triggered when the resources allocated to FONDEN (MX12.5 billion or US$1 billion) result
insufficient to pay the costs associated with reconstruction. The insurance would provide up to
MXN4.8 billion (US$390 million) to finance reconstruction without the need to allocate
extraordinary resources from the budget or cut funds assigned to other important programs.

125. In an effort to protect FONDEN resources and promote risk sharing, FONDEN
regulation is encouraging local governments to develop a comprehensive risk management
strategy. The transfer of natural disaster risk through specific sector and/or local Government
insurance policies would further decrease disaster fiscal risks on the federal Government. A
subordinate level insurance would ensure an additional layer of protection before the release of
FONDEN reconstruction resources. Several federal agencies such as the CONAGUA37
(responsible for the water, sanitation, and hydraulic infrastructure at federal level), SEP38

(responsible for public schools and educational institutions), and the Ministry of Health have
already contracted insurance as a first layer of protection against disasters. FONDEN is also
promoting the establishment of local disaster funds, in order to further decentralize natural
disaster emergency response and reconstruction financing, and encourage States to take more
responsibility for their infrastructure. Ultimately, FONDEN is aiming towards a decentralized
disaster risk management system where local governments have strong incentives to invest in
risk reduction, moving away from the current system whereby the federal government finances
most of the reconstruction.

126. Moving forward more effort on prevention is needed at the three levels of
Government to reduce the fiscal and human costs of natural disasters. Until now, limited
resources have been applied through FOPREDEN, with the vast majority of budget allocations
used for post-disaster reconstruction. However, increased attention is being placed on ensuring
that reconstruction activities ‘build back better’, reducing the exposure of public assets to
disaster risks. Better urban planning and settlement regulation, improved and enforced
construction codes, and increased public education and awareness would also reduce the costs of
natural disasters.

127.     Mexico’s federalism is characterized by high vertical fiscal imbalances. Progressive
revenue centralization at the federal government level, coupled with expenditure decentralization
at the subnational level has resulted in a high dependence on federal transfers and low tax effort
by subnational governments. Transfers from the federal government represent the largest source
of funds for subnational governments at approximately 82 percent of total revenue, and are made
up of tax revenue shares (participaciones)39 representing about 32 percent of revenue, and
expenditure-specific or earmarked grants (aportaciones) at 50 percent of revenue. Subnational
governments raise approximately 10 percent from internal sources, 4.4 percent from financing
and the remainder from other sources.40 Though effective development and poverty alleviation
often hinge on improved subnational growth and service delivery, fiscal decentralization can
weigh on a government’s budgetary balances and create significant contingent liabilities for the
Federal government, impact growth and jeopardize sovereign ratings.

128. Subnational government revenue was hard hit by the 2008 crisis. Participaciones
experienced a 16 percent drop in 2009, due to the fall in economic activity and a significant drop
in oil prices. The federal government addressed the shortfall by transferring resources from the
FEIEF (Fondo de Estabilización de los Ingresos de las Entidades Federativas) to the States and
Municipalities through a securitization of future flows to the FEIEF.41 42 As reflected in Figure 1,
the surge in borrowing as of 2009, led to a significant increase in subnational debt, even
excluding FEIEF resources. Though the stock of subnational debt in Mexico is only 2.5 percent
of GDP, it amounts to 72 percent of annual non-earmarked transfers (participaciones).

129. In 2009, the Government modified bank prudential regulations, which facilitated
access to finance for subnational entities. The modification of bank prudential regulations
encouraged short-term borrowing. While long term borrowing remained regulated by a quasi-
market mechanism, which required approval by state legislators, registration with the federal
government, and often counted on participaciones as collateral, rules on short-term borrowing
were substantially eased. In particular, short-term debt was exempted from a higher risk rating
and the need to establish prudential reserves.43 As a consequence, short-term debt increased
significantly during the last two years (see Figure 2). The rapid accumulation of short-term
liabilities resulted in unsustainable debt levels and fiscal problems in some States.

   The data was obtained from INEGI, which compiles data from the states and municipalities, and includes 2009 and 2010
revenue flows.
41
   The Federal Government established the FEIEF in 2005. As the resources in the Fund (22 billion pesos) were insufficient to
address the 2009 participaciones shortfall (of around 70 billion pesos), the Government designed a financial scheme to securitize
future flows of the FEIEF, leading to commercial and development bank’s lending 40 billion FEIEF collateralized pesos to
subnational governments. The additional resources cushioned the fall in revenue, with participaciones amounting to only 2
percent below budget expectations. FEIEF resources are not included in the stock of subnational debt displayed in Figure 1.
42
   The Mexican Constitution allows subnational government borrowing in domestic currency and from Mexican residents only
and restricts the use of funds obtained from borrowings to productive investments.
43
   State legislatures have the right to define what constitutes debt and thus what needs to be approved by their local Congress.
Most states do not consider liabilities whose maturity is less than a year as debt.

130. Short-term debt was not always included in the federal debt registry resulting in
growing discrepancies between reported and actual subnational debt.44 According to the
ministry of Finance, States had 363 million pesos of debt of which only 314 million pesos were
registered with the federal government.45 The difference between these figures suggests a
relevant amount of short-term debt additionally accumulated and unaccounted for in the
subnational debt registry. The States with the highest discrepancy, in terms of percent of
unregistered debt, are Coahuila, Chihuahua, Michoacán, Tabasco and Zacatecas (see Table 2).
The financial distress of the state of Coahuila in 2011 took the authorities and market

   The definition of short-term debt in terms of maturity–less than 180 days–is based on the banking prudential regulation. State
public debt laws contain different definitions for short-term credits from financial intermediaries such as credits that have to be
paid before the end of the fiscal year or before the end of the term of the current administration.

participants by surprise, in part because there was misreporting and underreporting of the State’s
debt and possibly fraud, and also because these loans were not considered when monitoring loan
concentration.

131. An incomplete picture of subnational entities liability position heightened fiscal
risks and raised questions regarding the existing borrowing framework. Credit ratings were
used by bank regulators to assign capital risk weightings and prudential reserves for bank loans
to subnational governments. This regulatory framework encouraged states and larger
municipalities to obtain credit ratings, by one of the four approved rating agencies in Mexico—
Standard and Poor’s, Fitch, Moody’s and HR Ratings. However, the over dependence on rating
agencies and relaxing of regulations concerning short-term debt reduced due diligence by some
financial institutions, led to high lending concentrations, and heightened fiscal risks.

132. In September 2011, the Government modified banking regulation linking prudential
reserve requirements for lending to subnational entities to a comprehensive set of
indicators. As a result, reserve provisioning should more closely track the portfolio quality of
each institution. The structure of the new approach is largely based on Basel II risk models, and
incorporates multiple indicators evaluating willingness and ability to pay based on fiscal and
debt management ratios and on economic performance trends (see Table 1). The new credit risk
assessment shifts the responsibility for risk evaluation to the financial institutions providing
credit. The new regulation will reintroduce prudential reserve requirements on short-term debt
and place a high penalty on banks that do not adhere to the new rules. Unregistered loans will be
automatically risk-weighted at 150 percent.

133. The new regulation will reduce the demand and stock of short-term debt, gradually
eliminate the level of unregistered debt and strengthen bank due diligence. The
reintroduction of prudential reserve requirements for short-term debt will reduce subnational
short term debt to more reasonable levels. The new credit assessment will require banks closer
engagement in the due diligence process and, in turn, demand more transparency from
subnational governments. The authorities anticipate that the new system will provide a better

                                                                  54 
 
estimate of the probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default, which should
more closely link reserve requirements with banks portfolio quality. It is expected that the new
regulation will increase transparency and that the share of registered-to-actual debt will increase
from 86.5 percent to 93 percent by end of December 2012. Over the medium term, we expect
the share of registered debt to be very close to the total amount of subnational debt (>95 percent).

134. The new regulation will reduce fiscal risks by diminishing the information
asymmetry between borrowers and lenders and increasing transparency. The new
regulation will promote transparency and accountability of the Government’s debt management
and public finance policies. Enhanced subnational liability data will allow for more fact based
and accurate state and municipality credit assessments. The new framework should also promote
a greater payment culture among States and Municipalities by including the information
collected by the credit bureau among the criteria which determine reserve requirements.

Remaining Challenges

135. A more transparent accounting and regulatory framework would strengthen
subnational fiscal discipline and improve monitoring and evaluation of intergovernmental
flows. An internalization of spending and revenue-raising decision costs and strengthening of
debt data accuracy would improve subnational fiscal discipline. The establishment of a common
budget classification system in parallel to accounting harmonization would also enhance fiscal
transparency and support standardization across government levels. Fiscal transparency at the
subnational level, including the preparation of medium and long-term budget projections, would
facilitate the identification of longer term fiscal risks related to population aging and support the
establishment of a comprehensive national fiscal risk management strategy.

136. Hardening budget constraints at the subnational level mitigate contingent fiscal
risks for the sovereign. The Government must define expenditure responsibilities more clearly,
with health and education being two main areas of overlapping responsibilities. Weaknesses in
information and reporting systems make it difficult to clearly separate federal and state
responsibilities and assess whether federal funds have been used effectively. Furthermore, there
is still the need to improve local revenue raising capacity and strengthen the predictability of
intergovernmental transfer rules.

                              Annex 5: Poverty and Social Impact Evaluation
Introduction

137.    The policies supported by the proposed operation are expected to have a positive
social impact, by contributing to protect pro-poor program budgets, increase financial
inclusion, and improve the Government’s response to natural disasters. This Poverty and
Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) explores how the implemented policies could translate into
improved welfare. Although there is a lack of data to measure the impact of these policies ex
ante with any precision, the continued promotion of budget stability and transparency and
implementation of enhanced disaster risk management policies have the potential to improve the
welfare of the poor. The third policy area, related to sub-national debt, could lead to a decline in
welfare in so far as the over-indebted states are also those with greater probability of being
affected by natural disasters. In this PSIA we outline the potential impacts and channels of
transmission resulting from the implementation of the policies supported in this DPL.

A. Poverty in Mexico

138. Despite earlier progress in poverty reduction, poverty reversed its declining trend as
of 2008. Mexico saw a dramatic decline in poverty between 1996 and 2006 with poverty falling
by almost 22 percentage points (Figure 1). Income (patrimonio) poverty fell to its lowest point
in 2006, at 42.7 percent, before reversing the 10-year trend. Food and fuel price shocks and the
2008 financial crisis led to the rise in poverty incidence. Between 2006 and 2008 and 2008 and
2010, poverty increased by 5 and 3.6 percentage points, respectively.

139. Rural poverty continues to exceed urban poverty. As reflected in Figure 2, the recent
narrowing of the gap between rural and urban poverty is the result of a rise in urban poverty and

2006-2008 period, when both rural and urban poverty grew, in 2008-2010 the increase in poverty
was driven by rising urban poverty.

140. The multi-dimensional nature of poverty has led Mexico to move away from a single
monetary measure of welfare. In 2008 the country introduced a multi-dimensional measure of
poverty (MDI) that is an index comprised of a monetary measure (income) along with measures
of schooling gaps, access (or lack of) to health care, social security, food and basic dwelling
services, as well as housing quality and crowding (see CONEVAL 2010 for more details on how
this is constructed). Data from this new index show that between 2008 and 2010 the rise in
multi-dimensional poverty was slightly slower (44.5 to 46.2 percent), than the rise in income
poverty (47.7 to 51.3 percent) (See Figure 3). This is due to positive changes in the non-income
aspects of welfare in the country, with the increase in health insurance (Seguro Popular) playing
a large role. Additionally, there was an improvement in social indicators while vulnerability to
income poverty rose slightly.

141. Variations in multi-dimensional poverty are particularly striking across states.47 In
multi-dimensional terms poverty rates vary from a low of 21.1 percent in Nuevo Leon to a high
of 78.4 percent in Chiapas, while the recent economic shocks have affected states in different
ways (Figure 4). Ten states experienced a drop in poverty between 2008 and 2010: in Coahuila
the decline was almost 15 percent and in Morelos almost 11 percent. In contrast, in five states,
Baja California, Baja California Sur, Colima, Chihuahua, and Sonora, poverty rose by more than
20 percent.

142. The rise in overall poverty rates indicates the need to further attention on policies
that effectively tackle poverty. This is particularly relevant for urban areas, where poverty has
risen most in recent years. The uneven impact of crises on state level poverty must be kept in
mind, especially when linked to natural disasters.

B. Policy areas

1. Budget and Stability

143. The adoption of the Single Treasury Account has the potential to have a positive
effect on the poorer households in the country while the introduction of Cetes Directo will
more likely affect lower-middle income and middle income households.




                                                            
47
  Using only income poverty shows a very similar picture of state variation in poverty, indicating the high degree of correlation
between the two measures.

                                                               59 
 
1.1           Single Treasury Account:

144. As described in annex 4.b the adoption of the Single Treasury Account led to the
centralization of revenue and expenditure flows and shift toward electronic banking
payments. By promoting the use of the financial system for individuals who receive salaries,
pensions or social program transfers, the STA can play an important role in increasing financial
inclusion. Though a large share of formal sector pensioners and government employees have
linkages with the financial sector, many of those receiving benefits under the Government social
protection programs may not have previously had bank accounts.

145. The main social protection programs, such as Oportunidades and the Nutrition
Support Program, target households and individuals over-represented in the unbanked
population: the very poor, those living in rural areas, and women.48 Thus, for an important
segment of the poor in the country, the STA has the potential to increase financial inclusion and
welfare. Since 2007, the number of Oportunidades and Nutrition Support Program beneficiary
households being paid through the formal financial system has grown from 1.2 million to 2.3
million, increasing by over one million households in the formal financial sector (See Figure 5).

146. New financial system customers are substantially different from general bank
account holders.49 A 2010 survey of new financial system clients (DAI, 2010) shows that
Oportunidades’ recipients with accounts are largely female (Bansefi account holders receiving
Oportunidades are 97 percent female compared to only 68 percent for non-Oportunidades
recipients) and have very low levels of education (38 percent have less than a primary education
compared to only 14 percent of non-Oportunidades beneficiaries). Moreover, beneficiaries are
much more likely to be relatively new account holders with 63 percent having obtained an

                                                            
48
  Oportunidades gives funds directly to women in most cases.
49
  In Mexico the ‘Popular’ Savings and Credit Sector is comprised of institutions authorized under the ‘Ley de Ahorro y Crédito
Popular? of 2009. Bansefi is one of these organizations.

                                                                         60 
 
account in the last three years. In short, the electronic payment of benefits to social program
recipients seems to have pulled a new, underserved segment of the population into the financial
sector.

147.    Studies point to important benefits of financial inclusion on overall development
and household welfare. While the impact of Mexico’s STA related financial inclusion is, as
yet, unmeasured, there is evidence that increased financial access among households is
associated with lowering inequality (Honahan, 2007), while higher levels of financial penetration
(numbers of deposit accounts and loans as well as physical access to banking facilities) have
been shown to be positively associated with measures of development infrastructure (Kendal,
Mylenko and Ponce, 2010). A recent review by Kendal (2010) of the experimental evidence on
the impact of savings showed that increased access to formal saving mechanisms facilitates
saving for productive investments, protects household consumption and business activities from
unexpected shocks and leads to higher income, profits, and investment in participating
households.

148. In Mexico access to financial services is correlated with welfare gains. The 2002
expansion of Azteca bank via the opening of new offices in stores led to an increase in
employment, income and new businesses in the areas with new branch offices (Bruhn and Love,
2009). Aportela (1999) found that the expansion of the Patronato del Ahorro Nacional (now
Bansefi) led to a 3-5 percent average increase in formal savings, and 6-8 percent among low
income savers. Similarly, Djankov (2008) finds that per capita consumption and wealth are
higher among banked households (32 percent and 88 percent more respectively) holding constant
occupational and demographic characteristics. Finally, for firms, a lack of credit has been shown
to be a constraint. In an experiment wherein small firms were given cash and capital stock, the
estimated return to capital was 20-33 percent per month, well above the interest rate (Cull,
McKenzie and Woodruff, 2007). The effect was more marked among the more financially
constrained firms.

149. Even the extreme poor have demand for savings. Research has shown that there is
substantial saving activity among some of the world’s poorest groups. In Bangladesh and South
Africa the very poor save in various ways, using from 4 to 10 different savings instruments per
year (Collins et al, 2009). There is demand for saving products that allow savers to protect their
funds from household demands or ‘impulse’ spending. A recent BANSEFI study revealed that
76.5 percent of clients or potential clients of the Savings and Credit Sector in Mexico agreed
that, “it is better not to save at home to avoid temptations to spend the money? (DAI 2010). In
fact, savings outside of the home is valued enough in many places that people actually pay to
save (see the example of Ghana in Aryeetey and Gockel (1991)).

150. In spite of the transition toward electronic payments, the majority of Oportunidades
and Nutrition Support Program beneficiaries are still paid in cash. Two thirds (down from
76 percent in 2008) of the beneficiaries, 4.2 million out of 6. 4 million households were paid in
cash in 2010 (see Figure 5). This largely reflects that 40 percent of Oportunidades households
live in areas with under 500 inhabitants (SEDESOL) and with few services. Even though
Mexico has a high level of bank accounts and bank branches per adult population compared to
the Latin American average, the number of branches per square kilometer is just below the

                                               61 
 
regional average (CGAP and WB, 2010). This indicates a high degree of geographic
concentration of banks and bank branches, which leave segments of the population without
adequate coverage (See Figures 6 and 7).

C. Impact of the Proposed DPL

151. Revenue and payment centralization is improving coordination between federal
government entities and will likely increase the number of beneficiary payments made
through the financial sector. No estimates exist as to how this might affect the number of
payments linked to savings accounts to beneficiaries of social programs. If, however, the growth
                                              62 
 
in electronic payments follows the same trajectory as that since 2007, a further million
households or low-income women with very limited education could be offered access to the
financial sector for the first time: an important change in financial inclusion overall and among
the poor particularly. SEDESOL is presently working on proposals that will expand this access,
even in areas that are underserved by the traditional banking services.

152. The net impact of the incorporation of additional households into the financial
sector is unknown. Accounts opened solely for the receipt of salary or benefit payments may
simply be used as a pass through with monies being deposited by the Government and
withdrawn in their entirety by the account holder. Recent research in Mexico shows that while
households receiving remittances were more likely to have a bank account (as a means to receive
the funds) the savings use of these accounts was limited and not typically employed to establish
a lending relationship with the institution (Demirguc-Kunt et al 2008). It is not clear whether
this is because remittance-receiving households have lower needs for credit than other
households or simply because such households are not actually taking advantage of the
institutional affiliation. In the case of SEDESOL beneficiaries, there are rules that the recipient
must use some of the funds deposited every two months or the account is declared inactive.
While this does not mean that funds must be withdrawn or spent, there is some anecdotal
evidence that households believe this to be the case. Unfortunately, there is little data available
on how the recipients use their accounts. The 2010 study for BANSEFI (DAI 2010) showed that
although 61 percent of individuals receiving Oportunidades would like a savings account,
overall beneficiaries with such accounts were much more likely to save at home (54 percent)
than non-beneficiaries (35 percent). Additionally, aggregate data shows that while Mexico has
substantially more bank accounts per capita than other countries in the region, the amount of
funds held in such accounts is very small (either as a share of GDP or per capita income) (See
Figure 8). In part, this may reflect the other savings options that exist in Mexico (government
bonds for example as is examined below), but in part it may reflect direct-payment recipients not
taking advantage of financial institution access.

153. Given the potential expansion of formal financial sector access, it is important to
gain a better understanding as to the impact on individuals and households. SEDESOL
programs promoting savings and credit use among beneficiaries could enhance the benefit of the
STA on poor households. Tracking data on the take up (new accounts) and use of existing
accounts (as a minimum-share of transfers saved) will be critical to understanding the potentially
large welfare impacts of the STA.

Cetes Directo

154. The second supported policy area in the budget and stability area involves the
electronic retail purchase of treasury bonds. The program is expected to expand the pool of
investors in government securities, by introducing new savings options to inexperienced or first
time investors. By maintaining a low minimum investment level it is expected that individuals
further down the income ladder will be able to take advantage of this investment and savings
tool.

155. The Cetes Directo program in Mexico started in late 2010 and in less than a year had
the same number of investors as the Brazilian Tesouro Direto program in its first year of
operation. It is, however, unlikely that the substantial growth rates seen in Tesouro Direto’s
first few years will be matched in Mexico given the present global economic situation. The
lower growth numbers seen by Tesouro Direto after the crisis might provide a more plausible
growth trend. The impact on savings from the growth of Cetes Directo accounts for a significant
portion of the population may be a longer term effort.

156. Half of all current Cetes Directo investors are holdings under 100 pesos (US$9)
(Figure 9). While no information is available on the employment of investors or other
characteristics that allow for their classification by income or other socio-economic measures,
the fact that such a large proportion of investors are investing such small quantities indicates that
the system may well be reaching its target investor.50 Despite an increase of Cetes Directo
investors, it is unlikely that the widening of the investor base will have a significant impact on
national poverty levels or the welfare of more than a small percentage of households.

157. Data suggests that the system is pulling in new investors. First, 49 percent of Cetes
Directo clients say that this is the first time they have invested, with the share of new investors
highest among low value investors (Figure 10). Second, a full 61 percent of clients claim limited
or no knowledge of financial terms. Actually, the knowledge of financial terms is quite low even
among larger investors, suggesting either a need for more financial education in the country or a
certain discomfort among investors in terms of their own knowledge. This suggests the potential
benefit of public information campaigns as well as more targeted financial literacy training.


                                                            
50
  It is possible that this reflects, instead, that investors are deliberately investing small amounts of money initially to test the
system and learn how it works. It seems unlikely, however, that this cautious investor is fully responsible for the observed
distribution.

Policy Area 2: Natural Disaster Risk Management

A. Mexico’s vulnerability to disaster

158. Mexico is very vulnerable to natural hazards, particularly earthquakes and
hurricanes, which has led to strong disaster risk management efforts. In 1985, an 8.1
magnitude earthquake devastated Mexico City, killing over 10,000 people and causing massive
damage.52 Not only did the earthquake highlight the country’s vulnerability to intensive natural
disasters but also revealed the fiscal implications of such an event. The earthquake took place
soon after Mexico’s debt default to foreign creditors, making it difficult to suspend payments on
recently restructured debts to help with the recovery.

159. Mexico’s location on the ring of fire and its extensive coast lines on both the Pacific
and Atlantic Oceans place more than two-thirds of the country’s population and GDP at
risk from natural disasters (De La Fuente, 2010). The vastness of the exposure to natural
disasters has broad implications for both infrastructure costs and socio-economic vulnerability
and poverty. An increase in the knowledge of physical capital exposure has helped raise
awareness about the importance and the targeting of disaster risk management. Figure 12
reflects pre and post-disaster spending in Mexico.

160. Households with few resources located in hazard-prone areas are most vulnerable to
natural disasters. However, two important limitations exist for identifying the causal impact of
natural disasters on social welfare indicators. The first one reflects the fact that while the
occurrence of a natural hazard could be considered exogenous, its transformation into a disaster
is not. In other words, the combination of risk exposure combined with household and
community characteristics (environmental, human and economic) is what determines the scope
of the disaster. Estimating the impact of disasters on poverty requires data spanning many object
categories and techniques to address the existence of a double causality (Rodriguez-Oriegga, De
La Fuente, De La Torre, Moreno, & Rodriguez, 2010). The second limitation relates to data.
Data bases typically do not include adequate information on the occurrence of low frequency
disasters with high consequences, because the window of opportunity covered for disasters that
have occurred is very short. This means that even when it is possible to assess the impact of
disasters, the assessment is essentially limited to the effects of intensive disasters. Extensive

disasters receive comparatively less attention in spite of their destructive potential for vulnerable
communities, particularly in states with low institutional capacity. Furthermore, like intensive
disasters, extensive disasters have also been increasing in numbers in Mexico (Figure 14). For
example, the annual average number of extensive loss reports associated with floods, rains and
flash floods has increased eight-fold since 1980. These hazards accounted for 31 percent of all
extensive weather-related loss reports in the 1980s but over 40 percent in the last decade
(UNISDR, 2009).

161. Vulnerability to natural hazards and poverty are strongly correlated in Mexico.
Poorer communities generally face greater exposure and longer-lasting impact to natural
disasters. While the monetary value of the asset loss for poor households may be less than for
wealthier households, the loss of a fraction of those assets may imply a greater loss in welfare.
Adding to the negative effect of the disaster, such loses may be less likely to trigger official aid
in the form of compensation or reconstruction. There is a strong correlation in Mexico between
poorer municipalities53 and those exposed to medium-high risk of disasters (seismic and hydro –
floods and hurricanes). For example, Mansilla (2008) finds that municipalities with the greatest
number of loss reports also had large percentages of population with high or very high levels of
marginality - Acapulco (54.4 percent), Coatzocoalcos (54.1 percent), Juarez (45 percent),

                                                               68 
 
Tapachula (54.1 percent), Tijuana (31.3 percent) or Veracruz (31 percent).54 In contrast, only 8
percent of the housing stock was affected in municipalities with low or very low levels of
marginality. The combination of vulnerability to risk and poverty translates into higher and
longer impact of disasters on poorer communities. In the case of Mexico, Rodriguez-Oriegga et
al (2010), shows that natural disasters reduce human development and increase poverty, and this
effect can be sizeable: the average impact on human development in the affected areas is similar
to a two-year reversal of their human development gains over the 5-year period reviewed. The
impact of natural disasters is also higher for those municipalities with lower levels of human
development while no effects are found for the wealthier municipalities (See Figure 14).55


B. Impact of the proposed DPL

162. The impact of the policies implemented in the natural disaster risk management
policy area will likely be positive and contribute to improving disaster risk management in
the medium term. The proposed DPL will improve the Government’s ability to respond to and
mitigate the impact of disasters by allowing Federal funds to disburse immediately, without the
need to wait for state matching funds. In so doing, the DPL will help the Government improve its
capacity to protect all of its citizens - including the most vulnerable- from the natural hazards
threatening Mexico. The changes in FONDEN’s rules will enhance the Government’s capacity to
prevent and manage disaster response, an improvement all the more important in the larger
context of climate change and the uncertain international economic context.

163. The capacity of the federal government to independently finance and manage
reconstruction activities is expected to improve the speed of funding allocations and
reconstruction, particularly in states with weaker institutional capacity, which also tend to
be the poorest. This reform will enable FONDEN to commit and disburse reconstruction funds
more quickly. Combined with the issuance of an indemnity-based product to cover natural
disaster events in excess of FONDEN’s available resources, this reform increases the
Government’s capacity to respond to intensive disaster across the country, regardless of the
affected state’s capacity. Given that several states with weaker institutional capacity also count
among those with high rates of poverty and vulnerability to natural hazards, the proposed
reforms can be expected to benefit most the poorer states with high vulnerability to natural
hazards and thus better protect their most vulnerable citizens living in at-risk areas.
                                                            
54
   Municipalities with high or very high levels of marginality had high proportions of damaged and destroyed housing. In a third
of these municipalities, between 10 and 25 percent of the housing stock was damaged or destroyed, while in another third this
proportion was more than 25 percent. Over 20 percent had more than 50 percent of their housing stock affected.
55
   Other studies exploring the impact of disasters on households include Carter, Little, & Mogues, 2007; Baez & Santos, 2007;
De Janvry, Sadoulet, Salomo, & Vakis, 2006; and Alpizar, 2007. Carter, Little and Mogues (2007) looked at the impact of
droughts in Ethiopia and hurricane Mitch in Honduras on growth of assets at the household level. In the case of Ethiopia, they
find a pattern of asset smoothing among low income families, i.e. households hold onto their assets even in periods where income
and consumption decreases, such as the drought in question. They find for Honduran households that relatively wealthy families
recovered faster from the shock than low-income families, and that a poverty trap is set below a given level of income. Baez and
Santos (2007) analyzed the effects of Mitch on household indicators, finding no effect on school enrollment of children, but a
significant increase in their labor participation. Others have analyzed how some coping mechanisms within households affect
recovery from a shock derived from a natural disaster. De Janvry et al (2006) show that the availability of conditional cash
transfers prior to a disaster serves as a safety net for those exposed to the disaster, while the uninsured and vulnerable poor use an
increase in child labor, and savings in nutrition and school costs as coping mechanism. Alpizar (2007) finds that access to formal
financial services mitigates the negative effects of natural disaster shocks for farmers in El Salvador, as it leads to more efficient
production. 

                                                                 69 
 
164. The policies supported by the DPL will likely protect the Federal budget from fiscal
pressures, and therefore diminish the need for ad hoc budget reallocations and reductions
in response to a disaster. The predictability and stability of the Federal budget is important: it
affects investor confidence as well as the continuity of social programs and investments in
human capital. Those policies are further reinforced by several key agencies (CONAGUA, SEP
and the Ministry of Health) attainment of disaster insurance. These measures particularly benefit
the most vulnerable, who would be most exposed to the agencies’ inability to provide services
and emergency support.

165. Furthermore, the new policies take place in the larger context of the Government’s
efforts - through FONDEN- to improve disaster risk management, both in terms of
prevention and reconstruction. New policies will streamline disaster risk management funding,
in particular to improve the tracking of funds allocated for reconstruction. To promote effective
reconstruction, FONDEN is implementing a new system, backed by a centralized database of
disaster impacts, assets and reconstruction allocation. The new system will improve the funding
of post-disaster reconstruction, allow for the identification of problematic cases (i.e. not simply
the cases outstanding due to the non-completion of administrative/paperwork processes) and thus
increase expenditure control and supervision. This will result in a more efficient use of
supervision resources and faster problem identification, directly and indirectly benefiting
vulnerable populations.

166. States with weaker institutional capacity or lower resources may find it difficult to
comply with FONDEN new reconstruction rules, requiring states to subscribe to an
insurance mechanism in order to protect their infrastructure and assets. Non-compliance
with the insurance requirement will lead to progressive penalization with the Federal
Government gradually reducing reconstruction cost coverage. Given the large overlap in states
between vulnerability to disasters and poverty, this new rule presents risks for poorer
communities. If a state is unable to fulfill the requirement in the periods indicated, there could
be a gap in needed reconstruction resources. While mechanisms to assist less affluent states are
likely to be implemented during the transition, there is a risk that some states with weaker
institutional capacity or lower resources may find themselves unable to comply with the
requirement. Careful monitoring of this situation is needed to ensure that poorer areas are not
negatively affected in the short run. It will also be necessary to monitor where funding is going.
In a state with multiple reconstruction needs, the fact that federal funds can be disbursed prior to
the matching state funds could lead to a bias in what infrastructure is reconstructed first. Will the
money first go to the easily reached secondary school or will it be targeted to the remote primary
school serving poor children?

167. There is substantial inequality in the spatial distribution of federal infrastructure.
This has important implications in terms of disaster management, notably regarding prevention
through the ‘build back better’ component. The Government has initiated a shift towards a more
pro-active preventive strategy of disaster management. In the case of FONDEN, this strategy is
represented in the ‘build-back-better’ requirement where the reconstructed or rehabilitated
infrastructure or eligible low-income housing is built to a higher building code. The goal of this
is to increase the resilience to future natural hazards. The policy can have negative

                                                 70 
 
ramifications, however. The build-back-better policy raises the cost of reconstruction. On the
one hand, it will skew the total federal spending on disasters even further toward richer states
with more infrastructure. On the other hand, as was seen in 2010, cutting the ‘build-back-better’
or preventive component can be seen as a way to save money when an inordinate number of
disasters occur.56 While 2010 is considered a particularly exceptional year in terms of disasters,
the repetition of this situation could negatively affect poorer states and municipalities with older
infrastructure. There is a risk that some infrastructure rebuilding deemed too expensive to be
adjusted to the new building regulations standard might not happen.

168. The Government needs to incorporate additional measures regarding the socio-
economic impact of disasters, particularly on poverty, to its disaster risk management
strategy. While FONDEN’s mandate focuses on physical capital, a number of key welfare issues
are directly related to infrastructure, especially in a country displaying such a high level of
spatial inequality. This inequality is further heightened in the case of disasters by the respective
states institutional capacity, as well as by the nature of the disaster. Indeed, intensive disasters
are more likely to trigger an automatic response and receive more attention from the Federal
State, while extensive lower-level disasters may cause repetitive damages with substantial but
less visible socio-economic consequences. Other federal agencies have also taken pro-active
disaster risk management measures as previously noted. Consultations with officials from
FONDEN and those ministries and agencies indicate close collaboration. However, from a
monitoring and analytical point of view, FONDEN’s sole focus on physical capital omits key
information actually available (for instance from SEDESOL and other agencies) that would help
understand the differentiated impact of disasters on communities. Integrating these sources of
information could help in the targeting and prioritization of reconstruction interventions, as well
as in promoting an integrated approached to disaster prevention and reconstruction.

169. In addition to examining the direct impact the policies may have, future analysis in
the disaster risk management policy areas will also look at: (a) policies and programs for
resettling people living in areas of declared high risk, (b) whether socio-cultural adaptation
measures are in place for reaching Indigenous communities in both prevention and response
activities, and (c) the extent to which Mexico’s systems for disaster response compare to
international human rights standards for internally displace people.


Policy Area 3: Subnational Debt Management

170. The recent sharp increase in subnational debt has implications for disaster risk
management and poverty reduction. In a constrained financial environment, a significant
increase in debt levels is likely to have substantial consequences with respect to those States’
financial capacity as well as on their social spending. Several of the heavily indebted states, such
as Quintana Roo, Veracruz, Nuevo Leon, Nayarit, Michoacán, are highly exposed to natural
disasters, making them all the more vulnerable to natural disaster shocks. This situation creates a
financial challenge for states with limited fiscal space when faced with an intensive disaster, and
                                                            
56
   To highlight the fact that resources were being spent on preventive and well as ‘curative’ activities, the FONDEN budget was
split to allow the ‘build-back-better’ funds their own budget line. This backfired as it made the funds look optional (which they
are not, one cannot build a building today the only meets building codes from the 1960s for example) and led to their being cut.

                                                               71 
 
also burdens the Federal government that must step in to mitigate the impact for the local
population. The case of extensive disasters is even more problematic for indebted states, with
their financial condition limiting their capacity to respond and mitigate the consequences of
those types of disasters. This situation would likely affect more vulnerable communities with an
even higher degree of impact and longer lasting socio-economic consequences.
