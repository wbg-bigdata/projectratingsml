                                             CREDIT SUMMARY

  Borrower:          Republic of Moldova

  Amount:            SDR 6.1million(US$lO million equivalent)

  Terms:             StandardIDA Terms, with 40 years maturity, includinga 10-yeargrace period

  Objectives:        The proposed Second Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC2) for the Republic of
                     Moldovais intendedto bolster anddeepen the reformefforts supported by the first PRSC
                     (PRSC1). The proposedcredit aims to support Government's effortsto accelerate shared
                     economic growth and improve governanceby addressingthe efficiency of its expenditure
                     programsand public administration- key elements inpoverty reduction. To this end, the
                     proposed PRSC2 will continue to support selective areas o f the Government's reform
                     agenda, as outlined in the National Development Plan (NDS) - the successor to the
                     Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (EGPRSP) - andthe European
                     Union(EU)-Moldovaactionplan. The proposedPRSC2 also complementsandreinforces
                      other Bank Group programs in Moldova, the International Monetary Fund (IMF)-
                      supported Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) and other donor activities. The
                      PRSC2will supportthe Government's objectives o f

                      Improving the Investment Climate. Sustaining and accelerating future growth and
                      poverty reduction in Moldova will depend on increases in domestic productivity which,
                      inturn, will depend on the extent to which firms and farms address current low levels of
                      investment and innovation. This, in turn, depends on the quality of governance and the
                      business environment. The Government's reform agenda focuses on further improving
                      the investment climate for private sector development. These efforts will also directly
                      contribute to Government efforts to improve governance and reduce corruption. An
                      important element of Moldova's efforts to accelerate economic growth and poverty
                      reductionwill be improvingthe performance ofthe agriculturesector. Similarly, reducing
                      destabilizing economic impacts of external energy price shocks will require
                      improvements inenergy efficiency.

                      Improving the Efficiency and Management of Public Resources. Better governance
                      and public institutions are central to growth and poverty reduction. The Government is
                      conscious of the constraint imposed by the insufficient functional and institutional
                      adaptation of the public administration to the requirements o f a market economy.
                      Advancing reforms that establish a modern and efficient public administration is
                      necessary inorder to achievethe country's longer-termdevelopmentoutcomes. Increased
                      public investment spending, particularly in public infrastructure, will be needed in order
                      to support Moldova's private-sector led growth. This will require enhancingthe strategic
                      allocation of public resourcesby improving the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework
                      (MTEF) process, public procurement practices and including better public investment
                      management.Reforms in a number of key sectoral areas can also improve the efficiency
                      o f public resourceuse, allowingfor spendingreallocationtowardspublic investment.

                      Strengthening Pension and Social Assistance Systems. While the recent slowdown in
                      poverty reduction - as well as the impact of the drought on rural poverty - highlightsthe

                  needto improvethe quality of growth inMoldova, it also points to the needto strengthen
                  existingsocial safety nets. The secondPRSC would support the Government's efforts to
                  strengthen the effectiveness and future fiscal viability of the pay-as-you-go pension
                  program by supportingefforts to complete the 1999pensionreform, includingefforts to
                  unify the pensionsystem for all types of pensioners.With higher energy and food prices
                  likely to persist for some time to come, improving targeting efficiency o f social
                  assistance programs and gainingefficiency in program administrationwill be necessary
                  elements of Moldova's povertyreductionefforts.

Benefits:         Benefits are: (i)improvedbusiness environment and investment climate, which directly
                  contributes to changing the quality of growth and poverty reduction in Moldova by
                  stimulating the development o f a stronger privates sector supply response; (ii)a more
                  professionalcivil service combined with increased transparency and accountability of
                  public finances with improvedpublicexpendituremanagementand strategic allocationof
                  resources enabling an increase in current low levels of public sector investment,
                  particularly in rapidly deteriorating public infrastructure; (iii)strengthening existing
                  social safety nets for vulnerable groups by completing the 1999 pension reform and
                  improvingthe targetingefficiency o f social assistanceprograms.

Risks:            Primary risks to the proposed PRSC2 include:(i)looming elections which may rupture
                 the political consensus that has developed behind the Government's ambitious reform
                  program; (ii)low implementationcapacity at the central and decentralized level, though
                  dovetailing the PRSC2 with other Bank Group operations and donor activities that
                  provide support to capacity building helps mitigate this risk; (iii)destabilizingexternal
                  shocks, such as another drought, volatile energy and food prices as well as trade
                  restrictions imposed on Moldova exports, could affect economic growth, undermine
                  public finances and delay implementation of poverty reduction measures in the
                  Government's reform program. The PRSC2's support to prudent fiscal policy and
                 medium-term budget planning, combined with an IMF PRGF program and increased
                 donor support, help mitigatethese risks.

                                     PROGRAM    DOCUMENT


                                     I. INTRODUCTION

1.     This program document proposes a single-tranche Second Poverty Reduction Support
Credit (PRSC2) to the Republic of Moldova for SDR 6.1 million (US$lO million equivalent) on
standard International Development Association (IDA) terms. The PRSC program is an integral
part of the Bank's strategy to support the implementation of Moldova's National Development
Strategy (NDS)- the successor to the Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(EGPRSP) - as well as the EU-Moldova Action Plan. The continued support for poverty
reduction through programmatic lending is consistent with Moldova's level of institutional,
economic and political development and acknowledges the country's strong and sustained
economic and policy performance inrecent years. The PRSC program i s intendedto support the
Government's efforts to improve the quality of governance and promote the efficiency of public
expenditures and public administration. PRSC2 is the second in a series of three single tranche
operations that would continue to support the implementation of cross cutting reforms aimed at
improvingthe living conditions ofthe Moldovanpopulation.

2.     Recent developmentshighlightingMoldova's undiversified economy and its vulnerability
to external shocks - a Russianban on Moldova wine imports, a doubling of energy prices, and a
crippling drought - have reinforced the Government awareness that the quality of economic
growth and poverty reduction needs to be changed. To accelerate economic growth and poverty
reduction, the three pillars of the PRSC program support the Government's efforts to: i)improve
the investment climate so as to stimulate a greater private sector supply response; ii)increasethe
efficiency and improve the management and allocation of public sector resources to create fiscal
space for increased public investment spending; and, iii)strengthen social protection systems to
betterprotect the poor andvulnerable groups.

3.     Bilateral and multilateral donor assistance will continue to play an important role in
supporting the implementation of the NDS and EU-Action Plan. The PRSC program is also an
important step to further the principles of harmonization, by providing a framework for policy
dialogue and decisions linkedto progress inthe implementations of the critical areas of the NDS.
Insupport of the NDS, the PRSC2 has createdthe momentum for a significant group of donors
to align their budgetary support under a common framework. As with the first PRSC, the second
PRSC will be supported by financing from the United Kingdom Department for International
Development (DFID) and the DutchGovernment. There has been a high degree of coordination
with the EUinthe context ofthe EuropeanNeighborhoodPolicy Initiative.

                           A.     RECENT   ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS

4.      External Shocks and Economic Performance. Growth has averaged around 5.5 percent
per annum since the economic recovery began in 2000. Moldova's economic performance over
the last two years, however, has been dampened by a number of external shocks. In early 2006,
Russia banned the import of wine from Moldova. As wine exports to Russia represent some 25
percent of Moldovanexports (or about 10percent of GDP), this banhad a negative impact on the
real sector of the economy. Over the same period, the economy, which is completely dependent
on imported energy, has also had to cope with the doubling of natural gas prices by Russia's
Gazprom. Most recently, inthe summer o f 2007, the Moldovanagricultural sector -representing
14 percent of GDP - was severely affected by a drought with losses in the sector estimated at
nearly 30 percent of production. As a result of these shocks, real GDP growth slowed to 4
percent in2006 and it i s expectedthat growth will remain around 5 percent in2007.

5.      Since the recovery began in 2000, GDP growth in Moldova has largely been driven by
domestic household consumption and construction fueled by massive inflows of workers'
remittances - estimated at 37 percent of GDP in 2007. There are encouraging signs, however,
that the earlier model of consumption-driven growth is changing with private investment
growing as a share of GDP - reaching over 22% of GDP in 2007. While public investment has
also increased in recent years, it remains low with the result that public infrastructure,
particularly roads, has continued to deteriorate. Over the medium-term, the NDS recognizes that
Moldova will needto generate a stronger and more robust domestic supply response with future
gains inproductivityrequiring increasedprivate andpublic investment.

6.      The large inflow of remittances has contributed to appreciation pressure on the real and
nominal exchange rate. The National Bank o f Moldova (NBM) has actively intervened in the
foreign exchange market and has been rapidly accumulating foreign exchange reserves. To rein
inthe monetary impact ofthese interventions-andinflationary pressures-theNBMhas sharply
increased its sterilization efforts since 2005 to slow reserve money growth. The significant
increase in energy prices since 2005 and the impact of the drought on domestic food prices has
complicated the NBM goal of reducing inflation to single digits. Inflationary pressures in the
economy have persisted over the last two years with average prices increasing by nearly 13
percent inboth2006 and 2007.

7.      Prudent FiscalPolicy. Despite the external shocks, the Government has demonstrateda
strong commitment to maintaining its prudent fiscal stance. General Government revenues and
expenditures have increased by close to 2 percentagepoints of GDP ineach of the last two years
reaching around 43 percent of GDP in2007 (muchhigher than most countries with similar levels
o f income). Robust revenue performance and expenditure constraint resulted in a small budget
surplus (0.2 percent of GDP) in 2006 and a small fiscal deficit (-0.3 o f GDP), above the IMF
program targets of a -0.5% deficit.

8.      In early 2007, the Government undertook a major reform of its corporate income tax
(CIT) regime with purpose o f stimulating investment. Starting in 2008, companies are exempt
from corporate tax on reinvested profits (Le. a zero rate for the CITYexcept for dividends and
non-business expenses). At the same time, the package of measures also granted a fiscal amnesty


                                                 2

for the tax debts of companies upto the start of 2007, a liberalization of capital repatriation rules.
Personal income taxes have also been reduced, with the highest marginal rate declining from 32
percent to 20 percent.

9.        On the expenditure side, spending on health, education and social protection comprise
nearly two-thirds of total government expenditures - increasing by nearly 8 percentage points of
GDP since 2000. While fiscal surpluses and debt rescheduling has allowed the public interest
burden to decline considerably (interest payments have fallen to 1.3 percent of GDP in 2007
comparedto 6.4 percent in2000), increases inpublic sector wages (from 8% of GDP in2004 to
9.5% in2007) have put pressure on the budget. After many years of neglect, public expenditures
on capital and operation and maintenance of basic infrastructure are still insufficient to prevent
the continued deterioration.

10.      Remittances Dominate External Sector. Moldova i s a very open economy with exports
and imports amounting to nearly 50 and 100 percent of GDP respectively. Nearly 60 percent of
Moldova's exports are in the form of agricultural products (including from the agro-processing
industry) and predominately from the wine and beverage sectors. Though the direction of trade
has been slowly redirectedtowards the EU (and this trend accelerated with the recent expansion
o f the EU), this transformation has been much slower than in other transition countries.


                                                       3

Moldova's vulnerability to external trade shocks has been amply demonstrated in the last two
years, as has the ability of the economy to adjust to those shocks.

11.    The remittance-fueled increase in consumption as well as higher energy prices have
resulted in a rapid growth of imports (averaging nearly 25 percent since 2005). Export growth
has averaged only 14 percent since 2005, reflecting the impact of Russia's ban on Moldovan
wine in 2006 (exports grew at 0.5 percent in 2006). While this ban persisted into 2007, exports
rebounded growing at nearly 25 percent. The trade deficit, exceeding 50 percent of GDP in2007,
has largely been offset by the large inflows of workers' remittances. As a result, the current
account deficit has beenmore modest, averaging slightly less than 6 percent of GDP since 2000.
Capital inflows have permitted a rapid growth in international reserves, increasing from 2.1
months of reserves in2001 to 3.0 months in2007 (the IMF program target).


                B.      MACROECONOMIC AND DEBTSUSTAINABILITY
                                             OUTLOOK

12.    A satisfactory macroeconomic framework has remained in place. The IMF Executive
Board concluded the third review o f the three-year arrangement under the SDR 110.9 million
Poverty Reduction and GrowthFacility (PRGF) on March 12,2008.

13.    Despite consecutive external shocks (wine ban, energy prices increases, drought), the
economy has done remarkable well. While these shocks have contributed to an economic
slowdown compared to the performance experienced over the 2001-2005 period, real GDP
growth has remained positive and the economy is expectedto rebound in2008. Nonetheless, the
economy will be subject to a number of continuing pressures:
   0   GlobaZ uncertainties. Moldova has become increasingly integrated with the global
       economy with remittances flows dominating the external sector. The heavy reliance on
       remittance flows exposes Moldova to greater risks in the event of an external downturn.
       These risks are compounded by the lack of product and market diversification in external
       flows.
   0   Energy andfoodprices. As per the agreement reached with Gazprom, energy prices will
       continue to increase over the next five years until they are at market (Le. European)
       levels. The coming increases in natural gas prices will force further adjustments in an
       economy that still i s inefficient in its energy use. While Moldova is a net food exporter,
       higher international food prices could increase poverty rates among net food consumers
       and insofar as Government policy discriminates against net food producers, could
       undermineagricultural development.
   0   Climate Change. The 2007 drought had a significant impact on agricultural producers.
       While the sector has beendeclining inrelative importance (shrinking as a share of GDP),
       it has generally underperformed relative to other sectors and, hence, it has beena drag on
       overall economic growth. While the drought will have some lingering effects on the
       sector inthe first part of 2008, the effect of the drought on real GDP growth is expected
       to be relatively short-lived. Nevertheless, future weather-related events pose a continuing
       riskto the sector and, hence, overall economic growth.

14.    Despite these risks, strong consumption growth and the expansion of investment activity
suggest an improvement in medium-termgrowth prospects with real GDP growth of 7 percent
expected over the 2008-2009 period. Over the longer term, there is a risk that, with nearly a


                                                  4

quarter o f the labor force already working abroad, Moldova's remittance driven growth will be
difficult to sustain. Further, it will become increasingly difficult to generate past growth in labor
productivity since the opportunities provided by labor shedding and factor reallocation in the
economy are gradually being exhausted. The vulnerability to external shocks highlights the need
to generate a stronger domestic supply response and resource reallocation by increasing
investment, innovation and exports. There are encouraging signs that Moldova's model of
consumption-driven-growth is already beginning to shift. Domestic private investment has
increased from 14 percent of GDP in2003 to roughly 22 percent of GDP in2007. Foreign direct
investment has also accelerated from 3 percent of GDP in 2003-2004 to 6-7 percent of GDP in
2005-2006. The preliminary estimates for 2007 suggest that this figure is now over 10percent of
GDP   .

 15.    The macroeconomic framework whichunderpinsthe authorities' program aims at gradual
disinflation in the coming years. The fiscal program has the objective of supporting disinflation
efforts of tighter monetary policy while allowing the Government some room to meet the
country's extensive developmental needs. The strong inflow of foreign exchange complicates the
conduct of monetary policy, given the reluctance of the authorities to see the exchange rates
appreciate. Further real appreciation, however, appears unavoidable in the face of growing
foreign exchange inflows and, hence, more exchange rate flexibility will be needed to ease
inflationary pressures. Given that the exchange appears to be undervalued, there is some scope
for further appreciation without raising significant concerns about price competitiveness.

 16.    On the external front, higher energy prices, the consumption-driven increase in imports
and the impact of the wine ban on exports have resulted in a significant widening of the current
account deficit in since 2005, reaching 12 percent of GDP in 2006. In the first part o f 2007,
export growth has beenquite resilient (growing by 32 percent) which, along with the significant
increase inworkers' remittances, has resulted in some moderation of the current account deficit.
More moderate economic growth           - which will slow import growth - combined with the
development of alternative export markets will help improve the current account deficit in the
next few years. Sizable capital and financial inflows have enabled the NBM to build
international reserves towards the program target of 3 months of imports. The second PRSC
along with financing from the IMF, the European Union (EU) and other multilaterals and
bilateral donors will provide Moldova with sufficient external funding to meet its financing
needs.

17.     Debt Sustainability.Moldova's debt situation has continued to improve. Prudent fiscal
policy, rapid economic growth, appreciation of the US dollar with respect to other currencies
(SDR, Euro, Yen), net repayment to creditors and favorable rescheduling operations (covering
about 33 percent of the debt stock) have resulted in a rapid decline inthe ratio o f total external
debt to GDP -falling from 124percent of GDP in2000 to around 59 percent in2006. Public and
Publicly Guaranteeddebt (PPG) amountedto around 24 percent of GDP at end-2006 (down from
65 percent of GDP in 2001). External public debt is largely on concessional terms with the
preponderance of debt owed to multilateral lenders. Domestic currency public debt is modest at
less than 9 percent o f GDP. Private debt has been growing, with loans associated from FDI
becoming important - disbursements from FDI-linked loans comprise over 67 percent of new




                                                  5

private borrowing. As of end-2006, private sector debt and energy arrears are approximately 33
percent of GDP.'

18.        A recent debt sustainability analysis (see Board Document Number IDNSecM2008-
0141, February 13, 2008) suggests that Moldova's debt outlook remains favorable, with a low
risk of debt distress. Public debt anddebt-service to revenueratios are well below the appropriate
thresholds in both the baseline and "historical" scenarios. In the face of some severe external
shocks, the Moldovan authorities have maintained policies that have not allowed the debt
situation to deteriorate. Commitments by the Consultative Group and the MillenniumChallenge

                                                 C.      POVERTYPROFILE

19.        Moldova's economic recovery since 2000 has led to a massive movement out of income
poverty, though poverty reduction has recently stalled. Between 1999 and 2004, over 40 percent
of the population moved out of poverty representing the largest absolute decline in the ECA
region over this period. The fall in absolute poverty was broad-based, as poverty decreased
throughout all locations.

20.        Between 2004-2005, however, overall poverty increased despite sustained economic
growth, underpinnedby rising rural poverty. The increase inrural poverty coincided with stalled
farm restructuring characterized by a slight reversal of the amount of land used by individual
farms in 2002 and 2003. The delay in restructuring farms and getting land into the hands of
individual farmers-which               have been shown to be more efficient than large, corporate farms-
has had an adverse affect on agricultural output and farmer incomes. By keeping 50% of land
tied up in inefficient corporate farms, the land available to family farmers is reduced, which in
turn reduces their income-generating opportunities and often restricts them to practicing
subsistence agriculture. With few opportunities, many smallholders have no alternative but to
renttheir land at low rates to corporate farms, which usually pay inkind, andoften do not pay at

all. This further constrains incomes of smallholders. Inaddition, distortions and imperfections in
agricultural output and input markets reduce the scope for farm restructuring and rural poverty
reduction. Analysis shows that agricultural producers are receiving less for their outputs and
paying more for their inputs relative to international parity prices than they should.

       *Thesenumbers are not strictly comparablewith data from previousyears as explainedinthe maintext.


21.       Poverty data for 2006 drawn from the Household Budget Survey (HBS) have recently
become available. However, methodological improvements and revisions to the HBS prevent the
analysis of poverty trends through 2006.2Nonetheless, the 2006 data indicate that a third of the
population still lives in poverty and poverty remains very much a rural phenomenon. In urban
areas, for example, the poverty headcount i s 20.6 percent while inrural areas it is 34.1 per~ent.~
The data also indicate that poverty rates among pensioners, farmers and agricultural workers are
higher than other groups, While 2006 data are not comparable with earlier data, the sustained
rural character of poverty is not surprising given recent economic developments. The ban on
Moldovan wine imports in Russia, for example, clearly affected agricultural livelihoods
adversely (wine production is around 10 percent of GDP). It is also not surprising given the
continued underperformance of the agri-food sector. Government policy has also continued to
discriminate against smaller farmers.

22.      Data on poverty in 2007 are not yet available. This makes it difficult to assess the
combined poverty impact of the recent drought, the wine ban, and the continued rise in energy
prices. Staff calculations suggestthat the large reduction inagricultural output-if                 translated to a
fall infarmers' incomes-could have significant poverty implications. For example, a 15 percent
fall in real income could lead to a 4-percentage point increase in poverty among agricultural

* The sampling frame, sampling methodology and the questionnaire of the HBS, the main source of data for
measuring living standards, were all substantially revised in 2006 to make the survey more representative and
improvethe measurementof consumption.
  The 2006 urban poverty rate is much higher than those previous years. This may be due mostly to the
methodologicalbreak in the series. In part, this may also be due to the poverty impact o f the 2006 energy price
increases, which are likely to have affectedmostly urban households connectedto energy sources.The rural poor, in
contrast, were likely to have greater access to cheaper, and dirtier, sources o ffuel.

households. However, the reduction in output is also offset by rising grain prices, underpinned
both by the drought and by higher international grain prices. On the consumption side, there are
similar offsetting developments. Food price inflation in Moldova last year amounted to about
15.5 percent; however, overall inflation was 13.1 percent, thus suggestingthat the relative price
of food did not increase substantially. Given food shares o f expenditure, staff calculations
suggest a modest fall in purchasing power among the poor o f just over 3 percent. Meanwhile,
real wages have been growing by over 20 percent and transfers have grown equally rapidly,
suggesting that the net poverty impact of higher food prices may be muted to date. Finally,
Moldova is estimated to have experienced a 5 percent growth in real GDP in 2007. While
poverty is generally expectedto fall inresponse to economic growth, results of the cross-country
analysis o f the elasticity of poverty reduction to growth suggest that at modest levels of
economic growth, the responsivenessof poverty can vary ~ubstantially.~


               111.    THEGOVERNMENT'S           NATIONAL      DEVELOPMENT       STRATEGY

23.     The National Development Strategy (NDS), the successor to the EGPRSP, was adopted
by the MoldovanParliament on December 21,2007 and was endorsedby the Boards of IDA and
IMF, along with the Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) on March 20,2008. The NDS is the main
medium-term strategic planning paper which defines the developmental objectives over the
period 2008-2011 and will guide the budgetary process over this period. Under the NDS, the
Government will seek to better prioritize Governmental policies and establish a clear mechanism
for their funding from both domestic and external sources. As with the EGPRSP, the NDS was
developed inbroad-based consultations with stakeholders and civil society, and benefitedfrom a
participatory process that was organized under the supervision of a Participation Council
comprised of representatives of all stakeholder groups.

24.     The NDS addresses the Government's objective of reducing poverty ina comprehensive
development perspective. It seeks to improve the overall competitiveness of the economy while
at the same time promoting access to and quality of human resource development. The
Government's longer-term objective is to assist the structural transformation away from the
agriculture sector into industry and services, facilitate these sectors' absorption of agricultural
sector workers, and create the basis for sustained, private sector-led growth. Toward this end, its
priorities are to improve the business environment, promote the SME sector, improve the
efficiency of enterprises, promote research and innovation, and rehabilitate/develop physical
infrastructure. With respect to human resource development, the NDS lays out a broad program
for strengthening pre-school, secondary and vocational education, increasing access to health
services, and improving the quality of services provided. Because the poverty rate i s highest
among households headed by those without primary education, the NDS the emphasis human
resource development is fully warranted. Improving social safety nets by better targeting also
figures prominently in the Government's strategy. The NDS also seeks to move closer to
European integration by adjusting national policies so that they are more closely aligned with
Europeannorms.

25.     Consistent with the EGPRSP and the EU-Moldova Action Plan, the NDS i s constructed
around five medium-termcross-sectoral priorities (with macroeconomic stability and improved
public administration capacity viewed as prerequisites for the achievement o fthese priorities):
        Strengthening democracy based on the rule of law and respect for human rights
       principles. This pillar focuses on building trust in the decision making bodies o f
        government. It aims to improve the participatory process in decision-making;
        modernizing and increasing the efficiency o f the judiciary and the police; taking further
        reforms to preventand combat corruption; and improve state border management
        Settlement of Transnistrian conflict and reintegration of the country. The reintegration o f
        the country has always been a high priority o f the Government, This pillar seeks to
        address both the political and economic dimensions o f the problem by promoting the
        development o f stronger civil society linkages, demilitarization, and creating the
        conditions for further economic cooperation between the two banks o f the Nistru by
        eliminating barriersto commerce.
        Enhancing competitiveness of the national economy. Covering a number o f cross-cutting
        issues, this pillar focuses on policies to improve the business environment so as to
        encourage more investment activity, technological innovation and modernization;
        promote the expansion o f the SME sector; increase labor productivity; improve state asset
        management; address Moldova's deteriorating physical infrastructure; and, reduce its
        energy vulnerability.
        Human resource development, enhancing employment and promoting social inclusion.
        Policies under this pillar seek to improve the quality and access to education services as
        well as the efficiency o f public spending on education; enhance the quality of health
        services through further infrastructure optimization and expanding the coverage o f health
        insurance; promote the efficiency o f the labor market, including efforts to reduce
        discrimination; enhance the efficiency and targeting o f social assistance; and strengthen
        the financial stability o fthe pensionsystem.
        Regional development, With most o f Moldova's poor residing in the rural areas, this
        pillar seeks to promote the development o f small towns as "poles o f growth"; enhance the
        performance o f the agricultural sector; increase investment in rural infrastructure; and,
        improve the policy framework inthe area o f the environment and natural resource use.

26.     The NDS builds upon the institutional framework for monitoring and evaluation
developed under the EGPRSP. It develops a comprehensive results framework by including a
number o f key targets and indicators. In particular, the NDS lays out country-specific
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) with targets to be achieved within the NDS
implementation period. As noted in the Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN), the large number of
indicators presented inthe NDS will likely stretch the capacity o f the Government to collect and
analyze the data and highlights the need for further prioritization o f these monitoring indicators.

27.     Inaddition to the monitoring and evaluation framework, the JSAN highlighted the need
to continue strengthening the capacity o f the line ministries to develop and implement actions
plans and integrate these plans inthe medium-termexpenditure framework. Staffs recommended
that greater emphasis be placed on the needto develop robust civil service management capacity;
continue efforts to reduce administrative and regulatory barriers since Moldova i s falling behind
on a number o f indicators o f competitiveness; accelerate efforts to halt the deterioration of

 physical infrastructure; and continue education and health reforms since a competitive labor
 force is key to future development and the attainment of the MDGs.

 28.      Table 4 illustrates the broad consistency between the NDS, the EGPRSP, EU-Moldova

 29.      The PRSC program is supporting the Government's NDS. The PRSC2 is reinforcing
 measures to improve the business environment, promote the development of agricultural
 markets, and facilitate greater international trade. In view of the macroeconomic risks and
 vulnerabilities faced by Moldova, the PRSC2 i s also helping to promote energy efficiency and
 strengthen the targeting efficiency of the social assistance system. The next section discussed
 the components, and implementation progress, of the PRSCprogram more fully.

                           A. OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE OFTHE PRSCPROGRAM

 30.      The 2004 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) opened the possibility of the move to a
 High Case lending scenario provided that the Government ownership ofthe reform program was
 demonstrated in a good implementation track record. Over the 2004-2006 period, the
 Government was able to demonstrate a track record of reform by fully or substantially meeting
 most of the reform benchmarks established under the CAS. Achievement of these benchmarks
 unlocked the provision of financing under the PRSC instrument.

 31.      The PRSC program takes forward the reform agenda previously measured under the
 high-case triggers and is aligned with key elements of the reform agenda as articulated in the
 Government's first and second PRSPs (the EGPRSP and NDS). Cooperating closely with other
 donors, the program provides the opportunity to explicitly support structural reforms needed to
 promote improved governance, deliver sustained inclusive growth and to manage vulnerabilities.
 The PRSCprogram has also increasedthe certainty of resourceflows to the Government.

Assessment of results to date under the PRSCprogram (PRSCl and PRSC2)

32.     The first PRSC was approved by the Board on October 19,2006 and became effective on
March 20, 2007. The credit is fully disbursed.All actions requiredfor Board approval were fully
met. Over the period of reforms supported by the PRSC program, macroeconomic gains have
beenlargely sustainedand prudent fiscal and monetary policies have beenmaintained. The gains
have created the conditions and the resources for the successful pursuit of structural reforms. In
addition to moving its institutional and legal framework closer to international and European
norms, the reform effort in Moldova has begun to produce concrete results on the ground. The
results achievedunder the three PRSC program pillars are summarized below (and inAnnex 3).

33.     Under the first pillar of the PRSC program, Improving the Investment Climate, the
Government has undertaken a systematic review of country's normative acts (so-called
Guillotine 1 exercise), with the objective to modify or remove by-laws that create unwarranted
obstacles to business operations. At the same time, the Parliament has adopted a framework law
(Law 235), laying down the principles of regulating entrepreneurial activities by public
authorities. Businessregistrationprocedures have beensimplified and average firm licensing and
authorization costs have declined from 54 to 38 percent of per capita GDP. Nevertheless,
numerous surveys, includingthe World Bank's Doing Business, highlight the need to accelerate
this reform process. The Government efforts directed at improving trade facilitation are also
beginning to bear fruit. The number of physical inspections and average clearance times at
customs have improved with clearance times dropping from an average o f 471 minutes to 120
minutes, while the physical inspection rate has dropped inhalf-to around 50%. It is recognized
that reform efforts started under PRSCl will take time to bear h i t and that these efforts are
being deepened and continued under PRSC2. There are, however, signs that private sector
confidence in the economy is growing with private investment increasing from 14 percent of
GDP in2003 to over 22 percent in2007. Foreign confidence inthe economy has also grown with
FDI accelerating from 3 percent of GDP in 2003-2004 to an estimated 10 percent of GDP in
2007. Developments in the financial system also point to growing confidence in the economy
with deposits as a share of GDP doubling since 2003.

34.     The Government has taken steps to liberalize agricultural exports by making use of the
Universal Commodities Exchange voluntary. However, the drought in mid- 2007 moved
Moldova from a net exporter of food to a net importer. The Government's policy response
favored domestic food consumers and, thus, for some key crops (what maize, sunflowers)
domestic farmers still receive lower prices domestically compared to international parity prices
through the first part of 2007. While the Government reducedthe testing times requiredfor seed
imports, these measures have not yet proved adequate to stimulate the formal importationof new
seed varieties. Similarly, the government has started developing a market information system,
but muchneedprice informationoften doesn't reachfarmers ina timely or frequent fashion.

35.     Under the second pillar of the PRSC program, the Government has also pursuedreforms
aimed at Improving the Efficiency and Management of Public Sector Resources. The
Government set out an ambitious reform agenda aimed at modernizing its civil service to
European standards. While only 30 percent of new civil servants were appointed through a
competitive merit basis in 2007, the adoption of civil service law should accelerate this trend.
The Government has also taken steps aimed at addressing the problem of low pay in the civil


                                               11

service and increasing the transparency and equity o f civil service remuneration system. Civil
servant salaries have increased, while still preserving the prudent fiscal stance, and the base
component o f pay has increased from 25 to 50 percent to total remuneration. The development o f
a new civil service wage system, though delayed, i s underway. The establishment o f policy
analysis and coordination units has helped strengthen the linkages between the Government's
policy priorities and the budgetaryprocess.

36.     The Government has also taken steps to further the restructuring o f the farm sector.
While the government reintroduced a 5 hectare requirement for vineyards, for other farm
products the size and ownership restrictions on access to subsidies and support programs have
been largely eliminated. Still, the share agriculture subsidies going to peasant farms has
remained small (12% o f total), with much o f the aid under the Government's drought relief
efforts going to larger, corporate farms. Similarly, the drought delayed the Government's efforts
to shift spending away from recurrent spendingtoward investments.

37.     Recognition o f the importance o f the need to halt the deterioration in Moldovan
transportation infrastructure has led to a significant increase road maintenance financing. The
approved land transportation strategy provides for a sizeable increase in road maintenance
spending(fundedby the fuel excise tax) starting in2009. Efforts to optimize the school network
have started to gain momentum. A draft education optimization strategy i s currently being
discussed with stakeholders and will be piloted in two rayons in the coming school year.
Spending on primary health care has increased to 30 percent o f total health care spending and
with procedure for direct contracting with primary health care centers now inplace, it is expect
that 25 percent o f rayon level primary health care centers (i.e. 9 out o f 35) will be managed by
competitively selected managers. Public procurement has been made more competitive, with a
significant drop in the number and value o f public procurement contracts awarded using sole
source (from 45 to 8.9 percent o f contracts) and a steady increase in the number and value o f
contracts awarded through open tendering(from 19 to 70.4 percent o f contracts).

38.     Under the final pillar of the PRSC program, Strengthening Social Protection Systems,
the Government has taken steps towards completing the pension reform program launched in
1999. Individual records for all know pension contributors (outside individual farmers) have
been now been inputted. However, the current database includes data on calculated or expected
contributions and not on actual contributions. This has complicated efforts to pay pensions based
on actual contributions paid as opposed to earning. The Government has moved faster than
expected in reforming the targeting o f its social assistance program. Parliament i s expected to
adopt the new Law on Social Assistance with the Ministry o f Social Protection issuing
regulations that describe the proxy-means targeting method, a more efficient method to ensure
that public resources reach the poor.


                    B.COLLABORATIONWITHTHE IMFAND OTHER DONORS

39.     IDA partnership with the IMF in supporting Moldova's development strategy has been
excellent over the past few years. Bank and IMF staffs have executed joint work and have
continued to carry out joint missions at least twice a year for macroeconomic policy dialogue
with the Government. The IMF policy dialogue with the Government takes place inthe context
o f the ongoing Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), covering the 2006-2008 period.


                                                12

  The PRSC2 has been prepared in conjunction with the PRGF to ensure the consistency of the
  macroeconomic and structural policy reforms supportedby bothprograms. The IMF is taking the
  lead on macroeconomic issues while IDA takes the lead on structural and social issues. In a
  number of areas where the mandates of the two institutions overlap, such as public finance, the
  work is being closely coordinated to ensure that consistent advice is provided to the authorities.
  The existence of an IMF program i s an important input for the determination of the adequacy of
  the macroeconomic policy framework.

  40.       Donor support plays an important role in supporting the implementation o f the EGPRSP
  and PRSC programs. Coordination betweenIDA, the UnitedKingdom (DFID), Sweden(SIDA),
  and the Netherlands has beenespecially strong since all these donors have beencollaborating in
  the preparation of the policy framework supported by the PRSC program. Both UK and Dutch
  Governments have provided cofinancing (in excess of $6 million) to the first PRSC. The PRSC
  program was catalytic instarting improved donor harmonization inMoldova. During PRSC1 and
  PRSC2 preparation process, DFID, SIDA, and IDA carried out joint missions in consultation
  with the European Union. This harmonization process was carried forward through a
  Development Partnership Framework signed between the Government, IDA, the Netherlands,
  the United Kingdom (DFID), Sweden (SIDA), the UN, IMF, EU and others entitled "Co-
  ordination and Harmonization of Government and Donor Practices for Aid Effectiveness in the
  Republic of Moldova" signed in Chisinau on May 29, 2006. This Partnership Framework
  commits the parties to joint reviews, harmonization of indicators, and prior actions and
  synchronization with Government budget cycles with a view to reducing transaction costs of
  assistance to the Government.

          c.ANALYTICALUNDERPINNINGSANDRELATIONSHIP                    TO OTHERBANKOPERATIONS5

 41.        Analytical Work, The PRSC programmatic series rests on a wide program of analytic
 work carried out by the Government, the Bank, and other donors that have helped inform the
 program's design. The studies underline the need to change the quality of growth in Moldova,
 moving away from the current consumption-led, remittance-fueled growth paradigm. They
 highlight the need to raise domestic productivity, particularly in the agricultural sector, by
  improving the business environment so as to encourage greater investment and innovation as the
 most direct means to accelerate growth and reduce poverty inMoldova. This body o f analytical
 work also examines public expenditures in the social sectors - education, health, social
 assistance, and pensions - and highlights the need to improve the strategic allocation of public
resources by increasing efficiency of spending so as to free public resources to increase much
neededpublic investment and ensure that targeted social safety nets are adequately funded. The
 studies also underscore the need to establish a modern and efficient public administration,
necessary inorder to achieve the country's longer-term development outcomes.

42.         Bank Operations. The PRSC program remains the main instrument o f the Bank for
providing support to the implementation of the NDS. The complementarity of efforts between
programmatic support under the PRSC program and investment lending is key to making
efficient use of Bank resources. A number of investment projects support institutional reforms

and capacity building to help the government realize its vision o f a private sector led economy.
These investment projects promote reforms in the areas o f business environment, trade
facilitation and the agricultural and rural sectors. The Bank also supports a number o f projects
aimed at improving the efficiency of public sector resource use including more effective and
transparent management o f public finances as well as broader public administration reform
efforts. Bank operations have also focused on improving resource use in specific sectors,
including water, sanitation and road infrastructure. Inthe social sectors, Bank support i s provided
inthe context ofsocial development programs inhealth, education, and social protection as well
as support the government in scaling up efforts to improve the targeting efficiency o f social
assistance programs.



                                      D.LESSONSLEARNED

43.     The formulation o f the second PRSC draws on lessons learned from the Government's
implementation o f the first PRSC,previous development policy operations and the overall IDA
support to the reform process in Moldova. Recent policy dialogue between IDA and the
Government o f Moldova has had a strong public sector reform and governance content. These
issues form the overarching reform areas encompassed by the PRSC-supportedreform program.

44.     The following four lessons have beenderivedand applied to this PRSC2:


0   Government ownership is key. The anchoring o f the first PRSC in the EGPRSP (the pre-
   cursor to the NDS) was essential to the progress that was achieved.          PRSC2 takes this
    forward by remaining anchored in the Government national development strategy and the
   various sectoral strategies. This ensures the consistency o f the reform program and
   strengthensits irreversibility.
0  Programflexibility is important. External shocks and weaknesses inprogram implementation
   mean that the sequence, speed and implementation o f reforms may change. The PRSC
   program needs to be flexible to that eventuality. This i s reflected in the modification to a
   numberof anticipatedtriggers and benchmarks that are proposedinthis program document.
0  Donor coordination strengthens program performance. The PRSC program was prepared in
   parallel to the IMF's PRGF program and many o f the actions supported by these programs
   are complementary. The Bank has maintained close coordination with the IMF. The PRSCl
   was cofinanced by DFID and the Dutch government and has beenextensively discussed with
   the EUinthe context o fthe EUMoldova Action plan. Staffs from these have participated in
   joint discussions with Government around the common PRSC program policy framework.
   This coordination has allowed donors to respond more effectively to the needs o f
   Government &e. for technical assistance) and by better harmonizing the various assistance
   programs has reducedthe transaction costs imposed on Government.
0  Resultsframework is important. Focusing on results makes it easier to take full stock o f what
   has been achieved during program implementation particularly if policy performance i s
   uneven. Towards this end, developing a good set of indicators facilitates the assessment o f
   progress, helps with policy dialogue and allows for appropriate adjustment in program
   triggers and benchmarks.

Box 1. GoodPractice Principles on Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership.

The PRSC program is based on the Government's own reform program as articulatedin the Government's Poverty
Reduction Strategy (the EGPRSPand NDS) and the EU-Moldova Action plan. These PRSPs benefited from a broad
based participationprocess aimed at developing consensus behindthe reform program. Under the PRSC program, a
number of sector strategies have been developed, in concert with stakeholders and other donors, and the PRSC
program relies on measures derived from these strategies which have also been endorsed in the NDS. Analytical
work undertaken with support of the Bank and other donor partner (i.e. the PER, and PEFA), has assisted the
Government in the formulation of policy. With regards the political economy of reform, on sensitive issues, such as
the optimization of the school network, the approach taken by the PRSC series has been to encourage the
Government to undertake consultationwith interested stakeholders as it develops it sector strategy so as to ensure
broad ownership ofthe strategy.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework.

The Bank's support is summarized in an agreed policy matrix (and adopted by the Cabinet) which outlines actions
over the medium term with clear and well defined outcome goals, The First Deputy Prime Minister coordinates the
program for the Government and assigns specific responsibilityfor implementing and monitoring the program to
various Government agencies. This is supplemented by the monitoring and evaluation efforts of the Government
apparatus itself. Sustaineddiscussions andjoint staff visits with donors that are providing budget or macroeconomic
support (the European Commission, IMF, DFID, SIDA and the Dutch Governments) are helping improve the
alignment of support to Moldova's reform program. This harmonizationprocess has been carried forward through a
DevelopmentPartnershipFramework signedby the Governmentand key donor partners. A number ofthese partners
have financing technical assistance to support the design and implementationof the reform programand DFID and
the DutchGovernment have providedsignificantcofinancingfor the PRSC program.

Principle 3. Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances.

The cross-cutting reform program supported by the PRSC program is based on and part o f the Government's own
development strategy (as articulated in the EGPRSP, NDS and EU-Moldova Action Plan). It reflects the key
structural reformsneededto align Moldova's institutionscloser to EU norms, to complete the country's transition to
a well-functioning market based economy and develop the domestic sources o f sustained economic growth and
poverty reduction. The budget support provided under the PRSC series aims to be disbursed early in Moldova's
fiscal year. The sensitive policy reforms includedin the PRSC program (civil service, education, pensionand social
assistance reform) reflect the Government's objectives as states in its poverty reduction strategy and comprise a
subset of reform already under implementationby the Government. As part of its broader reform program aimed at
eventual EU integration, the subset of reforms supported by the PRSC program has broad support across the
political spectrum. A wide range of analytical work including PSIAs, done in collaboration with the Government,
underpinsthe reformagenda and policy choices.

Principle 4. Choose only actions critical for achieving resultsas conditions for disbursement.

The PRSC program focuses on actions that are deemed critical in terms of achievingthe overarching development
objectives. The prior actions and conditions are drawn from the Government's own policy framework and the
resultingpolicy matrix is agreed with the Government. Where the Government's policy framework is weak or non
existent (Le. civil service, education and transportation), the PRSC program sequences reform measures, first
supporting the Government's efforts to develop a sector strategy and then a reform action plan. The first PRSC
consisted of 9 triggers (the CAS High Case benchmarks) and 7 benchmarks.The proposedsecond PRSC consists of
7 triggers and 17 benchmarks.

Principle 5. Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support.

 Progressmade with implementation of reforms and achievemento f outcome goals is monitored on a regular basis,
 both under the PRSC program rubric as well as other associated Bank investment operation. The Government,
 drawing upon inputs from the various ministries and agencies, preparesa bi-monthlyprogressmatrixwhich outlines
 the status of reforms and outcomes indicators. The proposedPRSC2 lending volume, includingDonor cofinancing,

                                       A.       OVERALL    DESCRIPTION

 45.      The objective of the proposed second PRSC is to support the Government's anti-poverty
 strategy (as articulated in the EGPRSP, the NDS and the EU-Moldova action plan). The
 Government is pursuing a comprehensive development strategy focusing on accelerating
 Moldova's transition from a command to a market-based, private sector-led, economy; from an
 economy largely dependent on agriculture to one based on manufacturing and services (both in
 the urban and rural areas). Towards this end, the Government is promoting improvements inthe
 quality of governance and strengthening the efficiency of public expenditures and public
 administration.

 46.      The proposed second PRSC - largely unchanged from the first PRSC                      -selectively
 supports those areas of the Government strategy where the sustainability of the key reforms
 requires consolidation, prioritization, cross-cutting support, and deepening to make real progress
 on the growth and poverty reduction agenda:

     1. Improving the Investment Climate, through key policy actions to improve the investment
          climate and foster a more competitive enterprise and farming sector.

     2. Improving the Eficiency and Management of Public Resources, by helping the
          government build a meritocratic civil service, improve the strategic allocation of public
          finances, improve the efficiency o f public resource use thereby yielding increased fiscal
          space for more public investment spending without crowding out the private sector.

     3.   Strengthening Pension and Social Assistance Systems by supporting further reforms to
          pension and social assistance systems, including better targeting of vulnerable groups by
          these programs.

 Pillar I: Improvingthe InvestmentClimate

 47.      This pillar of the PRSC program seeks to help Moldova confront business environment
 challenges to economic growth identified in the NDS by focusing on the critical areas of
 regulatory and administrative barriers, trade facilitation, the development of agricultural markets
 andreducing energy vulnerability.
A.        Reducing Regulatory andAdministrative Costs of Business Regulations

 48.       During the last few years the Government has launched a comprehensive effort to
 improve the business environment by establishing the framework and priorities for implementing
 regulatory reform, including curbing business inspections, simplifying business licenses and tax
 administration, and limiting mandatory reporting for statistical purposes. With support under
 PRSC1, the Government has undertaken a comprehensive review o f executive regulations (by-
 laws) and eliminated those regulations that were no longer needed or did not have legal basis.
 Despite these efforts, further deregulation i s needed to make Moldova's economy more
 competitive and more attractive for local and foreign investors, as reflected in the country's




                                                         18

standing in Bank's DB reports6The NDS recognizes the importance of: (i) streamlining         further
of business registration, and post-registration procedures of issuing permits, licenses and similar
documents; (ii)continuing of the process of reducing the number of state controls and
inspections; and (iii)increasing the efficiency of paid regulatory services offered by public
authorities, by setting fees for these services at cost recovering levels or providing services for
free whenever there are no additional costs.

49.      The Government implementedthe transitional provisions of the Law on Basic Principles
and Mechanisms of State Regulation of Business Activity (Law 235) through the adoption o f
Government decision No. 690, dated June 18, 2007 and submission to Parliament of a draft law
covering amendments to 80 laws. This second phase of the regulatory "Guillotine" entailed a
comprehensive review of legislative acts affecting business entry, exit and operations.
Underscoring the importance placed on this effort, Parliament establisheda special commission,
assisted by independent experts and the Business Advisory Board to review and extend this
reform effort. Two legislative packages - Law 280, covering amendments to some 80 laws
proposed by the Government; and Law 281, covering additional amendments to a number o f
laws proposed by Parliament (at Speaker's initiative), including crucial amendments to Law on
Licensing - have been approved by Parliament in December 2007 and sent for promulgation to
Presidential Administration.. Starting with January 2008, Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA)
has becomemandatory for all new regulations affecting business.

50.      PRSC3 would further support the Government's efforts to improve the business enabling
environment by strengthening the legal and institutional framework for protection o f
competition, The National Agency for Protection of Competition (NAPC) was established in
February 2007 and has now become fully operational. The very first actions by NAPC, however,
have revealed that the framework law on protection of competition, passed in 2001, requires
substantial amendments in order to bring it closer to Moldova's changed economic realities and
EUgood practices. With TA provided by the Bank, the authorities are now working on a set of
amendments to the law aimed at: (i)providing clearer definitions of various types of unfair
competition by market participants; and (ii)clarifying the powers of NAPC in enforcing fair
competition. Following extensive public consultation process, currently underway, these
amendmentsare expectedto be enactedby Parliament by mid-2008.


B.      Improving TradeFacilitation

5 1.     Inefficient and costly border procedures exacted a significant cost on businesses,
undermine export competitiveness, making the country less attractive to foreign investment,and
reducedthe ability of domestic firms to participate inglobal production networks. The Moldova
Customs Service (MCS) has significantly improved its performance over the past several years,
aligning legislation and regulations to EU standards, as well as automating the Customs
declaration processing in the course of implementing ASYCUDA-World as well as establishing


  In Doing Business 2008, Moldova's overall global standing on the ease of doing business has declined compared
to the past year, slipping from 90th to 92nd. Although the decline is relative, reflectingthe fast pace of reforms in
other economies and the expanded coverage of the report, the deteriorationis also due to remaining inefficienciesin
Moldova's business environment, particularly in the field o f construction licenses and permits. The report also
makes note of Moldova's recent progresswith implementationof regulatoryreform, which due to the timing of the
reporthas not been fully reflectedinthe Doing Businessrankings.


                                                        19

a dedicated risk analysis and post release audit units. This has contributed to the simplification
and rationalization o f procedures while increasing compliance by the business community. The
MCS has established a system for collecting Customs border and clearance performance
indicators and reporting, previously maintained underthe TTFSE project.

52.      Under PRSC3 the number o f control agencies at the border will be reduced in line with
EU practice. There are currently up to nine agencies present at border crossing points. It is
estimated that one-third o f the border entry processing time i s rightly attributed to the Customs
Service, another one-third i s taken by the other agencies that are present at the border (often just
to collect fees). A significant portion o f the remaining time reflects the poor organization o f
traffic flows resulting from the high number o f agencies present at the border. Consolidation o f
these efforts would contribute to greater efficiency and improved trade facilitation.


C.       DevelopingAgriculturalMarkets

53.      Moldovan farmers generally receive less for their outputs and pay more for their inputs
relative to international parity prices than they should. This has squeezed farmer incomes,
limited investmentinthe sector, reduced the scope for farm restructuring, and decreased returns
to factors such as land and labor. The causes for this are various policy distortions and market
imperfections that vary by sub-sector. Under PRSCl, the Government eliminated the
requirement that commodities (particularly, cereals and oilseeds) pass through the Universal
Commodities Exchange. This requirement restricted exports and contributed to a wedge between
international and farmgate prices. To better inform agricultural producers on international market
opportunities and trends incommodity prices, the Government has begundisseminating, with the
help o f agricultural NGOs, information on regional prices for cereals and oilseeds in the local
media, as a precursor to the development o f its own market information system. However,
Government has continued to demonstrate a worrying tendency to interfere in the normal
functioning o f agricultural markets, including by supporting restrictions on grain exports,
restricting exports o f bulk wine and creating a state-sanctioned monopoly for sales to Belarus,
and restricting imports o f livestock products through a cumbersome and opaque permitting
system.

54.     Under PRSC2, the Government approved an action plan - as part o f its overall agriculture
strategy - that starts the process o f liberalizing the import regime for seeds and seedlings,
improving the agricultural product standardization and certification system, and developing a
market information system to include the collection and dissemination o f information on
domestic cereal and oilseed prices. The Government also conducted a review o f the impact o f its
export market liberalization efforts, with an emphasis on cereals and oilseeds. The 2007 drought,
which destroyed a large part o f Moldova's cereal crops, complicated the analysis since Moldova
moved from being a net food exporter to a net importer. Confronted with rising cereal prices the
Government temporarily suspendedthe VAT on imported wheat. This policy action contributed
to the continued price discrimination against domestic farmers. One o f the challenges
confronting the Government inundertaking this technical price analysis on a regular basis i s the
lack o f capacity and absence o f good price data. Inaddition, the Government undertook a study
entitled "Food Security and Grain Price Stabilization". The study highlightedthe inefficiencies
and distortions stemming from Government's "cheap bread" policy. Given the way this policy
has beenimplemented, it has contributed to lower farmgate prices, financial pressures on private


                                                 20

bakeries, inefficient and non-transparent use of public resources in the operation of the state
grain reserve, and poor targeting of beneficiaries. Influenced largely by the study, the
Government prepared an "Action Plan" for reforming part of the current system of social bread
prices and the material reserve. The "Action Plan" i s positive and largely consistent with the
study, but is more a statement of principles rather than an actual action plan. The Action Plan
touches issues such as revising current operational rules for the Strategic Grain Reserve, equal
access to the grain provided for public andprivate enterprises, andthe maintaining of a favorable
trade climate for cereals.       Finally, the Government adopted a law on Savings and Credit
Associations that provided for multi-level licensing and reporting and supervisory requirements.

55.     It is clear that the agricultural sector would benefitfrom an acceleration and deepeningof
reforms in a number of these areas. Improving farmer's access to new seed varieties, and
adjusting Government seed regulations and regulatory practices toward EU practices would be
desirable. Similarly, while price information i s being provided to farmers with the help of two
local NGOs, this information is still being offered on a piecemeal basis, through a variety o f
channels that are not widely accessible to farmers (i.e. internet), are not provided with sufficient
frequency, and often only reach farmers after a long delay, Finally, concrete actions needto be
developed, agreed, and implementedto improve cereal and breadmarket policies.

56.     For PRSC3,the Government will continue implementation ofthe Action Plan, including:
scaling up of the market information system to cover all basic commodities accounting for at
least 5 percent of value of agriculture production, Dissemination will be expanded to include
radio and local newspaper, and price data will be disseminated more frequently; improving the
transparency and effectiveness of the Government grain policy, by establishing transparent rules
defining how and when the Strategic Grain Reserve should intervene (Le. define "food
emergency") and begin implementing those rules, and making public the finances of the State
GrainReserve.


D.     Reducing Energy Vulnerability

57.    Due to the near total dependence on imports in meeting its primary energy needs,
Moldova will continue to be vulnerable to energy price shocks. Natural gas prices have increased
from $80 per thousand cubic meters (mcm) in 2005 to $190 as of January 2008 and further
phased increases will take place over the next five years to reach levels comparable to those
charged to Europe. In addition, the cost of electricity imports, previously maintained at a
relatively low level by Ukraine, have also started to increase as the price o f natural gas
confronting Ukraine approaches the European parity price. Moldova has dealt with the energy
price shocks by passing the full cost of higher imported energy onto the final consumers.
Recognizing that these higher costs have poverty implications, the Government has significantly
increased transfers to households (by over 1 percentage point of GDP). Since existing transfer
mechanisms suffered from significant targeting leakages, the Government i s reforming its social
assistance program by introducing a means testing mechanism thereby allowing scarce fiscal
resourceto be more efficiently targeted at vulnerable households.

58.    Under PRSC2, a new comprehensive energy efficiency strategy was adopted that
includes measures to (i)adjust and maintain energy tariffs at full cost recovery level; (ii)
maintain the high cash collections rates for natural gas and electricity; (iii) Termocom and
                                                                              return



                                                  21

Combined Heat and Power plants to financial viability; (iv) develop incentives and other
measures to promote and facilitate investments in energy efficiency, energy savings, and
alternative (renewable) energy resources; and (v) improve institutional capacity in the
government and ANRE for contingency planning and rapid response to an uncertain evolution of
energyprices inthe medium-term.

59.     Under PRSC3, the Government will enact a new energy law and start implementingnew
market rules that would provide solutions to: (i)     cross-border electricity trade and congestion
management; (ii)power system balancing and settlement; and (iii)gradual power market
opening.


Pillar 11: Improvingthe Efficiencyand Managementof PublicResources

A.      Building a Meritocratic Civil Service

60.     Moldova aspires to improve the quality o f the public administration as a measure to
deepen the impact o f the government policies and raise quality o f services to the citizens. While
Moldova has been introducing elements o f a modern civil service, there remains a significant
shortage o f highly skilled civil servants capable o f performing analytical work, developing
modem legislation, and providing high quality policy advice to the policy-making officials.
Raising civil service professionalism in Moldova will require improved civil service training,
performance management, and adequate incentives. It i s also important to establish sound legal
protection for unbiased performance o f the civil service duty as required by law, without
interference and undue influence. Under PRSCZ, The Government o f Moldova has adopted a
Strategy o f Central Public Administration Reform which set out an ambitious agenda aimed at
modernizing its civil service to European standards. Competitive merit based recruitment and a
sound system o f remuneration lie at the core o f the civil service reform.

61.     The draft civil service law that was adopted by Government and submitted to Parliament
establishes merit principles in recruitment, defines responsibilities to act in accordance with the
law, obligations to raise professionalism, and rights for legal and social protections o f civil
servants. During drafting, the Government sought inputs from various internal and external
stakeholders. The draft civil service law was been examined by SIGMA/OECD to ensure the
compatibility with EU standards on professional civil service. Final approval o f the draft law i s
expected to take place by mid-year.

62.     Under PRSC3, following the approval o f the law, the government will adopt regulations
and secondary legislation required for implementation o f the new law. This includes: adopting
regulation on classification and grading o f civil service posts; approving a regulation on the
Automated CS Register; and revising and approving procedures for competitive recruitment. A
newcivil service register is currently beingdesignedand will be usedas a tool for monitoring o f
competitive hiring and promotions. The responsibility for the central civil service management
function will be assigned to the Government Office.




                                                 22

B.      Implementing a Transparentand Uniform RemunerationSystem

63.     L o w public sector wages makes it difficult to attract and retain skilled civil servants,
particularly for those positions that require new public management skills. Under PRSCl the
Government began increasing basic salaries for civil servants. The public sector system o f
remuneration still suffers from a number o f unresolved problems: high pay compression; high
share o f additional payments (base pay i s less than 50 percent o f take home pay); weak guidance
for managers on how to implement performance related benefits; and a lack o f a central payroll
database across the various ministriedagencies. As increments between the salary grades are
very small, remuneration does not play a role incareer motivation. The difficulty o f introducing
a modern motivating pay system in the civil service stems from an ineffective system o f job
classifications and absence o f an analytical basis to establish equitable pay. The factors
determining the size o f remuneration for civil service jobs are not defined. This prevents the
decision on salary levels from using sound analytical basis, giving rise to perceptions of
imbalance betweenthe pay andjob demands and obligations.

64.     The Government has started to develop a modern and efficient system o f classification o f
the civil service posts, including criteria for assessment o f posts against a system o f criteria
characterizing the job (e.g., required level o f knowledge and skills, managerial and decision-
making responsibility, the value o f job outputs, etc.). Further, the Civil Service Law that was
submitted to Parliament defines the scope o f the civil service to cover permanent administrative
positions inthe public administration.

65.     Under PRSC3, the Ministry of Economy and Commerce in cooperation with the civil
service management body, will complete drafting civil service classification and grading system
based on revisedjob descriptions; develop (amend existing) legislation which introduces new
affordable, transparent, and uniform pay system for civil servants. Responsible line ministries
and institutions will develop and adopt a public employment action plans which aim at
improving pay conditions in the public service while gradually optimizing the structure o f the
public employment to better match government programs. Concurrently, the Government Office
initiated a process o f strategic planning in line ministries which envisages that medium-tern
strategies, aligned with the National Development Strategy, will inform institutional
restructuring and better allocation o f staff. Indirectly, the work o f NDS will support more
strategic sector policy planning, which will lay the basis for employment rightsizing.



C.      Improving theStrategicAllocation of Public Resources

66.     Allocating public resources to policy priorities to achieve decisive impacts with
government programs i s the hallmark o f efficient governments. Towards this end, Moldova has
been strengthening its resource allocation processes by expanding the coverage o f sectors
included in the MTEF. A project identification form database to enable better prioritization,
preparation and appraisal o f public investment projects has been introduced. These efforts have
contributed to better public expenditure planning, thereby facilitating the more effective
allocation o f resources to meet stated policy objectives.

67.     The Government has strengthened the central policy coordination capacity to facilitate
agreement on the policy priority framework early inthe MTEF process by establishing a central

                                                  23

policy unit in the Government Apparatus reporting directly to the Cabinet of Ministers. In
addition, policy units have been established in eleven key line ministries and will soon be
established in all the remaining ministries. While policy coordination capacity in the
Government Apparatus will take time to develop (with the support provided under the Multi-
Donor Trust Fund), the Ministry of Economy and Trade in coordination with the central policy
unit and the Ministry of Finance has beenleading the work with line ministries to improve result
focus of government programs and improve realism of planning by imposing budget constraints.

68.     By PRSC3, the central policy unit, in coordination with the Ministry of Economy and
Trade, is expected to prepare a proposal on policy framework - based on the NDS - to be
approved by the Cabinet of Ministers as a guiding document for MTEF. As the capacity of the
Central Policy Coordination unit inthe Government Office reaches adequate level, this unit will
provide strategic and day to day support to the Government policy decision-making, as well as
will contribute to the national development planning process. The Government will continue
implementing the project identification database for sector investment priorities.

C.RestructuringPublic Expenditures
69.     Since 2000, the Government has placed a heavy emphasis on increasing social spending-
pensions, social assistance, education, and health spending comprise over 65 percent of total
general government expenditures. With fiscal resources scarce, improving the efficiency and
targeting of social spending, particularly in the education and health sector, will be required if
the Government is to achieve the growth andpoverty reduction objectives ofthe NDS.Sustained
economic growth will also requiremore pro-growth public investment spending, particularly on
the transportation infrastructure, and an improved allocation of agriculture spending to enhance
long runcapacity inthat sector.

C.1Agricultural Spending
70.     Approximately 50 percent of agricultural land being used by large, corporate farms that
are largely unreformed since the Soviet collective farm period. While these corporate farms are
less efficient than individual (peasant) farms, the Government has channeled the majority o f
Agricultural public expenditures and subsidies to these large farms. To facilitate continued farm
restructuring, the PRSC program has supported the Government's efforts to create a level
playing field for individual farms. At the same time, the PRSC program has supported the
Government's efforts to redirect inefficient spending on recurrent subsidies towards growth
enhancing public services and investments - such as development of standards, research,
extension, agricultural education and training, and investment inmarket infrastructure required
                                                                                        -
to increasethe competitiveness of the new class of independentfamily farmers.

71.     While, under PRSCl the Government refrainedfrom providing any debt relief targeted at
agricultural enterprises/producers, as part of its wider corporate tax reform effort, the
Government wrote off all tax debts for all economic agents as of January 1, 2007. The
Government also removed all restrictions on access to subsidies and supports based on farm
ownership structure or size -an important step towards reducing the spending bias towards large
farms, increasing opportunities for individual farms, and further promoting farm restructuring. In
recent months, however, the Government reintroduced a minimum 5 hectares farm size
requirementfor vineyards subsidies.




                                                24

72.     The Government was to begin restructuring agriculture expenditures by significantly
increasing expenditure on growth-enhancing services (as a percentage o f total agriculture
expenditures) and reducing the corresponding share o f subsidies. Further, withinthe diminishing
expenditure share for subsidies, priority was to be givento measures that demonstrably enhance
the long-run productive capacity o fthe sector by supporting the creation o f long-lived assets, for
example, new vineyards, orchards, new genetic livestock strains, etc. The share o f purely
recurrent subsidies, such as product or input subsidies, was to be correspondingly reduced.

73.     However, the Government's urgent response to the 2007 drought led the Government to
deviate from its intended objective o f reallocating these expenditures. Responding to political
pressure, the government passed a mid-year budget amendment allocating an additional 200
million lei to support the agriculture sector (i.e. to finance the purchase o f destroyed seeding
materials, pay for electrical power for irrigation, fuel, fertilizer etc.). For the most part, these
additional expenditures were directed to existing beneficiaries and as a result, most individual
(peasant) farms did not receive needed public assistance (though a sizable amount o f direct
foreign assistance - both incash and inkind - was made available to these farmers). As a result,
in 2007, Agricultural subsidies in general and recurrent subsidies in particular, increased in
share. The 2008 budget, which was approved at the end o f last year, substantially increases the
share o f spending going to services and investment subsidies, putting the Government back on
track towards meetingthe PRSC program outcome indicators.

74.     The Government also undertook an evaluation o f the existing anti-hail rocket system.
While the evaluation did not result in a change in expenditure policy, the recently developed
Agricultural Sector strategy revealed the Government's intention to explore other risk mitigation
measures. Further, the Government has completed a study on streamlining and modernizing the
agricultural research, training, and education system. The adoption o f an action plan, will follow
extensiveconsultations with other stakeholders, including the Public Academy o f Sciences.

75.     For PRSC3, the government will continue reallocating agricultural expenditures (in any
FYO8 mid-year budget amendments and in the preparation of the FY09 budget) to growth
enhancing measures. It will also finalize and begin implementingthe Action Plan to streamline
and modernize the agricultural research, training and education system. The Government will
increase the share of subsidies going to individual (peasant and household) farms, with the
objective o f increasing by at least 5 percentage points each year (assuming sufficient
applications). It will also collect data on beneficiaries o f subsidies (including VAT output, MTS,
and vineyard) by farm type and farm size.

C.2 Transportation Infrastructure
76.    The rapid deterioration of Moldova's transportation infrastructure over the transition
period has significantly increased the cost and reduced the quality o f transportation services with
a particularly strong impact on the country's poor. Recent annual budgets for road maintenance
representonly a small fraction o fthe expendituresneededto prevent further deterioration.

77.    The Government has prepared and adopted ahead o f schedule a Land Infrastructure
Transportation Strategy that includes reform o f road financing, introduction o f participation o f
road users in the oversight o f road maintenance financing, and increased competition in the
execution o f road maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation contracts. With financial support o f the
Bank, EBRD and EIB, the Government's road program has been launched and a significant


                                                 25

increase in resources i s being directed towards road maintenance. Starting in 2009, some 80
percent o f the fuel excise tax will be channeled into road maintenance. This percentage i s
scheduled to increase to 100 percent in subsequent years. In the 2008 budget, spending on road
maintenance, reconstruction and capital repairs will amount to $58 million.

78.     Under PRSC3 the amount allocated in the National Budget for Road Maintenance and
transferred to the Road Maintenance Fundwill represent at least MDL450 million in 2009 (with
an upward trend inthe years to come). This will be ensured at the initial stage (2009) through the
allocation o f equivalent o f 80% o f revenues from the fuel excise tax to the Road Maintenance
Fund.


C.3 Spending on Education
79.     While Moldova's public spending on education is comparable to OECD and upper-
middle income countries, there are a number o f inefficiencies and inequities confronting this
sector. Interms o f access, Moldova i s lagging behind many o f its neighbors. Inequities between
income groups are pronounced, with the problem even more pronounced if one makes the
distinction between urban and rural students. Inefficiencies, mainly resulting from the slow
adaptation o f education expenditures and norms to changing demographics, are reflected in the
fall in average pupilkeacher ratios over recent years. A continuing anomaly in Moldova's
education system is the large numbero f non-teaching relative to teaching staff.

80.     The Government prepared a draft strategy to optimize school networks that identifies
schools for optimization, defines efficiency target indicators, and has plans for developing a new
funding formula. Given the challenging political dimension o f this task, the Government has
undertaken consultations with stakeholders. Preparations for piloting the strategy in the
upcoming school year have already started.

81.     For PRSC3, the Government will approve the Strategy. Optimization results will require
alignment o f the planned Decentralization Law with the revised Law o f Local Public Finance
and the Education Law. The Government will pilot implementation o f the optimization strategy
in two rayons, including the simulation o f the allocation o f school budgets under the revised
fundingformula.

C.4. Spending on Health
82.     Efforts at reforming the Moldovan health sector include closing unnecessary health
infrastructure and emphasizing more cost-efficient service delivery at primary care settings. The
reform agenda however i s still incomplete and has not yet achieved the original aims o f equitable
coverage o f the country with good quality primary care. With the launch o f mandatory public
health insurance in 2004, public health expenditures, particular those focused on primary health
case have increased sharply.

83.     The Government has increased allocation to primary care from the Health Insurance
(HIC) budget to over 30 percent. Further, procedures for the direct contracting with autonomous
primary care providers are now in place which will allow for further increases efficiency and
transparency in the health sector. Indeed, since direct contracting has been extended to all
regions in the country as o f January 1, 2008 and since 17 primary care centers are already under



                                                26

such direct contracts, the Government has already achieved the 5% target that were expected to
be achieved underPRSC3.

84.      In light o f the advancing reform agenda in this sector, the M O H has indicated that
twenty-five percent (25%) o f rayon level primary care centers (i.e,, 9 out o f 35) will be managed
by competitively-selectedmanagers. Pilot projects indicate increased patient satisfaction and an
increase in motivation and accountability as a result o f decentralized management. In addition,
there is evidence that autonomous primary health care centers have employed the flexibility
offered by such contracting arrangements to use the funds provided by the NHIC to better meet
the needs o f their catchment population. The MOH, therefore, passed a resolution to separate the
management o f primary care centers from rayonal hospitals (effective January 1,2008). Rayons
can choose among several options: have one manager for all primary care facilities, have few
facilities groupedtogether with several managers inone rayon, or direct contracting for a facility.
Under this new scheme, primary health care managers will be selected on a competitive basis.


D.       Public Procurement

85.      The Bank has been actively involved in supporting public procurement reform in
Moldova since 1997. Throughout this time a steady improvement in aspects o f public
procurement has been observed while, at the same time, a distinct deterioration in the
institutional framework has occurred.      Under PRSCl, competition for public procurement
contracts was increased with a significant drop in the number and value o f public procurement
contracts awarded using sole source and a steady increase in the number and value o f contracts
awarded through open tendering.

86.      A new Public Procurement Law was enacted that brings Public Procurement in line with
international standards and practices and addresses many o f the weaknesses identified in the
previous 1997 law. The more positive aspects concern the decentralization o f procurement
function to the spending entities, a greater degree o f separation in responsibilities within public
procurement and increased transparency. The law i s clearly oriented towards approximation o f
EUDirectives andRegulations. However, despite the positive progress there are still a number of
shortcomings. The new law has not satisfactorily addressed the institutional framework, namely
the independence of Procurement Agency. It places public procurement in the Agency for
Material Reserves, Public Procurement and Humanitarian Aid. While this agency i s itself
independent,but does not guarantee full independence o f public procurement as the Agency still
carried out other conflicting functions. Whereas the Director (responsible for material reserves
and humanitarian aid) and Deputy Director (responsible for public procurement) are both
nominated by the Prime Minister the Deputy Director still remains answerable to the Director
which does not provide nor guarantee the full independence o f the procurement function.

87.     Under PRSCS, the Government will address institutional reporting arrangements to avoid
conflict o f interest inthe public procurement supervisory function. Further, the Government has
indicated it would like to undertake a benchmarking exercise o f public procurement along the
lines o f the OECDDAC indicators. The Government will also begin undertaking its Action Plan
for implementation o f Public Procurement Law as well as the develop a medium-term Action
Plan for the development o f the public procurement function that ensures adequate staffing and
funding for the Procurement Agency.


                                                27

Pillar 111: StrengtheningPension and Social Assistance Systems

A.      CompletingPension SystemReform

88.     Although the administration o f the social insurance system has improved inrecent years,
pension reform, however, remains incomplete and the general pension law (1999) i s not being
fully implemented. To fully implement the reform program, the Government aim to: (i)
implement the contribution-based pension payment benefits; and (ii) the pension system
                                                                           unify
for all types o f pensioners (non-farmers, farmers and privileged). Toward these ends, under
PRSC1, the Government has reduced data entry back log o f individual contribution in the
computerized contribution database and developed an agricultural pensionreform strategy.

89.     Amendments to Law on the State Social Security Pension (Law 156) and Law on Public
Social Insurance System (Law 489) were adopted by Government and submitted to Parliament
clarifying that individual pension contributions are the basis for pension calculations. Inaddition,
the Government has prepareda strategy to unify the pension system for all types of pensioners
(non-farmers, farmers and privileged).

90.     Despite progress on these fronts, other measures need to be in place-such                  as
clarifications to Article 29 o f Law 489 - to ensure the proper functioning o f a Moldova's
contribution-based pension benefits system. In addition, the transition to such a system may
entail some short-term social costs as some employees, for example, may find that their
employers have not been paying their contributions fully. A mechanism i s required to facilitate
the verification o f the accuracy o f the contributions record. Furthermore, the current database
includes data on calculated contributions only; instead data on the actual contributions should be
entered into the new system to enable calculations o f pensions based on actual contributions. The
Amnesty Law that became effective at the beginning o f this year also served to weaken the
incentives to participate andcontribute to the system.

91.     Under PRSC3, the Government aims to begin paying pensions based on actual
contributions registered in the individual accounts. For this to take place, the Government will:
complete the draft strategy to unify the pension system. The strategy should address the need to
equalize benefit calculation/entitlement rules for all categories o f contributors following a period
o f transition, eliminate privileges and strengthen the link between contributions and benefits
including changing the second part o fthe benefit formula to include revaluation o f wages; amend
the Law on Public System o f Social Insurance (Law 489, Article 29) to specify that pension
benefits are basedon actual contributions paid; Adopt and submit to Parliament an amendment to
make mandatory the issuing annual statement providing summary information on individual
pension contributions to date to all individual insured contributors to ensure that accurate
information i s kept in the contribution database and that social fund contributions are properly
collected.


B.      Enhancing the Distribution Efficiency of SocialAssistanceBenefit

92.     Moldova's social assistance system today consists o f some 13 types o f cash benefits. In
light of recent and projected increases in energy and food prices, these programs needto play a


                                                28

critical role in reducing the adverse shock on the poor and the vulnerable. However, Moldova's
social assistance system suffers from poor targeting efficiency with a large part (45 percent) o f
the benefits o f these programs accruing to the non-poor. In addition, social assistance programs
are administered by several government agencies each o f which has independent beneficiary
registries and payment databases. The existing arrangements make it very difficult to assess the
overall impact and effectiveness o f social assistance programs to the government. They also
make it more difficult for the poor and the vulnerable to access social assistance programs.

93.     Given the extent o f in-kind and informal income in Moldova, any type of income
targeting i s likely to lead to substantial errors o f inclusion; thus some type o f categorical
targeting may be a necessity. Nonetheless, it i s still necessary to improve the targeting o f social
assistance programs to ensure that they are focused on the poor and the vulnerable. To improve
targeting o f social assistance programs and gain efficiency in program administration, the
Government's reform agenda focuses on: (a) developing and adopting a strategy for improved
targeting for social assistance programs; (b) undertaking a financial and impact assessment o f
social assistance programs; (c) developing and implementing an information system for
improved record keeping and information sharing; and (d) consolidating/rationalizing the
administration o f social assistance programs.

94.     The Government has approved a draft Law on Targeted Social Assistance, which
establishes the legal basis for targeting poor Moldovans. The Government has also completed the
system concept design for a unified database o f the beneficiaries o f cash-equivalent social
assistance program.

95.     Under PRSC3, the Government will develop regulations for implementation o f the Law
on Targeted Social Assistance in order to beginimplementingthe law upon promulgation. It will
also develop a computer system for the administration o f targeted poverty benefits and for the
provision o f the consolidated social assistance database (development and approval o f technical
specifications).


                            VI. OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

                         A.      POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT ANALYSIS

96.     The first PRSC endeavored to assess the likely distributional consequences of key policy
reforms, including the Government's efforts to maintain cost recovery energy tariffs by
continuing to allow full-pass through o f energy price increases and the implementation o f the
strategy for optimizing school networks. The likely poverty and social consequences o f
macroeconomic shocks-such        as the recent drought and rising international food prices-have
beena cause for concern.

97.     In light of the potential social consequences o f reform, analytical work on the social
impact o f rising energy prices, options for reform in the education sector, and mitigation
measures for easing the reform process informed the PRSC program preparation process. As the
second PRSC moves forward, the introduction o f a better targeted social assistance system for
the most vulnerable groups in the economy is a major step toward mitigating the likely social
consequences o f any policy reform, as well as the poverty consequences o f macroeconomic


                                                29

shocks more broadly. With respect to the network optimization program in the education sector,
the PRSC2 team has encouraged a more cautious approach and has supported the Government's
effort to undertake consultation on the strategy.




                   B.     IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORINGEVALUATIONAND

98.      The administration of this credit will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance. To
facilitate program implementation and the coordination of activities, the Government has
appointed an Inter-ministerial Steering Committee chaired by the First Deputy Prime Minister.
This Committee is composed of representatives of key Ministers. The Steering Committee will
be assisted by a Technical Committee comprising high level staff from various line ministries,
including the Ministries of Agriculture and Food Industries, Economy and Trade, Education,
Finance, Industry and Infrastructure, Health and Social Protection, Transportation and
Telecommunications, and the Moldova Customs Service.

99.      A multi-donor supervision effort will be aligned with the existing government-led
monitoringand evaluation system for the EGPRSP, the Moldova-EUAction Plan andthe MTEF.
The Government's PRSC program Steering Committee will be responsible for monitoring the
PRSC program and all benchmark and outcome indicators. These benchmarksand indicators can
be found in the PRSC Policy Matrix in Annex 2. The specific benchmarks and outcomes to be
monitored have been drawn from the Government's overall development program, thus
providing significant benefits in reducing transaction costs for the Government. The overall
reform effort will be reviewed by the Government inclose coordination with regular multi-donor
missions to ensure continued implementation of the program within an adequate macroeconomic
policy framework. Given satisfactory progress, Moldova's reform program will be supported by
subsequent PRSCs under the programmatic lending framework, subject to the approval of the
Board of Executive Directors.


                                   C.      FIDUCIARY    ASPECTS

100.     Public Financial Management (PFM). Strengthening public financial management i s a
Government's priority under National Development Plan 2008-2011. The priority areas o f
activity include: (i)improving public resource allocation by introducing modern budget
preparation practices; (ii)strengthening financial discipline by modernizing the treasury system
and budget execution procedures; (iii)improving public debt management to minimize debt
service costs; (iv) improving fiscal administration and increasing the effectiveness of financial
controls; (v) increasing the efficiency of budget management through introduction of an
integrated financial management informationsystem; and (vi) harmonizing the budget and fiscal
legal framework with European Union standards. The weaknesses inthe current PFM system in
Moldova are mainly due to institutional capacity issues typical for a country in transition. The
fiduciary risk assessment annex of the most recent PEFA report (2006) notes that Moldova
remains a high risk country but has good chances to improve its rating to "medium" risk
provided ongoing reforms are implementedeffectively and efficiently. The progress achieved in
the main areas o f PFMreforms andthe remaining weaknesses are summarized below.



                                                 30

101.    Budgeting. The Government has been undertaking noticeable efforts to consolidate the
budget formulation process. The remaining weaknesses inthe budgeting area include the needto
maintain adherenceto the existing budget calendar and improve expenditure planning at the line
ministrylevel linking it to sectoralpolicy priorities. Under the NDS, efforts to better link policy
priorities through the use of annual NDS action plans are underway. Further strengthening o f
budget formulation methodologies i s a component of the PFM project currently under
implementation.

102.    Internal controls over budget execution. Moldova has made important progress in
developing the national treasury system. Controls over budget execution have been significantly
strengthened through gradual expansion of the treasury coverage that started in 1997.
Weaknesses in treasury operations are largely being addressed under the PFM project through
creation of a comprehensive FMIS. Significant improvements were made in 2007 infunctioning
ofthe treasury single account, cashmanagement and forecasting.

103.    Procurement. A new public procurement law, which entered into force in October 2007,
has largely brought Moldova legislation in line with international good practices. The new law
contains some weaknesses: (i)the issue of independence of the Procurement Agency still
remains (Le. the procurement agency function will remain part of Agency for Material Reserves,
Public Procurement and Humanitarian aid responsible for procurements for State reserves); and,
(ii)the complaints procedures and mechanismsare not adequate, particularly institutional
arrangements (Le. the same Agency is responsible for complaints resolutions). Overall
procurement outcomes are favorable - the practice of single source tendering has been
significantly reducedwhile the percentage of contracts awarded using open tender procedure has
increased.

104.    Accounting and reporting. Under the PFM project, the Government i s preparing for
important changes in public sector accounting and reporting. The new integrated budget
classification and chart of accounts system i s being developed on the basis of the GFS2001
standards to be launched with the new FMIS. It i s expected that in the medium-term the
Government will maintain cash-based accounting for the treasury and modified cash based
accounting for the budget institutions. The new FMIS will enable the Government to produce
consolidated financial statements showing financial position of the Government, and not only the
budget execution reports, as is the practice at the moment.

105.    Internal auditing. The internal auditing function of the Government is still at an early
stage of its development. Small internal audit units have been established in the Ministry of
Finance (MOF), State Tax Service, Customs and National Social Insurance House. In addition,
there is a Control and Revision Service (CRS) under the Ministry of Finance. Inmost cases, the
CRS is performing ex-post verification of budget execution. Development of a modern internal
audit function withinthe Government is a component ofthe PFMproject.

106.    External auditing. Audit methodologies require further improvements despite
introduction of a number of internal manuals and guidelines. Modern audit concepts were
introduced into the Court of Accounts Law through 2005 amendmentsbut there i s still a need for
the Parliament to pay sufficient attention to the audit reports. The current system of nominating
members to the top management body of the Court of Account (COA) does not guarantee
independenceandthere is an elementofpolitical influence inthe working ofthe COA. The COA


                                                 31

has indicated its willingness to develop into a modern external audit institution. Technical
assistance is being provided by the Swedish and British national audit offices to support the
implementation of the COA's Strategic Development Plan.

107.    Reforms to strengthen the public financial management framework. Weaknesses in the
Moldovan public financial management system are well understood and a broad PFM reform
program is under way. As a result of these efforts, the credibility of the Moldova PFM
framework has beenenhanced. Major assistance i s already being provided by the Bank under the
the PFM Project, co-financed by SIDA and the Dutch Government. The PFM project i s
supporting improvements in: (i) preparation and execution; (ii)
                                  budget                                accounting and reporting;
(iii)developmentofFMISandcashmanagement;(iv) internalauditing; and, (v) PFMrelated
training. Incoordination with the PFM project, DFID is providing support to the strengthening of
the MTEF process, and TA for the Court of Accounts has been launched. Several high priority
reform measures are included in the IMF's PRGF and the proposed second PRSC (as indicated
in the sections above). The existing instruments already mobilized through a concerted multi-
donor effort appear to be sufficient to support the critical PFM agenda. No additional fiduciary
riskmitigationmeasures are considerednecessaryfor the presentPRCS2.

108.    Central Bank and Foreign Exchange Management. The IMF updated its safeguards
assessment of the NBM in 2006 and found that while the NBM has made progress in
strengthening its safeguards framework, certain weaknesses remain. To further improve the
NBM's safeguards,the updatedassessment recommended:(i) IMFprogram data compilation
                                                                the
procedures be formalized delineating responsibilities of the involved departments, and the
Internal Audit Department should include regular audits of the process inits audit plans; and (ii)
the NBM Law be amended to better align profit distribution rules with recapitalization
requirements, and formalize the financial relationship between the NBM and the Ministry of
Finance. NBM financial statements have received unqualified (clean) audit opinions from
international auditors for the past three years (2004, 2005 and 2006). Inview of this, there are no
additional fiduciary safeguards considered necessary as far as management of the foreign
exchange is concerned.

                                                       AND

109.   Disbursement and Funds flow. The proposed Credit, SDR 6.1 million (US$lO million
equivalent), will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy lending.
The Credit will be disbursedinone tranche immediately upon effectiveness and is not tiedto any
specific purchases and no procurement requirementswill be needed. The funds will be deposited
at the existing treasury USD account used for receiving support from donors and for making
external payments opened by Ministry of Finance/State Treasury with the NBM, which forms
part of the official foreign exchange reserves. If, after depositing the Credit proceeds, the
proceeds are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Credit Agreement, the Bank will
require the recipient to refund the amount directly to the Bank, cancelling an equivalent un-
disbursedamount ofthe credit.

110.   Accounts and Auditing. The administration and accounting o f the Credit proceeds will be
the responsibility of the State Treasury of the Ministryof Finance. The standard country rules
will be followed by treasury for administration and accounting. The Government will maintain



                                                 32

accounts and records, or ensure that such items are maintained, showing that credit
disbursements were in accordance with provision o f the Financing Agreement. Such accounts
and records will be maintained in a form acceptable to the Bank. The M O F will be responsible
for the PRSC2's administration and for preparing the withdrawal application. The PRSC2 will be
subject to ratification by Parliament before it becomes effective. The MOF, with the assistance o f
the NBM, will maintain records of all transactions under the PRSC2 in accordance with sound
accounting practices. Within 30 days o f the NBM being credited, the M O F will provide to the
Bank a confirmation that the amount o f the PRSC2 has been credited to an account that i s
available to finance budgeted expenditures.


                                 E.    ENVIRONMENTAL      ASPECTS

111.    The PRSC program has made an effort to assess and address the likelihood o f significant
effects o f policies supported by the program on the environment, natural resources, or forests
including assessment o f the government's systems for reducing adverse effects and enhancing
positive effects. Among the areas requiring further attention with respect to its environmental
aspects are the following policy interventions: (i)reduction o f the regulatory burden; (ii)
                                                                                          removal
o f agricultural export restrictions; and (iii)passing the full cost o f energy price increase to
customers. The PRSC program identified measures to mitigate some o f the potential adverse
consequences o f these interventions. Moreover, as the PRSC program moves forward, a number
o f ongoing projects financed by the World Bank are serving to mitigate the likely effects of
increased agricultural activity. For example, among the components o f the Bank's "Persistent
Organic Pollutants (POPS) Stockpiles Management and Destruction Project" are those aimed at
institutional strengthening, the modernization o f current legislation (i.e., those related to the
Stockholm Convention), and the introduction o f broader chemical safety approach inthe country
consistent with European Union legislation. The project also has a special activity under
Component 2 (Prevention o f new Stockpiles o f Obsolete Pesticides) that aims to provide support
in promoting best practices in Pest Management in crop production, including Integrated Pest
Management. Furthermore, the GEF "Agricultural Pollution Control Project" i s expanding the
use of environmentally-friendly agricultural practices by farmers and agricultural enterprises to
reduce nutrient discharge from agricultural sources to the Danube River and Black Sea.

112.    A specific policy area supported by PRSC2 that may have environmental effects is the
promotion of road maintenance, repair, and reconstruction. Such a program conceivably could
have implications for land acquisition or encroachment of forested lands. A complementary,
World Bank-assisted investment project ("Road Sector Program Support Project"), however, i s
helping ensure that there are no significant environmental effects from this road rehabilitation
program. In fact, the investment project's environmental assessment concludes that the project
involves the rehabilitation o f existing road networks, and will not require any new road
construction or widening. The common, localized effects o f road reconstruction (e.g., dust and
noise, disposal of materials) can also be managed by existing capacity. The investment project
also confirms that materials used in the rehabilitation program will meet international standards
for environmental safety.




                                                 33

                                           F.      RISKS

113.    The risks for this PRSC2 include (i)   fiduciary risks; (ii)implementation capacity at the
central and decentralized level; (iii)
                                     external shocks; and (iv) political economy risks.

114.    Fiduciary risks. The Government's continued efforts to strengthen public financial
management and procurement systems are reducing fiduciary risks with regard to the use o f
public funds. The PRSC program, as well as the Bank's and donor's work in these areas, i s
providing assistance to the Government inthis endeavor.

115.    Implementation capacity. The Government has limited institutional capacity which could
delay the implementation o f its ambitious reform agenda. Most line ministries still have limited
capacity for the systematic selection and appraisal o f projects, implementation, and evaluation
and this may lead to the sub-optimal allocation o f budgetary resources. To mitigate these risks,
all the reform areas benefit from Bank and donor-supported TA and capacity buildingprograms
or investment operations. In areas where donor engagement i s limited, implementation risk will
likely remainhigh.

116.    Destabilizing external shocks. Greater integration into the global economy, both respect
to trade and labor flows (Le. remittances), makes Moldova more vulnerable to external market
developments. The price o f natural gas imported inMoldovawill rise to European levels over the
next five years. Higher electricity prices from Ukraine are also forthcoming. Higher energy
prices may have significant poverty implications with the burden o f the price increase falling
disproportionately on the poor and on households with limited alternative sources o f fuel. Rising
food prices, stemming from either domestic or international sources, if they outstrip income
growth, could have a disproportional impact on poor households. Underthis PRSC2, the Bank i s
promoting reforms to improve the efficiency o f the energy and agricultural sectors as well as the
Government's social assistance system. As demonstrated at the Consultative Group meeting,
Moldova will be the recipient o f considerable donor financing in the coming years. The Bank,
the IMF and other donors, have shown flexibility in the amount o f available financing to
respond, ifneeded, to external shocks.

117.    Political economy. Under the EGPRSP and the NDS, Moldova has articulated an
ambitious reform program. Over the last few years, the Government has established a steady
track record of reform, albeit with some efforts proceeding faster than others. The extensive
consultations surround the development o f the NDS indicate that a high degree o f political
consensus has been established behind this reform program. Along with the reaffirmation o f
Moldova's EU aspiration, this give comfort that the agenda laid out inthe NDS will be pursued.
However, a number o f reforms - civil service, education and agricultural reform - will be
politically challenging particularly as next year's elections draw closer. These looming elections
may rupture the political consensus that has developed behind the Government's reform
program. The close linkage between the PRSC-supported reform agenda and substantial donor
assistance (DFID, SIDA, the Netherlands and EU) planned for Moldova continues to be a
mitigating factor.

          Poverty Reduction and EconomicGrowth Reform Program In Moldova


        Dear Mr.Zoellick:

               The actions undertaken by the Moldovan authorities in line with the Letter of
        DevelopmcntPolicy of 2006 haw contributedto the improvemcnt of the economic situation:
       foreign and structural vulnerabilities were reduced considerably as a result of monetaryand
       austere fiscal policies and implementationo f structural refornis. The present letter reviews
       the polities highlighted in the previous letter. updated in light of semi-annunl evaluation of
       Moldova's performnnccs in the frarncwork of` thc povcrty reduction program suppoited
       through a tri-annual PRSC Credit.

               The Government's key priorities for 2007 werc highlighted in the Economic Growth
       and Poverty Reduction Straregy Paper CEGPRSP) and the ELI-Moldova Action Plan, the
       implementation timeframes of which arc expiring at the end of 2007 and early 2008
       respectively. The implementation o f objectives contained in these two strategic documents
       hasonly kenpartially accomplished, due to external factors such as the 2006 shocks (double
       increase of natural gas prices and wine ban imposed by the Russian Federation), as well as
       internal factors such as tlie 2007 drought, the limited capacity of public adininisisationto
       fulfill policy obligatiolis and its dependence on Legislativc prerogatives in approving the
       proposed reforms, in addition to the limited resoiirces fivailahle for carrying out expensive
       reforms. In order to extend thc resource framework and thus speed up the pace of
       successfully accomplishing the propoacct ob.jectives. thc Government had succcssfhlly
       secured financial assistance in the amount of 1.2 bln. LIS dollars in the frarncwork of the
       ConsultativeGroup, which took place in Brussels, in Deccmbct 2006.




                                                       35

         In order to ensure policy conrinuity aftcr the expiration o f EGPRSP and the EU-
Moldova Action plan, but equally to create an irnprovcd framework for prioritizing public
policies, the Government has launcheda process for the devetopmentof a new medium-term
strategic planning document inearly 2007    -the  National DevelopmentStrategy (NDS) 2008-
2011.     NDP moves away From sectorial approach to a model of limited intersectorial
priorities  - ,,horizontal" approach. As such, the draft NDS strategy contains five key
priorities:

         Consolidating democratic system based on the rule of law and respect for human
                        Q
         rights;
         Transnistrianconffict settlcment md tlic reunification of the country;
         lncreasingthe cornpetitivenessof`the nationaleconomy;
         Developing human resources, increasingemploymentand promoting social inclusion;
         and
         Regionaldevelopment.

         One of the main goals of NDS is the aggregation of Moldova`s key foreign
commitments into a comprchcnsive strategy (without substitutingbilateral policy documents)
and the creation of. a unified system to monitor the successful implementation of these
commitments.

         Another important activity pertaining to strategic planning, which was completed in
2007, was the developrneiit of a sectorial and economic growth constraints analyses. These
documentswere developedinorder to identify tbc intervention areas targeted for the compact
program of the Millennium Challenge Corpomtion. Similarly to the NDS draft, the draft
sectorial and economic growth constraints reports were supported by a broad participatory
process. The reports identified a range of issues related to investment climate and lack of
adequate infrastructure: which represent the current key constraints hindering economic
growth.

         Overall, the key Ciovernmcntpriorities for 2008 remain unchanged: poverty reduction
through cnsuring macroeconomic stability and sustainable economic growth. We hope to
fulfill these objectives through a inodernization of the public service and preventing state
interference in economy, in addition to developing a sound financial system, creating a
favorable investment climate, small and medium business development, infrastructure
rehabilitation,export promotion, job creation iu Moldova mid provision of social protection
to socially vulnerable groups. These objectives, which include the accomplishment of the
Millennium DevelopmentGoals, are reflectedin the NDS and other policy docunients.


A. Context

    I. Povewprofile undevolutintt
        Starting in 2006 the National Bureau 01' Statistics has made substantial changes to the
Household Budget Survey (IIBS) , which incasures poverty. These modifications involve
changes to the benchmark framework. improving the data collection tools aid creation of a
unifiednetworkofdatacollection far social researchpurposes.




                                                                                             2



                                               36

       It is worth mentioning that changes applied to HBS in 2006 have improved data
quality md contributed to the harmonization of applied poverty nieasurenient methodology
to international standards. At the same time, these changes are contributing to the fact that
indicators for measuring poverty levels in 2006 are not comparable with those in previous
years. As such, data for 2006 is a referencepoint for analyzingpoverty levels in the following
yetirs.

       According to statisticaldata for 2006, 30.2%ofthe population was below poverty level,
with 4.5% below extreme poverty levels, Ihe incidence of extreme poverty is low. a factor
which demonstrates that food-driven poverty will soon be OSlittle reIevance for the Republic
of Moldova, Therefore, we are highlighting the need to introduce evaluation indicators,
which meet higher statidards and towards which Moldova should strive, such as a more
generouslevel o fpoverty analysis, the quality and cultureo f nutrition.

       In 2006, similar trends of poverty profile GS in previous yeats can be noticed. In
Moldova, the large households, with many children, employed in the agricultural sector and
older people are most heavy influenced by poverty. Also, there are huge differencesbetween
rural and urban areas, those living in rtrral areas beingexposed to a higher dcgree of poverty.
Povertyamong children is also an unfortunate reality.

    II.     Economic growth

         During2000-2007, real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 5.7%. with cumulative
growth totaling 55.1% compared to 1999. At the same time, in 2007, Gross Domestic Product
(GDP)reachedB nominal value of 53.4 bln. Lei and a real growth rateof 3% compared to the
similar periodof last year.
          Inflation was maintainedat a reasonablelevel, falling down from 18.4% in 2000to 1
13.10/0in2007.which is one percentagepoint less than the Icvelregisteredin2006.
          Thc national currency rate of exchange was gradually appreciating, with National
Bank reserves increasingsignificantly to reach 1.3 billionUSdollars.
         Real GDP growth in 2008 is expected to stand at 6%, ils a result of industria1and
agricultural output increasc, as well as R result of significant growth of investments in the
national economy. Also, efforts will be undertaken in order to maintain ihc rhythm of
inflation growthbelow 10%.

        Growth raies und economic development indicators will be contingent largely upon the
investmentand entrepreneurship activities, botha1the nationaland local levels. In the medium
tcnn, the Government will undertake measures to substantially improve the investment and
business climate through promoting stable, transparent and eficient regulatory policies,
throughcompetitivenessenhancementandsmallandmediumenterprisedevelopment. This will
mobilize the economy's investmentpotential, made up of remittances coming from Moldovan
workers from overseas, the banking sector resources and the underground economy,
concessionalinternationalassistutlceanddirect foreigninvestment.

    IH.     Esfablishnienfofflsd space

        A moderate increase of public expenditures is plannedFor the forthcoming years as a
consequence of the relatively high level o f public sector consumptionas share of the gross
domestic product. The estiniarions of the medium tenn resource framework reveal that
medium term financing opportunities of new expenditures is limited.`rhcrefore, the medium

 term budgetary policy highlights the need to focus on efficiency and effectivenessof existing
public expenditure programs and underscom the importance of redirecting existing
 allocations from less priority programsto high-impact economic-orientedprogramsaimed at
 reducingpoverty.

         The need to improve the manner o f using existing resources, thus making available
 resources for new policy initiatives becomes ever more stringent in the context of
concentrating existing resources in support of key priorities highlighted in the 2008-2011
NationalDevelopment Strategy.

    V.       A viable macroeconomicframework
         Fiscalpolicies

         The fiscal policy for 2008 will remainaustere given the high rate of inflation and the
need to ensure macroeconomic stability and consolidate the overall mode's trust in the
program. In this context, the Govemm&t will maintain a budgetary defic'it at 0.5% of the
GDP.
         In order to prornotc foreign and domestic investments, we have announced a major
avcrhaul of the tax sjstrm for lcgal entities, as well as ~1 fiscal amnesty for all outstanding
debt and a IihcTalization01'   regulations pertaining to capital legalization. The corporate tax
rate L   V set
            ~  to zero, with the exception of dividend payments or such instances when other
expenses, except business ones, are registered The reform also foresees a write-off of all
fiscal debt accumulated prior to 2007 (including fines and associated penalties not paid prior
to &e law's cntry into forcc). We understand tllat such reforms imply certain risks, especially
with regard to budget revenues, therefore, we have adopted a series of conipensation
measures in order to respect the fiscal and macroeconomic indicators included in the
program.
         Given that fiscal amnesty is aonetime thing, which will not be repeated, we intendto
accelerate tlie implementation of the fiscal administration consolidation strategy* Hence,
following the implementation of the plan approved in September 2007, we will improve the
system of fiscal debt management in order to ensure debt repayment after its accumulation.
We will be introducing a set of prompt and unconditional measures to forcefufly collectdebt,
we will be amending the current legislation in order to shorten and simplify the procedures
lor annulment of fiscal debt which can't be collected and we will consolidate all domestic
fiscal activities for evaluating and collecting debt under the umbrella of one consolidated
agency.

        Budgetary policy has in fact been lbcusedon rationalizing and muking more efficient
public expenditures, as wcll as redlocaiing existing resources from less important to priority
programs, which have o substantial iniyact OR economic growth and poverty reduction.
Medium term forecasts will continue to serve the key tool of matching Government policy
priorities with avaitable resources. Through MTEF, proposed sectorial policies will be
evaluated by means o f their financial implications, also taking into account potential reserves
available inthe processof resourcemanagement.
        Treasury system development was continued as a means to consolidate financial
discipline, including improvement of budget executionprocedures.
        As a result of undertakenmeasures, the revenuesof the national public budget in2007
haveincreasedby 25% comparedto the previousyear.
        The expendituresof the national public budget have increased by 24.7% compared to
2006. The plicies related to public expenditures remainedsocialiy-oriented, as such 62.6%


                                                                                              4

of the national public budget was directed towards the social sphere and 16.7% of the total
public budget was directedtowardseconomic-relatedexpenditures.

        Morretaryand exchangeratepoliries

        In 2008 the National Bank of Moldova will continue to promote an austere and
prudent monetary and currency policy in order to achieve the planned 10% annual inflation
rate. 'The programforesees a monetarybase increase of 25% by the end of2OO8. with interest
rates on a positive trend in real terms. This goal will be reached through the application of
indirect instruments of monetary policy and will be facilitated by the improved situation o f
the National Bank of Mddova, as well as the transfer of remaining deposits from the
National Social Insurance House and the National Medical House into the National Bank of
Moldova's consolidated account by end of 2007. Also, by the end of 2007, the remaining
resources of territorial adminimtive units will be transferred into the National Bank of
Moldova's account.

 1.     The fundamental objective of the monetary and currency policy is ensuring and
maintainingprice stability. Thus, the National Bank of Moldova will continue to maintain a
floating regimeof national currency cxchangerate and will interveneon the currencymarket
in order to prevent excessive national currency fluctuations, which according to our
expectations will allow an increase of internationalreserves to a level equivalent with three
months of forecasted imports.


B. Main Program Pillars
            I. Generalprovisions

      Taking into account the motivation to adopt profound and radical reforms, the
Government has assumed the leadingrole in the implementationofa Program, with financial
support from the poverty reduction support credit, which contains the following three major
pillars:
      (a) improving the investmentclimate;
      (b) increasingthe efficiency and managementof public sector resources; and
      (c) strengtheningsocial protectionsystems.
      From among the twenty establishedobjectivesand policy benchmarksundertakenunder
PRSC I,the Government has managedto achieve different results. In such sectors as health,
energy and social assistance, the reform program has overcome the expectations includedin

      ambitious reform promotedby central public authorities, aimed at contributing to liberalizing
      the economy throughpromoting three different activities;
             --- capital legalization
                 fiscal amnesty
                 reformof the corpomt&tax system
             Also, it shall be noted that in 2007 a number of activities were continuedwith regard
      IO the implementation of legislative provisioiis on the principles and basic mechanisms for
      regulatingentrepreneurialactivities,
                 In the context of regulatory framework efficiency the Government will continue
      the implementatioiiof the lbllowingactivities in 2008:
             -  Finalizing the full analysis of laws which regulate business activity on the basis of
      the Lawon the principles and mechanismsofrcgulatingentrepreneurialactivity.
             - Adopting the Law on credit history bureaus

             -  Implementing the provisions of the Law regarding industrial parks 164-XV of
      13.07.2007
             - Implementation o   f the 2008 provisions of the Strategy on investment attraction and
     export promotion, partkutarly: the signature ofthe asynunetric trade agreement with the EU,
     developingcountry brniidiiigand promotingdomesticproduct brands, organizing and hosting
     investment forums. including dissemination o f analytical and informational materials about
     the investment climate in Moldova.

                    i.Regulaloryframework reform

             The Law on tlic basic principles of state regulation of entrepreneurial activity -
     adopted last year - contained a series of provisions, which came into force on the date of
     publication. The other ones transitory provisiuns- were scheduled to enter into force within
                                  -
      12 months following thc adoptionofthe Law.
             Out of the transitory provisions, those which relateto the introduction of Regulatory
     lmpact Assessment have already been implemented: RIA methodology was developed and
     approvedby the Government, Ministrieu'Agencies have established RIA units and currently
     work isbeingcarried out to buildthe capacity of these institutions.
             A general revision of legislation has been undertaken, which resulted in a number of
    recommendationsto amend over 80 laws. The legislative package to be amended included
    plannedamendments inthe area of licensing, due to the fact that cutting redtape inobtaining
     licenses constitutes a key element of regulatory reformand aims to improve a major area of
    concernfor Moldova's private sector, one which has been on the agenda for many years.
             Over the course of 2008, the ongoing reform of the business regulatory framework
    will be implemented and aimed to simplify and optimize registration, operation and
    liquidation af businesses, thus reducing, by far, the human / adniinistrative factors in these
    processes. We tiill continue thr. implemcntation of procdures for Regulatory impact
    Analjsis and esamination of normative acts in the franiework of the Working Group of the
    State Commissionfor Regulationof EntrepreneurialActivity. Starting with 2008, informative
    notes, which accompany newly developed offictal acts, will contain a regulatory impact
    assessment

             At the m e time, the Government will undertake activities to improve the
    institutional structure and functions of state control bodies, directing their work mainly
    towards oversight of enterpriseactivity without the need for on-site visits, with verifications

takingplaceonly in such cases when there are clear indicationsthat enterprises are violiting
legislativeprovisions.
        The need to harmonize the nationalIcgisfationrelated to protectionof competitionto
EU standards is imperative. It is essential to better define the various aspects of unfair
competitionby market partners and clearly spell out the prerogativesof the NationalAgency
for ProtectionofCompetitioninenforcinganenvironment of fair competition.

               ii.Trndefacilitation

        Over the course of the first year o PRSC implementation the Government of
Moldovahas managedto complete, with supwrrt from a World Bank credit, a projectrelated
to facilitationof tradeand transport in south-eastEurope.
        Ail foreigneconomic transactions are examined under ASYCUDA WORLD inorder
to evaluate risk factors and the possible impact on the economy. This includes a reductionof
the numberof document checksandphysicalinspections, a factor which could l e d to export
competitivenessenhancement, attractionofforeign investmentsand a better integrationinthe
globaleconomy.
        The Customs Service has taken over the responsibilityof collecting, processing and
monitoringperformanceindicatorsrelatedto customswork and goods processing.

        The Customs Department has initiatedand coordinates the implementationprocessof
the "one-stop-shop" concept at the border crossings, which represents a component of an
integrated state border management system. This factor highlights the ongoing reform of
services and agencies responsible for state border controls, their efficient collaboration, the
simplification of procedures and a reduction of the amount of time necessary for customs
procedures, through an application of the "one-stop-shop" principfe. in accordance with the
recommendationsof international organizations. At the same time, a series of changes and
legislative amendments, which aim to harmonize Moldovan laws with European Union
standards have been initiated.At 4 customsoffices in Moldovaan element ofthe "one-stop-
shop" concept has been put into practice, which pertains to transmission of all customs
procedures to one inspector. The first results of this change are highlighting an increased
efficiency through a substantial reductionof the time necessary for completion of customs
procedures.
        Inaccordancewith rur action planapproved by the Govemmcnt, the Customs Service
has started the implementationof WCO Framework Staridads regarding the Security and
Facilitationof World Trade. The accomplishment of the above actions, the strengtheningof
the capacities and integrity of customs bodies, the sjmplificutionof customs procedures and
harmonization of the legislative framework with EU legislationwill remain, for thc future,
key priority areasfor the CustomsService,


C.Developmeatofagricultural markets

        Despite the imporlance of the agricultural sector for the country's economy, it
continuesto display modestperformances incomparison with the rest of the economy. Whilst
cumulativeeconomic growth for 2000-2006 totaled approximately40%, the growth rate in
agriculture din not exceed 10% for the same period of time, Year 2007 was particularly
dificult for the Moldovan agriculture due to severe drought in the summer months, which
consequentlyhadadevastatingimpactoncrops andlivestock.

 a new sector strategy        -  The National Strategy for sustainable development of thc agro-
 industrial sector for 2008-2015, as well as the Action Plan regardingits implementation'. The
 document was approved by the Government in December2007.

       --  Increasingthe quality of life ofpeople in ruraiareas
           Ensuringthe country's foud security
           Soil quality conservation


 The Government is reiterating its commitment to promoting a sustainable developmentof the
 agricultural sector through enhancing the competitiveness and productivity of the sector,
 development of agricultural markets, eliminating Inarkel distortions including export
 restrictions as well as attraction of private investments in thc private sector. The export of all
 agricultural products through the Universal Commodities Market is completely voluntary.
 The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry is monitoring the impact of eliminating the
 above restriction through a continuous analysis of prices for grains and oil seeds on domestic
 and international markets, particularly in neighboring countries such as Romania, Ukraine,
 Russia. The recently compteted study on food security and grain price stabilization will serve
 as analytical base for taking informed decisions in shaping future state policies o f supporting
 the grain sector inthe contextoffood security and poverty reduction.
          The Action Plan regarding the implementation of the Strategy for the development o f
 the ago-food sector incorporates, among others, those actions planned under the matrix
 policy for PRSC 11.
          As such. the Government has carried out over the c o w of 2007 the following
 actions, which arc rclevant to policy matrix commitments in terms of the plant variety
 registration system: (i)the testing period was reduced to 2 years for seeds and 5 years for
 planting material; (ii)the membership of the National Council was reviewed and interested
 parzies excluded; (iii)thc right to appeal the refusal to register a variety was introduced. The
number ofnew varieties registered in2007 will approximate 80-90, which will represent a 5-
 6% increase compared to 2006. In 2008 the Government plans to broaden the spectrum of
activities inthis area.
          With regard to the certification and standardization of products, the activities carried
out in 2007 included, but were not limited to': (i) increasing the degree of convergence of
d o n a 1 legislation pertaining to f d products witb EL! principles on food safety and the
general requirements on food product marking; (ii)reorganization of veterinary labs in a
consolidated network of regional labs and initiating their renovation and re-equipping with
modern equipment; (iii)establishment and equipping o f a unique and modern centre for
alcohol product testing; (iw) creation of an animal register and initiation of implementation of
animal identificationand traceability systems.
          Development of an agricultural markets infi,rrnution system requires a broadapproach
and a linking to existing informational systems in the I'I" network, in line with the National
Strategy on Building an Infoimationd Society. As an intermediary measure for better
inforniing the domestic agriculturrtt producers, the Government is collaborating with two

 With the entry into force of the new strategy for 2008-2020,the previousstrategy for 2006-2015 (including the
Action Plan) will be abrogated.

 basic agriculturd products.
         'TheAction Plan regardingthe implementationof the new strategy and actions thereof
 include: (i)creation of an efficient and sustainable market information system; (ii)
 improvement of the certificationandstandardizationsystem for agriculturalproducts and (hi)

 One of the biggest concernsof Government and the public over the past two years has been
 the potential impacts of risingprices for food staples-particularly grains. Duringthis time,
 Government has periodically used the Strategic Grain Reserve to keep the price of bread
 constant by providing wheat and wheat flower to bakeries. Government recognizes that to
 minimila market distonions, it is important for the Strategic Grain Reserve to operate in a
 transparentand objectivemanner, while at the same time using it to avoidfoodemergencies.
 Ta this end, the Government completed Government hiredexperts within PHRD for PRSC,
 which recently completed a Food S'ecuri@ and Grain Price Stcrbilitatiun Study. In 2008,
 Govtrtiinent will begin implemcntation of aa Action Plan based on the recommendationsof
 the study. including to (i)approve regulations defining how and when the Strategic Grain
 Reserveshould intervene (it., define"food emergency")..

The Government is convinced that all measures undertaken in the framework of PRSC
aiming to develop agricultural markets are substantially contributing to enhancing the
competitiveness and efficiency of the agricultural sector and equally to poverty reduction,
and would like to express its commitment to further continueand enhance efforts inthis area
inorder to reachsustainable growth inthe agricultural sector, which is of vital importancefor
the country's economy and a largepart of the population.

D.Reducingenergy vulnerability

        Minimizing Moldova's energy vtilnerability to external shock prices remains a major
challenge for the Government.'The increasein energy prices, especially natural gas, hasonce
again hightighted the importanceof incretasingcncrgy efficiency rinddiversifyingthe types of
energy sources and suppliers. Without progress indiversifyingenergy sourcesand suppliers,
the increase in energy prices could have a negative impact on the competitiveness, already
quitepoor, of local products,its well as the generat livingconditions inthe country.
        Recently, (August 2007) a new energy strategy was adopted ttvouyh 2020, which
foresees a series of goals and measures to move towards a more efficient, competitive atid
safe energy sector, modernization of the existing energy infrastructure, increasing energy
efficiency, making use of renewable energy resources and integration into the European
energy market.
        Over the course of 2007 a series of measures were undertaken to adjust tariffs to
energy resources in order tu cover the increase in energy resource prices. The rates of cash
collection are maintained at over 90% for natural gas, whilst power plants are paying in a
proportion of83% for naturalgasand 95% for electricity.
        For the forthcoming perid of poverty reduction program implementation the
Ciovernment will review thc existing iegal and regulatory framework in order to adopt and
irnplernent an Action Pian for ensuring the legal correlation uf the domestic natural gas and
energy markets with the nornisestablished by the South-EastEurope Energy Community.As
such, the focus will be placcdon the development and initiation of'new legislationand new
market rules.


                                                                                            9

         Inorder to promote slatepolicy inthe area of energyefficiency and renewablesourccs
 of energy. the creation of an Agency for Energy EiXciency is planned. At the same time, in
 order to implement programs and measures ro increase thc energy efficiency and promote
 new technologies with higher productivity and lower consumption levels the legislative-
 nurmative basis will be put in place in order to stimulate these activities and work will be
 carried out to fimher raiseawarenessof this issueamong companies inthe sector.
         The success of these measures will facilitate the attraction of investments in energy
 efficiency projects in the public and private sectors, contributing to the reduction o f the
 energy intensity of the economy. Tariff policies will serve as a cornerstone for the energy
 sources eficiency program. which the Government will develop and implement in order to
 improve the financial viability o f enterprises in the energy sector, including 'i'ermocom
 company.


 11.     Increasing the Efficiency and Management of Public Sector
 Resources
         The general objectives of the Ascal policy for 2008-2010 will be: (i)ensuring fiscal
 equality, stability and transparency; (ii)optimizing fiscal pressure and extending the fiscal
 basis; (iii)systeniarimtion atid simplification ctf fiscal legislation; (iv) harmonization o f
principles underlyingthe national fiscal legislation with EUlegislation.
        The analysis o f public expenditures reveals the balanced relationship between real
expenditures and budgetary planning, In gcneral, the control wid monitoring o f budget
execution are good and have clearly establishedprocedures. In ordcr to create and implement
an eficient and modern internal public control and audit, and inorder to ensure compatibility
with EUrcquirernents, a strategy for the development of internal public financial control has
been developed. At the same time, work is being carried out in order to approve a reform
concept o f record-keeping inthe public system,

        The Govemient agenda in 2008 will include a set o f structural measures aimed at
strengtheningthe economy's resistanceto external shocks and create a solid base for a robust
and inclusive economic growth. In this context, the reform o f central public administration
and the business repuialory framework will be ongoing. At the same time, a set of measures
will be undemken to improve the performance of the agricultural sector. through the
revitalization of irrigation systems. In order to enhance the competitiveness of domestic
products  OR the  internal and external markets a special attention will be given to improving
the quality infrastructure.
        lncreasiny the population's access, cspecially the vulnerable groups, to basic medical
semiccs through developing the primary medical sector, ensuringaccess to quality education,
consolidating the financial stability of the social insurance system, as well as the
improvement of the social services system by makingthem pro-poor oriented are some of the
essential chaltenges faced by the Govemnwnt in the medium tcrm framework. The policies
proposed in the framework of poverty reduction support credit are aimed at improving the
efticiency andnianagcinent of publicresources.


A.      Meritocratic public service

        The objective of. the reform started in the second half of 2005 is the creation of a
modem and efficient sytem of central public administration in line with the European Union
principles of g o d gwemance. The reforni implies the modernization of public administration



                                                                                           10

 in the Republic o f Moldova through the reorganization of central public administration,
 optimization of the decisionmaking process and improving the management of human
 resourcesin the public service.
         The implementation of the central public administration reform for 2007 was oriented
 towards the reorganization of the central executive branch, elaboration o f development plans,
 increasingthe ef'ficiency of'the policy docuiiicnt analysisand coordination system.
         In September 2007, the Directorate for analysis of policy coordination was set up
 within the Government Apparatus, which aims to support the Cabinet o fMinisters indefining
 the policy prioritiesand intersectorial coordination inthe mediumterm.
         The draft of the Law on public service and the status o fthe civil servant was approved
 by the Governmentand submitted to the Parliament for review.
         Over the course of this year the adoption of secondary leyislatioii is plmed, which is
 necessary for the implementation of the new law, the completion of the classification and
 grading system in accordance with reviewed job descriptions, as well as the adoption of
 legislation regarding the new system of remuneration for civil servants, which should be
 accessible, transparentand uniform.

 E,      Remunerstion

         Here, it should be noted that work has been undertaken in order to develop the
 concept of financial motivation and detrrininatiunof individual salaries for certain categories
 of civil servants. Work has been carried out also injob performance evaluation methodology
 for civil servants.

         The process of improving the motivation system of civil servants will be continued
over the course of this year. In 2008, particularly, a new system o f rcmuneratioii for civil
 servants will be developed, which wilI consolidatesalary bonuscsand premiums into the base
salary, in accordance with the new system of classification and grading o f civil service
functions. The variable part of the monthly salary will includc the payment awards for
qualifications andawards for individual and group performanceofcivil servants.

C.       Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF)

         The development of MTEF inthe Republic of Moldova. as an instrument for medium
tenn strategic planning, over the course of the past five years was the cornerstone, which
guided the reforms of the methods and procedures that regulate budgetary planning.
Amendments werc made to budgetary legislation in order to ensure that MTEF is an
indispensable part ot' the budgetary cycle. MTEF serves as the strategic franiework for the
national budget and facilitates the process of preparation and examination of the annual
budget. The implemenlation of MTEF has increased the transparency and the understanding
o f the budgetary process within the Government and civil society.

        Over the coursc of 2007 the Government has launched a process of identifying major
investment projects. The lack o f necessary information has made it difficult to finalize this
excrcise. Draft strategies have been recently developed in two pilot sectors and identified
over the courseofproject scanning    -water  and sewageand roads.

        Starting in 2008, the National DcveIoprnent Strategy (NDS) will represent the main
document which sets the objectives and priorities of Government plicy in the medium t e n
(2008-2011). I t will require a concentration and targeting of existing resources. In order to
ensurea strong correlation betweenthe MDS and MTEF, the annual updateof the NDSaction


                                                                                             1 1


                                               45

 plan will be alignad with the MTEF drafting schedule and the annual budget. Also, these
 processes will be correlated in terns of the decision making mechanism with regard to
 priority resourceallocation.

          in order to improve the method of amelating the strategic policy formulation,
 especially the National Development Strategy (2008-2011) and the Action Plan for the
 implementation of the Strategy with the budgetary process, the Prime-Minister issued an
 instruction (February 2008) rcgnrdirig the Concept of policy priorities in the context ofMTEF
 development 2009-2011
                                I The provisions setforth in this Concept wifl serve as the basis for
 the developmento fthe MTEF 2009-201 1draft andthe draft on fiscal policy for 2009.


D.       Agricultural spending

         The Government is reiteratingits comnitment to continue its efforts to optimize and
enhance h e agricultural support system, aiming to increase the competitiveness and growth
 in the sector, as well as reduce poverty in rural areas. Inthis context, the Government has
eliminated, in 2007, existing restrictions to access subsidies conditional upon the size of
agricultural enterprises. Currently, only suhsidies for vineyard plantations main
conditional3and the Government will inake efforts to eliminate these remaining restrictions.
         Eliminationofrestriction criteria to access subsidies based on farm size has ledto the
incrcase of share of subsidies received by individual farnis (comprised of peasant farms and
rurat households) up to 17% in 2007. Currently individual sector is using 40% of agricultural
land, produce 70% of agricultural production and represent 99% froin the total number of
agricuttural farms. Therefore the Govemtnent recognizesthe necessityto do more inorder to
increase the access of this sector to programs of pubfic support. Thc eflbrts will be made to
increase the share of subsidiesobtained by individual sector starting from 2008.
         Inorder make more efficient use of limitedbudgetaryresources the Government has
developed a new Concept on subsidizing agricultural producers for 2008-20IS, which spells
out the objectives, principles, key directions, eligibility criteria as well as the institutional
fbnctionality of this new system of agricul~uralsupport. These principles will represent the
basis oflegislative uinendinentswhich relateto state suppon for the agricultural sector.
         The severe drought o f 2007 has caused cnnsidcrable Iosscs in the agricultural sector
leading to a 23,1% decrease in agricultural production compared to 2006. In order to
minimize the negative consequences of drought the Government has undertaken a series of
measures, including an increase of the subsidies amount (mainly current subsidies) by 200
million lei. This factor prevented the ltccomptishment of PRSC commitments pertaining to
the reallocation of agricultural expenses towards servicesand investment subsidks.
         In this context, the Government &insto cover these gaps in2008 in the framework of
the Regulation regarding the maimer of resource utilimtion from the subsidy fund for
agricultural producers for 2008. Inaccordance with the existing legislation. in 2008, provided
the budget for 2008 remains unchanged, the share of services as part of the t ~ t aagricultural  l
budget will reach 37%. which will represent an increase of 11% compared to 2006 figures
{14% compared to 2007 figures). Investment subsidies will constitute 73% as share of total
subsidies. 27% is respectively the share of current subsidies. As such, the share o f investment
subsidies will increase by 21K cornpared to the levels registered in 2006 (42% comparedto
2007 figures). The Government has reconfirnted its commitment to direct the agricultural
allocations towards activities which generate sustainable growth, such                 BS services (which

 represent public goods) and investment subsidies (aimed to encouraging private sector
 investments). It is obvious that in order to reach these objectives it will be necessary to
 strictly follow the budgetary allocations.
          The Government recognizes the need to reform the system of researchand education
 inagriculture, which unfortunately loses touch with the real sector of the economy. Inthis
 respect, the ,,Evaluation of the researchand education system in agriculture" was developed,
 which focused on the identification of problems in this area and formulation o f practical
 solutions  IO overcome the above issue. On the basis of this study's recomtnendations, the
 Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry, in collaboration with the Academy of Sciences of
 Moldova wid agriculturd research institutions, are currently developing an Action Plan
 regarding the refonn of thc research-innovation sphere and improvement of the financing of
 scientific research in the agricultural sector. Also, over the: course: of next years the
 Governmentwill develop a concept of modernization of scientific researchand education in
 the agricultural sector.
          Also, in 2007 an evaluation o f the efficiency ofthe special service oractive influence
 on hydro-meteorological processes was carried out. We would like to mention that the
 Government is open to a long-term collaboration with the Wortd Bank in the framework of
 the Regional Program on Reducing the Risk of Natural Calamities for south-east European
 countries, which was recently launched.

 E,       Transportinfrastructure

          Inaccordancewith the Government's goals, the reformofroadtransportation includes
the implementation of a comniitment program aimed to stop the degradation ofthe road fund
and commence their gradual renovation, create a sustainable system for sector financing,
 modernize the technical evaluation of roads and negotiate with international financial
 institutions in order to obtain loans for projects targeted for rehabilitation of national roads of
 Europeanimportance.

         In order to accomplish these reforms. the Govenment has engaged ina series of mad
network rehabilitation projects with support from foreign creditors (World Bank, European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, European Investment Bank). The LandTransport
Infrilstructure Strategy was developed and approved. It covers all essential aspects of
management and financing of roads and railways and in particular: (i)road maintenance
financing reform; (ii)gradual introduction of competition in road niaintenance contracts
commissioning and (iii)participation o f road users in the oversight of road niaintenance
financing. The Strategy dso contains a prioritized investment flan for roads and railways
infrastTucture .
         As a measure of accomplishment of the approved Strategy, an overhaul of the legal
framework related to road maintenancefinancing will be carried out.
         The creation of a sustainEtble and transparent system of road financing is a priority on
the agenda of local and central public administration. Inthis confext, the Government plansto
invest more in this sector. also by means of increasing annual budgetary allocations, equally
focusing on maintenance and repairs of roads inorder to reduce the volume of national roads
in a precariousstate. In2007, the total volume of financing from various sources reached50
mln. USD. For the next year we forecast a gradual increase o f the allocation for road
maintenance. At the same time, the Government will respond to issues of inefficient
expcnditure in the sector through a gradual improvement of the capaciry o f State Roads
Administration body, in addition to improving the quality of competition in contract
commissioning for road maintenanceand rehabifitation,

  F.     Educationalsystem
         Recognizing the decisive role o f education, and taking into account the constitutional
provisions and other commitments, the Government has incliided in the National
DevelopmentStrategy the objective drafied inEGPRSP: ensuring access to quality education
services and an efficient and sustainable hnctioning o f the educational system, increasing its
role in economic and human resource development. At the smie time, one of the main
objectives of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) for Moldova is provision of
universal access to basic education.
        The project ,,Quality education inniral mas'' has already started with support fram the
World R`ank. The Ministry o f Education, Youth and Sports has developed the Strategy for
oplimimion of secondary education school networks inthe Republlic of Moldova on the basisof
an analj.ticalreport, which containsinformation abut the current situation and trends with re@
to institutionalnetworks,capacity, numbers ofstudents, professors. administrativestaffetc.

        The draft strategy is elaborated based on school mapping exercise, proposals of local
public administrationsand its goal is to make more eEcient use of financial resources, capacity
o f education institutions of capital investments and hnctional structures o f education system
and not in the last instance to ensue access to quality education for all children from our
Kepublic

        This year, the piloting of strategy is planned to be launched in two pilot rayons among
schoolsidentifiedfor optimization.
        At the same time, we will be reviewing the current financing formula for secondary
education institutions  - piloted in the fkamework of the ,,Quality education in rural arcas"
projcct. The new financing formula, combined with school autonomy and network
optimization, *ill contribute to the improvement of quality through st better efficiency, thus
freeing resources for teaching staff salary increases and other items pertaining to quality in
education,such as teaching materials, equipment and refreshertrainings.

G. Health sector reform

       In the past few years Moldova has achieved a significant progress in health sector
reform.
       Firststage ofreforms was oriented towards stopping the decline ofthe healthsystem,
causedby the financial crises of the 1990s.
      Second stage, was largely charicterizcd by the introduction of mandatory medical
assistanceinsurance, which made medical care more affordable financially, yet the financial
protection offered by health insurance made the sanitary system become more receptive to
population's needs. The level of people's satisfaction with the quality of heafth services has
also increased prior to the introduction of this substantial reform. Currently, 77.8% of the
population is covered under the mandatory medical insurance schcnie, with 56% of the
resourcesin the medical assistance insurance fund corning from budgetary sources allocated
for catcgories of beneficiaries covered by the state. The mandatory medical assistance has
nut managedto include amongits beneficiaries self-employed peopleof working age.
      Next stage o f reforms foresees the mobilization of all resources towards structural
changes, which wouid result in an improved efficiency and qunlity of the health systemand a
broudcrcoverageo f the populationby mandatory medical assistance.
     The Government is in the process of developing the new elements of health insurance,
in order to extend the coverage of population, especially in rural arms, with mandatory


                                                                                             14



                                               48

 medical assistance insurance policies. Additionally, in order to increase the medical
 insurance coverage, the Government aims to introduce a benefits scheme, which involves
 the reduction of the insurance premiums by 50% for those beneficiaries who pay for the
 insurance within 3 months foilowing the introduction of the Law on mandatory medical
 assistancei n s m c e fiinds for 2008.
       In order to develop the financial autonomy of the primary medica1assistance service a
 direct contracting procedure of primary medical institutions has been piloted. As such, in
 2007, 19direct primary medica1service providers were contracted, which represents5.1% of
 the total number o f Health Centers, thus reaching the indicator planned for 2009 (uccordhg
 to the Policy Mafrixfnr PRSC'). Starting in Jnnuary 2008, primary medical smice providers
 (100%) shall be directly contracted by the National Medical lnsurance House.
       This year it is planned that at least 25% of family doctors centers with autonomous
 IcgaI status froin the public sector wili be managed by people selected on an open-
 competition basis.
        For the next years the Government will maintain the financing at a minimum level of
 30'36 of allocations for priiiiary medical assistance from the budget for mandatory medical
 assistance insurance.
        At the same time, the Government has committed itself to improving the management
 of the health system. Current reforms in the health sector have given a greater autonomy to
 public medical institutions. In order to make the new model of health functional it is
 necessary to train the managers and there is a need for programmatic training o f
 administratorswho have modern views and outlooks.

 H.     Public procurement

        The creation and maintenanceof an efficient public procurement system could assist
in securing savings of public expenditures. In this respect, starting January 1st 2005, the
decentralization of public procurement system was initiated, which clearly established the
mandates and responsibilities in the process of procurement of public goods, works and
services. This measure has contributed to increasingthe transparencyin thc processof public
pracurement through placement of` ads, publication of relevant information, results, reports,
template files, projects, etc., both in the informative note for public procurement, as we11 as
on the corporatewebsite.
        Public procurement statistics (single source m d public tenders) have maintained a
positive trend evcn in 2005. For the first 6 months of 2007, 8.98% of single source and
70.74% of public tenders were registered by the Agency. The Government intends to carry
out an exerciseofevaluating public procurementusingOECDDAC indicators.
        In order to adjust the legal framework, which regulates public procurement, the
Government o f Moldova, with support from foreign experts, has developed a new law on
pubfie procurement that provides for creation of independent procurement agencies with
staffing and budgetary resources in accordance with the provision o f central public
administration reform. The Law came into effect inOctober 2007.
        The Government wiIi be responsiblefor monitoring the implementation ofthe Lawon
public procurement and shall examine the need and possibilities to ensure de jure
independenceofthe public procurementoversight function.
        In order to facilitate the implementation of thc law, the Govcrnment has appravedan
action plan which indudcs, among others, the drai'ting of legislative acts, consolidation of
capacities and training of pcrsons involved in the process of public procurement, increasing
the transparency and responsibility in public procurement.

  111,    Strengthening Social Protection Systems
                 A.     Finalizing thepernsionsysrem reform
          The 1999 pension system refom has reached its objectives in the medium term: on
  time payment ofpensions, inthe context oflimitedbudgetary transfers. However, despite this
  fact, the pension system reform remains unfinished business. whiisr the Law onpensionshas
  not beenfully implemented.
          ?lie measures undertaken by the Government have included the development of
  individual reports which would allow the calculation o f pensions based on current individual
 contributions. The National House has individual reports from 1999 for all curtent taxpayers,
  with the exception o f individual fmers. We are currently finalizing the implementation
 process ofindividual record-keeping of'taxpayers and social insurancecontributions.
          Attempts were made to improve the medium and long term forecast practices o f
 revenues and expenditures in the social insurance budget. In order to estimate the economic
 andsocial costs of pension system reforms, a set of actuarial models was applied. The use of
 such an instrument will allow for an andysis of the evolution of social expenditures in
 different economic situalions and dit'ferent reform scenarias, increasing the efficiency of
 decisions, identificationofsocial needs itlid priority planning in MTEFand NDS,
          The improventcnt of social protection policies, panicularly the pension system is on
 the Government agenda and includes programs and measures to create unique conditions o f
 retirement for all categories of pensioners through the implenientation of the principle
 regarding the correlation between the size of the pension and the individual contribution for
 each insured person.
          The Government has approved and sent to Parliament the amendments to legislative
 acts which confirm the principle of pension imbursement on the basis o f individual
 contributions.
          The unification strategy for all categories of taxpayerslpensioners is currently being
 finalized. Due to the complexity of this reform there is a need for a broadconsultation ofthis
 document and the incorporation o f best practices to secure the successful accomplishment of
 the strategy. In order to improve the social insurance system the laws on state social
 insurance pensionsand publicsystem of social insurance wit1be furthcr amended.

               B, Increasing the distribution efficiency in the social assistance benefi
         system

           In2007, the Government has undertakena series of actions inorder to consolidate
the multiple social assistance programs. As such. during the Government seating on 3rd
October 2007, the draR Law on social assistance was approved, which aims to provide a
minimum monthly income for socially vulnerable Families through provision of social
assistance, in accordancewith the average gtobal monthly income of the family and the real
needfor social assistance.'The draft law will be submitted to Parliament for approval,

         Ministry of Social Protection plans to approve in 2008 the regulations regarding the
implementatian of the law and targer criteria, in order to start the impEementationof the law
by September2058. The Ministry has to recruit and adequately train the additional personnel
necessary for the managementofthe targetedsocial assistance program.
         'fie design concept of the databasc system was completed. The regulations regding
the implementation of the Law on social assistance will require the collection o f additional
information,  R factorwhichwilt rcquirc an adjustment of technical and funcrional specifications
of the consolidatedsocial assistancedatabase.


                                                                                             16

Public InformationNotice (PIN) No. 08/37
March 18, 2008

Public Information Notices (PINS)form part of the IMF's efforts to promote
transparency of the IMF'sviews and analysis of economic developments and policies.
With the consent of the country (or countries) concerned, PINSare issued after
ExecutiveBoard discussions of Article IV consultationswith member countries, of its
surveillanceof developmentsat the regional level, of post-program monitoring,and of
ex post assessments of member countrieswith longer-term program engagements.
PINSare also issued after Executive Boarddiscussions of general policy matters,
unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

On March 12, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund(IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Republicof Moldova.'
Background
Moldova is doing well, despite a series of consecutive shocks, which includedthe doubling of
the price of imported natural gas andRussia'sbanon imports ofMoldovanwine in2006, anda
severe drought in2007. Growth is estimatedat 5 percent in2007 and i s projected to increaseto 7
percent in2008. Investment i s picking up, and i s beginning to replace remittances as the main
source of growth-an encouraging sign that the earlier model of consumption-driven growth is
changing.
Moldova increasingly faces the challenges experiencedby other transition economies. Improved
growth prospects have come with strong appreciation pressures from foreign exchangeinflows,
and a widening trade deficit. Foreign direct investment (FDI) has pickedup and i s estimatedto
have reached 12 percent of GDP in2007, comparedwith 7 percent in2006.
The mainmacroeconomic concern is inflation, which at 13 percent remains highfor the region.
A deterioration inthe merchandisetrade balancedue to strong import growthhas beenoffset by
improvements innet income and transfers, with a small improvement inthe current account
deficit to 12percent of GDP. A resumption of wine exports to Russia inOctober was a major
positive development, although volumes are likely to recover slowly.
Fiscal policy remainedtight, ending 2007 with a modest deficit of 0.3 percent of GDP. Strong
revenueperformance was driven by robust VAT on imports, while expenditurewas kept inline
with the budget. However, the tax cuts introduced in2008 may underminethe favorable fiscal
position.
Monetary tightening in2007 was complicated by the strong inflow of foreign exchange. The
National Bank of Moldova increasedreserve requirementsfrom 10to 15 percent, and raised
policy interest rates by 2.5 percentagepoints. Nevertheless, the possibility of second-round
effects from the drought, liquidity pressures from growing remittances and FDI, and the
continued strong growth incredit and broad money suggest that upsiderisks to inflation are not
yet fully contained.

 Executive Board Assessment
 Executive Directors welcomed the improved growth prospects and decline inpoverty in
 Moldova, and commendedthe authorities for their reform efforts and balanced macroeconomic
 policies. Developments inMoldova appear to mirror increasingly those inother transition
 economies, with large capital inflows, appreciationpressures on the national currency, and a
 wideningtrade deficit. Directors underscored the importance o fmaintainingmacroeconomic
 stability and improving the business environment to support private sector development and to
 help reverse the emigration o f labor.
 Directors considered that inflation remains highrelative to that inother countries inthe region,
 evenafter accounting for the drought. They cautioned that with strong foreign exchange inflows
 and rapid credit and reserve money growth, upsiderisks to inflation remain. The recent monetary
 tightening by the National Bank o f Moldova (NBM) was welcomed, as was its commitment to
 establish price stability as its sole monetary policy objective. Directors noted that with
 considerably lower labor costs and higherproductivity growth inMoldova compared to the
 region, there i s scope for further exchange rate appreciation without undermining
 competitiveness. They urgedthe central bank to allow greater exchange rate flexibility.

 Directors commended the authorities for their disciplined fiscal policies. Modest deficits are an
 appropriate compromise to balance development and disinflation objectives. Directors welcomed
 the authorities' efforts to strengthen tax administration and to increase social andinvestment

,spending, while maintaining the deficit target. At the same time, they stressedthat the budget
 should remaintight untillow single-digit inflation i s firmly reestablished, and that any spending
 relatedto potential overperformance on the revenue side should be conditional on achieving the
 inflation objective.
 Directors welcomed the authorities' plans for reducing the size o f the public sector, introducing a
 transparent and competitive remuneration system for the public service, and consolidating
 education and health care networks. These were seen as important steps toward a leaner
 government structure to ensure efficient management o f scarce public resources, and to allow
 more room for pro-poor and pro-growth spending.
 Directors welcomed the authorities' commitment to bolster structural reforms aimed at improving
 the investmentclimate and clarifying the role o fthe state inthe economy. They were particularly
 encouraged by the efforts to streamline the business licensing and registration procedures, to
 improve the transparency o f regulatory agencies and reduce redtape, andto strengthen
 bankruptcy procedures and competition legislation. Directors supported the government's
 decision to revitalize the privatizationprocess, including the intentionto sell remaining large
 state enterprises, which would help to reduce the weight of the state inthe economy and provide
 a catalyst for private sector growth.
 Directors considered modernization o f the energy sector as a highpriority. They welcomed the
 strengthenedindependence o fthe energy regulator and establishment o fheat tariffs at a cost
 recovery level, which will be critical for the financial viability o f the utilities. At the same time,
 they stressed that timely introduction o f a newtargeted social assistance scheme will be essential
 to ease the burden o f higher tariffs on the poor.

 Directors noted that the financial sector i s stable, and urgedthe authorities to be vigilant in
 addressing the remaining vulnerabilities inthe sector. Strengthening the supervisory and
 regulatory framework and increasingthe transparency o f bank ownership will be crucial to
 ensure the soundness o f the banking system. Directors welcomed the authorities' efforts to
