MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION, ACTING AS
TRUSTEE FOR THE TRUST FUND FOR BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA,
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT IN THE AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$20 MILLION
TO BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
FOR A WATER, SANITATION AND SOLID WASTE URGENT WORKS PROJECT
1.    I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Credit in an amount
equivalent to US$20 million to Bosnia and Herzegovina to help finance a Water, Sanitation and Solid
Waste Urgent Works Project. The proposed Credit would be on International Development (IDA) terms,
with 40 years maturity, including 10 years of grace. Parallel financing and cofinancing in the amount of
$19.7 million equivalent has already been committed. An additional $30.3 million equivalent is proposed.
Background
2.     Since early 1995, the Bank Group has been deeply involved in developing a donor-funded
reconstruction program for BH. A joint mission of the World Bank, IMF, EU, EBRD, and USAID in late
1995 resulted in the preparation, with the Government, of a priority reconstruction program which was
presented to a donors' meeting, co-sponsored by the Bank and the EU in Brussels on December 20-21,
1995. This program identified some US$5.1 billion of external financing required to meet Bosnia's urgent
reconstruction needs, of which US$1.8 billion would be needed in the first year, 1996. This first donor
meeting led to new donor commitments of some US$500 million for priority reconstruction activities for
the first quarter of 1996. Another donor conference is scheduled for the spring of 1996 to seek financing
pledges from donors for the remainder of 1996 as well as to present needs for the entire reconstruction
program.
3.    The Bank's own assistance strategy for BH consists of a two-track approach: First, prior to
financial normalization and membership in the World Bank Group, the Bank will support selected
immediate assistance programs through the special World Bank Trust Fund for BH (TFBH) in the amount
of US$150 million, approved by the Board of Governors on February 23, 1996. Of these Trust Fund
resources, US$125 million is to be extended at concessional terms identical to those offered by IDA and
US$25 million is to be provided as a grant. Second, once the country becomes a World Bank Group
member and following the clearance of arrears to the Bank, a program of lending and technical assistance
would be initiated to support reconstruction and development, as well as economic transformation. The
current pipeline of operations in CY1996-1997, to be financed both from the Trust Fund for Bosnia and
Herzegovina (TFBH) as well as subsequently from regular World Bank Group resources, comprises a
number of emergency-type projects, including this proposed project and prospective operations in
agriculture, gas, district heating, transport, and war victims rehabilitation, followed by additional projects
in education, health, housing, employment generation, de-mining, electric power supply, forestry and
agricultural services, and a structural adjustment operation in support of structural reforms to enterprises,
banks and public finance.
Sector Issues and Policies
4.    The massive movements of population, and the concentration of people in those parts of BH
considered safer than others have resulted in major problems in the delivery of basic water, sanitation and
solid waste services to the population. Water supplies in many urban centers are grossly inadequate for



- 2 -
the number of people requiring services, leaving many people suffering from  serious privation.
Waterborne diseases are becoming increasingly common, water service is intermittent and water
contamination from  insufficiently treated wastewater remains a constant hazard.  Furthermore,
arrangements for the disposal of s,lid waste have almost collapsed, bringing new health hazards to
citizens.
5.     Bosnia and Herzegovina (the State, comprising the Bosniac-Croat Federation and the Republic of
Srpska) estimates the total sector requirements for restoration of service to prewar levels and upgrading
to meet changed conditions at $950 million. Taking into consideration the implementation capacity of
the existing institutions, the Bank has proposed a 3-year US$380 million program that would be
implemented with three separately financed projects. The proposed Project would be the first one in the
program. It comprises equipment supply, urgent works, strategic planning, institutional strengthening and
preparation of the next project at an estimated cost of US$70 million and would target needs in the
Federation. The second and third projects would in addition, address the needs in the Republic of Srpska.
6.     Water Supply. The quality of water supply service in BH has deteriorated sharply since 1991.
Whereas in the past, piped municipal water supply coverage in most urban areas was good (90% of
population served) and 24 hour service was the norm, now in many areas service is intermittent and water
quality has deteriorated. The main reasons for the deterioration of service have been: (i) increased
demand due to the influx of refugees; (ii) existing water sources having been made inaccessible as a result
of the war; (iii) waste by consumers when water is available because meters are no longer read and bills
are no longer collected; (iv) excessive water leakages in transmission and distribution networks as a result
of lack of maintenance during the war; and (v) direct damage resulting from the war. The lack of
maintenance, the primary cause of today's problems, resulted from constraints on labor and capital during
the hostilities as well as the widespread practice of charging very little for water, so that funds were
generally not available for maintenance. Also, many technicians left, leaving water and sewerage works
organizations understaffed. For example, the Sarajevo Water and Sewerage Works is currently operating
with only one-third of their pre-war staff. While coverage in the pre-war period was good in urban areas,
most rural areas still relied on dug wells or vender supplied water. Piped water supply coverage in rural
areas is only 56% of the population. Thus, a timebound program to introduce water charges, taking into
account peoples' capacity to pay, seems to be an essential precondition for any major investments beyond
the initial "firefighting" effort.
7.     Sewerage. Prior to 1991, BH had made significant progress in developing water borne sewage
collection and treatment systems. Collection system coverage in urban areas averaged 70% as compared
to 90% for water supply. Less than 10% of the rural population was connected to a water borne sewerage
system. Most of the population relied on septic tanks which were satisfactory. Secondary treatment of
wastewater in modern treatment plants was the exception. The largest and most important wastewater
treatment plant is in Sarajevo, but few other towns have made investments beyond screening and grit
removal. As is the case for water distribution, lack of maintenance has also been a problem. Leaky sewer
systems with collectors dating back to 1920 create the potential for contamination of the water system and
nearby aquifers. This lack of maintenance and in some places war damage have contributed to sewer pipe
blockages, sewer pipe breaks, pumping station failures and treatment plant shutdowns. In Vitez, Novi
Travnik and Gornji Vakuf, the sewerage systems are in such poor condition that reconstruction of the
system is the only economic alternative. Geologically, the South-Western region of BH with its sensitive
"karst" area relies heavily on the use of groundwater for water supply, calling for special efforts to avoid
contamination of groundwater aquifers. Rivers used for water supply are also being polluted from
untreated discharges of municipal and industrial wastewater, but this is not a new condition resulting from
the war. Rivers most affected are the Sava, Bosnia, Litvia, Lasva and Vrbas. There is much to be done
towards improving wastewater collection and treatment. In the proposed Project, priority would be given
to the repair and rehabilitation of the collection systems.



- 3 -
8.     Solid Waste. Prior to 1991, most municipalities had fairly well organized waste collection
services, ensuring delivery of solid waste to landfill sites or temporary disposal areas although few of the
sites were properly designed. At present, however service has collapsed in many urban areas because
many garbage trucks were either destroyed or became inoperable due to lack of maintenance and spare
parts. Municipalities that had joint disposal sites before the war, today in some cases, refuse to share
facilities and many divided municipalities have lost access to garbage trucks and containers to handle their
refuse. In many urban areas, restoration of dependable solid waste collection service is as critical as
improving water supply service.
Sector Recovery Program
9.     The sector recovery program is based on planning carried out by the Federation, the International
Management Group (IMG) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The IMG was established in 1993
by the European Union to provide technical assistance to the Federation and the Republic of Srpska for
the restoration of war damaged infrastructure. The Federation's planning is based mostly on requests for
assistance received from municipalities and local sector operating organizations. IMG and the WHO have
carried out a limited number of pre-feasibility studies for water supply rehabilitation projects in Federation
municipalities and have carried out inventories of needs in the Republic of Srpska. The program is
designed to be implemented in three years through three phased country-wide projects. The first project
would comprise urgent works, the second project rehabilitation works, and the third project would consist
of system upgrading works.
10.    The objectives of the program are: (i) to meet the immediate needs of the affected population;
(ii) to return water management facilities to pre-war conditions; (iii) to make selected improvements that
are of a high priority; and (iv) to help establish the institutions needed to sustain the sector over the long
tern. The cost of the program is estimated at $380 million (which works out at approximately $115 per
capita for the population of 3.3 million in the BH). The implementation period is three years.
11.    Under the first project, top priority would be given to urgent works ($60 million)'. The proposed
works would deal with the most serious and urgent needs of the population which can be met quickly (i.e.,
replacement of tools, equipment and repair materials lost or expended since 1991 by local operating
organizations and works which do not require a major lead time for the final design or supply of
equipment). For water supply ($38 million), the Project would provide maintenance equipment to local
water works and make critical on-site repairs of broken water distribution pipes and temporary repairs to
water treatment plants and pumping stations to ensure that clean water is delivered to consumers. For
sanitation ($13 million) the urgent works would cover the provision of equipment for unblocking of sewer
pipes and the replacement of critical sections of collectors, in places where the most serious health hazards
have been identified. For solid waste ($9 million) the works would cover the supply of trucks and
equipment as well as the development of some landfills where needs are identified as critical and major
health risks are assessed.
12.    Following the startup of the first project, rehabilitation works requiring a longer lead time and
more careful preparation would be phased in through a second project ($145 million). For water supply
($66 million), the works would involve repairs to pumping stations, replacement of water mains,
installation of valves and control structures, and setting up stocks of spare parts. For sanitation ($44
million), almost 60% of the required works would be for Sarajevo ($30 million) where a major effort to
restore the sewerage network to its pre-war condition would be implemented through jetting to remove
'Does not include US$10 million for engineering, recurrent costs and planning.



-4 -
blockages, network reconstruction, replacement of pumping equipment and repair of the Sarajevo waste
water treatment plant. The Tmovo waste water treatment plant upstream of Sarajevo would also be
repaired ($8 million). The operation of this plant is important because Tmovo is upstream of Sarajevo
and its sewage if not treated could endanger the quality of Sarajevo's drinking water supply. For solid
waste disposal ($17 million), major landfills would be improved and garbage trucks distributed to the
larger municipalities. For irrigation ($3 million), damaged systems serving consumers that are prepared
to use the water most effectively would be rehabilitated. Finally, for flood control and drainage ($15
million), systems where human life is most at risk would be rehabilitated.
13.   The third project would comprise system upgrading works ($122 million) which would be
introduced in areas where systems are operational but in serious need of upgrading either because their
economic life is coming to an end or because outdated technology is causing unacceptably high operating
costs or inadequate performance. In the water supply sector ($86 million), piped water supply would be
extended to unserved populations, water production and treatment facilities would be expanded, water
distribution networks would be reinforced and administrative buildings would be upgraded. For sanitation
($10 million), primary treatment plants would be constructed where health and environmental benefits are
clearly identifiable. For solid waste ($8 million), the Project would extend the rehabilitation project actions
in land fills and equipment to further locations. Forflood control and drainage ($10 million), the level
of protection of existing systems where the benefits exceed the cost by a wide margin, would be increased.
For irrigation ($8 million), the project would continue the work started under the second project.
14.   In addition to the investments described above, it will be necessary to provide funds in all three
projects for recurrent costs of the local operating organizations and to help establish and build up sector
institutions. This would support the new structure of the country emerging from the peace negotiations.
Clearly significant amounts of equipment (vehicles, office equipment, computers, etc.) will be needed to
support this investment effort and the future management and development of the sector. The estimated
cost of these activities and needs over the three year period is $30 million. This amount will also permit
studies in water management of key river basins to be conducted as well as some basic work on water
strategy planning. Such studies have been identified by government engineers as sorely lacking and
necessary to establish the coherence of the water management effort. The cost of these studies within the
$30 million allowance is estimated to be $4 million. In addition, an allocation of $23 million to cover
the costs of project management, engineering and technical assistance has been included. Out of the $53
million, $10 million would be spent under the first project, $25 million under the second project and $17
million under the third project.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
15.   Sector institutions as well as physical facilities have suffered as a result of the war. Bank
involvement would help to mobilize the resources to restore damaged physical facilities and rebuild the
institutional framework. In addition, the Bank is in the best position to mobilize and coordinate donor
support for the sector and to promote cooperation between the different ethnic groups which currently
divide the sector the same way the population is divided.
The Project
16.   Project Obiectives. The objectives of the Project would be: (i) to restore water, sanitation and
solid waste services to the population depending on pipe water supply and water borne sewerage systems
to a level that would mitigate public health risk in priority areas; (ii) to develop a long term sector strategy
and the details of an emergency program consistent with the strategy; (iii) to rebuild and strengthen sector
institutions so that the improvements will be sustainable; and (iv) prepare final designs and bidding
documents for the rehabilitation project.

17.    Project Description. In line with the Sector Recovery Program and as an integral part of it, the
Project would comprise the urgent works described above, technical assistance and recurrent cost
components. The Project would have five parts. The parts are described as follows:
Part A. The supply of equipment and materials ($15 million). Pipe, fittings, materials, equipment,
spare parts and rolling stock for water, sewerage and solid waste disposal operating
organizations serving about 40 priority municipalities in the Federation, would be supplied
under this part of the Project. The supplied items would be used to meet urgent
requirements for systems operation.  The vehicles, computers, survey and office
equipment required by VBH for project implementation would also be supplied under this
part of the Project.
Part B. Urgent works for the provision of water supply, sanitation and solid waste services for
municipalities ($47 million). The works would comprise rehabilitation and repair of water
sources and water distribution networks, the testing and replacement of meters with the
objective of reducing non-revenue producing water, cleaning of the sewage collection
systems and the repair and/or replacement of broken sewage collectors for serving
Sarajevo, Zenica, Tuzla, Bihac, Travnik and 15 other municipalities.
Part C. Emergency development plan for the water management sector ($0.6 million). The plan
would propose the overall framework, policies and goals of water management in BH as
well as a prioritized list of measures and projects covering all of the Federation's 70
municipalities, in a manner that is consistent with the overall plan. For each measure and
project the cost, technical and financial feasibility would be determined.
Part D. Institutional strengthening ($2.0 million). At the Federation level the technical assistance
and training would focus on strategic planning and sector organization. At the municipal
level, it would focus on project management, financial management, maintenance
management, computer skills and the reduction of unaccounted-for water. Twinning
arrangements with water and sewerage works organizations in donor countries would be
used to the maximum extent possible. The supply of equipment and the financing of
incremental operating costs related to the implementation of the Project would be financed
for VBH and some municipalities with priority needs.
Part E. Preparation of the Water, Sanitation and Solid Waste Rehabilitation Project ($5.0 million).
The scope of work would comprise final designs, procurement documentation and the
contracting of works scheduled for implementation under the Rehabilitation Project. The
works would be identified in the Emergency Plan.
Details on each project component are given in the Technical Annex.
18.    Project Cost and Financing. The cost of the Project net of taxes is estimated at US$70 million.
duties and taxes could add another US$2 million. The Bank Credit would provide 29% of the net
requirement on IDA terms. The rest would comprise cofinancing and/or parallel financing from donors.
The benefitting municipalities would pay only duties and taxes. So far, firm commitments have been
made only by the European Commission (US$14.7 million grant), the Government of Austria (US$3.0
million grant) and the Government of Netherlands (US$2.0 million). Other donors who have expressed
interest are the Government of Japan and the Council of Europe Social Development Fund. Only soft
loans and grants are considered feasible. It is unlikely that the beneficiaries would be able to pay more
than recurrent costs in the near term and some may have difficulty even with these costs. If the financing
gap of $30.3 million is not met, the scope of Part B of the Project would be reduced from 20



- 6 -
municipalities to 8 and the number of sub-projects to be prepared for the next operation would also be
reduced. Because the Project is comprised of about 65 sub-projects in 50 different municipalities, each
designed as an independent project, the Project can be safely be expanded or reduced to meet the available
financing.
19.   Onlending Arrangements. The State would be the Borrower and would onlend the proceeds of
the Credit to the Federation. The Federation, through VBH as its agent, would use the proceeds to
provide credits to the benefitting municipalities under Parts A, B and D of the Project at zero interest, 30
years term including 7 years grace. The credit agreements between the Federation and each benefitting
municipality would provide for a percentage of the amounts received to be forgiven. The percentage
would be determined as soon as the repayment conditions of all financing for the Project is known. It
would be calculated by dividing the amount of grant financing in the financing plan by the total cost of
the Project. It is estimated that about 60% of each municipal credit could be forgiven. The Federation
would consult the Bank before forgiving any part of the credits to the municipalities or making any change
to the onlending terms and conditions.
20.    Cost Recovera. Most water and sewerage works in the Federation have been unable to collect for
their services during the conflict. It would be difficult to reinstate charges in the short term, and it is
unlikely that any municipalities would be able to contribute to the cost of the Project from any other
source except in kind. However, there should be some commitment by the benefitting municipalities to
obtain cost recovery in the future so that they can repay the credits. Therefore, each benefitting
municipality would submit an Action Plan for increasing the revenues for water, sanitation and solid waste
collection services to a level that would permit recovery of operating costs in two years and all costs,
including depreciation, in seven years. The submission of the Action Plans would be a condition of
effectiveness of the credit agreements between Federation and each benefitting municipality.
21.    Proiect Implementation. Municipalities have primary responsibility for the provision of water
supply, sewerage and solid waste services in BH. They provide these services through komunalcos, or
municipal service companies, that function like municipally owned joint stock companies. At present,
most lack the capacity to take full responsibility for implementing their projects. At the federal level, the
responsible ministry is the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and Forestry (MAWRF). The
ministry sets policy and standards and recommends legislation for all water management functions which
are carried out by VODOPRIVREDA BiH (VBH). A Projects Development Department has been
established in VBH with primary responsibility for managing all sector rehabilitation efforts. VBH,
through this department, would have overall responsibility for implementation of the Project. With the
assistance of five IMG advisors, procurement advisors engaged for the Emergency Recovery Project and
consultants, they would prepare the project components, carry out the procurement (except for Part A of
the Project), control the funds and manage the onlending. Most of the procurement for Part A of the
Project, Supply of Equipment and Materials, except for the small Bank-funded component, would be
carried out by an EC project office in Sarajevo. Under Part B of the Project, Urgent Works, the
benefiting municipalities through their komunalcos would be responsible for supervision of the contractors
selected competitively by VBH; however, VBH would provide oversight through their regional offices in
Mostar, Tuzla and Bihac. Most of the goods required for Part B of the Project would be procured by the
contractors as part of the works. For goods procured separately, VBH would seek the assistance of the
procurement unit of the Emergency Recovery Project or employ a procurement agent. To ensure
transparency in the award of contracts a procurement review committee, an adjunct of the MAWRF would
review and approve all contract awards. The technical assistance and training would be carried out by
twinning arrangements with well established foreign water and sewerage companies.
22.    The Federation would like to encourage the development of the local construction and consulting
industry by seeing the engineering and construction work contracted to local firms. The local consulting



firms are for the most part firms comprised individuals who used to work for the design institutes that did
most of the engineering work in former Yugoslavia. Individuals and small finns from Croatia and
Slovenia are also expected to be competitive and win contracts for some of the engineering consulting
assignments.  Local contractors and contractors from Croatia and Slovenia have good prospects to win
a large percentage of the works contracts because of their local knowledge and the fact that most of the
bid packages would be too small to interest foreign contractors. The local contractors would comprise
recently formed firms founded by local entrepreneurs who use to work for the large construction institutes
that did most of the work in former Yugoslavia. Many of these new groups are supported technically and
financially by foreign construction companies.
23.    Project preparation with the assistance of IMG is ongoing. All the goods, equipment and
investment type works to be procured under Part A of the Project have been identified and specifications
are being prepared by procurement agents. A Dutch consulting firm satisfactory to the Bank has been
contracted for the emergency assistance plan. The firm started work in mid-February. Local and foreign
consultants still need to be hired to prepare detailed designs and bidding documents for about 50% of the
works.
24.    Agreements Reached. Agreement was reached on the following during negotiations:
a.     onlending arrangements and terms between BH, the Federation and the benefitting
municipalities;
b.    the preparation of Action Plans by the benefitting municipalities for achieving recovery
of operating costs in the short term and full cost recovery in the long term;
c.     criteria for the selection and prioritization of municicipalities that would benefit from the
Project;
d.    the establishment of a procurement review committee to ensure compliance with donor
procurement procedures and to approve all contract awards;
e.     percentages of expenditures to be financed from the Credit; and
f.     accounting, reporting and auditing requirements.
25.    Conditions of Effectiveness. The following would be conditions of effectiveness:
a.    the execution of a subsidiary finance agreement between BH and the Federation; and
b.    the establishment of the Procurement Review Committee.
26.    Environmental Aspects. The Project would have positive environmental impacts as a result of a
reduction in water losses, a safer water supply, improved sewage collection and proper disposal of solid
waste.  There is no resettlement involved. In addition, all work would be monitored during Bank
supervision missions to ensure that there is no degradation to the environment. In project components that
include the extension or improvement of sewage collection systems, special care will be taken to mitigate
the effects of concentrating sewage discharges so that surface water and ground water sources used for
public water supply are not endangered. The Project has been placed in environmental screening category
"B".



27.    Participatory Technigues. While survey based inputs have not been sought from individuals
residing in the municipalities, all project components that have been identified are based on requests
received from the municipalities. Since the Project comprises urgent, rehabilitative needs that are aimed
at restoring service to basic levels, it should be safe to assume that the priorities assigned by the
municipalities are broadly reflective of the needs of the populace that they represent.
28.    Benefits. The principal benefit of the Project would be to restore essential urban water, sanitation
and solid waste disposal services to levels that would make urban centers liveable, eliminate health risks
and support a return of economic activity. The emergency development plan would provide a long term
strategy for sector development and a framework for the rehabilitation efforts that would be consistent
with the strategy.
29.    Risks. Project risks include a resumption of hostilities in the region and a possible delay in
economic revitalization of the country. However, as for reconstruction investments in all economic
sectors, these risks have been accepted by the international donor community as the Dayton peace
agreement is being implemented in its first year. Other risks relate to (i) implementation capacity--many
of the most qualified staff of VBH and of the operating organizations in the municipalities have left; (ii)
cost recovery--under the current economic climate, consumers lack the ability to pay for basic services,
even for the cost of operation; (iii) lack of cooperation between different ethnic groups--in ethnically
divided communities, lack of agreement on priorities and technical solutions could delay implementation
and result in uneconomic solutions; and (iv) financing gap--it is possible that the financing gap will not
be filled. The risks are manageable with greater than normal level of technical assistance, initial financing
of recurrent costs and close supervision by the Bank and donor agencies. With regards to the financing
gap, the Project is comprised of about 65 sub-projects in 50 different municipalities, each designed as an
independent project so that the realization of benefits from all expenditures would be achieved even if not
all the anticipated funding is realized and only part of the project can be undertaken.
30.    Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit will comply with the Resolutions of the
Executive Directors of IBRD (Resolution No. 96-1) and IDA (Resolution No. IDA 96-1) establishing the
Trust Fund for Bosnia and Herzegovina and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
