Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
This project is a follow-up of the PROMIN I project, a successful on-going operation. Currently under implementation in
ten provinces, PROMIN I has started to introduce significant modifications and improvements in the primary health care model in
Argentina. It is well-targeted to poor women and children, the most vulnerable group, especially in a period of economic adjustment.
The proposed PROMIN II project would help extend the coverage of the PROMIN program and would have the same objective of
improving maternal and child health status. The project would help the Government: (i) increase coverage of maternal and prenatal
care services to 60 percent; (ii) increase pediatric coverage of children aged 0-6 to 60 percent; (iii) transform 40 percent of existing
child feeding centers and kindergartens into early childhood development centers; and (iv) decentralize and strengthen social service
management.
PROMIN II would also have the demand-driven nature of PROM1N I in the sense that provinces would request subprojects,
and those implementing a subproject more efficiently would have access to more funds out of a common unallocated pool. An
important change in the design of the second project is the introduction of a mid-term review for all subprojects. This is included in
the Operational Manual and will be carried out by the PCU. Disbursements for the second part of subprojects will be contingent upon
performance under the first part. In case of poor performance, undisbursed balances would be transferred to a 'conunon fund" to
which better-performing provinces would have access. This modality has already proved instrumental in the turnaround of Norheast
Basic Health Services I and II projects in Brazil and their accelerated implementation after this change was introduced.
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description , Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown, and Annex 5 for
financing plan):

SUBPROJECTS. They would be sponsored by provinces or municipalities using                160.9          94.1
PROMIN's eligibility criteria (Annex 2b). Subprojects would include: (i) maternal,
child health and nutrition activities to reinforce the capacity of maternal and child
health and nutrition programs to provide appropriate and timely care to low-
income mothers and children, on an ambulatory basis and in maternity wards and    Physical,
neonatal units of local hospitals; (ii) early childhood development and nutrition  policy,
activities to support the mental and social development of children below 6 years  institution-
old; and (iii) institutional strengthening to enhance the capacity of provinces and    building
municipalities to plan, manage, and implement mother and child-related activities.
Subprojects would finance rehabilitation and construction of infrastructure,
equipment, training, technical assistance, and incremental recurrent costs (the
latter to be financed by the Government). As part of institutional strengthening,
each province would present a technical assistance subproject to help improve the
implementation of on-going nutrition programs ('Daci6n de Leche') sponsored by
the Ministry of Health (MOH), and when appropriate, other nutrition programs, in
the provinces. The project would require all participating provinces to implement
the same basic health, nutrition, and early childhood development package.

3. Benefits and Taret Population
The project would increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the health sector by improving: (i) primary health care infrscture
and equipment; and (ii) management of primary health care facilities, that would result in an improved referral system and a better
problem-solving capacity at the local level. The project would also produce benefits to the population in terms of improved
productivity resulting from a healthier, more capable and reliable work force, and reflected in lower absenteeism. Infrastructure
improvements in ambulatory services would lead to significant improvements in the quality of care provided to the population of

the participating provinces. The project would also improve the growth and development of children under six years old, thereby
reducing the consequences of disadvantaged conditions that are associated with student failure.
The total beneficiary population is estimated at 1,790,000, including 70,000 pregnant women, 55,000 children below one
year of age and 250,000 children aged 2 to 5. The project would be implemented in at least 20 poor municipalities in 17 provinces,
including notably Buenos Aires, Catamarca, Chaco, Chubut, Cordoba, Corrientes, Entre Rios, Formosa, Jujuy, La Rioja, Mendoza,
Misiones, Neuquen, Rio Negro, Salta, Sante Fe, Santiago del Estero, and Tucuman.
The PROMIN II project would be implemented in provinces with eligible subprojects, including those provinces already
participating in PROMIN I. In the latter case, the project would be implemented in new municipalities with a large number of poor
as well as unsatisfactory quality and supply of primary health care and early childhood development. The project would be
implemented principally in urban areas where there is the highest concentration of poor. Some pilot programs in rural areas may be
considered in later years. -- - -                                                                              _
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: 6 years
Executing agencies. The project would be executed by the MOH through a Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) assisted by
provincial and municipal executing units. The same PCU that has been effective in coordinating the implementation of PROMIN I
would be responsible for PROMIN II. The General Coordinator of PROMIN is directly responsible to the Vice-Minister of Health.
The Minister himself closely monitors PROMIN, which is one of the flagship programs of the Ministry. The PCU would: (i) guide
and coordinate project implementation; (ii) provide technical assistance to the provincial and municipal subproject units, (iii)
monitor and supervise the implementation of subprojects; and (iv) help design and approve technical proposals for the institutional
strengthening component. Coordinators of provincial units and their staff (UEPs) are appointed by the provincial Governments and
have their full confidence. PROMIN is consulted in the process. UEPs' offices are usually located within the premises of the
ministries. About 75 percent of the staff are paid by the provinces and the balance by PROMIN. The latter usually finances the
procurement and administrative staff who need not be maintained once the project is completed. Provinces pay the medical and
educational staff whose capacity will significantly increase under the project, and who will remain valuable assets for the provinces
in the long-run.
Operational Manual. Conditions for project implementation are included in the Operational Manual which was reviewed
and found satisfactory.
Accounting, financial reporting, and auditing arrangements. The financial administration of the project (including
contracting and disbursement) would be coordinated by the PCU, which would disburse funds directly to provinces or municipalities
or through a third party (e.g. UNDP). To facilitate disbursements, a Special Account with a 90-day advance will be established. The
project will be audited annually by independent auditing agencies acceptable to the Bank.
Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements. The PCU would be responsible for project monitoring and analysis. The
technical supervision of the subprojects would be carried out by provinces or municipalities supported, when necessary, by
consultants. Progress reports, including monitoring indicators, will be sent by the PCU to the Bank every six months.

Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project:
Document number and date of latest CAS discussion: Coutntry Assistance Strategyfor the Argentine Republic, Report No.
14278-AR discussed by the Board on May 4, 1995, with Progress Report discussed on April 25, 1996.
The proposed project would directly support the CAS' objectives of reducing poverty and improving the efficiency and
targeting of social services. By addressing primary health care, the project is a centerpiece of the Bank's strategy in the health sector
in Argentina. As envisaged in the CAS, the project would complement the Provincial Health Development project (Ln. 3931-AR)
which is helping improve the organization and management of hospitals, and the Health Insurance Reform project (Ln. 4002/3-AR),
which is helping improve the financing of the sector. The project is especially important because it is directly targeted to the poorest
30 percent of the population who do not benefit from health insurance or cannot afford private health care. It is part of the
Government's overall safety net program and helps cushion the effects of unemployment and economic adjustment.
In the April 25, 1996 CAS Progress Report discussion at the Board, the Executive Directors expressed their concern over
the level of unemployment and urged the Bank to continue supporting Government efforts to improve labor markets and strengthen
the delivery of social services in health and education to the poorer segments of society.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Health and Early Childhood Development Issues. In many respects, Argentina already possesses a highly developed health
system, particularly by developing country standards. The country has one of the highest doctor-to-population ratios in Latin
America (nearly three doctors per thousand inhabitants), while the number of hospital beds (4.5 per thousand inhabitants) is similar
to that of many OECD countries. As in most middle-income countries, Argentina shows two coexisting epidemiological profiles: (i)
a high incidence of non-communicable and degenerative diseases (including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes), and a
rapid increase in accidents, corresponding to the profile of industrial countries; and (ii), a high incidence of infectious and parasitic
diseases, reflecting conditions usually prevailing in developing countries.
Despite its achievements, the health system still faces significant problems. The infant mortality rate (IMR) of 22 per 1000
live births is higher than in Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Uruguay, which have lower per-capita incomes and spend less on
health. There are major variations in the IMR across regions: the IMR is 1.1-1.3 times higher in the large, poor, periurban areas
than the national average. Three-fourths of neonatal deaths and 60 percent of post-neonatal deaths are concentrated among the poor.
Neonatal deaths result from poor quality obstetric care and maternal undernutrition. Post-neonatal deaths are caused by
immunopreventable and acute respiratory diseases. They could be prevented through opportune health care interventions and better
nutrition. The same applies to mortality for children aged 1-4 (where some of the main causes of death are infectious and parasitic
diseases, influenza, and pneumonia) and maternal mortality, where two-thirds of deaths (related to induced abortion, hemorrhage,
and toxemia) could be prevented by opportune, good quality care. At present, prenatal care coverage remains low. When deliveries
take place in the hospital, they still often occur far from the mother's residence (this represents 30 percent of the cases in Buenos
Aires).
Health care has deteriorated over the last two decades. With the exception of incipient progress in the areas covered by
PROMIIN I, public services are overburdened and poorly equipped to handle the volume of demand, especially in the poor provinces
of the North and Northwest, and in densely populated periurban areas. In some areas, there is increasing pressure on health services
resulting from immigrants in provinces bordering Paraguay, Bolivia, and Chile. Lack of priorities, operating standards, incentives,
and accountability affect most provincial services. Poorly trained and utilized health personnel are major causes of inefficiency. As a
result of economic recession and unemployment, many families have lost their social benefits and have to be assisted by the public
sector. Mothers and children have suffered the effects of the economic crisis more than other members of poor households. This is
because: (i) poor households contain on average more than twice as many children as other households; and (ii) undernourishment
tends to affect mothers and children disproportionately.
As a result of the deterioration in the quality of primary health care, many patients go directly to hospitals, creating
congestion in these services. However, treating simple ailments in hospitals is not cost-effective as it involves the use of specialists,
and sophisticated infrastructure and equipment. To help solve this problem, it is important to continue improving the quality of care
at the primary level, through the implementation of a more efficient delivery model, complemented by a strengthening of maternal
and child care in hospitals.
The number of pre-school-age children with unsatisfied basic needs (related to housing, hygiene, access to safe
water, and health care) is estimated at 1.5 million. Of these, about one-third receive nutrition supplementation through provincial

and municipal kindergartens, mothers' clubs, and other public and private channels. Even this limited assistance is often not well
planned or supervised. The widely differing organizational arrangements and jurisdictions responsible for this age group in
provinces and municipalities, together with low private sector participation, hinder efforts to rationalize and expand services. With
the exception of those who have started to be covered by PROMIN I, very few preschoolers from poor families receive psycho-social
stimulation. This makes entry in schools more difficult and increases the rates of repetition and dropout.
Health Sector Strategv. As described in its policy letter of March 26, 1996 (linked to the Health Insurance Reform project), the
Government's general objectives for the health sector are:
(i) to ensure full exercise of the population's right to health care;
(ii) to improve the accessibility, efficiency and quality of medical attention;
(iii) to reduce avoidable morbidity and mortality risks; and
(iv) to rethink and redirect the role of the State in the health sector.
To reach those objectives, the following sector strategies were defined:
(i) give priority to mother and infant care;
(ii) modernize the public hospital system; and
(iii) improve the financing of the system.
With regard to the first strategy, already being implemented under PROMIN I, the more detailed objectives are: lowering
infant mortality and morbidity rates, strengthening the primary care system, stimulating psychosocial development in children,
redefining nutritional strategies associated with the health of the general population, establishing indicators to monitor the
population covered by the program, increasing the number of checkups during pregnancy, and significantly lowering adverse
outcomes such as low birth-weight.
Nutrition Issues. Information about nutrition status in Argentina is not up to date. The MOH has estimated that, by the mid-1990s,
25 percent of children under 5 years of age were below the tenth percentile in terms of height-for-age. A household survey performed
by the National Institute for Statistics and Census (INDEC) during 1995 shows that in the Greater Buenos Aires area 17 percent of
children of poor households were below the tenth percentile in terms of height-for-age. In the early 1990s, a small sample survey of
pregnant women in a poor area of the province of Buenos Aires indicated that in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy about
20 percent of the women were under weight, and at the third trimester about 30 percent, according to weight/height criteria. Under
'PROMIN I, a National Nutrition Survey will be undertaken.
Nutrition Strategy. There are currently nine nutrition programs costing US$332 million per year'. Two of these programs (Milk for
pregnant women and malnourished infants - "Daci6n de Leche"; and PROMIN) come under the MOH. The seven other programs
depend on SDS and are by far the largest, representing 90 percent of total funds. These programs do cover the most vulnerable
groups in Argentina: pregnant and lactating women, infants, and young children, and the elderly. They are implemented in a
decentralized way in the provinces and food is purchased locally. However, they do face significant implementation problems: (i)
there is a lack of clear targeting criteria; (ii) there is an absence of monitoring indicators and program evaluation; and (iii) there is a
lack of regularity in the transfer of funds to the provinces. In the context of its dialogue with Argentina on social programs, the Bank
has already started, through the Social Protection Project (Ln. 3957-AR), to discuss the need to improve the implementation of the
nutrition programs under the responsibility of SDS. In 1995, the Government created a Central Unit to Analyze and Plan Food and
Nutrition Policies (UCAPPAN) within the Secretariat of Social Development (SDS). This institution is receiving technical assistance
from IDB. Under the project, each province would benefit from a technical assistance subproject to help improve the implementation
of on-going MOH-sponsored nutrition programs ("Daci6n de Leche") in the provinces.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The project would help improve maternal and child health care and early childhood development by helping the provinces deliver
better-quality health and nutrition services. The project would help expand the scope of the PROMIIN program to vulnerable groups
in areas in which the greater concentration of poor exists. The project would build upon the Govermnent's decentralized demand-
driven approach, which provides the necessary flexibility to adjust interventions to local needs and conditions while maintaining
targeting and financial control mechanisms to ensure efficient use of resources. Given its public goods nature, as well as for equity
reasons, basic health, nutrition, and early childhood development services under the project would be delivered by provincial and
municipal Governments. The rehabilitation and construction of facilities would be contracted to the private sector. Linkages would
continue to be developed with NGOs and local associations. The proposed project would support the Government's decentralization
efforts through the implementation of subprojects by local governments.

8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
*  Fund Approach. One alternative design would have been a top-down, filly-detailed blueprint design. However, in the context
of this project, a blueprint project for each province would have been too rigid. It could have resulted in non-performance by
some provinces or municipalities on account of changes in the fiscal and political situation, causing changes in priorities and
rotation of key personnel. Instead, the project is designed as a broad common fund to finance a basic program of services
(already demonstrated to be effective under PROMIN I) according to an agreed set of criteria and procedures. This allows better-
performing provinces to move faster in project implementation and have access to additional resources, which introduces an
element of competition and makes implementation more efficient. Technical assistance will be provided to help weaker
provinces.
* Size. The second alternative would have been a larger project. However, this may have put excessive pressure on the
institutional capacity in Argentina and would have increased project risk. A size considered reasonable is that of a project that
will approximately double the scope of the PROMIN program. This will allow the program to be present in more than 75
percent of the provinces and allow it to have a significant impact on the primary health care system. It responds directly to the
request of the MOH. As the program is highly decentralized and implemented directly by the provinces and municipalities, the
experience under PROMIN I shows that such an expansion is feasible. Project management is strong, and there is now
significant decentralization of decision-making to the provinces. During the initial 12-18 months, the Federal PCU will be
implementing both the PROMIN I and PROMIN II projects. This is considered feasible as the PCU's productivity has improved
and a 'horizontal cooperation" system has been introduced whereby more advanced provinces and municipalities provide
technical assistance to poorer ones, i.e. those which usually have less institutional capacity. As some provinces will be weaker
and will need more assistance, entrance of new provinces would be phased under PROMIN II. An important part of the
evaluation of a subproject is an assessment of the design of its provincial or municipal executing unit and the quality of its
staffing. In addition, the project benefits from a strong element of social participation. In all PROMIN subprojects, health
workers, beneficiaries, NGOs, government institutions, and other actors are closely involved in the project design and
implementation. This allows PROMIN coordinating and executing units to leverage themselves. It also ensures better
sustainability. Thus, doubling the PROMIN program is considered feasible.

PROMIN I has been helping the health system to evolve from a passive to a managed system in which efforts are made to find out
who the clients are, what services they need, and what numerical targets can be used to stimulate performance. Visits to health
facilities show strong attendance by patients, availability of drugs and medical supplies, and a motivated health staff delivering
integrated services. The program focuses on cost-effective intenrentions, and is already starting to have a significant impact. For
example, in Florencio Varela (a very poor area of Buenos Aires), in only one year, obstetric and pediatric coverages have increased
by 50 and 41 percent respectively. This is being achieved by: (i) reinforcing the concept of integrated health care and changing the
focus from treatment of the most apparent illness to overall assessment of the mothers and children's health; (ii) strengthening the
primary health care level, and improving its capacity to resolve the most frequent problems affecting mothers' and children's health;
(in) improving equity in access to health care; and (iv) strengthening community participation through health education and social
communication. Project management is strong and there is now significant decentralization of decision-making to the provinces,
process times have been reduced, and the Project Coordinating Unit's (PCU) preparation and evaluation functions have been
separated to improve efficiency. A number of supervision tasks are now being contracted out.
Administrative costs are currently on the high side, but are expected to decline significantly. Accumulated administrative
costs (PCU and provincial units) currently represent 18 percent of total disbursements. However, as disbursements progress and



Project Concept Document                                                                                 Page 7
Country: Argentina                                                                   Maternal & Child Health & Nutriton 11
PROMIN II starts to be implemented in late 1997, fixed and semi-variable costs will be spread over a larger volume of
disbursements. They are projected to reach 12 percent by the end of PROMIN I (1999) and 6 percent by the end of PROMIN II
(2001). There will be a 1-2 year overlap between PROMIN I and 11 (1997-1999), a period during which the administrative costs will
be spread over two projects.
Disbursements have significantly improved over the past 12 months and had reached US$47.1 million as of March 31, 1997. But
why start PROMIN II if PROMIN I is not yet fully disbursed? This is because more than 80 percent of the funds have been
committed through subproject agreements with provinces. PROMIN is a very popular program in Argentina. It is well regarded by
the public and the press, and there is strong pressure from other provinces to participate in this technically-sound program. An
amendment was made to PROMIN I to allow new provinces to enter, and subprojects have started in Jujuy, Misiones, and Formosa,
but new commitments cannot be made until there is reasonable assurance that the PROMIN II project will go forward. By the time
PROMIN II becomes effective, a large portion of the PROMIN I loan will have been disbursed. There will be a relatively short period
(12-18 months) of overlap of PROMIN I and II. Moreover, PROMIN II will start and duplicate the same program in other provinces
(not included in the first) so there will be room for expansion and use of the new funds from the start.
10. Lessons learned and reflected in proposed project design:
The lessons learned from PROMIN I are:
(i) The degree of targeting was about right. PROMIN I covered municipalities in which the number of poor represent at
least 30 percent. This is a floor, and actual numbers vary across the provinces (e.g., 56 percent of Formosa's population is classified
as poor). This level of targeting allows a significant number of poor to benefit from a subproject, and covers a critical mass of health
facilities (e.g., one hospital and 25 health centers). Yet, it ensures that project funds benefit the poorest who are the most affected
during a period of economic adjustment. PROMIN II aims at the same degree of targeting. The project design also contemplates a
pilot program to improve maternal and child health care in rural areas.
(ii) The design was flexible. PROMIN I follows a demand-driven, fund-type approach whereby funds are allocated to
different provinces on the basis of agreed criteria, and subprojects are presented in a participatory approach by the beneficiaries
themselves. This transfers the burden of subproject preparation from the centralized state bureaucracy, which often has limited
capacity, to beneficiaries, and ensures their ownership. Technical assistance is provided to less-advanced provinces. This fund-type
mechanism will also be used for PROMIN II.
(iii) Project implementation arrangements have been successful. Provinces manage the subprojects directly through a
provincial implementation unit. An overall Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) at the Federal level coordinates project implementation
and ensures the link with overall policy objectives of the Ministry. For the proposed project, implementation would continue to
follow the PROMIN I arrangements.
(iv) The proper technical model has been applied. Since inception, the PROMIN program has been applying a delivery
model that follows the concept of the integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI), which is widely recommended by the
Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO) (details in section 15).
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The main indications are: (i) satisfactory implementation of PROMIN I; (ii) the Borrower taking the lead in project preparation n
and implementation planning; and (iii) the Government's repeated requests for a follow-up project stemming from (a) the
demonstrated success of the first operation, (b) pressure on the MOH from the provinces not participating in PROMIN I, and (c) the
PROMIN program being seen as an essential tool to improve service delivery at the primary level, thus complementing reforms to
modernize the financing of the sector and make hospitals more efficient.
12. Value added of Bank support:
Bank support:
*  has helped transfer the experience from similar projects worldwide, both in the technical design of the project and in the
introduction of implementation arrangements that ensure a successful operation;
* would provide stronger oversight on the use of funds, consistent with Bank procurement and disbursement guidelines;
* would permit on-going evaluation of the project during project implementation. and adjustments, if necessary; and
* would facilitate coordination with other health and poverty reduction programs.
*  Expected continuity of Task Manager and team members with appropriate skill mix will help project implementation.

Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detaled aessnments are in Uthe project Me. See Annex 8)
13. Economic Assessment (see Annex 4)   Z  Cost-Benefit Analysis:      ] Cost-Effectiveness Analysis    [I] Other
NPV=US$271 million; IERR=40 percent
The project has an estimated net present value (NPV) of US$271 million and an internal economic rate of return (IERR) of
40 percent. The rate of return would be even higher if additional project benefits not amenable to quantification in monetary terms
could have been included.
Results of risk/sensitivity analysis show that a two-year delay in the start-up of project implementation would reduce the
NPV to US$94 million and the IERR to 28 percent. A 20 percent reduction in benefits combined with a two-year delay would reduce
the NPV to US$53 million and the IERR to 15 percent. Under both scenarios, benefits would remain strong.
The fiscal impact of the project would be negative because in the purely public sector (22 percent of total spending), in
which PROMIN operates, there are no charges for services in basic health centers and hospitals. In the context of the present
economic difficulties, the introduction of fees at the primary level would not make sense because: (i) it would certainly reduce the
demand for health services by the poor; and (ii) it appears politically infeasible. However, the fiscal impact would be reduced
because there is a high degree of voluntarism in early childhood development centers, in which about half the staff (representing
about 30 percent of total operating costs) is expected to be voluntary as has been the case under PROMIN I.
More than three quarters of health spending in Argentina involves cost recovery: (i) private sector spending, which
represents 42 percent of total spending; and (ii) health insurance funds in which employee and employers' contributions total 36
percent of health spending.
14. Financial Assessment:
PROMIN's financial management (including accounting and auditing) capacity has been reviewed and found satisfactory.
The total recurrent expenditures of the PROMIN II project (an average of about US$3 million per year as shown in Annex
5) would not account for a significant percentage of either total or health spending at the provincial level. As a share of existing
health expenditure levels, the recurrent costs would range from under 0.6 percent to just over 3 percent of provincial health
spending. In terms of total provincial spending, recurrent expenditures would not exceed 0.4 percent in any of the project's
provinces.
The availability of counterpart funds has not been a problem under PROMiIN I and is not expected to be one under
PROMIN II. Given that provinces do cofinance subprojects for personnel, drugs, and supplies, the institutional and fiscal capacity of
participating provinces is reviewed as part of the evaluation of subprojects. In an extreme case, should a province experience
unforeseen financial problems, project funds could be reassigned to other provinces, which would allow the overall implementation
of the program to proceed.
15. Technical Assessment:
Within a broader spectrum of activities, the PROMIN program applies the concept of the integrated management of
childhood illness (IMCI). This intervention is widely recommended by the Bank and WHO as one of the most cost-effective public
health interventions and clinical services. IMCI is a strategy to provide universal access to the population to basic health services for
children. It includes health promotion and prevention as well as individual control and treatment of the major health problems and
diseases affecting children. IMCI's objective is to focus on the most prevalent health problems affecting children: acute respiratory
infections (ARI), acute diarrheal diseases (ADD), malnutrition, malaria and diseases preventable by vaccination (notably measles).
The implementation of the IMCI strategy would help to: (i) reinforce the concept of integrated health care and change the
focus from treatment of the most apparent illness to overall assessment of the child's health; (ii) strengthen the primary health care
level, improving its capacity to resolve the most frequent problems affecting the child's health; (iii) improve equity in access to
health care; and (iv) strengthen community participation through health education and social conununication.
All of the above have represented the core objectives of the PROMIN program since its inception in November 1993. The specific
objectives of IMCI (reduce mortality of children under 5, reduce occurrence and seriousness of ARI, ADD and measles, and

Country: Argentina                                                                    Maternal & Child Health & Nutrition 11
improve quality of health care services provided to children in health facilities) are the same as the objectives of PROMIN.
PROMIN goes beyond IMCI. In addition to the above objectives, PROMIN addresses the health of mothers, pregnant
women, nutritional problems of mothers and children both at the health center and hospital levels, as well as aspects of childhood
development through Early Childhood Development Centers (ECDC). The quality of these preventive measures has been
strengthened through in-service training and social communication.
An analysis of the most prevalent diseases in Argentina shows that the main problem is ARI. There is a low prevalence
of measles which is concentrated in a few rural areas, a low level of acute diarrheal disease, and there is no malaria. Malnutrition
figures are not up to date, which is why a National Nutrition Survey will be carried out in 1997. As Argentina's epidemiological
profile varies across provinces, PROMIN has adapted its strategy to local needs.
Different country experiences have demonstrated that the effective early childhood development programs are those that
combine early learning with nutrition programs in early childhood development centers, and operate in close coordination with
health centers. This is precisely the model followed by the PROMIN program.
16. Institutional Assessment:
Project management capacity both at the Federal and provincial level has been developed during PROMIN I, and is
adequate. The capability of the Federal PCU to coordinate an expanded PROMIN program has been assessed. and found adequate.
Institutional capacity of new participating provinces and municipalities is reviewed as part of subproject preparation and a technical
assistance program is designed and included as part of each subproject to strengthen their institutional capacity during subproject
implementation.
PROMIN's procurement staff is strong and well-recognized by the Bank. PROMIN staff is regularly asked to participate
in procurement courses given to staff of other Bank-financed projects in Argentina. The first-year program has been prepared and is
ready for implementation (a detailed procurement schedule is presented in Annex 6). Supervision of civil works construction is well
organized. The quality of infrastructure financed under PROMIN I is good.
The monitoring and evaluation system is being improved. During the past 18 months, PROMIN has been installing a
system of progress, implementation, and impact indicators (for details of indicators used, see Annex 1; for examples of actual
indicators measured, see "Documents in Project File - PROMIN I at-a-glance).
17. Social Assessment
The project involves a high degree of conununity participation, which will help improve the quality and sustainability of
subprojects. More details are provided in 'Community Participation in PROMIN' (Documents in Project File). The project has a
very clear gender focus: about 75% of beneficiaries are women and girls.
18. Environmental Assessment            Environmental Category - -  A   -          B -l C
It is expected that the execution of the components of the project will not cause any substantial environmental impact and
therefore will be classified within Category 'B." For the purpose of controlling and preventing any particular situation, the wastes
of the health centers, regional health centers (CRRs), hospitals and early childhood development centers (CDCs) will be collected
and disposed of in an adequate manner. The infrastructure and equipment components consider elements of environmental health
which will be taken into consideration in the formulation of the subprojects (e.g. construction of incinerators, crematory ovens,
septic tanks, etc.). A guide for the formulation and evaluation of environmental aspects with sections on diagnosis, interpretation
and prevention of situations will form part of the Operational Manual.

The PROMIN program is highly participatory. Community participants are usually involved through all the steps of the
subproject cycle from identification to evaluation. During subproject preparation, PROMIN promotes the involvement of subproject
beneficiaries, local representatives, NGOs, subproject workers, and the community-at-large in the diagnosis of problems and in the
design of solutions. Beneficiaries are formally involved in the planning and evaluation of subproject activities at the local level
through community organizations, such as groups of mothers and parents, and groups of children and adolescents. These groups
work closely with health, education, and social action institutions. Training is provided by PROMIN for the management of the
subproject. At the start of a subproject, an Advisory Council is usually established, composed of representative leaders from the
community who have participated in workshops during subproject identification. At the end of a subproject, beneficiaries participate
in the evaluation of subproject performance compared to its objectives.
20. Sustainability
Incremental recurrent expenditures would be incurred to provide health facilities and child development centers with the
necessary inputs in personnel as well as goods and materials. Redeployment of personnel rather than hiring of additional staff is
emphasized under the project. The hiring of additional staff, when redeployment of personnel is not feasible, and the development of
support services would be based on a gradual phase-in of project activities. Provincial and municipal incremental recurrent
expenditures would be financed by the federal government on a declining basis. Specifically, incremental recurrent purchases of
food, drugs, and other materials, and incremental recurrent salaries would be financed as follows: 100 percent, 70 percent, and 30
percent during the first, second, and third year of implementation by the federal government, and the balance, as well as all
incremental costs beginning in year four, out of provincial and municipal budgets. This would be specified in the subsidiary
agreements between the MOH and the provinces.

ANNEX 2 a
Detailed Project Description
Component 1 - Provincial and Municipal Subprojects (US$160.9 million, 94.1% of project
costs)
Subprojects would include (i) maternal, child health and nutrition; (ii) early childhood
development; and (iii) institutional strengthening.
Maternal and Child Health and Nutrition activities cover: (a) women's reproductive
and child health care; (b) food supplementation for undernourished pregnant women and children
under 6 years of age, as well as for lactating mothers; and (c) health and nutrition education and
promotion, and environmental health. The project would finance the expansion, refurbishing,
equipping of existing health facilities and laboratories, hiring additional staff to complement
existing health and management teams when staff redeployment is not feasible, purchasing drugs,
medical supplies, and food supplements. Funds would also be allocated for staff supervision,
maintenance, and health and nutrition education and promotion.
The women's reproductive health care program would cover: pre-natal controls,
including nutrition surveillance of pregnant women and detection of possible gestation and
delivery complications; tetanus vaccination; child delivery; newborn reception; post-partum care;
breastfeeding promotion; birth spacing; control and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases;
oral health, violence prevention, injury control and treatment, and cervical and breast cancer
screening.
The child health care program would help reduce child mortality and morbidity through
infant care, growth monitoring, breastfeeding promotion, vaccination against measles, diphtheria,
pertussis, polio, tuberculosis, tetanus, oral rehydration therapy, prevention and early treatment of
gastrointestinal and acute respiratory diseases, as well as oral health, violence prevention, injury
control and treatment.
The supplementary feeding program would reinforce the impact of health-related
interventions on poor health and malnutrition among children under six years of age and pregnant
and lactating women. It would be a key instrument for attracting the population to preventive
services, and for the rehabilitation of malnourished children and mothers. Targeting of
malnourished individuals with a reinforced food supplementation scheme would be done through
a program to monitor weight changes during pregnancy and childhood in local health facilities. In
addition, breastfeeding practices would be monitored to allocate food supplementation to
lactating women. Once identified, targeted individuals would receive food supplements and
nutrition education. Upon recovery from malnutrition, beneficiaries would be phased out of the
food supplementation program based on health personnel evaluations. Appropriate breastfeeding
practices would be rewarded by delivering supplementary food. Malnourished infants under one

Country: Argentina                                           Matemal & Child Health & Nutrition 11
year of age would receive an iron-fortified milk formula. Iron and folic acid tablets would be
distributed to all pregnant women. Food supplementation, including micronutrients, would be
provided to beneficiaries at local health facilities according to a programmed schedule of health
checkups.
The mix of food products to be distributed under the food supplementation program is
based on a balanced contribution of nutrients, in line with the country's nutritional habits. It
would not affect breastfeeding duration negatively because the food products to be distributed in
the first six months post-partum would be delivered only to currently lactating women. In
addition, the composition and cost of the food packages was defined to take into account intra-
family redistribution of foodstuffs, and the financial sustainability of the targeted food
supplementation program.
The health and nutrition education and promotion program would provide
information, education, and communication about prenatal care, breastfeeding and infant feeding,
dietary quality, hygiene, family planning, sexually transmitted diseases, environmental health risks,
and violence and injury prevention. The objective of this program would be to improve health and
nutritional practices among the general population, particularly changing behaviors, and to
prevent the onset of illness and disease. To this end, the project would support in-service training
for health personnel so that they improve the quality of service delivery, disseminate health and
nutrition messages effectively, and the development of health and nutrition-related messages and
materials, including radio and television campaigns.
Organization and Delivery of Care. The basic package of maternal and child health and
nutrition services would be delivered through an improved network of existing health centers and
maternity wards of local hospitals. In those areas in which hospitals are handling over 10,000
deliveries per year (i.e., well above international standards), additional maternity wards would be
established to relieve congestion. The basic package of services would be offered in health centers
covering between 1,000 and 10,000 residents, and in hospitals assisting between 2,000 and 5,000
child deliveries per year.
The project would promote the establishment of a referral system based on local health
service arrangements within well-defined geographic areas. Health centers would become the
entry point to the local service delivery network by providing pre-natal care to pregnant women,
and would refer patients to hospitals with obstetrics and neonatal units for child delivery. After
delivery, mothers and children would be referred back to the health center, where they would
receive post-partum care and nutrition education and promotion, particularly for improving
breastfeeding and infant feeding practices, and periodic growth monitoring checkups and
vaccinations, respectively. Health personnel would also undertake outreach activities (e.g., home
visits would be conducted to detect those beneficiaries failing to meet their scheduled visits to
health centers and motivate them to do so).

Improvement of Health Services Network. In each province (or municipality) covered
by a subproject, the project would help rehabilitate and upgrade existing health facilities, improve
staff mix, and train existing and new staff. It would also strengthen programming, monitoring,
supervision, supply, and maintenance. Intersectoral linkages would be promoted, particularly with
preschool programs and community organizations.
The Early Childhood Development program would: (a) support the growth and
development of children below six years of age; (b) promote comprehensive care, and reorganize
existing programs; and (c) facilitate the incorporation of women into the labor market by
providing child care. Special attention will be given to domestic violence prevention and early
detection of high-risk families for treatment and adequate referral. Transforming pre-school
feeding programs ("comedores infantiles"), child care centers, and kindergartens into child
development centers (CDCs) will improve nutrition and psychosocial status. CDCs would have
two shifts of six hours each, with a capacity of an average of 100 children per shift. Child care
would be provided by mothers under the supervision of CDC staff.
For those CDCs where children below two years of age are already being assisted, project
activities will reinforce these ongoing programs by promoting the adequate psychosocial
development and nutrition of children. Organization, administration, and supervision will be
strengthened to ensure adequate nutrition of children. These activities will be supervised by a
nutritionist.
Training would be provided for staff in the management and implementation of social
programs and for teachers and mothers in charge of the centers in the substantive aspects of the
program, so that teachers develop early childhood education activities and mothers may take on
the functions of community educational promoters. Educational materials and toys would be
procured, and equipment would be provided for improving cooking, food distribution, and
educational services. The above activities would be financed by the project except meals, which
would continue to be financed under existing federal and provincial arrangements. Teachers
would be placed in preschool feeding centers where no educational activities are carried out at
present. Their salaries would be financed by provinces and municipalities.
The CDCs would operate in coordination with health centers. To enter a CDC, each child
must have a health card issued by the health center. Growth monitoring would be done each
semester by local health center staff. Malnourished and sick children detected at the CDCs would
be referred to health facilities where they would have admittance priority, and health and nutrition
education activities would be organized. Outreach activities would be carried out to strengthen
linkages with households and communities, particularly for the management and operation of the
CDCs. This will help make the program sustainable.
Institutional Strengthening would enhance the capacity of provinces and municipalities
to plan, manage, and implement mother and child-related activities. Technical assistance to be
provided under the project will help: (i) improve preparation of subprojects; (ii) strengthen the

management of UEPs and UEMs, so as to improve the implementation of subprojects; this would
result in increases in efficiency through better programming, management, and monitoring of
subprojects; (iii) help provinces and municipalities implement integrated models of health care
delivery; (iv) help provinces and municipalities set up and consolidate multisector teams (health,
education, and social action); (v) transfer the PROMIN methodology to other projects, especially
in the areas of targeting, intersectorial coordination, preparation, management, monitoring, and
evaluation of subprojects; and (vi) help improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the
implementation of the "Daci6n de Leche" program.
Component 2 - Strengthening of MOH's Statistical System  (US$4.8 million, 2.8%  of
project costs)
The MOH's statistical system provides epidemiological and hospital statistics which allow
the MOH to track the evolution of health problems on the demand side as well as the response
being provided through the production of services, principally at the hospital level. Information is
registered at the provincial level and then consolidated at the national level. The data are a key
input to the Ministry's MIS and are used in the management of the health system. They are also
used for long-term analysis of trends and comparisons.
During recent years, the statistical system has experienced a number of problems such as
variability in data quality, under-recording, delays, and poor quality of report presentation
(notably lack of graphics). This results from obsolescence in technology and deterioration of skills
of statistical personnel.
This component will help improve the statistical system through the financing of
improvement in system design, computer hardware and software, and training of personnel at the
provincial and central level.
Component 3 - Project Administration (US$5.3 million, 3.1% of project costs)
This component would help finance the administrative and operating costs of the PCU
over a five-year period (1997-2003). This includes: (i) financing of PCU consultants; (ii)
PROMIN II project preparation costs; (iii) travel; (iv) training; and (v) other administrative
expenses (materials, cleaning, etc.).

ANNEX 2 b
Subproject Cycle and Eligibility Criteria
Participating Agencies and Procedures
The PCU, which reports to the Vice-Minister of Health, would be responsible for project
coordination, including oversight of resource flows among executive agencies and beneficiaries as
well as for provision of the administrative linkage between federal agencies and provincial
governments participating in the project.
Subprojects would be formulated by Provincial Implementation Units (UEPs) and
Municipal Implementation Units (UEMs) using: (a) the eligibility criteria agreed with the Bank;
(b) the methodology designed for subproject preparation; and (c) the guidelines for subproject
presentation and evaluation.
The subproject cycle and eligibility criteria would be included in an Operational Manual,
satisfactory to the Bank. They are summarized below.
Subproject Cycle
Promotion. The PCU would invite the provinces and municipalities to identify subprojects
for financing under the project. Representatives from the PCU would visit provinces to transmit
and explain subproject eligibility criteria. Technical assistance would be provided to weaker
provinces for subproject preparation.
Preparation. Providers or groups of providers and local coordinating agencies would
present subproject ideas and proposals to the UEP which would prioritize and consolidate them.
Subproject documents would include notably a diagnosis of issues to be addressed, proposed
solutions, activities to be carried out, estimated cost, and arrangements to ensure sustainability.
Subproject preparation activities would be financed using funds provided by the provincial and
municipal governments, local communities, and NGOs, as well as technical assistance from the
PCU.
Evaluation. The PCU would analyze proposals using the eligibility criteria.
Approval. The PCU would: (i) approve subprojects; (ii) suggest changes; or (iii) reject
them if they do not conform to the eligibility criteria. Approved subprojects would be sent to the
Bank for its no-objection.
Signing of Subproject Agreement. An agreement would be signed by the provincial
Governor, the Mayor, and the National Minister of Health, delineating the obligations and rights
of the provinces, municipalities and the MOH in undertaking subprojects, assigning
responsibilities to the respective parties, and specifying criteria for sustainability of the subproject.



Project Appraisal Document                                                           Page 19
Country: Argentina                                                 Matenal & Child Health & Nutrition II
In the case of provincial subprojects, each province would sign a separate subproject agreement
with participating municipalities.
Implementation. For each subproject, contracting will be undertaken for civil works,
goods, and consultants using Bank procurement guidelines. The UEPs and UEMs would remit to
the PCU within five days of the end of each month a subproject statement of expenditures. This
would be analyzed by the PCU relative to the financial plan that the UEP and UEM have
presented at the beginning of subproject implementation.
Supervision and Follow-up would be undertaken by the provinces, municipalities, and
the PCU. This would take two different forms. First, the implementation of rehabilitation,
construction, and equipping of facilities would be followed to ensure compliance with timetables
and quality. Part of that supervision would be contracted out to private consultants. The second
aspect would be the follow-up of the transformation of the health service delivery model into an
integrated model. This would involve the follow-up of progress of in-service training and the
tracking of monitoring indicators that measure improvements in outputs (Annex 1).
Eligibility Criteria
Project Size. Subprojects should be at least municipal in scale, i.e., at a minimum they
would cover a network of health centers and CDCs that provide services to the target population
in the municipality. Coverage of investment subprojects should extend to no less than 10,000
people. Small municipalities can combine to meet the minimum coverage target.
Targeting. Subprojects should cover municipalities in which the poor represent at least 30
percent of the population in the targeted areas within the municipality.
Organization. A subproject should involve existing organizations, including provincial,
municipal, and non-governmental entities. The UEP should remain in place for the duration of the
subproject, and is responsible for all liaison with the PCU at the national level. This involves
intersectoral and interjurisdictional coordination of the project relative to carrying out its
objectives and establishing and conforming to project norms.
Sustainability. The province and municipality should have the fiscal and administrative
capability to carry out the subproject, as demonstrated in the analysis undertaken as part of
subproject preparation. The capacity of a province to implement a subproject would be based on
existing capacity in the following areas: (a) types of existing programs similar to the proposed
subproject; (b) capacity of local organizations to manage existing programs in the subproject area
(quality, number, and experience of management staff of local institutions); and (c) the province's
experience in implementing health, nutrition, and education programs. For the latter, special
attention will be given to: (a) availability of budgetary resources over the last five years; (b)
existing procedures for administration of human, material, and financial resources; and (c)

relationship between provincial Ministries of Health and Education and provincial Ministry of
Finance.
Political Commitment of the province and municipality to basic health care and nutrition,
and early childhood development as demonstrated through existing and planned resource
allocation, and ongoing and planned reforms.
Reform of Nutrition Programs. Agreement to reform "Dacion de Leche" program based
on project-financed technical assistance.
Basic Package. Agreement to implement PROMIN's basic health and nutrition and early
childhood development service packages.
Accounting and Audits. Establishment of separate subproject accounts, accounting, and
audit.
Counterpart Funds. Agreement to assign the required resources to the project, including
advance annual funding allocations and adequate cash releases to cover incremental recurrent
expenditures. Redeployment of staff or, when required, recruitment of incremental staff.
Performance Monitoring. Performance monitoring indicators (Annex 1) would be used
to monitor progress in subproject implementation and impact.

Discount Rate
A discount rate of 10 percent was used.
Assumptions
For the maternal and child health component, the analysis considers: (i) direct benefits
resulting from reduction in morbidity; and (ii) indirect benefits resulting from reductions in infant
and maternal mortality.
To estimate the direct benefits, the analysis assumes the following improvements in the
health of the children under six years of age: (a) a 40 percent reduction hospitalization due to
respiratory infections; (b) a 60 percent reduction in hospitalizations due to diarrhea; (c) a 40
percent reduction in malnutrition and other illness which lead to reductions in the demand for
hospital care; (d) a 40 percent reduction in hospitalization due to other avoidable causes; and (e) a
12 percent reduction in the demand for neonatal attention at the hospital level. These results are

Country: Argentina                                                  Maternal & Child Health & Nutrition 11
then paired with expert estimates of the potential reductions in morbidity in each category of
avoidable morbidity to determine the total bed days that could be averted due to the project
interventions. Total direct benefits are then estimated by multiplying the total potential bed-days
averted by estimates of the cost per bed-day for each of the six categories analyzed based on
preliminary cost estimates from several Argentine hospitals.
To estimate the indirect benefits, the analysis assumes the following improvements: (a) a
40 percent reduction in mortality due to respiratory infections; (b) a 35 percent reduction in
mortality due to diarrhea; (c) a 50 percent reduction in mortality and other illness which lead to
reductions in lifetime wages; and (d) a 50 percent reduction in mortality due to other avoidable
causes. The discounted life-years saved attributable to these reductions are then converted to
monetary terms by using estimates of the discounted life time earnings lost from each death4.
For the early childhood development component, the analysis assumes that the project
interventions on young children will improve their academic achievements and thus their income
during their working life between the ages of 16 and 65, using employment probability factors (of
about 0.52-0.58). It uses the data from household surveys to determine differences in the
academic achievement between families with unsatisfied basic needs (necesidades basicas
insatisfechas, or NBI) who, on average, have only 7 years of education, and others outside this
group who generally benefit from at least 10 years of education.
Cost-effectiveness
Although it was not possible to calculate the number of disability-adjusted life- years saved
(DALYs) from the project, it is estimated that between 80 and 90 percent of the project
interventions related to maternal and child health fall into the range of a cost per DALY saved of
US$30 to US$400. This is in line with the average Government spending from general revenues
for middle-income countries (World Development Report 1993: US$20-350).
Note: A detailed economic analysis, sensitivity analysis of risk, and an assessment of the long-
term sustainability of the project is available in the Project File.
4 The analysis estimates the lifetime earnings is estimated at $56,000. This is highly consistent with the Ley de
Riesgos de Trabajo No. 24.557, Art. 15 (Worker's compensation legislation) which establishes a value of
$55,000 as the base figure for indemnization in the case of work-related injuries and death.
