I. THE POWER AND ENERGY SECTOR
A. Energy Resources
Indigenous Resources
1.01      Jordan has no coal deposits nor any known reserves of oil or
natural gas. The only indigenous energy resources consist of oil shales,
a small hydropower potential, and geothermal and solar energy. There are
an estimated 10,000 million tons of oil shale rocks, particularly in the
area of Al-Lajjoun near El Hasa, with a potential oil content of 65-70
liters per ton. There is no commercially proven technology for the extrac-
tion of oil from these shales and there are also serious environmental and
financial obstacles to their development. However, a program of work aimed
at a full-scale feasibility study of their exploitation is under discussion
with German aid. The hydro potential is confined to about 2 MW at the King
Talal Dam on the River Zarqa and a possible 20 MW at the proposed Maqarin Dam
near the Syrian border. There are geothermal occurrences, particularly in the
north of the country, but no estimate of the potential exploitable geothermal
resources. The first phase of a UNDP study of two promising areas is under
way, to be followed by exploratory drilling and, if this is sufficiently pro-
mising, by a development program.  Solar energy is another potential resource,
in view of the favorable climatic conditions.  The Royal Scientific Society of
Jordan is carrying out some solar energy research, and an experimental solar
research station has been established at Aqaba. Three firms have started
production on a small scale of solar water heaters, for which there could be
a considerable internal market.
1.02      A search is under way for possible uranium deposits, including
a scintillometer survey (with the help of the International Atomic Energy
Agency) of all phosphate areas, and a radiometric survey to be carried out
as part of a geophysical survey with USAID financing. It is too early
to judge the prospects of exploitable discoveries.
Oil Imports
1.03      At present Jordan is entirely dependent on imported oil for its
commercial energy needs (non-commercial energy sources, such as firewood,
and animal and vegetable wastes are relatively insignificant). Under the
agreement with the Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company for the transit by pipe-
line across North Jordan of crude oil from Saudi Arabia to the Mediterranean,
Jordan is entitled to draw crude oil for its own requirements through two
connecting pipelines to a refinery at Zarqa. The refinery has a present
maximum capacity of 1.3 million tons annually, but expansion currently
under way will increase this to 3.75 million tons in 1979. The output of
the expanded refinery is expected to meet local requirements to beyond
1985.



-2-
Consumption Trends
1.04      The crude oil is processed at the refinery into petroleum products,
the great bulk of which are consumed internally, including fuel oil and gas
oil for electricity generation. Consumption has been expanding rapidly,
from 659,000 tons in 1973 to 1.135 million tons in 1977 (14.6% p.a.) and,
according to a Jordanian forecast, is projected to reach nearly 3 million
tons by 1985 (12.6% p.a.). About 100,000 - 150,000 tons p.a. of products,
mainly gasoline, kerosene and gas oil, are expected to be available for
export in the early 1980s.
1.05      Per capita consumption of commercial energy in Jordan reached 527
kilograms of standard coal equivalent 1/ (kgce) in 1976 (the latest year
for which comparable international data are available). This compares with
744 kgce for Syria, 456 kgce for Tunisia, 533 kgce for Lebanon and an average
for all developing countries of 426 kgce.
Organization
1.06      The two main organizations in the energy sector are the Jordan Oil
Refinery Company and the Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA). JEA's organiza-
tion and responsibilities are described below (para 1.12). The Jordan Oil
Refinery Company is a private company, subject to Government control over
policy and planning, which is responsible for importing crude oil and for
processing, distribution and marketing of petroleum products in Jordan.
1.07      Other institutions concerned with energy matters are the National
Planning Council (NPC), the National Resources Authority, the Royal Scientific
Society and the universities of Jordan and Yarmouk. The National Resources
Authority's activities include exploration for oil and gas, and for other
energy sources including nuclear materials. The Royal Scientific Society
carries out research on solar energy (para 1.01), and the universities also
do some energy research, notably on oil shales.
Energy Policy
1.08      The Government is aware of the importance of the energy sector
in the national economy and of the need for a sound development strategy
for the sector to meet future energy requirements. Following a review
of national energy problems in 1977, the Jordan National Energy Committee
(JNEC) was established to coordinate and direct national energy plans and
policies. Its membership includes representatives of all the institutions
concerned with energy matters referred to above, and the chairman is the
Minister of Industry and Commerce. JNEC has an important role to play in
the development of a national energy policy, including verification of the
appropriateness of the proposed power development program.
1.09      The proper management of imported energy, including internal pricing
policy, and active exploration for exploitable indigenous energy resources
deserve particular attention. The exploration already carried out (para 1.07)
1/   1 kg standard coal equivalent = 7,000 kilo calories.



-3-
has not produced enough information to assess the prospects of discovering
energy resources suitable for development, and their possible impact on future
sectoral strategy. However, a recent Bank paper 1/ put Jordan in the category
of countries with 'low' potential petroleum resources (i.e., less than 100
million barrels), although it suggested that there was scope for increased
exploration and additional geophysical surveys to verify this. With regard
to fuel pricing policy, JNEC is expected to address this issue as one of its
first priorities. The internal prices of petroleum products, which are con-
trolled by the Government, are not necessarily related to international
prices, although the price paid by Jordan for imported crude oil (about
$12.70/barrel at the time of appraisal) is based on the world market price.
In accordance with Government policy to keep down the cost of essential fuels
to domestic, commercial and industrial consumers, the prices of kerosene, gas
oil and residual fuel oil are heavily subsidized compared with international
levels, whereas the prices of gasoline and jet fuel are well above world
market prices. This policy was discussed during negotiations and the Borrower
confirmed that JNEC would complete proposals for energy sector development
strategy, including an energy conservation program and fuel pricing policies
by the end of 1979. As a part of the Bank's continuing dialogue with the
Government on energy sector development strategy and fuel pricing policy, the
Government would inform the Bank when JNEC has completed its work and would
discuss in due course JNEC's findings and proposals with the Bank.
B. The Power Subsector
General
1.10      The generation of electricity in Jordan was started by a number of
private and municipal organizations. Prior to the creation of JEA in 1967,
two investor-owned power companies, the Jordanian Electric Power Company
(JEPCO) and the Irbid District Electricity Company (IDECO), were responsible
for major power supply in the Northern region of Jordan. This region includes
the areas supplied by JEPCO, IDECO, the Jordan Valley Authority (JVA) and some
areas supplied directly by JEA. The Central region of Jordan has two main
load centers in the town of Karak and at the phosphate mine at El Hasa, each
supplied by its own power plant. The Southern region has one main load center
in Aqaba which is to be developed as a tourist center and as the only seaport
for Jordan. Power system integration, which has been almost completed in the
Northern region of Jordan, will further expand southwards to interconnect the
Central and Southern regions subsequently (see Map 13999). Several small towns
and villages in the Central and Southern regions have their own generating
sets, which operate a few hours a day to supply mostly lighting loads.

-4-
Organization
1.11      The Ministry of Industry and Commerce controls the power subsector.
The General Electricity Law, passed in 1976, defines the principles and basic
regulations for generation, transmission and distribution of power in Jordan
and also specifies the procedures for tariff approval, inspections, procure-
ment, granting of licences for power facilities, collection of statistical
data and preparation of technical information. Although the law deals
primarily with JEA's responsibilities, it also defines the basic rights and
obligations of JEPCO and IDECO concerning their public power supply activities.
The Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA)
1.12      JEA was established by Law No. 21 in 1967 to foster the coordinated
development of the country's power subsector. Its role was reinforced by the
General Electricity Law No. 8 (1976). According to this law, JEA is respon-
sible for power generation, transmission and distribution as well as the
regulation of the power consumption in the country. The law provides that JEA
should be independent both financially and administratively. JEA has a board
of eight directors appointed by the Government for a period of three years.
The Minister of Industry and Commerce is the Chairman of the Board and the
President of NPC the Vice-Chairman. The Director General of JEA is an ex-
officio member of the Board. The Board is responsible for formulating JEA's
general policy, securing internal and external loans with the Government's
approval, employing experts, advisors and agents, proposing JEA's yearly
budgets for the Government's approval, awarding contracts and proposing
regulations for the power subsector.
1.13      JEA is authorized under the General Electricity Law to grant
licences for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity
in the country, to supervise all power facilities and to issue instructions
and rules related to the generation, transmission, distribution, consumption
and sale of power in all areas of Jordan. JEA is also authorized to manu-
facture electrical and other equipment needed for its system. JEA has already
proved its competence in carrying out its responsibilities.
1.14      Distribution systems may continue to be owned by investors though
JEA may take these over by mutual agreement, subject to the Government's
approval. It is probable that JEA will take over IDECO (para 1.16) and some
other small municipal enterprises which cannot perform their power supply
role adequately and that it will ultimately assume responsibility for all power
supply in Jordan except in the Amman area, where JEPCO will remain responsible
for power distribution. JEA's organization has developed along sound lines
and is moving in the right direction. JEA's partial involvement in distribu-
tion activities, outside the Amman area, and its more active role in promoting
rural electrification schemes is justified. It would not be sensible to have
many small separate enterprises in charge of small towns and village electri-
fication, where Government's financial support is still required.  The present
set-up in the power subsector, with JEPCO continuing to exist alongside JEA,
is considered to be satisfactory for the foreseeable future. The Government
also support this judgement.



-5-
The Jordanian Electric Power Company (JEPCO)
1.15      JEPCO used to be the largest power generating and distributing
enterprise in Jordan. With the creation of JEA, JEPCO has ceased its activi-
ties in power generation. JEPCO's main generating plant at Marqa with 11
diesel units (about 40 MW) was transferred to JEA in 1976. Two other generating
plants, old and inefficient, were retired. JEPCO's distribution system fol-
lows the British pattern; power is distributed at 33, 6.6 and 0.4 kV. The
networks are mostly underground cable and substations are very modern, but in
spite of this, the quality of service is rather poor for lack of skilled labor
and material shortages. JEPCO and its consultants (Kennedy & Donkin, UK)
estimate that load demand in Amman is suppressed by about 5% due mainly to
inadequate coordination of planning to meet loads and low voltage levels. In
general, coordination of public services in Amman (electricity, telephones
water supply and sewerage, roads, etc.) is difficult. There are about 2,000
domestic and 60 larger customers at present waiting for power supply. JEPCO
accounted for about 85% of JEA electricity sales in 1978. JEPCO is, in
general, well organized and managed. Since JEPCO is the major power distri-
butor in Jordan, its sound future development is very important for the
effectiveness of the power subsector. JEPCO needs access to foreign bor-
rowings and Government support in improving the company's financial situation
(para 3.15).
The Irbid District Electricity Company (IDECO)
1.16      IDECO, the other major company, operates a diesel power plant (9 MW)
in Irbid and distributes power in the Irbid area, in part of the Jordan Valley
and in some rural areas. IDECO has major managerial and financial problems.
It is not properly staffed and organized. The company seems incapable of
carrying out its development programs, particularly the rural electrification
schemes which it is responsible for implementing. In order to resolve these
problems, the Government intends to ask JEA to take over in the near future
all IDECO's power supply activities, a course of action which IDECO's manage-
ment supports and which would be appropriate in the circumstances. Since
IDECO's share in the total power consumption is less than 10%, it is not
expected that its takeover by JEA would have a significantly adverse impact
on JEA's financial situation.
Historical Development
1.17      National power sector statistical data for the period 1971-1977
are shown in Annex 1.1. Total generation increased from 230.4 GWh in 1971 to
594.9 in 1977. The consumption of electricity rose from 204 GWh in 1971 to
512.8 GWh in 1977 (trend growth rate 17% p.a.). Electricity consumption in
1977 is summarized below by customer categories and administrative districts.

The Northern region of Jordan (Amman and Irbid Districts) accounts for 92%
of the total consumption. The Central and Southern regions are relatively
undeveloped and the Government is endeavoring to accelerate their development
by locating future major industrial projects there. The pattern of electri-
city consumption is reasonably well balanced. Industrial consumption has
increased in the last five years and now slightly exceeds domestic consump-
tion. By penalizing inefficient and excessive use of electricity (para 1.35)
the tariff policy has helped reduce peak demand. The total electricity losses
in generation and distribution are in the order of 15% of generation.
1.18      Basic statistical data for JEPCO (1963-1977) and IDECO (1968-1977)
are given in Annexes 1.2 and 1.3. The maximum demand of the Amman area (JEPCO
& JEA) reached 90 MW in 1977. Electricity consumption per capita amounted
to 247 kWh in 1977 compared to 162 kWh in 1974. Thus, by 1977 Jordan had
achieved about the same level of per capita consumption of electricity as
Egypt had in 1975 or Portugal in 1950. About 50% of the total population,
mostly in rural areas, still has no access to public electricity supply
(details in Annex 1.4). Rapid increase in rural electrification is expected
by the end of 1982 (para 1.27).
1.19      The power system has at present a large number of small diesel
generating sets, two steam and four combustion turbine units. Details of
generating capacities are given in Annex 1.5. The Hussein thermal power
plant at Zarqa has two 33-MW units in operation and two combustion turbines
(13 and 18 MW). The Marqa diesel-electric power plant after its recondition-
ing (Credit 570-JO) will have an available capacity of 40 MW. Two 18-MW
combustion turbines were installed near this plant in 1978. The old 4.2
MW (rated) Aqaba power plant, with actual output of only 3.6 MW, was taken
over by JEA in 1976. Two new mobile diesel units of 1.125 MW each were put
into operation during 1977 to meet the urgent power requirements in Aqaba.
The largest captive plant is that of the Jordan Phosphate Company at El Hasa
(22 MW) which supplies the company's needs. There are a number of small
diesel sets, which are used mainly for emergency standby power supplies.

1.20      The first stage of the national transmission network was completed
in 1977, comprising 37 km of double-circuit 132-kV transmission lines from the
Zarqa steam plant to load centers in the Amman area with three 132/33-kV sub-
stations at Zarqa, Marqa and Bayader. The second stage, nearing completion,
includes 60 km of transmission lines from the Zarqa steam plant to Irbid and 8
km from the Bayader substation to the Fuheis Cement Works together with sub-
stations at Irbid and Fuheis. The Syrian and Jordanian power systems were
connected in 1977 through a 66 kV transmission line between Damascus and Irbid
with a 10-MVA, 66/33-kV substation at Irbid. Operation and maintenance of
power plants and transmission network is satisfactory.
1.21      JEA has started implementing distribution and rural electrification
schemes in Aqaba, Karak and the Jordan valley. The distribution networks in
Aqaba and Karak were rehabilitated and extended in 1978. In the Jordan valley,
where the object is to provide power supply to towns, villages, water pumping
stations and population centers, work on the erection of a 33-kV network of
about 190 km and 52 (33/0.4 kV) substations feeding into 27 villages and 5
water pumping stations started during 1977.
Development Program
1.22      The national load forecast for the period 1978-1985 (Annex 1.6)
shows total system sales increasing from 520.6 GWh in 1978 to 2,370.5 GWh in
1985, with an annual growth rate of 24.2% p.a. The power system is expected
to be mostly interconnected in 1983. Details of the interconnected system are
given in Annex 1.7. The maximum demand would increase from 110 MW in 1978 to
488 MW in 1985. The available generation capacity is expected to grow from
161 MW in 1978 to 598 MW in 1985. Except in 1984, when the available capacity
margin appears low because no new large generating plant comes on stream
in that year, the capacity margin, taking into account interconnection with
Syria (para 1.26), looks reasonable for the rather small Jordanian system.
The forecast of sales by consumer categories in the period 1978-1985 is given
in Annex 1.8. Sales to JEPCO and IDECO would represent 82% of JEA's total
sales in 1979 and 62% in 1985. A rapid increase is expected in sales to large
industries, whose share in JEA's total sales will increase from 11% in 1979 to
24% in 1985. The national load forecast also implies that per capita consump-
tion would rise from the 1977 level of 247 kWh to some 932 kWh in 1985.
1.23      The most important industrial and mining developments are a potash
complex (estimated cost $430 million) of 1.2 million tons annual capacity at
Ghor Safi in Central Jordan; a phosphate fertilizer plant at Aqaba (costing
around $320 million); expansion of the Zarqa oil refinery; further development
of phosphate mining at El Hasa; and a new cement factory in Central Jordan
near Rashadiya. According to the five-year plan, industrial output is expected
to grow at 26% p.a. over the period to 1980 and output of the manufacturing
and mining sectors would amount to 28% of GDP by 1980, compared to 16% in
1975. Despite increased emphasis on social and regional objectives, there
would be continuing investment in industry and the rate of growth of indus-
trial output over the period 1980-1985 might be around 20% p.a. This would



- 8 -
be accompanied by rapid growth of industrial power consumption. The load
projection looks reasonable in relation to Jordan's present stage of develop-
ment and its general economic prospects. The previous JEA load forecasts
have been reasonably accurate. Some of the projected major new industrial
loads (Annex 1.8) may be delayed and there may also be deviations from the
forecasts for other customer categories. Therefore, for the sensitivity
analysis of the power sector development, JEA uses annual growth rates
+ 10% of the basic forecast, which are judged to cover the likely range of
possibilities.
1.24      JEA's Planning Department, in association with the consultants,
usually updates at least once a year the load forecast and medium-term invest-
ment program. The power system planning, though in general satisfactory,
needs to be further improved. JEA depends largely on consultants services
for its planning and should develop more its own planning capabilities.
JEA has agreed to take appropriate action by December 31, 1979 to strengthen
its Planning Department and after consultations with the Government, inform
the bank, for its review and comments, of actions proposed to be taken to
develop adequate power subsector planning capabilities within JEA.
Generation
1.25      The Hussein steam power plant at Zarqa is being extended by a third
33-MW unit originally scheduled for commissioning by the end of 1978. The
contract for the supply and erection of 3 x 66 MW units at this site, to be
put into operation in the years 1981 and 1982, has been awarded. New diesel
power plants are under construction at Aqaba and Karak. The first two units
of the Aqaba diesel power plant (2 x 3.48 MW) were put into operation in 1978
and the other three units (3 x 5 MW) are expected to be ordered in 1979 for
commissioning in 1981.  The Karak diesel power plant (3 x 1.5 MW) is expected
to be in commercial operation in 1979.  A new steam power plant would be
built in Aqaba with an initial installation of 3 x 120 MW reheat steam units
to be brought into service in 1985, 1986, and 1987.  This plant would burn
residual fuel oil and would be connected through the high voltage transmission
network with the Central and Northern regions of Jordan.  An additional gas
turbine unit with a capacity of 18 MW is expected to be brought into service
in 1984. A new diesel generating plant (4 x 1.5 MW) is to be installed in
Ma'an in 1980-81. For generation planning purposes, the interconnection with
Syria has been treated as a generating plant with an output of 50 MW.
Interconnection with Syria and Transmission Network
1.26      The Syrian and Jordanian power system will be interconnected via a
230-kV transmission line from Damascus to Irbid (20 km long within Jordanian
territory) with a 100-MVA transformer substation at Irbid. This interconnec-
tion, which is expected to be brought into operation in 1979, will provide
many benefits. The main benefits are improved economy by better utilization
of power system generating facilities through coordinated operation and main-
tenance, as well as improved reliability of supply by giving the Jordanian
power system access to the reserve generation capability of the Syrian system.



Reserve-sharing will allow JEA to reduce its generating capacity by 50 MW
which otherwise may be viewed as an idle investment. According to contract
arrangements with the Etablissement Public d'Electricite, Syria, JEA will
import up to 28 GWh annually. The new transmission network to be constructed
in the period 1979-82 is described in para 2.02. A 132-kV transmission line
from Rashadiya to Aqaba will be brought into service in 1983. This line will
complete the transmission link between the Northern and Southern regions,
which detailed consultants' studies have demonstrated is required to ensure an
economic and reliable power supply in Jordan.
Rural Electrification
1.27      JEA, assisted by its consultants, has prepared a national rural
electrification plan covering all villages with more than 500 inhabitants.
Financing arrangements for part of the plan have been made and site survey
works have already started. The plan is scheduled for completion in 1982.
When this plan is completed about 70% of the total population will have
access to public power supply. A loan agreement with USAID in the value
of US$9 million covering the supply of materials for the electrification
of 37 villages and suburban areas in Amman District was signed in September
1977. Another loan agreement with USSR for about 10 million rubles covering
the supply of materials and supervision of erection works for the electrifi-
cation of 100 villages in Irbid District and 37 villages in Amman District
was signed in October 1977. These projects will be implemented by JEPCO
and IDECO. Relending agreements for both loans have been signed between
JEA and JEPCO/IDECO.
1.28      A loan agreement was signed with the Government of Denmark for the
supply of 21 small mobile diesel generating units to be installed in 12 remote
villages and to reinforce existing diesel plants in some towns in the Southern
region of Jordan. Two of the larger units (500 kW each) will be installed in
the towns of Shaubak and Tafileh to provide power for these towns and seven
nearby villages. A loan agreement for three million pounds is expected to be
signed with the Ministry of Overseas Development, UK to cover the electrifica-
tion of 30 villages in the Northern parts of Irbid District. The total number
of villages to be electrified by the end of 1982 under the above loans is 223.
In addition, the electrification of 33 villages near Karak, Ghor Safi and
Qatrana is also envisaged under the proposed Project (para 2.08).
Development Program Costs
1.29      JEA's total investment in the period 1979-1985 is estimated to be
about 185 million JD (US$610 million) at late 1978 prices. Details of the
development program and its costs are given in Annex 1.9. The proposed
Project represents about 9% of the total investment costs. The investment
program is considered reasonable in relation to the forecast demand to be met.
While the power sector investment program is based on the expected demand and
consumption growth in an unconstrained situation, the financial implications
for Jordan so far as finding the needed capital is concerned have not been
studied in sufficient depth. JEA's investments have in the past been financed



- 10 -
primarily from the national budget and foreign borrowings. Although future
investments are much larger, it is assumed that needed funds would be secured
through Government contributions, JEA's internal cash generation and borrow-
ings. JEA's power development program represents about 15% of the total
public investment. In view of the Government's firm plans for development of
major industries (para 1.23) no significant changes are expected in the fore-
cast demand and consequently in the investment program costs.
Role of IDA/Bank
1.30      IDA has made two credits to the Government of Jordan for the devel-
opment of the power subsector. IDA Credit 386-JO (1973) for US$10.2 million
together with an equal amount from the Kuwait Fund was used to finance two
33-MW steam power units and one 13-MW combustion-turbine at the Hussein
thermal power plant at Zarqa near Amman. The power generating facilities
have been completed and are operating satisfactorily; however, a claim by
the electro-mechanical contractor is still under arbitration. IDA Credit
570-JO (1975) for US$5 million with co-financing from the Arab Fund loan in
the amount of US$13.4 million was used to finance the second power project
in Jordan, comprising the addition of a third 33-MW steam power unit at the
Hussein thermal power plant, reconditioning of the diesel-electric power
plant at Marqa and the Southern Jordan Power Development Study. The second
power project is progressing satisfactorily and its completion is expected by
mid-1979. Important achievements under these credits were the establishment
of an economical and reliable power supply service, the development of JEA as
an autonomous and financially viable entity responsible for the whole power
sector and the establishment of a tariff structure based on marginal costs
enabling JEA to earn a rate of return of a minimum 9% on assets. The Credits
were also instrumental in attracting investments in the power subsector by
both the Kuwait and Arab Funds. A joint project completion report covering
the First and Second Power Projects is expected to be submitted by JEA in
1979. The proposed loan would enable the Bank to continue the institution-
building efforts in furtherance of the established objectives for the sector
(para 2.01).
C. The Beneficiary
Organization and Management
1.31      JEA's present organization structure based on the recommendations of
the management consultants (Peat, Marwick and Mitchell) appointed under Credit
386-JO is shown in Annex 1.10 (WB19609). The Director General is responsible
for conducting the activities of the Authority in accordance with the deci-
sions of the Board of Directors. He is supported at the head office by the
Chief Engineer and a corporate staff comprising the managers of the Finance,



Supplies and Contracts, Internal Audit and Administration and Personnel depart-
ments. The Chief Engineer is responsible for generation, transmission and dis-
tribution, planning, and standards and regulations, as well as for the pole
plant. He also supervises the regional offices at Karak and Aqaba.
1.32      JEA's concrete pole spinning plant has been in operation since 1968/
69. After initial teething problems, the plant has settled down to steady
production of various types of poles; production has now reached about 2,500
poles per year. JEA has decided to build a new plant with an output of about
8,000 poles which would meet JEA and JEPCO's needs in the near future. The
cost of producing concrete poles is less than the cost of importing steel or
wood poles up to 15 m lengths. Bids for civil works and equipment have been
invited. The new plant would supply poles needed for the rural electrifica-
tion component of the project.
Manpower
1.33      In October 1978, JEA had 1,069 employees, including 96 engineers and
551 technicians (Annex 1.11), and also 295 unfilled vacancies. The vacancies
are almost all in the Hussein Thermal Plant, Transmission and Distribution,
and Diesel Departments. JEA's staff appear to be well qualified. Many senior
staff members have studied abroad. Although staff salaries are competitive
considering other employment opportunities in Jordan, there is a continuous
movement of staff to oil-rich Arab Gulf countries where salaries are much
higher. The Government is well aware of this problem and is taking remedial
actions, mainly through its education and training plans for skilled labor.
Training
1.34      JEA pays adequate attention to the training of its staff.  All
key personnel have been trained abroad, mostly in the UK. During 1977, 16
engineers were sent on training to foreign countries for periods of up to 6
months. The training covered maintenance and operation of power plants and
transmission networks including microwave and telecommunication systems.
Four technicians and five administrators were also trained abroad in 1977
for periods of one month to a year. JEA is implementing a general training
program drawn up by an expert of the North Eastern Electricity Board (NEEB)
of the UK. Foreign experts, usually financed by their governments, also
assist JEA in various fields of activities. JEA will need one man-year of
foreign expert services in transmission network operation and power line
carriers. Overseas training of JEA's staff has been satisfactory, as has
on-the-job training in connection with the construction of new power facili-
ties, during which the constructors are required to provide for training of
JEA's operation and maintenance staff.
Tariffs
1.35      A tariff study covering the main supply areas of Amman, Irbid and
Karak, financed by the UK and prepared by NEEB, under terms of reference accept-
able to the Association, was completed in 1976. The study took into account



- 12 -
marginal costs of generating, transmitting and distributing electricity and
recommended tariffs, including a fuel adjustment clause, to secure a 9% finan-
cial rate of return. Tariffs based on NEEB's recommendations were approved by
the Government effective March 1, 1977, which resulted in an average increase
of JEA's bulk supply tariffs of about 75% from an average of 7.4 fils per kWh
to 13 fils per KWh. JEA's tariffs for the bulk supply of electricity to JEPCO
and IDECO, engaged in distribution activity in the areas of Amman and Irbid
respectively (Annex 1.12), consist of a maxium demand charge, a kWh charge for
on-peak (day use) and off-peak (night use) consumption, a power factor penalty,
fuel adjustment clause, and a 1 fil per kWh charge for all electricity sold by
JEA to establish a fund for rural electrification. Retail electricity tariffs
for different categories of customers in Amman, Irbid and the Jordan valley
served by JEPCO, and IDECO were also raised effective March 1, 1977 commensu-
rate with the increases in the bulk supply tariffs of JEA; these are summarized
in Annex 1.13.
1.36      Credit 570-JO provided for a further review of electricity tariffs
after the revised tariffs had been in effect for about one year to determine
if any changes would be required to meet the financial requirements of JEA,
JEPCO and IDECO. Government and JEA agreed with the Association and the Arab
Fund that such a review would be completed by December 31, 1977, with any
tariff changes to be implemented by March 31, 1979. British Electricity
International who conducted the review concluded that the electricity tariffs
effective March 1, 1977 would meet the financial requirements of JEA for 1978
and 1979, that JEPCO's electricity tariffs were adequate for 1978 and would
require revision in 1979, and that IDECO's electricity tariffs are adequate
provided operating costs are controlled. JEA's electricity tariffs are ade-
quate through 1979 but increases would be required in 1980 and thereafter and
are discussed in para 3.11. Also, JEPCO has reported that the introduction of
maximum demand charges to large industrial consumers has met with serious con-
sumer resistance. Agreement was reached that the Government would cause JEA
to review tariffs by March 31, 1980 and inform the Bank by April 30, 1980, for
its review and comment, of any proposed changes in tariffs.
1.37      JEA serves as a regulatory body of Government regulating the elec-
tricity supply rates that may be set by the privately owned electric utilities
such as JEPCO. These utilities are permitted to set such electricity tariffs
as will cover reasonable operating expenses plus interest on debt and provide
for at least a 7% return on shares. JEPCO's sales amount to about 85% of the
total sales in Jordan (para 1.15) and consequently, the electricity tariffs
of JEPCO are very important to the power sector as a whole in view of their
impact on the generation of funds for financing the expansion of JEPCO's dis-
tribution system. JEPCO's electricity tariffs were increased about 50% effec-
tive March 1, 1977 to an average of about 23 fils from an average of 15.3 fils
per kWh.
1.38      The 1 fil per kWh (para 1.35) collected by JEA is intended to
finance rural electrification by JEA, JEPCO and other institutions concerned
with rural electrification such as the Municipal and Rural Development Bank.
However, no guidelines have been established for the allocation of this
revenue amongst these agencies. In order to ensure satisfactory allocation of



- 13 -
these collections amongst the agencies engaged in rural electrification,
Government agreed to cause JEA to establish by December 31, 1979 guidelines
for utilization of surcharges received by JEA in respect of rural electrifi-
cation and to inform the Bank of the details of such guidelines.
II. THE PROJECT
Objectives
2.01      The Project marks an important stage towards the long range sectoral
objective of progressively interconnecting the Northern, Central and Southern
regions of Jordan and creating an economic and reliable electric power system
serving the whole country.  The primary objective of the physical facilities
of the Project is to supply from the main public power system part of the
power needs of a potash complex (Bank Loan No. 1617-JO), phosphate mining
works, a cement plant and rural distribution loads in the Central region
of Jordan. Further objectives of the Project are the continuation of the
institution-building effort started with the establishment of JEA in 1967,
and the improvement of power sector planning.
Description
2.02      The Project covers part of the 4-year (1979-1982) Development
Program of JEA and consists of:
(a) about 225 km of 132-kV double-circuit transmission lines;
(b) five 132/33(11) kV-substations, with a total power transformer
capacity of 221 MVA, and extension of two existing substations;
(c) a system operations control center, with power line carrier
(PLC) and related communication equipment;
(d) electrification of 33 villages in the Central region of
Jordan;
(e) consulting services for Project engineering and construction;
and
(f)  a training program for JEA's engineering and accounting staff.
Transmission Lines
2.03      The transmission lines represent the extension of the existing 132-
kV transmission network around Amman. A double-circuit 132-kV transmission
line, about 72 km long, between Amman South and Qatrana will interconnect the
Northern and Central regions. A line between Qatrana and Ghor Safi, via
Karak, about 44 km long, will supply the Ghor Safi Potash Complex, increased



- 14 -
power requirements of Karak Town and nearby rural areas. In order to supply
the El Hasa Phosphate Works and Rashadiya cement plant as well as small towns
and rural loads, a transmission line Qatrana-El Hasa-Rashadiya, about 88 km
long, would be built. A double-circuit 132-kV line between Amman South and
Bayader, about 11 km long, which would close the ring encircling Amman City,
would significantly increase the security of power supply to Amman and the
loads in the Central region.
2.04      JEA has determined, with the help of consultants, the specific
system requirements to meet industrial, urban and rural loads in the Central
region of Jordan. The most suitable voltage level for the supply of the
Central and Southern regions is 132 kV, already used in the Northern region.
Important industrial customers would be supplied by 132-kV double-circuit
overhead transmission lines both for security of supply, and for economic
reasons. Calculations taking into account capital costs, operation and
maintenance, power losses and some technical aspects of the transmission
system indicate that 400 mm2 conductors are appropriate for all transmission
lines. The proposed transmission lines would provide adequate supply to
the industrial loads in the Central region and a substantial power transfer
capability in the long range development of the transmission network in
Jordan.
Substations
2.05      The Project comprises the construction of five transformer sub-
stations; Qatrana, Karak, Ghor Safi, El Hasa and Rashadiya, and extension
of existing Amman South and Bayader substations. At Qatrana substation,
local loads, irrigation and small rural loads would be fed through a 10-MVA,
132/33-kV transformer. The Karak substation equippped with 16-MVA, 132/33-kV
and 10-MVA, 33/11-kV transformers, would supply the Karak town consumers
and irrigation and rural loads in the area, including part of the Project
rural electrification scheme. The Ghor Safi 132/33-kV substation with two
40-MVA transformers would supply the potash complex and some rural loads.
The 132/33-kV substation at El Hasa with a 25-MVA transformer would supply
the phosphate works. The 132/33 kV Rashadiya substation with two 40-MVA
transformers would supply the cement works and local rural areas and serve as
a main interconnecting point for further extension of 132-kV lines to Ma'an
and Aqaba.  The extension of Amman South and Bayader substations is needed in
connection with the completion of the transmission ring around Amman City.
2.06      Substation site investigations were carried out to determine suit-
able locations and to obtain data for the selection of switchgear and other
equipment for the substations. Suitable sites of adequate size with easy
access and beyond cultivated areas have been found and reserved for all
substations. There are no problems in acquisition of the sites.



System Operations Control Center
2.07      In order that the operation staff can carry out the tasks of load
dispatching to meet the consumer's demand and perform necessary switching
manipulation in the transmission network under both normal and emergency
conditions, as well as to observe the system state and behavior, it would
be necessary to establish a System Control Center. The Center would be
connected by reliable communication links to power plants and 132 kV sub-
stations for the transfer of speech, data, some remote control and tele-
protection signals. This initial Control Center would be located in Amman
South substation presently under construction. The power line carrier (PLC)
equipment for the permanent links to the substations would be supplemented
by the mimic diagram relocated from the Hussein Power plant and extended to
include transmission facilities contained in the Project.  The communication
and control system would be centered at Amman South substation and JEA's
System Operations Department would be located there by 1981 to supervise
transmission and generation operations of the whole power system. JEA plans
to build the National Control Center after 1985 which would also be located at
Amman South substation. All communication links and basic equipment of the
initial System Control Center would be so designed and installed as to enable
their easy transfer to the National Control Center when built.
Rural Electrification
2.08      The rural electrification component of the Project includes a power
distribution network to electrify 33 villages with a total population of about
46,000 in the Central region (26 in the Karak area, 6 near Ghor Safi and 1 at
Qatrana) where the population has the lowest access to the electricity supply
in Jordan (Annex 1.4). After completion of the Project, access to public
electricity supply in the Central region would increase from the present 30%
to about 50%. The average cost per connected consumer would be in the order
of JD 290 (US$960), which is reasonable for Jordan. The proposed rural
electrification scheme would include 33-kV lines, substations and low voltage
distribution. Prestressed concrete poles produced by the JEA pole-spinning
plant would be used for overhead distribution lines. The rural electrification
component of the Project would comprise about 250 km of distribution lines and
3.2 MVA substation capacity. JEA's distribution department, which is well
organized and equipped, would operate and maintain the rural electrification
facilities.
Status of Engineering
2.09      JEA has engaged the services of Preece, Cardew & Rider (PCR),
England to prepare the feasibility study of the Project. The Report on the
Electrical Power Supply Developments of Jordan, Part 1-Developments up to
1982, gives the scope of the Project and shows its economic viability. JEA
and NPC have reviewed the report and approved its recommendations concerning
the proposed Project.
2.10      Detailed engineering of the Project components was practically
completed in 1978. The consultants have investigated in detail all line



- 16 -
routes and substations sites and prepared the draft bidding documents for
transmission lines, substations and power transformers to be financed by
the proposed loan. The consultants will assist JEA in the supervision of
construction and in procurement, manufacturing control, erection and inspec-
tion of permanent equipment. The assistance would also include making recom-
mendations in solving technical matters, in establishing operating rules
for the transmission network and system control center. JEA has agreed to
continue to employ consultants, whose qualifications, experience and terms and
conditions of employment shall be satisfactory to the Bank, for engineering
services, procurement and supervision of the Project.
Training Program
2.11      The Project includes training abroad of staff from JEA's Transmis-
sion and Distribution Department, which is directly responsible for the
Project implementation, and from the Accounting Department. JEA plans about
40 man-months for training for Project construction and operation and for
accounting training. This training is needed for efficient Project imple-
mentation and for further improvements in JEA's accounting services. The
general training program (para 1.34), which does not deal with JEA's problem
in retaining trained staff, needs to be reviewed and updated to cover JEA's
longer-term staff training needs in the light of its rapidly growing system.
JEA has agreed to submit to the Bank by December 31, 1979 a detailed staff
training program and implementation schedule covering all training needs and
proposed measures for the long-term retention of trained staff.
Project Cost Estimate
2.12      The estimated cost of the Project, excluding interest during con-
struction, is US$53.5 million equivalent, of which US$31.6 million would be
in foreign exchange, based on the exchange rate at the time of appraisal of
JD 1 = US$3.3. Annex 2.1 shows the estimated costs of the Project, which are
summarized as follows:
Local   Foreign   Total        Local   Foreign   Total

2.13      Project cost estimates were developed by PCR.  The estimates for
civil works are based on the cost of works of a similar nature that have
been completed recently or undertaken in Jordan; estimates for equipment and
materials are based on late 1978 international prices. JEA is exempt from
customs duties.  Physical contingencies have been estimated at about 12% for
civil works and about 8% for equipment and materials. These contingencies
are considered appropriate.  Price contingencies have been calculated at the
following annual rates corresponding to expected conditions in Jordan:
1979     1980      1981-82
Civil Works (local costs), %        12        10         10
Equipment and Materials
(foreign costs), %                 8         7         6
About 100 man-months of consulting services are required at an estimated cost
of US$8,500 per man-month, including all expenses (travel, computer use, etc.).
Project Financing Plan
2.14      The Project cost, excluding interest during construction, would be
financed as follows:
----- US$ Million -----
Local   Foreign   Total
(a) Government and JEA
Government equity contribution
and JEA's own resources             17.3       7.7      25.0
(b)  Customer Contributions
(i)  Arab Potash Company             2.0       3.0        5.0
(ii)  Phosphate Works                 1.0       3.0       4.0
(iii)  Rashadiya Cement                1.6       2.4        4.0
(c) Borrowings
(i)  Balance of Arab Fund Loan        -        0.5        0.5
(ii)  Proposed Bank Loan               -       15.0      15.0
TOTAL                         21.9     31.6       53.5
2.15      Agreements have been signed between JEA and each of the three large
consumer concerning their respective contributions. The large industrial
consumers would provide US$13 million equivalent and all the foreign exchange
transactions related to these contributions would be handled by the Central
Bank of Jordan. The balance of the Arab Fund loan from the previous stage of
the 132-kV transmission network is already available and the Fund has agreed
that it can be used for the extension of Bayader substation which is the part
of the Project.



- 18 -
2.16      The Government would make available for the Project to JEA the
US$7.7 million equivalent in foreign exchange and all other funds required
for carrying out the Project. The Government's equity contribution and JEA's
own resources to be used for the Project financing would amount to US$25
million. These financing arrangements are satisfactory. During negotiations,
the Government and JEA specified details of a procedure which would enable use
of the foreign exchange component of the consumer contributions (para 2.15) in
compliance with the proposed procurement, through international competitive
bidding, for works and goods of the Project.
2.17      The proposed Bank loan of US$15 million would be made to the Govern-
ment on standard Bank terms applicable to Jordan - 17 years, including 4
years' grace period. The Government would onlend the proceeds of the loan to
JEA on the same terms as those of the Bank loan to the Government. The
Government and JEA agreed during negotiations to provide all funds needed for
the prompt execution of the Project in accordance with the implementation
schedule and to guarantee coverage of any cost overruns that may arise in
carrying out the Project. The effectiveness of the Bank loan would be condi-
tional on a subsidiary Loan Agreement being duly executed by the Government
and JEA, in a form acceptable to the Bank, and providing for assumption of the
foreign exchange risk by JEA.
Implementation
2.18      JEA would be responsible for implementing the Project and would
use consultant services (PCR) to handle the engineering, supervision, quality
control and testing of equipment. JEA has substantial experience in carrying
out transmission and rural electrification projects. JEA's Transmission and
Distribution Department, with a staff of over 150, including 22 graduate
engineers and 68 technicians, will be directly responsible for the coordina-
tion and implementation of the Project. Details of the Department, its
organization structure and staffing are given in Annex 2.2 (WB19608).
2.19      The Project will be implemented during the four-year period 1979-82
according to the implementation schedule given in Annex 2.3 (WB19708). Be-
cause the Government and JEA consider the Project to be of top priority, the
implementation schedule is realistic. No problems are expected in acquiring
rights-of-way and sites for construction of transmission lines and substations.
Foreign contractors to be selected through international competitive bidding
are expected to carry out the construction of all the Project facilities (para
2.20). In view of the lack of local construction capabilities and the tight
implementation schedule, this procedure is appropriate.
Procurement
2.20      Procurement for goods and works to be financed by the proposed Bank
loan (other than consulting services and training) would be through interna-
tional competitive bidding under the Bank Group Guidelines for Procurement.



- 19 -
Bidding documents for 132-kV transmission lines, substations and power trans-
formers, prepared by JEA's consultants, were reviewed by the Bank staff and
found in accordance with these Guidelines. Contracts for transmission lines,
substations, power transformers, operations control center and rural electrifi-
cation would be executed on a "supply-and-erect" basis, which is reasonable in
the case of Jordan. These bidding arrangements would ensure effective inter-
national competition for the supply of all goods and works required for Proj-
ect execution. Although little local participation is expected in contracts
which may be financed from the Bank loan, a preference of 15% or actual import
duties, whichever is lesser, would be granted to Jordanian manufacturers who
participate.
Disbursements
2.21      The proposed loan would be disbursed against 25% of the total
expenditures of transmission lines and substations, including power trans-
formers and operations control center, 50% of the total expenditures of rural
electrification and 100% of foreign expenditures of consulting services and
training. The expected disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 2.4. The
closing date would be June 30, 1983 to allow for the payment of retention
money.
2.22      No advance contracting, except for consulting services (para
2.10), is expected. Retroactive financing is proposed for foreign expendi-
tures required for consulting services incurred after January 1, 1979 but
before loan signing. Total retroactive financing is not expected to exceed
US$200,000.
Environmental Aspects
2.23      The Project has no adverse effects on the environment.  The trans-
mission lines will cross desert and mountainous areas with few permanent
inhabitants and little agricultural activity. It is expected that fair
agreements on indemnification will be reached with all property owners
affected, under the land expropriation law, so as to assure them the same
economic situation they had prior to their dispossession. JEA is paying
appropriate attention to the aesthetic appearance of transmission and distri-
bution facilities and their compatibility with the environment. Possible
adverse visual impact will be reduced to a minimum by the use of selected
types of transmission line poles, including an aesthetic tubular steel pole
design near Amman City, and by suitable routing of overhead lines. The social
environment will be bettered by bringing public lighting to areas which have
not yet had power supply.

III. FINANCE
Introduction
3.01      Until 1975 the activities of JEA were primarily the operation of a
concrete pole plant and the supervision of projects of JEPCO and IDECO which
were financed by UK loans relent to them through JEA. By the end of 1977
JEA had assumed the role of the major electricity generating and transmitting
company in Jordan with net fixed assets of about US$80 million. JEA's elec-
tricity sales increased from 45 GWh in 1975 to 410 GWh in 1977 and revenues
from the sale of electricity from JD 348,000 in 1975 to JD 4,949,000 in 1977.
Past Performance and Present Position
3.02      JEA's actual income statements and balance sheets for the years 1974
through 1977 are presented in Annexes 3.1 and 3.2. Credit 570-JO requires JEA
to earn an annual rate of return of at least 9% on revalued assets. With this
in view JEA's tariffs were raised about 75% effective March 1, 1977 enabling
JEA to earn a return of about 7.6% for 1977. For 1978 the return is estimated
to be about 10.4%. Since JEA's assets other than the Marqa plant, are newly
installed and the Marqa plant was valued at current costs on its transfer from
JEPCO to JEA, the return for 1978 would fulfill the covenant. JEA's net fixed
assets in service as of December 31, 1977 amounted to about JD 16.7 million
(US$55 million) and its long-term debts were JD 15 million (US$50 million).
Its financial condition at the end of 1977 was satisfactory. Under Credit
570-JO, JEA would not incur any debt without prior approval of the Associa-
tion, unless its net revenues were 1.5 times the maximum debt service require-
ment in any succeeding fiscal year. JEA's debt service ratio for 1977,
adjusted for the tariff increase of March 1977, was 1.5. JEA's return for
1979 is estimated to be about 14.2% on unrevalued assets which is acceptable
considering that the assets were adequately valued as of 1978. JEA maintains
the prices of concrete poles to meet all operating costs of the plant, includ-
ing depreciation, and to provide a small profit. Because JEA will itself be
using most of the pole plant's production in the near future the pole pricing
policies are acceptable.
Accounting
3.03      The consultants (Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co.) appointed under
Credit 386-JO recommended a suitable accounting system for JEA similar to the
uniform system of accounts used in the U.S. General Electricity Law No. 8 of
1976 also requires that JEA adopt the rules and principles of modern account-
ing. JEA began implementing the recommended accounting system in 1977 but
progress has been slow due to the lack of experience of JEA's accountants in
utility accounting. In order to improve implementation, JEA, through an
agreement with the Ministry of Overseas Development, UK engaged the services
of an expatriate accountant in August 1978. With this assistance, and through
its plans for training accountants (see para 2.11), JEA would complete by
December 31, 1979 the implementation of the accounting system pursuant to the
study carried out under the First Power Project, in a manner satisfactory to
the Bank.



- 21 -
Billing
3.04      With the present limited number of consumers (2,200) JEA's billing
work has been proceeding smoothly and has not presented any serious problems.
With the growth of rural electrification, however, billing work will become
increasingly difficult to organize and manage in view of the consumers being
dispersed over a large area. JEA has allowed for this in its planning and
proposes to establish small offices in the centers of activity which will
include the billing operation for the electricity consumers in each area.
The final accounting work will be handled in JEA's main office as part of the
preparation of JEA's monthly accounts. After about 1980 the billing operations
would be handled by a mini-computer which is now proposed for 1979 to handle
JEA's inventories and payroll.
Accounts Receivable
3.05      Under the settlement for the transfer of the Marqa plant assets from
JEPCO to JEA at the agreed value of about JD 5.25 million, about JD 3.25 mil-
lion was to be paid to JEPCO by the Government as equity contributions to JEA
and the remaining JD 2.0 million was to be deducted from JEA's monthly bills
to JEPCO for electricity at 0.15 million every month. The Government did not
pay the sum of JD 3.25 million until 1978, and other Government accounts are
also past due to JEPCO. The non-payment caused cash flow problems for both
JEA and JEPCO, but these problems are expected to be relieved by the Govern-
ment's settlement of arrears from the sale of Marqa assets and the Govern-
ment's agreement to require the Amman Water & Sewerage Authority and Water
Supply Corporation to settle past due accounts to JEPCO by June 30, 1979.
JEA's accounts receivable for electricity supply reflect an average of about
40 days billings, which is acceptable. As regards the legal remedy for JEA
against defaulting customers, the existing law adequately safeguards JEA's
interests because Section 33 of the General Electricity Law specifies that
JEA, after a warning, may discontinue the supply of energy to any consumer who
fails to pay any sum due to the Authority. Section 34 further provides that
the Board may revoke the license of a distribution entity if its proprietor
commits a breach of its conditions or the provisions of the Law or of the
regulations issued thereunder after the warnings.
Auditing
3.06       The accounts of JEA are audited annually by auditors appointed by
the Board in accordance with Section 27 of the General Electricity Law.
Shair & Co., a local auditing firm with U.K. chartered accountants, has been
appointed by the Board for this purpose. Credit 570-JO requires that audited
financial statements be submitted to the Association not later than four
months after the end of the fiscal year. However, the audit for 1977 was
delayed about two months and was also not sufficiently detailed, pointing to
the need for additional time for the submission of JEA's audited financial
statements to the Bank, for say, two years until JEA is able to streamline
accounting procedures and set up in consultation with the auditors a realistic
time schedule for the audit. JEA therefore agreed to repeat the existing



- 22 -
covenant with the modification that the audited financial statements for the
years 1979 and 1980 be furnished to the Bank as soon as available, but in any
case not later than six months after the end of the fiscal year.
JEA's Financing Plan and Funds Statement
3.07      The investments in JEA's electricity assets as of December 31, 1977
increased from JD 40,000 in 1974 to JD 18,395,000. The construction program
for 1978 through 1985 (including interest during construction) is estimated at
about JD 195 million. JEA's sources and applications of fund statements for
1978-1985 are shown in Annex 3.3. JEA's construction program and financing
plan for 1978 through 1985 assuming tariff increases in 1980, 1983, 1984 and
1985 (see para 3.11) are summarized as follows:

_ Zi _
3.08      The total construction costs for 1978-1985, including interest
charged to construction and after allowing for inflationary price increases,
are estimated at US$621 million. JEA's investments in the additional nole
plant and other assets are estimated at US$22 million, investments in JEPCO
and IDECO are estimated at US$17 million, and additional working capital
including cash is estimated at US$25 million, making a total of US$685
million. Total internal sources, including customer contributions of US$12
million, are estimated to provide US$278 million amounting to 41% of the
total construction requirements and Government equity contributions of US$59
million provide about 9 percent of the total requirements. About 50% of the
program requirements are expected to be financed by long term borrowings of
US$348 million. Draw-down of existing long term loans will provide about
US$177 million and an additional US$171 million (including the proposed Bank
Loan) will have to be secured. Several possible lenders, including suppliers,
have expressed an interest in financing the program with loans or suppliers'
credits. The proposed financing plan in view of JEA's projected debt ratio,
debt service coverage, internal cash generation, and rate of return (para
3.11) is realistic and acceptable.
Financial Forecasts
3.09      JEA's financial forecasts for the years 1978-1985 are included in
Annexes 3.1 to 3.3, the assumptions used for the forecasts are shown in Annex
3.9. The forecasts reflect the start-up and expansion of JEA as a major bulk
supply electricity organization. The generation of electricity is estimated
to increase an average of 24.9% annually from 1978-1985. The statements
include appropriate adjustments for escalation of operating expenses and con-
struction program costs, with annual revaluation of assets for 1980 through
1985. The fuel costs reflect prices in effect as of December 1978. No
further fuel price increases are included in the forecasts because the fuel
adjustment clause included in the tariff structure provides for the automatic
recovery of any additional fuel costs that may arise from government's fuel
pricing policies.
Revaluation of Assets
3.10      Credit 570-JO requires that JEA's assets be revalued from time to
time in accordance with sound and consistently maintained methods acceptable
to the Association. JEA's assets in service as of December 31, 1977, with
the exception of Marqa plant, were installed beginning in 1976. Marqa plant
which was transferred to JEA at current costs is in the process of being
rehabilitated. Therefore, as of 1978, most of JEA's assets are newly instal-
led and the book value of the assets is considered to fairly reflect the
present values of these assets in 1979. However, beginning in 1980, but
in any event not later than December 31, 1981, the assets of JEA would be
revalued to reflect the effects of inflation on the value of assets in
service. The consultants (PCR) have recommended using an index reflecting
price inflation of capital goods for revaluing JEA's asssets. However, in
view of the difficulty of having a single index which reflects the costs of



- 24 -
imported equipment as well as local construction costs, it might be appro-
priate to use two different indices for revaluing foreign and local expendi-
tures. Accordingly for revaluing foreign expenditures, an index of the
prices of machinery and equipment exported by developed countries such as the
one published by the United Nations could be used, and for revaluing local
expenditures, the Gross Domestic Product Deflator, which would roughly reflect
changes in the value of the Jordan Dinar, could be used. For illustration and
planning purposes the assets shown in the financial forecasts in Annex 3.2,
have been revalued from 1981 through 1985 assuming an average annual price
increase of 7%. Agreement was reached with JEA to repeat the rate of return
covenant under Section 4.03 of Credit 570-JO and on the principles and proce-
dures for revaluation including the frequency of revaluation, namely that JEA
would revalue assets as of the end of the year in which the indices increase
by 15% over the level at which the assets were last valued.
3.11      Tariffs for electricity will need to be raised an average of about
13.5 percent effective January 1, 1980, for JEA to achieve the 9 percent rate
of return (para 3.10) on revalued assets. Further tariff increases of about
5 percent in 1983, 7.5 percent in 1984, and 7.5 percent in 1985 are estimated
to be necessary to meet the 9 percent rate of return requirement. The pro-
jected tariff levels are estimated to provide, after debt service require-
ments, about 37 percent of JEA's capital requirements through 1985 which is
satisfactory.
JEA's Debt Service Coverage
3.12      JEA's debt service coverage for 1978 in relation to the debt service
for 1979 was only 1.3 and yet JEA increased long-term debts in 1978 without
obtaining the Bank's approval as required under the Project Agreement for
Credit 570-JO. The significance of this covenant has been stressed to JEA and
Government and no future problems in this respect are anticipated. The debt
service covenant would be repeated in the proposed loan. JEA's debt service
coverage in 1979 on an annual basis is projected to improve to 1.6 and that
for 1980-1985, based on expected tariff increases, is projected to average
about 2.0, which is satisfactory. JEA's debt/equity ratio averages about
46/54 during 1978-1985 reflecting a satisfactory debt-equity relationship.
Insurance
3.13      Insurance coverage is provided through private local insurance com-
panies operating under government regulations to cover the usual risks; in
addition, the Government guarantees legitimate claims against these companies.
JEA's purchases from abroad are covered by insurance provided by the supplier.
The insurance coverage is acceptable. However, as a measure of risk manage-
ment, agreement was reached with JEA to have each year an annual inspection
by qualified inspectors of boiler and generating equipment to comply with
sound public utility practices.

JEPCO's Financial Statements
3.14      JEPCO's income statements for 1974 through 1977 (actuals) and for
1978 through 1983 (estimates) are presented in Annex 3.4.  JEPCO's net operat-
ing income declined from 1974 through 1976 but improved significantly with the
tariff increase of March 11, 1977. However, inflation considerably reduced
JEPCO's 1978 net income. At current tariffs JEPCO is expected to earn about
9% rate of return in 1979. It awaits the Government's decision on a request
for an 8% tariff increase to provide for an acceptable dividend on shares.
JEPCO's balance sheets for 1974 through 1977 (actuals) and for 1978 through
1983 (estimates) are presented in Annex 3.5. The net electric plant assets of
JEPCO amounted to about US$36 million at the end of 1977 after the sale of
Marqa assets.  JEPCO'S debt-equity ratio for 1977 of 30:70 was satisfactory.
The operating working capital of JEPCO was reduced in 1977 by the Government
not paying in cash the agreed amount for the Marqa assets transferred to
JEA (para 3.05); the settlement of arrears, including payment for the Marqa
assets and settlement of the past due accounts (para 3.05) is expected to
relieve the operating working capital problem for the near future. This issue
would also be considered by JEPCO in their ongoing tariff review, and is
expected to be taken into account in the Government's review of sector fi-
nances (para 3.15).
3.15      JEA and JEPCO are inter-dependent since about 85% of JEA's sales are
to JEPCO. Therefore, JEA's expansion plans have to be considered in relation
to those of JEPCO. So far as financing is concerned, JEPCO has in the past
depended on its own internal cash generation, the proceeds of sales of shares
and loans onlent by JEA. However, JEPCO would need significant financing from
outside lending institutions for its future expansion program. JEPCO's con-
struction program for 1978-1983, prepared by Kennedy & Donkin, is estimated to
cost about US$138 million; sources of financing for the program are estimated
as follows:
Sources                              US$ Millions
JEPCO's internal cash generation                     87
Sales of JEPCO shares                                27
Long-term borrowing                                  24
Total Sources        138
About US$7 million of the US$24 million of long-term borrowing is proposed to
be obtained from the relending of loans to Government through JEA, and the
balance of US$17 million is unidentified. The Government agreed to review
the investment requirements for the construction programs of entities engaged
in generation, transmission and distribution in the power sector for the years
1980 to 1984 and would inform the Bank by June 30, 1980 of any measures
required to facilitate the efforts of such entities in securing the necessary
financing from internal and external sources.



- 26 -
3.16      JEPCO's future debt-equity ratio is expected to average about 30:70
for 1978 through 1983 with the proposed financing plan. JEPCO's cash genera-
tion is expected to be not less than 1.5 times the annual debt service require-
ments. JEPCO's projected sources and applications of funds statements for
1978 through 1983 are presented in Annex 3.6.
IV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. The Power Market
Past Trends
4.01      The Project forms part of JEA's 1979-82 development program to meet
electricity requirements in the Northern and Central regions of Jordan. The
Northern region covers the area from the Syrian border in the north to Wadi
Mujib in the south; the Central region extends southwards from Wadi Mujib to
Shaubak (see Map). Since the two regions are not interconnected at present,
they are considered separately below.
4.02      The Northern region, forming a largely integrated power system
supplied by two major power plants (Hussein and Marqa), covers the service
areas of JEPCO, IDECO and JVA, together with individual loads supplied
directly by JEA. JEPCO and IDECO currently account for the great bulk (98%)
of electricity consumption in the region. As shown in Annex 1.2, maximum
demand in the JEPCO system rose from 22.9 MW in 1968 to 79 MW in 1977 (14.8%
p.a.) and sales from 88.2 GWh to 329.6 GWh (15.8% p.a.). The comparable
figures for IDECO (Annex 1.3) were 2.6 MW rising to 14.5 MW (21% p.a.) and
5.9 GWh rising to 44.6 GWh (25.2% p.a.). Growth rates have been markedly
higher in recent years than in the earlier part of the period, reflecting
the improved performance of the economy. Even so, the current figures are
believed to be an underestimate because of the existence of suppressed demand
estimated at about 5% (para 1.15). Direct JEA sales are relatively insignif-
icant at present, but this situation is expected to change in the future
(para 4.05).
4.03       In the Central region, the main load centers at present are Karak,
served by a local diesel plant recently taken over by JEA, and the phosphate
mine operated at El Hasa by the Jordan Phosphate Company, which has its own
diesel plant. Data available for the last few years show rapidly rising con-
sumption at both these centers. At Karak the growth rate has been over 30%
p.a., though from a relatively low level (0.53 MW and 1.7 GWh in 1974 to 1.2
MW and 3.8 GWh in 1977), while at El Hasa over the same period demand rose
from 2.2 MW to 3.7 MW and energy consumption from 10.3 GWh to 20.9 GWh.
Load Forecast
4.04      Although the period covered by the development program, of which
the Project forms part, extends only through 1982, JEA's consultants made a



forecast covering the period 1981-1995, since in power system planning it is
important to ensure that proposed short- and medium-term expansion programs
are consistent with optimum long-term system development. Separate forecasts
were made for the Northern and Central regions considered independently of
each other, without interconnection, and then a combined forecast was made,
assuming interconnection between the two regions. The details are given in
Annex 4.1 and the main features are described below.
4.05      Northern Region.  The projected demand in the Northern region is
made up of general growth in the Amman and Irbid areas, together with the
connection of major new loads to be supplied by JEA direct. The forecast
JEA sales to JEPCO imply a continuation in the first few years of the recent
growth rates of over 20% p.a., with a decline thereafter to 10% p.a. in 1986-
1990 and 7% in 1991-95. The projected JEA sales to IDECO show a continuation
in the early years of the recent high growth rates (Annex 1.3), reflecting
the connection of a major new load (the Ajlun radio transmitter) and the
first stage of the Irbid district rural electrification program (para 1.28)
but the rate of growth declines to 10% p.a. in 1981-85 and then gradually
decreases to 7.3% p.a. in 1991-95. The mission was able to verify that the
size and timing of the loads to be supplied by JEA direct (Annex 4.1) were
realistic in relation to the current status of the projects concerned.
4.06      The resulting forecast for the Northern region is summarized below:
1981         1985         1990         1995
Total JEA Sales, GWh                1,091        1,836        2,833        3,909
Required Generation, GWh            1,164        1,959        3,023        4,171
Average Growth Rate, % p.a.                13.9          9.1           6.6
4.07      Central Region.  The forecast for the Central region covers the main
load centers of Karak, Ghor Safi, El Hasa and Rashadiya, together with smaller
load centers in the region. Of the main centers, only Karak and the El Hasa
phosphate mines are in operation. Construction of the Ghor Safi potash com-
plex and of the Rashadiya cement works is scheduled to start in 1979. The
El Hasa phosphate mine is expected to start taking supplies from JEA in 1981
for a new dragline excavator. The rapid growth in Karak up to 1981 (see Annex
1.8) reflects the implementation of Stage I of the rural electrification pro-
gram (para 1.21) and the elimination of some existing suppressed demand with
the completion of the new Karak diesel plant (para 1.25). After 1981 the
Karak forecast shows a marked slackening of the growth rate, which settles
down at about 7% p.a. in the period 1986-95.
4.08      The resulting forecast for the Central region, assuming interconnec-
tion of the main load centers from 1981, may be summarized as follows:
1981        1985         1990         1995
Total JEA Sales, GWh                  116          388         510           612
Required Generation, GWh              124          414         544           653
Average Growth Rate, % p.a.                35.2          5.6          3.7



- 28 -
4.09      Northern/Central Regions Interconnected.  A separate forecast was
made assuming interconnection of the Northern and Central regions in 1981,
with supply from the Northern interconnected system to Ghor Safi, El Hasa and
Karak in 1981 and to Rashadiya in 1982. The combined forecast is given in
Annex 4.1 and summarized below:
1981         1985         1990         1995
Total JEA Sales, GWh                1,207        2,224        3,343        4,521
Required Generation, GWh            1,293        2,458        3,694        4,996
Average Growth Rate, % p.a.                17.4          8.5          6.2
The combined forecast of required generation assumes that total network
losses will be greater as a result of interconnection because of the longer
distances over which power has to be transmitted compared with the separate
regional systems based on independent generation.
4.10       The resulting projection was adopted by the consultants as the
"probable" forecast. For sensitivity testing, a "low" forecast was also
made, as shown in Annex 4.2. This assumes that the Rashadiya cement project
in the Central region would not go ahead and that there would be somewhat
slower growth in the Northern region, resulting in annual rates of increase
about 10% below those in the "probable" forecast.
B. Comparison of Alternatives
4.11       To determine the least-cost development program for meeting the
probable forecast to 1995, the respective least-cost solutions (in present-
worth terms) for the Northern and Central regions were first determined
separately, without interconnection, and then the summated costs of these
two solutions were compared with those of the least-cost solution for the
Northern and Central regions assuming interconnection. The main technical
and economic assumptions used for the least-cost evaluation are set out in
Annex 4.3.
4.12      Northern Region.  Four different development programs were selected
by the consultants for comparison, as covering the plausible range of alter-
natives for meeting the load forecast in the Northern region. The fuel,
operation and maintenance costs associated with each program were calculated
using a computer model to simulate the operation of the system to meet the
forecast power demand. The present worths of the cost streams (capital,
fuel, operation and maintenance) of the four programs were then calculated
over a range of discount rates from 0%-20%. A program providing for the
installation over the period 1985-1995 of five 120-MW base-load steam units,
and three 18-MW combustion turbines for peaking purposes, was found to have
the lowest present worth at discount rates up to 15%. This result was found
to be relatively insensitive to variations in the assumptions on load growth,
capital costs, fuel costs and exchange rate.



- 29 -
4.13      Central Region.  Steam plant would be uneconomic to supply the
relatively small loads in the Central region. The technical options con-
sidered therefore were diesel units and combustion turbines. Since there is
no interconnection in the Central region at present, the first step in the
analysis was to compare isolated generation at load centers with central
generation plus the transmission facilities needed to link the load centers.
The results showed that central supply from a diesel power plant at Ghor Safi
(where it is needed to supply the proposed potash complex) with transmission
links to Karak, Qatrana, Rashadiya and El Hasa would be the least-cost solu-
tion up to a discount rate of over 10%.
4.14      The next step was to determine the least-cost generation development
in the Central region to meet the probable load forecast to 1995, based on a
central diesel plant at Ghor Safi. For this purpose two alternative programs
were compared, both based on 10-MW diesel units, since no significant scale
economies would be obtainable with the recently introduced 18-MW size. The
first program assumed the installation of diesel units only through 1995,
while the second substituted a 15-MW combustion turbine for one of the diesel
units in 1983 as peaking reserve. The all-diesel program was found to have
the lowest present worth of costs up to a discount rate of over 20%, and this
result is relatively insensitive to variations in the main assumptions.
4.15      Northern and Central Regions Combined.  The final stage of the
least-cost analysis was to compare the merits of interconnection between the
Northern and Central regions with the summated least-cost solutions for each
region as determined above. Five different generation programs were selected
by the consultants for evaluation. The main differences between them related
to the date at which the transition from 66-MW to 120-MW steam units was
assumed to take place, and the inclusion in one of the programs of combined
cycle plant in place of further steam plant. A program involving the phased
installation of a 6 x 120-MW steam generating station in the North between
1985 and 1994, plus combustion turbines in 1984, 1991 and 1995, was found to
be the least-cost solution up to a discount rate of at least 15%. This pro-
gram, together with the required transmission facilities to link the Northern
and Central regions, was therefore compared with the summated separate least-
cost schemes for the two regions, and was found to be the least-cost for
all discount rates from zero to beyond 20%. Sensitivity tests indicated that,
as shown in Annex 4.3, this result is insensitive to variations in the assump-
tions on capital costs, fuel costs and value of foreign exchange, but is
relatively sensitive to the load growth assumed, the equalizing discount rate
being about 12% at the low load forecast.
C. Return on Investment
4.16      Given that the Project forms part of the least-cost power devel-
opment program as determined above, the final step in the analysis was to
determine the rate of return on the Project itself. This is the discount rate
which equalizes the present worths of the associated costs and benefits over



- 30 -
the economic life of the Project. The costs are the attributable financial
costs, adjusted for taxes, internal transfers and for any differences between
the money costs of inputs and their costs to the economy. The benefits
comprise the revenues from incremental sales of electricity attributable to
the Project, plus any other identifiable incremental benefits which can be
quantified.
4.17      The details of the calculation are given in Annex 4.4.  The main
adjustment to the financial costs related to fuel, for which the opportunity
cost, as measured by its export value, was used instead of the low domestic
price actually paid by JEA. The incremental electricity sales attributable
to the Project were valued at the average prices derived from the financial
projections (Annex 3.7). Additional benefits comprise customer payments in
the form of capital contributions by the three major industrial consumers to
be supplied, plus some small surplus benefits (fuel cost-savings and extra
government tax revenues) identifiable in connection with the rural electrifi-
cation component of the Project. The resulting rate of return on the Project
is about 13%. This underestimates the true rate of return since it evaluates
the transmission interconnection essentially as a means of bulk transfer of
electricity, ignoring the beneficial effects of capacity pooling and improved
security of supply; furthermore, it takes account only of the benefits to the
Central region of the transmission link, whereas its full benefit will be
realized only when the 132-kV transmission is extended to Aqaba in the South,
as envisaged in JEA's development program.
4.18      A separate calculation was made of the return on the rural electri-
fication component. As shown in Annex 4.4, this was found to be about 9%.
This represents a minimum value for the rate of return on the main assump-
tions used for the calculation, since it takes no account of unquantifiable
benefits, such as improvements in the quality of life in the rural areas and
reduced migration to the towns.
4.19      The calculated rates of return were tested for sensitivity to
variations in capital costs, fuel costs, load growth and the value of foreign
exchange. As shown in Annex 4.4, the return on the rural electrification
cost component varies from about 7% to 10%, being most sensitive to higher
capital costs. The return on the Project lies in the range of about 9% to
17% for variations in capital costs, fuel costs and load forecast, but is
more sensitive to changes in the exchange value of the Jordanian dinar because
of the relatively high import content of the equipment and fuel required for
the Project.

5.04      With the assurances listed above, the Project would provide a
suitable basis for a loan of US$15 million to the Government. The loan
would be repaid over a period of 17 years with 4 years of grace.
5.05       The condition of loan effectiveness include the signing by the
Government and JEA of the subsidiary loan agreement (para 5.01(d)). The
loan is expected to become effective within three months of loan signing.

Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
All financial forecasts are expressed in the fiscal years of
JEA beginning January 1 and ending December 31.
Income Statements
1. Electricity Sales: GWh generation and purchased power from Annex 1.6,
GWh sales from Annex 3.7.
2. Electricity Revenues: Assume present tariffs to average 12.9 fils/kWh
in 1978 and 13.4 fils/kWh in 1979 and assume an in-
crease of approximately 13,5% in 1980 to average 15.2
fils/kWh; and increases of 5% in 1983 to 16 fils/kWh,
17.2 fils/kWh in 1984 and 18.5 fils/kWh in 1985.
3.  Other Revenues:      Estimated at 6 to 8% of total sales, the decrease in
1978 and 1979 is due to the reduction of interest
charged on accounts receivable.
4. Purchases of Electricity: Purchases from Syria in 1977 averaged 7.9 fils/
kWh, the present tariff is as follows:
Day Period          6.0 fils/kWh
Peak Period        10.6 fils/kWh
Night Period        4.2 fils/kWh
The forecast assumes a 5% increase per year in the
average tariffs.
5.  Fuel Costs:          Estimates were made based on ranking of generating
units to determine total system generating costs.
Present fuel costs are as follows:

The projections assume 5% increases in 1979 and 1980, 8% increases for
1981-83 and 10% for 1984 and 1985.
6. Wages and Salaries: Assume an increase in the number of employees based

12. Accounts Receivable: In 1977 the Government had not paid JEPCO for the
assets of Marqa station that were transferred to JEA.
JEPCO withheld payment to JEA for electricity pur-
chased to collect for the Marqa assets and JEA in-
cluded these amounts as accounts receivable.   The
settlement of Government accounts are assumed in 1978
and receivables are estimated at approximately 60 days
billings from 1978 to 1985.
13. Inventories:          Assume two months fuel plus about 5% for spare parts
and inventories of maintenance items.
14. Capital:              Includes Government equity contributions to JEA with-
out any formal obligation of repayment.
15. Consumers' Contributions: JEA requires that consumers pay certain portions
of costs for the expansion of their system to serve
the consumer.   The projections include US$5 million
for the Arab Potash Co. and US$4 million for the
Phosphate Works.
16. Reserves:             Legal - 10% of net income.
Rural Electrification - 1 fil/kWh of sales to finance
rural electrification.
Revenue - Balance of net income after reserve requirements.
Termination - Estimates of requirements to pay sever-
ance pay for employees retired based on years
of service of the employee.
Revaluation - Amount added to Gross Fixed Assets for
revaluation of assets.
17. Accounts Payable:    Average 10% of fuel costs plus one month's salaries,
and about 3% of gross fixed assets.

3. Diversity Factor
(a) Northern Region
In determining the combined load of the Northern region, the maximum
demands of JEPCO, IDECO, JVA, Queen Alia Airport and King Talal Dam were assumed
to be coincident, but a diversity factor of 0.95 was applied to the loads of
Fuheis cement works and Zarqa refinery.
(b) Central Region
The combined load forecast for the central region as an interconnected
system assumed a diversity factor of 0.95 between the individual loads.
(c) Northern and Central Regions Combined
No diversity was assumed between the maximum demands of the two regions.

6. Foreign Exchange
1 JD = US$3.30
7. Fuel Costs
Internal fuel prices in Jordan are controlled by the Government and
bear no necessary relation to international prices. For the economic analysis
fuel costs should be based on the opportunity costs of the fuel, which is all
expected to be supplied by the Zarqa refinery. Since the alternative to internal
use would be export, the opportunity cost is the export value. Gas oil and
kerosene are supplied to Syria at ex-refinery prices of JD 36 and JD 40/ton
respectively, which were adopted for the economic analysis. Some quantities
of residual fuel from the Zarqa refinery are supplied for bunkering at Aqaba
at a current price of JD 23/ton. The cost of transporting the oil from Zarqa
to Aqaba is JD 3.50/ton, giving a net price of JD 19.50/ton. This is thought
to be on the low side because of the temporarily depressed state of the market
for residual fuel oil, and a price of JD 21.20 ($70/ton) was therefore adopted.
The fuel prices used for the economic analysis, therefore were
as follows:

Return on Project
1.       Separate calculations were made of
(a)  the return on the Project as a whole, and
(b)  the return on the rural electrification component of the Project-.
The specific teclhnical and economstic assumptions used for the calculations, wbere
they differ from those used for the least-cost analysis (see Annex 4.3), are
set out below.
2. Annuitized Capital Costs
The annuitized capital costs of generating capacity required to meet
1 kW of incremental peak demand on the JEA interconnected system, based on
JEA's installation program to meet the 1981-85 requirements, was estitmated at
JD 25.78 pea. (assuming 10% discount rate).
3. Transmission and Distribution 0 & M
Transmission (1% of capital costs):               JD 152,000 p.a.
Rura:l Distribution (2.3% of capital costs):    JD  46,000 p.a.
4. Losses
Station use:                 5%
Transmission:              3.5%
Rural distribution:          8%
5. Benefits
The benefits comprise the following items:
(a) revenues from JEA's bulk sales (net of the rural electrification
requirements) attributable to the Project over the forecast period,
based on the average values derived from the financial projectioiis
(Annex 3.7);
(b)  revenues from the attributable rural electrification sales, assuming
the average values derived from the financial projections (Annex 3.7)3
(c3)  capi:.al ecntributions from the three major bulk consumers to be
supp.lied (Ghor Safi potash complex, El Hasa phosphate minc and
Ras,ivldiya cemnent works);
(d)  connection charges payable by the new rural consumers (JD 20 pe-r
consumer); and

(e) surplus benefits of the rural electrification component of the
Project in the form of
(i)    extra Government tax revenues, estimated at JD 21,000 p.a.,
from the sale of electrical appliances and equipment; and
(ii)    net savings in fuel costs and maintenance costs of non-
electric appliances and equipment through substitution of
electrical appliances.
