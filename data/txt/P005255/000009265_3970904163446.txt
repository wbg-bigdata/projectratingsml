PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THIRD POWER PROJECT - LOAN 1688-JO
PREFACE
The Project, supported by Loan 1688-JO for US$15.0 million made to
the Government of Jordan and relent to Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA),
consisted of 132-kV transmission lines and substations to supply certain
industrial and rural distribution loads in the central region of Jordan, a
system operation control center, electrification of 39 villages in the central
region and a training program for JEA's engineering and accounting staff. The
loan was closed on the criginal closing date of June 30, 1983 and except for a
sum of $0.62 million was fully disbursed by that date. Final disbursement was
made on October 25, 1983 when the account was closed. This Project Completion
Retort (PCR) was prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North Africa Regional
Office based on the Bank's appraisal report, supervision reports and other
documents in the Bank's files, a completion report prepared by JEA in December
1983 and on the findings of a project completion mission Which visited Jordan
in November 1983.
The PCR summarizes the main points of interest. The loan was the
third of a continuing series of IDA credits and Bank loans to JEA, begun in
1973, which have helped develop JEA  into an efficient and financially viable
national public utility.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following normal procedures, OED sent a copy of the draft report to
the Government and JEA. Comments received from the Ministry of Finance, the
National Planning Council and JEA are reproduced as Attachments A, B and C
respectively.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THIrD POWER PROJECT - LOAN 1688-JO
HIGHLIGHTS
The purpose of the Project was to supply the electric power needs of
a potash complex, phosphate mining works, a cement plant and rural
distribution loads in the central region of Jordan, to further the long-range
objective of interconnecting the entire country and to continue the
institution-building effort started under the earlier Bank Group lending
operatLons. The Project, as finally implemented, consisted of about 300 km of
132-kV double-circuit transmission lines, six new 132/33(11)-kV substations
and extension of two existing substations, a system operation control center,
with power line carrier and related courmunication equipment, electrification
of 39 villages in the central region and a training program for JEA's
engineering and accounting staff.
The Project fully accomplished its objectives (paras 3.06 and 3.08)
and achieved a re-estimated economic return of about 13%, the same as was
estimated at appraisal (para. 4.01). The re-estimated economic return on the
rural electrification component was about 8% against 9% estimated at appraisal
(para. 4.01). The Project significantly contributed to the development of JEA
as a well-managed, efficient and financially viable public utility. There is
one aspect of JEA's development which must be noted, namely JEA's dependence
on Government subsidies to compensate for increased fuel costs arising from
Government's policy of not allowing it to automatically implement the fuel
adjustment charge in its tariffs (para 3.10).
Despite a substantial increase in the Project scope (increase from
about 225 km of 132-kV double-circuit transmission lines to about 300 km, from
five new substations to six and from 33 villages to 39), the final Project
cost was within the appraisal estimate. A 23Z reduction in the cost of
transmission lines as a result of keen competition in bidding fully
compensated for cost increases in other components. Except for the rural
electrification and control center components, the Project was completed
before the original estimated date of December 31, 1982. The rural
electrification component required 21Z more time than anticipated partly
because of the increase in the number of villages from 33 to 39. The control
center component (7% of total Project cost) required about 19% more time than
anticipated partly because of the contractor's delay in execution and partly
because of the addition of an independent building to the center.

THIRD POWER PROJECT - LOAN 1688-JO
I. INTRODUCTION
Background
E          1.01     Prior to 1967, Jordan's power subsector was highly fragmented,
consisting of three fairly large private companies supplying power to the
cities of Jerusalem, Amman and Irbid, a number of municipal undertakings and
many small local installations on industrial and Government premises; all
relying on diesel engines for electrical generation. There was no coordinared
development program for the sector and the service was unreliable. In order
to make good these deficiencies, the Government, in early 1967, created the
Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA) with a mandate to coordinate development
and extend electricity supplies to all areas of the Kingdom, not already
included in the licenses of existing undertakings. In addition, JEA is
required to serve as a regulatory body of the Government for the two main
distribution companies in the country, the Jordan Electric Power company
responsible for electricity distribution in the city of Amman, and the Irbid
District electricity company responsible for electricity supply in the
Governorate of Irbid.
Bank Group's Involvement in the Power Sector
1.02     In 1973 and 1975 IDA made two Credits to the Government of Jordan for
the development of the power sector, the first in 1973 for $10.2 million to
finance two 33-MW steam power units and one 13-MW combustion turbine at the
Hussein thermal power plant at Zarqa near Amman; and the second in 1975 for ¢5
million to finance the third 33-SW steam power unit at the Hussein thermal
power plant, reconditioning of the diesel electric power plant at Marqa and
the southern Jordan power development study. The Projects were successfully
completed. The important achievements under these Credits were the
establishment of an economical and reliable power supply service, the
development of JEA as an autonomous and financially viable entity responsible
*           for the whole power sector and the establishment of a tariff structure based
on marginal costs enabling JEA to earn a rate of return of a minimum 9% on
assets. The Credits were also instrumental in attracting investments in the
*           power sector by other co-financing agencies such as the Kuwait and Arab
Funds. A joint completion report covering these Projects was prepared in June
1981 and submitted to the Board in March 1982.



-2-
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01     Project Appraisal, Negotiations and Effectiveness
In response to a Government request for Bank financing for a third
power project, a Bank mission identified the Project (March 1978), the
feasibility study for which had been prepared by a firm of expatriate
consultants.  The project was appraised in October 1978 and negotiations took
place in March 1979. Two changes of substance were agreed upon during the
negotiations: (a) as requested by the Jordanian delegation, the loan was made
to the Government for relending to JEA; and (b) at the Government's request
the loan was increased from $10 million to $15 million, thus eliminating the
need for cofinancing except for a small sum of $0.15 million from an existing
Arab Fund loan. The loan was signed on May 4, 1979 and became effective
October 11, 1979, a little over two months later than originally anticipated,
due to the delay in ratifying the loan and project agreements.
Project Description
2.02     As originally appraised, the Project covered part of a 4-year (1979-
1982) time slice of JEA's development program and consisted of:
(a) about 225 km of 132-kV double-circuit transmission lines;
(b) five 132/33(11)-kV substations, with a total power transformer
capacity of 221 MVA, and extension of two existing substations;
(c) a system operations control center, with power line carrier and
related communication equipment;
(d) electrification of 33 villages in the central region of Jordan;
(e) consulting services for Project engineering and construction; and
(f) a training program for JEA's engineering and accounting staff.
Changes in Project Scope
2.03     During Project execution, certain modifications to the Project were
necessitated by:
(i)  a change in the transmission network to adjust to the system
development; and
(ii)  the need to increase the reliability, and flexibility in
operation, of the system.
Accordingly, in agreement with the Bank, the length of 132-kV double-circuit
transmission lires was increased from about 225 km to about 300 km, the number
of 132/33(11)-kV substations was increased from five to six and the total
transformer capacity from 221 NVA to 324 MVA. The number of villages
electrified was also increased from 33 to 39.



-3-
Project Objectives
2.04     The main objectives of the Project were to:
(a)  further the long range sectoral objective of progressively
interconnecting the northern, central and southern regions of
Jordan and creating an economic and reliable electric power
system serving the whole country;
(b)  supply from the main public power system part of the electric
power needs of a potash complex, phosphate mining works at El
Hasa, a cement plant at Rashadiya and rural distribution loads
in the central region of Jordan; and
(c)  continue the institution-building effort started with the
establishment of JEA in 1967, the improvement of power sector
planning and the development of appropriate policies for power
sector financing.
Overall, the Project has fully achieved the above objectives.

III.  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Project Execution
3.01     Although no major problems affected Project implementation, there
were delays in implementation of various components arising from:
(i) the increase in project scope;
(ii) delays on the part of JEA in obtaining access to the sites of
some substations;
(iii) congestion at the port of Aqaba causing delays in deliveries
of imported equipment;
(iv) the usual problems encountered in erecting transmission line
such as bad weather, protests of local population regarding
the routing of the line, etc.; and
(v) delays in execution by some contractors.
The original Project implementation period was estimated to be the four-year
period 1979-1982. Three contracts (substations, transmission lines and
transformers) out of six were completed in 1982 before the date of completion
estimated at appraisal. The remaining three were completed only during 1983.
Two of these related to the Control Center, the total estimated cost of whicl
was only about 7% of the total Project cost. The third contract involved the
electrification of 39 villages, where the completion time exceeded the original
implementation period by about 21%. In most cases, the delay was partly due
to the reasons given above. JEA is considering the levy of penalty on the
contractors for part of the delay in the case of substations, control center
(equipment) and rural electrification. The actual dates of commissioning of
the various components are given below, with the original contractual
commissioning dates in parentheses:
- 132-kV Network:
Transmission lines          March 6, 1982 (2/1/82)
Substations                 September 12, 1982 (12/31/81)
Control Center              September 26, 1983 (6/15/82)
- Rural Electrification         November 1, 1983 (1/12/82)
Training
3.02     The Project included training abroad of JEA's staff from the
Transmission and Distribution Department and from the Finance Department.
Such a training program, which was also financed by other co-financiers, was
satisfactorily completed, and 11 Engineers and eight Technicians were trained
abroad (Greece, Finland, Switzerland, UK, USA) for periods ranging fron 4 weeks
to 4 months. Three Accountants were also trained abroad, one in the USA for
14 weeks and two with the Electricity Authority of Cyprus for 5 to 6 weeks.
In addition, engineers and technicians were trained in Jordan (180 man-months
in the case of engineers and 136 man-months in the case of technicians) with a



-5-
view to upgrading their skills. The program of training greatly succeeded in
enhancing the skills of JEA's staff and significantly raised JEA's planning
and implementation skills.
Procurement
3.03     Procurement of all goods, works  and services under the Project was
completed through six contracts, five awarded on the basis of international
*         competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group Guidelines.  In regard
to the sixth contract covering supply and erection of substations, there was a
lack of agreement between JEA and its consultants on the one hand, and the
-        Bank on the other, regarding the contract award after international
competitive bids were obtained. The Bank suggested award of the contract to
expatriate firm 'A', the lowest responsive bidder, whereas JEA and its
consultants proposed to award the contract to expatriate firm 'B', the second
lowest evaluated bidder, on project grounds - avoidance of risk of split
responsibility for delays, equipment reliability, relative probability of
meeting the required commissioning date, etc., arising from the following:
(a) firm 'B' had superior qualifications and experience compared
with the lowest evaluated bidder;
(b) the firm itself was the manufacturer of most of the equipment
whereas the lowest evaluated bidder was only buying the
equipment from other suppliers; and
(c) the difference in prices between the two was small and in fact
the award to firm 'B' would probably result in a lower
long-term cost.
Because the bid of firm 'A' was responsive and was clearly the lowest, the
Bank could not agree with JEA on this matter. It was therefore agreed with
the Bank that the contract be fully financea by JEA without any Bank funding.
However, the Bank recognized that JEA exercised reasonable technical judgement
and that its decision to award the contract to firm 'B' was not imprudent in a
commercial sense. Accordingly, the Bank agreed to reallocate the appropriate
portion of this category to other items/categories and the percentages of
disbursements in respect of the goods and works covered under the other
contracts were increased to permit full disbursement of the loan.
Project Cost
3.04     Annex l  gives a comparison of the actual and estimated costs of the
Project. The actual Project cost is very close to the appraisal estimate in
spite of the increase in the scope of the Project (para. 2.03). This is
because of the lower-than-expected prices that JEA got for the final contracts
as a result of the keen competition between contractors. There is a decrease
in the cost of transmission lines of JD 1.8 million (23Z) in spite of an
increase in the length of the transmission lines to 300 km from the appraisal
estimate of 225 km, because of a steep fall in the final unit price of
transmission lines to about 47% below the estimated price. The reduction in
the cost of the transmission lines just about compensated for the increase in
the cost of the substations of JD 0.53 million (10%), of rural electrification
of JD 0.28 million (14%) and of the control center of JD 0.93 milion (530%).



The sharp increase in the cost of the control center arose because the
estimated cost mistakenly did not include the cost of the power line carrier,
telecontrol and telecommunication equipment for the six new substations and
for the extension of the existing two substations, and also the cost of the
independent building.
Disbursements
3.05     Annex 2 compares the actual disbursements with the appraisal                      .
estimates. The actual disbursements were slower than expected primarily
because of delays in contract awards and also in the commissioning of some
components of the Project.  However, except for a sum of $0.62 million, the
loan was fully disbursed by June 30, 1983. Final disbursement was made on
October 25, 1983.
Operating Performance
3.06         The facilities constructed under the Project have operated
satisfactorily during the short period since their commissioning. The
transmission lines and substations have provided adequate supply to the
industrial loads in the central region, assured security of supply to these
loads in the central region and to Amman and a substantial power transfer
capability in the transmission network in Jordan. The Operation Control
Center has not been in operation sufficiently long to enable well-grounded
conclusions to be drawn about its operating performance. However, the Center
is beginning to play a useful role in the task of load dispatching. The
electrification of the 39 villages in the central region, where the population
had the lowest access to public electricity supply, has been instrumental in
raising the level of access in that region from 30X to 58Z, close to the
national average of about 622. Annex 3 gives the estimated and actual sales
of JEA for the period 1979-1983. The decrease in actual sales ranged from
16-29Z, the main reason for the lower sales being the slower-than-expected
growth of industrial loads.
Financial Performance
3.07     Under the loan covenants, JEA was required to earn a minimum return
of 9% on revalued assets. During the appraisal of the subject Project, JEA
argued, and the Bank agreed, that since most of its assets were newly
installed as of 1978, their book value was not very different from their                    0
current value in 1979. Under the subject Project, it was also agreed that not
later than December 31, 1981, the assets of JEA would be revalued to reflect
the effects of inflation on the value of assets in service.  Therefore, JkA
could compute the required rate of return in 1980 on the book value of its
assets. Under the Fourth Power Project, the rate of return covenant was
replaced by a cash generation covenant from January 1981 requiring JEA to
achieve a cash generation level of at least 25Z in 1981, 1982 and 1983.
3.08     Because tariffs were not raised to keep pace with operating costs,
JEA's rate of return in 1979 was only 4.6% as against the required 9Z.
However, since the net internal cash generation in 1979 was about 22% of
construction requirements, the real objective of the covenant, namely, internal
generation of a reasonable proportion of JEA's expansion requirements was
largely met. In 1980, a very large tariff increase in February 1980 raised



-7-
the rate of return to 9.7Z and the net internal cash generation to about 51Z
of construction requirements. In 1981 and l982, the cash generation level was
24% and 29Z, respectively as against the required 25Z. In 1983 also, JEA was
expected to reach the required cash generation level of at least 25Z.
3.09     Annex 4 gives the estimated (appraisal) and actual Income Statements
of JEA for the period 1979-1983 showing the estimated and actual rates of
return for 1979 and 1980, and the estimated and actual cash generation for
L981-1983 .
3.10     There is one feature of JE&'s present financial management that
should be noted, and that arises from Government's policy of not allowing it
to automatically implement the fuel adjustment charge in its tariffs. The
Government's intention is to increase electricity rates gradually and thus
restrain inflationary pressures, but Government subsidies Lo compensate JE&
for fuel price increases increase JEA's dependence on Government. Apart from
this dependence on Government, Government subsidies should not, in the long
run, be an acceptable substitute for revenue from consumers , because the
system of subsidies goes against the principle of the consumer paying for the
full cost of the service. 11
Institutional Development
3.11     Until 1975, the activities of JE&A were primarily the operation of a
concrete pole plant and supervision of certain projects of JEPCO and IDECO
that were financed by loans from the UK relent through JEA. Since 1975, with
the technical assistance provided through the Bank Group projects, JE& has
developed fast into a well-organized and well-managed semi-autonomous public
utility that is both efficient and financially viable. Through the completion
of the subject Project, JEA has maintained an adequate and reliable supply of
electricity throughout the country, with all the population centers, except
Aqaba, 2/ linked to a national grid. Its staff of 1521 (December 1983) are
increasLngly capable of undertaking all its functions, thus lessening its
dependence on external consultants for feasibility studies, design and
supervision of projects. Through the impetus provided by the subject Project,
and the successful completion of the training scheme, it has developed
adequate power subsector planning capabilities within itself and also
significantly improved the various skills of its staff. Through appropriate
salary administration and other measures, it has substantially halted the
exodus of its staff to the neighboring countries and has succeeded in
stabilizing its work force. As required under the subject Project, it fully
implemented by mid-1980 a suitable computerized accounting system that had
been recommended by an expatriate firm of consultants, a remarkable
achievement in itself. Whereas in the past, JEA's investments were financed
primarily from the national budget and foreign borrowings, it is now able to
finance internally about 25% of its substantial investments, a fact that
attests to its sound financial management.

IV. ECONOMIC RE-EVALWATION
Economic Re-evaluation
4.01     At the time of appraisal in 1979, the economic rate of return for the
entire project was estimated at 13Z which was higher than the opportunity cost
of capital of IOZ. However, the rate of return on the rural component was
only 9Z. In computing the rate of return on the rural component the
unquantifiable social benefits associated with the component were not taken
into consideration. At project completion, the economic rate of return for
the entire project is estimated at about 13% and for the rural component
slightly more than 8x. The rate of return for the entire project compares
favorably with the opportunity cost of capital of 10%. However, the economic
rate of return for the rural component still remains below the opportunity
cost of capital. The assumptions underlying the computation are presented in
Annex 5. The appraisal estimate of the economic rate of return and the
present estimate are the same mainly because of the following;
(i) Capital Cost - No significant real increases in capital cost
occurred over the construction period. Estimates of capital costs
were close to actual;
(ii) Load Forecasts - The appraisal forecasts of consumption in the
project area for 1981-83 were significantly higher than the
actuals. On the basis of the actuals for these years and more
recent information on potential new consumers and overall
projected economic performance, the appraisal forecasts have been
modified. The appraisal forecasts remain higher on the average by
about 5X up to 1991. Thereafter, the revised forecasts are about
5% higher each year up to year 2012, the last year of the
analysis. On the whole, the impact of the load forecasts on the
current analysis and that at appraisal is about the same. The
lower forecasts in the earlier years is compensated for by the
slightly higher forecasts in the later years;
(iii)  Fuel Cost and Tariffs - The increased fuel cost used in the
current analysis is compensated by the increase in tariffs; and
(iv) Valuation of Benefits - In both cases, the existing tariffs were
used as measures of consumption benefits. Among the other
benefits were included tax revenue to the Government arising from
proposed increased sales of electrical appliances by consumers in
the project area. Such benefits are not taken into account in the
current analysis since they are a transfer payment to Government
and the economic analysis of power projects in the Bank is usually
in efficiency terms, i.e., excluding any "savings premium". This
is partly the reason why the current estimates of the economic
rate of return on the rural component are slightly lower than the
appraisal estimate. The same levels of consumer surplus arising
from substitution of petroleum products used in rural households
by electricity are used in both analyses.

-14-                          ANNEX 5
Page 1 of 2
Assumptions Underlying Re-evaluation of Economic Rate of Return
1. Capital Cost - The Project cost including physical contingencies is
expressed in constant 1983 prices. The following rates of inflation were
adopted to escalate costs to 1983 levels:
1989      1980       1981      1982       1983
Local (Z)             11         11        11          8         8
Foreign (Z)            6         6          7          8         7.5
A 25-year economic life of the project is adopted.
2. Economic Cost of Supply - Long run marginal cost of supply for generation
was taken as a proxy for the economic cost of new facilities that would be
needed to meet demand for electricity. This includes capacity cost of
generation of JD 22.51kW/a in 1983 prices based on:
(a) capital cost of units 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Hussein Thermal Power
Station and 60 MW gas turbine;
(b) operation and maintenance cost of about 2Z per year of capital cost;
of generation.
(c) the cost of fuel based on border prices of US300/ton for gas oil and
USgl60/ton for fuel oil, representing the cost to Jordan in
March 1983 of importing these products from Saudi Arabia.
3. Fixed 0 & M Cost - Taken as 0.5% p.a. of capital cost of transmission up
to 1990 and 1Z p.a. thereafter. For distribution, 1% p.a. of capital cost
is adopted up to 1990 and 2% p.a. of capital cost thereafter.
4. Average Revenue - Average revenue of 28 fils/kWh for bulk consumers is
used as a proxy for the willingness to pay. For rural consumers, the
average retail tariff of 36.6 fils/kWh is used as a proxy for the
willingness to pay.
5. Customer Contributions - A one-time customer contribution of a weighted
average of JD 85 made by each rural consumer when service is provided for
the first time is regarded as a benefit.  This contribution is estimated
to cover the cost of the equipment (meters, etc.) installed in the
customer's premises.



-15-                            ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 2
6. Savings Through Households Fuel Displacement - There are additional
savings which accrue from the substitution of electricity for kerosene and
LPG currently being used in households. The average consumption of
petroleum products by households consists of 20% LPG at JD 124/ton and 80%
kerosene at JD 110/ton, which is equal to JD 113/ton. It is estimated
that ach household consumes about 0.56 ton of petroleum products/year and
tha _t takes about 1,000 kWh/year to provide that service, equivalent to
63- fils/kWh compared with existing tariffs of 36.6 fils/kWh.  Therefore,
27 fils/kWh is used as a measure of the savings accruing from the
substitution of electricity for fuel used by households. The average
equivalent electrical energy of 1,000 kWh/year per zousehold only
represents the fuel displaced in domestic uses.  Presently, the average
electricity consumption per household is estimated at about 1,200 kWh.
The difference between the average level of consumption and the equivalent
fuel displacement presumably represents electricity usage by small
domestic electrical appliances.

COMMENTS FROM JEA
JORDAN ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY
Ref. : 3/2/43/11021
Date : May, 1984
Incoming letter from JEA to Mr. Shiv S. Kapur, Director, OED.
May, 1984
Reference is made to your letter of April 18,
1984 together with the draft of the Third Power
Project completion Report.
I would like to summarize hereunder our comments
on the said report:-
1-   Page 1- Background:                               EMENA Region Note:
We noticed that there is no mention of the
power subsector in the West Bank of Jordan        Para. 1.01 of PCR
prior to 1967. There is a large private           revised.
company at Jerusalem supplying power to
Jerusalem and its surrounding towns and villages.
In addition, the major towns outside the
concession area of Jerusalem Company are supplied
by municipal undertakings, mainly Nablus
municipality in the North.
2-   Page 2 parag. 2.02                                EMENA Region Note:
It is mentioned that the project covered part
of the 4-year (1979-1982) development program    Para. 2.02 of PCR
of JEA.                                           revised.
There was no 4-year development program for JEA.
All JEA projects are part of the electricity
sector in the Jordan's Five Year Plans. The
latest five year plan covers the period (1981-
1985).
3-   Page 4-Parag. 3.01                                EMENA Region Note:
One of the main reasons for the delay in the
project is:                                       Para. 3.01 of PCR

Note:- Aqaba was connected to the rlational
Grid on 9/2/1984.
We hope that you would kindly be able to take
the above mentioned comments into consideration when
formulating the final report. We would like also to
thank you for this excellent completion report.
