A. SUMMARY

The closing date of Education for All- Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) Catalytic Trust
Fund for Cambodia: Education Sector Support Scale Up Action Program (ESSSUAP)
Grant Number TF092097 will be extended from June 30, 2012 to December 31, 2012 in
order to allow sufficient time to complete ongoing civil works (construction of schools)
that were delayed because of recent floods. Proceeds for the Trust Fund TF092097 will
also be reallocated. All other aspects of project design and development including
objectives, outcomes, design, and scope will remain the same. The Project Development
Objective and outcome targets are expected to be met within the revised timeframe.

B. PROJECT STATUS

Implementation progress
After a slower than expected program starting, the ESSSUAP is now a well performing
project. Likelihood of achieving the Project Development Objective and Implementation
progress are both rated Satisfactory. All twelve Performance Indicators have made
progress. Four indicators meet the planned targets, the other four indicators exceed
targets and the remaining four indicators fail to reach the benchmarks primarily due to the
effect of a reduction in construction activities. The number of primary school buildings
constructed was reduced from 650 to 492, mainly due to delays caused by slow
implementation of contract agreements by some construction companies and difficulties
in finding qualified civil works contractors to participate in bid tenders. The best
performing indicators are indicators of Early Childhood Development, School
Improvement Grants and training sessions for teachers, principals and government
officials.

Disbursement
As of April 2012, the current disbursement amount stands at US$45.13 million;
approximately 78.64% of the total project amount. Last calendar year (2011) alone, US$
19.9 million (34.7% of the total amount) was disbursed following the clearing of
operational bottlenecks, resulting in sizable volume of civil works successfully
implemented.

Financial covenant
There is no overdue audit report. The latest audit report for FY2010 was submitted
within the deadline of June 30, 2011 and the audit opinion was unqualified. The
unaudited quarterly interim financial reports have also been submitted regularly.




                                            4
C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Closing date
The closing date will be extended from June 30, 2012 to December 31, 2012 in order to
allow sufficient time to complete ongoing civil works (construction of schools) that were
delayed because of recent floods. Due to the heavy flooding that affected Cambodia in
October 2011, progress on civil work activities was significantly delayed. The flood
prevented the construction team from accessing most construction sites (both in-progress
and scheduled) for approximately three months. In some unfortunate cases, the flood
destroyed bridges and roads to sites and thus prevented team access for more than three
months. Since progress on civil works over the yearly rainy season from May to October
cannot be expected, the project thus needs to be extended through the end of December
2012 to complete all planned civil work activities. This will be the second extension and
a cumulative extension of 30 months.


Reallocations
Proceeds for the Trust Fund will be reallocated, mainly from the unallocated category.
The reallocation will finance the expansion of teacher training to focus on improving
reading competencies of students in early grades and other prioritized in-service training
to support sustainability after project closing. Provision of the in-service training
activities is expected to reduce the high drop-out and repetition rate, thereby increasing
the completion rate of the primary education cycle. The expanded activity is in line with
stated objectives of the PDO: “to speed up progress towards improved grade 1 right-age
entry, net enrollment, retention, progression rates and grade 6 completion rates in primary
education.?


As a result, the proceeds will be reallocated as follow:
