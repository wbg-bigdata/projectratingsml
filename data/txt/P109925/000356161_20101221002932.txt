                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER

SUMMARY
The proposed restructuring reflects the Royal Government of Cambodia's (RGC)
decision to cancel the Merit-Based Performance Incentive (MBPI), Priority Mission
Group (PMG) and all other salary supplement and incentive schemes with effect from
January 1, 2010, regardless of the source of financing, and to replace it with the
establishment of Priority Operating Costs (POC).
The Government-Donor Coordination Committee (GDCC) has indeed agreed on the
following twin-track approach:
      Under track 1, a compensation reform is being defined in the short-term and
         implemented over the medium term, as part of the National Program for
         Administrative Reform (NPAR);
      Under track 2, a temporary scheme, also called Priority Operating Costs (POC)
         that addresses the short-term issue of service delivery and reform implementation
         has been agreed upon.
Both tracks are expected to progress in parallel with regular reviews to (i) assess progress
toward compensation reform; (ii) feed lessons from POC to compensation reform; and
(iii) decide on the merits of revising, continuing, or stopping the POC arrangement.

The framework for the second track is provided by the Government sub-decree approved
on 12th July, 2010. Under this framework, the POC embeds meritocratic, equity, and
transparency principles. It applies to all development partners. It is explicitly conceived
as a complement to track 1 of reform, i.e. a temporary mechanism that will be
discontinued once the compensation reform takes over. The agencies where a POC
scheme is established will ensure that it is unified across the various projects for which it
is established.

With regard to Ministry of Education, Youth, Sports, the POC scheme covers two
projects supported by Education For All Fast Track Initiative Catalytic Fund and World
Bank for promoting more efficient and effective human resource management based on
result based performance evaluation at central and provincial levels.

The proposed restructuring will allow for the financing of POC by (i) creating a new
disbursement category for POC. A disbursement condition will be added for this new
category, requesting that the POC arrangements (comprising terms of reference,
management contract and implementation agreement as per the POC guidelines) agreed
between the ministry and the Council of Administration Reform (CAR) and the Ministry
of Economy and Finance (MEF), is acceptable to the Bank and will not be changed
without prior consultation with the Bank.

PROJECT STATUS
The Education Sector Support Scale Up Action Program (ESSSUAP) is a well
performing project. The development objective of the ESSSUAP is to assist the Recipient
to speed up progress towards improved grade 1 right-age entry, net enrollment, retention,
progression rates and grade 6 completion rates in primary education. Following initial
delays in the process of civil work sub-components, project closing date was extended for
two years up to June 2012 to adjust to a revised implementation schedule. Currently the
project implementation including sizable civil works is progressing well in accordance
with the revised timeline. Other quality related sub-components are also moving along
effectively in ways that will help meet the project development objective. Transparency
and accountability continue to feature strongly in all activities, legal covenants are fully
complied and a good governance framework is in place. The current amounts disbursed
as of December 13, 2010 stand at US$17.36 million, which is approximately 30.24% of
the total amount.



PROPOSED CHANGES

      Financing
          o Reallocations

               There was no MBPI category in the original budget; however, the original
               program document indicated the possibility of MBPI financing; the
               arrangements for this to happen had not yet been set-up at the time when
               MBPI was cancelled.

               The POC fund of US$300,510.00 equal to 100% of the scheme comes
               from "Unallocated" expenditure category.

           The following condition will apply for disbursement under POC category:
           No withdrawal under category (3) shall be made until POC arrangements
           (comprising terms of reference, number of positions, management contract
           and implementation agreement as per the POC guidelines), acceptable to
           the Association, are agreed between the concerned agency and the Council
           of Administration Reform (CAR) and the Ministry of Economy and
           Finance (MEF). Such arrangements will not be changed without prior
           consultation with the Association.

   Financial management

    Overall FM arrangements will remain unchanged. The Supplementary Financial
    Management Manual for the Project will be updated to incorporate the payment of
    POC. The POC will be audited as part of the project financial statements
    annually.
