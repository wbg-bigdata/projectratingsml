IEUOIANDUM AND UCO)OEKDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOYPENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO IMDIA
FOR A NATIONAL AIDS CONTROL PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed credit to
India is submitted for approval. The credit, for SDR 59.8 million (US$84.0
million equivalent), would be on standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity. The
credit would help finance a National AIDS Control Project. The proceeds of the
credit would be passed by the Government of India (GOI) to the States and Union
Territories (UTs) in accordance with standard arrangements for development
assistance to States and UTs.
2.        gg=Moector  Ba               The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
epidemic in India has been described as a "silent volcano". Current estimates
of HIV prevalence vary between 300,000 and 500,000 people. By September 1991,
5,706 sero-positive cases were reported, as well as 96 clinically overt cases of
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV infected persons have been
identified in every State with HIV testing capabilities. The rate of sero-
positivity is increasing rapidly and the dimensions of the epidemic are massive.
3.        Heterosexual transmission is predominant and the blood supply is
unsafe.   Transmission is facilitated by  the high  incidence of sexually
transmitted diseases (STD) and high infection rates among prostitutes and their
clients for both STDs and HIV. STDs are associated with the same risk behaviors
that put a person at risk for HIV infection and facilitate both the acquisition
and transmission of HIV. Infection is also being spread through iatravenous drug
use, especially in the Northeastern States.
4.        The UIV epidemic is relatively recent in India.  Initial responrss are
in their early stages and limited in scope and resources. Present levels of
public expenditure on AIDS are very low. Prom 1986 to 1991, the Ministry of
Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) allocated only US$6 million to AIDS Control and
an additional US$3.4 million were given to the States to improve blood safety.
Existing STD services lack basic resources and are underfunded. In addition, the
public sector lacks the technical and operational skills and access to the risk
behavior groups and communities that are needed to control the spread of HIV/AIDS
effectively. GOI is establishing institutional mechanisms and guidelines to
effectively address the legal and ethical aspects pertaining to the management
of its AIDS control interventions.
5.        The financial impact of dealing with AIDS cases is likely to be
significant. Under current epidemiological conditions in India, it is projected
that there will be about one million overt AIDS cases by the year 2000, in
addition to several million silent HIV infections. Direct costs of care incurred
by the Union and State Governments would escalate yearly to reach a total of
about US$1.3 billion by the year 2000, in addition to other direct costs in the
private sector. The indirect national income loss is estimated to be about US$1
billion equivalent for every 100,000 AIDS related deaths.



t~~~~~~~~~~~~
6.        Lei'ons of gaperience.  There is no past Bank Group experience in
financing AIDS control in India. However, the Bank Group to date has financed
one free standing AIDS project in Zaire and AIDS components in several projects.
In additin, considerable international experience has been accumulated from both
developed and developing countries. The main conclusions to date include:
(a) the need for speed, because intervening at the initial stages of the
epidemic's development has a greater impact and a higher benefit-cost ratio than
intervening at a later stage; (b) the need for a multi-pronged approach while
prioritizing among interventions; (c) the importance of targeting core groups for
cost-effective measures; (d) the importance of controlling STDs; (e) mass media
is important for changing social norms, while targeting specific groups through
direct contact interventions is important for affecting behavioral ch.ange within
those groups; (f) socio-cultural determinants are critical for considering
strategies for influencing risk behavior; and (g) there is a need to go beyond
the formal health sector in multisectoral directions.
7.        The seven World Bank-assisted population projects, one maternal and
child health project, and two nutrition projects in India have generally been
implemented satisfactorily, with modest delays in the early part of the project.
The completed Tamil Nadu Nutrition Project had a very positive impact on the
nutrition status of malnourished young children. The Fourth Population Project,
the Fifth Population Project, and the Health Component of the Third Calcutta
Urban Development Project are ongoing but are already showing positive results
on morbidity and fertility. However, lessons of experience suggest that greater
attention needs to be paid to: the financing and management of projects; the
management and supervision of staff; the training of personnel; the planning of
work routines; and, the supply of needed goods and materials.
8.        Rat iole gfX IDA Imvolvement.        there are several reasons for
involvement, which underline IDA's strategy for enhancing human capital
development in India through high return investments. They also go along with
our emerging objective of assisting India in controlling major health problems,
while simultaneously improving the quality, effectiveness and efficiency of
health systems in a sustainable manner. First, the country is witnessing the
emergence of an epidemic whose potential negative consequences are enormous if
left unrestrained. In this context, it is necessary to assist the Government in
reducing the risks of jeopardizing and reversing health improvements.   The
detrimental impact on maternal and child health would be especially significant.
Second, the level of assistance required to respond to the epidemic cannot be
fulfilled by other donors. Finally, there are high direct and indirect economic
returns to the proposed investments.
9.        Prolect Obiectives and Stratemy.  The ultimate aim of the project
would be to slow the spread of HIV in India to reduce future morbidity,
mortality, and the impact of AIDS. It is clear that measures must be taken as
a matter of high priority to begin dealing with HIV/AIDS in a more comprehensive
manner. Thus, the project would be a "start-up investment". It would take a
multi-pronged approach that would focus on the most critical interventions to
begin limiting HIV transmission today.  It would also set a basis for more
extensive HIV/AIDS control activities in the future. The project would take



account of available scientific information and the lessons of experience from
AIDS efforts worldwide (par*. 6). Project activities would be integrated to the
maximum extent with the existing health infrastructure; they would also make
extensive use of the private sector and NGOs in areas in which they have
comparative advantage.    The scope of the project would vary with each
intervention according to need, absorptive capacity, feasibility and efficiency.
10.       ?roiegt Descriotio.   The project would provide, over five years,
training and workshops; publicity services; health information and education
materials- consultant services; NCO services; laboratory, blood banking and
medical equipment and supplies; surveys and operational studies; STD medicines;
vehicles; civil works; incremental salaries for additional staff; and operation
and maintenance of equipment and vehicles. The Union Government would coordinate
the project, carry out major procurement and logistics, implement some public
awareness activities and develop policy and technical guidelines. The States and
UTs would implement most project activities. 001 would pass to the States and
UTs the goods procured and would bear all project costs borne by the States and
UTs.
11.       The project components consist of: (a) Dromotiug public awareness and
*gg=Mij L      cgrt. with a primary focus on sexual transmission, behavioral change
and condom promotion through the television and radio stations, private
advertising agencies, NGOs and the health system; (b) imnroving blood safety from
a current 30 percent to 90 percent of the blood supply, and enhancing the
rational use of blood and the share of voluntary donations;  (c) building
surveillance and clinical mana=ement capacity to monitor the spread of the
epidemic and to strengthen the skills of health staff and social workers in
managing and counselling HIV/AIDS persons; (d) c9=rg1j.ing sexually transmitted
diseases by improving clinical services and case management in the country's STD
clinics and in private practice in metropolitan areas; and (e) strengtheing the
ManM Mten  capacity for HIV/AIDS control through the formation and support of
national and State AIDS Control Cells.
12.       Project Costa. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$99.6
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$34.1 million (34%)
and taxes estimated at about US$3.6 million equivalent.   IDA would finance
US$84.0 million equivalent, or about 87.5% of the net of tax cost of the project.
The World Health Organization (WHO) would provide the equivalent of US$1.5
million in international technical assistance as parallel grant financing. GOI
would finance the remaining US$14.1 million equivalent, or 14.1% of the total
project cost. A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Retroactive financing of up to US$3.0 million would be provided for
eligible expenditures made after October 31, 1991.  Amounts and methods of
procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable
of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Ind,a
are presented in Schedules C and D. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 10165-IN,
dated March 9, 1992, is being distributed separately.

13.       Prolece Sustainabilitv.   The project's interventions are largely
preventive and the recurrent costs they generate would be a negligible part of
Union and State expenditures on health at this time. Nonetheless, project-
assisted activities would need to be sustained and to grow for some time within
serious budgetary constraints. The project constitutes an integral core of GOI's
plan to combat AIDS and the Government's commitment to this objective is
prominent. A more significant and consequential issue is the cost of dealing
with AIDS patients, which will escalate progressively during the decade and
beyond. In this context, the Bank and MOHFW have iritiated a collaborative study
on health financing. This review will help identify gaps in the financJi of
sectoral interventions and how they can be effectively and efficiently met. In
addition, a plan for the next phase of AIDS Control activities to be developed
in the proposed project would further address the sustainability of national AIDS
control efforts.
14.       Arneed Actions.    During negotiations,  the  Government  provided
assurances that it would: (a) establish by October 31, 1992 and then maintain a
Technical Advisory Sub-Committee or Social, Ethical and Legal Issues, according
to terms of reference satisfactory to IDA; (b) cause project States and UTs by
dates agreed with IDA to establish and maintain AIDS Control Cells in their
respective Departments of Health; (c) develop under terms of reference
satisfactory to IDA by June 30, 1995, a strategic plan for the next phase of the
Government's program for HIV/AIDS control; (d) select NGOs on the basis of
criteria and procedures satisfactory to IDA; (e) promulgate by September 30, 1992
and thereafter maintain and enforce regulations requiring that condoms
manufactured or sold in India conform to quality standards established by WHO;
(f) review annual progress and plans with IDA; and (g) carry out with IDA a mid-
term review of project implementation prior to March 1995 and take into account
comments and suggestions made by IDA during implementation thereafter.
15.       There would be two conditions of effectiveness: (a) the Government
shall establish and thereafter maintain a National AIDS Control Authority, with
adequate full-time staff, other resources and terms of reference satisfactory to
IDA, and the designated staff shall have commenced work; and (b) all conditions
precedent to the effectiveness of the WHO Grant would have been fulfilled. A
condition of disbursement for expenditures incurred by any State or UT would be
that the Government furnish IDA with a Letter of Undertaking satisfactory to IDA
from that State or UT which would outline how each State/UT would carry out its
part of the project.
16.       Project Benefits.  The project's interventions would help slow the
spread of the HIV epidemic and its burden on individuals, families, and the
society. The project would contribute to preserving health status and previous
investments in health. The project would have a significantly high return in
terms of healthy life years saved. Externalities would be high and the project
benefits would accrue to the society at large. HIV control would contribute to
the containment of tuberculosis which is exacerbated by AIDS. Most importantly,
responding to AIDS now would cost only a fraction of what would be required at
a later stage when the disease is allowed to become more widespread.



-5-
17.       It is estimated that at least 300,000 AIDS cases would be avoided on
account of the project by the year 2000. It has been estimated that the project
would help avoid about US$388 million of direct bhalth care costs to the Union
and State Governments between 1994 and 2000. An indicative economic rate of
return, illustrating the comparison between direct cost to the Government that
could be saved and the total investment, is estimated to be about 27 percent.
In addition, the project would, by the year 2000, help avoid a loss to the
national income ranging from US$2.5 billion to US$3 billion equivalent. Hence
direct and indirect returns would be significant.
18.       Pro-gram Obective  Categories:    Poverty Agggcts.   By  enhancing
prevention, the project would limit the shifting of health resources to
additional curative care often consumed by the middle and upper socio-economic
classes. Poor segments of the population such as migrant labor and commercial
sex workers are at high risk of HIV infection and they would be targeted by the
projer,t. Also, the project would slow the rise in the number of orphans. VID
Aspects. The project would conitribute to alleviating the number of infections
transmitted to women and would help mitigate STDs which are responsible for
considerable morbidity in women's reproductive health and long-term complications
like pelvic inflammatory disease and neonatal infections. In addition, enacting
higher standards for condom quality would benefit not only HIV/STD prevention but
also family planning programs.   Private Sector Aspects.   The project would
support the role of the private sector and NGOs in HIV/AIDS prevention and
general care activities.
19.       Iska.  There are several risks to the project.  First, preventing
AIDS depends largely on changes in people's behavior. There is no quick solution
for achieving these changes. This would be addressed by making the project well
focused on key actions in a multi-pronged approach, by using NGOs to reach risk
behavior groups arA by extensive participation of the television and radio
stations and the private sector in promoting public awareness.
20.       Second, there are the usual risks of poor implementation of project
investments by a Borrower whose implementation record is mixed. These would be
addressed by the careful preparation of the project in those areas that have
constrained previous social sector projects in India, by paying special attention
to project management and implementation responsibilities, and by making good use
during implementation of WHO resident technical assistance.
21.      Rtegoenadation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
