INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMNDA∂TION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO TIE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT T1 THE REPUBLIC OF HONDURAS
FOR A SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVEIDPMNT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Honduras for the equivalent of US$6.6
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for livestock de-
velopment. The proceeds of the credit would be relent to the Central Bank
of Honduras for 20 years including 10 years of grace with interest at
two percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Recent Developments and Prospects
2.        A report entitled "Basic Report on the Economy of Honduras"
(CA-19a) was distributed to the Executive Directors in June 1972 (R72-190).
The main recommendations of this report stress the importance of policies
to diversify the economy, especially through Government action to encourage
forestry, the necessity of negotiating a reasonable basis for renewed full
participation of Honduras in the Central American Common Market (CACM), and
the desirability of increasing tax revenues. A mission to update economic
infonmation visited Honduras in August 1973. Its findings are reflected
in this summary; an Updating Economic Report is scheduled for distribution
to the Executive Directors late this year. A country data sheet is attached
as Annex I.
3.        Honduras has a small open economy, heavily dependent on the export
of bananas, although a modest degree of diversification has taken place in
the last decade through the development of new export products such as meat,
simple manufactures, cotton and tobacco. Its limited resources consist
mainly of the fertile coastal plain in the north, a few fertile valleys in
the east, and extensive but largely unexploited natural pine forests. Known
mineral deposits are not extensive; they include silver, lead and zinc, which
have been exploited on a small scale for decades, and low-grade iron ore.
Although the average population-to-land ratio is favorable, population has
traditionally concentrated in the mountainous west, the poorest agricultural
area of the country, and on the north coastal plain. In the future, as
population pressure increases in these areas, heavy investment in physical
infrastructure will be necessary to facilitate the movement of population to
less heavily settled areas further to the east.   This process has already
started as the road network was improved and expanded in recent years.
4.        With per capita income of about US$290 in 1971,- Honduras is the
poorest country in Central America. Real GDP rose at an average annual rate
1/ Calculated according to World Bank Atlas methodology.



-of !.7 percent during 1965-72, but much of this expansion took place
during the first three years of this period, as a consequence of
substantial irvestment and large increases in output and export of
bananas. From 1969 through 1972 economic gro-wth has been quite low,real
per capita income growing at a yearly rate of 1.2 percent.  Inflation has
been limited: the consumer price index rose at a rate of 2.1 percent per
year from l965 to 1972. Several factors contributed to the slow growth of the
economy during the Last few years, including severe hurricane damage to banana
and other crops in 1969,coinciding with the armed conflict between Hondurns
and El Salvador and the consequent reduction in private investment and the
withdrawal by Honduras from the..free trade arrangements of the Central
American Common Market (CACM), a move which adversely affected a number
of export industries. Widespread drought in 1972, and storms and floods
in the banana plantations in 1973 have resulted in a large loss in agricul-
tural production. By mid-1973, however, there were signs that the economy
was pulling out of this period of relative stagnation. Export prices were
improving and the Gove-rnment's budgetary position was stronger.  Following
the severe deterioration in the balance-of-payments in 1969-70, the
net international reserves' position improved during 1971-72, a move which
will probably be continued in 1973. The rate of inflation in 1973 will,
however, be above the historical rate and may be of the order of 5 percent,
both '-because of the production problems in the agricultural sector and
because of higher import prices.
5.        The CACM was an important element in the growth of the Honduran
economy during the 1960's. The CACM absorbed Honduran exports of staples
which have no ready market elsewhere, and it provided the additional markets
necessary for the establishment of factories making textiles, clothing,
chemicals and meta.l products.  The Honduran authorities felt, however, that
the benefits of integration, especially in terms of industrial investment,
were unequally distributed among the member countries. The other CACM
members recognize the basis for the Honduran complaints, and during the past
two years have sought solutions to the problem. As an interim solution to
basic Common Market problems, Honduras has negotiated bilateral trade agree-
ments with all its CACM partners except El Salvador. In the meantime, the
Common Market Secretariat (SIECA) has prepared a study which proposes solu-
tions to existing problems, and makes recommendations geared to the formation
of a Central American Economic Comrmnity. The report has been well received
by the CACM member governments, including Honduras.  Once a political settlement
is reached between Honduras and El Salvador -- which the two governments have
indicated they expect to reach in early 1974 -- there should be more rapid
progress toward integration objectives.
6.        During most of the 1960's the Government sharply increased its
investment in development projects.  Among the major achievements in this
period were the establishment of a basic transport network connecting the
main population centers, the expansion of electric power and telecommuni-
cations services, and the doubling of primary school enrollment. Until
1968, there were no financial difficulties in carrying forward these schemes,
mainly because of the fast growth of goverrnment revenues based on the intro-
duction of a general sales tax and higher income tax rates in 1964, and larger
tax paeyments by the banana companies.  After 1969, however, the public sector



-3 -
experienced a sharp deterioration in its finances, initially because of
defense and other emergency expenditures connected with the 1969 conflict
with El Salvador, and later because the normal growth of Government
current expenditures outstripped the current revenues. Public sector
savings declined from an average of 2.7 percent of GDP in 1966-68 to 1.6
percent of GDP in 1969-71. In-spite of this, the public sector mainteined
an impressive investment effort with the average investment ratio rising from
3.6 to 6.2 percent of GDP over the same period. A large increase in net
foreign fin.ancing did not cover the overall public sector deficit, and the
Centr8l Bank was required to finance the gap, equivalent to about 1.3 percent
of GDP in 1969-71. In 1972 the Central Government was able to improve its
financial position, but this was in large part the result of a 20 percent
drop in investment expenditures. In the first half of 1973, the Government's
financial position continued to improve, but this year it was the result of
an increase in current revenues and tight control over current expenditures.
Investment expenditures, although not being further reduced, continued at
relatively low levels in the first half of 1973. This low level in both
1972 and early 1973 results from the small number of new project starts in
the preceding years.   One of the Government's major concerns at present is
building up a new pipeline of sound development projects responsive to the
country's development objectives.
7.        The military Government that took power in December 1972  announced
its intention to pursue progressive development policies, and to tackle the
country's fundamental economic and social problems. The new Government's
development plan -- mainly a definition of objectives and policies rather
than specific projects -- is expected to be ready in December 1973. Pending
its completion, the new Government has been working closely with international
agencies in an effort to revise and accelerate the execution of a tentative
investment program prepared last year. The program provides for continued
investments in physical infrastructure, especially power and transport, and
a substantial increase of investment in the social sectors, particularly
education and water supply and in directly productive sectors, giving special
emphasis to agricultural diversification. The forestry sector offers the
best opportunity for the medium-term diversification of production with
good export potential. Since the first of the year, the Government has taken
a number of important actions, among them the enactment of agrarian reform
measures designed to resolve emergency land tenure problems while a long-term
agrarian plan is designed, the formation of the long-awaited skilled labor
training center and steps towards the development of forest-based industries.
The new Government has indicated that it intends to introduce any necessary
tax measures when the financing needs of the revised development and public
investment plans are fully established.
8.        Over the next five years or so, the economy is expected to recover
from its recent stagnation. Banana exports, which still constitute slightly
more than 4O percent of Honduras' total exports, will grow only moderately,
but this is expected to be more than offset by rapidly rising exports of coffee,
meat, timber and cotton. Total export growth may be of the order of 8 percent



per year, thus strengthening Honduras' balance-of-payments and contributing
to a faster rate of growth of GDP. The more intensive development effort
expected in the public sector, along with the renewed private sector expansion
(stimulated by Government activities, favorable export markets and the expected
re-establishment of regional integration arrangements) will add to both import
demand and development financing requirements.   Thus in the medium-term the
favorable prospects also mean an increased need for external assistance.
External Assistance
9.        The external lending agencies have strongly supported public invest-
ment in Honduras. Outstanding external public debt, including undisbursed,
amounted to US$252.4 million as of December 1972.   Of this total, more than
32 percent is repayable in local currency, and the ratio of debt service
payable in foreign exchange to export earnings is very low - 3.4 percent.
Excluding the large proportion of the external debt repayable in local
currency, the Bank's share of external debt - including undisbursed - is
3h.3 percent and the IDA's share is 14.6 percent. During 1972, the percen-
tage of Bank Group debt Eervice in total debt service repayable in foreign
currency was about 50 percent.
10.       Apart from the Bank Group, external financing is provided by USAID,
the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Central American Bank for
Economic Integration (CABEI).   USAID has been active in education, health,
feeder road construction, water supply and agriculture; it was also instru-
mental in the formation of a private industrial finance company. IDB has
been involved in housing, education, water and sewerage, and highways. It
also supports agricultural and industrial projects by means of general credit
lines to the government-owned development bank. CABEI is financing projects
with a regional impact, primarily in transport, industry and telecommunica-
tions. Past lending of these agencies is summarized below.

-5-
IDB and CABEI are expected to continue financing projects in the sectors
which they have financed in the past, although CABEI will focus increasingly
on tourism. USAID, on the other hand, may concentrate its future lending in
agriculture, depending on the results of an ongoing sector survey which it
is financing.
11.       Since its poverty, meager resource endownent and balance-of-payments
performance have made it difficult for Honduras - one of the least developed
countries in Latin America - to borrow substantial amounts ozW conventional
terms, external agencies have extended financial assistance on fairly soft
terms so that debt service, while it has risen significantly in the last few
years, is still low. Honduras does have some margin for borrowing on con-
ventional terms; assuming that the average terms of external borrowing were
to remain more or less the same as in the past, the debt service ratio would
rise to about 6.5 percent by the end of the decade, which is manageable for the
Honduran economy. However, in view of Honduras' poverty, it is Hesirable
to maintain reasonably soft average terms of assistance in the future in order
to limit the burden of debt service upon both the budget and the balance-of-
payments; further IDA credits are accordingly being planned.
PART II  - BANK GROTJP OPERATIONS IN HONDURAS
12.       Honduras has to date received twelve Bank loans totalling $89.2
million and five IDA credits totalling $24.0 million, both net of cancel-
lations, making a total of $113.2 million.   At the end of July 1973, the
Bank and IDA held about $100.1 million, including about $39.1 million not
yet disbursed. The most recent loan, for highways, was signed in May 1973.
13.       Execution of Bank Group financed projects has, on the whole, been
satisfactory.  Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA
credits and IFC investments as of -July 31, 1973, and notes on the execu-
tion of on-going projects.
14.       In the past, Bank and IDA lending has been heavily concentrated on
transport and power, where inadequate facilities hampered the development of
the country. The first livestock development credit approved in 1970, how-
ever, marked a first step towards diversifying lending. The BankTs lending
program for FY73-77 would support the priorities of the Governmentts invest-
ment plan by giving increased emphasis to investment in the social and
directly productive sectors while continuing to lend for physical infrastruc-
uLre, where there are still substartial deficiencies to be overcome.
15.       Over the past two years the Bank has been working with the Govern-
ment in developing programs in agriculture.    The objectives of lending for



agr.culture c.re to assist in diversifying the econory, developing competi-
t-i-ve exports in high-value products, and. supoortbing the Governnenrt's efforts
in agrarian reform. The proposed project-, along -ith c'her projects under

16.       Thie Bank Group and the C-overrnient have also been working in the
f'ield olf education. The firs-t edhcation  rocject, scheduled to be presented
for your consideration in the next few months. -, includis ncn-formal technical
training, agricultural education, and teacher training 7rograms, which are

the  highway links bet-,pween the main regions of the co-untry, but would. in the
future place greater erphasis on assistance in the construction of a network
of feeder and access roads to suDport the Cooverrnent's agricultur-l progranm.
18.       We plan to assist industr-y in Hornduras as -well as in the other
Central Ar.erican countries by lending to the Central American Bank fcr Ec-
notic Integration (CA3EI). Lending for indu)stry through a multinational
institut ion such as CABEI would support -,he Crentral American integration
effort; foster rational indu.strialization in the cxea where national market s

20.       1.^riculture constitutes the largest single sector in Honduras'
economy. R,:T     35 percent of GD' is der-i:ved from the sector, arnd agri-

- 7   -
21.       Bananas, grown primarily by two U.S. companies, are the most
important crop, representing 42 percent of export earnings and 26 percent
of agricultural value added.  The banana industry has largely determined the per-
formance of the agricultural sector, and has traditionally been the source
of growth cf the econcmy. Coffee, timber and meat are the other major
exports, although cotton, tobacco, sugarcane, maize and beans are also ex-
Dorted. The steady increases that have taken place in manv of these other
exDortable commodities are expected within the next few years to lessen the
impact of variations in banana output on total exports.
22.       Agricultural production is concentrated in the west and north
coastal plains, which represent less than 40 percent of the land which could
be used for agriculture. Snall holdings are generally located in the moun-
tainous areas where poor soils prevail, while many of the larger farms are
located in the fertile lowlands. Land presently under cultivation is unevenly
distributed_ with two-thirds of all farms in holdings of less than 8 ha, although
few farms are large by Central American standards.  Income distribution, however,
is skewed between the urban and rural population. Per capita income in the rural
areas is nalf the national average. If earnings of labor working in the banana
industry are excluded, average per capita income in the rural sector is even
lower - averaging US$50-13S$6O per year.
Agricultural Development Strategy
23.       The Goverrnent recognizes that agriculture will continue to be
the main source of employment and growth for same time, and has been trying
to devise a strategy which will bring abo-ut improvement in the living con-
ditions of the rural population while at the same time encouraging diversi-
fication of the country's exports. The agricultural development policies,
some of which are still being elaborated, will constitute a central part Of
the five-year development plan due to be completed later this year.
2a.       In the past, there was no effective policy of land tenure
reform; in the early sixties an agrarian reform law was passed and the
National Agrarian Institute (NAI) established to execute the law. The law,
however, was never fully implemented. Partly as a result of the Government's
inability to handle the issue of land reform, rural unrest increased in the
late sixties with the faxrmers, who are organized in trade unions, demanding
government action. Shortly after coming into office, the new Government
issued a decree designed to solve short-term tenure problems. The decree
empowered the National Agrarian Institute to allocate national and muni-
cipal land to the rural poor, and to rent for nominal payments privately
owned lands which are not being farmed.   The decree is also designed to
protect farmers who are genuinely developing land productively.  The emer-
gency program is now underway, and 7,500 families have already been settled
on about 30,000 hectares. The Government is now designing long-term coloni-
zation and land redistribution programs, but is giving special emphasis to the
former since much of the rich eastern frontier of Honduras remains uninhabited
and unexploited. A multipurpose cadaster which the Government has begun should
assist in orienting these agrarian programs. The Government has requested
Bank assistance in the formulation and implementation of its land colonization



and distribution programs, and we hope to provide assistance in this field.
25.       The Government is also placing special emphasis on forestry develop-
ment: it is promoting several projects to export wood and wood-based products,
and has requested IDB assistance to organize a forest administration system.
Tn the field of agricultural services, the Government is strengthening the
agricultural extension service with the assistance of IDB.
Agricultural Services
26.       The departments in Government dealing with agriculture are not well
developed and suffer from a lack of professional staff, poor long-range plan-
ning, and a shortage of funds. Extension serviceE to farmers are provided
by Desarrollo Rural (DESAORURAL), a semi-autonomous agency under the Ministry
of Natural Resources, which works in close cooperation with the National
Developuent Bank and NAI, and is one of the more effective public agencies.
But the agency, primarily conmitted to service the needs of the large number
of small subsistence farmers and the organizations that represent them, is
short of staff. A technical unit was created within the Central Bank to
administer the First Livestock Project because it was felt that DESARRURAL
was overburdened and could not assume additional tasks. This unit has proved
to be efl'ective, and will be expanded in the second project.    Agricul-
tural research Tacilities are almostY fion-exis-tent-: t'-he' Government station
at Comayagua distributes cattle rather than conducts applied research,
and the banana companies keep the resul-t of their eetuensive research Drograms
for their own use.
Agricultural Credit
27.       Honduras has a well developed and competitive banking system
consisting of the Central Bank (CB), ten private commercial banks and seven
specialized institutions, including the government-owned National Develop-
ment Bank (INDB). NDB was created in 1950 with the purpose of financing
and developing a wide range of agricultural schemes.    The NDB did not
participate in the First Livestock Development Project largely because its
administration was weak, its technicians fully extended, and its debt col-
lection poor. Since then, however, the institution has improved considerably,
and detailed studies by both USAID and IDB have commented favorably on its
revamped administration and supporting services.   Improvements in NDB qualify
it for participation in the second project. NDB would provide useful compe-
tition to commiercial banks, and  since it represents the largest single channel
of agricultural lending, may well be an appropriate organization to handle
further Bank Group projects in agriculture.   A second specialized institution
is the Autonomous Municipal Bank (AMB), owned by municipalities and the Govern-
ment, and designed to help finance municipal projects such as slaughterhouses.
AMB is poorly managed and financially weak, partly because many municipali-
ties are not financially independent, and have been reluctant to contribute
funds to the bank.  AMB does not enjoy the confidence of the municipalities
or the Government, and is currently being reorganized with USAID assistance,
but it will take at least two years before it is operational again. There-
fore, it will not participate in this project.

28.       Agriculturel credit is prov ided by both public and private banks,
and is mostly short-tennr. Recently, the private banks have provided some
.ong-term. credit although most of it is provided by public banks with cre-
dits from interTnational finance institutions. NDB has been the main source
o^' credit to the agricultural sector,having made about 60 percent of all
loans to agriculture.  The very small farmer is being assisted by a line of
credit from IDB which is being disbursed through the NDB and credit cooperatives.
Although total loans to the agricultural sector doubled between 1968 and 1972,
much of the increase was short-term credit. There remains a need for long-term
credit with appropriate grace periods.
The Tivestock Sub-Sector
29.       The cattle industry is raDidly increasing in importance, and the
potential for developnent is considerable.  Official estimates indicate a
national cattle herd of 1.6 million head. Cattle   are widely distributed
throughout the country, but 58 percent of all cattle are said to be on smé.ll
farms of less than 65 ha. Most of the ca:-tle are of the native ty-e and;
tuhough stuunted by poor nutrition and bad management, are capable -f greater
productivity than is currently achieved. There is very little specialized
dairy farming. Most of the milk for human consumption comes from predumi-
nantly beef type animals.  Cattle husbandry standards are extremely low.
The first livestock project has helped to improve this situation, and the
proposed second project aims to further assist by providing specialist
advisors in the fields of farm management, pasture management, and cattle
and pig husbandry.
30.       Beef production has increased steadily from 15,h00 tons in 1900
uo 38,000 tons in 1971. During this period, exports have risen nearly ten-
fold, from 2,400 tons to 22,130 tons, but dcmestic consumption of carcass
meat has remained static at about 16,000 tons per year, Much oD the beef
produced is exported, mostly as boneless beef to the United States. Milk
production has risen at a more modest rate, fram 128 million liters in 1960
to 153 million liters in 1971. Output has not been able to keep up with
ising demand and imports have risen correspondingly fro   12 million liters
to 33 million liters of liquid milk equivalent in the same period.
31.       The total pig population is estimated to be 720,000 head, scat-
tered mainly among the large number of small subsistence farmers. Special-
ized pig production barely exists; few producers own more than five sows,
and standards of husbandry are extremely low. Poor nutrition is the primary
problem, leading to hign mortality and low productivity.
Marketing
32.       The export meat trade is in the hands of seven export packing
plants which are run aggressively, and more are being established. At
present, average producer prices paid by the packers provide adequate incen-
tives for the producer.  Regulations prohibit the packers from including
more than 10 percent of females in the animals they slaughter "or export,



^hich has the effect of channeling most of the cull female stock to the
doxrest c mark<et. Most animals for domest/ic consumption are killed 'oy local
butchers, in -mrlnicipal abattoirs, or elsewhere illegally.  Most of these
abatto-rs are pocrly equipped and mnhy-iernic.  Al1 Dig production is
slaughtered privately or in the munic-ipal abattoirs within the country.  Tne
export nackers do not handle pigs, since, for hygienic reasons, United States
imDort regraiations do not perm.it them to slaughter 4igs with the samne equip-
ment that is used to slaughter cattle.    The proposed prolect i-ncludes
fimancing of five mu-nicipal abattoirs to assist in improving the marketing
facili,ie-s for locally consumrred livestock prodic-ts.
33.       Milk consumption in liquid form is estirated to be 25 percert of
total product-ion, the balance being tised to make cheese and butter. Most
liquid milk is consumed in the heerily populat?d departments and those with
milk processing plants. These plants are either individually ovmed or
owned 'y producer cooperativens.
First Livestock Project@
34.       The Association became involved in the development of the livestoek;
sub-sector in 1970 when it made a U,S$2.6 million credit to help finence
medium and. long-term Loans to farmers for bee'. and dairy enterpri ses, and
funds for technical assistance. The project was carried out by tne Central
Bank, w'hich channelled funds to farmers tarough the co=iercial banking system.
The project has been wTell receivred by local farmers, who viewed it- not only
as a mneans of obtaining scarce long-term financing they required, but also
as a means for inproving their production techniques. Proj,ect staff have
performed wvell, and the ?resident of the Central Bank has given the project
his personal support. As a result of the project, the commercial banking
system has for the first time become a source of supervised long-term
credit.  Despite delays caused by rural unrest in late 1'971 and early 1972,
alrl funds were committed on schedule bv 3March 1973, and JDA has. disbursedwt
UJS$1.5 milior.
37.         lr-ig t}he first two years, the average size 5of suh-loans in the
first project was about- US$40,000, but this average has -fnallen sharply
during 1973. Darlier loans were made mostly to larger farMers, a de-mand
now- largely satisfied, and henceforth medium and smaller producerz are
likely to predominate in the project.  The impact of the first project on the
4azrmers, and to some extent on the banking corunity, has been considerable,
and a found.at-ion has been laid for a fa-r reaching progrwa of supervised
develoDment credit for the entire livestock industry. q'ne proposed eecond
lvestock development project wvould build on thne nomentum genera-ted by the
f.rst, project.

presented by Messrs. Manuel Acosta Bonilla, Minister of Finance and Public
Credit, Roberto Galvez, Anbassador of Honduras to the United States,and
Gaillermo Bueso, Economic Advisor to the Honduran Embassy.   The Central Bank
was represented by Messrs. Alberto Galeano, President, Porfirio Zavala,
Manager, Adalberto Discua, Lawyer and Mario Nueio, Project Director.
Project Description
37.       The project, which meets the objectives of the Government's agri-
cultural development program, would be an extension and enlargement of the
First Livestock Developnent Project. Its purpose is to make funds available
for the expansion of the cattle and pig industries, including credit to far-
mers, financing of municipal slaughterhouses and technical assistance. The
project is designed to assist an increasing number of smaller livestock Froducers.
Emphasis will therefore be placed in areas where ecological conditions permit the
development of intensive dairying at relatively low capital cost. Such
conditions are to be found primarily in the Atlantic zone, where t.he dis-
tribution of rainfall and soil conditions enable high returns from c small
acreage. Where natural conditions are not so favorable, the emphasis needs
to be on beef production, which is not financially viable in very small
units. Under Honduran conditions,analysis indicates a breeding/fattening farm
would have an average size of about l50 ha. while Lor breeding alone hoo ha.
is about the average. The proposed project allocates resources about equally
between dairy and beef development.
38.       The project consists of:
(1)  Financing of on-farm investments for pasture development,
fencing, watering points, 'breeding stock, and stock hand-
ling facilities for approximately 730 cattle farms of live
different types:
(a)  100  small dairy farms with an average size of 30 has.
(b)  200 medium dairy farms with an average size of 50 has.
(c)  200 beef breeding/fattening farms with an average size
of 150 has.
(d) 200 beef breeding farms with an average size of 400 has.
(e)  30 small pig units, each with about 25 sows.
The average size of loans to farmers would be about $10,000
equivalent,of which IDDA's contribution  would be about $7,700
equivalent.
(2)  Construction of th'ee small manicipal abattoirs, one medium
size municipal abattoir in San Pedro Sula, and the improve-
is.nt of one larGe municioal abattoir in Teeuciga'op.



-12 -
(3) Provision of four specialist livesteock ndv%risors to assist
farners and the livestock zec]Ωn iciPE enrio-yed by, the _
P,artici2at,,ing banks, and train:ng facilities for pro.ject staff.
39.       ThEecution of the pro,ect is expected to -;`Pke five years, sub-loan
comnitrents are expected teo take three years ard completion of disbursements
five years .
Lo.       .>o -.ssist in the impe-nentat`on of the project, the Govenm-ent has
undiertaken ,o a~ct in two areas.  First, the GovarnTnert wvould provide suita-
bly qualified personnel tc supervise municipal aba:teirs so that only whole-
some meat is used for human cons-unption, anc would ensure tnat municiLpalities
will actvely ta-ke steps to prevent non-inspected meat from reaching t'ne do-
mestic market. Secondly, the Govermmant has underta)ken to maintain polic-es
with respect tc prices, quotas etc. in the livestock sector w.hich would
po-vide acequate incentives to =Lvestock nroducers tc exomand. production.
Cost Estimates and Frin  i-ng
uLl.      The total cost of the Drcject is eesimated at W~1.0 million.   A
detailed break-down of costs is given in lnrnex IlL. On-f4a= development,
the largest component of the project. represents 84' percent, of total project
costs, abai-tto-ir construction 10 percent and technical assistance 6 percent.
The proposed credit of $6.6 million represents 60 percent of total project
costs, anc.il finance all foreign exchange E-pend-tures amounti7ng to $!h.?
million (11 percent of total project cost)7, Tlrs $021 million in local cur-
rency expDendit-'ures.  Local currancy f:inaEznciung is justified on the grounds
that, in spite of i-s efforts to mcbilize local resoces for develojAnent,
ti;he Goverrrment must still rely upon extqenal finamcirg in excess o' trhe
foreign exch-arge component of i3ndividual projects to carry forard anr ef-
fective develop-ment program.  Tne participating baenks -would con'-ribute 18
percent of' tot.al project costs, the eub-borrowers tfermors or mnnioipalities'

Organization
11?.       'he Central Ba:nk would act- as administering agent for the pro.ject
and would be responEible for channelling funds for on-farm devreloprient to
partic ipat:'ng bnanks w1ho wTould on-lend tD f:'arxmers.  For abattoir develepment
the Central Bank would lend directly to mun,icipal-;itiez, a practice which
nas been follo-w-ed in the recent past, because the Autonormous Municipal
Bank, the main craanrel forn lending to muln:cipalities, is oenzg reorganized.
TIe Central 3ank is technically capable of carrying out the pro-oned direct
lending operation.  Coordinating and supe3nrvisory fuInctions would remain
with the Project Comrmission, created by t'ie Governnent to supervise the
first. L-  tocAk vDevelopment Project.  The Co5missior formulates policies
and proced-ureEs and i s composed of representatives from- variolu,s CGovernment
a;gencies, -u-r7;icir.no banks and the National Cattlemen's Asscciation.

banks - expected to 0e sevneral of the large private banks and the National
Development Bank - would employ lirestock technicians, whose function would
be to assist farmers in the preparation and implerentation of farm develop-
ment plans. Such technicians would answer administratively to their respec-
tive banks, but would be under the technicaL supervision of the Project
Director.
Lending Arrangements
44.       The Central Bank would rece i:e IDA funds from the Goverrment at
2 percent.  The Governuent would bear the exchange risk,  For on-farm
development, the Central Bank would lend to the participating banks
at an interest rate of 5 percent. The participating ba:ks would on-lend
to farmer clients at 9 percent; this rate is in line with the prevailing
interest rate for agriculture in Honduras. For investments in abattoirs,
the Central Bank will lend to muncipalities at the prevailing rate of
9 percent. The spreads allowed to the Central Bank wiould cover the
administrative costs of the project including technical assistance which
is e.Vected to increase  substantially over the first oroject, because of
the greater emphasis on assisting small farmers. Any surplus income would
revert to the project account for further lending in livestock. The 4
percent allowed to participating banks would be adequate to cover
administrative costs (including the employment of livestock technicians)
and loan risk, and leave a reasonable profit.
45.       The Government would on-lend to the Central Bank for 20 years in-
eluding 10 years grace. The Central Bank would on-lend to participating barLks
for 8 to 12 years including 2 to 5 years grace, which are the same terms at
which the participatirg banks will lend to farners. The Central Bank will
lend to muncipalities -for 10 to 12 years, including up to 2 years grace.
L6.        The proposed financing and landing arrangemrent tends to favor those
participants with total borrowing requirements not exceeding US 9,00C)
equivalent. Sub-borrowers in this category would provide 10 percent of the
proposed investment, with the participating bank providing 9 percent and the
Central Bank (from IDA funds) 81 percent.  Participants with larger borrowing
requirements would contribute 20 percent of total investment. with the
participating bank providing 20 percent and the Centrnl Bank (from I3A fiinds)
60 percent.  The municipalities would contribute 20 percent of total investment,
with the Central Bank providing 20 percent out of its own funds and 60 percent
from IDA funds.



Procureime nt
47,       Procurement- for Lana develoiment items through international com-
petitive bidding would not be appropriate, because of the diversity of ittems,
snal size of individual purchases and need for free choice by the indivi-
dual borrowers. Accordingly, local conmaercial channels would be used. Hon-
duras has a good network of dealers in agricultural machinery and farm inputs,
and facilities for maintenance and servicing are adequate. Purchases of
breeding stock wouLd be subject tc the aporoval of the Project Director, and
since the type and quality of animals reqTired must> be obtained frarn s-pecifi,c
regionm of the worlds which are free froya foot and moWuh desease, interna-
tional corae`itive bidding wo-ud not be a-opropriate for livestock procare-
me nt.
L8.       urouping o7 o-rders for th-?e abattoirs woulld aLso be impractical
because they are widely dispersed tnroughout the country and tcheir size,
capacities and tirming of construction vary. r'he constr.uction of one abJt-
toir alone would not attract international bidding. Therefore, for the
three sirtall abattoirs, each costing abo-ut $L45,000, it lenst, three
bids would be sought before awarding a contract for either civil works or
for equipnent. For the larger abattoirs in San Pedro Sula and TeEiicigalpa,
international ccmpetitive bidding is not expected -to lead to a wide res-
ponse because of the relatively small amoants involved ($34&5,OCO and
4557,00 respec6tivevy)  the idpracticability of grouping contracts
for both abattoirs and the specialized nature of abattoir equ:i eaent. Tenders
would therefore be pablished locally, and submitted to known interrn-ational
suppliers.  All official representatives in honduras of countries 1kely
to be interested will also be notified.
Disbursements
The cridit would be disbursed against 75 nereent of loans for
livestock develo:menrt on medii-m and 'larger farms and for the municipal abat-
toirs; 90 percent of loans for livestock development o0-n small :'ar,s ; and
100 percent of foreigna expenditureo for services of livestock advisors.
and training of project staff. A schedule cI' estimat ed disburskroea:ts is
included in Annex III.
Benefits
50.       The econmiic returns of the project. are est-Lrnated at 18 percent
for the on-fann investments and 24 percent for abatto-i4-s. The project would
lead to improved husbandry practicesj a 'Larger national cattle hnero., higer
productivity) and intensification oZ -and use. At full 6develo;r.ent! the pro-
jectTs incremental annual production of livestock products would incJ:u
22,100 tono of rn-Llk, 3,8)50 tons of beef (a 10 percent increase in the country's
Uotal - .Jrction), and 635 tons of -pork. In addition, the cattle breeding
farms wolcid .roduce aocut 6,000 hei;ers, wuhich would be retained or sold to
replace cull cows. TIcΩluded in the benefits are incremental returns to tthie
Governmme>,Th IFrcm taxes and fees, which at full development would amount to
approximately $0.1 mai-llion annually. At, full development the estihmrated net
foreign exchange benefits resulting fron the project gould be $2.5 million
per annum. The abattoir component would have subst-antial social benefits in
terms of sanitation and bette-r disease control, though such bene"its -are



difficult to quantify. The pig component, though small, would serve as a catalyst
for further development and could well be the forerunner of a domestic pig industry.
5i.       Increased job opportunities would also result from some 730 farms
and five abattoirs being more effectively and more intensively run. Total
employment would probably be the equivalent of 750 new Jobs, plus the incremental
manpower requirements for development of supporting services, although this
is not easy to quantify.  Average annual net income for participating farm
families would increase from an average of less than $500 to about $3,000.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMEINS AND AUTHORITY
52.       The draft Credit Agreement between the Republic of Honduras and
the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Central Bank of
Honduras and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of'
a draft resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
53.       The lending arrangements between the Republic of Honduras and the
Central Bank are set forth in the Credit Agreement and will be contained in
a Subsidiary Loan Agreement. The lending arrangements between the Central
Bank and the Participating Banks are set forth in the Project Agreement, but
will be included in Project Administration Agreements to be signed between
the Central Bank and the Participating Banks.
54.       Special conditions of effectiveness are that the execution and
delivery of the Project Agreement on behalf of the Banco Central, and of the
Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Republic of Honduras and the Central
Bank, on behalf of both parties.have been authorized by all necessary
action and have become effective,and that all action necessary for the Pro-
ject Commission to carry out its functions under the Project shall 'have been
taken.
55.       Before disbursements are authorized in respect of on-farm. sub-loans,
a Project Administration Agreement must have been entered into by the Central
Bank and the Participating Bank concerned.
56.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMEMATION
57.       I recommend that the Ekecutive Directors approve the proposed Credit.

C.  PROJECTS IN EXECUTION]
Ln. No. 495  Western Highway Paving Project: US$8.6 million Loan of May 26, 1967;
Closing Date: September 28, 1973.
Paving work has been completed, and we are awaiting final disburse-
ment applications.The loan is expected to be fully disbursed by the Closing Date.
Cr. No. 179 Livestock DeveloFment Project: US$2.6 million Credit of March 2, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
The credit has been fully c=nitted and disbursemen'ts are now pro-
ceeding on schedule.
Ln. No. 692  Fourth Power Project: US$5.5 million Loan and US$5.5 million
Cr. No. 201 Credit,both of June 24, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 197k'.
Engineering studies carried out after the signing of' the Loan/Credit
suggested, partly because of the proposed interconnection with Nicaragua, a nunber
of changes in the design of the project which made necessary amending the original
project description. These changes delayed bid preparation for and construction
of' the project's transmission and sub-transmission components by about six months.
Disbursements are still expected to be completed on schedule by June 30, 1974.
Ln. No. 767  Second Port Project: US$6.0 million Loan of June 25, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
The project provides for the expansion of Puerto Cortes in the north
of Honduras, and the construction of the new port of Henecan in t-he south.  After
loan signing, the Honduran Congress, partly for political reasons associated with
the border issue with El Salvador, expressed reservations about the construction
of a port at Henecan. However, the Goverrment that took office in December 1972
and the Port Authority decided to proceed with the construction of Henecan. As
a result of the delays, execution of the project is about 18 months behind
schedule.
/lThese notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the progress
of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems which are
being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.   They should be
read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not purport to
present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in projectu execution.

Ln. No. 8h1 Fifth Power Project: US$12.3 million Loan of June 28, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Construction of the La Ceiba diesel units, the generation component
of the project, is expected to proceed on schedule.  Delays in negotiations -with
the Nicaraguan utility (now completed) and major local customers may delay com-
pLetion of the transmission components of the project; campletion of construction
and disb-ursemenrts is still expected by the closing date of June 30, 1976.

Procurement
Arrangements:  Procurement for farm development items through local commercial
channels since international competitive bidding would not be
appropriate because of the diversity of items and small size of
individual purchases. Purchases of breeding stock would be
subject to the approval of the Project Director, and since the
type of animals required are best obtained from regions which
are free from foot and mouth disease, international competitive
bidding would not be appropriate. Grouping of orders for
abattoirs would be impractical because they are widely dispersed
throughout the country and their size, capacities and timing
of construction vary. For the small abattoirs each costing
about $h5 thousand, at least three bids would be sought before
awarding a contract, for either civil works or for equipment.
For larger facilities, tenders would be published locally,
submitted to known international suppliers and all official
representatives in Honduras of countries likely to be
interested.
Rate of
Return:        Overall economic rates of return are estimated at about 18
percent for on-farm investments and 24 percent for the abattoirs.
