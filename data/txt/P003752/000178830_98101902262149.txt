REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A FIFTH POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of $90 million to help
finance the Fifth Power Project. The loan would have a term of 25 years,
including five years grace with interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum. The
proceeds of the loan would be on-lent to the electric power authority, Peru-
sahaan Umum Listrik Negara (PLN), on the same terms except that interest and
other charges would be capitalized during the construction period. The Gov-
ernment would bear the foreign exchange risk.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report on Indonesia "Indonesia:    Development
Prospects and Needs" of April 15, 1975 (708-IND) described and analyzed
the structures of production and incomes, the recent changes in the avail-
ability of resources, and the medium and longer-term outlook for the
Indonesian economy. Country data are shown in Annex 1.
3.        In 1969, at the start of Indonesia's First Five-Year Plan, the
per capita income of the Indonesian population was probably no higher than
half a century ago. A majority of the population lived below a minimum
welfare standard, especially on Java. Most were dependent exclusively or
primarily on agriculture, and farms were generally very small. Under-
employment was widespread. While the inflation of the mid-1960s had been
overcome, infrastructure was still in a poor condition.
4.        The Government's efforts during the First Five-Year Plan period
(April 1, 1969 - March 31, 1974) were successful in putting the economy
on the development path. Most physical objectives were achieved or nearly
so, and there was substantial rehabilitation of run-down infrastructure
and Government enterprises in agriculture and manufacturing. Foodgrain
production increased by 4 million tons during the Plan period at an average
rate of 5 percent per annum. Investments increased at a fast rate,
rising from 9 to 19 percent of GNP. The reliance on foreign financing of
Government development expenditures was much smaller (57 percent) than the
rate of nearly 80 percent foreseen in the Plan. GDP increased at an annual
rate of over 7 percent. GNP per capita, in current prices, reached about $130
1/ in 1973. The Government instituted programs for the labor intensive

rehabilitation of infrastructure and other programs which created substantial
incomes and employment. In all, however, given the annual increase in the
labor force of about one million, one cannot be confident that the employment
situation improved during the First Plan period, and it is difficult to judge
from available information the extent to which the poorest section of the
population shared in the gains of development.
5.        The Second Five-Year Plan (April 1, 1974 - March 31, 1979) builds
on the achievements of the First Plan. While the First Plan dealt mainly
with the urgent needs for stabilization and rehabilitation under conditions
of great scarcity of resources, progress had been such that the Second
Plan could give much more attention to such problems as employment, equitable
distribution, regional growth, health and education. The Plan identifies a
number of specific low-income target groups and, in general, adopts an employ-
ment.oriented development strategy. It aims at a continued growth in invest-
ments, needed both because capital intensity will tend to increase as the
rehabilitation phase draws to an end, and because more socially-oriented
investments will be made. Overall, the Plan expects GDP to grow at 7.5
percent per annum.
6.        Over the decade 1961-71, Indonesia's population grew by 2.1 percent
a year. However, as a result of changes in the age, distribution and declining
mortality, the current annual growth rate is estimated at 2.5 percent. Even
under the most optimistic assumptions with regard to fertility decline, the
growth rate would only come down gradually, and the population would nearly
double by the end of the century. While Indonesia still has substantial
unutilized land reserves in the Outer Islands, these are limited in relation
to the expected population increase, and a further large increase in popula-
tion pressure - already severe on the Inner Islands - must be expected.
Since 1969, the Government has been operating and gradually extending a
family planning program. The number of acceptors has been increasing rapidly.
The Second Five-Year Plan foresees a progressively more vigorous and compre-
hensive attack on the population problem.
7.        During the years 1976-79, average annual additions to the labor force
are estimated at 1.2 million, increasing to more than 1.4 million in the years
1980-85. In addition, substantial underemployment exists, and there is the
risk that even relatively simple technological improvements may adversely
affect existing employment. The Second Plan's projections show that employment
growth would almost keep up with the growth in the labor force but even this
may prove optimistic. Thus, the employment thrust of the Plan needs to be
further strengthened if an appreciable increase in real labor earnings - and a
wider spread of the benefits of development - is to be attained.
8.        Towards the end of 1973, when the Second Plan was being finalized,
prospects for resource availability improved dramatically. In line with other
OPEC countries, the Government raised the export price of oil in successive
stages from $3.70 per barrel in April 1973 to $12.60 per barrel in July 1974.
Early in 1974 (and again in 1975) the Government successfully renegotiated the
contracts with foreign oil companies, enabling it to retain 1 r greater >hIire (f

the oil income. As a result, the net contribution of the oil sector to the
balance of payments and Government revenues was expected to increase very
considerably; a large increase in foreign exchange reserves and a budget
surplus were also anticipated for 1974/75 1/.
9.        By October 1974, foreign exchange reserves had risen by $650 mil-
lion from about $1 billion at the beginning of 1974/75 and Government revenues
exceeded the levels originally estimated. The Government authorized much
higher levels of expenditures, mainly for development, which reflected the
improved revenue prospects. However, the recessionary conditions in the in-
dustrial countries began to affect the volume of oil exports and production by
the middle of the year. Indonesia's low sulphur oil tended to become over-
priced 2/ as world oil demand slackened and output declined from an average of
1.45 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 1974 to 1.31 million
bpd in the second half. Proceeds from non-oil exports also started to decline
as prices, and in some cases export quantities, fell.
10.       In October 1974 also, the first signs appeared of what turned out
to be a substantial financial overextension by PERTAMINA, the national oil
company. PERTAMINA had undertaken a large and diversified investment program
financed to a substantial extent by short-term borrowing. In the third quarter
of 1974/75 it started withholding part of the corporate oil tax it had col-
lected on behalf of Government from the foreign oil companies; by the end
of the fiscal year a total of Rp 346 billion ($830 million) had been so with-
held and used to meet PERTAMINA's financial obligations. Early in 1975,
PERTAMINA failed to meet payments due to some foreign banks, and the Govern-
ment stepped in and took decisive action. It banned all independent foreign
borrowing by PERTAMINA and other Government enterprises and gave Bank Indonesia
the sole authority to contract foreign obligations, instructed Bank Indonesia
to provide the funds needed to meet PERTAMINA's external obligations, under-
took a comprehensive review of the oil company's investment projects and began
the process of reducing and re-planning the company's investment program and
of cancelling and renegotiating many of the related procurement contracts.
11.       The combination, in the latter half of 1974/75, of slackening re-
ceipts from exports of oil and other products, and of the need to meet
PERTAMINA's short term obligations resulted in a loss of the foreign exchange
reserves gained in the first half of the fiscal year; by March 31, 1975,
these reserves were at the same level as at the beginning of April 1974.
12.       In the first half of 1975/76, Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves
declined by a further $480 million, despite substantial capital inflows,
1/   Indonesian fiscal year April 1 to March 31.
2/   The premium on Indonesian oil has recently been reduced by the Govern-
ment's decision to raise the price of its main crude by 1.5 percent (to
$12.80) as compared with the 10 percent increase in the price of Saudi
Arabian light crude agreed at the meeting of OPEC in September 1975.

which included two syndicated public cash borrowings (totalling $575 million)
from the international capital market. With continuing recessionary con-
ditions in Indonesia's principal markets, exports failed to increase while
imports rose again (about 30% on an annual basis). Debt service payments on
behalf of PERTAMINA were also very large (about $1.0 billion). In the second
half of 1975/76, there was no appreciable change in export earnings, but
imports and debt service payments were lower and there was only a small re-
duction in capital inflows (two more cash loans, amounting to $475 million,
were raised). The country's foreign exchange reserve position was therefore
relatively stable in this period and the decline in the reserves for the
year as a whole amounted to nearly $500 million.
13.       Balance of payments prospects for 1976/77 appear on the whole good.
Recovery from the recession appears to be underway in most industrialized
countries, commodity prices seem to have bottomed out and oil exports from
Indonesia have been rising in recent months. The Government is in the process
of negotiating an increase in its share of the oil income. Rice imports are
expected to remain at the average level of recent years (Government estimate
is 1.4 million tons) but prices are likely to be considerably lower. The
country has sizeable stocks of fertilizer and only small amounts are expected
to be imported. However, there remains some uncertainty as to the exact
magnitude of payments due on account of PERTAMINA's financial obligations,
and the outcome for foreign exchange reserves during 1976/77 at this point
is difficult to predict.
14.      Budgetary revenues in 1974/75 were much lower than had been anti-
cipated at the middle of the yv;ar, partly due to the withholding of oil tax
revenues by PERTMIINA and partly to the shortfall in oil exports in the
second half of the year. TIe budget was, however, still in balance by year's
end as the Government reducec or deferred expenditures. The Covernment's re-
venues in 1975/76 also feLl substantially short of budget estimates, main-
ly as a result of lower oiL tax revenues. To keep the budget balanced, both
current and 1evelopment expenditures were reduced. Revenues, as well as
current and domestically 'Lnanced development expenditures, are now esti-
mated to have been roughly 15 percent lower than originally budgeted.
15.       In spite of the shortfall in budgetary revenues, and the adminis-
trative difficulties involved in the implementation of some projects, total
development expenditures in 1974/75 were Rp 770 billion ($1.9 billion), about
60 percent higher than the level in the previous year. In 1975/76 they are esti-
mated at Rp 1.27 trillion ($3.1 billion), including foreign project financing
totalling about $925 million and fertilizer subsidies amounting to $320
million. This is more than two and one-half times the actual expenditure in
1973/74; when adjusted for price changes it represents an increase of about
60 percent.
16.       Preliminary figures indicate that the high growth rate achieved
during 1969-1973 was maintained in 1974. In constant 1973 prices, gross
domestic product rose by 7.5 percent in 1974. Partial indicators seem to
point to slower growth of output in 1975. The inflation rate was very high
in the first part of 1974 as, among other factors, world inflation was trans-
miitted through both export and imprrt clhannels, blit abated somewhat later in



- 5 -
the year, partly as a result of the Government's stabilization measures in
April 1974. Nevertheless, for the year as a whole it reached 40 percent.
While still considerable, the average inflation rate for 1975 is expected. to
be only half of 1974's, or about 20 percent.
17.       In the aftermath of the PERTAMINA development, the Government is
faced with problems which, although serious, are surmountable. The review of
PERTAMINA's projects has resulted in the cancellation or renegotiation of
many contracts and reductions in project scope and size. 1/. The Government
has more recently undertaken a broader review of projects initiated by
various Government departments and other State entities in an effort to
bring future expenditures in line with available resources and the priorities
set out in the Second Plan. It is screening very carefully any major new
programs or projects, since considerable resources will be needed in the
next year or two for the completion of projects already initiated.
18.       The recent financial difficulties will effect the country's external
public debt service obligations during the rest of the decade. Debt service
payments over the next several years will be much larger than previously
envisaged as a result of the large borrowings by the Government in the last
fiscal year. Debt service in 1976/77 is now estimated at $700 million, which
would be about 12 percent of the value of officially projected net oil and
other exports. Debt service payments on all loans contracted up to December
31, 1975 may reach about one billion dollars by 1978, before declining as
shorter-term maturities are paid off. This is about $500 million more per year
than the payments projected on the basis of debt outstanding at the end of
1974. With debt service obligations from these borrowings substantially
higher than expected earlier (about 13 percent of exports in 1978), the margin
for further borrowing on other than semi-concessional terms has nIow become
much more limited. The amounts, terms and purposes of future borrowing
therefore need to be kept under continuous and careful review.
19.       While the recent balance of payments and budgetary difficulties
have upset some of the Government's plans, the long-term prospects for
Indonesia's development remain good.   The country has a substantial poten-
tial for further productive investment, employment and income growth. In
agriculture a vigorous pursuit of on-going programs in irrigation, develop-
ment of new plant varieties and technical services, provision of credit
and current inputs, etc., promises to yield high returns. In addition,
there are opportunities for the development of new areas, of food and plant-
ation crops. The industrial potential is good, both for modern capital
intensive natural resource-based activities and for more labor-intensive,
partly export-oriented industries.
1/   The planned capacity of the Krakatau Steel plant, for example, was re-
duced from 2,000,000 to 500,000 tons per year and the existing supply
contracts were reduced by $750 million.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA
20.       As indicated in Part I, Indonesia's plans emphasize a need to under-
take a large investment and development program designed to provide productive
work opportunities (with resultant increased incomes) for its presently under-
employed and growing labor force. Substantial external financing, on conces-
sional and semi-concessional terms, as well as a considerable volume of tech-
nical assistance, is also required. The Bank is planning to maintain its
lending to Indonesia and, in particular, to support projects designed to: im-
prove agricultural credit, research and extension; rehabilitate and expand
irrigation systems; assist transmigration and nucleus estate - smallholder
projects; increase non-agricultural employment in small towns and rural areas
by the establishment of small-scale industries; rehabilitate and expand
urgently needed transportation and other infrastructure; assist in the expan-
sion of manufacturing and mining, and in population control, education and
water supply.
21.       As of April 15, 1976, Indonesia had received 37 IDA credits total-
ling $561.8 million and 12 Bank loans amounting to $628 million. As of
February 29, 1976, IFC investments totalled $58.4 million. At the end of 1974
the Bank Group accounted for about 4 percent of Indonesia's total outstanding
public debt; by 1978 it is expected to account for 12 percent of total out-
standing public debt and 5 percent of public debt service obligations. A
summary statement of IDA credits, Bank loans and IFC investments as of March
31, 1976 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects, are contained in
Annex II. This is the seventh loan proposed for Indonesia this year and,
if approved, would bring total IBRD commitments since June 30, 1975 to $462
million.
22.       To date, agriculture accounts for just over one-third of all Bank
lending to Indonesia, including four IDA credits for estate rehabilitation,
six for the rehabilitation and expansion of the irrigation systems, two for
fisheries, and one each for seeds, beef cattle, sugar and smallholder tea
and rubber. In the industrial sector, the Bank Group has assisted in three
projects to expand fertilizer production and distribution capacity, three
for development finance companies (Government-owned and private) which play
a major role in fostering the growth of industrial enterprises, and one for
the Pulo Gadung industrial estate. Loans and credits have also been ex-
tended to the transportation, education, telecommunications, tourism, power,
population, urbanization and water supply sectors, and four credits have
been made for technical assistance to aid the Government in preparing and
formulating its development programs and projects.
23.       Prior to the proposed loan, the Bank has financed four power proj-
ects in Indonesia. Credits 165 and 334-IND in 1969 and 1974 respectively
(together $55 million) helped finance the rehabilitation and expansion of
distribution facilities in the Jakarta area. A third IDA Credit (399-IND)
in 1973 provided $46 million to assist in the first two 100 MW units of the



7-
Muara Karang power station near Jakarta. Loan 1127-IND ($41 million) was
made in 1975 for the third 100 MW unit of the Muara Karang project. Credit
165-IND is fully disbursed and Credit 334-IND is expected to be fully com-
mitted by mid-1976. Contracts have been awarded for the major equipment
of units 1 and 2 at Muara Karang. The options for major equipment of
unit 3 at Muara Karang (Loan 1127-IND), invited under Credit 399-IND, have
been exercised and project implementation is on schedule.
24.       Bank lending to Indonesia started with an IDA Credit in 1968 for
irrigation rehabilitation; almost half of all loans and credits have been
made since mid-1972, lending on Bank terms commenced in June 1974. Disburse-
ments on loans and credits are now proceeding at satisfactory levels. The
Indonesian authorities have become increasingly aware of the delays in proj-
ect execution caused by cumbersome procedures and the need to establish an
effective control system in BAPPENAS (The National Development Planning
Agency). At the Government's request, the Bank has arranged for assistance
under the Fourth Technical Assistance Credit (451-IND) to help set up a
monitoring and control system which it is hoped will lead to better proj-
ect administration.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
25.       Expansion of the public power facilities in Indonesia continues to
be an area of major Government investment in order to provide the foundation
for a developing economy. Responsibility for the public power sector belongs
to the state enterprise, Perusahaan Umum Listrik Negara (PLN). PLN has been
unable to provide reliable service, and in large areas it operates no power
facilities at all. As of March 31, 1975 PLN's total installed capacity was
less than 1,000 MW equal to about 7 watts per capita. While this is rela-
tively little in view of the substantial demand, it represents a considerable
increase from 650 MW in 1968 when the Bank first looked at PLN's operations.
Power consumption is still at a low level of about 17 Kwh per capita.
26.       The inadequacy and unreliability of the public power supply has
caused many industries, businesses and even domestic consumers to install
their own generation (captive plant); a recent study estimated that the
capacity of such plants in Java may be equivalent to as much as 40 percent of
the total installed capacity. These private installations are in most cases
too small to be economic either in terms of capital or operating cost
compared to larger central power plants.
27.       In the past sector development was determined largely by the avail-
ability of foreign assistance and as a consequence system standardization
suffered. This lack of standardization has resulted in systems that are not
fully compatible; for instance, West Java has a European standard of dis-
tribution whereas Central Java follows the American standard. As the Java
systems are gradually interconnected transmission problems will arise because
of differences between American and European relaying and grounding practices.



-8-
Power Market
28.       Between 1969 and 1975 public power sales in Indonesia increased at
an average annual rate of about 10 percent; the rate would have been higher
had there not been severe droughts and generation failures in 1970 and 1972.
In West Java and Jakarta during the same period electricity consumption (in-
cLuding captive plant) increased about 12 percent per year. Various studies,
in particular the Java System Development Study financed under Credit 399-
IND, estimate the existing demand is considerably higher than that actually
satisfied by PLN. That 90 percent of PLN's present customers are residen-
tial units indicates the extent of captive plant investment by manufacturers.
The Java system study estimated that at the end of 1973, PLN, constrained by
inadequate generation, transmission and distribution capacities, was able
to satisfy only about 50 percent of the estimated demand in Java. PLN has
started to undertake a substantial investment program that will enable it to
satisfy average demand increases of about 21 percent per year during the
period FY 1975-1984. During the same period sales are expected to rise by
about 20 percent per year with annual increases of about 13 percent at the
beginning of the decade rising to 24 percent towards the end. These pro-
jections are based on the lower demand increase alternative included in the
Java System Development Study which assumed a three-year continuous lag in
PLN's ability to satisfy the potential demand during the next decade, and on
an assessment of PLN's financial and physical capabilities in expanding its
generating, transmission and distribution facilities.
Development Plan
29.       To achieve the above growth targets, investments of about $5 bil-
lion (1975 price level) during FY 1975-1984 will be required, of which about
$3.3 billion will be needed in foreign exchange. This investment program
would add about 4,200 MW of generating capacity together with the transmis-
sion and distribution facilities required to market the output.
PLN
30.       Since its establishment as an autonomous public utility in 1965,
PLN has operated under the general policy guidance of the Ministry of Pub-
lic Works and Electric Power with a management board consisting of the
President-Director and five other directors responsible, respectively, for
planning, operations, construction, finance and administration. Board mem-
bers are appointed by the President of Indonesia for five-year terms. PLN
has been steadily gaining in efficiency, particularly since it was given
exclusive responsibility in 1972 for all aspects of electric power supply
throughout Indonesia, including sector planning, project execution and pro-
curement. Recently in response to a general Government effort to tighten
control over Government-owned enterprises and departments, the Min[ster
decreed that a ministerial committee would be responsible for PEN's pro-
curement of goods and services financed with funds wh[ch pass through the



- 9 -
national budgets, including proceeds of foreign loans. As presently consti-
tuted this committee includes representatives of the Ministry and PLN. How-
ever, agreement was reached that the Committee would in practice only supervise
the evaluation of bids received by PLN for goods and services financed from
funds of the national development budget (Section 4.02 of the Loan Agreement).
Management Consultant Services
31.       When the Bank first began to assist the power sector in Indonesia
in 1969, PLN was in very poor condition; it had inadequate plant, deficient
operating and maintenance techniques; planning, plant construction and
procurement wre outside management control; and it had a completely inade-
quate accounting and recording system. To remedy the situation, the Bank
helped finance through Credits 165 and 344-IND a comprehensive management
consulting effort. PLN selected the French firm of SOFRELEC for the major
work and Peat, Marwick and Mitchellof the United Kingdom to assist with
accounting matters.
32.       Progress has been excellent in the fields of finance and account-
ing. Good results have also been achieved in operations, particularly in
thermal plant operation and maintenance procedures. Both achievements are
due to the intensive training program initiated by SOFRELEC. Progress in
planning and construction, however, is still slow and it is particularly
in these fields that PLN's severe shortage of qualified personnel is most
apparent. However, completion of large training and scholarship programs
financed under previous Bank-financed projects will help improve staff capa-
bilities. Present plans envisage a gradual withdrawal of the management
consultants during 1976 and their replacement with five to seven individual
advisers who would be attached to PLN's various departments. Financing for
these advisers has been provided as part of the fourth power loan (1127-IND).
Financial Recovery Plan
33.       As a result of the consultants' initial work it was possible in
1972 to include in the third Bank financed project, Credit 399-IND, a finan-
cial recovery plan consisting of a program of measures designed to improve
PLN's management capabilities and bring the utility to the point of full
revenue/cost coverage by FY 1979. The Government and PLN would be obligated
under the proposed loan to continue its implementation (Part B of the Proj-
ect described in Schedule 2 to the Loan Agreement and Section 2.04 of the
Project Agreement). The plan established interim targets of 80 percent and
90 percent revenue/cost ratios in FY 1975 and FY 1977 respectively. Progress
in meeting these targets has been excellent; PLN actually attained a revenue/
cost ratio of 86 percent (adjusted to take account of understated operating
costs) in FY 1975. With the financial recovery proceeding on schedule, it
was agreed during negotiations that PLN in consultation with the Bank, would
develop a system of financial performance targets by March 31, 1977 which
would be used after the completion of the financial recovery plan (Section
4.08 of the Project Agreement). In addition, PLN has agreed not to incur



- 10 -
any debt service obligations falling due before it has achieved financial
recovery in accordance with the plan (Section 4.05 of the Project Agreement)
and to earn after this time sufficient revenues to meet all its costs and a
reasonable contribution towards new capital investments (Section 4.03 of the
Project Agreement). Due to the improved financial position of PLN, the Bank
has agreed to the abrogation of the covenant included in earlier loan and
credit agreements by which the Government would provide PLN with adequate
liquid funds to permit PLN to pay its debts within one month (Section 4.03
of the Loan Agreement).
Tariffs
34.       PLN has a high tariff level (average sale price 5.25 US cents per
kwh) when surcharges amounting to about 25 percent of the basic tariffs are
included. In the past, surcharges have been imposed equally on all consumers
irrespective of their tariff class. This practice has led to a distortion of
the basic tariff structure so that charges are not appropriately related to
costs. The reason the surcharges have grown so large is that PLN on its own
authority can increase them as needed, whereas changes to the basic tariff in-
volve more complex procedures culminating in final approval from the President
of the Republic. During negotiations agreement was reached that PLN, which
has already begun to remedy this distortion, will continue to restructure its
surcharges so as to restore cost-related prices (Section 4.07'of the Project
Agreement).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
35.       The proposed project, a continuation of PLN's network expansion
program, was appraised in November/December 1975. The Appraisal Report
(No. 1054a-IND) is being distributed separately and a loan and project sum-
mary is attached as Annex III. Negotiations took place in Washington D.C.,
April 5-9, 1976; the Borrower's delegation was led by Mr. Ely Soengkono,
Secretary-General, Ministry of Public Works and Electric Power.
Project Description
36.       PLN is presently carrying out a power distribution rehabilitation
and expansion program covering the requirements in West Java, and particularly
the Jakarta area. The program started with IDA assistance under Credits 165
and 334-IND. The foreign exchange cost of its continuation during FYs 1977-
1983 is estimated at $244 million. In addition to the proposed $90 million
Bank loan, the Government expects to borrow about $40 million from the Kuwait
Fund for Arabian Economic Development to help finance this program. The
proposed Project will cover part of the highest priority requirements in the
area during the periods FYs 1977-1980 and will help market the increased out-
put from generating facilities presently under construction. From 1975 to
1980 the generation capacity in the project area is scheduled to increase from
445 MW to 1,220 MW. To provide economic service the Project comprises voltage
standardization as well as distribution improvements. Specifically the pro-
ject will add to the existing systems: 906 new 20 KV substations; conversion
of 528 low voltage stations to 20 KV units; 222 connections for private



- 11 -
substations of large customers; conversion to 220 V service for about 123,500
customers; and connections for about 140,000 new customers.
Implementation
37.       The project will be carried out by PLN with the assistance of con-
sultants (SOFRELEC) retained to assist in the construction of two earlier Bank
financed distribution projects. The consultants will continue to help PLN in
design, preparation of bid documents, award of contracts, construction super-
vision and training of PLN's work force. The total requirement for consultant
services is estimated at 490 man-months and the estimated cost per man-month
is about $7,300 (including salary, overheads and fees). Extending the present
contract with SOFRELEC would be highly advantageous in view of the consultants'
ongoing staff training program and their familiarity with PLN operations, es-
pecially the Jakarta-West Java distribution expansion program. It may be pos-
sible for PLN to reduce the cost of consultants in view of the nature of the
engineering work to be undertaken. An important element of the consultant's
contract will be a training component designed to improve PLN's distribution
planning and construction capabilities so that consultants' assistance would
not be required in future. Conclusion of all contractual arrangements between
PLN and the consultants satisfactory to the Bank is a condition of effective-
ness of the proposed loan (Section 6.01(c) of the Loan Agreement). Construc-
tion of the project will be undertaken by PLN's own labor force assisted by
local contractors. A nucleus of trained laborers is available (trained under
Credits 165 and 334-IND) and additional work force for the expansion to the
other areas outside Jakarta will receive on-the-job and classroom training in
existing centers.
Project Cost Estimates and Financing
38.       Total project costs are estimated at $164 million including a for-
eign exchange component of $90 million, 55 percent of the total cost. A
detailed cost estimate appears in Annex III. Base project costs ($107.7
million) were determined from material and construction costs for ongoing
distribution projects on the basis of 1975 prices. Physical and price con-
tingencies totaling $56.3 million have been calculated as follows: physical
contingencies of 10 percent, and price contingencies of 20 percent per year
on local costs and 12 percent - 8 percent - 8 percent - 8 percent per year
on foreign costs during the construction period.
39.       The proposed loan of $90 million would finance the foreign ex-
change costs of the project whereas the local cost component ($74 million)
of the project would be covered from PLN's own funds including consumer con-
tributions, and from Government sources. As in the case of the fourth power
project (Loan 1127-IND), the proceeds of the Bank loan will be relent by the
Borrower to PLN under a subsidiary loan agreement acceptable to the Bank;
conclusion of this agreement is a condition of loan effectiveness (Section
6.01(b) of the Loan Agreement). The subsidiary loan will carry the same
repayment terms and interest rate as the Bank loan. However, the Govern-
ment will finance interest and commitment charges during construction to
avoid debt service payments during PLN's financial recovery period, and
bear the foreign exchange risk of the loan.

Procurement and Disbursement
40.       Equipment, materials and supplies to be financed from proceeds of
the proposed loan will be procured by international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank guidelines for procurement. With prior agreement of
the Bank, contracts for items costing less than $50,000 each up to an aggregate
of $500,000 would be permitted under PLN's normal procedures which are accept-
able to the Bank (Schedule 1, Part B, to the Project Agreement). Some partici-
pation of local manufacturers is envisaged, in which case a 15 percent margin
of preference on the c.i.f. price, or the prevailing customs duties, if lower,
will be applied in bid evaluation.
41.       The Bank loan will be disbursed to meet 100 percent of the foreign
exchange costs of imported material and equipment and 95 percent of the ex-
factory price of locally manufactured goods. Disbursements will also be made
to meet 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of consultant services. Dis-
bursement of the proposed loan is expected to be completed by March 31, 1981.
Project Benefits
42.        Much of this project's benefits derive from the installation of
appropriate facilities to distribute the increased power supply expected to
be available by 1980, an increase in installed capacity from 445 MW in 1975
to 1,220 MW. The project justification is based on the economies that will
result from having a reliable power supply as well as uniform voltage levels.
Furthermore it rests on the need for expanding service to consumers and areas
presently not served. Relatively few residents are connected to PLN's power
network in the project region and those who are frequently receive poor
service. Currently in the Jakarta region electricity service reaches only
about one of every 44 persons and in West Java about one of every 87 persons.
The existing voltage systems are completely overloaded; in some instances
voltages drop as much 40 percent and the average customer receives voltage
20% below normal.
43.       The peak load on the distribution system in the project area is
estimated to double between 1974 and 1980 increasing from 234 MW to 463 MW.
A total of 123,500 customers would be changed from 127 to 220 volt
service; 140,100 new customers would be connected; and 222 connections would
be provided to private substations of large customers.
44.       As the proposed project involves various distribution networks
and is part rehabilitation and part expansion, it is impossible to rationally
allocate the increased sales and decreased losses directly attributable to
the proposed project. Consequently, an internal economic rate of return
has not been calculated for the project. However, the internal financial
rate of return of PLN's development program is approximately 11 percent
and would be higher if it were possible to further reduce system losses and
to increase sales with the same investments.

45.       No ecological problems arise in connection with the Project.    In
congested areas, the medium voltage system (20 KV) will be underground with
transformers located in kiosks and the low voltage system (220/380 volts)
generally overhead. In less congested areas, both systems will be overhead
with the transformers mounted on poles.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
46.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Republic of
Indonesia, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and Perusahaan Umum
Listrik Negara, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a
draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
47.       Features of the Agreements of special interest are referred to
in paragraphs 30, 33, 34, 37, 39 and 40 of this report. Special conditions of
effectiveness are:
(a) the conclusion of a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government
and PLN providing for the onlending of the proceeds of the proposed
loan; and
(b) the employment of consultants by PLN.
48.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
49.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Cr. No. 127:       Irrigation Rehabilitation:  US$5 Million Credit of
September 6, 1968; Effective Date: March 25, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
All civil works were completed on March 31, 1976. Additional
drainage work will be carried out under Loan 1100-IND. The proposed Irrigation
VII Project would provide funds for tertiary development under this project
and other on-going irrigation projects. The closing date has been postponed
by one year to allow for payment of late accounts. The adequacy and timeliness
of operation and maintenance of completed irrigation rehabilitation projects
has been recently discussed with the Government. As a result the Government
has allocated for operation and maintenance for the present fiscal year an
amount double that of last year's budget.
Cr. No. 154:       Highways:  US$28 Million Credit of June 20, 1969;
Effective Date: October 2, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31, 1975.
Rehabilitation work, of acceptable quality, has been
completed. The work accomplished exceeded the project's original target.
The program for improved highway maintenance included in the project has
been completed. A project completion report is being prepared for issuance
before June 30, 1976.
Cr. No. 155:       Agricultural Estates:  US$16 Million Credit of June 20,
1969; Effective Date: December 10, 1969;
Closing Date:   December 31, 1976.
With improvements in management and much higher inter-
national prices, particularly for palm oil, prevailing in 1974, the
financial position of the estate groups has improved. The field and
factory standards have now been raised to a good technical level and
the managements have been advised to concentrate on cost control in order
to prepare for the time when produce prices may become less attractive.
The combined efforts of the management, consultants and IDA missions
to review project implementation are yielding good results. The closing
date has been postponed to December 31, 1976 to enable payment to con-
sultants for services for other rubber estates.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 165:       Electricity Distribution:  US$15 million Credit of
October 29, 1969; Effective Date: June 1, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
The closing date was postponed to December 31, 1975, to
allow for payment of small amounts outstanding. The project completion re-
port will be prepared in conjunction with that for Credit No. 334.
Cr. No. 193:       PUSRI Fertilizer:  US$35 Million Credit of June 15,
1970 (as amended May 21, 1973); Effective Date:
January 15, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The urea plant has successfully passed its performance
test and is operating at close to 90 percent of rated capacity. The gas
gathering and transmission system is also completed and sufficient gas is
being delivered to the plant. The closing date has been postponed to December
31, 1976 to allow for delivery and installation of remaining equipment.
Cr. No. 194:       Second Agricultural Estates:   US$17 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970; Effective Date: February 9, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
After initial delays, there have been considerable
improvements in management and these, combined with high prices, particular-
ly for palm oil, have resulted in the two estate groups being put in a
much stronger financial position. On the rubber group (PNP IV) more effort
is necessary to improve agricultural standards and tapping methods. With
the rapid expansion of investment of the palm oil group (PNP VI), there is
a need to employ expertise in financial planning, control and management,
which are now the main constraints to efficient development. This estate
group is undertaking action in this respect. The closing date has been
postponed by one year to allow payment for remaining equipment, civil
works and consultants' contracts.
Cr. No. 195:       Second Irrigation Rehabilitation:   US$18.5 Million Credit
of June 15, 1970; Effective Date: December 31, 1970;
Closing Date: November 30, 1976.
Problems of quality and progress of construction still
exist, but the project entity assisted by the consultants are tackling
these vigorously, and the situation is improving, although not sufficiently
to make up for earlier delays. Costs are likely to be double the overall
appraisal estimate, due to inflation, but the Government will provide any
additional funds required. Completion of disbursements will be about two
years behind the original schedule.
Cr. No. 210:       Telecommunications Expansion:   US$12.8 Million Credit
of July 13, 1970; Effective Date: February 18, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
The project has been completed except for the installation
of the telex exchange at Medan, which is now expected to be in service by



ANNEX II
Page 6 of 14
June 1976. The delay in completion of the Medan telex exchange was due to
late completion of a building to house the exchange. The closing date of
the Credit has been extended up to June 30, 1976, which should be suffi-
cient to allow for payments of outstanding contracts. The audit of finan-
cial statements for FY1973 is expected to be completed in May 1976 and
efforts are being made to ensure timely audit in future.
Cr. No. 211:      Fisheries:   US$3.5 Million Credit of July 13, 1970;
Effective Date: January 15, 1971; Closing Date:
June 30, 1976.
The project is about two years behind the original schedule due
to delays in engaging consultants and in executing contracts for the shore
facilities. There has been a substantial project cost increase but the
project is still expected to be financially viable due to the greatly
increased skipjack prices. Government has recently appointed new project
management. The first stage of operation of project facilities is expected
to start shortly.
Cr. No. 219:       Education:  US$4.6 Million Credit of November 6, 1970;
Effective Date: January 29, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976.
Project implementation in the Department of Education
is satisfactory. Civil works for the five Technical Training Centers
(TTCs) have been completed. About 90 percent of the equipment has been
purchased and about 60 percent delivered and installed. All TTCs will
operate at full capacity by January 1976 when the new academic year begins.
Over 500 technical teachers have completed or are about to complete their
training. Technical assistance financed by the U.K. for the project is
also satisfactory. Disbursement has improved considerably. Revised
total project cost is now about 40 percent above appraisal estimate. The
Government will finance the cost overrun. The project is expected to be
completed about three months ahead of schedule.
Cr. No. 220:       Third Irrigation Rehabilitation:   US$14.5 Million Credit
of November 6, 1970; Effective Date: May 28, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
Construction remains about two to three years behind
schedule. The problems which caused this delay - difficulties in preparation
of contract document, late financial allocations, heavy rains in the 1973 con-
struction season and, more recently, slow response by GOI to high inflation
rates and consequent civil works costs overruns - have been mainly overcome,
but time lost cannot be regained. Estimated project cost is 50 percent above
the appraisal estimate, but with higher rice prices on the world market, the
project's economic rate of return remains over 20 percent. The closing date
has been postponed by 18 months as a result of project delay.

Cr. No. 246:      Seeds:   US$7.5 Million Credit of May 19, 1971;
Effective Date: December 7, 1971; Closing Date:
September 30, 1977.
Significant progress has been made in the construction
of the irrigation infrastructure and in land development at the National
Seeds Corporation (NSC). Construction is proceeding satisfactorily and is
now 70 percent completed. The inadequacy of NSC management at the opera-
tional level is reflected in technical production problems, low yields of
seed and high costs of production. Increasing nation-wide production prob-
lems caused by prevalent disease, pests and insect losses has resulted in
government authorities now giving certified seed production high priority.
Cr. No. 259:      Tea:  US$15 Million Credit of June 24, 1971; Effective
Date: September 17, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
Agricultural achievements to date have far exceeded
appraisal expectations necessitating construction and rehabilitation
of three additional factories. Project completion, estimated for December
1977, can probably be advanced by up to one year. Rising costs are creating
pressure on available funds and the main challenge for the two PTPs will
be to reduce working capital requirements, as well as overhead and indirect
costs, and improve labor productivity.
Cr. No. 260:      Second Highway:   US$34 Million Credit of June 24, 1971;
Effective Date: August 10, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976.
Construction work is about 80 percent finished and should
be completed by August 1976, about one and a half years behind schedule.
The delay was caused largely by slow progress in mobilizing contractors,
difficulties in equipment delivery, heavy rains and landslides. The closing
date has therefore been postponed by 15 months to December 31, 1976. Design
standards for the road sections have been slightly lowered and some savings
have been achieved, which, together with other savings have partly offset
construction cost increases of 12 percent.
Cr. No. 275:      Third Technical Assistance: US$4.0 Million Credit of
December 29, 1971; Effective Date: February 25,
1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Progress on this project is satisfactory. The closing
date has been postponed by another year to complete disbursements for
ongoing studies.
Cr. No. 288:      Second Education:   US$6.3 Million Credit of March 9,
1972; Effective Date: June 7, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
This agricultural training project, being implemented
by the Department of Agriculture, is about 16 months delayed because of



ANNEX II
Page 8 of 14
late appointment of consultant architects, lack of counterpart funds, delays
in bid analysis and in awarding contracts. As a result, civil works,
which were to be completed already, have not commenced. Furniture and
equipment procurement have therefore been deferred. Unlike the physical
aspects of the project, the educational aspects are generally on schedule.
Total project costs are now estimated to be 90 percent higher than the
original estimate. Government has budgeted for the cost overrun. Disburse-
ment, which has been slow, should improve since civil works contracts have
now been awarded.
Cr. No. 289:      Fourth Irrigation Rehabilitation:   US$12.5 Million Credit
of March 9, 1972; Effective Date: May 5, 1972; Closing
Date: June 30, 1977.
Civil Works and equipment purchases for the main project,
Pekalen-Sampean, are proceeding but completion of civil works will be
about two years behind schedule. Due to inflation, project costs are
likely to be substantially higher than appraisal estimates. Consultants
for the various studies are at work with their counterparts. Disbursements
are also on schedule.
Cr. No. 300:      Population:   US$13.2 Million Credit of April 20, 1972;
Effective Date: November 2, 1972; Closing Date: June 30,
1978.
Progress of this project is generally satisfactory.
Steps are being taken to improve preparation and implementation of project
components concerned with communications, research and evaluation. All
vehicles have been procured and good progress is being made with equipment
procurement. The civil works section of the Project Implementation Unit
functions well but is underutilized because of delays in making policy
decisions. Construction costs will exceed appraisal estimates by 135
percent. Population Education is now being introduced into school curricula
after a successful trial. Despite its limitations, the national family
planning program, of which the project is an integral part, is expanding
annually and showing good results.
Cr. No. 310:      Development Finance Co. (BAPINDO I):   US$10 Million Credit
of June 7, 1972; Effective Date: August 10, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
This credit is fully committed.
Cr. No. 318:       Inter-Island Fleet Rehabilitation:  US$8.5 Million
Credit of June 28, 1972; Effective Date: October 19,
1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1977.
Progress on this project is slow but funds are expected to
be fully committed by September 30, 1977. Due to substantial cost increases,
only about half of the anticipated tonnage will be rehabilitated.

Cr. No. 319:       Fourth Agricultural Estates:   US$11 Million Credit of
June 28, 1972; Effective date: January 30, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
The physical progress of the project is ahead of the
appraisal schedule. The financial position of the estate group is dif-
ficult due to an unsatisfactory debt/equity ratio. Measures to improve
the situation are under review.
Cr. No. 334:       Second Electricity Distribution:   US$40 Million Credit
of September 29, 1972; Effective Date: March 12, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The Jakarta distribution program financed from Credits
165-IND and 334-IND (together $55 million) encountered implementation delays
due to procurement problems and cumbersome management procedures. As a result
the project is two years behind the original schedule. These difficulties
have been resolved and recent progress is encouraging. No further delays
are therefore expected.
Cr. No 355:        Beef Cattle Development:  US$3.6 Million Credit of
January 31, 1973; Effective Date: May 30, 1973;
Closing Date: March 31, 1980.
Several problems have seriously delayed project imple-
mentation. Government's budget allocation has been insufficient; and fi-
nancial management and coordination have been weak. The last supervision
mission undertook a thorough project review and its recommendations, which
include major changes in project scope and objectives, are presently under
discussion with Government.
Cr. No. 358:       North Sumatera Smallholder Development:   US$5 Million
Credit of February 14, 1973; Effective Date: August 13,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
Project performance, which had suffered from severe fin-
nancial and organizational difficulties, has improved greatly. Physical
progress is encouraging; rubber planting and rice intercropping are now
on schedule. There is some room for improvement in financial management,
in which consultants are assisting. Total project costs are now estimated
at about three times the original estimate of US$10 million. Disbursements
are expected to be completed ahead of schedule.
Cr. No. 387:       Third Education:  US$13.5 Million Credit of June 1,
1973; Effective Date: August 29, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The project is about 10 months behind schedule, mainly due
to insufficient top management staff and paper shortages last year. The paper



ANNEX II
Page 10 of 14
shortage has been overcome and about 32 million text books will be printed by
January 1976, about four months behind schedule. Steps are being taken to
strengthen project management and to improve arrangements for expert services.
Measures to improve project implementation have been discussed and agreed with
the Government. The book testing and teacher training programs are on schedule,
but their results have not yet been evaluated. Procurement of instructional
equipment will be completed by early 1976.
Cr. No. 388:      Third Highways:   US$14 Million Credit of June 1, 1973;
Effective Date: June 25, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977.
Construction work on the two North Sulawesi road sections
in the project was started early in 1974 under two contracts and is now 60
percent completed. Construction has been delayed mainly because of long
mobilization periods and heavy rains. Project costs will likely exceed
original estimates (including contingencies) by 57 percent mainly due to
sharply escalated prices. The training program has been completed success-
fully.
Cr. No. 399:       West Java Thermal Power:  US$46 Million Credit of
June 22, 1973; Effective Date: August 28, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
Bids received for the first two 100 mw units at Muara
Karang were about 65 percent higher than estimated at the time of appraisal.
This, together with construction cost increases, has resulted in an increase
in the total project cost of more than 100 percent. Government will provide
the additional funds required. PLN has satisfactorily met the initial targets
in its financial recovery plan provided for under the terms of the Credit
Agreement.
Cr. No. 400:       Smallholder and Private Estate Tea:   US$7.8 Million
Credit of June 22, 1973; Effective Date: November 30,
1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1982.
Planting is presently slightly behind schedule but
it is expected that targets will be achieved or even exceeded by the end
of the 1975/76 planting season. Project nurseries are well organized
and field work is proceeding well. Also non-participating farmers have
benefitted from the project. Total project costs are estimated to be
double the amount originally envisaged and project management is attempting
to achieve cost reductions. Due to the high prices for tea (about twice
the level expected at the time of appraisal), the economic rate of return
is still satisfactory.

Cr. No. 405:       Sugar Industry Rehabilitation:  US$50 Million Credit of
June 26, 1973; Effective Date: April 22, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
In view of the rapid and continuing increase in the cost
of sugar factory machinery and the more recent shortage of budgetary funds,
the scope of the above-mentioned project has been reduced by the deletion of
six minor rehabilitations from the project description. The revised project
consists of the major rehabilitation of two factories and the construction
of a new factory. Credit funds have been reallocated from the minor to
the major rehabilitation and to the new construction.
Cr. No. 428:      Pulo Gadung Industrial Estate:   US$16.5 Million Credit
of September 14, 1973; Effective Date: November 13,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Of 430 ha earmarked for the project, about 270 ha had been
acquired by end 1975, and 108 ha had been developed to readiness for
occupation. 42 factories are operating on the estate and 35 more are in
various stages of construction or commissioning. The rate of new applica-
tions for land allotment has been slower in recent months than in the past,
and the estate is intensifying its promotional efforts. Overall, operations
are profitable, despite an increase in construction costs.
Cr. No. 436:      Private Development Finance Company of Indonesia
(PDFCI): US$10 Million Credit of November 2, 1973;
Effective Date: March 6, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
After a long start-up period and difficulties in finding
and recruiting qualified local staff, PDFCI-has now reached the operating
stage. Commitments have started and are expected to increase rapidly
as PDFCI's own operational capability improves.
Cr. No. 451:       Fourth Technical Assistance:   US$5 Million Credit of
January 2, 1974; Effective Date: February 15, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Progress under the project is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 479:       Bali Tourism:  US$16.0 Million Credit of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: December 4, 1974; Closing Date:
August 31, 1979.
Project implementation has improved after initial diffi-
culties. Tender documents for all major infrastructure works were issued
in January 1976. The earliest possible completion date has shifted from
February 1979 to October 1979. Budgetary allocations as requested by the
Bali Tourism Development Corporation for FY76/77 are satisfactory. Negotia-
tions with one group of investors are in progress but otherwise investor in-
terest appears to be low. Promotional efforts to attract additional investors
have been intensified in 1976.

Cr. No. 480:       Fisheries Credit:  US$6.5 Million Credit of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: January 8, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Lending for fishponds is now on schedule, and the contract for
construction of shore facilities at Ambon has been awarded. There may how-
ever be some delays in skipjack vessel construction due to procurement pro-
blems. Although significant cost increases are envisaged, the project is
still expected to be financially viable because of increases in fish prices.
Cr. No. 514:         Jatiluhur Irrigation Extension:   US$30 Million Credit
of October 3, 1974; Effective Date: January 10, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
The consultants are designing works and preparing contract
documents. The first civil works contract is expected to be let in August 1976,
about one year behind the original schedule.
Loan No. 1005:       Railway:  US$48.0 Million Loan of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: August 16, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
Procurement of material and equipment, which had been
slow due to poor organization and inadequate budget allocation, has now
improved. Bids have been received for most items and the bulk of the con-
tracts should be signed soon. Passenger traffic in 1975 is slightly lower
than in 1974, but still higher than forecast; freight traffic has continued
to decline due mainly to poor maintenance and inadequate motive power, which
should improve towards the end of 1976. Although tariffs were raised in May
1975, increasing passenger revenues by about 25 percent and freight revenues
by about 10 percent, the operating ratio is likely to deteriorate further, as
operating costs have continued to rise at a faster rate.
Loan No. 1040:       Jakarta Urban Development:   US$25 Million Loan of
September 27, 1974; Effective Date: January 15, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Progress on the Kampung Improvement Program has been
very good; costs were less than estimated, allowing additional work to be
undertaken. Execution of the Klender Sites and Services Scheme is one year
behind schedule due to disagreements about site boundaries. Most consultant
contracts commenced early in 1976.
Loan No. 1049:       Five Cities Water Supply:   US$14.5 Million Loan of
October 31, 1974; Effective Date: May 21, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
Due to administrative and managerial problems the
project is running 8-10 months behind schedule. This delay together



ANNEX II
Page 13 of 14
with higher rates of inflation than anticipated is expected to increase
project costs 20-25 percent above the appraisal estimate. Water Enterprises
have now been established in each of the five cities and good progress has
been made in their staffing. The anticipated interdepartmental decree which
would govern the relationship of the Water Enterprises to the Central Govern-
ment's Directorate of Sanitary Engineering has not been issued; it is now
proposed to clarify this relationship in a Presidential Decree which is
being drafted.
Loan No. 1054:     Development Finance Co. (BAPINDO II):   US$50 Million
Loan of November 20, 1974; Effective Date: January 14,
1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Commitments and disbursements initially were slower
than expected, but they should increase in the second half of FY76. The
progress of this project is satisfactory.
Loan No. 1089:     Second Fertilizer Expansion:   US$115 Million Loan of
February 28, 1975; Effective Date: April 29, 1975;
Closing Date: August 31, 1978.
Work on the PUSRI III project is proceeding according to
schedule. Work on the related gas pipeline is experiencing delay, but steps
are being taken to expedite implementation.
Loan No. 1100:     Sixth Irrigation:  US$65 Million Loan of April 10,
1975; Effective Date: June 20, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1982.
Consultants for the project and technical assistance advisors
have been selected. Construction work is about five months behind schedule
due to the delay in selection of consultants.
Loan No. 1127:     Fourth Power:  US$41 Million Loan of June 17, 1975;
Effective Date: October 23, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1980.
The options for a third 100 MW unit at Muara Karang, which
were included in the tenders for the first two units financed under Credit
399, have been exercised. The project is on schedule and expected to be
completed during 1978.
Loan No. 1139:     Fertilizer Distribution:  US$68 Million Loan of
July 10, 1975; Effective Date: August 28, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Progress design is satisfactory. About 60 percent of the
equipment and materials required for the project have been ordered.
