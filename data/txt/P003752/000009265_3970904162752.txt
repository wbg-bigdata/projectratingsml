FIFTH POWER PROJECT (Loan 1259-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
The project, supported by Ln. 1259-IND for US$90.0 million made to
the Government of Indonesia (GOI) in FY76 and relent to che NationaL
Electricity Authority (PLN), consisted of a distribution expansion program in
and around the capital city - Jakarta. It involved a new medium voLtage (20
kV) system, rehabilitation and extension of the recently introduced (230-400
V) low voltage system, provision of customer related items co facilitate quick
changeover from the oLd (120-200 V) Low voltage system, and associated
consultancy services. The loan was extended beyond the originally stipulated
closing date (3/31/81) and closed on 12/31/82. An undisbursed sum of $1.14
million was cancelled. This Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by
the East Asia and Pacific Regional Office based on the Bank's appraisal
report, supervision reports and other documents in the Bank's files and a
completion report prepared by PLN.
The PCR summarizes the main points of interest. The loan was the
fifth of a continuing series of IDA credits and Bank loans to PLS, begun in
1969, which have helped it to develop into an efficient and financially viable
national entity.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report
to the Government and PLN. Comments received from the Ministry of Mines and
Energy and PLN are reproduced as Attachments A and B.

FIFTH POWER PROJECT (Loan 1259-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
The main objectives of the project were to supply the growing demand
for electricity, of industrial, commercial and residential consumers in the
metropolitan area around Jakarta in a reliable and economic manner. The
project, as finally implemented, consisted of a new medium voltage (20 kV)
system comprising 1,187 km of cables and overhead lines with associated
substations, 1,042 km of low voltage ;230/400 V) system extensions, and
extensive customer services to facilitate connection of new consumers and
rapid change over from the replaced old distribution systems.
The project fully accomplished its objectives (paras. 3.01 to
3.03). The increases in the number of industrial and residential consumers,
the actual peak load and energy consumption substantially exceeded
expectations at the start of the project (para. 3.01). The economic rate of
return of this distribution project was not estimated at appraisal in view of
limitations in identifying benefits associated with the project; nor has it
been calculated in this PCR. The financial rate of return (IFRR) of PLN's
investment program was estimated at not less than 11 at appraisal. The IFRR,
re-estimated on completion of the project, is now 9.8% which is slightly
lower. This is primarily because of the lag in PLN's tariff increases between
1978-1981(para. 5.08). The project significantly contributed to PLN's
development as an efficient and financially viable public utility through its
vastly increased energy sales - about 40% of PLN's total in 1982/83 - and by
building up expertise in planning, construction and operation of distribution
systems.
Despite significant increases in the scope of the project (para.
2.07) the final project cost estimate was within the appraisal estimate. This
was mainly due to the 30% reduction in equipment costs during 1978-79. The
main covenants agreed to were implemented (Annex 1).

FIFTH POWER PROJECT (Loan 1259-IND)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
Background and Bank Group Involvement in the Power Sector
1.01      The National Electricity Authority (PLN), which repo ts to the
Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME), is the sole public agency responsible for
generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in Indonesia. It was
formed in 1951 after nationalization of three Dutch companies. The Bank
Group's association with PLN started in 1969. Access to electricity was
extremely limited. Many industries, commercial establishments and even house-
holds generated their own power. Part of the problem was lack of generation,
but the major problem was the antiquated and inadequate distribution system.
The first two Bank Group operations - Credits 165 of 1969 and 334-IND of
1971 2- - initiated the process of rehabilitation and expansion of the
electricity distribution system of Jakarta which then accounted for about 30X
of PLN's sales. On the institutional development side, they provided for con-
sulting services for improvement of PLN's management and training. These were
carried out by SOFRELEC of France. In 1972 PLN's status was changed from that
of a department of a ministry to a public corporation with its own charter,
starting PLN's growth as a modern organization. The Bank Group then followed
with Credit 399-IND in 1973 and Loan 1127-IND in 1975 to assist in zetting up
the first stage (300 MW) of 3he large (700 MW) West Java Thermal Power Station
at Muara Karang in Jakarta.3   This report covers the fifth Bank Group power
operation (Loan 1259-IND) for further rehabilitation and expansion of the
electricity distribution system of Jakarta, its three satelite towns of Bogor,
Tangerang and Bekasi, (together with Jakarta, called JABOTABEK). The project
provided the Bank Group with the opportunity of continuing its efforts to sub-
stantially improve PLN's operations and assist in its institutional growth.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION, AND APPRAISAL
Origin, Preparation and Justification
2.01      In 1975, as the earlier operations (para. 1.01) were nearing comple-
tion, SOFRELEC prepared a feasibility report on a comprehensive scheme of
systematic expansion of the distribution systems of Jakarta and Bandung to
It   A completion report was prepared by PLN.

meet the rapid growth of demand in the area from 1978 to 1982. The GOI
requested Bank assistance to implement the project which involved a foreign
cost of $164 million.
2.02      The distribution program described in para. 2.01 above was crucially
important as the area was expected to provide about 40X of all PLN's revenues
by completion. It was also necessary to fully utilize the generating capacity
of the upcoming Muara Karang thermal power station (para. 1.01).
Project Appraisal, Negotiations and Effectiveness
2.03      The project was appraised in November/December 1975.  Due to limita-
tions in the size of the Bank loan ($90 million equivalent) it was agreed
during the negotiations held in April 1976 that proceeds of this loan (Ln.
1259-IND) would be used to implement the highest priority items of the distri-
bution expansion program (para. 2.01) covering needs up to 1980. The loan was
approved by the Board in May 1975 and became effective in September 1975 with
no significant delay in meeting the conditions laid down.
2.04      During negotiations it was agreed that the scope of the Bank proj-
ect, illustratively defined in the appraisal reporc, would be modified and
adjusted to reflect anticipated cofinancing. Early in 1977, the Kuwait
Development Fund and the Abu Dhabi Fund decided to assist in financing the
entire Bandung component of the 1978-1982 distribution expansion program with
a loan of about $34 million leaving Bank funds to be utilized to cover a more
extensive portion of the program for Jakarta and its three satellite towns,
Bogor, Tangerang and Bekasi, an area known by the acronym JABOTABEK.
Project Description
2.05      The main components of the project were (a) a new medium voltage
system at 20 kV comprising about 1,187 km of cables and overhead lines, 988
ground-level substations and 766 pole-mounted transformers; (b) rehabilitation
and extension of 1,042 km of the low voltage (230-400v) system; (c) provision
of customer related items such as service connections (228,000), energy meters
(300,000) and transformers (123,500) for change over of low voltage from the
old 120/200 volt system; (d) consulting services for engineering, construction
supervision and training; and (e) a comprehensive financial recovery plan con-
tinued from earlier operations (Credit 399-IND and loan 1127-IND).
Project Objectives
2.06      The main objectives of the project were to:
(a) reliably and economically meet the surging demand for electricity in
the metropolitan area around Jakarta and to increase PLN's share of
the industrial market (paras. 2.02, 3.02);
(b) train PLN personnel by consultants for project construction and for
its future operation; and
(c) improve PLN's financial management and performance by (i) meeting
specified short-term targets (para. 2.05(e)), (ii) devising long-
term strategies and (iii) through more appropriate tariffs (paras.
5.01, 5.03).

2.08      The customer services program has remained practically unchanged.
There were modest increases in the Low voltage network program but a signi-
ficant increase in the scope of the new 20 kV medium voltage system. The
latter was requested in 1978 by PLN to enable it to capture a larger share of
the industrial market, an important project objective. The Bank agreed as the
increase could be accommodated within the agreed loan amount due to reduced
prices of equipment and material encountered during implementation (para.
3.0B). The excess of some 400 km in the length of 20 kV cables over the
feasibility report figures is due to a PLN decision to eliminate the old
heavily overloaded and unreliable 6 kV/12 kV systems to improve reliability of
supply and reduce system losses. This decision was appropriate. The 12 kV
system will now be phased out in 1985/86.

ments exceeded targets as would be seen from the table below.

Actuals are in parenthesis.
3.02      In 1975 PLN's sales were predominantly (44Z) to residential
consumers - a relatively unprofitable situation. By 1982/83 the share of the
more lucrative industrial and commercial establishments had increased from 18Z
in 1976 to 33% contributing substantiaLly to PLN's financi.1 viability. The
JABOTABEK area, covered by the project, contributed almost 40% of all PLN's
revenues, at a relatively small proportion of the total cost.
3.03      Significant improvements were registered on training by consultants
(it3m 2.06(D)). In contrast to the dominant role of SOFRELEC, the consultant
on the earlier projects (Credits 165/334-IND), on this project the consultanc
discharged only an advisory function. This reflected the experience PLN had
already gained on the two earlier distribution projects and hastened its
progress towards self-sufficiency in the field of electricity distribution.
There were 20 expatriates on earlier projects. This project (Loan 1259-IND)
started with 6 expatriates in 1977. The number was reduced to two by 1978 and
the expatriates were eliminated by 1980. PLN is now well trained in the
construction and operation aspects of urban distribution as operational
results have borne out. On planning, design and procurement aspects also PLN
strengthened itself considerably as evidenced by its work on the distribution

components of follow-on power projects Eleven (Loan 2056-IND, FY82) and
Twelve (Loan 2300-IND, FY83).
Use and Performance of Consultants
3.04      The performance of the consultant was highly satisfactory.  As
explained in para. 3.03 the consultant's role on this project was advisory and
self-liquidatory. That these objectives were fulfilled in a short time is
complimentary to both PLN and the consultant.
Implementation Schedule
3.05      The task of implementation covers (a) equipment procurement,
including manufacture and delivery; and (b) their installation. In regard to
(a) experiences on the earlier projects (Credits 165/334) were taken into
account and somewhat speedier installation was assumed. The implementation
schedule agreed at appraisal provided that the equipment and materials
required for the project were to be procured in chree lots, che award of
contracts for each lot being finalized by end-Jtnuary 1977, end-August 1977
and end-March 1978 respectively. Shipment of all materials was planned to be
completed by June 1979. Completion of the installation was expected by March
1980. Due to factors explained in paras. 3.06-3.09 below, delivery of all
equipment was completed only in September 1981. Project construction was
completed 9 months later. The delay in completion was two years. It was due
mainly to procurement problems (paras. 3.07 to 3.09), and problems in land
acquisition for location of substations.
Procurement
3.06      In 1975 GOI had decreed that procurement of goods and services by
PLN financed through Government funds shall be undertaken by the Ministry
through a Joint Committee of representatives of PLN and the Ministry. Appre-
hensive of infringement of PLN's rights, during negotiations of the loan,
agreement was reached that Government involvement in PLN's procurement
activities would be limited to supervision of evaluation of bids. By and
large these covenanted assurances were fulfilled by GOI.
3.07      With minor exceptions, the contracts for each of the three lots of
equipments and materials (para. 3.05) were placed by PLN in July 1977, July
1978 and July 1979 respectively.  The delays ranged from 6 months for Lhe
first lot to 18 months for the third lot. The table below indicates that
there were substantial delays in the issue of bid documents.

3.           Dec 78        Feb 79         Jul 79             29        Jan-Dec 80
3.08      The intial delay in issue of bid documents was related to the
inordinate (3-1/2 year) delay in completion of the physical works of the
earlier distribution projects (Credits 165-IND and 334-IND) which had led to
overstocking of PLN's limited warehouse capacity.  Mobilization of workers for
the much larger construction prograci also took more time than planned. For
these reasons the first lot was delayed and limited to a value of $13.6
million. The scope of the second lot was substantially increased (to an
estimated value of $40.0 million) but there were significant reductions in
equipment prices (of the order of 30% during 1977-78) which reduced bid prices
for the second lot to $26.0 million. Special efforts were then made by PLN to
further strengthen its field organizations and augment its warehouse
capacities. It was possible to handle the balAr.xe of procurement under the
third lot and arrange for efficient erection of plant and equipment.
3.09      Compared to the first two distribution projects, where equipment wAs
received in PLN's warehouses within 18 months of the issue of tender
documents, there was an elapsed time varying from 20 months (Lot 3) to 24
months (Lot 4) under this project. Only 8 out of 72 contracts encountered
delays in supply by the manufacturers. The deterioration in implementation
has been attributed to the new administrative procedures set up by Government
for approval of awards, issuing letters of intent, negotiations of contracts
and issuing letters of credit. During 1980 Government responded to Bank
suggestions that substantial shortening of construction periods (of 6 months
or more) were possible and streamlined its procedures. However, the
establishment in 1982 of an overall CentraL Procurement Committee (SEKNEG) has
contributed to similar delays in subsequent distribution projects of this type
(Loan 2056-IND) also. An important lesson to be drawn from this project is
that improvements in the overall procurement cycle of power projects in
Indonesia are essential. However, as the entire Government system is
involved, remedial action has to be taken on Bank and country wide basis.
Performance of Suppliers and Contractors
3.10      Performance of suppliers and contractors was generally satisfactory
as most of the equipment ordered was delivered within the period stipulated.
There were delays, however, ranging from 3-12 months on some of the equip-
ments. On the first and second lots they were due to devaluation of the
Rupiah and the consequent need to amend some contracts designated in



-7-
Rupiahs. The maximum delay of 12 months was on medium voLtage (20 kV) metal
clad switchgear awarded to Alsthom of France under the third lot where
delivery was completed only by September 3L, 1981.
Project Cost
3.11      The cost of the project as implemented amounts to US$158.61 million,
of which 56% was in foreign exchange. The breakdown of costs at appraisal and
the actuals are given in the table below:
Table 3.3: PROJECT COST

3.18      A direct comparison of the appraisal and completion costs would not
be relevant in this case as it has been explained in paras. 2.07/2.08 that
there have been significant changes in the details of the project. Where
there have been no changes in scope of project components (e.g., service
entrances, voltage change over equipment) the lower actual foreign costs are
due to lower prices of equipment during 1977-79 (para. 3.08). The increases
on the foreign costs of other items (medium voltage systems, distribution
substations and low voltage systems) reflect the enlargement in scope and
increased quantities of materials and equipment (paras. 2.07, 2.08).
Engineering costs are lower for reasons explained in para. 3.03. Local costs
on the project increased about 40% after the major devaluation of the Rupiah
in 1978 (from Rp 415 to Rp 625 to the US$). Further, there were increases in
construction costs on account of the increases in scope of the medium voltage
system.



-8-
Financing
3.14      The Bank loan financed the full foreign costs of the project, as
impLemented. The unutilized portion of the bank loan - US$1.14 million - was
cancelled. PLN/GOI met the construction and other local costs.
Disbursements
3.15      The comparison between actual disbursement and the appraisal dis-
bursement schedule is shown in Annex 2. From this comparison it can be seen
that effective disbursements started a year later than envisaged and were
extended by a further twelve months. This was due to impLementation delays
explained in paras. 3.05 to 3.10.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Market Development and Performance
4.01      Power market studies carried out in Java during 1973-75 before the
project was commenced had shown that because of the severe past constraints on
growth of public electricty supply and rapid economic growth, PLN's sales
growth for 10-12 years ahead would not be determined by the potential market
but rather by its ability to expand its supply through construction of larger
and more efficient centra'l generating stations and adequate electricity
distribution systems. rn 1977, after years of stifled growth (of the order of
102 per year) PLN initiated a strong drive towards connections of new
consumers with sales gruwth targets above 20% p.a. in all areas where
restrictions could be removed. The results were impressive (para. 4.02).
4.02      The following growth indicators in the Jakarta area during the
period 1977-81 are illustrative:

-9-
Buildup of Capacity and Utilization
4.03      The benefits in the latter haLf of the period (1977-1981) are
largely attributable to the project. As the rate of growth continued unabated
even at the end of the period, in 1982 it became necessary to plan for a
further doubling of the distribution capacity in the project area by 1985. A
follow-on distribution reinforcement project - which would further double the
capacity in a 4 year period - was then prepared. A Bank loan of $170.0
million (2056-IND) was arranged in FY82 to finance its foreign exchange costs.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Financial Objectives
5.01      Under the Fifth Power Project (Loan 1259-IND, 1976), the Government
and PLN agreed: (a) to continue until 1978/79 to adhere to the targets of the
Firancial Recovery Plan (FRP) as adopted under the Third and the Fourth Power
Projects (Credit 399-IND, 1972 and Loan 1127-IND, 1975); and (b) to develop a
new system of financial performance targets to be used after the recovery.
5.02      The new system of financial performance targets for the period after
recovery was first established as agreed through a covenant under the Seventh
Power Project (Loan 1513-IND, 1978). A self-financing ratio (SFR) was then
adopted because of the desirability of financing, out of internal cash
generation, a reasonable proportion of PLN's investment program. The firmly
agreed SFR was 30X by 1985/86, with indicative targets for the intervening
years. They were, however, amended and reduced ';nder the Eighth (Loan 1708-
IND, 1979) and Twelfth (Loan 2214-IND, 1982) Power Projects.
Performance Results
5.03      The objective of the FRP for PLN to achieve a full revenue/cost
recovery was met in 1975/76, three years ahead of schedule and PLN was able to
continue to maintain a position slightly above breakeven in terms of operating
income through 1978/79. This satisfactory trend is shown in Table 5.1.
Table 5.1: PLN: REVENUE/COST RATIO
FY                  1974/75       1975/76     1976/77      1977/78    1978/79

5.04      The quantification of SFR indicative targets had been revised from
time to time to take into account significant changes in PLN's capital
expenditures and fuel costs. The SFR target for 1985/86 and onwards was
reduced from 30% to 20% under the Twelfth Power Project. A mechanism was



- 10 -
introduced at the same time to adjust the minimum indicative targets inversely
with any significant changes in PLN's capital expenditures and fuel costs.
PLN's financial performance in terms of cash generation is shown in Table
5.2.

/a   The percentage of PLN's capital expenditures for the target year plus the two
preceding years covered by its net revenue plus depreciation retentions less
debt service for the same three years.
5.05      PLN has been able to meet the revised minimum SFR targets mainly
because of: (a) high proportions of consumers' contributions and depreciation
in its internal resources; and (b) lower level of realized capital
expenditures in some of the earlier years than originally projected. However,
the total capital expenditures in constant 1975 prices over the decade
covering the two Five-year National Development Plans (REPELITA II and III,
1974175-1983/84) was very close to the appraisal projection for the Fifth
Power Project (Rp 2,044 billion actual against Rp 2,028 billion projected).
5.06      The financial projections in the appraisal report of the Project
were expressed in terms of constant 1975 prices. After adjustment for
inflation PLN's actual operating revenues increased, over the period 1975/76
through 1983/84, at 21% p.a. as against the projected 23% p.a. The increase
in operating expenses (with fuel costs adjusted separately for domestic fuel
price escalation) was about 16% p.a., as against the projected 21% p.a. The
lower actual operating expenses than the projections in terms of constant
prices could be explained partly by the lower sales in the last two years and
partly by the operating economies in recent years on the part of PLN. As
regards PLN's sales in GWh, the actual results were very close to the
projected sales until 1981/82. In 1982/83 and 1983/84, the actual sales were
about 12% and 19% lower than the projection mainly due to (a) delays in some
consumers connection program due to budget constraints; and (b) the economic
recession in the last few years leading to lower consumptions from existing
consumers. A comparison between the projected and actual results is
summarized in Annex 3, page 1. Detailed financial statements are given in
Annex 3, pages 2 to 4.



- 11 -
Tariffs
5.07      Because of the composition of PLN's generating capacity, fuel costs
account for nearly 60X of its total annual expenses. Fuel price increases
following GOI's policy of removing domestic oil subsidies significantly
increase PLN's operating expenses. The average fuel price paid by PLN
remained at about Rp 25/liter until 1978/79 and started to increase by about
30% in 1979/80, 40% in 1980181, 20% in 1982/83 and about 60% p.a. in 1983/84
and 1984/85.
5.08      While fuel prices increased significantly in recent years, PLN's
tariff remained unchanged until 1980/81, when PLN raised tariffs about 50% as
a condition of the Bank's assistance in the financing of the Ninth Power
Project (Loan 1872-IND, 1980). All tariff adjustments since 1980/81 were not
only intended merely to offset the fuel cost increases, but they also lagged
behind the fuel price adjustments. Consequently, PLN's tariffs were not
sufficient to cover the 4ull increases in its operating expenses, and actually
declined in real terms,-  resulting in operating losses in 1979/80, 1982/83
and 1983/84.
5.09      In May 1974, PLN instituted a mechanism of tariff surcharges,
through which adjustments of revenues were made possible. Repeated use of the
surcharge mechanism introduced distortion into the tariff structure. The
consequential pricing anomalies were rectified in the tariff revision of May
1980, which was based on the Long Run Marginal Cost (LRMC) pricing principles.
However, since 1980, all tariff increases have again been effected entirely
through changes only in the energy charges. The failure to adjust the demand
charges has thus re-introduced distortions in the tariff structure, that
couLd, inter aLia, lead to excessive growth of peak demand.
5.10      In 1983, an economist from the Bank visited PLN to assist in its
studies of costs and tariff structure. Based on the results of these studies,
PLN has agreed to revise its tariff structure to better reflect the LRMC of
electricity supply. The Bank's continued involvement in the Power sector and
its support in tariff studies has been an important contributing factor in
motivating PLN towards economic efficiency pricing.
Financial Management
5.11      The necessity to build in adjustments to modify the SFR targets and
the fact that PLN was able to meet the SFR covenant while its operations had
been incurring losses indicate that the SFR type of measure with the
covenanted levels is less appropriate from the viewpoint of financial
viability under PLU's circumstances now than six years ago. Under the
Fourteenth Power Project (June 1984), COI/PLN agreed to a rate of return
4/   The increases in tariff of about 33% and 35% in 1982/83 and 1983/84,
respectively, helped to raise PLN's average revenue in 1983/84 to about
Rp 27/kWh in constant 1975 prices, as compared with Rp 25/kWh in the
projections of the Project.



- 12 -
covenant with firm minimum targets of 6Z in 1985/86 and 8% from 1986/87
onwards. The SFR was retained as one of the performance indicators and will
be monitored regularly to ensure PLN's self financing capability. The
adoption of the ROR covenant with revaluation of assets is a significant step
forward in the reorientation of PLN's financial management and performance
monitoring.
5.12      Under the Fifth Power Project, two covenants were introduced to
ensure PLN's prudent debt management: (i) minimum future debt service
coverage of 1.0; and (ii) settlement of all its debts within one month when
due. These covenants were replaced under the Seventh Power Project by: (i)
minimum future debt service coverage of 1.3 times; and (ii) a debt/equity
ratio of 60/40. The Thirteenth Power Project (Loan 2300-IND, 1983) adopted
only one debt management covenant which requires a minimum of 1.5 times
coverage of future debt service each year out of the forecast internal funds
for that year; all references to the earlier covenants have been deleted.
This last change reflected the growing recognition by the Bank that the new
coverage is required for a growing company like PLN, and at the same time,
make allowance for the added future earning power. PLU has been complying
with these covenants.
5.13      PLN's collection performance has been generally satisfactory.  The
accounts receivable position of customers other than Government users has been
improved to abouc two months of billing. PLN's sales to Government users
account for about 10% of its total sales; but collections from some Government
users (including Army users and local governments) have not been promptly
settled when due.
5.14      The Government has taken various measures to correct the unsatisfac-
tory payment performance by Government users. Outstanding Government accounts
receivable were reduced from over one year in 1981/82 to about five months of
billing in 1982/83; this is still not considered satisfactory. An action plan
was agreed under the Fourteenth Power Project to further reduce the arrears.
rt was also agreed to amend the old covenant which would require each and all
Government users to pay their bills promptly to a more realistic covenant that
would require the amounts owed by all Government users in aggregate be kept to
less than two months of total billings for such users. PLN would also be
required under the new covenent to keep collection data for Government users
adequately disaggregated so that the source of any overdue payment problems
could be identified. This matter requires continuous attention and effort to
follow up in future.
5.15      PLN's accounts are required by its charter to be audited by
Goverment auditors. The audit reports are acceptable to the Bank, but are
subject to long delays. In 1983 special efforts were made by the Accounting
Department to expedite the closing of accounts within six months aftet the
close of the fiscal year as stipulated in PLN's charter. This was a signifi-
cant improvement. Government audit would normally take about 2-3 months. To
be more realistic and also in line with Government's regulations, the Bank's
audit submission covenant was amended under the Fourteenth Power Project from
six to nine months after the close of the fiscal year. PLN, however, will
submit its unaudited accounts to the Bank for early review and, as required of



- 13 -
all public corporations, to the Government for audit within six months of the
end of fiscal year.
6. JUSTIFICATION
Rate of Return
6.01      As the project was a time and area slice of a distribution system,
as well as being part rehabilitation and part expansion scheme, it was not
possible at appraisal to rationally allocate the increased sales and decreased
losses directly attributable to the project. Consequently an Economic Rate of
Return was not calculated for the project, at appraisal. The feasibility
study had, however, established that the distribution program was necessary
and that it was the most economical expansion scheme. The Internal Financial
Rate of Return (IFRR) for PLN's development program, of which the project was
an integral part, was estimated at appraisal at 112.
6.02      The IFRR for PLN's actual investment program, for the ten-year
period 1975/76 through 1984/85, is now estimated at about 6.7% using the
prevailing 1984/85 tariff. However, under the Fourteenth Power Project, PLN
agreed to achieve a ROR of at Least 6Z in 1985/86 and at least 8Z in 1986/87
and thereafter. This would require a tariff increase in 1985/86 of about 16X
from the prevailing average tariff, maintained in real terms thereafter.
Using these new tariffs, the IFRR is re-estimated at about 9.8% (Annex 4).
This re-estimated IFR  is reasonable, though it is slightly lower than the
appraisat estimate - for the following reasons: While PLN's realized capital
expenditures followed closely the projections, its sales had been lower than
the appraisal estimates, due partly to delays in consumers' connection program
in recent years as a result of budget constraints, and partly to the economic
recession in the last two to three years. In addition, PLN's tariff was not
adjusted between 1975/76 and 1979/80, resulting in a decline in reaL terms
until 1983/84. If average revenues had been maintained in real terms at the
levels prevailing in 1975/76 as given in the Appraisal Report, the IFRR would
have been 10.2%.
6.03      The fact that consumption continued to grow at a significant rate
and a considerable amount of industrial consumption involved more expensive
captive power suggest an unusually large component of consumers' surplus,
particularly in industrial consumption.
5/   These two rates may not be strictly comparable as the appraisal estimate
might be for the investment program of a shorter period. This is not
clear in the SAR.

VII. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Organizational Improvements
7.01      The initiatives taken by the Bank Group in the context of credits
165 and 334 to address institutional deficiencies of PLN were described in
PPAR 2741 in November 1979. They comprised a new constitutional basis for
PLN's operations and extensive management consultancy services mainly for
improvement of its accounting systems. Further institutional development
measures, including a Financial Recovery Program, and extensive training
programs, and fellowships were implemented under the third and fourth power
loans (339-IND and 1127-IND). These have been described in PPAR 5104 of May
1984. The main thrust of the fifth operation, on the institutional
development side was to: (a) consolidate the measures already initiated
earlier; (b) review progress of development of a new internal reorganization
of PLN's operations introduced in September 1975; and (c) decrease dependence
on outside consultants and move towards greater self-sufficiency.
Growth of PLN
7.02      During the period 1972-77, PLN had given precedence to rehab-
ilitation of its distribution systems, augmenting its generating capacity, and
establishing proper financial management systems. Sales grew at a steady
annual race of 12% while privately owned captive plants grew at a higher rate
(15-20%). The initial part of the forecast period of this, the fifth,
operation (1978-82) witnessed an intensive campaign of growth mounted by
PLN. It connected consumers at the rate of half a million every year and its
sales grew annually at 22%. Access to service increased by 50% and growth of
uneconomic captive plants in the country was halted. Performance indicators
such as the number of consumers per employee and the energy sold per employee
improved though the organizational strength had increased from about 2000 in
1976 to about 32,000 in 1982. In this period the rate of capital investment
doubled and PLN began to implement major development schemes such as the 800
MW Suralaya thermal station, the 700 MW Saguling hydroelectric project and the
500 kV Java Grid. These are evidences of strong institutional development in
the period covered by this report.
Impact of Consultants
7.03      As expected, outside management consultants were withdrawn in
1976. PLN largely drew on its own resources for its further institutional
growth. As explained at paras. 3.03 and 3.04, under this project PLN rapidly
developed the technical expertise needed to plan construct and operate its
distribution systems.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
Overall Assesment
8.01      The project achieved all its major objectives and helped promote the
institutional development of Indonesia's power sector.



- 15 -
Lessons for Similar Projects
8.02      The increase in the period of about 4 months in the overall period
of procurement of equipment compared with the experience of the earlier dis-
tribution project, (para. 3.09) is a reflection of the complexities of
Government procedures introduced for award of contracts and issuance of
letters of credits. One would normally have expected a reduction of about 4-6
months in this period in view of the expertise PLN had gained. Improvements
in the overall procurement cycle of major power projects are essential to the
further progress of PLN and the power sector but as the entire Government
system, including che Central Procurement Committtee (SEKNEG) is now involved,
this improvement can only be expected through Bank and countrywide efforts
(para. 3.09).
8.03      The Bank's approach in designing measures to monitor PLN's financial
performance has been reasonable and flexible. In retrospect, the SFR covenant
had made its contribution in ensuring a minimum level of PLN's self financing
capabilities. But, with the flexibility of short-term indicative (rather than
firm) targets and the subsequent lowering of the target levels, the SFR
covenant was .ior able to safeguard PLN's financial operations and indirectly
contributed to the financial weakness that PLN began to experience in recent
years (paras. 5.08 and 5.11). This is explained partly by the inadequate
tariff adjustments and partly by PLN's lumpy investment and the uncertainty in
international fuel price movements. The adoption of the ROR covenant with
firm targets and the retention of SFR as criterion for regular monitoring
would enable PLN to achieve a reasonable return from its operations and, at
the same time, maintain satisfactory cash generation levels.
