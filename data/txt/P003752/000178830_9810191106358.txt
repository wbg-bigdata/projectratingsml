PERUSAHAAN UMUM LISTRIK NEGARA (PLN)
APPRAISAL OF THE FIFTH POWER PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Fifth Power Project is part of PLN's ongoing West Java/
Jakarta distribution rehabilitation and expansion program which started
with the help of Credits 165 and 334-IND, both of which will be fully
committed during 1976. The foreign exchange cost of the FY1977-1983
portion of the program is estimated at US$244 million equivalent of which
US$90 million equivalent (about 37%) is proposed for Bank financing.
Recently the Kuwait Development Fund has expressed interest in contribut-
ing about US$40 million which, should it materialize, would increase the
committed foreign financing for the program to about 53%.
ii.       The total cost of the proposed Project amounts to US$164 million.
The Project scope includes part of the highest priority items necessary during
FY 1977-1980 to market the output of generating facilities already committed.
iii.      The Project justification rests on the economics of having a reli-
able power supply as well as uniform voltage supply levels throughout the
area, and the need for expanding service to consumers and areas presently
not served. Given the difficulties associated with quantifying the benefits
accruing to a slice of an ongoing distribution construction program, no
internal economic rate of return has been calculated. The internal finan-
cial rate of return of PLN's development program is at least 11%.
iv.       Procurement of the equipment financed from the proceeds of the
proposed Loan will be in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. With prior
Bank agreement, the procurement of items costing less than US$50,000 equiva-
lent, up to an aggregate of US$500,000, may be permitted without international
competitive bidding. Local preference in bid evaluation will apply. Since
negotiations with the engineering consultants have not been concluded, satis-
factory contractual arrangements between PLN and the consultant are a condi-
tion of Loan effectiveness.
v.        Since its involvement with the Indonesian power sector the Bank
Group has paid particular attention to PLN's independence in procurement
matters.  A recent Government decree appeared to transfer responsibility for
all procurement of goods financed from the Government budget from PLN back to
the Government. This would have been undesirable in light of the importance
attached by the Bank to concentrating procurement, construction and operation
of power facilities within one responsible entity. However, assurance was
obtainedduring negotiations that the Government involvement in the procurement
activities of PLN will be limited to supervision of the evaluation of bids
received by PLN for goods or services financed from funds of the national
budget.



- ii-
vi.       So far PLN has adhered to the targets included in the Financial
Recovery Plan (Credit 399 and Loan 1127-IND) and prospects are good that
it will continue to do so. Consequently, the revenue/cost targets of 90%
in 1976/77 and 100% in 1978/79 have been repeated in the documents of the
proposed Loan. Furthermore, the Government and PLN have agreed to develop
a system of financial performance targets which, after concurrence by the
Bank, would be used after financial recovery to measure PLN's financial
performance.
vii.      The proposed Loan would be made to the Government and onlent to
PLN on the same terms, with Government bearing the foreign exchange risk
and the interest and commitment charges.

APPRAISAL OF THE FIFTH POWER PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Indonesia has requested financial assistance
for a distribution rehabilitation and expansion program of the West Java
and Jakarta area during the period FYs 1977-1983. The foreign exchange
cost for this program is estimated at US$244 million. The proposed Project
with an estimated total cost of US$164 million will cover the highest prior-
ity requirements in the area during FYs 1977-1980. A Bank loan of US$90
million is proposed to cover the foreign exchange cost, for a term of 25
years including 5 years of grace. The Loan will be granted to the Government
which will onlend it to Perusahaan UJmum Listrik Negara (PLN), the Beneficiary,
on Bank loan terms. Recently the Kuwait Development Fund has expressed
interest in contributing about US$40 million equivalent to the program,
raising the committed foreign financing to about 53% of the program.
1.02      The Loan would be the fifth Bank Group operation in the power
sector with PLN the Beneficiary in all cases. The first two credits (165
and 334 IND) were made to help finance the first phase of rehabilitation
and expansion of the Jakarta electric distribution system and Credit 339-IND
and Loan 1127-IND contributed to the construction of units, 1, 2 and 3 of
the Muara Karang steam plant in Jakarta.
1.03      All three Credits and the Loan provided for extensive institu-
tion building aimed at making PLN a sound public utility. Funds were made
available for consultants in the fields of management and accounting im-
provement, drafting laws and accounting systems, maintenance and operation
manuals, training of personnel as well as an organized system of activities
aimed at leading PLN to financial recovery by fiscal year 1978/79. Addi-
tional funds were provided for feasibility studies and for the Java System
Development Study which will guide the future power development of Java.
1.04      The management consulting effort has, on balance, been successful
and the progress achieved is encouraging. The FY 1975 revenue/cost ratio
target of 80% has not only been achieved but surpassed and expectations
are that full financial recovery as required by Loan and Credit covenants
will be attained in FY 1979. During FY 1977 discussions will be held with
the Indonesian authorities on the financial targets to be reached after
financial recovery.
1.05      This report was prepared by Messrs. J. Carver and  K. Stichenwirth
and is based on information obtained during a mission to Indonesia in
November/December 1975.

II. THE POWER SECTOR
2.01      The public power sector is synonymous with PLN, a Governiment-owned
enterprise, responsible for generation, transmission and distribution through-
out the country. It was created in 1965 through the merger of three national-
ized utilities which had succeeded Dutch-owned private electricity corpora-
tions.
2.02      Although PLN has the exclusive right to generate, transmit and
distribute electric power, companies or individuals are allowed to build and
operate generating stations for their own supply if PLN is unable to provide
service. In special cases, these auto-producers are allowed to distribute
electricity to consumers in surrounding areas.
2.03      Inadequate and unreliable public power supply has resulted in
many captive plant installations, representing an estimated 40% of the
total installed capacity. These installations represent uneconomic
investments, as small captive generating stations cannot compete in
capital cost or operating efficiency with larger central stations. Also,
the diversity factor is lost, so that more capacity must be installed in
captive plants than would be required in an interconnected system.
Existing Public Power Facilities
2.04      PLN's total installed capacity on March 31, 1975, was 1,047 MW
(including the 125 MW Juanda hydro plant owned by the Jatiluhur Authority
from which PLN purchases the output). Including Juanda, it consisted of
39% hydro, 24% steam, 25% diesel and 12% gas turbine capacity. These in-
stallations are scattered throughout the country in small units and stations,
with the largest plant, the 150 MW Tanjung Priok steam station in Jakarta,
composed of 2 x 25 MW and 2 x 50 MW units. Details on installed capacity are
given in Annex 1 and on peak demand, generation and sales in Annex 2.
2.05      Transmission and distribution facilities are inadequate.  Major
load centers are not interconnected, resulting in high production costs
and poor reliability. There exist approximately 3,100 km of lines ranging
from 25 KV to 150 KV and about 1,500 MVA of transformer capacity.
Sector Development
2.06      Past sector development was largely determined by the foreign
assistance available. Consequently, it was not always rational and system
standardization suffered. An example is the distribution systems of West
and Central Java as presently under construction. West Java will have a
European standard of 20 KV medium voltage, three-phase distribution trans-
formers and a 220/380 volt, three-phase, low voltage system. Central Java
will have an American standard of 23 KV medium voltage, single-phase distribu-
tion transformers, and 220/440 volt, single-phase, low-voltage systems.
The systems are not completely compatible. Further problems will occur
in transmission because of differences in relaying and grounding practices of
American and European standards.



2e07      With funds provided from Credit 399-IND, consultants (Preece,
Cardew and Rider) were selected for a system development study for the
island of Java. They started work in November 1974 and the final report
should be ready in July 1976. Under a French credit a similar study is
being made for the island of Sumatra. The objective of these two studies
i s to provide guidelines for future power development and to establish
an appropriately balanced sector investment program.
The Power Market
2.08      Power sector development has suffered both financial and imple-
mentation constraints resulting in suppressed demand and power shortages.
For instance, it has been estimated that for the island of Java during
FY 1975 the following condition existed:
MW          % of Total
PLN Supplied                        447            50*0
Voltage Restriction                 110            12.3
On-Peak Restriction                 105            11.7
Waiting List                         58             6.5
Self-Supplied                       175            19.5
Underlying Demand La                895           100.0
/a   Demand PLN would have served if its installations
had been adequate.
Above table indicates that PLN was able to supply only about 50% of
the underlying demand in 1975.
2.09      Development of electricity sales in the public sector has varied
among the supply regions. West Java, where the proposed Project is located,
accounts for about 50% of the total market. Past results are summarized
below:
Total Indonesia                          West Java
Sales (GWR)  Annual Increase (%)    Sales (GWI)  Annual Increase (%)
1969        1,454               21                   695                29
1970        1,589                9                   773                1
1971        1,786                12                  898                16
1972        1,893                 6                  960                 7
1973        2,175                15                1,144                19
1974/75    2,444                 10                1,281                 9
The low sales increase in 1972 was caused by a low-water year for hydro-
electric power prcductcin and generation failures, and in 19714175 by systera
inability to serve the market.



2.10      On March 31, 1975, the number of customers supplied by PLN was
1,086,105 of which 90% were residential. The distribution of sales by
customer classes is shown in Annex 3.
Development Plan
2.11      The Java System Development Study presently under preparation by
Preece, Cardew and Rider examines two load forecasts:
(i) growth rates of approximately 21% per year during the
Second Five-Year Development Plan FY 1975-1979 (Repelita
II) and 15% during Repelita III (FY 1980-1984) starting
from the underlying demand level in FY 1975; and
(ii)  a lower projection, assuming a three-year continuous lag
in PLN's ability to satisfy the underlying demand during the
decade 1975-1984. This lag is based on the assessment of
PLN's financial and physical capabilities in implementing
its expansion program.
2.12      The load forecast used in this report is based on the lower pro-
jection and is assumed to apply to all of Indonesia.  To meet it, the follow-
ing investments would be required during Repelitas II and III (expressed
in 1975 equivalent dollars - for details see Annex 4 and 5):
Repelita II    Repelita III        Total
(FY 1975-1979) (FY 1980-1984) (FY 1975-1984)
----------------- US$ million-----------------
Foreign Cost                            1,136.5         2,170.4        3,306.9
Local Cost                                581.9         1,182.1        1,764.0
Total                       1,718.4         3,352.5        5,070.9
This investment program would add 4,Z32 MW to the existing 922 MW of PLN's
generating capacity as well as the transmission and distribution facilities
necessary to market the energy.
2.13      Despite reduction of the investment program to meet the lower
projection (para 2.11 (ii)), the forecast investments are still high. 1/ The
generation expansion program takes into account projects for which foreign
exchange financing was arranged by December 1975, and what appears to be the
most logical sequence thereafter.  By end-1975, foreign financing of about 85%
(US$985 million) of the investments to be executed during Repelita II was
secured. PLN's capability to raise the local funds depends largely on the
1/   PLN's own investment plan is considerably larger.



-5-
Government priorities applied in allocating budget funds to the various
sectors of the economy. In the past the power sector was given high priority
in budget allocations and budget cutbacks were not as drastic as in other
sectors. Consequently, the projected investment program for Repelita II
appears feasible. The planned investments during Repelita III will require
continued access to foreign exchange borrowings on reasonable terms and
increased internal cash generation.
2.14      Even after investment of US$5 billion, the level of public power
development will remain low as the following table illustrates:
Fiscal Year                                  1974        1979       1984
Estimated Population (million)                130        146         163
Installed Capacity (MW)                       917      2,404        5,155
Generation (GWh)                            2,932      5,970       16,410
Sales (GWh)                                 2,175      4,500       12,900
Losses and Station Use (%)                     25.8       24.6         21.4
Number of Customers (thousand)              1,031      1,450        2,600
Installed Capacity per Capita (watts)           7         16           32
Sales per Capita (kWh per year)                17         31           79
Inhabitants per Customer                      126        101           63
The very high ratio of inhabitants per customer indicates the low level of
electrification. On a developed system with rural electrification completed,
the ratio would be between 5 and 10.
III. THE BENEFICIARY
Background
3.01      Although created in 1965, PLN's corporate existence is based on
the 1972 Electricity Act which was issued as Presidential Decree No. 18/1972
(Annex 6). In addition, a number of decrees interpret or amend the basic
Act. They are not only used to clarify issues not sufficiently treated in the
existing laws but also to regulate managerial and operational responsibilities.
3.02      The Electricity Act, which was drafted with the assistance of
SOFRELEC, PLN's management and distribution engineering consultant, was
originally aimed at creating an autonomous public utility which would be fully
responsible for all its activities. This was considered important because
PLN functioned as a Government agency reporting to the Directorate General of
Eilectric Power, a Department of the Ministry of Public Works and Electric
Power. PLN's responsibilities were ill-defined and consisted in fact only
of day-to-day operations. Important matters such as system planning, con-
struction, procurement and finance were the responsibility of the Directorate,
relegating PLN's management to a secondary role.



- -, -
3.03      However, during the discussions on the Act it became clear that
the Government preferred a partially rather than fully autonomous body since
total autonomy would have been inconsistent with its policy of controlling
important sectors of the economy. Consequently, it was agreed that the Govern-
ment would retain responsibility for matters affecting the national economy--
for instance tariffs and investment planning, and overall control--and PLN
would be charged with all aspects of power development and operation. The
Directorate General of Electric Power was abolished.
Procurement Procedures
3.04      In reviewing the Electricity Act, the Bank Group gave particular
attention to PLN's independence in procurement matters. This was essential in
light of the importance attached by the Bank to concentrating procurement,
construction and operation of power facilitles within one technically qualified
and responsible entity and also to overcoming previous inordinate delays in
bid evaluation and contract award. Consequently, Article 8(b) of the 1972 Act
clearly states PLN's responsibility to:
"construct and operate future generating plants and power
networks, including the necessary procurement, in accordance
with sound commercial and industrial practices."
3.05      In the course of PLN's most recent reorganization (paras. 3.10-
3.13) the Minister for Public Works and Electric Power decreed (Article 29 -
Decree No. 12/PRT/1975):
"the procurement of goods and services for PLN, both from domestic
and foreign suppliers, financed from funds of the Government
budget shall be undertaken by the Ministry through a Joint
Committee consisting of representatives of PLN and the Ministry."
3.06      The new decree empowers the Government to take charge of all pro-
curement for power and, if applied to the full extent, would reinstate the
undesirable situation prevailing before 1972 with important responsibilities
split between the Government and PLN. However, during negotiations, assur-
ance was obtained that the latest decree was meant to streamline and tighten
control over Government-owned enterprises and departments, and that Govern-
ment involvement in the procurement activities of PLN would be limited to
supervision of the evaluation of bids recieved by PLN for goods or services
financed from funds of the national budget.
Legal Status and Responsibilities
3.07      PLN is a public enterprise (Perum).  It is the executing agency
of the Ministry for power development throughout the country, carrying out
its objectives within the National Development Program in accordance with
Government policies.
3.08      The Minister of Public Works and Electric Power determines PLN's
policy and exercises general control over its activities. He is assisted



-7-
by an Advisory Board consisting of the Ministers of Finance, Industry, and
National Development Planning (Chairman of BAPPENAS) in deciding on import-
ant matters.
?0o9      PLN is responsible for construction and operation of power facil-
ities throughout the country, drafting of power development plans, drafting of
regulations on standardization' safety and licensing of captive plant, and
entering into contracts for purchase or sale of electricity. It is also in
charge of research activities in the field of electric power and of organizing
personnel training. Its draft regulations must be approved and made public by
the Government to gain legal force.
Organization and Management
3.10      Effective September 9, 1975 PLN adopted a new organization scheme
(Annex 6) I/ which introduced three operational levels:
(i) leadership level;
(ii)  supporting services; and
(iii)  execution level.
The leadership level, comprising the management together with the deputy
directorships, is responsible for overall planning and guidance, data
collection, and central accounting and budgeting. It also maintains contact
with all Government agencies.   In the field of construction it reviews the
bidding documents and decides on contract awards for major projects (see
also para 3.06). The supporting services consist of the power research
center and the training center. The executing level includes the regional
offices for operation as well as for construction, called Special Projects.
The regional offices are responsible for all activities within their respect-
ive areas, including minor construction. Special project units are estab-
lished as and when the need arises to carry out projects too large or too
important to be handled by the regional offices.
3.11      PLN's management (Board of Directors) consists of a President
Director and at least two other Directors. In addition to the President
Director, there are presently five, responsible for planning, operation,
construction, finance and administration (including personnel). The members
of the Board are appointed and dismissed by the President of Indonesia upon
recommendation by the Minister. They normally serve a five-year term, but
may be reappointed. The President Director is responsible to the Minister
and the Directors report in their respective fields to the President
Director.
3.12      PLN's middle management (deputy directors and chiefs of support-
ing services as well as executing level) is appointed by the Minister upon
1i   Decree No. 135PRT/1975 of the Minister of Public Works and Electric
Power.



-8-
recommendation of the Board. The deputy directors are responsible to the
directors in their respective fields whereas the chiefs report to the
entire Board.
3.13      The new organization appears effective in transferring the respon-
sibility for day to day operation and construction implementation to the
regional managers. This is particularly important in light of the large
area PLN has to cover and the long distances involved. However it places
a large work load on the Board of Directors who are collectively responsible
for solving the problems brought to their attention. Before the latest re-
organization, matters of lesser importance were "filtered" through deputy
directors who could deal with them within their own sphere of influence.
However, in general, the organization seems appropriate for PLN consider-
ing the limited reservoir of qualified staff available.
3.14      As of March 1975 PLN had a total staff of 20,300.  Although the num-
ber of employees is high in comparison with its activities, a severe shortage
of qualified personnel still prevails.  For instance, PLN's personnel upgrad-
ing program would require more civil and electro-mechanical engineers annually
than are presently graduating from all the technical universities in the coun-
try. PLN tries to overcome this problem through in-house training (training
programs have been developed by SOFRELEC), fellowships and overseas training
(in part financed from Loan 1127). However, considering the magnitude of the
task involved, slow progress must be expected.
Management Consulting Effort
3.15      The management consulting effort financed by the Bank Group has been
described and evaluated in detail in a number of earlier reports 1/. Con-
sequently, this report provides only information on the background and pre-
sent status of the activities.
3.16      At the time of the Bank Group's first involvement in the power sector
(1969) PLN was clearly in a chaotic state. Plant was inadequate, as were oper-
ating and maintenance techniques; staff efficiency, pay and morale were low;
plant construction as well as purchasing were outside management's control;
and accounting and other records were either inadequate or nonexistent.
3.17      To remedy the situation, the Bank Group helped finance through Cred-
its 165 and 334-IND a comprehensive management consulting effort, for which

-9-
the French firm of SOFRELEC, assisted in accounting matters by Peat, Marwick
and Mitchell of the UK, was selected. The consultants' first task was to lay
the ground work on which improvement activities could be based. Records had
to be reconstructed and assets physically identified; large outstanding con-
sumer accounts had to be verified and means found for their settlement; a
new tariff, a charter for PLN and various manuals for plant operation and
maintenance had to be designed. This initial phase took about two years.
3.18      At the time of appraisal for Credit 399-IND in late 1972 PLN's
problems were identified and recommendations for their solution were in
hand.  This, together with PLN's unfavorable financial situation, led to
the agreement on a program of measures designed to improve PLN's manage-
ment capabilities and to overcome its financial weaknesses with time. This
program, together with financial interim targets (para 6.01), was made a
part of the documents of Credit 399-IND (Financial Recovery Plan).
3.19      The efforts made to date to turn PLN into a sound public utility
have yielded positive results as well as temporary lack of success. Progress
in the field of finance and accounting has been excellent. Good results
have been accomplished in operations (thermal plant operation and maintenance
procedures). Both achievements are due to the intensive training program
initiated by SOFRELEC. Progress in planning and project implementation,
however, is slow. It is particularly in this field where PLN's severe shortage
in qualified personnel is most apparent. PLN's management and SOFRELEC are
continuing to pay particular attention to improving these activities.
3.20      Present plans envisage a gradual withdrawal of the management con-
sultants during 1976, and replacement with about 5-7 individual advisers who
will be attached to the various departments. Financing fcr these advisers
has been provided in Loan 1127-IND.
IV. THE PROJECT
4.01      Credits 165 and 334-IND were intended to help finance the first
five years of a program to rehabilitate and expand the distribution system
of Jakarta and to provide engineering services, training and management con-
sulting services. Commitments under these two credits will be completed
during 1976 and with the continued rapid growth of the Jakarta area funds for
further rehabilitation and expansion of the distribution systems are required.
Project Description
4.02      The Indonesian authorities submitted for Bank assistance a power
distribution rehabilitation and expansion program covering PLN's require-
ments in the West Java and Jakarta area between 1977-1983. The foreign
exchange cost of this program is estimated at US$244 million. The proposed
Project, with an estimated total cost of US$164 million, of which US$90 mil-
lion is the foreign exchange cost, includes high priority items to implement
part of the program during the period FYs 1977-1980. Recently the Kuwait



- 10 -
Development Fund has expressed interest in contributing about US$40 million,
an amount which could be absorbed during FYs 1977-1980 through the purchase of
equally high priority items. However, decision on the Kuwait participation
cannot be expected before end-1976. Consequently, the details of work to be
accomplished as included for illustration purposes in Annex 7 are shown
without Kuwait participation. Adjustments will occur should Kuwait decide to
contribute.
4.03       Medium voltage (MV) systems will be standardized at 20 KV als the
12 KV and 6 KV systems are gradually phased out. The low voltage (LV)
systems will be standardized at 220/380 volts instead of the existing
127/220 volt systems. These voltages were selected as the most economical
through studies made previously. The 150/20 KV and 70/20 KV substations re-
quired for support of the Project are being provided under schemes being
financed from other sources.
4.04       The installed generating capacity in West Java was 445 MW with a
peak demand of 292 MW for the year ending March 31, 1975. These will in-
crease to 1,220 MW and approximately 755 MW for the year ending March 31,
1980. Part of this increase of system peak (463 MW) will be absorbed by
the distribution systems and high tension customers, and part by the pro-
posed Project.
Cost Estimate
4.05       The Project cost estimate is detailed in Annex 7 and summarized
below.  The cost estimate and bill of materials were prepared by PLN with
the assistance of its engineering consultant SOFRELEC.

4.06      The basic prices were determined from material and construction costs
for ongoing distribution projects during 1975.  Physical contingencies of 10%
are included to allow for unforeseen events. Price contingencies of 12%-8%-8%-8%
per year on foreign costs and 20% per year on local costs have been included
to cover price increases during the construction period. The overall price
contingencies amcunt to 38% of the basic cost of the project including physical
contingencies.
Atmount of thle Loan
4.07      The proposed Loan of US$90 million equivalent will cover thie foreign
exc1;.ange cos'- (55% of the total Project cost) of materials, equipmnent and en-
gineering consulting services.  Financing of construction costs is not propcsec.



- 12 -
Engineering and Construction
4.08      The consultants (SOFRELEC) will continue to assist PLN in design,
preparation of bid documents, award of contracts, supervision of construction
and further training of the PLN work forces. PLN and SOFRELEC estimate that
490 man-months of field and head office time costing US$3.6 million equivalent
will be requiired by the foreign consultant and that the maximum number of per-
sonriel assigned at any time will be 12.  Either a new contract between PLN and
SOFLRELEC will be negotiated or an extension of the existing contract wi11 be
arranged. In either case, Bank approval will be required and Loan effective-
ness will depend on the finalizing of the contract.
4,09      The estimated man-month cost for the foreign consultants averages
about US$7,300 including salary, overhead and fee, which appears high for the
type of assistance required. However, even had negotations takeni place
with other consultants and a more favorable price been received, PLN judged
that SOFRELEC's familiarity with the Project and with PLN's procedures would
miore than compensate any apparent savings.  An allied consideration was that
SOFRELEC is to coritinue with training activities aimed at making PLN self-
sufficient for normal distribution construction in the future.  Nevertheless,
PLN was urged during nregotiations to attempt to reduce the consultants charges
when the contract is discussed, Although 490 man-months have been allowed for
in the cost estimate, actual requirements will be continually reviewed during
Project execution and reductions made as PLN's capabilities increase.
4.10      The Project will be constructed by PLN's force assisted by local
contractors. These forces have been trained under Credits 165 and 334 and
the proposed Project is a continuation of the same type of work. Additional
work forces for the expansion to the other areas outside of Jakarta will re-
ceive classroom training in existing training centers and on the job training.
Procurement
4.11      Equipment and materials to be financed through the proposed Loan
will be procured in accordance with the Bank Guidelines. With prior agreement
of the Bank contracts with a value of less than US$50,000 each, up to an
aggregate of US$500G000, may be petmitted without full international competi-
tive bidding. Some participation by Indonesian manufacturers is envisaged, in
which case a 15% preference on the c.i.f. price, or the prevailing duties, if
lower, will be applicable.
Disbursement
4.12      Disbursement of the proposed Bank loan would cover:
(a)  100% of the foreign exchange cost of all imported material
and equipment or 95% of the ex-factory cost of locally
manufactured material and equipment; and
(b)  10C% of the foreign exchange cost of the consultant.



- 13 -
The estimated disbursement and implementation schedules are attached in
Annex 7.
Ecology
4.13      No ecological problems arise in connection with the Project.  In
congested areas, the medium voltage system (20 KV) will be underground with
transformers located in kiosks and the low voltage system (220/380 volts)
generally overhead. In less congested areas, both systems will be overhead
with the transformers mounted on poles.
V. JUSTIFICATION
5.01      Access to electricity in the Project area is very restricted and the
quality of service is poor. There are about 44 persons per customer in the
urban area of Jakarta and about 87 in the remainder of West Java. Accordingly,
many industries, commercial establishments and even households generate their
own power in an uneconomical manner. Part of the problem has been lack of
generation and transmission, but the major problem has been, and remains,
antiquated and inadequate distribution. Ongoing projects will eliminate the
shortage of generation/transmission facilities and also have started distribu-
tion rehabilitation and expansion (in particular Credits 165 and 334-IND) in
Jakarta. This distribution effort has to be continued to market the output of
generation facilities presently under construction. Rehabilitation of the
existing 6 KV and 127/220 volt systems is urgently required. They are com-
pletely overloaded with voltage drops as high as 40% and with the average
customer receiving voltage 20% below normal.
5.02      The Project is a time slice as well as an area slice of the distri-
bution system requirements of West Java. The peak load on the distribution
systems involved will increase from 234 MW (1974) to approximately 463 MW
(1980), an increase of 229 MW. A total of 123,500 customers will be changed
from 127 to 220 volt service and 140,100 new customers will be connected. In
addition, 222 connections to private substations of large customers will have
been provided (Annex 7).
5.03      In previous studies it was determined that distribution systems
using 20 KV for medium voltage and 220/380 volt for low voltage were the
most economical for expansion of the distribution systems in West Java.
The present project continues the same trend, the only modification being
that more overhead lines and pole-mounted transformers are involved as parts
of the Project cover less congested areas.
5.04      As the Project is a time and area slice of various distribution
systems as well as being part rehabilitation and part expansion, it is
impossible to rationally allocate the increased sales and decreased losses
directly attributable to the Project. Part of the demand increase (229 MW)
will be absorbed by the distribution expansion financed by Credits 165 and
334-IND, part by customer-financed expansion and part by the present Project.
Consequently, no attempt has been made to calculate an internal economic rate



- 14 -
of return for the Project. However, the internal financial rate of return of
PLN's development program is at least 11%. This return would be higher
if it were possible to further reduce system losses and to increase sales
with the same investments.
VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
General
6.01      The objective of the Financial Recovery Plan (para 3.18) is to
achieve full revenue/cost coverage 1/ in FY1979, with interim targets of 80%
and 90% in FYs 1975 and 1977.  Progress in meeting this objective is so far
good, with better than the 80% target met in FY 1975.
6.02      With financial recovery on schedule, the next step is to agree
on the financial targets PLN should reach after FY 1979. Therefore, during
appraisal PLN was informed of the Bank's general approach in maintaining the
financial viability of public utilities, the targets used and the techniques
followed in measuring them. A summary of the Bank's policies in this respect
will be supplied to the Government and PLN.
6.03      Consequently, the Government and PLN have agreed during negotia-
tions:
(i)  to continue to adhere to the targets of the Financial
Recovery plan included in earlier documents (para 6.01);
and
(ii)  in consultation with the Bank, to develop by March 31, 1977,
or such later date as the Bank may agree, a system of financial
performance targets which would be used after financial
recovery to measure PLN's financial performance.
1/   Revenues from sales of power plus other operating revenues divided by
operating expenses including expenses for operation, maintenance,
administration as well as depreciation, allowance for bad debts, and
interest and similar charges on debt, if any.

6.05      Although the data used above is not fully reliable prior to 1973,
it nevertheless provides an appreciation of the situation before the intro-
duction of the recovery plan and the progress made in FY 1975. Operating
revenues covered only slightly more than cash expenses and the apparently
high ratio of investment financed through internal sources resulted from the
absence of any debt service and a small investment program.



- 16 --
6.06      PLN has exceeded the 80% revenue/cost target in FY 1975, reaching
97%.  However, this apparently favorable result was due to the following
reasons:
(i)  maintenance expenses were less than they should have been
because of a serious shortage of trained maintenance per-
sonnel; and
(ii)  depreciation was less than it would have been had assets
been properly revalued. Since the last revaluation in 1971,
assets are probably now understated by about 20% because of
inflation.
The additional operating charges because of these two factors would have
amounted to about Rp 5 billion, resulting in a revenue/cost ratio of 86%,
still above the target level.
6.07      The Financial Recovery Plan concentrates on PLN reaching a break-
even point, where operating revenues cover operating expenses. It does not
specify financial targets to be applied after recovery. This, together with
the lack of a domestic capital market and of government policies on power
sector finanicing require more than the normal assumptions in projecting PLN's
financial position after the recovery period. In addition, a number of
financial parameters are not yet defined. The financing plan presented below
assumes that:
(i) operating and investment expenditures are based on 1975
prices and no future escalation has been assumed. This
is appropriate since PLN's tariff schedule permits
inflationary cost increases to be passed on through
surcharges (para 6.13);
(ii)  sales of electricity follow the low forecast based
on the Java System Study (para 2.11);
(iii)  tariffs (and revenues) will be increased gradually from
the 1975 level so as to reach a return on average net
fixed assets in operation of about 7% by FY1986 to
permit, on average, a net internal cash generation
of about 30% of capital investments;
(iv)  the foreign component of future capital investments will
be financed entirely through borrowing, on terms of 22
years with a 4-year grace period, and average interest
at 9% per year.  During the grace period interest will be
financed; and
(v) the local component of capital investments, as far as
not covered through internal cash generation will be
financed through Government equity contributions.

6.09      Above table and Annex 8 show that the planned investment program
would increase by 1984 PLN's total net fixed assets about 7.2 times compared
to the 1975 base. The return on average net fixed assets would rise from
about zero to about 7%, increasing average net internal cash generation from
26%-of investments during Repelita II to 31% during Repelita TII.  Goverrment
assistance will be required in the form of equity investments and,lor loans
with grace periods on interest and amortization at least until FY 1979,  Cor-
sequently? theE existing Government undertaking to provide PLN the furms it
needs in. a form not requiring debt service during the recovery period has
been repeated with the pronosed Loan,



- 18 -
Subsidiary Loan
6.10      As in Loan 1127-IND, the Government agreed during netogiations to
onlend the proceeds of the proposed Loan to PLN on terms equivalent to those
of the Bank Loan. In addition, the Government will finance interest and
commitment charges during Project construction to avoic debt service payments
during the recovery period, and bear the foreignn exchange risk during the
Loan repayment period.   Signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement will be a
condition of effectiveness.
Debt Service Limitation
6.11      To avoid excessive borrowing, or borrowing on unreasonably short
terms, the debt service limitation test agreed on in Loan 1127-IND has been
repeated in the Loan documents. The covenant allows PLN to incur debt as long
as the maximum future debt service for all existing long-term debt including
thiat to be incurred, is covered by actual net revenues for the most recent
12-month period. Bank concurrence is otherwise required for the borrowing.
Tariffs
6.12      PLN's revenues are based on tariffs which became effective on
June 12, 1973. The tariff structure is essentially that proposed by SOFRELEC
in its 1972 study as updated in September 1975.  It includes low and medium
vcltage tariff classes to conform with the cost of service, and block tariffs
a; e applied with decreasing unit charges for incremental consumption.  Except
for unmetered consumers, separate demand and energy charges are being applied.
6.13      In addition PLN is permLitted to levy surcharges covering:
(i) transportaticn cost of fuel; and
(ii)  increases in the price of fuel and other current expenses.
Government approval is required for adjustment of the basic tariff, but
surcharges can be levied by PLN.
6.14      In the past PLN imposed the same level of surcharges on all con-
sumers, irrespective of tariff classes.  While this was appropriate for the
fuel c=mpcnent of the surcharge (betweeni 26% and 33%), it led to distortions
in the tar-iff structure due to the same treatment of the fixed cost component
"bet:weer- 74% and 67%). Furthermore, the surcharges mentioned in paragraph
6.13 (ii) vary between areas of the country due to political considerations.
6.15      At present, surchar-es represent approximately 25% of the basic
tariff and ideall&v ssioulld ba incorp;orated into the tariff structure.  How-
ever, this would se c-eer as a tariff increase and, considering that general
elections are due in 1977, wculd be difficult to agree by the Government.
Durilug negotzaci,s ?   in(-Anidaced that, in recognizing the deficiency in
applying the surcharges, it. already started to rectify these anomalies in the
tariff lcharges   Conseq;.iently, agreerrient nas been reached during negotiations
that PLY wil , contiaue to reto rrnge its surcharges so as to restore cost
relaedI pr:.ices.



- 19 -
6.16      PLN's level of tariffs plus surcharges (Annex 8) is high.  This
reflects the low system efficiency and the comparatively low proportion of
industrial customers. It also results from the fact that PLN bases its
surcharge calculations on overstated budget estimates without later adjust-
ment for actual costs at the end of the year.
6.17      To restrict load growth and also raise funds PLN imposes extreme-
ly high connection fees. These result in charges from about US$120 per
kVA for large customers to about US$480 per kVA for small residential cus-
tomers. For the average metered residential customer, the connection charge
is approximately equivalent to 5-year billing on the basis of present tariffs.
Once its capacity to serve the market improves these charges will have to
be reduced to more normal levels.
Audit
6.18      According to its Act, PLN must be audited by the Directorate Gene-
ral of State Financial Supervision. This is a sub-directorate of the Govern-
ment's Supreme Audit Council in charge of auditing state enterprises opera-
ted on a commercial basis. A second sub-directorate deals with Government
accounting audits (for instance ministries and Government departments).
6.19      PLN is audited on a permanent basis with the help of local
audit offices (branches of the audit council) in the provinces and some-
times sub-contracted local auditors in headquarters if sufficient audit
staff is not available. In addition to routine control, special audits
are carried out irregularly upon request of the Government.
6.20      Judging from earlier discussions with the auditor and from reports
received, audits are carried out competently. Although PLN would not object
to an additional audit by a private firm, such audit would not contribute
substantially to the understanding and efficiency of PLN's operations.
A private firm would be particularly hampered by the long distances involved
and lack of regional offices. Consequently, the standard audit covenant
has been included in the documents of the proposed Loan with the under-
standing that the Directorate General of State Financial Supervision would be
acceptable to the Bank as long as it provides satisfactory audit. Audit
reports will be sent to the Bank annually not later than 6 months after the
close of the fiscal year.
Billing and Collection
6.21      An earlier problem with PLN's huge arrears has been overcome and
an overall three-month billing level maintained during the past three years.
To ensure that billing and collection continue to be handled efficiently:
(i) the covenant requiring the Government agencies to pay
their debts to PLN promptly when due has been repeated
in the documents of the proposed Loan; and



- 20 -
(ii) PLN agreed during negotiations to continue to restrict
accounts receivable of customers other than Government agen-
cies at the end of any month to not more than the amount
billed during the previous three-month period.
6.22      In the past PLN has been generally slow in settling its accounts
payable and this has adversely affected its reputation with suppliers,
likely resulting in higher price quotations than would have otherwise
been the case. Consequently the covenant requiring PLN to settle its
debt within one month after they are due has been repeated in the docu-
ments of the proposed Loan. The one-month period should be sufficient
for settling disputes, if any.
Insurance
6.23      PLN does not presently insure its property in operation although
insurance against hazards of acquisition and transportation and delivery
of goods is regularly arranged. A recent review revealed that insurance
rates are exorbitantly high in Indonesia and would be prohibitive for PLN
as long as it is considered a high-risk company due to still low operation
and maintenance standards. As an interim measure it was agreed in earlier
operations that the Government will provide PLN with the funds required
to cover normally insurable damage minus a deductible amount equivalent to
US$100,000. This stipulation has been repeated in the Loan documents.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations of the proposed Loan, agreement was reached
on the following principal points and appropriate covenants were included
in the documents:
(a)  ministerial decree on procurement (para. 3.06);
(b)  financial recovery plan and performance targets
(para 6.03);
(c)  tariff surcharges (para 6.15);
(d)  audit (para 6.20); and
(e)  maximum level of accounts receivable (para 6.21).
7.02      The following are conditions of Loan effectiveness:
(a)  satisfactory contractual arrangements with the engineering
consultants (para 4.08); and



- 21 -
(b) signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between
the Government and PLN (para 6.10).
7.03      The proposed Project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank
Loan of US$90 million, for a term of 25 years including 5 years of grace.

FIFTH POWER PROJECT
Investment Program (,1974/75-1983/84)
1.        The investment program for electric power as described in the
following paragraphs includes only the capital requirements of PLN. Some
industries, businesses and sometimes even domestic consumers have their
own source of supply (captive plant) but no reliable information is avail-
able. A recent study by consultants estimates that 40% of PLN's demand
in Java is being provided by captive plant, a figure which is likely to
apply in other areas as well.
2.        For years power sector development in Indonesia has suffered from
financial and implementation constraints, resulting in suppressed demand and
power shortages. This situation is expected to persist for some years even
with the highest capital investment plan PLN is considered capable of imple-
menting.
3.        The investment program is based on the low forecast which is based
on a system study made by the consulting firm of Preece, Cardew and Rider.
The study arrives at an average annual demand increase of about 20% during
the coming decade, a figure which was assumed to apply also to the other
islands. The following summarizes PLN's investments during the Second and
Third Five-Year Development Plans (Repelita II and III), details of which
are shown in the attached tables.

These investments are based on 1975 prices; future price escalation has not
been provided.  The generation expansion program takes into account projects
for which foreign exchange financing was arranged by December 1975, and what
appears to be the most logical sequence thereafter. Investments for trans-
mission and distribution required to market the energy have been added; these
are larger than PLN's forecasts, which are considered inadequate.
4.        The total foreign exchange cost of all projects to be undertaken
during Repelita II and III amounts to approximately US$3,457 million, of
which US$1,888 million is for generation and US$1,569 million for trans-
mission and distribution. By end-1975, foreign financing for about 25% of
generation (US$479 million) and 32% of transmission/distribution (US$506
million) was secured. This leaves a total of almost US$2.5 billion to raise
from external sources.

FIFTH POWER PROJECT
Summary of Legislation Affecting PLN
(as of December 31, 1975)
1.        The following is a summary of the Indonesian legislation as far as
it affects directly PLN's legal status and activities. In particular it
comprises:
(i) Government Decree No. 18/1972 dated May 18, 1972 of
the President of the Republic - PLN's Charter;
(ii) Decree No. 12/PRT/1975 dated September 9, 1975 of the
Minister of Public Works and Electric Power - General
Policy, Objective and Scope of Activities. This regula-
tion revokes Decree No. 13/PRT/1972;
(iii) Decree No. 13/PRT/1975 dated September 9, 1975 of the
Minister of Public Works and Electric Power - Organization
and Business Rules of PLN. This regulation revokes
Decree No. 1/PRT/1973; and
(iv) various decrees on budget administration.
Status
2.        PLN is a Public Enterprise (Perum).  It is the executing agency
of the Ministry of Public Works and Electric Power for power development
throughout the country, carrying out its objectives within the National
Development Program in accordance with Government policies. All legal
provisions existing in Indonesia and not revoked or modified by above
decrees continue to apply.
Responsibilities
3.        Most of the activities mentioned below are PLN's exclusive res-
ponsibility. In some cases, however, the Government retained the right
of final decision, and if so, appropriate notes have been made. PLN's
responsibilities are:



ANNEX 6
Page 2
(1) construction and operation of generation, transmission
and distribution facilities including procurement. Despite
Decree No. 12/PRT/1975, which provides the Government
with the authority for procurement of goods and services
financed from the national budget, an undertaking, was
received from the Government during negotiations that it
will restrict its involvement to bid evaluation only0
(ii)  drafting of power development plans based on demand sur-Veys
and load forecasts.  These programs become part of i-e
national development plan and, conseque-ntly, are srbiect
to Government approval;
(iii)  drafting of regulations licensing power installations owned
by third parties. After approval by the Minister, adminis-
tration of the regulation becomes PLN's responsibility.
At the moment the following licensing rules apply;
(a)  no registration is required for power generators
of less than 2 kVA capacity;
(b)  generators with a capacity of 2-25 kVA must be
registered with PLN;
(c)  prior to installing a generator of more than
25 kVA capacity, a permit must be obtained from
PLN; and
(d)  installations existing before May 18, 1972 (date
of PLN's Charter) are exempt from above licensing
provisions.
(iv) entering into purchase or sales contracts of electric
power with third parties;
(v) organizing of training for its personnel; and
(vi) conducting research in the field of electric power.
In exercising its responsibilities, PLN is entitled within the framework of
existing laws and regulations to:
(i) make use of private and public roads;
(ii)  enter into and/or make temporary use of public and
private property;
(iii) install wires and cables above or under public and
private property; and
(iv)  dig in public as well as private roads.



ANNEX 6

Supervision by Government
4.        The Minister determines PLN's policy and exercises general control
over its activities. He is advised by an Advisory Board consisting of the
Ministers of Finance, Industry and National Development Planning (Chairman
of BAPPENAS) on all policy matters, including annual and long-range develop-
ment programs, tariffs, audits and other issues of major importance for PLN's
activities.
Management
5.        PLN's management is in the hands of a Board of Directors consisting
of a President Director and at least two Directors. At the moment there are
five Directors responsible for planning, construction, operation, finance
and administration. The President Director is responsible to the Minister,
the Directors report to the President Director in their respective fields.
6.        In performing its management functions the Board acts as an agent
of the Minister. The members of the Board are appointed by the President
of the Republic for a maximum period of 5 years. They are eligible for re-
ap-ointment.
7.        PLN's middle management consists of (see also Organization Chart
on page 7):
(i) Deputy Directors in headquarters;
(ii) Director Power Research Center;
(iii) Director Training Center;
(iv) Chiefs, Regional Offices; and
(v) Chiefs, Special Projects.
They are appointed by the Minister upon recommendation of the Board. The
officials mentioned in (i) through (iv) are responsible to the Board.
Concerning the Chiefs, Special Projects the decree is not clear. For all
practical purposes, however, they can also be considered as responsible
to the Board.
OKanization
8e        The organization is divided into three distinct levels which
reflect the fact that PLN has to cover a huge area with largely inadequate
communication and transportation facilities:
(i)  Leadership  -  Board of Directors together with the deputy
diractorships, all located in headquarters.
Internally the leadership level is respon-



ANNEX 6
Page 4
sible for overall guidance, planning and
policy matters in coordination with the Minis-
try. Externally it keeps contact with all
agencies of the Government, particularly the
Ministries of Public Works and Electric Power.
Operationally headquarters performs all the
tasks prior to implementation (for instance
drafting and review of bidding documents, bid-
ding documents, budget, and operation of the
central warehouse and workshop) and collection
and finalization of statistical and accounting
data.
(ii) Supporting
Services  -  Power Research Center and Training Center.
(iii) Executing
Level     -  Regional Offices and Special Projects.  The
regional offices are responsible for all
operational matters within their area as well
as the implementation of minor projects.
Special Projects are construction implementa-
tion units for projects too large or too
important to be handled by regional offices.
9.        PLN's directorates in headquarters have the following responsi-
bilities:
Directorate
Planning        -  Technical as well as management planning; input
for the national development plans; designing of
technical standards throughout the country; eval-
uation of application for captive plant licenses;
and bid evaluation and bid award.
Directorate
Operation     -  Guidance and supervision in matters of
operation and maintenance of generation,
transmission and distribution facilities;
construction of minor distribution facili-
ties; operation of the central workshop and
warehouse; and drafting of power supply con-
tracts with third parties.
Directorate
Construction  -  Guidance and supervision in project implemen-
tation; research on improvement of construction
methods; procurement of construction equipment,
if required; construction contract supervision;
and drafting and supervision of construction
budget.



ANNEX 6
Page 5
Directorate
Finance       -  Central accounting and financial management;
drafting and supervision of the revenues and
expenditures budget; and internal audit.
Directorate
Administration - Performance of administrative services; person-
nel management; legal assistance; Board secre-
tariat; and personnel safety.
Audit
10.       PLN's external audit is the responsibility of the Directorate
General of State Finance Control. PLN has to submit its annual accounts
for auditing not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year. The
audit should normally be completed within 3 months. The Directorate main-
tains staff in PLN's headquarters who are responsible for a permanent audit.
Budget
11.       The budget of revenues and expenditures is within PLN's authority
and has to be submitted to the Government only for information and as sup-
porting data on internal cash generation. The investment budget, however,
is subject to strict Government regulations and, although PLN enjoys slight-
ly more autonomy than other state enterprises, the budget process is still
cumbersome. The following paragraphs illustrate the preparation, approval
and supervision process of PLN's investment budget.



ANNEX 6
Page 6
12.                         Budget Calendar
(Fiscal Year April 1 - March 31)
September
through
December      -  After negotiations with BAPPENAS on work programs
to be performed in the coming fiscal year as well as
budget ceiling settings (this is in fact a con-
tinuous process), the final budget proposal
(Daftar Usulan Projek - DUP) is submitted through
the Minister of Public Works and Electric Power
to BAPPENAS and the Ministry of Finance to be
included in the Rencana Anggaran Pendabatan dan
Belanja Negara (RAPBN), the overall budget pro-
posal.
January       -  The President of the Republic submits the overall
budget proposal to the Parliament for approval.
March         -  Before the end of March the Parliament has to finish
its deliberations on the budget proposal which,
after approval, becomes the final budget (Anggaran
Pendapatan dan Belanja Negara - APBN).
April         -  The Ministry of Finance through the Minister of
Public Works and Power informs PLN of its share
of the final Government budget. This is called
Daftar Isian Projek (DIP).
13.       For each fiscal year regulations on budget withdrawal procedures
are stipulated by Presidential Decree. They may differ somewhat from year
to year, but in principle remain unchanged. In the case of PLN the various
regional Treasury offices receive authorization to release quarterly the
budgeted amounts over which PLN then has spending authority.

FIFTH POWER PROJECT
Project Description
1.        The Project will supply minimum electric distribution requirements
of Jakarta, its satellite cities of Bogor, Tangerang and Bekasi, and the city
of Bandung for the three-year period 1977/78 through 1979/80. The transmis-
sion lines and substations from 150/20 KV and 70/20 KV required for support
of the Project will be provided under projects either already financed or
financed from other sources.
2.        The present peak (end 1974) and the estimated peak (end 1980) on
these distribution systems are as follows:
MW Peaks
1974     1980
Jakarta                180       360
Bogor                   10        17

Bandung                 38        70
Total         234      463
3.        In brief, the proposed Project consists of the following elements
with details shown on the bill of materials:
(i) JAKARTA
Upon completion of the distribution projects financed from
Credits 165 and 334-IND, there will be 950-20 KV and
580-12 KV substations in the area. The proposed Project
will complete the low voltage changeover in the area and
add the following to the system:

Notes and Assumptions on Financial Projections
The financial projections have been made on the basis of 1975
prices. No future escalation has been assumed because the electricity
tariff contains a cost adjustment clause. This clause has been applied
in the past so as to more than compensate for the cost increases. Further-
more the attempt has been made to forecast trends in the development of
costs and revenues after FY 1978/79 (end of the recovery period). However,
these projections are tentative since agreement on PLN's financial targets
after the Recovery Period has still to be reached.
1.   Energy Sales
The electricity sales forecasts are based on the lower of two
estimates included in a system study made by the consulting firm of Preece,
Cardew and Rider for Java. Similar demand increases have been assumed to
prevail also in other areas of Indonesia.
2.   Averages Revenues per KWh Sold
Starting from the actual level of revenues prevailing during the
first half of FY 1975/76 (Rp. 21.8 per KWh), tariffs have been adjusted to
achieve a 100% revenue/cost ratio in FY 1978/79 (financial recovery) and
later to approach gradually a level of about 7% return on investment and
30% contribution to capital expenditures from internal sources.
3.   Purchased Power
The bulk of the power purchases is from the Juanda hydro station
(Jatilulur Authority) presently at Rp 1.47 per KWh. This expense increases
in step with PLN's tariff adjustments.
4.   Fuel
Present fuel prices are:
Bunker "C" Oil              : Rp 19/1
High Speed Diesel (HSD)   : Rp 22/1
Industrial Diesel (IDO)   :  Rp 19/1

in addition there are surcharges for the cost of transportation which vary
with the location of the power stations. On an average PLN charges Rp 1.52/1
for Bunker "C" oil, Rp 0.39/1 for HD, and Rp 2.45/1 for IDO. Fuel prices
are subsidized (for instance, the price for bunker "C" oil is equivalent to
US$7.28 per barrel).
5.   Personnel Expenses
An increase of 5% per year has been assumed. This represents 3%
for personnel increases and 2% for merit adjustments, promotions, upgrading
due to training and similar raises.
6.   Material
For years PLN has tried to catch up with its maintenance require-
ments.  Lack of trained personnel as well as shortage of funds so far has pre-
cluded the implementation of a proper maintenance program. It can be assumed,
however, that PLN will be able to implement accelerated maintenance schedules
by 1976/77. Consequently, increases of annually 30% per year during 1976/77-
1978/79 have been assumed, followed by 20% per year in step with the system
expansion.
7.   Depreciation
The depreciation rates are those prevailing in the past and applied
in other countries for similar type of plant. On an average these are 4.5%
for thermal and 2.5% for hydro stations, and 3.5% for transmission and dis-
tribution equipment.
8.   Corporation Tax
In principle, PLN is liable to corporation tax which, according
to the information received, amounts to about 45% of the taxable profit.
However, it has been assumed that PLN will be allowed to apply, for tax pur-
poses, a 20% "accelerated depreciation" on assets transferred to operation.
Considering the heavy investment program PLN is unlikely to pay tax during
the projected period.
9.   Capitalization
It has been assumed that the foreign component of future invest-
ments would be financed through 22-year loans (including 4 years of grace)
at an interest rate of 9% per year. During the grace period interest would
be capitalized. PLN would not have to make any debt service payments during
the recovery period. The local component of the investments, as far as not
financed through internal sources, would be covered through Government
equity contributions.
