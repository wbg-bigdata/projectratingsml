1. BACKGROUND
A. INTRODUCTION
1.1   The Government of China (GOC) has requested Bank assistance in financing the
Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project. The proposed project would reduce infrastructure
bottlenecks due to extreme water shortages, increase employment and thereby reduce
poverty, decrease human distress due to intermittent and limited water supplies, and
improve water quality in the river systems. Project objectives would be achieved by
diverting water from the Yellow River through tunnels and pipelines to industrial cities in
northern Shanxi.
1.2   Most of China's impressive economic growth since 1978 (9.5 percent per year)
has occurred in the industrial and commercial sectors, which are concentrated in urban
areas. As a result, urban area demand for water increased over 500 percent since 1978,
but available water supplies have been able to meet only 20 percent of that increase. By
1995, 400 of China's 514 largest cities suffered water shortages, with 100 of them,
located in the North China Plain (NCP) characterized as "desperately short" of water.
The economic loss due to these water shortages has been estimated at $12 billion per
year. The shortages also affect the domestic sector. Household consumption in NCP
cities averages between 20 and 50 liters per capita per day (l/c/d). The absolute
minimum for physiological and personal hygiene needs is considered to be 20 l/c/d. The
shortages have also had adverse environment impacts as local surface water has been
completely exhausted, and groundwater seriously overdrawn, leading to land subsidence
in some cities, and salt water intrusion in coastal areas. The reasons for these shortages
are straightforward. The NCP contains 40 percent of China's land and 45 percent of its
population, but only 10 percent of its water resources. The estimated annual water
deficits of 5 billion cubic meters (mi3) in the municipal and industrial sectors, and 35
billion m3 in agriculture amount to more than 70 percent of the average annual flow of the
Yellow River, the largest in North China. GOC has given top priority to alleviating these
water shortages. The longer-term "strategic" plan calls for massive water transfers from
the South, which has 80 percent of the country's water resources, to the North via the
Yellow River. The shorter-term "tactical" strategy includes medium-distance transfers
from the Yellow River to those cities most critically in need of water, including Qingdao
in Shandong Province, Beijing-Tianjin, and the industrial/mining cities of northern
Shanxi Province-the focus of this Project. These transfers will involve water previously
allocated by the State Council, and are consistent with national goals of economic and
social development, and maximum efficient use of Yellow River water.
1.3   Shanxi Province is located in northeastern China, bounded by the Yellow River to
the west and south. The current population is over 30 million, 23 percent of which is



-2-
urban and growing at an annual rate of 3.15 percent. Although agriculture is the principal
source of employment, the northern areas are highly industrialized. Northern Shanxi is
called China's "energy base" due to its vast coal deposits and electricity production,
which in 1993, was 41,700 million kilowatt-hours (kWh), or 7 percent of the national
total (25 percent of which was delivered to the North China grid). In the same year, coal
production reached 310 million tons, or 30 percent of the national total. In addition to
coal and power, Shanxi produces significant amounts of chemicals, metallurgical and
electronics goods. Overall economic growth has kept pace with the national level, with
an average real rate of 13.5 percent since 1990.
1.4   The province is relatively poor in water resources: It has the least water resources
per capita (470 mi3) in the Yellow River Basin, and is the second driest province (after
Ningxia) in terms of surface water resources. These are widely scattered among 15 river
basins, which are separated by mountains, making interbasin transfers difficult. River
flows exhibit a high degree of annual variation, although they are concentrated in the
summer. In most areas, groundwater has been tapped to its limits. Moreover, irrigated
agriculture has suffered most from water shortages: Although irrigation covers about 1 .1
million hectares (ha) or 30 percent of the cultivated area, only 50 percent have adequate
supplies, and some have received no water at all in recent years. To make matters worse,
in the northern industrial region, mining has severely affected water quality.
1.5   The most important economic impacts of the water shortage are felt in the
northern urban industrial areas in the cities of Taiyuan (the capital and largest city),
Datong (the second-largest city and mining center), and Pingshuo (a rapidly growing
mining/industrial region). In the first two, surface water supplies have virtually dried up,
and groundwater has been overextracted to a degree leading to land subsidence of over
3 meters (m) in many places. As a result, all sectors and population groups have suffered.
Farmers have sometimes resorted to irrigating with untreated industrial waste; miners are
often unable to bathe because of a lack of water; people living above the third floor have
no piped supply because pressures are too low; and industries have been forced to
extraordinary lengths and expense to conserve water. By 2000, water demands in these
three areas will outstrip supplies by a factor of 70 percent, with the gap growing much
wider afterwards.
1.6   The project would help alleviate these shortages through the construction of a
water transmission line from the Yellow River at Wanjiazhai Dam to Taiyuan, and later
to Datong and Pingshuo. Taiyuan would be served by a southern tunnel branching off a
general line into the Fen River. The other areas would be served by a northern branch,
passing through the proposed Daliang reservoir, beginning about 2005. The entire project
will deliver up to 320 million m3 per year in 2002, 900 million mi3 by 2010, and 1.2
billion mi3 by 2020. These volumes are within the allocations permitted by the Yellow
River allocation designated by the State Council, and ultimately will result in a 25 percent
increase in provincial water consumption.

B. PROJECT ORIGIN AND OBJECTIVES
1.7  In 1964, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission (YRCC) conducted a study
for the Basin and key water control projects, including the Wanjiazhai Dam Project for
diverting water to Shanxi, were identified. In 1986, the Basin plan was updated and the
conclusions of the 1964 study were reconfirmed. The study concluded that Shanxi
Province's main source of water will be from the main branch of the Yellow River. The
provincial Government started its investigation of the Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project
in 1984 and, with the help of the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR), completed the
studies and preliminary designs in 1992. The State Council approved the plan in 1993.
MWR simultaneously completed the feasibility study of the Wanjiazhai Dam and
preliminary designs in 1993, and construction for the dam was started in late 1994.
1.8  In March 1992, the Bank and YRCC carried out the Yellow River Investment
Planning Study (Report No. 11146-CHA, June 30, 1993), which sought to place
investment options in a consistent, basinwide economic framework. The study evaluated
options with respect to the development goals and physical and economic constraints.
Three interbasin transfers of water (Qingdao City transfer; Wanjiazhai transfer to
Taiyuan, Datong and Shuozhou; and the Hebei-Tianjin transfer) show a 25 percent
increase in net annual regional economic value added (Y 16.5 billion) due to more
rational usage of Yellow River water resources. The study concludes that these transfers
are some of the highest priorities for water use in the Basin.
1.9   The proposed project will therefore: (a) help meet the water needs of the northern
urban areas so as to alleviate structural bottlenecks and permit economic growth to
continue; (b) reduce the environmental impacts of land subsidence due to overextraction
of groundwater; (c) promote commercialization and corporatization of major water
resource project offices; and (d) upgrade the institutional and accounting capabilities of
the Shanxi Water Conservancy Bureau, and support the creation of the Upper Fen River
Basin Corporation for operational and water pricing functions.
C. BANK LENDING TO DEVELOP THE YELLOW RIVER BASIN
1.10  The Bank has helped finance 11 land and water resource development projects in
the Yellow River Basin. These projects focus on reducing poverty by raising agricultural
production through irrigation and drainage systems. Two of the projects involved a dam
on the Yellow River [Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Project (Loan 3727-CHA)] and the
associated resettlement [Xiaolangdi Resettlement Project (Credit 2605-CHA)]. These
projects are unique in that they were a multipurpose effort aimed at improving flood
control for about 103 million people, providing water supplies for 15 cities with water
shortages, and improving water for 2 million ha of poorly served irrigation areas. The
most recent efforts in the Basin include the Loess Plateau Project (Credit 2616-CHA),
which aims to improve watersheds to prevent further soil erosion, and the Shanxi Poverty
Alleviation Project (Credit 2834-CHA), which is designed to directly improve irrigation

areas, and provide water supply and terracing for poor areas in Western Shanxi along the
Yellow River.
D. LESSONS FROM PREVIOUS BANK PROJECTS
1.11  Although the Bank has assisted in 11 water resource and irrigation projects in the
Yellow River basin, the most important lessons for this project were drawn from the
Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Project and hydropower projects in other parts of China such as
the Shuikou Hydroelectric (Loan 2775-CHA) and Ertan Hydroelectric projects (Loan 3387-
CHA), which had large construction components. The lessons include: (a) the project
should be reviewed by a technical panel of international experts, as this improves the
design, economic assessment, and resettlement; (b) civil works procurement packaging and
joint ventures should be arranged between foreign and local contractors to obtain transfer of
technology and best international practices; (c) procurement for major civil works should
begin early so that bid awards will correspond with loan effectiveness and thus avoid delays
and cost overruns; (d) prequalification criteria should be stringent to ensure that all partners
of foreign and local joint ventures can meet their responsibilities; and (e) resettlement plans,
safety nets and budgets should be adequate. An action plan has been incorporated into the
project to ensure proper implementation of the resettlement component.
E. RATIONALE FOR BANK GROUP INVOLVEMENT
1.12  Consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for China presented to the
Board on March 18, 1997, the proposed project supports development efforts focused on:
China's poorer interior provinces; alleviating infrastructural constraints to continued
economic development; enterprise reform by commercializing operations and, inter alia,
introducing rational pricing. and fostering environmental protection for river basins. In
this regard, the project would ease infrastructural constraints in the water supply sector
that are now impeding Shanxi's economic and industrial growth, with consequent effects
on increasing employment and poverty alleviation. It would also relieve periodic
municipal water shortages; and improve the environment by reducing dependency on
groundwater resources and introducing modern water treatment facilities. By supporting
the creation of water resource corporations at various levels and commercializing those
operations by enabling them to trade water and set prices at commercial rates, the project
supports enterprise reform. And, for technology transfer, project tunnels-some of the
longest in the world -would be constructed by double-shielded boring machines, and
use of a master computer-controlled supervisory system would optimize pumping rates to
save energy costs.

2. PROJECT AREAS
A. SHANXI PROVINCE
2.1   Shanxi Province is located in northeastern China between 1 10°3O' and 114045'
east longitude and 34°30' and 40025' north latitude.  The western and southern
boundaries are the Yellow River. Neighboring provinces are Nei Mongol (north), Hebei
(east), Henan (south) and Shaanxi (west). The northeastern corner of Shanxi is
approximately 150 km from Beijing.
2.2   The geography of the province is characterized by a series of mountain chains
with elevation ranging between 1,500 and 3,000 m and alluvial plains situated between
600 and 1,100 m. Fifteen river subbasins are scattered throughout: The largest two, Fen
and Qin, cover most of the southern two-thirds of the province and are major tributaries
of the Yellow River. Mean annual precipitation is 524 millimeters (mm). The northwest
is driest (less than 400 mm) while the southwest is relatively wet (600 to 800 mm);
however, 70 percent of precipitation occurs in June through August.
2.3   Population is just over 30 million, with 23 percent classified as urban and 77
percent as rural. It has grown at 1.25 percent annually since 1990, with urban population
2~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
increasing at 3.15 percent. With a surface area of 156,270 square kilometers (km ),
population density in the province is 192 per km2, or 45 percent higher than the national
average. Of the 6,941,000 urban population in 1993, 2,588,000 (37 percent) resided in
the project areas, 1,720,000 in Taiyuan alone. Agriculture, subject to the vagaries of the
weather (given insufficient water for irrigation), has exhibited modest real growth since
1990 (Table 2.1). But the industrial sector grew by an average annual rate of 18.5
percent. This performance is remarkable in that it occurred in an environment that
experiences severe water shortages.

2.4   Within the nonagricultural sectors, coal production was the most significant,
achieving 26.9 percent of total industrial output value, followed by "other" (commerce,
services and transportation) at 23 percent, metallurgy (16.9 percent), manufacturing (15.3
percent), chemicals (11.7 percent) and electricity (6.7 percent). The last sector would
have had a much larger share had it not been for the existence of price controls, which
limits the value of its output to about 45 percent of it economic value. Clearly, Shanxi's
economy is not only highly industrialized and growing, but its industrial structure is
highly interdependent. Emerging bottlenecks, such as a water constraints that affect one
or more sectors, are beginning to have severe negative impacts throughout the provincial
economy. Since other parts of China rely heavily on Shanxi's products as critical inputs,
production problems would have a wide impact throughout the country.
2.5    Water Resources. Mean annual surface water runoff in the Shanxi Province
from  1956 through 1984 was 10.87 billion m3.  Annual exploitable groundwater
resources total 9.31 billion m3. However, 6.36 billion m3 of the groundwater and surface
water is double counted, implying that the actual average annual total water resource is
13.8 billion m . Water consumption in 1993 was 5.57 billion m3, of which 10 percent
was pumped from nonlocal sources. There are several reasons why this picture is not
nearly so optimistic as may first appear: (a) surface runoff varies greatly, and in one out
of four years, it is 6.35 billion m3 or less; (b) 7.84 billion m3 (71 percent) of surface
runoff occurs in subbasins that lay south or east of the northern demand centers and are
separated from them by long distances and/or mountain ranges; (c) runoff is concentrated
in a few summer months whereas municipal and industrial demand is year-long; and (d)
surface water flows have declined in key parts of the province in recent years. In the
Upper Fen Basin, which supplies the Taiyuan project area, surface water flows averaged
180 million m3/year before 1970, but only 47 million since 1988. This was partly due to
terracing and damming of large areas upstream of the city, and to lowered groundwater
tables (because of overpumping), which have led to greater seepage from streambeds.
Together, these factors imply that surface water resources are virtually exhausted where
and when the water is needed; the same is true of groundwater. Adjusting for double-
counted water, annual exploitable groundwater is estimated to be 2.69 billion m3. In
1992, 3.45 billion mi3 was consumed (given distribution losses, a much greater volume
was actually pumped).
2.6   Irrigation still uses more water than any other sector, with nearly 65 percent of
total consumption, but this percentage has been falling rapidly (see Table 2.2). Indeed,
the negligible growth in irrigation is evidence that water supplies have been virtually
exhausted everywhere in Shanxi as only about 80 percent of irrigable land can be treated,
and most crops receive only one-half the water recommended. If other water were
available, farmers would quickly use it to obtain the high marginal returns from
irrigation. In parts of the project area, farmers have been observed using untreated
wastewater, an unacceptable practice that the proposed project will help eliminate.

Rural                      302                    5.3           3.7

Total                  5,724                 100.0            1.5
2.7   Most surprising is that Shanxi industries have been able to maintain rapid growth
in output despite the slow growth in water supplies. In general, they have done so
through a combination of investments in water, increased recycling, and purchasing water
from local farmers, with some paying Y 1 0/m3 or more. This latter practice probably
results in water use being underreported. Such sales are illegal, and the project will seek
to promote free and efficient markets for water, since informal markets are beneficial to
3
both parties: Marginal returns from irrigation are seldom above Y 4/m , but they are
generally higher than Y 20/mr3 in industry. In 1980, Shanxi industries obtained Y 22/m3
of water; by 1990, the figure rose to 48 and exceeded 75 in 1994 (all in constant 1990
yuan). Industrial recycling of water reached 84 percent in 1993, and the province's major
industries already exceeded the 2000 China norms.
2.8   If groundwater use is kept at sustainable levels and nonlocal water resources are
excluded, Shanxi will have only about 4.2 billion m3 of reliable water supplies per year.
However, current consumption exceeds this figure by 30 percent and by 40 percent in the
project areas. Forecasts of water demand show how critical the future water balance may
become: Provincial Water Commission (PWC)-sponsored research concludes that
demand will reach 11.1 billion m3 by 2000, 13.0 by 2010, and 15.1 by 2020, despite rapid
improvements in the efficiency of water use.
B. THE PROJECT AREAS
2.9   The areas to be served by the project are those that have the highest water demand
and the most severe shortages, and the greatest potential for economic growth. While
they contain just 12.5 percent of the population, they produce 29 percent of provincial
industrial total output, over 40 percent of coal, electricity, metallurgical, and chemical
output, and contain only 7 percent of its water resources (see Table 2.3).

2.10   Taiyuan. Located in north-central Shanxi along the Fen River and near abundant
raw materials and energy sources, Taiyuan contains one of the largest concentrations of
heavy industry in China. The area to be served includes the city, its suburbs and Gujiao,
the adjacent county. Per capita water resources are only 51 percent of the provincial
average, and 9 percent of the country's. Due to water shortages, 50 percent of its mines,
factories, and enterprises periodically close, which lowers productivity: For example,
Taiyuan Chemical Industry Company, the largest chemical and fertilizer producer in the
province, has a water demand of 3,200 m 3/hour but obtains only 1,080, which results in a
60 percent shortfall in output. For all Taiyuan industries, it has been estimated that 1993
industrial output (Y 18.3 billion) would have been Y21.1 billion (+15 percent) if the
water shortage had been alleviated, and only Y 12.8 billion (-30 percent) if groundwater
use had been held to sustainable levels.
2.11   Datong. Located in northeastern Shanxi near the Sangan River, Datong is the
center of China's largest coal mining area and is an important electricity supplier to the
North China grid and Beijing. The project area includes Datong city and suburbs, and
Datong and Xinrong counties. Per capita water resources are only 230 m3, 43 percent of
the provincial average, and 8.4 percent of China's. Datong Mining Bureau operates the
largest coal mine in China, and requires 163,000 m3/day for its operations and workers'
needs. It receives only 90,500. Since part of the raw coal cannot be washed, revenue
losses per year are nearly Y 800 million. Worker sanitation is a problem as pit drainage
water is often the only available water source for bathing. Miners carry their own potable
supplies to work with them.



- 9 -
2.12  Pingshuo. The Pingshuo project area includes Shuozhou City and suburbs, and
parts of Shanyin, Zuoyun, and Youyu counties. The current situation in Shuozhou City is
not yet as critical as in Taiyuan and Datong for two reasons. First, the Shentou Spring
has been tapped for much of the area's water supplies, and large volumes of water have
been "borrowed" from local irrigators. The borrowed water is to be returned when water
from the proposed project is available. The spring has shown indications of drying up.
From a long-term average of 7.15 m3/second, discharge dropped to 4.44 in 1993-all of
which was consumed.  Planned construction of new industries, mines, and other
enterprises has been postponed pending assurance of additional water supplies.
2.13  The rationale for the Project centers around the existence and impacts of the
shortages and the ability of the project to alleviate them so that economic growth can
continue, coal and electricity can continue to be exported to Beijing and other important
areas, and the ecological degradation can be halted. Water deficits began to appear in
these areas in the late 1980s and have been intensifying. Table 2.4 summarizes water
demand, supply and deficits for 1993. "Demand" here means actual 1993 consumption
increased to account for estimates of shortages in the urban, industrial, and agricultural
sectors.  The first "deficit" column is the shortage based on actual surface and
groundwater usage and amounts to 24 percent of demand. The last column takes into
account the serious overdraft of groundwater in Taiyuan and Datong and the borrowing of
water from irrigators in Pingshuo. If groundwater usage were held to safe (sustainable)
yields, and Pingshuo farmers allowed to retain their supplies, then the true deficit in 1993
was nearly 400 million m3, or almost 40 percent of demand.

/a Consumption excludes the small use of waste and sewage.
/b Deficit with no overdraft of groundwater and no borrowing from agriculture.
2.14  The water shortages are felt by all sectors and consuming groups. Farmers around
the project areas get only about 25 percent of their needs, which explains why they
scavenge for wastewater. Urban households reportedly consume about 40 liters/day on
average (the norm for large Chinese cities is 160). But a recent survey showed that half
of surveyed people in Taiyuan get only 20 liters/day or less.

C. PROJECTED WATER SHORTAGES IN THE PROJECT AREAS
2.15   Estimated sustainable local water supplies are shown in Table 2.5 for runoff
probabilities of 50, 75, and 95 percent, and sustainable groundwater withdrawals. Both
categories of water may be overstated as they are based on long-term averages. As
mentioned above, both surface water and groundwater have been declining, particularly
around the project cities.

2.16   Because the supply of local water resources is absolutely fixed (and probably
declining), shortages can only intensify in the future as population grows, and the mining,
energy and industrial sectors continue to develop at rapid rates. Table 2.6 summarizes the
projected water demands by project area as developed by the project staff. By combining
the projected water supplies and demands, the deficits in each of the future years are
projected and shown in Table 2.7.

/a Decline in industrial output due to increasing domestic water consumption, which
deprives industry of water.
2.17  In 2000, water shortages are 41 percent of demand, 52 percent in 2010, and 61
percent in 2020. The economic impacts of the shortages will fall disproportionately on
the industrial sector since the allocation policies give priority to human consumption.
2.18  Table 2.7 illustrates the gravity of the future situation if the project is not
undertaken. The top block contains forecasts of industrial (nonagricultural) output on the
assumption of sufficient water that can only be met by the project. The second block
projects output if only sustainable supplies of local water are available assuming that
farmers' shares of available water will be kept constant at 1992 levels and all human
consumption demands are met. The bottom blocks show the forgone output if the project
is not undertaken. By 2020, 91 percent of potential output will be lost without the
project, which explains why the drastic steps of physically moving the industrial base out
of Shanxi or of moving Taiyuan to the bank of the Yellow River, have been mentioned in
Government circles as a distinct possibility.

D. OPTIONS FOR SOLVING WATER SHORTAGE PROBLEM
2.19  Consideration of a major water supply project such as this must be predicated on
an exhaustive review of alternatives such as imposing higher water prices, conservation,
increased recycling and reuse, reallocations of existing water from other areas and uses,
and even the consequences of accepting drastically lower economic growth.
2.20  Prices. Historically, water prices in Shanxi, as elsewhere in China, have been
low. Farmers have been paying Y 0.1 5/m3 or less, and industries and households, about
Y I/mi3 (see paras. 6.14-6.15). These costs are well below the marginal economic returns
and estimated willingness-to-pay. Therefore, it might be argued that the "shortage" is in
fact artificial, and that a more rational set of prices would clear the water markets and
render the Project unnecessary. Ordinarily, higher prices would have two effects: an
incentive to conserve water, and an incentive to trade water from lower-productivity uses
to higher. As noted below, conservation efforts have probably reached a technical
maximum; measures of water use efficiency have increased sharply over the past decade,
and are now leveling off. If further substantial gains were possible, then one would not
observe idle and underused factories and mines. In the household sector, about half of
Taiyuan's residents are consuming one fourth of the national average, and many, only
one eighth. It is inconceivable that higher prices would uncover significant "waste" of
water. "Grassroots" water markets have appeared in some areas. Transactions have been
observed whereby farmers sell water to industries at prices ranging from Y 5 to Y 1 0/m3.
Because these transactions are voluntary and economically motivated, they undoubtedly
favor both parties. However, agricultural water is seldom available where and when
industries need it, and the scope for expanding these markets is therefore small. In fact, if
all agricultural water in the Project area could be sold to industries and households, the
estimated water deficit in 2001 would decline by only 24 percent.
2.21   The supply of water to the Project areas is virtually inelastic. This is evidenced
by the fact that economic growth has not led to higher consumption and neither
increasing shortages nor price increases have led to decreased consumption, either within
the Project areas, or in the entire Province. Higher prices therefore would serve only to
transfer revenues from consumers to water supply entities. Heretofore, supply costs have
been low, largely associated with costs of groundwater pumping and O&M cost of the
surface water storage and distribution system (see para. 5.11). Costs of measures to
augment the supply of water have not been considered, because such sources effectively
do not exist except for the project. The project now provides an estimate of the marginal
costs of water supply, and these costs are substantially above the costs of supply existing
water and the prices currently paid. If the "new"V water is to be used efficiently, and the
Project is to be financially viable, then it is clear that prices must be increased. The
project thus provides the backdrop and the rationale for instituting a more rational pricing
system. Associated with the project will be a pricing reform policy that raises water
charges to approximately the marginal economic cost of new water, yet ensures that most
water consumers will continue to have the ability to pay for water (see para. 5.18 and
Table 5.1). The new prices will apply to all water consumed in the Project area to ensure



- 13 -
that substitution of "old" water for "new" is not encouraged. Water costs are a small
component of household and enterprise budgets, and will remain within manageable
limits even under the new price structure.
2.22  Conservation. Conservation means reducing waste and curtailing water supplies
to marginal uses. In northern Shanxi, there is virtually no waste. Water utilization ratios
are probably the highest in China. While there are water-using activities that exhibit low
returns (e.g., agriculture), these cannot be termed "marginal" given the necessity to
maintain  subsistence and incomes for millions of poor rural people.   Water
recycling/reuse, which now stands at 85 percent, has produced remarkable gains in the
productivity of water used by industries and mines. One study has shown that most
investment in Shanxi industries over the last decade has gone toward conserving water
and the marginal gains to such investment are approaching zero.
2.23  Reallocation. In 1993, irrigation accounted for 40 million m3 (21.4 percent of
total consumption) in Datong and 83 million m3 (19 percent) in Taiyuan. Irrigation
consumption as a percentage of total consumption has been declining as water has been
diverted to municipal and industrial (M&I) uses or sold by farmers who have water
rights.
2.24  However, not all of the current irrigation supplies could be diverted to M&I uses
in the project areas. Irrigation demands are seasonal, peaking in the spring, whereas M&I
demands are relatively constant throughout the year. The larger irrigated areas are not
located near the cities so that measurable reallocation would require investments in both
surface water storage and conveyance. Those irrigated areas located near the project
cities supply important and valuable produce to those cities. These products would be
difficult and costly to procure elsewhere. However, the most important justification for
not reallocating from irrigation has to do with poverty alleviation. Most of Shanxi's poor
are rural and most rural residents rely on agriculture for the bulk of their incomes.
Without irrigation, agriculture in Shanxi is a precarious undertaking due to low and
unpredictable rainfall. Irrigated yields are double those of rainfed land and could be
much higher were irrigation water available in ample supplies. Agricultural incomes are
quadrupled when crops are irrigated. In 1994, farm wages were only 33 percent of wages
in manufacturing. Thus, any further reallocation of water from farmers would have
serious negative income effects on farmers who are already the poorest population
segment.
2.25  Without the proposed project, slower economic growth is a virtual certainty and in
the project areas, a general economic decline would be highly probable. With current
water shortages in the project areas amounting to 40 percent of estimated demand, and
growing rapidly, and with both ground and surface water supplies declining, failure to
complete the project would engender economic, social, and environmental calamity.
Projections using the Provincial Planning Model (PPM) show that if the project areas'
urban residents are to be given supplies equaling the norms for China and if farmers'
water allocations are to be preserved at current levels, industrial and mining activities



- 14 -
would decline rapidly and virtually cease after the year 2010. The annual loss in
industrial output would be Y 32 billion in 2000 and Y 66 billion in 2010. The impact
would be felt throughout China, given the heavy reliance on northern Shanxi's coal,
heavy industry and chemical output. Hundreds of thousands of skilled workers would
need to be relocated and vast quantities of mineral resources would go unexploited. It is
not surprising that Chinese planners have mentioned the possibility that Taiyuan and
Datong would need to relocated (at incalculable cost) if project water is not forthcoming.
E. ALTERNATIVES TO WANJIAZHAI AS WATER SOURCE
2.26  If economic growth in the project areas is to continue and the urban population is
to receive adequate supplies of water, additional sources of water must be found.
Potential sources include (a) groundwater, (b) local surface water, (c) imported surface
water, and (d) reallocation of existing water from other uses (irrigation).
2.27  Groundwater. In Datong and Taiyuan, there is strong evidence that groundwater
is already overexploited and has been since the late 1980s. The evidence comes from
both a comparison of extraction with estimates of sustainable yields and from
observations of declining water tables and increasing incidence of land subsidence. In
1993, groundwater overdraft in Datong was 40 percent higher than sustainable yield, and
in Taiyuan, 15 percent. Groundwater supplied 86.7 percent of total consumption in
Datong in that year, and 80.4 percent in Taiyuan. Except in the Shuozhou city center
area, groundwater extraction in the Pingshuo project area has not reached crisis levels.
This area has relied heavily on Shentou Spring, the average discharge rate of which had
dropped nearly 40 percent by 1993. The question is not whether increased extraction of
groundwater can be tolerated but whether current levels can be sustained to the year 2000
when the project water is scheduled to become available.
2.28  Local Surface Water. Taiyuan City is situated near the upper end of the Upper
Fen Basin, an enclosed hydrological entity that relies almost entirely on snowmelt and far
upper reach runoff for the river flow. There is negligible offtake above Taiyuan City and
its northern suburbs, but virtually unlimited demand for water in and around Taiyuan and
downstream for irrigation. The utilization rate has been as high as 74 percent in recent
years, which is probably the highest in the Yellow River Basin. This level cannot be
increased, given the seasonality of flows and high sediment content during flood periods.
This level of utilization has resulted in the riverbed often running dry much of the year,
and a dramatic decline in the irrigation supplies to downstream farmers. Furthermore,
there is strong evidence that recorded Fen river flows have been declining at statistically
significant rates. This has been caused by extensive terracing (to conserve water and
lessen erosion) upstream, and by the decline in groundwater tables, which increases
losses from seepage. Datong is located near the middle of the Sanganhe Basin, and
utilizes surface water from the Sanganhe River as well as small volumes from the Yuhe
River which originates in Nei Mongol Province. Sanganhe resources available to Datong
3
are again small relative to projected demands (36 million m at P75 vs. 352 million m
projected 2000 demand), and also are seen to be declining for the same reasons applying



- 15 -
to the Upper Fen. In recent years, the Yuhe supplied about 74 percent of Datong's total
surface water, and the flow of this river is declining sharply as Nei Mongol develops uses
for the water for its own internal economic expansion. Downstream of Datong lies the
Cetian Reservoir which, by agreement, permits 31 million m3/year to be pumped back to
Datong. The remainder of Cetian's storage goes for consumption in Hebei and Beijing
City, which are also experiencing chronic water shortages.
2.29  Imported Surface Water. The alternative sources for importing surface water
are either from adjacent subbasins within Shanxi or from the Yellow River. Shanxi is
divided into 15 subbasins or catchment areas. Conceivably, Taiyuan could receive water
diverted from the Northwest or Hotuohe basins, and Pingshuo and Datong could receive
water from the Honghe and Yanghe basins, respectively. Two factors make these options
virtually impossible. First, water shortages are prevalent throughout northern Shanxi and
are intensifying everywhere. Only in the west are excess surface flows projected, and
these occur mostly in flood season, draining directly into the Yellow River, at points
remote from the project area water demand centers. Second, the division of Shanxi into
subbasins follows the pattern of intervening mountain ranges, which would need to be
crossed if water were to be diverted. These ranges are as high as 3,000 m and would
involve daunting technical and economic challenges.
2.30 The above discussion implies that only importation of water from the Yellow
River by a project such as the proposed Wanjiazhai can meet the projected water
demands. Alternatives cannot supply the volumes required, or would pose even greater
difficulties and higher costs than the proposed project. However, is Wanjiazhai the best
location on the Yellow River for the diversions? It is probably the only location that is
feasible. Above Wanjiazhai the Yellow River turns westward, requiring longer and more
costly diversion routes, and one that encroaches on Nei Mongol. Below Wanjiazhai, the
Loess Plateau begins with its associated runoff with high silt concentrations, which would
require prohibitively high treatment costs.
F. PROJECT PHASING
2.31   The economic and social effect of the water shortage situation is sufficiently
severe in each of the described project areas to warrant the immediate attention to
remedies such as the project. However, a project of the scope and cost of the full project
(para. 1.6) is not feasible given the limited financial means of the Province, and the
capacities of local contractors. Thus, the Project needs to be phased, beginning with the
General Transmission Line and either the North Line (to Datong and Pingshuo) or the
South (to Taiyuan and its environs). The second alternative has been selected for two
reasons. First, Taiyuan has a much larger urban population that would benefit from the
increased household water supplies, and a slightly greater industrial capacity suffering
from shortages than do the northern areas. Second, there is a much larger irrigation area
around and downstream from Taiyuan that could make immediate use of treated
wastewater to increase farm output and agricultural incomes. Thus Phase I of the project
will first serve Taiyuan beginning about 2001, followed by the northern areas in Phase II.

3. THE PROJECT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
3.1   The project is part of a phased development program to expand the water supply
and improve the land and water environment in northern Shanxi province. Specific
objectives include:
(a)   Reducing the severe infrastructural bottlenecks in water supply that
impede economic growth;
(b)   Increasing employment and incomes by eliminating the paramount
constraint to development;
(c)   Reducing the distress of the urban population caused by insufficient and
intermittent water supplies, which are barely enough to meet their basic
needs;
(d)   Improving the environment by ending the overextraction of groundwater
and the subsequent drying of surface streams and land subsidence, and by
treating all waste, so as to reduce water pollution downstream;
(e)   Creating a system to rationalize water use, by sector, and reducing water
shortages by managing demand; and
(f)   Promoting integrated management and financial independence for water
institutions.
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
3.2   The project would provide the physical works needed to transfer water from the
Yellow River through a system of tunnels, aqueduct pipelines and reservoirs. It would
also support policy and institutional reform for economic water pricing and water
marketing. The project would include the following components:
(a)   Yellow River Diversion Project Corporation (YRDPC)
(i)    Work on the general main tunnel (GMT) would be completed. This
would involve civil works for tunnels no. 1 to 3, 6 to 11, and all
connecting structures such as aqueducts and siphons, power
transmission lines (220 kV, 110 kV, 35 kV) and transformer stations
as well as preparatory work for access roads, adits and water supply
for the south main tunnels (SMT);



- 17 -
(ii)    Civil works for five pumping stations (two underground and three
above ground) and for pressure tunnels no. 4 and 5 for the GMT;
(iii)    Construction of all seven tunnels (totaling 98 km), four aqueducts
and the bifurcation structure for the SMT;
(iv)    Supply and installation of equipment for all pumping stations on the
GMT and SMT. The supply would include all pumps (6.0-6.45
m3/second units), motors (10 MW to 12 MW units), controls for the
motors, communications, valves, gates and steel works;
(v)    Construction of connecting works from the end of the SMT to
Taiyuan that will include a headworks at Fen-1, a 41 km twin
pipeline (2.2-2.4 m diameter each) and a 17.1 km tunnel to the
Huyang treatment plant outside of Taiyuan;
(vi)    Resettlement/compensation  for all people displaced  by  the
aqueducts;
(vii)   Environmental management techniques to offset the negative effects
at the construction sites or from any part of the project;
(viii)    Consultant services to supervise construction, create a board to
review disputes, establish a panel of experts for the design and
construction of underground works and training programs, and
organize an environment/resettlement panel.
(b)   Water Resources Institutional Reform
(i)    Reform of all major water resource institutions will be undertaken
within the Yellow River water delivery area: YRDPC, Fen-1, Fen-2,
Fenhe Irrigation Bureau, Taiyuan Water Company and Taiyuan
Sewerage Bureau. The YRDPC, Fen-1, Fen-2, Fenhe Irrigation
Bureau and the Taiyuan Groundwater Institution and Rural
Groundwater Institution will be integrated into a Upper Fen River
Basin Corporation (UFRBC). This corporation will be responsible
to license all water sold (surface or groundwater) to all users in the
Upper Fen Basin. UFRBC will issue permits for the sale of water
and discharge of water and waste water. To ensure financial
autonomy, water pricing would be liberalized to obtain the best
arrangements within the various sectors, and trading between
sectors. The Taiyuan City, the Fen Bureau Irrigators, Gujao City,
and industries will form the users of water and UFRBC will issue
permits for use for different sources of water. Prices will be based
on the quality of water, time when water is needed, the return flows
and the quality of return flows. The users of the water, Taiyuan City



- 18-
Water Company, Sewerage Company, and Irrigators will also be
reformed so that they will also be financially autonomous.
(c)   Water Pollution Control and Industrial Waste Management
(i)    An environmental master plan for Taiyuan, which would involve
studies on a wastewater permit system, pollution enforcement, and a
phased pollution prevention program;
(ii)    An in-plant wastewater monitoring system and effective pollution
permit system, with charges high enough to deter industries from
discharging waste above the standards;
(iii)    Training and upgrading Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB)
staff skills to prevent pollution, establish and operate pollution
permit systems and a data base for monitoring water and wastewater
quality;
(iv)    A fund to introduce cleaner technology in the seven main polluting
industries (steel, coal, coke, pharmaceuticals, paper, fertilizer and
chemicals).
3.3   Complementary works for Taiyuan would be needed for receiving, treating and
distributing water; they will be carried out by the Taiyuan Municipal Water Company
(TMWC). These works are not under the project but will be implemented in parallel by
TMWC. Also, the city will need to make added investments to ensure that wastewater
generated from the increased water supply will be intercepted, collected and treated. This
will prevent water quality in the Fen River from deteriorating as it passes through the area.
The works that will be financed by a combination of local and Japanese Government
sources (para. 3.41) will involve the following components:
(a)   Water supply for Taiyuan
(i)    A new surface water treatment plant at Huyang with an initial
capacity of 0.9 million m3 per day in 2003, to be increased to 1.4
million m3 per day by 2005 and to 1.76 million m3 per day by 2010;
(ii)    A new network of water transmission lines of 170 km for the City,
with pipe diameters of 300 to 2,000 mm and a special water line of
13 km for the power station;
(iii)    Two booster stations;
(iv)    Consultant services for detailed design and engineering;
(v)    Training for water company staff in finance, operations and
maintenance management.



- 19 -
(b)   Wastewater Collection and Treatment
(i)   Eight new wastewater treatment plants for eight new areas (Hexi,
Xiaodian, Xishan, and Shanglan, Luocheng, Nanxiawen, Jinei and
Power Plant No. 1);
(ii)    Rehabilitating five existing wastewater treatment plants (Yang Jiabu,
Ying Jiabu, Beijiao, Zhaozhuang, and Nanyan);
(iii)   Laying the first phase of 170 km of interceptors and secondary and
tertiary sewers by 2002 (ultimately 660 km);
(iv)    Consultant services for master plan and feasibility studies and first-
phase design;
(v)    Training for municipal commission staff and for institutional
development (to integrate wastewater collection and treatment).
C. PROJECT MONITORING
3.4   Project impact would be monitored with respect to the project objectives (POs),
the key indicators of which are listed below:
(a)   For PO(a), it is planned to monitor the economic output of different
sectors of industry and water deliveries;
(b)   For PO(b), employment growth and income will be monitored;
(c)   For PO(c), it is planned to monitor the water deliveries to households;
(d)   For PO(d), it is planned to monitor the water supplied from groundwater to
all sectors, to observe whether these exceed the safe yield levels of
extraction and to monitor the water quality in the Fen River and tributaries
around and below the city limits;
(e)   For PO(e), it is planned to monitor the industrial and urban water
deliveries to each sector and their economic outputs and employment; and
(f)   For PO(f), it is planned to monitor the progress of pricing reform and the
corporatization of water suppliers in the Upper Fen River Basin and their
integration into the Upper Fen River Basin Corporation.
D. PROJECT FORMULATION
3.5   The Wanjiazhai Dam, identified in the Yellow River Master Plan as the most
economic site, would be the main diversion point from the Yellow River. The dam is not
under the project, but is being constructed by MWR. It is located below the bend



- 20 -
southward (after Hekouzen) where the catchment area is 394,813 km2 (52 percent of the
river basin) and river flows average about 19.7 billion m 3/year. The lowest flow recorded
at this point was 11 billion m3/year in 1928. Since the diversion requires only 1.2 billion
m3/year, there will always be sufficient water for this purpose.
3.6   The dam, of the concrete gravity type, is designed to preserve the long-term
storage of 445 million m3 of water, which will be drawn through two side sluices to the
pumping stations at an elevation of 948 m. The reservoir's normal operating level will be
977 m; its lowest level, 952 m, occurs during silt flushing. The intake sluice sills for the
tunnels skim the water from the reservoir's upper section so that suspended sediment is
minimized and concentration levels are kept to relatively low levels of 1 to 1.3 kg/m3. In
winter, intake sills would be heated to prevent ice from closing the intake. Pumping from
the reservoir would occur only from October to July, because suspended silt
concentrations can exceed 5 kg/m3 in August and September. Safety aspects of the design
were reviewed by consultants appointed by MWR and additional specialists were
appointed to review these aspects during design and construction. MWR has also
installed exterior and interior equipment on the dam to monitor any movements or
deflections in the dam. At negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom the Borrower that
it will prepare, by December 31, 1998, a satisfactory maintenance program and an
emergency preparedness plan for the dam. Also, the Borrower will employ independent
experts with qualifications, experience and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank to
inspect the dam, associated works and structures regularly starting October 31, 1998,
according to sound engineering practices, to determine if any of the structural conditions,
maintenance or operating methods could endanger safety (see Annex 17). Inspections
would be conducted annually for the first five years of operations and every three years
thereafter.
3.7    MWR, through the Tianjin Design Institute, developed a detailed environmental
impact assessment (EIA) for the dam and program for resettlement. The EIA covered
subjects such as water temperature and quality, reservoir sedimentation, ice regimes and
floods, reservoir regulation, environmental geology, fisheries, impacts of construction
sites, protection measures around resettlement areas and the environmental monitoring
system.   It indicated that dam  construction should not cause any  significant
environmental degradation, provided the dam is operated as planned, which would
include incorporating the Environmental Management Plans specified in the EIA, and
provisions for resettlement. Also, it concluded that resettlement is the project's only
major negative impact, which will be completely offset by the ongoing resettlement plan.
Altogether, 664 residents are affected at the dam site and 6,047 in the reservoir area. All
664 at the dam site have been resettled, the new areas developed and industries opened to
ensure that the income of those resettled is maintained. In fact, surveys indicate that most
incomes have increased by 35 percent. As for the 6,047 residents in the reservoir area,
the investment planned totals Y 510 million, or about Y 84,000/person, which far exceeds
any previous resettlement expenditures in China. Nevertheless, during negotiations,
assurances were obtained that the Borrower will (a) complete the resettlement for the
Wanjiazhai Dam according to a resettlement action plan that has been found acceptable to



- 21 -
the Bank, (b) employ by February 15, 1998 an independent monitoring institution with
qualifications, experience and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank to evaluate
semiannually the socioeconomic progress of those resettled from the dam site; and
(c) provide the Bank with a report of each evaluation along with proposals for meeting the
resettlement plan targets, if they have not been achieved. It is planned that the monitoring
institution will be the Yellow River Conservancy Commission Resettlement Office.
3.8   MWR is in charge of project implementation. Dam construction began in March
1994 and the river was closed in November 1995. The first turbine should be installed in
November 1998 and the dam completed sufficiently to start diverting water from the
Yellow River.
3.9   Alignment and Routing. The issues of tunnel alignment and routing the water
were studied for three decades. The tunnel and water route are shown in Map IBRD
28136, and a schematic is shown in Figure 1, Annex 1. The route was selected based on
the geology that provides the strongest rock relatively free of groundwater, the shortest
distance for the transfer, the lowest cost and pumping requirements. Based on these
criteria, the best alignment for the general main tunnel (GMT) moves eastward from the
Wanjiazhai Dam from an elevation of 957 m, through a mountain range at 1,582 m, and
follows the Pinguan River, which flows west, for about 44 km to Xiatuzhai Village,
where the bifurcation structure is located for the north main tunnel (NMT) and south
main tunnel (SMT). The alignment for the SMT starts from Xiatuzhai and passes through
the Guancen Mountain (2,800 m high) to the Luya Shan Range, for 102 km into the Fen
River Basin. This is the shortest route to the Fen River. From the connection tunnel to
the Fen, the water travels via the upper Fen for 66 km and enters an existing reservoir,
Fen-1. Here the water is transported by way of twin pipelines for 40.2 km and tunnels for
16.8 km. The route was selected because it offered the lowest-cost construction, least
possibility of pollution, lowest loss of water and minimal environmental impact.
3.10  Five pumping stations would move water through these tunnels: three are on the
GMT and two on the SMT. Four have pump lifts of 142 m and one is 80 m. These lifts
were designed to reduce tangential velocities in the impellers so that sand erosion will be
reduced. The station locations were also chosen to maximize pumping efficiency.
3.11  The GMT is in competent mass limestone and dolomite (rock class 1-3) most of
the way (81 percent); only small sections, in the tunnel openings, are in shale, sandstone
and soils. The SMT is also mainly (88 percent) in competent dolomites and limestone
(rock class 1-3) and some small sections are in soils, red clays, sandstone and coal. Most
of the tunnel construction will be by tunnel boring machine (TBM) with double shields.
The tunnel lining will be placed automatically by the TBM. The lining will be precast
reinforced concrete segments made on-site in a segment production factory. Use of
TBMs for construction for long tunnels has been found to be very economical and give
good construction quality. Construction in the less-competent rock would be undertaken
manually, with drill and blast (D/B) techniques. The alignment of both tunnels was



- 22 -
optimized to ensure that geological conditions will be good and construction can be fully
mechanized, thus achieving high quality at low cost.
3.12  Reservoirs. The water transfer system has two main regulating reservoirs. The
Shentongshui Reservoir, with a capacity 150,000 m3, is located between the GMT's
tunnels 5 and 6. It will regulate the inflow of water from the Wanjiazhai Reservoir and
also regulate water flowing out to the rest of the tunnels in the GMT. The reservoir will
be the main dynamic regulator in the entire GMT and SMT tunnel system. Additional
dynamic regulation will be achieved through variable speed motors in the pumping
stations. The only other reservoir will be the Fen-1, located in the Fen Basin about 57 km
from Taiyuan. The Fen Dam was built in the 1960s with a capacity of 700 million m3
3                                      3
and an active storage of 385 million m . The reservoir will provide 120 million m
storage for the period when pumping is not possible from the Wanjiazhai Reservoir
(because of suspended silt loads of over 5 kg/m3). (See Annex 1, Figure 1.1.)
3.13  At negotiations, assurances were obtained from Shanxi Province that it will
continue its program of dam maintenance for Fen-] dam; also that the Province and
independent experts with qualifications, experience and terms of reference acceptable to the
Bank would, not later than February 15, 1998, inspect the dam-associated works and
structures, according to sound engineering practices. This would be done to determine if
any of the structures, maintenance or operating methods are deficient and may compromise
their safety. Shanxi will biannually submit the experts' reports to the Bank starting with
the first report by November 15, 1998.
E. PROJECT WORKS
3.14 General Main Tunnel. The GMT has 11 tunnels, five aqueducts, three pumping
stations (GM1, GM2 and GM3), and one underground regulating reservoir. The tunnels
and aqueducts are designed for a flow capacity of 48 m3/second and to pump 1,200
million m3/year of water to Datong, Pingshuo and Taiyuan. The first phase of the project
will have a capacity to pump 640 million m3/year (25.8 m3/second) to Taiyuan; and,
although the tunnels and aqueducts will be completed at this capacity, the pump stations
will initially have a reduced number of units (because of lower demand in 2002) to pump
320 million m3/year (12.5 m3/second), reaching 640 million m3/year by 2010.
3.15  Tunnels 1 to 5 are pressurized while all others are free-flowing. Tunnels 1 to 8
are circular, with cross-sections of 5.6 m for tunnels 3 to 5, and 5.46 m for tunnels 6 to 8.
Tunnels 9 to 11 have a city-gate shape, 5.0 m wide and 5.36 m high. The 11 tunnels vary
in length: tunnels 8 and 11 are 10 to 12 km, tunnels 6 and 9 are 6 to 7.5 km, and tunnels
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 vary from 0.21 km to 2.67 km. The five aqueducts connect the tunnels.
3.16  The Shentongshui Reservoir is located after the two pump stations, between
tunnels 5 and 6. Situated at the end of tunnel 5 and at the start of tunnel 6, it is an
underground cavern 12 m wide by 6 m high and 2,900 m long and has storage of
151,000 m3 and control gates to regulate the flows.



- 23 -
3.17  There are two underground pumping stations to pump water from the Wanjiazhai
Reservoir. Pump station 1 is located between tunnels 3 and 4 and pump station 2 is
located between tunnels 4 and 5. Each of the pump stations will be designed to have an
ultimate pumping capacity of 10 units of 6.45 m3/second for each unit. The static lift for
each unit will be 142 m head. Each chamber will be excavated some 130 m long, 18 m
wide and 35 m high. A third pumping station is located between tunnels 10 and 11 and
will be above ground. This pump station will also have 10 pumps of 6.45 m3/second.
3.18  Preparatory work for GMT consists of construction of access roads (105 km),
power supply (220 kV and 110 kV lines), a communications system, and access adits for
all tunnels. Most of this work has been completed. In addition, to get an early start,
YRDPC awarded tunnels 6, 7, and 8 to an international contractor in 1994. Similarly,
contracts for tunnels 1, 2, 9, 10, and 11 were already awarded to national contractors that
were selected through national competitive procedures. Bank missions have reviewed
these works, which are being funded by YRDPC, and the quality of design and
construction is satisfactory. Bank funding for the GMT will focus on tunnels 3, 4, and 5
and the pumping stations.
3.19 South Main Line. The SMT consists of seven free-flow tunnels (98 kin), two
buried pipes, two aqueducts, three culverts and two pumping stations. The discharge
capacity of these facilities is 25.8 m3/second. Tunnels 1 to 3 will have a horseshoe-
shaped cross-section, with a top diameter of 4.24 m, an invert width also of 4.24 m, and
water depth will be 3.08 m. As tunnels 4 to 7 will be constructed with boring machines
(TBM), the tunnels' shape will be circular with a diameter of 4.2 m. Tunnel lengths, as
indicated in Table 3.1, particularly for tunnels 5 (26.4 km) and 7 (42.6 km), are among
the longest in the world.
TABLE3.1: TUNNELLENGTHS

3.20  The SMT will have two pumping stations at ground level, 81.3 m long, 15.4 m
wide and 27.7 m high. Pumping station 1 is located between tunnels 1 and 2 and
pumping station 2 is located between tunnels 2 and 3. Each will have six units of pumps
with a unit capacity of 6.45 m3/second and lift capacity of 142 m.
3.21  Connecting Works. The connecting works link Taiyuan's main water treatment
plant to the Fen-1 reservoir, a distance of about 57 km. The works consist of an intake
tower in the reservoir and a pipeline that follows the Fen riverbed most of the way to the
city. The dam was constructed in 1961 for flood control, irrigation and water supply; it



- 24 -
has been upgraded several times with new outlet tunnels to sluice silt through and
stabilize the active storage. Dam safety inspections have also been carried out by the
Shanxi Water Conservancy Bureau.
3.22  The pipelines are six twin lengths, for a total of 40.2 km, and seven tunnel
sections of 16.7 km. The pipe-lengths vary from 10.8 km to 0.11 km and the diameters
are 2.2 m to 2.5 m. The seven tunnels vary from 0.1 km to 13.122 km and the diameters
vary from 2.2 m to 2.5 m. Prefabricated reinforced concrete pipes will be used, as they
can withstand a pressure of 10 bars at the joints. The pipeline will have 7 valve
chambers, 76 inspection wells, 134 ventilation air valves, 6 pressure reduction valves, 2
energy dissipation pools, 17 regulator valves and 2 butterfly valves. The tunnels will be
constructed using drill and blast techniques. (See Annex 1, Figures 1.2 and 1.3.)
3.23  Plant and Equipment. The main equipment to be procured will be pumps,
motors, controls and communications items. The required flow between 2001 to 2010 is
12.9 m3/second and after 2010, it will be 25.9 m3/second. For the first stage (in 2001),
there will be 15 units of vertical centrifugal pumps (three pumps per station). Each
pump's unit capacity will be 6.45 m3/second, with a static lift capacity of 142 m. Pump
power of 10.8 MW will be used for the first two pumping stations on the GMT and two
stations on the SMT (a total of 12 units). For the third pumping station, unit capacity will
be 6.45 m3/second, but the static lift capacity will be 80 m and the pump power will be
6.3 MW. The pump inlet, guide vanes and outlet areas will be coated with special
hardened materials and impellers will be made of hardened steel to resist sand erosion.
Fifteen synchronous vertical shaft electric motors will be procured: three units with a
capacity of 6.75 MW and 12 units with a rated capacity of 12.5 MW. Except for the
GMT's, the first two stations, which will use fixed-speed motors (six units), all other
motors will be variable-speed drives (nine units). The starting facilities for the fixed-
speed motor units will be variable-frequency starters (6 units) and for the variable-speed
motors will be variable-speed converters (9 units).
3.24  Control Systems. One central dispatching and control station and 13 local
control stations will be built to coordinate and integrate the operations of the entire
diversion system and to enhance reliability and safety. Control and automation systems
will be procured for flow control, economic flow dispatching, normal starting and
stopping, automatic operation and coordination for emergency events, and operation
monitoring. Of the three levels of controls, the first level is at the local pump unit and the
control consists of starting and stopping a pump unit, automatic actions in the event of an
emergency and data collection for levels two and three. The second level is at the pump
station for managing pump units, gate and valve control. At this level, data will be
collected to be transmitted to level three and information will be displayed at local
centers; there will also be some remote control functions. A third level will have a
supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA). It will manage by remote
control the whole hydraulic network and equipment, and emergency shutdown of pumps.
There will also be global monitoring of all equipment and storage of all historical



- 25 -
information. In addition, there will be programs to control operations of all pumps and
motors to maximize the system's efficiency.
3.25  Water Sector Institutional Reform.  This component affects several water
resource institutions in the area where water from the Yellow River will be transferred
under one corporation, the Upper Fen River Basin Corporation (UFRBC) for the supply
of water. The users of water will be the cities, industries, irrigators, etc. The users will
be issued permits to use water by UFRBC.
3.26 These institutions include YRDPC, the Fen River Dam I Bureau, Fen River Dam
II Bureau, and Fen River Irrigation Bureau. UFRBC will be responsible for all water
permits (surface or groundwater). Also, water user charges are so low that the institutions
receive subsidies, and are not financially autonomous.
3.27  The reform will have two phases. In the first (from 1997 to 2000) all suppliers of
water, YRDPC, Fen-1, Fen-2, Groundwater Institutions, Fen Irrigation Bureau, will be
corporatized and made financially independent from the Government. The irrigation
districts at the village level will be turned over to farmers who will run the systems
themselves. The water resources management institutions at the town, county and district
levels will be corporatized, converted to financially autonomous units, and would derive
all their revenues from user charges. In addition, water prices (see para. 5.18 and Table
5.1) will be at levels to reflect the economic value of water. Also, the allocation of water
resources will ensure that industrial and urban sectors are provided with enough water,
although there will be a basic allocation of water for agriculture and human consumption.
Last, water trading within and outside of sectors will be allowed to achieve more rational
use.
3.28  In the second phase, all six water agencies will be placed under one corporation or
holding company to better manage the resource. A more detailed description is given in
Annex 1 1.
3.29  The regulatory body, the Wanjiazhai Water Management Committee, will
coordinate management activities of the corporatized entities mentioned above. This
body will regulate water allocation and future price adjustments and thus ensure
consistency of water prices across sectors and sources, monitor surface and groundwater,
and coordinate and approve water trading.
3.30  The reform will be carried out by three institutions: the Shanxi Commission for
Structural Reform (SCSR), the Water Conservancy Department (SWCD) and Bureau for
Price Administration (SBPA).
3.31  Technical assistance of $10.1 million (including contingencies) will be provided
under the project to help carry out the work and will be applied as follows: $2.5 million
for consultants including $200,000 for promoting community participation, $0.7 million
for training, $2.6 million to establish a water resources monitoring system, and $4.3
million for equipment and vehicles (see Annex 2, page 99).



- 26 -
3.32  Water Pollution Control and Industrial Waste Management. The project also
provides for investments in water pollution control and industrial waste management.
The Taiyuan and Shanxi Province EPBs will be strengthened, conduct studies and
implement programs to improve pollution control and maintain water quality in the Fen
River and other receiving waters at acceptable levels. These initiatives will include:
(a)   An environmental master plan for Taiyuan, which involves a wastewater
management master plan to further develop the discharge pernit system
and related pollution prevention programs;
(b)   In-plant wastewater monitoring and enforcement systems, with effective
charges and penalties;
(c)   Training for EPB staff; and
(d)   A subloan facility of $8.0 million to implement cleaner technologies in the
main polluting industries.
3.33  The purpose of the subloan facility is for financing industrial enterprises in
Taiyuan City to adopt Clean Technologies to reduce and control their pollution to protect
and improve the Fen River water quality and the environment of Taiyuan. The local
counterpart fund will come mainly from the special environment protection investment
from Shanxi Provincial and Taiyuan City Govermments as well as from enterprises' self-
raised fund. To effectively manage the subloan facility, Taiyuan will establish a special
body, the Subloan Administration Technical Committee (SATC), and an executive
agency, the Subloan Management Office (SMO), which are patterned after the experience
of Tianjin, which also has a major industrial center with problems of waste management
similar to these at Taiyuan. SATC is in charge of subloan management, which comprises
representatives of concerned government agencies including TEPB, Taiyuan Planning
Commission, and Taiyuan Finance Bureau with TEPB at leading position. The major
duties for SATC include: (a) preparing directives and regulations for subloan use;
(b) setting up subloan approval conditions; (c) setting up the SMO; (d) approving the
SMO annual work plan; (e) approving subloan projects; and (f) reviewing the SMO
annual report.
3.34  Subloan Operation Procedure. Initial proposals are to be made by candidate
enterprises and submitted to responsible government agencies for review and permission.
Then, formal proposals are submitted to the SMO for appraisal with the criteria discussed
below.
3.35  Procedures for Processing Subloans. TEPB with the use of local consultants
will be responsible for processing the subloans. The enterprises will prepare an initial
feasibility that will be reviewed in detail by TEPB using its own consultants. TEPB will
appraise the proposals and submit the appraisal to the SMO for final approval. Prior
Bank review will only be needed for the first three subprojects and subsequent
subprojects for which subloans of over $1.0 million or more are proposed.



- 27 -
3.36  Subborrower Eligibility Criteria. The subborrower must be in the following
types of industries: steel, chemicals including fertilizer, paper mills or pharmaceuticals.
Under the circumstances, a loan will be made available under a first come/first serve basis
to industry who could meet the following criteria and subproject eligibility criteria: (a) is
a limited liability (shareholding) company or otherwise established as a legal entity;
(b) has a completed EIA approved by the TEPB and has a mitigation plan satisfactory to
the Bank; (c) has adopted the new accounting standards and its financial statements have
been audited by independent auditors; and (d) the company has been appraised and found
creditworthy (see Annex 15).
3.37  Terms of the Subloan. The subloan terms will be as follows:
* Interest Rate and Fees. Subborrowers will pay a commitment fee of 0.75 percent
on the undisbursed amount of the subloan. The minimum interest margin will be
2 percent over the Bank interest rate but could vary depending on the cost of
undertaking the required appraisal and loan processing, administrative overheads
for the SMO and repayment risk.
*  Maturity. The maturity of individual subloans will be no more than three years'
grace and eight years' repayment period.
*  Rate of Return. Each subproject financed will have a financial rate and an
economic rate of return of no less than  1I percent.
3.38  The maximum size of a loan cannot exceed $1.5 million. The proceeds of the
subloan are mainly for pollution control equipment and services and must not cover the
costs of civil works, taxes, or land.
3.39  During negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom Shanxi that it will establish
through Taiyuan an SMO with terms of reference, staffing and other resources
acceptable to the Bank by December 31, 1997 to appraise subprojects, provide subloans
and supervise, monitor, and report on subprojects in accordance with an operations
manual's procedures and on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. Appraisal
procedures will focus on (a) an analysis of the viability of the enterprise undertaking the
project; (b) an evaluation of the subproject's EIA's mitigation plan; (c) an evaluation of
procurement arrangements; and (d) an assessment of the enterprise's ability to pay back
the loan.
F. COMPLEMENTARY WORKS
3.40  Complementary investments and activities described in detail in para. 3.3 will be
needed to efficiently and economically use some 640 million m 3/year of additional raw
water from the Yellow River to the Fen River (for the use of Taiyuan and surrounding
areas). These complementary works will be planned, financed and implemented by
Taiyuan and the Province over the next 25 years. The investments will double Taiyuan's
available water resources by 2001, triple them by 2020, and support sustained economic



- 28 -
growth and higher living standards over the whole region.  The relevant sector
institutions responsible for implementing them and, operating and maintaining services
are being reformed and expanded to accomplish the tasks.
3.41  Costs and Financing of Complementary Works. The estimated cost of the
water supply component is about Y 3.2 billion and of the wastewater component, Y 3.0
billion. These works will be financed from self-generated funds, including increased
water and wastewater charges, other provincial sources (Y 0.9 billion), and from bilateral
loans. Bilateral and multilateral sources have tentatively earmarked a loan to cover up to
70 percent (Y 1.8 billion) of the cost of the water supply component. It is also expected
to finance about Y 750 million of the wastewater component.  Taiyuan industrial
enterprises are expected to contribute about Y 765 million.
3.42  Implementation Schedule. Most of these works are scheduled to be completed
concurrently with the additional project water coming onstream. The Huyan Treatment
Plant, with a capacity of 1.0 million m3/day, and the replacement of about 170 km of
undersized and aging transmission lines and the installation of new lines will be
completed by 2002.  Rehabilitation of the five sewage treatment works and the
completion of the first phase of the sewer program (interceptors, secondary and tertiary
sewers) to provide about 0.6 to 0.7 million m3/day of wastewater collection and treatment
capacity, is also scheduled for completion by 2003. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained from Shanxi that all proposed complementary works for Taiyuan water
supply and wastewater collection and treatment and associated resettlement activities
would be implemented as planned in a program acceptable to the Bank so as to be
completed by June 30, 2002. Shanxi will provide the Bank on a semiannual basis (by
each April 15 and October 15) details of the designs, financing and construction progress
for Taiyuan water supply and sewerage plans implemented in the preceding semester and
plans for construction for the 12 months ahead.
G. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
3.43  A detailed EIA was carried out by the China Institute of Radiation Protection
(CIRP) and the Shanxi University Environmental Engineering Department, with help
from foreign consultants. It was reviewed and endorsed by the National Environmental
Protection Agency of China (NEPA). Based on the Bank review and recommendations
during project preparation (November 1995 and May 1996), the reports were improved
and the EIA was submitted to the Bank in July 1996. CIRP prepared an English
summary of the report, which will be circulated to the Board on October 12, 1996.
3.44  The EIA reviewed the need for water in the Taiyuan area; the availability of water
for diversion (Annex 16); impacts along the delivery system (resettlement, assurance of
continued delivery, maintenance of water quality, disposal of tunnel excavations and
siltation problems); use of imported water and water pollution. It also specified needs for
overall environmental monitoring, an environmental management plan (EMP) and
training needs (see Annex 5).



- 29 -
3.45  The studies indicated the project had overwhelming positive affects because it
would address the scarcity of water.  At present, average urban household gross
consumption is 45 liters/capita/day, which is 41 percent of China's average, and 29
percent of the world average. Industrial water use is limited to 60 percent of demand and
recycling has reached the limits of technology. The present daily shortfall is about
400,000 m3/day, of which about 200,000 m /day are supplied by overextracting
groundwater. This has caused the groundwater to drop to over 100 m in many places and
very severe land subsidence in the city of up to 3 m. The groundwater depletion has also
caused several local streams in the Fen River Basin to dry up.
3.46  Hence, any measures to introduce water from the Yellow River will help to reduce
the human distress and improve living conditions in the city. In addition, reducing the
use of groundwater will halt land subsidence and improve the flows in small streams.
3.47  The EIA identified several potential impacts, of which only two have significant
potential negative impacts if not properly managed: (a) resettlement of a small number of
people and (b) the increased wastewater generated from the introduction of large volumes
of water to the city. However, with the proposed control measures, the net impacts for
both situations will be positive.
3.48  In addition, although most of the project works will be underground, they will
affect some surface areas due to land acquisition for tunnel crossings in river valleys and
for earth spoil disposal (from tunnel excavation) and health hazards to workers on
construction sites. The health hazards to workers and disposal of tunnel spoil can be
offset by straightforward control measures available in China and these will be applied in
the project. Because 1,204 individuals will be affected by land acquisition, a resettlement
plan was prepared in accordance to OD 4.3 (see paras. 3.50-3.57), to offset negative
impacts.
3.49  To ameliorate the wastewater problem, a detailed wastewater treatment and
management plan was developed and funding sources identified; as a result, by 2002 (one
year after water arrives in Taiyuan), 89 percent (42 percent in STW's and 37 percent in
lagoons) of the wastewater will be treated and by 2010, 100 percent (74 percent in STW's
and 26 percent in lagoons). In addition, a Water Pollution Control and Industrial Waste
Management Program was incorporated into the project [see paras. 3.2(c) and 3.3]; by
2002, the water quality of the Fen River in Taiyuan will be improved from class V to
class IV, and by 2010, to class IV. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that
YRDPC will employ by September 15, 1997 an independent environment/resettlement
panel of experts to review and make recommendations with respect to the EMP. Further,
it shall maintain an Environmental Management Office with competent staff in adequate
numbers and with responsibilities and functions acceptable to the Bank to manage,
coordinate and monitor the EMP. Also, it shall ensure that all activities under the
project will comply with the EMP.



- 30 -
H. LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT
3.50  Project Impacts. The project entails acquisition of land and the resettlement of
those affected. YRDPC conducted a detailed census, with the help of counties, towns and
villages; based on the results, acquisitions will involve 7,393 mu (440 ha) of permanently
held agricultural land, 2,495 mu (166 ha) of temporarily leased agricultural land, and 23
small enterprises. It will also involve the resettlement of 54 individuals in 16 households.
About 1,204 persons will lose land, the 16 households have lost their dwellings, and 273
employees will be affected due to the relocation of their enterprises. The resettlement
impacts are described in Annex 6.
3.51   Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). To mitigate these adverse impacts, YRDPC
prepared a comprehensive strategy for implementation and submitted it to the Bank. The
RAP includes: (a) a detailed census of all people and assets affected; (b) the legal
framework for land acquisition; (c) a framework for implementation (objectives for land
acquisition and resettlement, compensation policies and rates, preferential policies, etc.);
(d) institutional arrangements; (e) costs and budgets; (f) an implementation schedule; (g)
participation and consultations; (h) grievance procedures; and (i) monitoring and
evaluation. The RAP covers all works including the resettlement and compensation of
the people affected by the project. The RAP, which the Bank found satisfactory, is
summarized in Annex 6.
3.52  Resettlement Strategy. The strategy was designed to ensure the standard of
living of all those affected will be improved or, at the least, restored. To achieve this
goal, the following principles were incorporated into the RAP.
(a)   Land acquisition and resettlement should be minimized as much as
possible;
(b)   Compensation for structures should be at replacement cost without
depreciation;
(c)   Compensation should be paid to the collectives before land acquisition and
used for productive purposes;
(d)   All infrastructure affected will be replaced;
(e)   Priority in job opportunities with the project will be given to those affected
by the project;
(f)    Land will be redistributed to farmers who lose land due to the project;
(g)   All affected enterprises will be helped to relocate and workers will be
given an allowance during relocation;



- 31 -
(h)   Those affected will be invited to participate in preparing  and
implementing the RAP; and
(i)   Those affected will be able to redress their grievances.
3.53  Resettlement Costs. These costs, which were included in the project, total an
estimated Y 51.33 million (which involve physical and price contingencies).
3.54 Implementation Arrangements. YRDPC is responsible for implementing the
entire resettlement component. It has a resettlement office to carry out the planning,
designing, budgeting, and coordination with the county resettlement offices (CROs). The
YRDPC resettlement office (YRDPCRO) has three field offices with 3 to 5 staff to
coordinate land acquisition, contract with local government, supervise resettlement
progress and support the CROs and township resettlement offices (TROs). The CROs
and TROs each have 5 to 10 staff and are responsible for implementing the land
acquisition, livelihood development programs, and compensation to those being resettled.
TMWC will be responsible for all resettlement and compensation of people affected by
the complementary works.
3.55  The RAP will be carried out in a highly participatory manner, and those affected
will be consulted at each stage in the planning and implementation; avenues for
redressing grievances were established at all levels. At present, all 54 individuals have
been resettled; several others who lost land received new land and many have started
agricultural production and sideline industries. YRDPC's monitoring indicates the
incomes of those affected have increased substantially (Table 3.2).  A detailed
implementation program is presented in Annex 6.

3.56  Monitoring and Evaluation. Monitoring of resettlement will occur at three
levels. First, YRDPC will conduct bimonthly internal reviews of land acquisition, civil
works, land development and redistribution, off-farm activities, restoration of public
facilities, training of CRO and TRO staff and the welfare of all project-affected people
(PAP). Second, an independent monitoring institution will conduct external reviews.
Yellow River Conservancy Commission Resettlement Office (YRCCRO), which was
selected as the independent monitor, will review the physical progress, PAP livelihood

proposed measures for improvement. YRCCRO will submit semiannual monitoring
reports to YRDPC and Bank. Third, a seven-member international/local panel will meet
twice a year to review the resettlement progress and propose measures for improvement.
It will submit reports of its findings to YRDPC and the Bank.
3.57  During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Shanxi that resettlement
agencies at the provincial, county and township levels will carry out the resettlement
under the project according to the RAP. YRDPC will (a) also carry out resettlement
according to the RAP; (b) employ an independent monitoring institution by September
15, 1997, acceptable to the Bank, to evaluate the socioeconomic progress of those
affected by resettlement, (c) employ an independent panel of environment/ resettlement
experts by September 15, 1997, satisfactory to the Bank, to review the resettlement
semiannually (see para. 3.49); (d) promptly furnish to the Bank, for comment, reports of
the findings and recommendations of both groups; and (e) implement all
recommendations for follow-up actions, taking account of the Bank's comments.
I. STATUS OF PROJECT PREPARATION
3.58  Detailed designs have been completed for tunnels in GMT and SMT, underground
pumphouses, aqueducts, culverts and other structures linking tunnels. Tunnels 6 to 11 on
the GMT are already under construction (see para. 3.18). These designs, which form
about 80 percent of all civil works, were reviewed by the Bank and found to be
satisfactory. Bank missions also reviewed preliminary designs for the connecting works
and the complementary works for water supply for Taiyuan. Feasibility studies for
sewerage works and treatment were reviewed and found satisfactory. During appraisal,
the mission reviewed the detailed design for these components. All land acquisition for
construction for the GMT was completed; land acquisition for the SMT has started and
will be completed in 1998.
3.59  Designs for electrical and mechanical works pumps, motors and controls were
also completed, reviewed by the Bank and found satisfactory. The design for the
SCADA system will be completed by December 1997.
3.60 Prequalification documents for international competitive bidding (ICB) works for
the two underground pump stations and all tunnels on the SMT were completed, and were
reviewed and approved by the Bank. Bids for the tunnels and pump caverns have been
received and are being evaluated (see para. 3.69).  YRDPC has advertised in
Development Business and China Daily for prequalification of mechanical contractors,
which will be completed in June 1997. The Bank is reviewing the bidding documents for
electrical/mechanical works and these will be completed by June 1997.
3.61  Detailed proposals were also received for the technical assistance (TA) for Water
Sector Institutional Reform and Water Pollution Control and Industrial Management.
These proposals were found to be satisfactory.

J. CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE
3.62  Construction of preparatory work for SMT started in 1994 and should be
completed in early 1997. At Pingguan, located close to tunnel 8 of GMT, YRDPC has
constructed a large field office for design and construction supervision. In addition, there
are several site offices already constructed along the SMT for receiving contractors.
Contract award for all major civil works contracts should be completed after Board
approval, expected in July 1997.
3.63   The main civil works construction will start in September 1997 and will be
completed in July 2002, after about five years (see Annex 10 for a detailed schedule). A
six-month commissioning period will be required before water can actually be supplied to
the city. Taiyuan will complete all its works by the end of 2002 to receive water. The
proposed schedule is considered reasonable and attainable. A detailed program of project
supervision is presented in Annex 13. The monitoring of all key construction activities is
presented in Annex 10.
K. PROJECT COST ESTIMATES
3.64  The total costs of this phase of the project are estimated to be $1,351.6 million
equivalent, of which $492.9 million (36 percent) represents the foreign exchange
component. Annex 2 contains, in detail, the estimated costs of the project, which are
summarized in Table 3.3. The project base costs are in February 1997 prices. These
costs include interest during construction and commitment charges of $63.8 million. The
tunnel and other underground works costs are based on ongoing works where
international contractors have bid. The costs of electrical and mechanical equipment,
transformers and gates are based on recent quotations from manufacturers and suppliers'
prices for similar equipment and materials. The costs of the remaining items are based on
the consulting engineers' data for similar works. Physical contingencies are assumed as
follows:  10 percent for the aboveground works; 15 percent for the tunnels and
underground works; 10 percent for the remaining preparatory works, contract
administration, technical assistance, environmental management, studies and training;
and 10 percent for the electromechanical equipment. These percentages are considered to
be reasonable in view of the site features, the stage of design, and the contracts ongoing at
the site. The price escalation for costs expressed in foreign exchange (US dollars) has
been calculated in accordance with the anticipated international price escalation of 1.7
percent for 1997, 2.2 percent for 1998, and 2.5 percent for 1999 and thereafter. The price
escalation for costs expressed in local currency is calculated according to projected local
inflation rates of 6.2, 5.8, and 5.5 percent for 1997, 1998 and 1999 and thereafter,
respectively.

L. FINANCING PLAN
3.65      The financing proposed for the project is shown in Table 3.4.  To enable timely
and effective implementation of the project, it is necessary to ensure an adequate flow of
local funds, as shown  in  Annex  2.  YRDPC  will derive  all its counterpart funds from
surcharges on coal, electricity and water supplied. The surcharge collection was established
in 1993 and about $240 million had been collected up to 1995. Collection in 1995 was
$115 million and it is expected a slightly greater amount will be collected per year in 1996-
2001. The surcharge collections are fairly well-established and should not pose any major
issues  for counterpart fumding.   During  negotiations,  assurances  were  obtained  that
YRDPC would submit to the Bank by December 15 of each year the financing plan and the
proposed implementation program for the next year as approved by the Government, and
thereafter implement this program, taking into account the Bank's views on it.

3.66  China is eligible for single currency loans under the Bank's expanded program.
GOC and Shanxi Province have selected LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loan
terms for the project in order to facilitate management of the foreign exchange risk of
their borrowing by more closely matching the currency of their liabilities with their net
trade flows, about 80 percent of which are US dollar denominated. They selected the
LIBOR-based product in order to preserve the full maturity of this loan, compared to the
fixed-rate option that would have resulted in a shorter maturity. The Borrower judges
that it can manage any interest risk. The loan of $400 million would be for 20 years,
including a 5-year grace period at the standard rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single
currency loans. The proceeds of the loan would be onlent from the GOC through the
Shanxi Government to YRDPC with the same terms as the Bank loan. At negotiations,
an assurance was obtained from Shanxi that it would onlend the proceeds of the Bank
loan (other than for the Institutional Support Program for Shanxi Government) to
YRDPC, under a subsidiary loan agreement with a 20-year term, including 5 years of
grace at the same interest rate and commitment fee as those paid by the Borrower. The
execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between Shanxi and YRDPC, satisfactory to the
Bank, would be a condition of effectiveness of the loan.
3.67  A small portion of the financing is from official bilateral sources for pipe-making
equipment, consultants and for special steel for the pipes.  Since the funds are not
immediately required, it is not proposed to have a cross-effectiveness clause in the loan
agreement. However, we propose to have a cross-default clause; in the event the funds do
not become available by July 1, 1998 or there is a suspension or cancellation of the
cofinancing, the Borrower is obligated to cover the shortfall in funds.
M. PROCUREMENT
3.68  The procurement arrangements for the project have followed the Bank's
"Guidelines for Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published in January
1995 and revised in January and August 1996, as well as experience gained from
previous Bank infrastructure projects in China. The Standard Bidding Documents
(SBDs), which have been agreed between the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the Bank in
August 1996, would be adopted for all international competitive bidding (ICB) and
national competitive bidding (NCB) for civil works and goods. For the appointment of
consultants, the Bank's Model Contract Agreement for Consultants would be used. The
main items to be procured are: (a) the main civil works; (b) electrical and mechanical
equipment; and (c) engineering and consulting services. The procurement arrangements
for the proposed projects are summarized in Table 3.5.

3.69  Civil Works. All contracts for civil works valued at $10 million equivalent or
above would use ICB procedures. There will be eight lots of civil works contracts (see
Annex 3). The procurement of the main civil works, through ICB procedures, has been
divided into three lots, with a total value of $328 million, one for the underground pump
stations and two sets of tunnels for the SMTs and aqueducts and culverts. These contracts
would be mainly financed by the proposed Bank loan. All civil works contracts will require
prequalification. A Disputes Review Board will be included in contracts valued at $50
million or more. The prequalification documents have been reviewed by the Bank and the
prequalifications have been implemented by YRDPC. A total of 10 prequalified contractors
have tendered for ICB bids and the bids are being evaluated. Bidding documents for these
main civil works have been reviewed in the Bank. All other civil works (16 contracts),
valued at $69.6 million, will be financed under NCB procedures because they are
distributed and small in nature and not of interest to foreign contractors.
3.70  Goods. All contracts for goods valued at $1 million equivalent or more would be
awarded under ICB procedures. Concrete pipes, pumps, electric motors, mechanical works
and control systems valued at $130.4 million (three lots) will also be procured using ICB
procedures. Qualified domestic manufacturers would be eligible for a margin of preference
of 15 percent of CIF prices or the actual customs duties, whichever is lower, in the bid
evaluation. Items estimated to cost less than $1 million equivalent will use NCB
procedures up to an aggregate total of $59.7 million. The proposed Bank loan would also
finance environmental and hydrologic forecasting equipment for $4.3 million, which would
be procured through limited international bidding (LIB) procedures following the Bank's
Guidelines. LIB procedures are being used because of the specialized nature of the
equipment. Items or groups of items estimated to cost less than the equivalent of $300,000
per contract, up to an aggregate amount of $3.1 million, may be purchased on the basis of at
least three quotations from qualified suppliers eligible under the Bank's procurement
guidelines for national shopping.
3.71  Procurement Review. All contract packages for works and goods financed by the
Bank and estimated to cost $10.0 million equivalent or more for works, $1.0 million
equivalent or more for goods and consultant contracts valued at $100,000 equivalent or
more for firms and $50,000 equivalent or more for individuals would be subject to the
Bank's prior review (about 95 percent of the loan). In addition, the first three NCB
contracts less than $10.0 million in value for works and $1.0 million in value for goods will
be subject to the Bank's prior review.
3.72  Consultants.  Consultants are needed for construction supervision, detailed
design, reviews, engineering and environment panels, institutional reform and training. A
detailed list is provided in Table 3.6. All consultants would be selected in accordance
with principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank on the basis of the "Guidelines
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers," January 1997.
YRDPC will retain the present international consultants for detail design (210 person-
months) who have prepared the feasibility study, the detailed designs and bidding
documents, on grounds of intimate knowledge of the site, river hydrology, local



- 38 -
construction conditions, and the overall project in the interests of project safety,
economy, efficiency and expediency. The consultants have also been involved in
evaluation for prequalifying of contractors and will be involved in bid evaluation with
YRDPC. The consultant services for construction supervision for tunnels and pump
caverns (479 person-months), connecting works pipelines (200 person-months) and for
the environmental master plan (75 person-months) for Taiyuan City would be procured
using competitive procedures (QCBS) following the Guidelines. The $0.8 million of
consultancy for institutional support is a quality-based service, which is highly
specialized and needs intimate knowledge of Chinese and local practices. Another $2.2
million of consultants for engineering design panels, environmental/resettlement panels,
groundwater monitoring, etc. will be individual consultants.

N. DISBURSEMENT
3.73   The proposed Bank loan of $400 million would be disbursed over a period of five
years as detailed in Table 3.7. For expenditures relating to training, and contracts for
works valued at less than $10.0 million equivalent other than the first three, goods valued
at less than $1.0 million equivalent other than the first three, services valued at less than
$100,000 equivalent for firms and $50,000 for individual consultants, training, and clean
technology pollution fund subloan reimbursements would be made on the basis of
Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). Documentation supporting the SOEs would be
retained by YRDPC and made available for review by Bank supervision missions. To
facilitate disbursements, a Special Account in US dollars, with an authorized allocation of
$15 million (less than four months of average eligible expenditures), will be established



- 39 -
in a bank and on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. Applications for
replenishment would be submitted monthly or when the amounts withdrawn are equal to
50 percent of the authorized allocation, whichever occurs sooner. Retroactive financing
in an aggregate amount of $28 million would be provided under the loan to cover
payments made for expenditures on civil works, urgently needed goods, consultant
services, and training incurred before signing the Loan Agreement, but after October 20,
1996.

3.74   The disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank loan is given in Annex 4,
Table 1. The disbursement period covers the first phase of the construction period. The
disbursements profile for this project varies slightly from the agriculture sector profiles.
There is a slow startup because of the time taken by large civil works contractors to
mobilize. However, once mobilization is completed, the disbursement proceeds rapidly,
and it conforms with the disbursement profile of other agricultural projects (see Annex4).
The disbursement schedule is based on the detailed project implementation program. The
loan is expected to be fully disbursed by June 30, 2003.



- 40 -
0. PROJECT MONITORING, REPORTING AND SUPERVISION
3.75  Supervision. The project would be supervised through Bank missions whose
frequency would be guided by the progress of the works. However, on the average, a
mission at about nine-month intervals would be mounted; a Supervision Mission Plan is
presented in Annex 13. In addition to field missions, staff input would be provided at
Headquarters for project-related activities such as completion of supervision reports,
procurement documentation and contracts, staff training and equipment proposals and
follow-up and review of the studies on water sector institutional reforms, industrial waste
management and antipollution fund utilization. Moreover, the Bank would monitor
progress of implementation of all project components through quarterly progress reports
to be submitted to the Bank. It is estimated that over the implementation period of the
project the total time expended on supervision would be in the order of 100 person-
weeks.
3.76  Monitoring.   During implementation, project performance, including the
achievement of physical targets and attainment of other project objectives will be
monitored by YRDPC through the use of performance indicators, reports on the
environment and land acquisition and resettlement, progress reports and auditing of
project accounts. In addition, upon completion, the project will be reviewed in an
Implementation Completion Report.  Annex 12 presents the proposed monitoring
indicators for the project. Each of the project components' indices will track annual
progress in attaining targets during implementation and impact objectives after the project
is completed. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that YRDPC shall, by April 30
of each year and for three years after completion of the project, furnish to the Bank an
annual monitoring report, in a format acceptable to the Bank, covering all components of
the project, in conformance with the agreed monitoring indicators. In addition, YRDPC
will provide semiannual progress reports by April 15 and October 15 of the project
implementation in the previous semester including any revisions to the project or its RAP
or EMP.
3.77  Reporting. Based on the monitoring activities described in Annex 13, YRDPC
will submit to the Bank an annual monitoring report. This report will be based on the
following reports, which will be submitted to the Bank during the course of a given year:
(a)   Annual environmental monitoring reports during the construction phase.
(b)   A  series of internal and external (independent) monitoring reports
assessing the impact of land acquisition and resettlement on various
segments of the local population, describing the income restoration
strategies followed and the number of people compensated (para. 3.56 and
Annex 6).
(c)   Annual audit reports for the project accounts and financial statements
(para. 3.79).



- 41 -
(d)   Semiannual progress reports for all project activities and up-to-date
performance indicators.
(e)   A Project Implementation Completion Report would be prepared and
submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the loan closing date.
P. ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS
3.78  Accounting. Up to now, YRDPC has maintained two sets of accounts, one set for
capital construction and the other for operation. Since these two sets of accounts are not
consolidated, the balance sheet for operations does not include construction work-in-
progress and related financing. However, under the newly revised general principles set
forth by the Ministry of Finance, enterprises will have to consolidate the capital
construction accounts with the operations accounts. YRDPC will consolidate its accounts
and special technical assistance using foreign consultants has been included as part of the
project to help do this.
3.79  Auditing. Audits of Bank-financed projects have been conducted by the Shanxi
Provincial Audit Bureau (SPAB) under the guidance of the State Audit Administration
(SAA). This arrangement is satisfactory. Assurances were obtained from YRDPC and
Shanxi (for the Institutional Components for Water Sector Institutional Reform and Water
Pollution Control and Industrial Waste Management) that they would maintain separate
accounts for the project and that the audited project accounts of Shanxi and the audited
financial statements of YRDPC and Shanxi Government would be furnished to the Bank
within six months after the end of each fiscal year. The Borrower would arrange for audits
of the Special Account and the details of withdrawals from the loan account made on the
basis of SOEs and the auditor's opinion as to whether such withdrawals were made against
expenditures eligible for disbursement by the Bank. Audited financial statements would
also be required to be furnished to Shanxi (for forwarding to the Bank on request) by
enterprises borrowing subloans under the clean technology pollution fund. YRDPC has
developed an internal auditing section (staffed with chartered accountants), which
periodically will examine the accounts of each operating unit. The objective of these
examinations is primarily to test for accuracy and compliance with Ministry of Finance
regulations. The section will serve as liaison between external auditors and the project
entity. The Bank will review the internal auditing function during project implementation
with a view toward increasing its efficiency and usefulness to YRDPC.

4. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. PROJECT ORGANIZATION
4.1    General Structure. The Government of Shanxi Province (GSP) will take overall
responsibility for implementing the project. Recognizing the project's importance and
complexity, and based on successful experiences elsewhere in the country, the GSP
created the Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project Headquarters (WWTPH) to guide the
project management office(s) and coordinate the construction and resettlement efforts of
related organizations and authorities. The general organization of the project is shown in
Annex 9.
4.2   The main role of WWTPH, which is headed by the Vice Governor of Shanxi
Province and made up of representatives from various key departments of the province, is
to oversee the Wanjiazhai Yellow River Diversion Project Corporation (YRDPC) in
policy and fiscal matters, as well as project construction and resettlement, and to
coordinate issues and problem resolution at the provincial level.
4.3   Project Management Office (PMO). YRDPC, whose function is to build,
operate and maintain the project, has established a PMO for the project. Originally
known as the Yellow River Diversion Project Bureau (YRDPB), YRDPC was initially set
up as an administrative organization of the provincial government, in order to have easy
access to other government organizations and authorities. In 1994, it was approved by
the provincial government and registered as a state-owned enterprise.  Its general
manager, the former director of the Planning Commission of Shanxi Province, reports
directly to WWTPH and the provincial government. At present, it has 734 staff and more
(up to 1,500) will be added during the construction and operational phases. Although
YRDPC was formed recently, its key personnel have been involved in the construction
and/or operation of similar projects, or involved in the planning and preparation of this
project; thus, it is capable of managing the project's construction and operations. The
PMO will cooperate with agencies in charge of resettlement, in order to coordinate the
project's resettlement component. Further, it has worked out a plan for progressively
reforming the corporation from an administrative organization to an economic enterprise
during the life of the project. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that
YRDPC will maintain its project management office with competent staff in adequate
numbers and it will have responsibility andfunctions satisfactory to the Bank.
B. PROJECT EXECUTION AND SUPERVISION OF CONSTRUCTION
4.4   YRDPC will execute the project, acting as the employer. It will be responsible for
preparing and executing all bids for civil works, goods and services; also, for managing
construction, cost and quality control of all civil works and the installation of plant and



- 43 -
equipment. It will be assisted by the Wanjiazhai Project Supervision Joint Venture
(WPSJV), comprised of six organizations, which will supervise construction; by the
Tianjin Investigation and Design Institute (TIDI) and Shanxi Investigation and Design
Institute (SIDI), which will oversee design and design changes; by foreign and local
consultants, which will assist in managing the contract, as well as cost and quality
control. Also, a panel of experts (POE, para. 4.8) will review design changes and any
special construction problems semiannually. In addition, a dispute review board (DRB,
para. 4.10) will be appointed to resolve any disputes that arise with the contractors (see
Annex 9).
4.5   Construction Supervision. WPSJV will act as Engineer ' for the Employer and
be responsible for supervising daily and detailed fieldwork for quality control, certifying
payments to contractors, maintaining a field laboratory for testing materials delivered to
the site, and revising design documents/drawings according to field conditions. Its six
supervision organizations are licensed and have experience with the construction and
supervision of similar projects. With support from YRDPC and assistance from the
consultants, WPSJV will have the capability required to mange the construction of such a
complex and large project. The organization of WPSJV is shown in Annex 9. At
negotiations, assurances were obtained that YRDPC will continue to employ an Engineer
with qualifications, experience and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank in order to
undertake the construction supervision.
4.6   Engineering Design and Technical Assistance.  Having been retained by
YRDPC, TIDI is assisting with the design of civil and electromechanical works from the
inlet to the end of tunnels to Daliang Reservoir on the north main line and the end of the
south main line; SIDI is assisting with the design of civil and electromechanical works
from Daliang Reservoir, including the reservoir, to the end of the north main line and
connection works, starting from Fen-] Reservoir. Both are experienced institutes and
have recently designed some large- and mid-scaled hydro projects.
4.7   Nevertheless, YRDPC recognizes the very complex and delicate nature of the
construction and will therefore continue to use international consultants during
implementation. International engineering consultants have also been actively involved
in reviewing the project design and resolving specific technical matters related to the
pump station, TBM technology, tunneling and electromechanical equipment/plant. A
number of technical delegations and prominent tunnel and electromechanical experts
have visited the project site, offered valuable suggestions and shared their experiences
with their Chinese counterparts in building large and complex projects.
4.8   Panel of Experts.  YRDPC will continue to employ a POE, comprised of
international and domestic specialists, to help resolve particular technical problems
"Engineer" as defined in the Bank's Standard Bidding Document for Procurement of Works, January
1996.



- 44 -
related to the project and advise on major design and construction issues. The POE,
which has effectively reviewed the project's major technical issues, has been funded by
YRDPC. Under the proposed project, the POE would meet regularly. At negotiations, an
assurance was obtained from YRDPC that it will employ a POE by September 30, 1997
that is independent from the project's designers, that the POE will conduct, at least twice
annually or more frequently as needed, reviews of designs and technical specifications
and advise on unforeseen problems relating to project implementation, and that YRDPC
will report the POE's findings to the Bank and Borrower on a semiannual basis.
4.9   Foreign Consultants. Due to the project's magnitude and complexity, and the
use of international civil contractors and equipment suppliers, YRDPC will appoint
experienced and qualified international consultants who will play a key role in assisting
YRDPC and WPSJV to manage project construction. Their scope of work will include
contract management, cost control, scheduling, and construction site administration
during the entire implementation period. The total input of engineering services and
technical assistance is estimated to be about 679 person-months of foreign consultants'
services, which is considered reasonable for a project of this sort (see Annex 14).
4.10 Dispute Review Board (DRB). Based on the experience with other projects
involving international contractors in China, YRDPC recognizes the need to have a DRB
to help it resolve the conflicts that emerge during construction between the employer and
contractors. Therefore, YRDPC and the contractors will jointly employ a DRB to resolve
such disputes.
4.11  The procedures for inspecting, maintaining and monitoring the safety of
underground/civil works in China generally follow international practices and are
considered satisfactory for the proposed project.
4.12 Environmental Management Plan (EMP). For the project works, the EMP will
be implemented by YRDPC's Environmental Management Office (EMO), whose
functions would be to ensure that all contractors adhere to the relevant environmental
specifications in their contracts.  The EMO will also monitor the environmental
parameters for air, water and land in the construction and resettlement sites.
C. OVERALL COORDINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OTHER COMPONENTS
4.13  Resettlement Coordination. Various agencies and jurisdictions, at different
levels, are responsible for resettlement; thus, coordination will be essential and will be
carried out by two agencies. As the owner of the project, YRDPC will supervise and
coordinate resettlement activities through WWTPH. YRDPC will also be responsible for
channeling resettlement funds to the local governments' resettlement agencies. For this
reason, it has set up a Resettlement Office to maintain close liaison between the
Provincial Resettlement Bureau and local governments at various levels, as well as to
supervise and coordinate the program. And, since the GSP has ultimate authority for
resettlement and bears the responsibility for the welfare of its citizens, its Provincial



- 45 -
Resettlement Bureau will also be involved in coordinating the various local government
agencies and provincial departments.
D. OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT
4.14  Institutional Components.  The Water Sector Institutional Reform will be
carried out by SCSR, SWCD and SBPC (see para. 3.30). A large coordination working
group convened by SWCD will be involved in working out details of this component.
The larger group will consist of Taiyuan City municipal agencies such as TMWC,
Municipal Commission, Water Saving Office, etc.
4.15  The Water Pollution Control and Industrial Waste Component would be carried
out by the Taiyuan EPB under the guidance of the Provincial EPB.
4.16  YRDPC's organizational arrangement for project operations and maintenance
(O&M) will be quite different than for construction: Its operational departments will be
created about two years before the first phase of the project is completed. YRDPC's
organization will be transformed gradually to have the capability to operate and maintain
the entire system. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that YRDPC will
prepare under guidelines acceptable to the Bank and furnish to the Bank a program by
June 30, 1999 for smooth transformation of YRDPC from a construction entity to an
operating entity and thereafter will implement this plan, taking into account the Bank's
comments on this matter. The plan will have details of the new organizational structure,
staffing numbers and qualifications, and training programs for staff to make the
transition.

5. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
A. WATER RESOURCES AND SUPPLY ENTITIES
5.1   YRDPC is responsible for construction of the proposed project, including the
general main tunnel, pumping stations, south main line, and connection works [see para
3.2 (a)]. YRDPC was registered as a corporation in December 1995, and will become the
executing agency to operate and manage the project upon completion of construction.
YRDPC is also responsible for providing investment capital for the Shanxi Government's
share in the Wanjiazhai Dam.
5.2   To receive diverted water from YRDPC, TMWC will need to expand its treatment
capacity by constructing the Huyan water treatment plant and installing additional
transmission/distribution pipelines in Taiyuan city by year 2002. Since the project is
designed to supply water to industrial and domestic users in Taiyuan through TMWC and
since YRDPC will be liable for repayment of the Bank loan, determination of end-user
water tariffs becomes critical as it will directly impact TMWC's ability to pay for
purchased water and in turn YRDPC's ability to repay the Bank loan. Therefore,
financial forecasts along with projected water tariffs are prepared for both YRDPC and
TMWC, and both entities shall be covered by financial covenants.
5.3   Shanxi Water Conservancy Department (SWCD) governs Fen Reservoir 1
Management Bureau (Fen-1), Fen Water Conservancy Management Bureau (FWCMB),
and Zhang Zhe Reservoir Administrative Bureau (ZZRAB). As diverted Yellow River
water will flow through Fen Reservoir 1 and Fen-1 is responsible for management and
operation of the reservoir, YRDPC will need to have an agreement (in the interim until
Fen-l is incorporated within the Fen Basin Authority) with Fen-I detailing (1)
management fee to be collected by Fen-1, and (2) entitlement of water volume by Fen-1
and YRDPC at discharge point after the proposed project is commissioning.
5.4   Fen Reservoir 2, downstream of Fen Reservoir 1, will be used to adjust Fen River
water volume during different seasons. The Fen-2 Reservoir Water Enterprise Company
Ltd. (Fen-2) will construct, own, and manage Fen Reservoir 2.
5.5   Taiyuan Groundwater Resource Management Co. (TGRM) and the Self-Supply
Tubewell Commission (SSTC) are both responsible for monitoring, licensing, and
management of groundwater resource.
B. PROJECT FINANCING
5.6   Total project cost before interest during construction (IDC) is estimated at
Y 11.52 billion for all project works. Based on such cost estimate, plus required



- 47 -
investment in Wanjiazhai Dam of Y 2.23 billion but excluding about Y 0.2 billion for
institutional reform and water pollution control components that are not under YRDPC's
responsibility, YRDPC's costs amount to Y 13.55 billion prior to IDC, or Y 14.23 billion
after IDC and the foreign exchange gain/loss is taken into account (see Annex 8,
Summary Table, page 216).
5.7   YRDPC's capital requirement during 1993 to 2001 is estimated to be Y 14.07
billion, which is Y 165 million less than the above estimated total cost of Y 14.23 as the
foreign exchange loss during construction is a noncash item caused by revaluation of
long-term loans.
5.8   The proposed project, along with other nonproject components, will be financed
mainly by GSP surcharges, the World Bank loan, a small cofinancing loan, and
investment income from Wanjiazhai Dam's net income from electricity sales. GSP
surcharges, to be collected and about Y 7.6 billion used for the project before the end of
year 2001, consist of surcharges on coal sales, provincial electricity consumption,
outbound electricity sales, and water consumption (see Annex 8). The Bank loan of
Y 3.8 billion, $400 million equivalent, and a cofinancing loan of Y 273 million, $30
million equivalent, will be borrowed by YRDPC. Because Wanjiazhai Dam is to be
completed by end- 1998 and will start to have power revenue by 1999, YRDPC will then
be entitled to investment income. Such investment income is estimated at Y 911 million
during 1999 to 2001.
5.9   Altogether, a financing gap during 1996-2001 may still exist. Such a shortage
could be financed by (a) allocation of additional water revenue derived from the water
tariff adjustment starting in 1997; (b) an adjusted water resource fee; and (c) the Shanxi
Investment and Trust Company in case of a short-term financing need.  During
negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom Shanxi that each year incremental revenues
from tariff adjustments and increased water resources fees between 1997 and 2001 will
be allocated to YRDPC by December 31 of that year as a capital contribution to YRDPC.
5.10  Huyan water treatment plant and associated pipelines in Taiyuan city will cost
Y 2.55 billion, of which Y 900 million will be financed by budgets of provincial and
municipal governments as well as by TMWC's internal cash generation; the remaining
will be funded by Japanese OECF loans.
C. PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.11  YRDPC's past financial statements for 1992-95 are presented in Annex 8. As a
construction organization, YRDPC follows "financial accounting systems for
construction units" and prepares only the capital balance statement. As of end-1995,
YRDPC had invested Y 1,134 million in project preparation and construction and Y 424
million in Wanjiazhai Dam; both are financed by GSP surcharges. Details on GSP
surcharges and YRDPC's existing financial reporting systems are described in Annex 8.



- 48 -
5.12 TMWC's past financial statements for 1992-95 are presented in Annex S. In
1995, the average water tariff for industry and domestic users in Taiyuan city was Y 1.1
and Y 0.7/mr  [value-added tax (VAT) inclusive] respectively, or Y 0.86/m3 on average
(excluding VAT). Despite increases in net income since 1994 due to water tariff
adjustment, TMWC has not kept much as retained earnings for future investment because
most net income was used for the GSP water surcharge paid to the Government. Most
capital investments such as installation of transmission pipelines are still funded by the
municipal budget rather than self-financing or borrowing. As a result, TMWC maintains
a healthy financial structure with a low outstanding liability for the past three years.
Adjustment of water tariffs is subject to government approval. Therefore, even though
TMWC has adopted an enterprise accounting system and prepares commercial financial
statements, it is not yet a financially autonomous company.
5.13 As quasi profit-making organizations, Fen-1, FWCAB, and ZZRAB are not
included in the governmental budget. For financial reporting purposes, all three bureaus
submit their own balance sheet and income statement to WSCD for aggregation. Fen- 1's
earnings are mainly from water resource fees paid by FWCAB (which is downstream on
the Fen River) and partly from electricity sales, while FWCAB's revenue is primarily
from water sales to irrigation and industries. Fen-1 charged FWCAB water resource fees
for an allocated quota for irrigation and industrial consumption at 1 fen and 10.5 fen per
m3 respectively in 1995 (the latter was increased to 15 fen in 1996). FWCAB charged
3                                   3
irrigation water consumption at 5.5 fen per m and industry consumption at 48 fen per m3.
In view of the charge limit set by the Price Bureau, both Fen-I and FWCAB have to
underprovide depreciation and incur less-than-required costs in order to ensure a small
amount of surplus for employee benefits. The imputed cost-recovery water resource fee
levels for Fen-1's water supplies to irrigation and industry are 9 fen and 18 fen per m3
and imputed FRCAB cost-recovery water prices for irrigation and industry are estimated
at 7 fen and 68 fen per m3 if necessary costs are taken into account. SWCD's past three
years' financial statements are presented in Annex 8.
D. WATER PRICING
5.14 Water pricing for YRDPC and TMWC is determined by the estimated total capital
investment cost which belongs to SMT, the estimated cost for the Huyan water treatment
plant, suggested financing plans for both YRDPC and TMWC, forecast water
transfer/supply volume, operational and financial assumptions, along with agreed
financial requirement indicators (see below and Annex 8).
5.15 The GMT cost is a common cost for SMT and NMT and thus should be shared
based on the estimated eventual water transfer volume, 56.5 percent and 43.5 percent,
respectively. Investment in Wanjiazhai Dam, also part of the capital requirement during
phase I (1993-2001), is a long-term investment, and thus is not subject to cost sharing.
5.16  The cost for SMT consists of the shared GMT cost, the cost to complete SMT,
and the cost of connection works, which in total equal 81.72 percent of total phase I



- 49 -
investment cost including capitalized interest and foreign exchange gain/loss. That is,
only 81.72 percent of total phase I cost will be considered in determination of water
tariffs for TMWC starting from year 2002; the remaining 18.28 percent of cost will
belong to NMT and will not be subject to depreciation until completion of NMT.
5.17  Phase I capital requirements will be financed through GSP surcharges as well as
borrowing. Sources of funds and their uses are assumed to be as follows:
(a)   The World Bank loan of $400 million and the cofinancing loan of $30
million will be used to finance foreign currency requirements for the
proposed project;
(b)   Investment income from Wanjiazhai Dam, assumed to be Y 911 million
during 1999-2001, can be used in project construction;
(c)    GSP surcharges can be used to finance Wanjiazhai Dam and project
activities if a shortage of funds still exists after application of the previous
two financing sources; and
(d)   If a shortage still exists, particularly during 1997-1998, additional
surcharges or incremental water revenue as a result of water tariff
adjustment will be needed.
5.18  At present, the provincial price bureau has authority to determine and adjust water
tariffs within the province. Shanxi Province is aware of the necessity of adjusting water
tariffs to recover the capital investments of the project for repayment of the loans. To
smooth out the impact on users of the impending tariff adjustment, the provincial price
bureau has decided to increase water tariffs gradually from 1997 for all users. The goal of
the proposed tariff adjustment is to price water based on operating costs and debt service
in the year 2002 when the project is put into operation (see Table 5.1). These tariffs are
essentially equal to the long-run marginal cost of water in the year 2000. It is hoped that
such a policy could further stimulate water savings and rationalize the water consumption
structure among different sectors. It should be noted the average tariff ratio for irrigation
water to industrial water is presently 1:10 and with the new tariff structure it will reduce
to 1:4 in the year 2000. These tariffs apply to TMWC-supplied water, which covers the
Yellow River-diverted water and groundwater supplied by TMWC. However, there is
also self-supplied groundwater by industries and enterprises, which is now priced at much
lower tariffs and controlled by the Water Savings Office of Taiyuan Municipality.
During negotiation, assurances were obtainedfrom Shanxi that it would prepare, on the
basis of guidelines acceptable to the Bank. (a) a program by February 15, 1998 to
ensure that, by June 30, 2002, self-supplied groundwater would have the same tariffs as
for all other water supplied in Shanxi; and (b) a program by June 15, 1998 to ensure that
groundwater extraction would also be limited to safe yield levels. Shanxi would
thereafter implement these programs, taking into account the Bank's comments on them.



- 50 -
5.19  Water sales were 144 million m3 in 1995 and therefore the additional water
revenue caused by the above pricing reform action plan would amount to more than Y 1
billion between 1997 and 2000. The provincial price bureau intends to use this additional
revenue to finance either YRDPC or water supply projects within Taiyuan city, or deposit
it partially as a debt repayment fund. Because water tariffs should cover the debt
repayment component after project commissioning, and because financing plans for
YRDPC and TMWC indicate both organizations are short of local counterpart funds for
their investments, it would be more justified if this additional water revenue were used
for both YRDPC and TMWC's project investment instead of debt repayment.

5.20  With a view to obtaining economic efficiency and promoting prudent financial
management, at negotiations assurances were obtained that financial performance
indices for YRDPC and TMWCs' water supply operations will meet the following
requirements:
(a)   YRDPC would take all measures, including but not limited to tariff
adjustments, to ensure a debt service coverage ratio of no less than 1.2
throughout the whole debt repayment period (2003-16), and a rate of
return on two-year average notionally revalued net fixed assets in service
of no less than 2 percentfor year 2011-16.
(b)   Shanxi Province would cause TMWC to take all measures, including but
not limited to tariff adjustments, to ensure that (1) debt/equity ratio is
better than 70/30 between 1997 and 2001, (2) a debt service coverage
ratio of no less than 1.2 is achieved between 2002 and 2016 when YRDPC
is paying off its subsidiary loan; and (3) a rate of return on two-year
notionally revalued net fixed assets in service of no less than 2 percent is
achievedfor the same period of 2002 and thereafter.
E. FUTURE FINANCES
5.21  Table 5.2 illustrates the YRDPC's financial projection summary of a simulated
case in which the NMT and all possible investments after year 2002 are excluded. This



- 51 -
simulation indicates the projected water tariffs to be charged by YRDPC to TMWC.
Between 2002 and 2004, rate of return on fixed assets is estimated to be negative due to
projected net losses in such years. Despite forecast net loss, the minimum debt service
coverage ratio of 1.2 can still be met during these years because internal cash generations
(mainly from depreciation) are sufficient to cover principal repayments.
5.22    The  comprehensive  financial projections  for YRDPC  (both  for the  proposed
project and for the full project including the NMT) and TMWC for 1996-2006 are
presented in Annex 8, and summarized in Table 5.3 and Table 5.4 below. Those
projections are based on the assumptions contained in Annex 8, which include pricing
mechanisms and water tariff adjustments needed to allow YRDPC and TMWC to achieve
the above financial performance targets. In Table 5.4, the average tariff before year 2002
is the tariff that should be maintained by TMWC for its investment needs, not the higher
tariffs suggested by the tariff reform action plan.

5.23   Sensitivity analysis (see Annex 8) shows that projected water tariffs for YRDPC
and TMWC will be more sensitive to the accuracy of estimated water transfer volume. It
emphasizes the importance of timely completion of the proposed project as well as Huyan
water treatment plant-both phase I and phase II. The system's ability to transfer water
as scheduled and to have an estimated matching capacity to receive transferred water is
critical to realization of the estimated water transfer volume by YRDPC and water supply
volume by TMWC. Reduction in investment income from Wanjiazhai Dam would also
make the projected tariffs higher, because additional water tariff adjustment would be
needed should YRDPC have weaker capability to meet the financial covenants. Cost
overrun of Huyan water treatment plant's phase I cost would impact tariffs by TMWC



- 53 -
since in the current projection model it is assumed that any shortage of funds after
availing of financing from the provincial and municipal governments and TMWC's
internal cash generation will be financed by borrowing.
5.24  The sensitivity analysis shows that the proposed tariffs for YRDPC and TMWC
are less sensitive to cost overrun of the proposed project as it is assumed that a shortage
of capital (after drawing down the World Bank loan, cofinancing loan, investment
income, and GSP surcharges) will be financed by additional surcharges or funds from the
provincial government free of charge. With regard to the proposed reused water, if the
tariff is set at Y 1.5/m3 instead of Y 0.2 as currently assumed, the projected tariffs for
YRDPC and TMWC will drop by about Y 0.5. Therefore, water reuse mechanisms,
including construction and rehabilitation of wastewater treatment plants in Taiyuan and
water allocation and pricing schemes, need to be put in place as early as possible.
F. FUTURE REFORM
5.25  The existing water resource and supply institutions have different priorities in
water allocation, different levels of financial autonomy, and various reporting systems.
These differences have resulted in problems such as insufficient maintenance, lower-than-
market-price tariffs, rigid pricing mechanisms, and questionable water allocations. Water
has to be managed in all its forms from rainfall in the catchment to reaching the sea, with
proper controls through a licensing system. Licenses for surface water or groundwater
abstraction as well as licenses for the return of water to the river basin are necessary to
address allocation problems. Water reuse, time of use, and quality of water should all be
reflected in water pricing. Establishment of an Upper Fen River Basin Corporation
(UFRBC) is thus envisioned under the project, with responsibility for regulatory
functions such as management and administration of a unified licensing and charging
system in Shanxi Province for the Fen River.
5.26  Reforms in financial aspects other than the pricing system are also required. All
water resource and supply institutions and enterprises, to different degrees, should
strengthen their financial viability by gaining better skills in financial, operational, and
capital investment planning, having power to borrow and invest, having rights to propose
tariff adjustment, retaining any revenue surplus for future use, and having the power to
hire and fire.
5.27  Along with institutional and financial reforms, transition from  the current
reporting systems to a unified reporting system in line with international accounting
practices is needed not only for project monitoring but also for better analysis of financial
and operating performance.  All water sector institutions and enterprises, whether
involved in construction or operation, should be able to provide easily understandable
financial reports or consolidated accounts.
5.28  Terms of reference for the proposed institutional study and financial strengthening
are presented in Annex 8.

6. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATIONS AND RISK
A. GENERAL
6.1   The primary motivation for Phase I of the proposed project is to alleviate severe
water shortages in Shanxi's Province's capital and main industrial center Taiyuan, and its
surrounding areas.
6.2   In 1993, water demands were estimated to be 33.5 percent greater than water
available from sustainable local supplies. By 2000, the deficit will be 50 percent and
continue to grow thereafter. Current water deficits in Taiyuan constrain economic growth
and employment, and limit Shanxi's ability to export coal, industrial products, and
electricity. Since much of the existing industrial capacity will be idled without sufficient
water supplies by the year 2000, relaxing this constraint for industry alone generates
sufficient economic benefits to justify the project.
6.3    Water shortages also  inflict hardships on  municipal consumers, create
environmental damage as the groundwater is depleted, and hamper the ability of farmers
to meet agricultural demands. Municipal consumers suffer from periodic interruptions of
service and perpetually low water pressures. Many people living above the third floor are
continually without water. Groundwater has been overextracted by 15 percent or more
every year since 1990. This exploitation has led to rapidly falling water tables (reaching
145 m in some places), a growing cone of depression under Taiyuan City and increasing
incidences of land subsidence. The proposed project water would halt overextraction of
groundwater and permit a gradual natural replenishment of the aquifers. No attempt was
made to measure these environmental benefits. Between 1987 and 1993, farmers in the
Taiyuan project area saw their irrigation supplies decline from 207 million m3 to 68
million. In part, this was due to water tables dropping below their capacity to pump, but
mostly the water was transferred to industrial uses, either voluntarily through sales or
involuntarily. The Project would preserve farmers' rights to their local water supplies,
and provide them with increased supplies of treated waste and sewage water for use in
irrigating crops.
B. PROJECT BENEFITS
6.4   Water Demand Projections. The benefits from increased water supplies depend
in large part on the estimates of future water demand. Recent statistical evidence
suggests that the water demand projections presented in Chapter 2 may be too
conservative.2 Those projections assumed an urban population growth rate of 1.2 percent
2 Those projections were made by local Project staff and the Tianjin Design Institute.



- 55 -
between 1993 and 2000, whereas the growth in 1993-95 was nearly 3 percent per year.
They also projected the growth in industrial capacity at 8 percent to 2000, whereas recent
growth has been about twice that. The appraisal mission in 1996 produced a revised set
of water demand projections for household and municipal (H&M) demand, as well as
industrial demands, based on more recent trends, and careful forecasts worked out by the
Taiyuan Water Company. The revised projections include a breakdown into three cases:
"low" (which produces results similar to the earlier projections), "medium" (the most
likely case), and "high". In the medium case, urban population grows at 2.1 percent from
1995 to 2000, then slows to 1.4 percent. Industrial capacity grows at 10 percent from
1995 to 2000, then slows to 7.5 percent and 5 percent in the following decades. The
results of these new projections are summarized in Table 6.1.

6.5   Increased Human Consumption.3 Per capita urban consumption in Taiyuan was
91 liters/capita/day (l/c/d) in 1993 compared to the average for large Chinese cities of
210 l/c/d. A recent survey found that in half of households, per capita consumption was
less than 40 l/c/d. The project will permit urban consumption to reach China-wide norms
of 200 l/c/d by the year 2000. Water supplies will be available thereafter to parallel the
increase in population. It is estimated that urban consumption will increase by nearly 50
percent between 1993 and 2000.
6.6    Typically, willingness-to-pay (WTP) is used to measure the economic benefits to
increased urban consumption. WTP for urban water is observed to be about Y 1.8/m3 in
some coastal cities of China and is projected to be Y 4.3/mi3 in Taiyuan by 2002.
However, WTP is only valid for small increments in the water supply not for the large
changes that the proposed project will engender. Instead, a more conservative measure of
benefits, consumers' surplus (CS) is used. CS has been estimated from consumer
3 Includes consumption by commerce also.



- 56 -
demand functions to be Y 2.5/m3 for Taiyuan in 2000, rising to 4.5 in 2020. These
economic values are lower than the amortized cost of project water, but the increased
supplies generate unmeasured social benefits.
6.7    Benefits from Increased Industrial Consumption. Shanxi industries have made
heroic efforts to conserve water. Shanxi industries surpassed China-wide norms for the
year 2000 for recycling in 1991 and achieved an 84.3 percent recycling rate in 1993.
Production function analysis shows that most investment in Shanxi industries in recent
years went toward increasing the productivity of water. Yet water remains the overriding
constraint on industry. It is estimated that 1993 industrial output could have been Y 6.5
billion greater (22 percent) had there been no water shortage. Factories have been
observed to shut down periodically when water is not available.
6.8    Given an alleviation of the water shortage, Shanxi industrial capacity will
continue to grow based on the natural resource endowment and location of the province.
With additional water, annual industrial output is projected to increase by 75 percent
between 1993 and 2000. Without additional water, output is likely to stagnate near
current levels. Table 2.7 showed projected industrial output with and without the Project.
6.9   The benefits from the water delivered to mines and industries by the proposed
project are based on the increase in industrial economic value added4 due to the water
delivered. A simple calculation based on average value added per unit of water shows
that the return to water might be as high as Y 67/m3.  But the calculation is not
straightforward, since the benefits vary by industrial sector, by project area (because the
sectoral mix is different), by future year, and by degree of underutilized existing
industrial capacity. The calculations are further complicated by the fact that Shanxi
industries are highly interdependent: the power sector buys a great deal of coal, without
which additional water would have little impact on power production and hence
economic value added. By using a linear programming model derived from a Shanxi
input-output model, the measures of additional value added per unit of water shown in
Table 6.2 were obtained.
6.10   These values represent benefits applying to unutilized (because of water shortage)
industrial capacity beginning in 2000. After 2000, benefits will slowly decline to the
perceived long-run cost of water, which we assume to be about 5.8-the announced
future price of water to industries in Taiyuan. By 2029, all plant in existence in 2000 will
have been replaced with modern technology based on the 5.8 price, and benefits from
project water will have fallen to that level. It should be noted that this technology will be
far more conserving of water than that currently in operation, largely based on the
assumption of free water.
4 Economic value added is the sum of payments to factors of production (labor, capital, etc.) adjusted
where necessary for distortions due to taxes, subsidies, and/or price controls.

6.12    Benefits to Farmers.  Irrigated farming can be quite profitable near the large
cities if high-valued fruits and vegetables are grown. But average returns to irrigation are
quite low  at about Y 2/m3, which explains why farmers sometimes sell their water to
industry. The proposed project water will be far too expensive to use for irrigation
directly. Nevertheless, farmers in the project areas will stand to benefit indirectly. First,
their shares of both surface and groundwater will be preserved at current levels. Second,
the subsidence of water tables due to overextraction will cease. Currently, water tables



- 58 -
are dropping toward levels at which farm pumps may cease to operate. Over time, water
tables should again rise to stable depths, making it easier for farmers to access
groundwater. Third, there will be vastly greater supplies of treated sewage and industrial
waste water available for irrigation. The planned schedule of water treatment allows the
volumes shown in column 4 of Table 6.3 to become available to farmers in the project
area and those downstream in the Fen River Basin.
6.13   Economic benefits of irrigation water supplies are estimated to be Y 4.0/mi3 within
the Taiyuan Project Area and Y 1.2/mi3 downstream. The former area has higher returns
because the water transport distances are shorter (lower losses) and it has a higher
percentage of high-valued fruits and vegetables in its cropping pattern. The projected
supplies of irrigation water shown in Table 6.2 receive primary and secondary treatment,
or oxidation ponding. Priority will likely be given to farmers in the Taiyuan Project area,
up to the limit of their demands of 108 million m3/year. The remaining water will be
released to the Fen River for use by irrigators below Taiyuan. It has been verified that
downstream shortages in irrigation water are sufficiently large to absorb these volumes.
The use of the treated water in this manner will ultimately double the incomes of farm
families receiving it.
C. PRICES, TARIFFS, AND COST RECOVERY
6.14 The investment costs, including physical contingencies, and operation and
maintenance costs have been taken into account in estimating the economic costs of the
project. Economic O&M costs include electricity (valued at Y 0.35/kWh),5 management,
maintenance, overhaul and repair, and replacement costs of pumps and other equipment, all
expressed as economic values. Locally supplied components were evaluated at an exchange
rate of Y 8.3 to $1. Agricultural labor has been valued at Y 10 per day, the prevailing
market rate in the region. World Bank commodity price projections (1996) are used to
estimate farm-gate economic prices in constant 1995 terms for traded outputs and inputs.
6.15   The economic capital costs of water transfer from the project are Y 4.5/m3. The
financial costs are Y 4.86/m3. These levels, however, are far above present water tariffs
ranging from Y 1.0/mi3 for households to Y 1.2/m3 for industries.  As described in
Annex 7, the economic and social returns from Project water are sufficient to justify
tariffs that will result in full cost recovery. Accordingly, the Shanxi Province Price
Bureau has taken steps to increase water tariffs in Taiyuan in a stepwise fashion, so that
residential consumers will be paying Y 3.66/m3 by 2000, and industries, Y 5.78/m3,
averaging Y 4.94/mi3 (see Table 5.1). These levels have been justified through WTP
analysis (on the part of households) and financial profit analysis (for industries). They
will not only ensure full cost recovery, but provide incentives for more efficient water
use. Farmers who use treated wastewater from the project will be required to pay
Y 0.5/m3 to recover treatment and distribution costs.

D. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
6.16  Project investment (main works, water treatment and water supply networks for
Taiyuan City), incremental operation and management cost streams, and benefits streams
are presented in Annex 7. Based on the assumptions contained in these cost and benefit
streams and a 50-year project life, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the
project, excluding water treatment, is estimated to be 22.0 percent. The net present value
discounted at 12 percent (to 1995) is Y 10,316 million. Increased urban consumption
generates 7 percent of these benefits, and industrial consumption 85 percent and irrigation
10 percent. These returns exclude any difficult-to-measure environmental benefits from
the elimination of groundwater mining, and from the removal of health risks associated
with inadequate urban water supply.
E. ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS
6.17  The project would improve the economic potential and living conditions in the
most economically productive region of Shanxi Province.  This region is already
critically short of water for virtually all human development needs including (a) domestic
(b) industrial, and (c) agricultural needs. The project produced water will be used first for
residential purposes to meet consumer demands for drinking water, second for industries
to maintain and increase output and employment, and third for agriculture to maintain
and improve productivity. It is also planned to reduce the use of freshwater resources for
agriculture by substituting use of treated sewage effluents. In addition, the project-
produced water will reduce pressures on groundwater resources, already very serious and
causing serious economic/socioeconomic losses to all affected community sectors. The
reduction in groundwater use will also have important effects on small streams in
maintaining year-round flow and restoring the aquatic ecology. The project will also
make major strides to reduce pollution in the Fen River and thereby make more water
available for municipal purposes downstream.
6.18  The argument may be made that the project favors the socioeconomics of the
urbanized target areas, which are less poor than the rural areas. This is true, but it is these
target areas that are of prime importance to the macro economy and socioeconomic
standards of the entire province. The huge increase in industrial employment anticipated
with the project (Table 6.4) will obviously represent the main opportunity for masses of
farm youth to escape poverty. Also, where reservoirs are to be built as part of the project,
it is planned that the resettled rural farmers will be benefited, that is, their housing and
income levels will be improved as a result of the resettlement.
F. EMPLOYMENT AND INCOMES
6.19  Industries in the Taiyuan Project Area generated about 744,600 jobs in 1994, with
a total wage bill of Y 3,253 million. Table 6.4 shows the projected path of employment



- 60 -
and incomes with and without the project.6 In addition, farmers in the project area and
downstream will generate approximately Y 1,250 million of agricultural output from the
use of project wastewater, with associated gains of 35,000 person-years of employment
and Y 400 million of farm incomes.

G. PROJECT RISKS
6.20   The proposed project faces a variety of risks which could affect its performance.
These fall under the general headings: physical, finance, implementation and operational
risks, institutional/policy risks, environmental/long-term sustainability and economic.
Each type of risk is discussed in turn. Where possible, the economic cash flow model is
used to estimate the impact on the project's performance of a failure to avert the risk, and
the results summarized in Table 6.5 below.

6.21   The major physical risks involve construction mishaps and delays and seismic
events, which could destroy the tunnels and connecting works. Construction risks are
deemed to be within manageable limits given close supervision by foreign and Chinese
experts. Nevertheless, a 10 percent cost increase has been included in the base case cash
flow model. The probability of an earthquake of a sufficient magnitude (7.0 Richter
scale) to damage the works is estimated to be less than 0.01 percent over the construction
period. As shown in Table 6.5, a 50 percent increase in construction costs (after 1996)
would still yield a rate of return of 16.3 percent, and a two-year delay in obtaining any
benefits would still produce a 16.3 percent return.
6.22   An additional concern is that future flows in the Yellow River may be insufficient
to supply the Project's diversions. A simulation over the 56 years of available hydrologic
data showed that sufficient water will be available in all months and all years if upstream
diversions are held to currently agreed provincial allocation limits.
6.23   Financing risks arise from the finance scheme, which relies on general revenues
for only 10 percent of cofinancing, with the remainder from special taxation of water,
electricity and coal. The taxation scheme is already functioning and generating the
revenues projected for it, and there has been no reported resistance to it on the part of the
major coal and power producers. The impacts of a shortfall in any of the finance
components would be equivalent to a physical risk resulting in a one-year delay in project
benefits, and is deemed manageable.
6.24  Implementation and operational risks involve failures to deliver the needed
volumes of water in a timely fashion. To prepare for the complexities of implementing
and operating the project, YRDPB was established at an early stage, and staffed with
carefully selected local experts. The staff has been supplemented by foreign consultants
who will continue to assist and oversee the operation. A failure in implementation and
operation resulting in a one-year delay in achieving benefits would reduce the IRR from
22 percent to 18.8 percent. A continuing operational problem that would result in 20
percent lower water deliveries throughout the life of the project would reduce the IRR to
15.6 percent (Table 6.5).
6.25  Institutional/policy risks involve resistance to the proposed water tariff structure
or other factors that would result in low or uneven water fee collections. Such failures
would adversely affect the locally-financed component (see above).  If the water
authorities fail to charge the same price for all water of the same quality (project water
and existing ground and surface water), then the latter sources will continue to be
overexploited, and the demand for project water will be less than projected. This type of
risk is being addressed through strict water pricing covenants covering all water sources.
6.26   Environmental/sustainability risks would arise from a failure to adequately treat
and reuse incremental industrial waste and sewage water facilitated by the project. Such
a failure would result in environmental damage downstream of Taiyuan, and to the entire
lower reach of the Yellow River. Covenants to be negotiated would ensure that releases
to the Fen and Yellow rivers will be within safe levels according to Chinese



- 62 -
environmental standards. There is also a significant economic and income-distributional
benefit to treatment and reuse. Without this component the IRR would fall from 22.0
percent to 20.6 percent.
6.27  The major economic risks associated with the project are related to the projections
of industrial output and water demand by firms in the project areas. A lengthy economic
depression in China could cause the demand for Shanxi exports to fall and thereby reduce
the need for WWTP water. However, even under the "Low" assumptions about
economic growth (8 percent until 2000, then 5 percent), the rate of return is still above 18
percent. The "Low" growth rate is about half of Shanxi's recent experience.
6.28  Several other critical assumptions in the EIRR analysis were tested for sensitivity.
These tests are summarized in Table 6.5. In each case, the economic performance of the
project remains acceptable. The project would remain viable even if a combination of
unforeseen cost increases and delays should occur. If all post-1996 construction costs
should increase by 50 percent, operating costs increase by 50 percent, and all benefits
were delayed one year, the EIRR would still be 12.3 percent and the cost-benefit ratio
would be above 1.
H. PROJECT AFFORDABILITY
6.29  The proposed project water will be significantly more expensive than any water
source used in the project area to date. In 1993, industrial consumers paid an average of
Y l.1/m3 and urban residents, Y 0.7/mi3. Local authorities have already begun to increase
water prices, with the objective by the year of 2000 of Y 5.8/m3 for industrial users,
Y 3.66 for urban residents, and Y 0.6 to Y 1.5 for irrigators. The price structure was
designed to recover project costs as well as take into consideration the ability-to-pay of
consumers.
6.30  With the eventual prices in place, will the consumers be able to afford project
water? In the case of industrial users, the answer is unequivocally yes. Input-output
analysis has shown that marginal financial returns to all industries combined was about
3                                                            3
Y 20/mi in 1990, and rising rapidly. By 2000, it will be in the range of Y 50/mr.
6.31   Farm budget analysis has shown that the marginal returns to irrigation are in the
range of Y 1.1 to Y 5/m3 or more and have been rising recently as agricultural commodity
prices have increased. Even with the higher prices projected, irrigation charges will still
amount to only 6 percent of farm budgets in 2000 for grain production, and 20 percent for
vegetables.
6.32  Urban residents may be the most likely group to suffer from the increased water
charges since their costs are scheduled to increase fivefold over 1993 levels. However,
household budget information reveals that only 0.4 percent of household income went for
water in 1993, and this will rise to only 0.75 percent in 2000 with the higher water tariffs
and projected income increases. Under the unlikely possibility of no increase in urban
incomes, water would still comprise only about 2 percent of household budgets.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.1   During negotiations, assurances were obtained from:
(a)   the Borrower that it will prepare, by December 31, 1998, a satisfactory
maintenance program and an emergency preparedness plan for the dam.
Also, the Borrower will employ independent experts with qualifications,
experience and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank to inspect the dam,
associated works and structures regularly starting October 31, 1998,
according to sound engineering practices, to determine if any of the
structural conditions, maintenance or operating methods could endanger
safety. Inspections would be conducted annually for the first five years of
operations and every three years thereafter (para. 3.6);
(b)   the Borrower will (a) complete the resettlement for the Wanjiazhai Dam
according to a resettlement action plan that has been found acceptable to the
Bank; (b) employ by February 15, 1998 an independent monitoring
institution with qualifications, experience and terms of reference acceptable
to the Bank to evaluate semiannually the socioeconomic progress of those
resettled from the dam site; and (c) provide the Bank with a report of each
evaluation along with proposals for meeting the resettlement plan targets, if
they have not been achieved. (para. 3.7);
(c)   Shanxi Province that it will continue its program of dam maintenance for
Fen- 1 dam; also that the Province and independent experts with
qualifications, experience and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank
would, not later than February 15, 1998, inspect the dam-associated works
and structures, according to sound engineering practices. This would be
done to determine if any of the structures, maintenance or operating methods
are deficient and may compromise their safety. Shanxi will biannually
submit the experts' reports to the Bank, starting with the first report by
November 15, 1998 (para. 3.13);
(d)   Shanxi that it will establish through Taiyuan an SMO with terms of
reference, staffing and other resources acceptable to the Bank by
December 31, 1997 to appraise subprojects, provide subloans and

construction for the 12 months ahead (para. 3.42);
(f)    YRDPC  will employ  by  September 15, 1997  an  independent
environment/resettlement panel of experts to review and make
recommendations with respect to the EMP. Further, it shall maintain an
Environmental Management Office with competent staff in adequate
numbers and with responsibilities and functions acceptable to the Bank to
manage, coordinate and monitor the EMP. Also, it shall ensure that all
activities under the project will comply with the EMP (para. 3.49);
(g)   Shanxi that resettlement agencies at the provincial, county and township
levels will carry out the resettlement under the project according to the
RAP. YRDPC will (a) also carry out resettlement according to the RAP;
(b) employ an independent monitoring institution by September 15, 1997,
acceptable to the Bank, to evaluate the socioeconomic progress of those
affected by resettlement; (c) employ an independent panel of environment/
resettlement experts by September 15, 1997, satisfactory to the Bank, to
review the resettlement semiannually (see para. 3.49); (d) promptly furnish
to the Bank, for comment, reports of the findings and recommendations of
both groups; and (e) implement all recommendations for follow-up
actions, taking account of the Bank's comments (para. 3.57);
(h)   YRDPC would submit to the Bank by December 15 of each year the
financing plan and the proposed implementation program for the next year
as approved by the Government, and thereafter implement this program,
taking into account the Bank's views on it (para. 3.65);
(i)   Shanxi that it would onlend the proceeds of the Bank loan (other than for
the Institutional Support Program for Shanxi Government) to YRDPC,
under a subsidiary loan agreement with a 20-year term, including 5 years
of grace at the same interest rate and commitment fee as those paid by the
Borrower. The execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between Shanxi
and YRDPC, satisfactory to the Bank, would be a condition of
effectiveness of the loan (para. 3.66);
(j)    YRDPC shall, by April 30 of each year and for three years after
completion of the project, furnish to the Bank an annual monitoring report,
in a format acceptable to the Bank, covering all components of the project,
in conformance with the agreed monitoring indicators.  In addition,
YRDPC will provide semiannual progress reports by April 15 and October



- 65 -
15 of the project implementation in the previous semester including any
revisions to the project or its RAP or EMP (para. 3.76);
(k)   YRDPC and Shanxi (for the Institutional Components for Water Sector
Institutional Reform and Water Pollution Control and Industrial Waste
Management) that they would maintain separate accounts for the project and
that the audited project accounts of Shanxi and the audited financial
statements of YRDPC and Shanxi Government would be furnished to the
Bank within six months after the end of each fiscal year (para. 3.79);
(1)    YRDPC will maintain its project management office with competent staff
in adequate numbers and it will have responsibility and functions
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 4.3);
(m)   YRDPC will continue to employ an Engineer with qualifications,
experience and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank in order to
undertake the construction supervision (para. 4.5);
(n)   YRDPC that it will employ a POE by September 30, 1997 that is
independent from the project's designers; that the POE will conduct, at
least twice annually or more frequently as needed, reviews of designs and
technical specifications and advise on unforeseen problems relating to
project implementation, and that YRDPC will report the POE's findings to
the Bank and Borrower on a semiannual basis (para. 4.8);
(o)   YRDPC will prepare under guidelines acceptable to the Bank and furnish
to the Bank a program by June 30, 1999 for smooth transformation of
YRDPC from a construction entity to an operating entity and thereafter
will implement this plan, taking into account the Bank's comments on this
matter. The plan will have details of the new organizational structure,
staffing numbers and qualifications, and training programs for staff to
make the transition (para. 4.16);
(p)   Shanxi that each year incremental revenues from tariff adjustments and
increased water resources fees between 1997 and 2001 will be allocated to
YRDPC by December 31 of that year as a capital contribution to YRDPC
(para. 5.9);
(q)   Shanxi that it would prepare, on the basis of guidelines acceptable to the
Bank: (a) a program by February 15, 1998 to ensure that, by June 30,
2002, self-supplied groundwater would have the same tariffs as for all
other water supplied in Shanxi; and (b) a program by June 15, 1998 to
ensure that groundwater extraction would also be limited to safe yield
levels. Shanxi would thereafter implement these programs, taking into
account the Bank's comments on them(para. 5.18); and



- 66 -
(r)    YRDPC and Shanxi Province that financial performance indices for
YRDPC and TMWC's water supply operations will meet the following
requirements:
(i)    YRDPC would take all measures, including but not limited to tariff
adjustments, to ensure a debt service coverage ratio of no less than
1.2 throughout the whole debt repayment period (2003-16), and a
rate of return on two-year average notionally revalued net fixed
assets in service of no less than 2 percent for year 2011-16.
(ii)   Shanxi Province would cause TMWC to take all measures,
including but not limited to tariff adjustments, to ensure that (1)
debt/equity ratio is better than 70/30 between 1997 and 2001; (2) a
debt service coverage ratio of no less than 1.2 is achieved between
2002 and 2016 when YRDPC is paying off its subsidiary loan; and
(3) a rate of return on two-year notionally revalued net fixed assets
in service of no less than 2 percent is achieved for the same period
of 2002 and thereafter (para. 5.20).
7.2   Subject to the foregoing, the proposed project would be suitable for a US Dollar
single currency Bank loan of $400 million to the People's Republic of China. The loan
would be for a term of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years, at the Bank's
standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar denominated single currency loans.

D. CONTROLS AND AUTOMATION
It is understood that the major tasks of the control and automation systems are:
* Flow Control
* Economic Flow Dispatching
* Systemwide Normal Starting and Stopping
* Automation Operation Schemes and Coordination for Emergency Events
* Operation Monitoring
* Water Pricing
Control Levels
A three-level control and automation structure is a good approach for the project.
This concept is supported by the World Bank Team. The major functionality of the three
control levels is summarized as follows:
Level One (local or Pump Unit Level) Control
- Signal unit starting and stopping
* Automatic actions in case of a local emergency
3 Data collection and transmission to Level Two and Three
Level Two (Control/Pumping Station Level) Control
* Management of pump units: operating, maintenance, standby, if the control
station is local at pump station.
* Gate and valve control
* Display important information at local control centers
* Data collection and transmission to Level Three
* Logs and reports printing for local usage
* Allowing operators to perform some "remote control" functions.
Level Three (Diversion or Central Dispatching Level ) Control
* Management of the whole hydraulic network
* Remote control of key equipment
* Major emergency response schemes
* Global status information of all important equipment
* Operation planning and dispatching strategy
* Systemwide key information display
* Data treatment, storage, analysis and statistics
* Logs and reports printing for diversion usage

PART 2: COMPLEMENTARY WORKS: TAIYUAN CITY
1.    Taiyuan Municipality (area 7,000 kM2, population 2.6 millions in 1991) comprises
three urban districts (the City proper), two suburban districts, three counties and the Gujiao
City. Most of the population (about 1.8 million), is concentrated in Taiyuan City (170 km2)
and in the suburban districts. [These are also an estimated 300,000 "temporary" residents,
i.e., people without official residence permits living and working in the main urban areas.]
The area is heavily industrialized (coal mining, power generation, steel, heavy machinery
and chemicals). About 85 percent of industry is concentrated in Taiyuan City, about 10
percent is located in the northern outskirts and 4 percent in Gujiao. In 1993 there was about
23,600 ha of irrigated agriculture in the Municipal area. This annex reviews the current
situation for both water supply and wastewater in Taiyuan and goes on to identify the works
that will be required and are being planned to efficiently utilize the transferred water. The
concomitant institutional and operational improvements necessary and the associated
financing plans are also discussed.
A. WATER SUPPLY
2.    Water Agencies. The Municipality has in place a number of agencies responsible
for water supply, including:
(a)   the Taiyuan Municipal Water Company (TMWC), which provides water to
some 1.45 million people and industries in the main urban areas covering
about  O0 km;
(b)   the Municipal Water Resources Management Commission, which provides
water to the suburban districts and the counties, as well as the power and
steel industries, and for agriculture;
(c)   the Gujiao Water Supply Company; and
(d)   industries that operate their own sources (around 558 wells) serving both
industrial and domestic needs.
The Tianjin Investigation and Design Institute (TIDI), consultants to The Yellow River
Development Project (YRDP), has carried out comprehensive studies of the water resources
available to the Municipality as a whole, and has prepared water demand forecasts. The
Southwest Municipal Engineering Design and Research Institute of China (SMEDRIC) has
prepared prefeasibility studies for the water supply works required to utilize project water,
and has also prepared forecasts of demand and resources available for the city area.
3.    Present Water Resources. Both surface water and groundwater are used within
the Municipality, although the latter dominates (over 80 percent) for municipal/domestic
and industrial uses. Groundwater abstractions are estimated by the Municipal Water
Resources Commission to be 960,000 m3/day (350 million m3/year) compared to a safe
yield (estimated by TIDI) of 840,000 m3/day (307 million m3/year).  Most of the



- 75 -                     ANNEX I
overabstraction is in the urban area, where current (1994) abstraction rates are about
650,000 m3/day, compared with an estimated safe yield of around 410,000 m3/day
(SMEDRIC). Groundwater levels have declined by some 2 to 3 m per year, natural springs
and wells have dried up and local ground subsidence has occurred, in some areas of the city.
Coal mining activities compound these problems. Abstraction depths are over 200 m in the
south of the city, but less to the north (around 120 m). Unless alternate sources of water are
developed, the City will face a declining level of urban and industrial activity, under use of
land, energy and mineral resources, increase in environmental pollution and lower living
standards.
4.    Groundwater abstraction is regulated through a renewable (five years) permit
system, instituted in 1993. All requests for new wells are subject to review and approval by
the Municipal Water Resources Commission. Wells are metered and allocated abstraction
quotas by the Water Saving Office of the Urban Construction Commission (UCC). Heavy
fines are imposed for overabstraction.  However, basic abstraction charges are low
(Y 0.11 /m3 for industry and Y 0.10 for domestic users). TMWC is exempt from these
charges. Per capita supply for domestic/municipal uses in 1993 was around 120 liters/day,
of which residential use was 70 liters/day, as estimated by TMWC. These are among the
lowest in the nation. In some areas, residential use is even less, due to local supply
constraints. Estimated uses and sources of water in the Municipality and in the TMWC
service area in 1993 are summarized in Table I below.

5.    TMWC serves the main urban and industrial area and operates nine water
distribution/treatment plants and five booster pump stations. TMWC sources are dominated
by three major well fields: Lan Cun (300,000 m3/day); Xi Zhang (70,000 m3/day); and
Zaogou (70,000 m3/day). TMWC has other, minor, active sources totaling 23,000 m3/day.
Total supply by the water company in 1993 averaged around 415,000 m3/day (151 million
m 3/year), with annual sales of 140 million m 3/year, of which an estimated 53 million m3
were domestic/municipal, 10 million m3 institutional and 77 million m3 industrial/
commercial. Supply in 1994 increased to 420,000 m3/day. About 240 factories have their
own supply systems, abstracting groundwater (serving both industrial and domestic uses)
from around 558 wells. In 1993, abstractions totaled 270,000 m3/day (98 million m3/year),
rising to 290,000 m3/day in 1994. The Water Savings Office estimates that 40 percent of
water abstracted by factories is used for domestic purposes for workers living on the factory
site. Industry is reported to reuse about 30,000 m /day (11 million m3/year) after treatment,
and the power and steel industries use about 90,000 m3/day (33 million m3/year) of surface
water abstracted from the East and West irrigation canals, which pass through the city.
6.    Water Treatment Facilities, Distribution System and Supply Zones. Water
abstracted from the wells is generally of good quality. Treatment of groundwater comprises
chlorination conforming with national standards. Water quality is tested both by TMWC
and by the Public Health Bureau. Treatment for industrial self-supplies presumably reflect
end use (i.e., disinfected for domestic use; untreated for basic industrial uses). Surface
waters abstracted by the power station and steel mill are used, after settlement, as cooling
and wash water.
7.    TMWC serves three principal service areas in the City:  west, northeast and
southeast. Each of these areas have a number of subzones controlled by five booster pump
stations and seven forwarding stations at which additional disinfection is applied. The
system is designed to be pressurized by pumps, with no water towers or reservoirs. Some
enterprises have constructed their own storage facilities and many apartment blocks have
roof tanks. The shortage of water in some areas is attributable both to inadequate supply
and to deficiencies in the network. The western service area is fed from the Xi Zhang
wellfield, whereas the east bank is fed from both the Lan Cun and Zaogou wellfields.
Trunk mains from Xizhang are 700 and 900 mm dia. and from Lan Cun twin 1,000 mm dia.
pipes supplying the power station and steel mill, and an 1,100 mm dia. pipe supplying the
central city area; 600 and 700 mm dia. pipes from Zaogou connect to the Lan Cun trunk
mains. The Lan Cun source has the highest quality and is also the cheapest to operate
(lowest pumping head). It is thus generally used to provide the base load.
8.    Trunk mains are generally concrete or steel with cast iron secondary mains, now
between 10 and 30 years old. Tertiary distribution and house connections are generally
galvanized iron. Leakage, which forms almost all unaccounted-for water (UfW), is reported
to be only 6 to 7 percent, based on readings taken at "bulk" meters (there are 3,000 such
meters in the whole city and TMWC charging is based on readings at these). This does not
take account of downstream distribution losses and also reflects the low pressures within the
system. Losses per unit length of trunk main are estimated to be 44 m /km/day. The total



- 77 -                      ANNEX I
UfW is estimated at 30 percent presently. The UfW is expected to be kept lower (about 20
percent) because of complete rehabilitation of the distribution system before 2001 (see
Table 4). In addition, it is planned to have a UfW study to identify the main sources of
UfW. Distribution is controlled by manual adjustment of valves and pumps. Information
on pressures at 20 monitoring points in the network is telemetered to the head office, from
where decisions on the dispatch of water are made. In view of the water shortage, parts of
the network are shut down in turn, to ensure that water is available to all areas in rotation.
Large enterprises, such as the Steel Mill and Chemical Works, have their own distribution
systems.
9.    Resource and System Management and Water Charges. There is an underlying
problem of a lack of overall coordinated resource management; the inability of TMWC to
deliver adequate supplies has led, in the urban area, to what is effectively a "free for all,"
with industrial, domestic and agricultural users competing for a dwindling supply of
groundwater. While the Municipal Water Resources Commission is attempting to control
the situation through the abstraction permit system, a more rational approach to the
conjunctive management of surface and groundwater is being developed. In particular,
further regulatory measures will need to be taken to curb and rationally allocate individual
groundwater abstractions, as this source will be cheaper than project water. As pressures in
the system are increased, water wastage and system losses could become significant. A
comprehensive water conservation, leak detection and prevention program is required.
Business and domestic users are metered as bulk supplies, with residents in an apartment
block, for example, being required to organize their own sharing of water charges. There
are around 330,000 domestic meters. As noted earlier, a groundwater abstraction charge is
collected from enterprises with their own wells. TMWC charges for treated water (1995)
are Y 1.1/m3 for business users and Y 0.7/m3 for domestic/municipal users and for
government institutions.
10.   Economic Growth and Water Demand Forecasts. Forecasts are prepared by the
Municipal Government and indicate significant growth in a number of areas. Principal
features are summarized in Table 2. Forecasts of water demand have been made both by
TIDI for the Municipality as a whole, and by SMEDRIC for the TMWC service area.
These forecasts are difficult to compare, as they are not based on the same assumptions.
Furthermore, while TIDI has focused on industrial and agricultural forecasts, with limited
attention to domestic/municipal demands, SMEDRIC has focused on domestic/municipal
demands with industrial demand forecasts being relatively crude and agricultural/rural
demands omitted. Clearly, the forecasts are intended for different purposes; TIDI's is
intended to provide an overall view of the projected municipal water balance, whereas
SMEDRIC's is intended as a guide to capacity requirements within TMWC's service area.
As the project water will be transferred to TMWC, the SMEDRIC forecasts have been
adopted for the planning of the treatment and distribution works. Detailed forecasts were
also prepared based on economic growth parameters and taking account of price elasticity
effects (see Annex 7).



- 78 -                     ANNEX 1
11.   Water Distribution System. The SMEDRIC report compares the options of a
single water treatment plant at Huyan for all of the transferred water against one plant at
Huyan and a second nearer the city center, each treating part of the flow. The conclusion
reached is that a single plant at Huyan is the most cost-effective solution. The major part
of the city can be supplied by gravity from this location, although fringe areas require
pumping stations to boost supplies. The report reviews the use of three booster pump
stations compared to two, and concludes that two will provide the most economic
solution. Pipeline sizing has been optimized using a network analysis program provided
by Tongji University. Storage of 10 percent of daily capacity will be provided for
regulation purposes. A separate low quality supply of 56,000 m3/day for power station
No. 2 is provided by omitting some of the processes for part of the flow. The possibility
of supplying other industrial areas with low quality water has also been examined, both
for a complete dual distribution system for the whole city and also for a partial system for
the principal industrialized areas. The conclusion reached is that dual supplies, whether in
general or to targeted industrial areas, would add significantly to costs due to the
additional pipework required.

12.    It has been agreed that TMWC will be responsible for the treatment and distribution
of the whole of the project water resource delivered to Taiyuan and has signed a
memorandum of understanding with YRDPO to this effect. The new treatment works at
Huyan and associated distribution networks will present a new challenge for TMWC, both
in view of its size and the modem treatment technologies required. It will therefore be
important to ensure that technical assistance and training are provided, both for
management and systems design and O&M. The conjunctive management of the existing
and future resources and system design will depend on the locations of major centers of
demand (particularly large industry), and the policy regarding the use of groundwater.
Groundwater abstractions in the urban area are predicted to reduce from around 650,000
m3/day in 1994 to 410,000 mr3/day in 2020. A rational approach to groundwater allocations
could result in significant cost savings, in terms of treatment capacity and pipework
required. A operational analysis using a dynamic computer network model is to be carried
out to assist in planning, design and specification of new works. SMEDRIC future resource
and demand forecasts are summarized in Table 3 below. The investigation of the upstream
connecting works by Shanxi Investigation and Design Institute for Water Resources (SIDI)
suggests an appropriate interim step in transfers. The timing of utilization of project
transfers can be reviewed, as demand develops, and it may be possible to surcharge the
treatment works should deficits develop in interim years while additional capacity is being
developed.

13.   Project Water Delivery aind Treatment. Water from the project tunnel will be
delivered at the new TMWC water treatment plant at Huyan at the north end of the City.
The Huyan treatment works will have an initial capacity of 1.0 million m3/day and an
ultimate capacity of 1.87 million m3/day. The treatment processes will take into account the
raw water quality-a varying mix of Yellow River water and local runoff, with high
turbidity and suspended solids, especially during the flood season. The SMEDRIC studies
recommend the following process: Presedimentation using open radial flow clarifiers with
provision for the addition of polymer coagulating agents; rapid mechanical mixing tanks for
coagulant dosing and pH adjustment; mechanical flocculators; rectangular, baffled
settlement tanks; conventional rapid gravity sand filters with air/water backwashing;
disinfection tanks for liquid chlorine and ammonia dosing; and treated water storage of 15
percent of the daily flow. TMWC are proposing to build the presedimentation tanks at the
Fen-1 reservoir site. These would only be operated during the flood season. Given that
the Fen-1 reservoir acts as a silt trap, the need for these tanks remains to be established,
following  further study  and  water quality  analysis.   The  requirements  for
presedimentation will be reviewed during the detailed design phase. Sludge generated by
the treatment processes is to be discharged to river under the current Phase 1 feasibility
design, with proper treatment facilities being provided in Phase 2. This decision will be
reviewed during the detailed design phase, in view of concerns over the environmental
acceptability of this proposal. A facility for the tapping of partially treated water for the
power station will be included in the works and would optimize treatment and distribution
costs. Computerized monitoring and control systems will be included for all the processes.
The coagulation, settlement and filtration processes will be enclosed, in view of the severe
winter temperatures: heating will also be necessary.   The SMEDRIC  design
recommendations will form the basis of the final designs now under preparation in
collaboration with Japanese OECF financing.

- 81-                          ANNEX I
added or will replace existing systems (see Table 4 above). These will be cast iron
(400 mm and less), "improved" cast iron (up to 1,600 mm) or steel (for larger diameters).
Tertiary systems will also need to be expanded and renewed where appropriate. However,
final designs and programs will be based on dynamic network modeling to optimize
operations and take into account the revised Town Plan. A leakage detection and control
program  for which Terms of Reference will be agreed during the appraisal will be
implemented and will assist in detailed network planning, pipeline replacement and
conservation of water. A more strategic approach to system improvement, over a longer
time span, targeting specific supply zones and making best use of the capacity of the
existing systems may be appropriate. Network modeling will aid strategic planning and
programming and serve to optimize the design, assess operational characteristics, optimize
performance and examine the effects of conjunctive use of the project water and
groundwater supplies. Consideration also could be given to the provision of additional
storage over the 10 percent of daily supply now proposed, as a means of flow balancing,
and reducing pipe size requirements.

15.    Program, Financial Requirements and Proposals.  TMWC intends to utilize
project water as it becomes available from 2001 and preliminary cost estimates have been
made. Works that are planned to be completed by TMWC for Phase 1 and their costs,
including 8 percent physical contingencies (as estimated by SMEDRIC), are summarized in
Table 5. TMWC propose to finance these investments through a combination of national
funds and international loans (60 percent). TMWC is negotiating with Japanese financing
agencies (OECF) to secure finance for the Huyan treatment works. Local financing will be
raised from the Municipal Planning Commission, the Municipal Construction Commission,
the Provincial Government and from additional connection and supply charges, water



- 82 -                      ANNEX 1
resource fees and surcharges on current water consumption. The Japanese finance will be
provided through their OECF private sector facility, in a similar manner to that provided
for the Changchun Industrial Water Supply Project. Onlending will be through the Bank
of China. Under this arrangement, a joint venture (J/V) will be established between
private sector Japanese and Chinese companies to design, build and operate the works.
TMWC, along with 32 local investors from the state-owned and private business
community in Taiyuan, will form the Chinese company, which has applied for its
business license. Most of the mechanical and electrical components for the treatment
works and pumping stations will be procured from Japan. The Japanese Company will
not invest directly in the project, but will contribute to the design and construction of the
works, provide technical assistance with operation and maintenance for three years after
completion of construction, and then withdraw. The J/V will thus operate the plant for
three years, and then hand over to the Chinese partner to continue.  Water sales
agreements between the three parties (YRDPC, the J/V and TMWC) will be drawn up at
the same time as the financing and concession agreements.

16.   The Existing Water Environment. The Fen River deteriorates significantly in
quality as it passes through Taiyuan City. There are significant levels of pollution in the
river and its tributaries as a result of the numerous discharges of untreated and partially
treated domestic sewage and industrial wastes. This situation will only be improved with
the extension and upgrading of sewerage systems, and the expansion of treatment facilities
for domestic and industrial discharges. Wastewater discharges were estimated in 1993 to be
around 220 million m3, of which around half was of industrial origin. Most of this
wastewater is discharged to the Fen River, either through sewers or open ditches and
tributaries. Seventeen major enterprises contribute over 80 percent of the industrial volume,
the largest being the steel mill, the fertilizer plant, the two power stations, the chemicals
plant and the paper mill. Water quality measurements taken at seven sampling sites on the
Fen River in May 1993 (a typical low-flow situation), indicated that levels of chemical
oxygen demand (COD), phenol, ammonia, nitrates, chromium and cyanide were well above
acceptable standards. Samples taken in tributaries of the Fen River in April 1993 showed
similar problems.
17.   Drainage Areas. There are currently eight defined drainage areas in Taiyuan, as
described below. Most have separate stormwater and sanitary sewers, but the older,
downtown area has a combined system. The drainage areas are: (a) Shang Lan, a small
area (2.5 km ) to the north of the main city mainly serving the paper mill; (b) Bei Jiao in the
northeast of the city (23 km 2), which serves the Jing Yang and Xin Yang chemical works;
(c) the steel mill industrial and housing area (26 kmi2) in the northeast of the city; (d) the
main downtown area (34 kmi2) on the east bank; (e) Nan Jiao, the largely industrial area
(23 km2) in the southeast of the city; (f) He Xi North, the west bank of the city, northern
area (21 km2); (g) He Xi Central, the west bank of the city, central area (10 km2); and
(h) Nan Yan, the area (20 km2) in the southwest of the city, mainly serving the Taiyuan
Chemical Company's factories and the No. 2 Power Plant.

18.   Treatment Works. There are three municipal sewage treatment works (STWs), all
on the east side of the river: Bei Jiao in the north, Yang Jia Bao serving the central down
town area, and Ying Jia Bao in the south. In addition, there are two works serving
industrial plants and their cnvirons: Zhao Zhuang, serving Taiyuan Iron and Steel
Company on the east side of the river, and Nan Yan serving the chemical complex on the
west side. Key data are summarized in Table 6.

Note: AAA means anaerobic-anoxic-aerobic. AS means activated sludge. DAF means
dissolved air flotation. All flows and capacities in m3/day.
19.   Management and Financing of Operations. There are a number of fees for
sewerage services collected by the Water Saving Office on behalf of the Municipal
Government:  Y 0.1 0/mn3 from government institutions; Y 0.12/mi3 from industry and
commerce; and no charge for domestic connections. In addition, where an effluent from an
enterprise does not reach the standards laid down for discharge to sewer, a fine is collected
by the Monitoring Station of the Urban Engineering Management Bureau, depending on the
nature of the effluent and the damage caused. These fees are supplemented by revenue
from the sale of treated sewage effluent for reuse within industry, for which the rate was
Y 0.4/mi3 in 1995. A volume charge of Y 0.05/mi3 is also collected by the Environmental
Protection Bureau (EPB) from industrial users. EPB also imposes fines for discharges to
the environment that do not comply with the standards set. The reported operating costs for
sewage collection and treatment vary from Y 0.1 6/mn3 for a simple pumping station
discharging sewage to the river without treatment, to Y 0.22/m3 for treatment at Yang Jia
Bao and Y 0.74/m3 for treatment at Bei Jiao. Total income does not cover the costs of
providing the service, which is subsidized by the Municipal Government through an annual
budget provision, with all revenues collected being returned to Government. The budget for
1994 for operation of treatment works was around Y 9.4 million, whereas that for
maintenance of the sewerage network was Y 0.9 million.

20.   The operation and maintenance of STWs is carried out by the Drainage
Management Section of the Urban Management Bureau, while the maintenance of sewers is
the responsibility of the Municipal Engineering Management Section of the Bureau, which
also has responsibility for roads, bridges, streetlights, etc. The latter organization has area-
based management units, with separate roads and sewers gangs in each. All STWs and
most sewers are designed by the Taiyuan Municipal Engineering Design Institute (TMEDI).
However, this institute only takes schemes to the detailed engineering stage: completion of
tender documents and all subsequent stages of implementation are dealt with by an
investment institute under the Planning Commission. Public lavatories and the disposal of
nightsoil are managed by the Sanitation Bureau, and the Environmental Protection Bureau
is responsible for monitoring discharges to the environment and for collecting volume fees,
pollution fees and fines. It is apparent that the organizational framework for planning,
operations, investment, fee collection and financing of sewerage services is fragmented.
Ideally, the provision of sewerage services should be integrated within a single entity,
which would have full responsibility for planning, design and financing of systems and for
the collection, treatment and disposal of sewage and industrial wastes, nightsoil and sewage
sludge. The formation of such an entity could be considered as a precursor to the formation
of a Sewerage Company, which would become financially autonomous through the
collection of user charges for wastewater collection, treatment and disposal. Control of
discharges to the environment should be effected through a discharge permit system,
which would set limits for industrial and municipal discharges and ensure these are met
through enforcement proceedings. The EPB has currently issued permits for 36 major
factories accounting for 85 percent of wastewater discharged, and has plans to expand the
system to over 100 factories. At present the permitting system does not encompass
municipal treatment plants.
21.   Plans for Expansion. An outline plan for the improvement of existing sewerage
facilities has been drawn up by TMEDI, taking into account the anticipated increases in
flows due to the project. The planning horizon assumed is 2010. The planning increases
the number of drainage areas from 8 to 15, as detailed in Tables 7 and 8, and takes account
of the new city plan. Investment needs are summarized in Table 9. It is planned to have
adequate treatment facilities for about 60 percent (700,000 m3/day) of the estimated wastes
by the year 2002 and for about 75 percent (1,170,000 m3/day) by 2010. Although the
improvements necessary to overcome existing deficiencies and to accommodate the
additional loads to be generated by the project have been identified in very broad terms,
only limited study/design work has been undertaken on these improvements and funding
has not been secured.
22.   Outline designs have been prepared for the provision of sludge digestion facilities at
Yang Jia Bao and for the He Xi Central and North treatment plant (which replace earlier
proposals for two plants). These are seen to be the priorities. In both cases, the designs
relate to the preproject capacity scenario, and will need to be revised. The Institute is also
preparing construction drawings for a proposed plant at Xi Shan on behalf of the Coal
Mining Bureau for construction later this year

23.   Financing. The current rate of expenditure on sewerage is Y 30 million per year,
compared to the need for Y 3.2 billion over the next 20 years, if the plan is to be
implemented (about Y 150 million per year). The new Provincial Governor has indicated
that expenditure on sewerage should be stepped up by Y 10 million per year, each year, but
this will still not be adequate to achieve the program indicated. The Municipality has
considered foreign finance, and a deputation went abroad to seek an environmental
protection loan last year, as it was recognized that there would not be an economic rate of
return on the investment. However, a major share of long-term financing and operational
costs could be borne by wastewater generators on the "generator pays" principle. The
proposed financing plan is summarized in Table 10, although it is envisaged that this will be
reviewed under the Environmental Waste Plan.

24.   Wastewater Management Master Plan. The Municipal STWs serving Taiyuan
are well constructed and maintained although the day-to-day management of the plants
could be improved to optimize their perforrnance. The extent of the sewerage systems is
such that large volumes of domestic and industrial sewage are discharged directly to
watercourses resulting in high levels of pollution and risk to public health. The revenue for
the services supplied is inadequate to cover the costs of the existing service, resulting in
substandard performance. Outline plans for the improvement of these services have been
identified and some design work undertaken on specific items. The Urban Master Plan for
Taiyuan area has been updated to include priority sewerage and industrial wastes collection
and treatment requirements in the near term. The Taiyuan Municipality and the proposed
TWMC will also prepare a Wastewater Management Master Plan (WMMP). Terrns of
Reference for the WMMP have been prepared and will be agreed with the Shanxi
Government during negotiations.

ANNEX 5: ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
SUMMARY
A. INTRODUCTION
Project Concept
1.    The EIA report for the project was based on the utilization and updating of earlier
studies of the project, which will meet the requirements of MWR, NEPA, Shanxi
Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB), and the World Bank.
2.    The EIA methodology utilized was that described in NEPA's EIA Guidelines
Modules now routinely used by NEPA and many provincial EPBs. This methodology
classifies environmental resources into four categories: (a) natural physical resources,
(b) natural biological resources, (c) human development resources, and (d) quality-of-life
resources. This identifies and evaluates the significant environmental issues (SEIs), i.e.,
potentials for adverse effects posed by the project components, and arranges for
modifications in the project planning so the net overall environmental impact will be
acceptable. In addition, an overall Environmental Management Plan (EMP) is prepared,
to be implemented when the project proceeds, and an Environmental Management Office
(EMO) is established, within the overall Project Management Structure, with
responsibility for implementing the EMP.
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
3.    Detailed project description is in Chapter 3 and Annex 1 of the SAR. The
description of the environmental components is summarized below.
Environmental Protection Components
4.    Generally, each of the various components of the project has been designed to
incorporate environmental protection measures as specified in the project EIA.  In
addition to the project's physical components, the overall present project includes (a) an
environmental training program, (b) an environmental monitoring program, for both
construction and operation stages, (c) a public participation program, and (d) an
Environmental Management Plan with an Environmental Management Office for
implementing the Environmental Management Plan.
Project Alternatives
5.    The decision to import water to Taiyuan from Wanjiazhai reservoir is based on
extensive studies that show that this is the only feasible solution. No more water, either



-111-                       ANNEX5
surface or groundwater, is available locally, hence import of water is essential, and import
from Wanjiazhai represents by far the lowest cost system.
6.    With current water shortages in the Project Areas amounting to 40 percent of
estimated demand, and growing rapidly, and both groundwater and surface water supplies
declining, failure to complete the project would engender economic, social, and
envirornmental calamity. Projections using the Provincial Planning Model (PPM) show
that if the project area urban residents are to be given supplies equaling the norms for
China, and if farmers water allocations are to be preserved at current levels, industrial and
mining activities would decline rapidly and virtually cease after the year 2010. It is not
surprising that Chinese planners have mentioned the possibility that the Taiyuan/Datong
industries would need to be relocated (at incalculable cost) if project water is not
forthcoming.
C. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Environmental Study Area (ESA)
7.    The EIA Main Report (not included here) includes drawings that show the EIAs
for each of the Phase I EIA component studies, namely Wanjiazhai Reservoir, GMT,
SMT, Fen- l Reservoir, Connection Works, and the Taiyuan Service Area.
Land Use
8.    The overall project ESA is primarily hilly and mountainous and the land use in
the area can be broadly categorized into farmland, garden plot, forest, grassland, urban
and industrial area, infrastructure, water area, and wasteland area. Land use in the ESA
has long been impacted by human activities, primarily agriculture, and the impact has
been particularly severe on the area's forest and wildlife resources. The land use impact
of the project per se will be essentially limited to the vicinity of the projects ground-
surface components.
Natural Physical Resources
9.    The project region enjoys temperate/seasonal/continental zone type of climate, is
drought prone, and the annual precipitation ranges between 430 and 480 mm.
10.   The project passes through several major tectonic features, including two seismic
zones. The Pianguan river, a tributary of the Yellow River, constitutes the major surface
hydrology for the GMT, and the Pianguan, Jian-er, and Fen rivers for the SMT.
Groundwater along the project is of good quality and suitable for community use
purposes.



-112 -                       ANNEX5
Natural Biological Resources
11.   The natural biological resources in Phase I/ESA  may be categorized into
(a) forests and other vegetation, (b) terrestrial wildlife, and (c) aquatic ecology (see Table
8).
12.   With respect to animal wildlife in the ESA, because of low vegetation coverage
the animal habitats are limited. A total of 133 animal species are found, including 31
species of resource animals and some 16 species of State-protected animals including 4 in
the Class I rare category. However, all of the project component facilities (excluding
tunnels) are located in already humanized developed areas. All of the protected species
live in areas remote from the project components locations/activities; hence, they should
not be affected by the project.
13.   With respect to aquatic species, the ESA waterways contain relatively few aquatic
plants and aquatic animals. There are some 17 species of fish but these have no
commercial value and all are hardly of value even for subsistence. There are no known
rare aquatic species that would be affected. The Fen River is heavily affected by
Taiyuan, by extractions and pollution discharges, and has no significant remaining
aquatic species of value.
Development Resources
14.   The area along the GMT lines is primarily an agricultural region with limited
farming and livestock because of limited water and mountainous terrain. Crops like
millet, beans, corn, oats, potato, sesame, broomcorn millet, and fruits like apple, pears
and grapes are grown. Livestock development is mainly sheep raising. Agricultural
production is also low in the SMT area because of poor landform and unfavorable
climatic conditions, although it still is the main source of income for local people.
15.   With respect to urbanization/industrialization, most of the project area is hilly and
mountainous resulting in limited urban industrial development in the region.
Quality of Life Resources
16.   Shanxi Province, including the project ESA, represents one of the poorest regions
in China, despite the presence of considerable mineral resources including the coal
mining and power industries. The people in the ESA, in their reliance on economic
income sources, are in roughly two categories: (a) those in urban centers who are
working mainly in industry, and (b) rural villagers who depend mainly on agriculture.
The latter are much poorer than the former. By far the most important parameter, which
is crippling the continuing development of the province, is lack of water supply for all
sectors of development. This includes both the urban/industrial sector, which represents
the backbone of the overall economic/socioeconomic resources of the province, and the
rural farning sector where the people are very poor despite availability of adequate farm
land areas.

17.   There are no precious archeological relics or monuments of historical or special
culture located in any of the project component areas.
D. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND EPMs
Delineation of Significant Environmental Issues (SEIs)
18.   The essential findings of the EIA process, namely (a) delineation of the SEIs,
(b) evaluation of each of these to make a quantified assessment of the potentials for
adverse environmental effects if no Environmental Protection Measures (EPMs) are
utilized, and (c) delineation and quantification of the needed EPMs so that the project will
be economically sound. Needs for environmental monitoring during the construction and
operation stages are concerned with the water transfer system, which will deliver the
imported water to Taiyuan City (to the Huyan Water Treatment Plant), and focuses on
use of the imported water by the City.
19.   The SEIs identified and evaluated by the project EIA are listed as follows (see
Table 1):
(a)   Critical need for additional water for Taiyuan service area;
(b)   Availability of water for diversion to Taiyuan;
(c)   Delivery system:
(i)    Resettlement
(ii)    Assurance of continuing delivery of imported water
(iii)    Maintenance of water quality
(iv)    Construction operations constraints
(v)    Disposal of tunnel excavation materials
(vi)    Siltation problems;
(d)   Use of imported water at Taiyuan:
(i)    Appropriate use of both imported water and local water resource
including reuse
(ii)    Water management and pollution control/water quality in Fen
River
(iii)    Coordination of (i) and (ii) for optimal overall water use and
pollution control system;

(e)   Overall
(i)    Environmental monitoring during construction and operation
stages
(ii)    Environmental Management Plan and Office
(iii)    Environmental/Training.
Evaluation of SEIs
Land Use
20.   The significant impacts of the project on land use for Phase I will be in
(a) acquisition of land for the transmission line facilities that are aboveground, including
construction camps, and (b) land needed for disposal of tunnel excavation materials. This
totals some 659 ha, of which 166 ha will be used only temporarily. About 579 ha of the
required land is farmland. However, the reduction of farmland, both permanent and
temporary, should not have any significant impacts on farming in the region traversed by
the Phase I project because this only represents less than 0.1 of 1 percent of the farmland in
the region.
Hydrology
21.   Environmental Concerns. The environmental concerns on project hydrology
relates to the effects caused by the water transmission system along its route, and on
beneficial uses of both surface water and groundwater resources, both during the
construction and operation stages.  The effects due to the construction stage are
temporary, whereas those during the operation stage are continuing.
22.   Surface Water. The planned project, when completed, will divert annually from
Wanjiazhai Reservoir 640 million m3 water to Taiyuan Service Area and 560 million m3
to the Pingshuo and Datong Service Areas when these are connected. However, for
Phase 1, limited to SMT, only 640 million m3 will be diverted. No reservoirs are included
in Phase I, but Phase I will utilize the existing Fen-1 reservoir for regulation purposes.
The diverted water will have significant positive impacts on the surface water hydrology
in the three service areas. Assuming the recommended EPMs are properly followed and
implemented during both construction and operation stages, the project is expected to
have no significant negative impacts on hydrology in the Project ESA. Use of Fen-I
reservoir for regulating purposes will not adversely affect the existing function of this
reservoir.
23.   Flooding and Siltation Hazards. Flooding hazards are very unlikely to be
caused by tunnel failures because the tunnels are deeply in the ground. But flood hazards
may be caused by pipe, aqueduct, or culvert failures due to earthquakes, poor operations,
and poor construction quality. When such failure occurs, the monitoring and control



-115 -                      ANNEX5
system to be established along the project will function to stop the diversion immediately,
so the water released out the pipe or aqueducts is limited to only the water volume in the
transmission line between two nearest valves (gates), which are designed to be promptly
closed.
24.   The only existing stream to which the diverted water will be discharged is the Fen
River on SMT. While the imported water volume will be about the same as the average
river flow, the imported volume will represent less than 1 percent of the Fen River flood
flow peaks. Hence, the effect of the imported water on Fen River hydrology is expected
to be negligible. With respect to the impact of the silt content of the imported water on
Fen River siltation, the volume of imported silt is only about 3 percent of that in the river
from local runoff; hence, the effect of the imported water will be to alleviate existing
siltation problems.
25.   Groundwater. All of the tunnels on the GMT and SMT are located above
groundwater, so no groundwater problems are expected, in either construction or
operations. Because there are no villages along the tunnel routes, and limited farmland,
the tunnel operations are not expected to exert any negative impact on groundwater use
by villagers along these routes.
26.   Water for construction will be obtained from wells built by the Construction
Contractors. The wells to be utilized must be stated and identified by each Construction
Contractors (CC) at the time of his proposal, and the CC must arrange to obtain the water
he needs without impairment of existing beneficial water users and/or with the
concurrence of the existing users.
27.   The construction well will lower the groundwater table to some extent during the
construction period. However, the impacts should not be significant because the wells
are located far from existing wells, will extract from areas not conflicting with existing
wells, and the amounts withdrawn for each well is small (less than 1,000 m3/day).
28.   Monitoring Program for Hydrology. The Project's EMO will routinely check
the CC's operations as related to effects on hydrology, so that all potentials for adverse
effects will be suitably controlled for the purposes of expediting construction and for
avoiding and/or offsetting any conflicts with existing beneficial water uses. Following
completion of construction, the EMO will carry out periodic monitoring of effects of
project operations on hydrology in ESA, including water quality. Details of these
monitoring programs for hydrology for both construction and operations stages are given
in the EIA Main Report.
Special Design Issues
29.   Tunnel Hazards. The concerns here are that (a) the tunnel design take into
account the earthquake hazard in the region, (b) provision be made in the tunnel design to
enable prompt repair of tunnel failures, (c) the overall project plan will include sufficient
storage in the system's reservoirs to that the system can continue to function in the event



-116 -                      ANNEX5
of failure of delivery of water because of tunnel collapse or any other reason, and (d) the
tunnel construction methods will include adequate attention to worker health and safety.
In general the overall plan for the project will furnish two months' storage for the target
service area in order to (i) enable shutdown of delivery from Wanjiazhai for two months,
and (ii) furnish enough storage to overcome the hazard of tunnel collapse. Use of the
existing Fen-I reservoir for regulation will furnish the needed two months of storage.
With respect to Item (d) above, in order to ensure adequate protection for tunnel workers,
YRDP has changed the method for tunnel construction to use shield-protected core-
boring machines, which do ensure adequate protection.
30.   Equipment Erosion Hazards. Because of the high turbidity of the Yellow
River, the concern here is whether the pumps and other equipment will be eroded by silt
and thus not be able to function throughout their design life period. Project study reports
on this subject note that the turbidities will not exceed levels of 3,000 to 4,000 ppm and
that this does not represent a serious constraint to pump equipment suppliers.
31.   Reservoir Intake Hazards/Frazile Ice. This hazard is whether there will be
reservoir intake problems due to entry of ice and/or "frazile" (a kind of ice mush); hence,
the design will incorporate special precautions to guard against this hazard. In response
to this problem, YRDP design staff have developed a special type of intake design which
involves use of a weir with a grill which warms the frazile to turn it into harmless mush
which is readily managed.
32.   Disposal of Tunnel Excavation Materials. A special environmental problem for
project Phase I construction is disposal of tunnel excavation materials so as not to cause
environmental damage including damage to lands better used for farming, creation of
flooding hazards, hazards of runoff of these materials to cause pollution/damage, and
despoiling of environmental scenery. For these reasons, the project Phase I planning
includes provision of detailed schemes so that disposal will be accomplished in a manner
which is environmentally sound, as presented in the EIA Main Report Section 4.11.4,
including Figure 4.11.4-1.
33.   Silt Deposition Problems. The concern here is whether the silt in the imported
water might interfere with the project operations. The analysis of this problem shows that
the silt content of the imported water is only a small fraction, 3 percent, of the silt carried
by runoff from the Fen River watershed above Fen-1 reservoir; hence the importation
should actually alleviate existing siltation problems.
Environmental Review of Resettlement (ERR)
34.   Purpose and Scope of Task. The EIA Main Report reviews and assess the
environmental soundness of the resettlement (RS) plan presented in the project RS
Report, to ensure that the recommended RS plan will include all needed attention to
applicable environmental parameters, including effects on the RS families, on host
villages/families, and affected community/regional infrastructure.



-117 -                     ANNEX5
35.   The plan also gives due attention to the timeliness of the various RS process
components, so that preparation of the new situation facilities (houses, land, etc.) will be
ready for use at the scheduled time for moving residences and/or land uses. Because the
project does not include any new reservoirs, the RS problem is relatively small for the
project components included in Phase I. However, for EIA purposes, the overall ERR
also includes Wanjiazhai reservoir, which has a large RS problem, and the Huyan Water
Treatment Plant (and related pumping plant), which involves significant urban RS
problems.
36.   Approach for Preparing ERR. For ERR purposes, on the basis of the types of
RS problems involved, the overall ERR study has been divided into four categories as
follows:
(a)   GMT: Disturbance in rural areas to both housing and farm production
lands.
(b)   SMT and CWs:  Disturbances in rural communities only on farm
production lands, with no housing losses.
(c)   Huyan: Only urban land use changes, with no housing losses.
(d)   Wanjiazhai: Major disturbances in rural communities including both
housing and farm production lands.
37.   The project ERR has been patterned after the ERR done a few years ago for the
Xiaolangdi project. This includes several major categories, with various subcategories,
for the issues of (a) accommodating RS families, (b) accommodating host communities,
(c) regional infrastructure needs, (d) public participation, (e) monitoring plan adequacy,
and (f) overall assessment.
38.   Summary, Conclusions, and Monitoring. Review of this information indicates
that the RS Planning programs are reasonable adequate for all four RS sectors. However,
the YRDP EMO will monitor the RS progress periodically for all Phase I components
(GMT, SMT, CWs) and also with check progress for Wanjiazhai, working with the
Wanjiazhai EMO, and for Huyan, working with TEPB. This includes checking on
progress on the Phase I RS training program. In addition, the Expert Panel for
Environment and Resettlement to be established by YRDPC is also expected to make
periodic reviews and recommendations for all RS sector projects.
Public Health
39.   The significant hazards for the EIA include both enteric diseases due to
inadequate sanitation and insect vector diseases, namely encephalitis and hemorrhagic
fever. Both the construction and operation stages of the project are involved.



-118 -                       ANNEX5
40.   The recommended action program for enteric diseases and insect vector diseases
control includes the following:
(a)    Enteric Diseases:  The project's construction program  will include
provisions for protection against outbreaks of enteric diseases such as
typhoid and dysentery, by (i) provision of adequate and safe water supply
and sanitation facilities for construction workers and (ii) medical
examination (initial and periodic) for construction workers. Also the
housing buildings for construction workers should be periodically sprayed
with insecticides for mosquito control.
(b)   Insect Vector Diseases:  Phase I Project will not finance any dams/
reservoirs nor any irrigation facilities, hence Phase I will not affect these
diseases. However, it is recommended that the Phase I Project monitoring
program will include close check on incidence of these three diseases in
the overall project region and if any significant increases occur, then
special control measures should be implemented. During Phase I, it will
be necessary to monitor rat densities in the construction zones, which may
tend to increase due to the food available there, and if significant increases
occur, rat killing measures should be carried out to prevent increases in
hemorrhagic fever due to the project.
Ecology
41.   The project's Phase I will convey water to the Taiyuan Service Area by passing
through the following areas in sequence, (a) mountainous zone, where the facilities are
underground, (b) the Fen river, over a reach of some 81.2 km, (c) the Connection Works
region, for delivery of water from Fen- 1 reservoir to the Taiyuan Service Area.
42.   Effects on ecology in the mountainous zone will be negligible because the system
facilities are essentially underground. There are some 22 species of State protected
species in the mountain areas, but these are remote from urbanizing/industrializing areas
and should not be affected by the project.
43.   There will be an impact on the Fen River reach utilized for conveyance, above
Fen-l reservoir, both for flora and fauna. At present, this river reach includes no valuable
fishery, not even for subsistence, and no valuable rare species. Because the overall
project will include rigid control of pollution discharges to the river, including industrial
discharges, and because the project will add clean fresh water which will increase the
river flow volume, the river water quality should be significantly improved and this
should significantly improve habitats for both flora and fauna. The introduction of
different species from Wanjiazhai reservoir will modify the eco-balance in the river and
in Fen-1 reservoir but this should hardly affect the overall aquatic ecology in the region.
44.   The natural ecology in both the Connection Works area and Taiyuan Service Area
have been essentially displaced by existing development.

Reservoir EIAs
45.   Wanjiazhai Reservoir. The Wanjiazhai EIA shows that the project should not
cause any significant problems of enviromnental degradation, provided it is designed and
operated as planned, including incorporation of the EPMs specified in the EIA and
including environmental monitoring in both construction and operation stages, and
including implementation of provisions for resettlement as specified in the Phase I
Project RS report (see Table 10). A potential adverse effect on the project is the silt
content of the diverted water (about I percent) in possibly causing siltation/flooding
problems in the Fen river system, but the EIA analysis shows that silt content of the
imported water is much less than in the Fen River (3.3 percent), hence the effects of
importation will be beneficial. The project will result in large-scale positive benefits
including flood control and power production and availability of water for export to the
project target areas. Export of Wanjiazhai water for the project will decrease the total
water availability in the Lower Yellow River Basin, but the approved overall
governmental plan for allocation of the Yellow River water resource includes provisions
for project diversion needs.
46.   Fen-1 Reservoir.  Use of Fen-1 reservoir for project regulation, following
construction, will bring about minor changes in reservoir hydrology, but without adverse
effects, and the impact on the existing flood protection function of the reservoir will be
small compared to that from local runoff, hence no adverse effects are expected. The
imported water inflow will result in some shift in the reservoir aquatic ecology balance,
but this should not result in any adverse effects on the reservoir fishery nor on the
regional aquatic ecology.
47.   Erosion and Sedimentation. Assuming that the contracts for the CCs include
provisions as noted in the section on "Construction Constraints" and assuming proper use
of environmental construction inspectors, construction of the project will not cause any
significant erosion problems. Also, because the diverted silt represents only a small
amount of the total silt reaching the Fen River course and Fen-l Reservoir, around 3
percent, no significant impacts are expected on sedimentation in the areas along SMT.
Quality of Life
48.   People Living along Water Transmission System. The only significant effect
of the project's transmission system will be impacts on people whose houses or lands will
be taken over and utilized for these facilities. There are only a small number of such
families, and all of their losses will be compensated for, at rates such that the net effect is
expected to be beneficial for all affected families.
49.   Taiyuan Service Area (TSA).  The project will certainly result in great
improvements in quality of life in TSA, all made possible by the availability of the
imported water to alleviate the existing severe water shortage. These benefits include
(a) considerably increased family income resulting from improved industrial productivity,
(b) marked increase in per capita water use, so that residents will have decent amounts of



-120 -                      ANNEX5
water for washing and bathing and for toilets, (c) significant decrease in disease rates for
enteric diseases, stemming from steady availability of pipe water to homes/buildings, and
(d) great improvements in urban greening areas and in urban recreational areas.
Construction Constraints
50.   Historically  CCs have often caused unnecessary  environmental damage,
sometimes serious, simply because it is the nature of the CC, and of the Engineering
Supervision of Construction, to focus on expediting building of the project physical
components, with relatively low-priority attention to EPMs. However, experience has
shown that it is quite feasible/affordable for the CC to observe and comply with the
EPMs specified in EIA. These will be included in the terms of reference (TOR) for the
CC's construction contract and ECIs will be made available by EMO to observe the CC's
operations and to require compliance. Main Report Figures 4.11.2-1 and 4.11.4-1
summarize the details.
Interbasin Water Transfer Feasibility
51.   The project has been an approved component of the Government's overall Yellow
River Basin Plan for the past two decades. This will divert about 2 percent of the mean
annual river flow and about 5 percent of dry-year flows, but the Wanjiazhai storage is
from periods of higher river flow, and this should not pose hardships on downstream
water users. This issue was further investigated using the Bank's Basin Level Planning
Model. These studies confirmed that the project will not create problems for the
downstream users assuming that all "Shareholders" of the river do not extract more than
their allocated share.
Connection Works
52.   The EIA for the CWs (Connection Works), described in EIA Main Report Section
4.13, notes that (a) because the CWs are located in already developed areas, there will be
no adverse effects on forests/wildlife, (b) no adverse effects on aquatic ecology (in Fen
River and Fen-1 Reservoir) are expected, (c) no adverse effects on Fen-1 Reservoir
existing operating functions are expected, (d) no effect on archeological/historic or
cultural values are expected, (e) there will be some use of land now used for other
purposes, but only some 16 ha permanently and 235 ha on a temporary basis, (f) there
will be no significant changes in the quality of the imported water due to river passage
and reservoir storage, and (g) the only significant hazard for environment will be that for
the construction stage.
Global Environmental Issues
53.   The primary environmental concerns, from  the global point of view, are:
(a) earth-warming, (b) ozone layer increase, and (c) biological diversity degradation.



-121-                      ANNEX5
54.   Because the project components that are aboveground are in areas that are already
"humanized," with little significant remaining natural ecological resources, the project is
not expected to have any significant effects on the biodiversity situation in the ESA
region. However, the monitoring program to be managed by EMO will include an annual
survey of the status of ecology in ESA including forests, swamps, and wildlife.
55.   The project does not involve use or production of substances to be discharged to
atmosphere which will contribute to ozone layer depletion.
56.   The project will require expenditure of a considerable amount of electrical energy
for enabling pumping of the imported water into the service areas, but this total amount is
insignificant in terms of China's production of earth warming gases from burning of coal.
Hence, the project should have no significant impact on China's total contribution to
earth warming.
Water Supply, Uses and Pollution Control
57.   Water Supply and Use. Annex 7 of the SAR shows the new water supply, water
demand and balance for the Taiyuan Service Area, which will result from water imported
by the project.
58.   Water Pollution Control. The project will generate wastewater that will have to
be managed, along with existing wastewaters, so that significant environmental pollution
impacts are properly controlled and managed. The increased wastewater volumes that
will result in Taiyuan from new water have been forecasted for the years 2002, 2010, and
2020. Assuming that primary treatment is required for agricultural reuse, and that
secondary treatment is required for discharge and for agricultural and industrial reuse,
Taiyuan City has developed a plan to increase wastewater treatment capabilities to almost
100 percent for the target years. The plan is summarized in the following:
Year                             1995       2002       2010        2020
Wastewater Flow, 104 m3/day        65         114        156        207
Treatment, % of Total
Primary                            0          7         32         51
Secondary                         19         51         42         42
Tertiary                           0          0          0          7
Stabilization Pond                 0         38         26          0
Treated Wastewater %                19        96         100        100
59.   The plan calls for use of stabilization ponds in the tributaries of Fen River and
along the banks of Fen River to provide additional treatment when wastewater collection



-122 -                      ANNEX5
and treatment plants are being built. The target is to phase out stabilization ponds and
have sufficient collection systems and treatment plants in use by 2020.
60.   Cost estimates for treating wastewater generated until the year 2020 have been
developed. The estimated treatment costs for the period until 2020 are about Y 2.8
billion.
Water Quality
61.   The impact of the planned project water conveyance system on the quality of the
imported water should not be significant for all salient water quality parameters because
the system will comprise mostly tunnels and culverts that will be enclosed. However, the
receiving Fen River is an open stream and will be vulnerable to contamination. This will
require the waste management program mentioned in the section on "Water Pollution
Control."
62.   The quality of the raw water delivered to Taiyuan and other service areas will
correspond to Class III in the National Government's classification system. Based on the
available date on Yellow River water quality at Wanjiazhai and elsewhere in the Yellow
River system, it appears that the imported water delivered to the service areas will be
suitable for a raw water supply for all intended uses, with treatment needed to meet
drinking water standards. Conventional rapid sand filtration with effluent chlorination
should meet this need.
63.   The project is not expected to adversely affect groundwater quality in the ESA
except during the construction stages when use of groundwater by the CC must be strictly
controlled.
64.   Assuming implementation of the treatment program described in the section on
"Water Pollution Control," it is expected that the water quality in Fen River will not be
adversely impacted by wastewater discharges. The predicted pollution concentration in
the Fen River would be much lower than the current condition (see Table 11).
Integrated Management of Water Supply/Use/Pollution Control
65.   To ensure that industries and municipalities will treat their wastewater prior to
discharge, an area-wide regulatory/implementation agency will be established as shown
in Figure 3. This is to perform the functions currently being accomplished by several
governmental agencies with the following responsibilities:
(a)   Regulating water use to ensure optimal overall use of the limited water
supply, with priority to substitute use of treated effluent by industries in
place of using freshwater, and use of treated effluents for other reuse
purposes including agricultural irrigation and groundwater recharging, so
that freshwater use is limited to priority purposes. This will be achieved
by use of an appropriate pricing structure and by monitoring/enforcement.



-123 -                     ANNEX5
(b)   Establishing appropriate standards for wastewater treatment and for reuse
of treated wastewater as water supply.
(c)   Strengthening the existing permit system to be similar to that used in the
United States, so all industries which produce significant wastes (liquid
and solid) will build/operate their own treatment systems as needed to
protect environment. The permit system involves establishing appropriate
discharge standards, monitoring the quality of discharge effluents, and
enforcing the regulations through a penalty system for violators. River
water toxicity will be controlled, primarily by the use of the permit
system, so that existing discharges from industries will cease.
(d)   Establishing/maintaining  an environmental monitoring program  for
exercising surveillance on all waste treatment facilities, including sewage
treatment plants and solid waste disposal sites, and for ambient water
quality monitoring, as needed for achieving a comprehensive area-wide
monitoring program.
(e)   Establishing a water pricing mechanism to promote optimal water reuse.
(f)   Provision of an education and training of industrial and municipal staff
and the public about the significance of uncontrolled discharges and the
importance of waste management, to promote awareness and acceptance
of the program.
66.   The ultimate goal of the integrated management mechanics is to achieve the
optimal water use, reuse, and pollution control system shown in Figure 2. This would be
similar to the program of this type now in action in Southern California.
67.   The overall project loan includes an allocation of $8.0 million for establishing a
Clean Technologies Fund for industries.  This program  is consistent with and
supplementary and complementary to the recommendations made in the presents EIA.
Pollution Control Achievement at Taiyuan City
68.   Despite the many difficulties involved, the Taiyuan city agencies, working in
close cooperation with the Provincial agencies, have over the past decade made
impressive progress in planning and implementing a comprehensive water pollution
program in the Taiyuan service area. This includes:
(a)   Preparation of a comprehensive municipal sewerage management plan,
and implementation of the plan including treatment of some 19 percent of
the total city sewage, with planning to achieve comprehensive control by
year 2020.



-124 -                     ANNEX5
(b)   Establish of an initial permit system for control of industrial waste
discharg_s, resulting in much more plant recycling and use of in-plant
treatment to meet discharge requirements including reduction in discharge
of heavy metals.
(c)   Establishment of the initial comprehensive water quality monitoring
program, covering both pollution sources and ambient water quality of
receiving waters, to gain factual data on the extent and nature of waste
management problems.
(d)   Initiation of other measures including public education on water
conservation, reducing leakage in water supply distribution, and
promoting industrial water reuses and other reuse of treated effluents.
69.   These activities represent a good beginning step towards achieving optimal water
use/reuse/pollution control, and are firm evidence of the keen interest of the local officials
in striving to solve their water use/pollution problems and of their willingness to give real
support to achieving the goals of the proposed project.
E. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Public Participation (PP)
70.   YRDP has been active in PP work on the project even since initial establishment
of YRDP in the 1950s. These activities have increased over the years, as YRDP's role
has expanded, with detailed attention beginning in 1992.  Considerable public
participation has been taking place during 1993-97, through involvement of counties in
the project preparation activities.
Compliance with Environmental Laws
71.   Both NEPA and the World Bank require that the EIA include information
showing how the project complies with China's environmental laws and regulations. The
full-scale EIA study has included such attention to all known environmental laws and
regulations applicable to the project.
Environmental Economics
72.   The project may truly be said to be a project planned with the primary objectives
of improving the socioeconomics of the primary economic-earning areas of Shanxi
province. These are already critically short of water for virtually all human development
needs including (a) domestic and commercial, (b) industrial, and (c) agricultural needs.
The imported water will be used first for municipal purposes, with second priority to
industry to maintain employment stability, and then to agriculture. It is also planned to
reduce existing use of freshwater resources for agriculture by substituting use of treated
sewage effluents. In addition, the imported water will reduce pressures for more and



-125 -                     ANNEX5
more ground-level subsidence, already very serious and causing serious economic/
socioeconomic losses to all affected community sectors. Thus, the project may be said to
be a truly economic-cum-environmental-cum social development project.
73.   The argument may be made that the project favors the socioeconomics of the
urbanized target areas, which are less poor than the rural areas. This is true, but it is these
target areas that are of prime importance to the overall economy and socioeconomics of
the entire province. Also, where reservoirs are to be built as part of the project, it is
planned that the resettled rural farmers will be benefited, that is, their housing and income
levels will be improved as a result of the resettlement.
Risk Assessment
74.   Table 12 summarizes the Risk Assessment evaluation. The project is expected to
be a well engineered project and moreover should be financially sound because of the
precious value of the imported water for sustaining the economy of Shanxi Province. The
real risk, actually, is the risk that the project might not get built.
F. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
Description of Monitoring Program
75.   An essential component of the overall project is its Environmental Monitoring
program, which is to cover both the construction and operations stages of the project, thus
covering a period of some 25 years. The monitoring work should begin as soon as the
Environmental Management Office becomes operative in June 1997. The summarized
monitoring program to be administered by EMO is shown in Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5,
including delineation of tasks and costs.
76.   The costs for professional EMO staffing are estimated at Y 13.04 million or
$1.5875 million for the total of 25.5 years (preconstruction 0.5 years, construction 5
years, operations 20 years), average $62,000 per year (see Table 6).
Management of Monitoring Program
77.   The monitoring program is to be managed and supervised by the EMO, with
much of the detailed field work done by the ECIs and some by the EMO office staff.
However, other agencies, including the provincial EPP. Hydrographic Station, AES, and
Shanxi University are to participate in the field work in accordance with agreements with
YRDPC. Costs for monitoring work by these other agencies, which is outside their
normal scope of monitoring, are to be reimbursed by YRDPC.
Importance of Monitoring Program
78.   Note that the overall monitoring program includes essentially two components:
(a) monitoring to ensure continuing delivery of water to the service area, and



-126 -                       ANNEX5
(b) monitoring to ensure optimal use of the imported (and expensive) water in the service
area, including monitoring of water use and reuse, waste management/water pollution
control, and Fen River water quality.
79.   The monitoring costs are significant but actually very small as related to total
project costs, and the benefit/cost ratio will be large. The monitoring data will be
essential for purposes of optimal water use planning and for this reason will result in
large savings through minimization of water wastage. The monitoring is absolutely
essential to the success of the project.
G. ENVIRONMENTAL TRAINING
Need for Training
80.   Implementation of the project will be a pioneering project for Shanxi Province in
transbasin diversion of water on a massive scale, for meeting the critical needs for more
water to support continuing growth and development of parched areas of northern China.
Because of the excessively high cost of such imported water, it is essential that
conventional practices on water use, waste treatment, water pollution control, and water
reuse be reoriented to achieve an integrated comprehensive program that makes
maximum/optimal use of the precious water for all essential water uses in the service
areas (Taiyuan Service Area for Phase I) including domestic, commercial, industrial, and
agricultural needs, including balanced use of all freshwater resources (local surface water,
local groundwater, and imported water), and including institutional, legal, economic, and
financing as well as engineering aspects.
Recommended Training
81.   In order to achieve this goal, a training program is needed to strengthen the
capabilities of the officials involved in the project including YRDPC, Shanxi Province,
and local agencies, in the various new approaches and methodologies which will be
utilized. The recommended training program, shown in Table 7, is a specialized training
program to be an integral part of the Phase I project. This program, to cost an estimated
$368,500, will include training by foreign experts of selected Chinese personnel who will
then conduct training courses at Taiyuan for stuff of participating agencies, plus a visit by
a selected team to foreign countries to study integrated water r ,e technologies developed
there over the past four decades.
Value of Training Program
82.   The proposed training program should prove to be one of the most cost-effective
components of the entire project. Its total cost is small, only a very small percentage of
total first-phase investment cost, but this small investment is essential if the precious
imported water is to be wisely used. It is expected that the training program will result in
more appropriate planning decisions on investments in facilities and thus result in savings
of tens of millions of dollars over the Phase I project design life period.



-127 -                     ANNEX5
H. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN (EMP)
Introduction
83.   The  Environmental Management Plan  (EMP) comprises  environmental
management activities and institutional arrangements, particularly the Environmental
Management Office (EMO), which is designed to ensure that all of the EPMs specified in
the EIA, including environmental monitoring, will be actually carried out.
Environmental Management System
84.   To ensure effective administration of environmental management, YRDP will
create the Environmental Management Lead Group and Environmental Management
Office (EMO), whose combined responsibility is the administration and implementation
of the EMP. The Lead Group will be comprised of senior officials of YRDP, the
provincial environmental agencies, and local agencies that will have responsibilities for
undertaking specific environmental management tasks. Figure 1 shows the institutional
roles of the EMO.
85.  In addition, YRDPC will establish an Expert Panel on Environment, comprising
distinguished foreign and Chinese experts, which will meet every six months to review
YRDP progress in implementing the Phase I's environmental (and resettlement) action
programs. The scope of work by EMO and Expert Panel is to include periodic review of
the progress of MWR Wanjiazhai Reservoir Management EMO in implementing the
EPMs specified in the EIA for Wanjiazhai.
Environmental Management Activities
86.   The overall environmental management activities are illustrated in Table 3.
EMO Costs and Justification
87.   The total costs as shown in Table 6 for the EMO EMP program are estimated to
be approximately $4.194 million, for a total period of 25.5 years including 0.5 years for
preconstruction activities, 5 years for construction, plus 20 years of operation. This
averages about $164,500 per year. This cost represents a very small percentage of the
total Phase I project cost, and is very much less than what is practiced in Western
countries for similar projects. Experience has shown that the benefit/cost ratio for this
investment is very high because it is essential to ensure that the project will be
economically-cum-environmentally sound, therefore sustainable.
I. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
EIA Team and Report
88.   The EIA has been carried out for YRDPC by CIRP/Shanxi University with the
assistance of WB/EIA team members, over the period July 1995 to July 1996. The EIA



-128-                      ANNEX5
Main Report and the Executive Summary Report have been prepared in both the Chinese
version (to meet NEPA requirements) and the English version (to meet World Bank
requirements). Both versions use the same Table of Contents and are essentially the same
in substance.
Management of Significant Environmental Issues
89.   Tables 8, 9 and 10 summarize the environmental impacts of the project. It (a) lists
all of the SEIs, (b) quantifies each in terms of potentials for adverse effects if not
controlled, of potentials for benefits with feasible controls, and of net effects with these
controls, (c) shows the EPMs measures which must be taken as part of the feasible
control system, and (d) shows the net environmental effects. Table 1 shows the control
measures and, assuming proper implementation of EPMs by the EMO, the project will
achieve great environmental benefits with virtually no significant environmental losses.
Xiaolangdi Experience
90.   Because conditions for the SEIs for the project are similar in many respects to the
SEIs for Xiaolangdi, the pioneering experience of the Xiaolangdi project in managing
these issues (including construction stage problems) furnishes very valuable guidelines
for project EIA purposes.

ANNEX 6: RESETTLEMENT AND REHABILITATION (R&R)
ACTION PLAN
A. INTRODUCTION
1.    This annex describes the land acquisition and resettlement impacts under the
project, the framework developed by Shanxi Provincial Government for implementation
of R&R activities and an evaluation of R&R programs completed. Resettlement planning
of Wanjiazhai Dam and Reservoir Project, financed by the Chinese Government alone
and indirectly linked with the project, is also described.
B. LAND ACQUISITION AND ADVERSE IMPACTS
2.    The following components of the project requires land acquisition:
(a)   General Main Tunnel (GMT). GMT component includes 11 tunnels, 3
pumping stations and 4 aqueducts. The total length is 44.35 km.
(b)   South Main Tunnel (SMT).  SMT consists of 103 km waterways
including 7 tunnels with a length of 98 km, 3 aqueducts and 2
aboveground pumping stations.
(c)   Connection Works. This component consists of 40.2 km of transmission
pipelines and 6 tunnels of 16.75 km.
(d)   Taiyuan Water Supply. This component includes a new water treatment
plant and two booster stations.
Census Survey
3.    Census surveys were undertaken on the physical losses for different components
of the project. The census surveys were conducted according to the "Detailed Rule And
Regulations on Physical Loss Survey of Reservoir Inundation for Water Conservancy
And Hydropower Projects" by the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR). The surveys
were conducted by the design institutes under the guidance of the Resettlement Office of
the project in collaboration with the relevant County Resettlement Offices (CROs) and
township governments and village leaders. The census survey of GMT and SMT was
conducted in February/March 1993 and updated in December 1995. The census survey
was carried out in April 1996 for the Connection Works while the survey for the Water
Treatment Plant and Booster Stations was conducted in June 1996.



-143 -                     ANNEX6
4.    All physical losses and the number of affected persons were inventoried on
household basis and signed by the family head and the village leaders. Relevant
information is recorded on the Household Registration Information Booklet, which will
be issued to all affected households.
Adverse Impacts
5.    Adverse impacts have been identified in the following categories: (a) acquisition
of 7,393 mu of agricultural land, (b) temporary leasing of 2,495 mu of agricultural land,
(c) relocation of 23 small enterprises, (d) resettlement of 54 persons in 16 households.
The impacts are detailed in Table 1.
6.    About 1,204 persons will lose land, including 54 persons in 16 households who
have lost both land and houses and have resettled in their new houses. 273 enterprise
employees will be affected due to the relocation of their enterprises. See Table 2.
Socioeconomic Surveys
7.    Socioeconomic surveys were conducted separately for GMT, SMT and the
Connection Works.  The surveys were undertaken by the Design Institutes in
collaboration with the local resettlement offices and governments in May 1996. The
surveys established the baseline living standards of the affected persons and provide the
basis for future comparisons.
C. LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT
8.    The Chinese government has issued a number of laws, regulations and guidelines
related to resettlement planning and implementation. Resettlement under the project is
prepared in accordance with these laws, regulations and guidelines. The main laws and
regulations concerning resettlement are listed in Table 3.
D. FRAMEWORK FOR PROJECT R&R IMPLEMENTATION
9.    The Project Resettlement Office has prepared separate land acquisition and
resettlement action plans (RAP) for the GMT, SMT, Connection Works and Huyan Water
Treatment Plant in accordance with the legal framework and the Bank OD 4.30. A
framework for R&R implementation has been laid out in the various RAPs.

Compensation Policies For Different Categories of Project Adverse Impacts
11.    Land Acquisition.  Compensation for agricultural land permanently acquired is
estimated by applying specified multiplier to the average per mu annual output during the
past three years. Different compensation rates have been calculated for different types of
land in different areas, varying from Y 945 to Y 28,000 per mu. Details of compensation
calculation are provided in Table 4.
12.    Land Leasing. Compensation for land to be leased would be paid at three times
of their average per mu annual output, varying from Y 405 to Y 12,000 per mu. The
leasing period is normally two to three years, after which the project would return the
leased land fully restored in its previous productive condition. Any cost in restoring the
land productivity would be borne by the project.
13.    Structures.  Affected  structures would be compensated  at replacement cost,
which were estimated with market information in different areas and updated in early
1996. Details of the cost are provided in the RAPs.
14.    Impact on Enterprises. Affected enterprises would be provided alternative sites
free of cost. Affected buildings, structures, etc., would be paid at replacement costs
including relocation cost. Enterprise employees would be paid allowance equivalent to
monthly salaries during the period when production is stopped.

16.    Impact on Infrastructure. All affected infrastructure would either be paid at full
replacement cost or reconstructed for the affected communities.
Resettlement of the Displaced Persons and Enterprises
17.    Resettlement. This project displaced 54 persons in 16 households along GMT.
New sites were identified and provided free of cost within the same village in 1993 and
compensation was paid fully to the PAPs by 1994. The farmers have built their new
houses with the compensation and salvageable materials from the demolished houses.
They have all resettled in the new houses.
18.    Relocation of Industrial Enterprises.  The project and complementary works
would affect 23 small enterprises, including 14 quarries, 1 brick factory, 7 coal-coking
factories and 1 reinforced-concrete prefabrication plant, affecting a total of 273 workers.
One coking plant and the reinforced concrete plant would only be partially affected and
would be paid full replacement cost for the affected structures and the rest need
relocation. New sites have been identified in consultation with the owners and will be
provided free of cost. The new sites are all nearby to maintain the same source of raw
materials. Replacement cost for reconstruction have been estimated by engineers from
the project and the enterprises. The project would pay full replacement cost for the
reconstruction of the plants, transportation cost to the new sites and profit loss during
production stoppage. See details in Table 5.

R&R Strategy of Rehabilitation
19.    The project will acquire a total of 7,393 mu of agricultural land, affecting 1,204
persons. The project, based on the findings of the field investigations and analysis of
local resources, has formulated the rehabilitation strategy through land development, off-
farm employment and pension arrangement.
20.    On-farm  Development. Given the rich land resources and poor cultivation in the
affected villages, land development is planned as the major rehabilitation measure.
YRDPC RO and design institutes, working closely with township and village
representatives, conducted field investigations to analyze land resources, the current
production levels and potentials of agriculture development in each village. Village-wise,
plans have been formulated for land development through slopeland and rotation land
terracing, wasteland reclamation and on-farm irrigation works. In villages where average
per capita land holding is above 5 mu, it is planned that 854 mu of dry flat land and
1,892 mu of dry slopeland will be distributed to the PAPs out of the remaining land. On-
farm works will be conducted to increase agricultural yield. In villages where per capita
landholding falls below 5 mu, it is planned to terrace 3,713 mu of slopeland and reclaim
148 mu of wasteland, which will be distributed to the affected persons to maintain per
capita landholding. A total of 983 PAPs will be provided agricultural land.
21.    Off-employment.  Some villages in the Connection Works Component have
planned to invest land compensation in off-farm developments and provide jobs to the
affected farmers in these enterprises. Some affected farmers have seen the opportunity in
transport business and have opted for self-employment with the compensation. 76 PAPs
will be engaged in either private or collective transport business. See details in Table 6.

22.   Rehabilitation of Leased Land. The project will lease temporarily 2,495 mu of
agriculture land during construction, 1,489 mu of which is along the Connection Works.
The project will pay compensation for the leased land and return the land to the farmers
in its restored productive condition when leasing is over. The RAPs have included clear
rehabilitation standard of the leased land, the inspection and acceptance procedure and
rehabilitation schedule.
23.   Pension Arrangement. 126 elderly PAPs and children are eligible for pension in
Luyukou Village in the Connection Works Component. They will be provided Y 900 per
year per person for their pension. This pension will be provided to the old all their life
and to the children until they reach the age of 18.
24.   Support Services. YRDPC RO has drawn up detailed training program for the
affected farmers to equip them with new skills required for livelihood development
activities. PAP training will cover irrigated farming, vegetable growing, animal-rearing
and vehicle driving. The existing agricultural extension system will provide special
support to the affected villages in their livelihood development activities. They will
provide extension services to the PAPs, deliver timely agricultural input including seeds,
fertilizer, pesticide and agricultural machinery services. County governments will be
responsible for the construction of all necessary irrigation facilities.
Preferential Policy
25.   Shanxi Provincial Government has issued "Preferential Policy for Resettlement
And Rehabilitation of the Affected Persons in Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project."
Major provisions are as follows:
(a)   Any houses, public buildings, enterprise and public facilities to be
constructed under the R&R program will be exempted from charges for
urban infrastructure construction, tax for farmland occupation.
(b)   Enterprises for resettlement, collective or private, would be exempted
from income tax for three years from the time of yielding profit.
(c)    Orchard developed for PAPs would be exempted from forest and orchard
tax for 1-3 years.

(g)   Priority should be given to PAPs in providing agriculture credit and low-
interest loans.
(h)   An reservoir construction fund is planned to be created with project profits
to help livelihood development of the PAPs.
Implementation Schedule
26.   RAP implementation schedule is dovetailed with the construction plan of the civil
works. Land acquisition and resettlement for the GMT had been completed by April
1996 while livelihood development activities are still underway and will be completed in
1997. Land acquisition on SMT, started already, will continue till the end of 1998 and
livelihood development activities will continue till 2001. RAP implementation will start
in 1997 for the Connection Works and will be completed in 2001. RAP implementation
for the Water Treatment Plant started in 1996 and will be completed in 1997. YRDPC
RO has prepared a detailed CPM schedule of all land acquisition and livelihood
development activities for all components of the project. This CPM schedule will be
used to monitor the progress of R&R activities and will be updated semiannually.
Institutional Framework
27.   A complete R&R institutional framework has been set up for the implementation
of land acquisition and resettlement under the project.
28.   Project Bureau (YRDPC). It is responsible for overall R&R implementation on
behalf of Shanxi Provincial Government.
29.   Project Resettlement Office (YRDPCRO). YRDPC RO has been established
within YRDPC with four full-time staff, experienced in resettlement. It has the overall
responsibility for the planning, coordination, supervising of land acquisition and R&R
activities and R&R staff training under the project.
30.   Field Resettlement Offices. Resettlement offices have been established in the
three field construction offices, each with three to five staff. They are responsible for
land acquisition, contracting with local governments, supervising R&R progress. They
will provide necessary support to CROs and TROs in RAP implementation. They will
report to YRDPC RO.
31.   County Resettlement Office (CRO). CROs have been set up in each of the
affected counties, each staffed with 5 to 10 persons. They are responsible for the
planning and implementation of livelihood developments, payment of compensation to
affected villages and coordination of land acquisition, resettlement and civil works. They
will submit quarterly R&R progress reports to the field offices.
32.   Township Resettlement Office (TRO). TROs have been set up in the township
governments. They are mainly responsible for disseminating resettlement policies to



-152 -                      ANNEX6
affected villages, supervising and assisting villages in land development and land
redistribution.
Participation And Consultation
33.   Project R&R planning has been undertaken in a participatory manner.  All
relevant line agencies, administrations, entities and communities were consulted
systematically in R&R planning. Particular attention was devoted to the participation of
and consultation with the affected communities.
34.   Project information was disseminated to the PAPs at an early stage. Information
dissemination meetings were held at the village level, where project information, possible
adverse impacts, suggested compensation rates, resettlement arrangements, proposals for
rehabilitation were presented and discussed with the PAPs. The RAPs were revised with
suggestions from the PAPs. A resettlement information booklet was prepared. After the
review of the RAP by the Bank, the RIB will be reproduced and distributed to all the
PAPs' households.
35.   Village leaders and representatives of the villagers participated actively in the
census and socioeconomic survey carried out by YRDPC RO, CROs and design
institutes. The results of the census were recorded and signed by village leaders. The
villagers have also contributed to RAP preparation, particularly in the formulation of
livelihood development programs.
36.   Consultation with the affected communities is planned to continue until the
project is completed. Field surveys and meetings have been held with affected villagers
to evaluate the completed R&R programs along the GMT, SMT and propose additional
measures. YRDPC RO plans (a) to undertake bimonthly regular surveys of the affected
persons over R&R implementation, covering, at least, 40 percent of total affected persons
and (b) to hold public meetings with affected persons once a month to improve R&R
implementation.
Grievance Mechanism
37.   Shanxi Government has grievance redress offices at various levels. They have
been notified to give special attention to redress of grievances from PAPs regarding any
aspects of land acquisition and resettlement under the project. PAPs can approach these
offices to seek redress of their grievances. PAPs also have the right to appeal to the court
to seek resolution of their grievances.
38.   Apart from the existing grievance redress mechanisms, Shanxi Government has
established a three-stage grievance channel for project PAPs:
(a)   If any affected person is aggrieved by any aspect of the resettlement and
rehabilitation program, he/she can lodge an oral or written grievance with
the TROs through the village committees. In case an oral complaint is



-153 -                     ANNEX6
made, it will be written on paper by the village unit and processed.
Village Administration Committee or the TRO will resolve the issue
within two weeks.
(b)   If the aggrieved person is not satisfied with the decision reached in Stage
1, he/she can bring the complaint to the attention of the CRO within one
month from the date of the receipt of the decision taken in Stage 1. CRO
will reach a decision on the complaint within two weeks.
(c)   If the aggrieved person is not satisfied with the decision of the CRO,
he/she can bring the complaint to the attention of the YRDPC RO within
one month from the date of the receipt of the decision in Stage 2. YRDPC
RO will reach a decision on the complaint within three weeks.
39.   Detailed procedures for redress of grievance and of the appeal process will be
publicized through posting in the affected villages and their adequacy will be monitored
throughout RAP implementation. All grievances will be recorded in standard formats.
Monitoring and Evaluation
40.   Monitoring includes both internal and external monitoring. The primary target is
to (a) evaluate the progress of R&R programs implementation, and (b) modify and
improve R&R plans as necessary during implementation and evaluate the result of R&R
programs.
41.   Internal Monitoring. Internal monitoring of the R&R programs is part of the
overall project management. YRDPC RO will be responsible for internal monitoring,
that will be conducted through the R&R institutional setup. The monitoring indicators
would include, at least, institutional capacity, R&R staff training, land acquisition, land
leasing, payment of compensation, land development and redistribution, off-farm
development activities, PAP training, restoration of public facilities, relocation of
enterprises. Monitoring reports would be submitted quarterly and semiannual monitoring
reports will be submitted to the Bank as part of the overall project progress report.
Detailed reporting formats have been developed and are attached to the RAPs.
42.   External Monitoring. YRDPC plans to have the Resettlement Office of Yellow
River Water Conservancy Committee (YRCCRO) as its independent external monitor for
the project. YRCCRO will set up a monitoring team for the project, staffed with 15
resettlement specialists including 5 senior staff. External monitoring would focus on
(a) the physical progress of RAP implementation, (b) evaluation of livelihood restoration
and living standard improvement, (c) PAP participation and consultation during
implementation, (d) effectiveness of grievances redress mechanism and (e) proposing
measures for improvement.
43.   External monitoring will be conducted through regular consultation meetings with
the affected communities, regular field visits, structured and random sampling of the



-154 -                                ANNEX6
affected persons on living standard. Living standard will be monitored on a sample basis.
A data base will be maintained and updated twice a year with first hand data. Two living
standard surveys will be conducted among the affected population, one after two years of
resettlement completion and one at the completion of the project. YRCCRO will submit
its semiannual monitoring reports to YRDPCRO and the Bank throughout the project
implementation  period.   Detailed  monitoring  indicators, survey  questionnaires  and
reporting formats have been developed and attached to the RAPs.
44.    Environmental and Resettlement Advisory Panel. The project has established
a seven-member international Environment And Resettlement Advisory Panel. The panel
will meet twice a year to review R&R progress, propose measures for improvements.
The panel will submit its report to both the project management and the Bank.
Costs
45.     The total cost of land acquisition and resettlement under the project is estimated at
Y 51.33 million, of which Y 36.80 million cover rural resettlement, Y 3.30 million cover
relocation of enterprises and Y 11.24 million cover the remaining cost items. Total cost
is allocated across project components as follows: Y 7.33 million for GMT, Y 12.41
million for SMT and Y 20.35 million for Connection Works. Price contingency is
estimated at 7 percent and is included in the annual costs. Shanxi Province Government
will finance all costs for land acquisition and resettlement. The cost breakdown and

46.   All compensation will be paid before acquisition and a disbursement procedure
has been established to ensure timely payment of compensation. YRDPC RO will pay
the funds for land acquisition and resettlement to its field offices, who will disburse the
funds to CROs. CROs will deliver the funds directly to villages, who will use land
compensation for productive purpose and pay the PAPs for their private assets lost.
E. EVALUATION OF COMPLETED R&R UNDER THE PROJECT
Land Acquisition And Resettlement
47.   Land acquisition for the GMT has been completed. Land acquired included
1,129 mu of cultivated land, 67 mu of riverbank land, 420 mu of rotation land, 7 mu of
orchards, 99 mu of forest land and 69 mu of bush land. A total of 714 mu of land were
leased. A total amount of Y 6.87 million have been paid for compensation. Some
114 mu of land have been acquired in seven villages for the SMT and the total amount of
compensation paid is Y 0.28 million.
48.   The resettlement of the 16 households is completed. The PAPs are resettled
within the same village. Their new houses are larger in area and of better quality.
Livelihood Development Activities
49.   Land development has been going on. So far 1,560 mu of land have been
redistributed in the affected villages including the newly developed and terraced land.
Land development will be completed in October 2001.
50.   The project improved the infrastructure in the villages along the transmission line.
Three highways have been constructed in Pianguan County with a total length of 127 km
and one road has been rehabilitated with a length of 25 km. As a result, 23 villages have
become accessible through the new highways. The project has drilled 12 deep wells
along the GMT and has provided 3,000 people and 750 large animals in 10 villages along
the line with drinking and irrigation water. The project helped with the power supply for
over 400 households by building over 6 km of transmission lines.
Living Standard Survey
51.  In April 1996, Tianjin Water Resources and Hydroelectric Design Institute of
MWR conducted a survey to evaluate living standard improvement among PAPs along
the GMT and the SMT and local economic development with the project. The survey is
undertaken by random sampling 26 percent of PAP households and collecting data
through secondary sources. The survey indicates a remarkable improvement in living
standards of the PAPs and fast economic development in Pianguan County with the
project:
(a)   Diversified sources of income. The number of households with no other
source of income than farming dropped from 82 percent in 1992 to 12



-156 -                      ANNEX6
percent. Most of the families have either opened family business, sideline
activities or have members working as temporary laborers.
(b)   Increase of average per capita income from Y 100 to Y 833 in 1992 to
Y 625 to Y 5,000 in 1995. While 59 percent of the households had an
average annual per capita income of below Y 500 in 1992, 1995 witnessed
59 percent of them enjoying an average per capita income of over Y 3,000.
(c)   An impressive possession of modem electronic apparatus and vehicles
such as color TVs, small tractors, refrigerators, stereo systems, motor
bikes and washing machines, rare before the project started.
(d)   Improved housing conditions with better quality and larger area.
(e)   Access to clean drinking water.
(f)   The 152 km of highway have created a transport network within Pianguan
County connecting 15 townships and have greatly improved transportation
for the affected villages.
(g)   With the project, the number of construction companies in the county
jumped from 67 before the project to 189 in 1996 with the total revenue
increased by 400 percent. Private transport businesses increased from 58
in 1992 to 1406 in 1996 while the number of restaurants went up by 300
percent.
(h)   Since the project started construction, new  enterprises have been
established, including 2 cement plants, 35 quarries, 21 kilns, 46 brick
factories and 50 new shops along project transmission lines with about
4,500 employees.
F. WANJIAZHAI DAM AND RESERVOIR PROJECT
Introduction
52.   Wanjiazhai Multipurpose Dam and Reservoir Project (WJZP) is a local project
financed by the Ministry of Water Resources, Shanxi Province and Nei Mongol Region.
It is located on the Yellow River, which separates Shanxi Province and Nei Mongol
Region. The reservoir would provide 1.4 billion m3 annually to the area. Shanxi
Province plans to channel its share of water through the project, to be financed by the
Bank.
53.   The reservoir damsite construction affected three villages. Its resettlement started
in 1993 and was completed in 1996. Reservoir inundation would affect 60 villages in
two counties and one banner and 90 percent of the affected population are in Qinshuihe
County in Nei Mongol Region.

Resettlement Planning
54.      Inventory and Socioeconomic Surveys.  Resettlement planning started in 1989.
The census survey was conducted in February 1990, updated in 1993 and 1996. The
census was carried out by the Regional, county, township resettlement offices and design
institutes. Villagers participated actively in the surveys.
55.      Resettlement Impacts. The project will submerge 60 villages in 10 townships in
three counties, inundating 5,171 mu of farmland. A total population of 6,047 will have to
be resettled including 4,645 PAPs losing houses and 1,402 persons only losing land. The
main categories of losses and the number of affected population is detailed in Table 8.
56.      Resettlement Objectives.   Resettlement action  plans were  prepared  for each
county by county resettlement offices. The overall objective of resettlement is the
restoration and improvement of the current living standards of the resettlers and will be
materialize through four specific targets of (a) economic development in reaching, at
least, the same level of the hosting population in average per capita output value, income
and grain consumption; (b) social development with an enhanced level of education,
technology, improved health services, better health and rehabilitated and improved
infrastructure in transportation, telecommunication and power; (c) environment
development in expanded forest coverage, reduced earth erosion and better treatment of
gas and water pollution in the resettlement areas.

57.   Resettlement. Based on the analysis of local resources, environment carrying
capacity and infrastructure conditions, resettlement strategy has been worked out for each
of the affected villages. Affected persons will be resettled within the same village as
much as possible and 813 persons will be resettled this way. Where outside resettlement
is necessary, the villages will be moved as a whole. After field investigations and close
consultation with both the resettlers and host communities, the resettlement offices have
identified 21 resettlement sites for 5,669 persons. Detailed survey and design have been
completed for each resettlement site, covering residential houses, public facilities, water
supply and sewage system, power transmission lines, broadcasting lines, road and
irrigation facilities. PAPs will be provided allowances for transportation, income loss
during transportation and subsidy for medical care.
58.   The principle of rehabilitating the affected enterprises is to restore their current
productive capacity. The design institutes worked with the affected enterprises and has
drawn up different rehabilitation schemes for each of the enterprises. The cost of
rehabilitation is fully budgeted, including compensation for lost assets, relocation cost,
compensation for profit loss and etc.  Many of the enterprises plan to take this
opportunity for technical renovation.
59.   Rehabilitation schemes have been worked out for affected infrastructure.
Relevant design institutes have estimated the replacement cost and have designed the
reconstruction of the infrastructure. The reconstruction cost is fully budgeted in the
project resettlement cost.
60.   Tianjin Hydropower Design Institute and Nei Mongol Archaeology Research
Institute conducted a survey on cultural relics and have drawn up an action plan for
protection, relocation and retrieving the relics.
61.   Livelihood Development. Livelihood rehabilitation will be conducted for 6,430
people (in the year of moving), including 5,085 people in agriculture, 1,210 people in
industries, service sector and 135 people opting for self-employment. Agricultural
development has been planned in detail for each resettlement site. All plots of land have
been identified and surveyed.  Irrigation facilities have been designed for land
development. It is planned to develop and improve 13,941 mu of low-yielding land, to
develop 5,511 mu of irrigated land, 4,686 mu of dry land and 3,017 mu of grassland.
Industrial jobs will be provided to 746 PAPs (total population is 1,210, including
children) in new enterprises or existing enterprises to be expanded. These enterprises
have been identified. Feasibility studies have been conducted for each of them and
approved by county governments.  These factories will sign contracts with the
resettlement offices for employing the PAPs and they cannot unilaterally dismiss any
PAPs. Part of the power profits will be set aside as a special fund to support PAPs in
their livelihood development.
Cost and Budget
62.   The total reservoir resettlement cost is Y 510 million and the cost breakdown is
detailed in Table 9.

Resettlement Implementation Arrangements
63.      Organization.   A  multilevel institution  has been  set up  for WJZ  resettlement
implementation.   The resettlement office  in  WJZ  Reservoir Construction  and
Management (WRCM), under the guidance of the Resettlement Office of Ministry of
Water Resources, is responsible for the WJZ resettlement implementation. Both Shanxi
and Nei Mongol have established resettlement offices at provincial, prefecture, county
and township level. The resettlement office of WRCM will operate as the supervisor of
the WJZ resettlement implementation, and will monitor resettlement progress. The
county resettlement office would undertake internal monitoring on resettlement progress.
YRCCRO will be contracted as the independent external monitor for R&R monitoring
and evaluation. The Environment and Resettlement Panel will also review the progress
of WJZ  Reservoir  resettlement progress.   Detailed  monitoring  indicators, reporting
requirements and formats have been developed and attached to the RAP.
64.      Implementation  Schedule.   Resettlement schedule  is  detailed  with  reservoir
impounding schedule. Resettlement is to be completed by the end of 1998 and livelihood
development activities will continue till 2000. A detailed CPM schedule is developed
and attached to the RAP.

Damsite Resettlement Evaluation
65.   The construction of the dam, started in 1994, affected three villages, i.e.,
Wanjiazhai in Shanxi Province on the left bank and Yaozimaoshen, Shidaoqingshen in
the Nei Mongol Region on the right bank. The census survey was completed in early
1993. A resettlement action plan was prepared respectively for the Left Bank and Right
villages and was approved by the Ministry of Water Conservancy (MWC) in December
1993. Resettlement offices have been established in Wanjiazhai Project Construction
Corporation, the affected counties and townships to coordinate and implement land
acquisition and resettlement.
66.   Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The project acquired 7,482 mu of land,
including 5,706 mu of cultivated land affecting 664 persons. Land acquisition was
completed by 1995 and compensation was fully disbursed. Twenty-four people in 6
households who lost houses to the project have resettled in new houses. The income
rehabilitation component is 80 percent completed and will be completed by the end of
1997. The total cost for land acquisition and resettlement was estimated at Y 26.82
million and has been fully paid. The budget was later adjusted to Y 34.80 million with
increased compensation rates. An additional Y 7.98 million is to be disbursed to the
affected villages.
67.   Livelihood Development. Livelihood development is planned through on-farm
and off-farm activities. For the two villages on the right bank, the planned development
of 1,640 mu of wasteland has been completed and distributed to affected villagers, raising
their per capita land holding above preproject level.
68.   For the Wanjiazhai Village on the left bank, the arrangement is (a) to develop land
for on-farm activities for 111 PAPs, including 50 mu for vegetable, 10 mu for nursery,
100 mu for orchard, 300 mu for fruit trees, melons and corn; (b) to develop animal
husbandry for 63 PAPs (pigs, sheep, cows, chickens, fisheries); (c) to provide
employment for 30 PAPs in service industry; and (d) to provide industrial employment
for 44 PAPs (food processing plants and bean product processing). Fifty-eight old people
are on pension arrangement. R&R is well in progress and 80 percent of livelihood
development activities have been finished. They are expected to be completed by the end
of 1997.
69.   Living Standard Survey. The living standard survey conducted in the three
villages indicates a significant improvement of living standards, infrastructure and public
facilities. The sample survey shows a sharp increase in household income. Wanjiazhai
Village saw an average per capita annual income increase from Y 127 in 1990 terms to
Y 1,200 in 1995. The three villages are now enjoying greatly improved infrastructure,
such as road, telecommunication facilities, water supply system, education and health
care facilities.

ANNEX 7: PROJECT ECONOMICS
A. ECONOMIC GROWTH AND WATER DEMAND
1.    Taiyuan is Shanxi Province's capital, largest city, and principal industrial
complex. The area to be served by the WWTP Phase I includes Taiyuan City, the north
and south suburbs, and the adjacent county of Gujiao. Combined, the urban population
was 1,672,000 in 1993, and the rural population, 532,000. Taiyuan had 7.2 percent of
Shanxi's population in 1993, but produced 18.3 percent of its industrial output, including
11.2 percent of coal, 14.6 percent of electricity, 31.2 percent of chemicals, 48.0 percent of
metallurgical products, and 28.8 percent of other industrial output.
2.    Table 7.1 reports current and future population, industrial output, and water
demands by consuming sector as projected by YRDP staff and the Tianjin Design
Institute. These projections have been carefully worked out using projected population
and industrial growth rates, and water consumption "norms" used in China-wide planning
exercises. Combined, they show total water consumption increasing from 437 million m
in 1993 to 784 in 2000, 1,000 in 2010, and 1,196 in 2010, with implied compound rates
of growth of 8.7 percent between 1993 and 2000, 2.5 percent between 2000 and 2010,
and 1.8 percent after 2010.
3.    There are two significant problems with these forecasts. First, they undoubtedly
understate both growth in population and industrial output in the early years of the
forecasts. We know that the Taiyuan urban population has been growing in excess of 3
percent per year, but the projections use only a 1.2 percent rate for the entire period 1993-
2000. We also know that industrial growth has been averaging 15 percent in recent years,
while the projections assume only 8 percent from 1993 to 2000. These considerations
imply that the forecasts are far too conservative. Second, the projections ignore any
impacts of price on demand. Prices of both household and industrial water supplies have
been increased recently, and are scheduled to rise much faster in the near future.
Heretofore, water prices were so low that there was no need for a distinction between
projected "consumption" and projected "demand". But with household water prices
scheduled to triple, and industrial water prices scheduled to more than quadruple, this
distinction becomes important. For these reasons, the forecasts have been recomputed,
taking into account both the recent growth in population and industrial activity, and the
influence of the projected higher prices.  The changes will affect only the main
consuming sectors industries and households which includes municipal water
consumption. At the same time, we will produce a range of forecasts-low, medium, and
high-recognizing the inherent difficulty of making such projections in a rapidly
changing area.

4.    The assumptions about the growth in Taiyuan's population, industrial capacity,
and water consumption are shown in the top part of Table 7.2. Those assumptions
pertaining to household and municipal (H&M) water demand are taken from projections
prepared by the Taiyuan Water Company, which rely on the most recent data available,
and contain assumptions relevant to the local economy. Combined, the assumptions
produce the forecasts for H&M demand shown in the bottom left portion of Table 7.2.
The "medium" case, which we expect will have the highest probability of proving true, is
somewhat higher than the YRDP/TDI projections given in Table 7.1. The difference is
mainly due to the higher population growth rates assumed (which more closely match
recent trends), and to the inclusion of "municipal" demands (firefighting, urban landscape
requirements, etc.) which the YRDP/TDI projections omitted.
5.    The middle part of Table 7.2 gives the assumptions pertaining to the revised
industrial water demand forecasts. Whereas YRDP/TDI assumed an 8 percent growth in
industrial activity until 2000, slowing to 5 percent and ultimately 4 percent, the Mission
feels this assumption is conservative, and may be characterized as the "low" case. The
preferred "medium" case assumes a 10 percent growth after 1995 (1993-95 averaged 18
percent), then slowing to 7.5 percent and finally 5 percent after 2010. The assumptions
about growth in the productivity of industrial water approximate those of YRDP/TDI.
The higher growth rates would have produced a higher demand forecast except for the
influence of the higher prices which have been taken into account. We have assumed a
price elasticity of -0.1, which results in, for example, the 2000 water consumption
declining from 530 million m in 2000 to only 327 because prices for industrial water are
scheduled to increase from about Y 1.0/mi3 to 5.8 (YRDP/TDI projected demand in 2000
to be 382 ignoring any price effects). The low (in absolute value) elasticity assumed is
justified for several reasons. First, Taiyuan's firms have already made great strides in
reducing consumption per unit of output in reaction to physical water shortages. Second,
even the higher prices will not significantly affect profits of most industries, as water
costs will remain a small part of total costs. Third, the assumption that there will be
continuing productivity gains with or without price changes implies that there will be
ongoing, long-term adjustments to both price and probable future shortages which the
Project will be unable to eradicate in total.
6.    The bottom part of Table 7.2 show the water demands used for the economic
analysis for H&M, Industry, and the categories combined. We assume that the rural
consumption of humans and livestock will be met by local surface water and
groundwater, and that all irrigation demands will be met from these sources plus treated
wastewater from the Project, as discussed below.

B. WATER RESOURCES
7.      Taiyuan's water resources may be classified as surface and groundwater. Surface
water resources include local runoff and diversions from the Fen Reservoir, located 50
km upstream of Taiyuan City. Local runoff is primarily usable only by agriculture,
because there are no water storage facilities of consequence other than Fen reservoir. The
reservoir directly supplies, via a dedicated pipeline, about 36.5 million m3/year to Gujiao,
an industrial/mining complex north of Taiyuan. Virtually all of the remaining supplies
are diverted to the large irrigation districts bordering the Fen River. These irrigation areas
are also suffering severe water shortages: only 80 percent of irrigable land received any
water in most years, and supplies are only half those required for optimal yields. In recent
years, runoff to the Fen has been low and apparently declining, due to extensive terracing
upstream to limit erosion, and construction of small-scale dams. Compared to long term
trends, each of the of the years 1989-93 is classified "P95" (very dry) because local
runoff has averaged less than 50 million m3 compared to a long-term  average of 127.
This water source is not considered a viable alternative to WWTP as a supply source for
Taiyuan because (a) further curtailment of water supplies to the irrigation districts would
further exacerbate poverty and unemployment, (b) there are no physical diversion
structures in place at present to supply the City, and (c) the available supplies would be
far from sufficient to alleviate Taiyuan's present and projected shortages.
8.      As  shown  in  Table  7.3, Taiyuan  relies- on  groundwater for most of its
consumption. In 1991, 83 percent of consumption by households, municipal entities, and
industries came from groundwater, with the percentage rising to 87 percent in 1993. The



-165 -                          ANNEX7
Gujiao diversions from Fen Reservoir are included in the "surface" category; without
them, the percentage from groundwater in 1993 is 97 percent. Sustainable groundwater
supplies have been estimated at 307 million m3/year for the entire Project Area, of which
35 million m3 are used outside the City for irrigation and "rural life" purposes, leaving
272 as the long term groundwater resource available. In 1993, Taiyuan's consumption
from groundwater exceeded 312 million m3, implying overextraction of 15 percent. In
fact, groundwater extraction has exceeded the sustainable level in every year since 1989,
a situation which cannot continue much longer without dire environmental consequences.

C. WATER SHORTAGES
9.     In 1993, water consumption in Taiyuan totaled 437 million m3. If the measurable
shortages in the urban and industrial sectors are included, water demand was at least 538
million m', for a deficit of 101. If there had been no overdraft of groundwater, the
shortage would have been 146 million m', or 27 percent of demand. In addition, farmers
in the project areas were getting only about one-third of the fresh water they needed (part
of their deficits were made up by using untreated sewage and industrial wastewater),
implying the true deficit was over 30 percent.
10.    Combining the household, municipal, and industry water demand projections of
section A and the sustainable local groundwater supplies available to meet these demands
we can predict the future water shortages as shown in Table 7.4. The middle part of the
Table represents the volumes which the WWTP will attempt to supply.

D. ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROJECT
11.   If economic growth in the Project Area is to continue, and the urban population is
to receive adequate supplies of water, additional sources of water must be found.
Potential sources include (a) more intense use of local water, (b) importing surface water,
and (c) reallocation of existing water from other uses (irrigation).
Local Water
12.   There is strong evidence that groundwater is already overexploited, and has been
since the late 1980s. The evidence comes from both a comparison of extractions with
estimates of sustainable yields, and from observations of declining water tables and
increasing incidence of land subsidence. The question is not whether increased extraction
of groundwater can be tolerated, but whether current levels can be sustained to the year
2000 when the Project water is scheduled to become available.
13.   Taiyuan City is situated near the upper end of the Upper Fen Basin, an enclosed
hydrological entity that relies almost entirely on snowmelt and far upper reach runoff for
the river flow. There is negligible offtake above Taiyuan City and its northern suburbs,
but virtually unlimited demand for water in and around Taiyuan and downstream for
irrigation. The utilization rate has been as high as 74 percent in recent years, which is
probably the highest in the Yellow River Basin, and cannot be increased given the
seasonality of flows and high sediment content during flood periods. This level of
utilization has resulted in the river bed often running dry much of the year, and a dramatic
decline in the irrigation supplies to downstream farmers.
Importing Surface Water
14.   The alternative sources for importing surface water are either from adjacent
subbasins within Shanxi, or from the Yellow River. Conceivably, Taiyuan could receive
water diverted from the adjacent Northwest or Hotuohe basins. Two factors make these
options virtually impossible. First, water shortages are prevalent throughout northern
Shanxi, and are intensifying everywhere. Only in the west is excess surface flows
projected, and these occur mostly in flood season drain directly to the Yellow, at points
remote from the Taiyuan water demand center. Second, the division of Shanxi into
subbasins follows the pattern of intervening mountain ranges, which would need to
crossed if water were to be diverted. These ranges are as high as 3,000 m and would
involve insurmountable technical and economic difficulties.
15.   The above discussion implies that only importation of water from the Yellow by a
project such as Wanjiazhai can meet the projected water demands. Alternatives neither
can supply the volumes required, or would pose even greater difficulties and higher costs
than Wanjiazhai. Is, however, Wanjiazhai the best location on the Yellow for the
diversions? It is probably the only location that is feasible. Above Wanjiazhai the
Yellow River turns westward, requiring longer and more costly diversion route, and one
that encroaches on Nei Mongol. Below Wanjiazhai, the Loess Plateau begins with its



-167 -                     ANNEX7
associated runoff with high silt concentrations, which would engender prohibitively high
treatment costs.
Reallocation of Existing Water
16.  In 1993 irrigation accounted for 83 million m3 (19.0 percent of total consumption)
in Taiyuan. Only about half of this was fresh water. Downstream of Taiyuan the major
irrigation districts (Fen-I and 2) receive about 200 million m3/year diverted from the Fen
Reservoir. In these areas as well as the entire Province, irrigation consumption as a
percentage of total consumption has been declining as water has been diverted to
municipal and industrial uses or sold by farmers who have water rights. However, not all
of the current irrigation supplies could be diverted to M&I uses. Irrigation demands are
seasonal, peaking in the Spring months, whereas M&I demands are relatively constant
throughout the year. The larger irrigated areas are not located near the cities, so that
measurable reallocation would require investments in both surface water storage and
conveyance. Those irrigated areas located near Taiyuan supply important and valuable
produce to the City, supplies which would be difficult and costly to procure elsewhere.
But the most important reason why reallocation from irrigation should not be pursued has
to do with poverty alleviation. Most of Shanxi's poor are rural, and most rural residents
rely on agriculture for the bulk of their incomes. Without irrigation, agriculture in Shanxi
is a precarious undertaking because of low and unpredictable rainfall. Irrigated yields are
double those of rainfed land, and could be much higher were irrigation water available in
ample supplies. Agricultural incomes are probably quadrupled when crops can be
irrigated. In 1994, farm wages were only 33 percent of wages in manufacturing. Thus,
any further reallocation of water from farmers would have serious negative income
effects on this group which is already the poorest of Shanxi. Furthermore, the volumes
involved would still be insufficient to meet the projected deficits in Taiyuan.
The "Do Nothing" Alternative
17.   With current water shortages in Taiyuan amounting to 30 percent or more of
estimated demand, and growing rapidly, and both ground and surface water supplies
declining, failure to complete the project would engender economic, social, and
environmental calamity. If Taiyuan's urban and rural residents are allocated supplies
equally YRDP's projected demands, then no fresh water would be left for agriculture, and
industrial output would fall far short of its potential:
Percentage of Demands that can be Met
Irrigation    Industry  Lost Output (Y million)
2000                0%         74%                8,166
2010                0%         43%               29,415
2020                0%         23%               58,384
The impact would be felt throughout China given the heavy reliance on northern Shanxi's
coal, heavy industry, and chemical output. Hundreds of thousands of skilled workers



-168 -                      ANNEX7
would need to be relocated, and vast quantities of mineral and fossil resources would go
unexploited. It is not surprising that Chinese planners have mentioned the possibility that
Taiyuan (and Datong as well) would need to relocated (at incalculable cost) if project
water is not forthcoming.
E. PROJECT BENEFITS
18.   Benefits arise primarily from water shortage alleviation in the industrial and urban
consumption sectors. There may be secondary health benefits, but these have not been
quantified. Farmers near the project areas would benefit from additional supplies of
treated sewage and wastewater. There would also be environmental benefits because the
additional water would halt the overexploitation of groundwater. In the following
sections we describe how the economic benefits of YRDP water are estimated for its
intended uses for urban consumption, industry, and possibly, irrigation. In general, we
will seek to obtain marginal economic values based on sound economic principles
applied to the situation pertaining in the project areas. Furthermore, we will take a
conservative approach where a choice is obvious, preferring to err on the low side of
benefit estimation.
Value of Water in Urban Consumption
19.   The use of water receiving the highest priority from local policymakers is for
3
human consumption. In 1994, urban households in Taiyuan consumed 59.24 million m3,
and rural households, 14.6, in the project area. In terms of liters per day, the urban figure
is 91.5 per capita, which is less than half the China norm of 200 for the year 2000. Even
so, the consumption figure includes items that are not strictly household consumption,
such as household-based commerce. Recent survey work shows that about half of
Taiyuan households consumed less than 40 liters/day. The per capita consumption by
rural residents amounts to 18 liters per day, while the norm for 2000 is 70. Based on
departure from China-wide norms, it is clear that both groups suffer severe shortages that
can only worsen in the absence of the YRDP.
20.   The analysis below will derive the value of water to urban consumers, and assume
that this value will also apply to the much smaller group of rural households in the project
area.
21.   A commonly used measure of the benefits from household consumption is
willingness-to-pay (WTP). If consumers state, directly or indirectly that they are willing
to pay so much for a unit of water, then that value is commonly taken as the benefit for
project analysis. Sometimes consumer surveys provide estimates of WTP, sometimes a
lower bound on WTP can be inferred from what other consumers in similar situations are
paying. In China, urban water consumers are paying Y 1.8/mi3 in some coastal cities of
size similar to Taiyuan.
22.   Alternatively, WTP can be estimated from consumer demand functions if the
required data are available. The method is illustrated in Figure 7.1.

Q0  Qd           volume/year
The point Po, Qo is observed. For Taiyuan, total "urban life" consumption in 1994 was
110.8 million m3, adjusted to 77.56 to allow for 30 percent losses in distribution. Given
the existence of shortages and intermittent supplies, we know that (Po,Qo) is a point
interior to the urban demand function, DD'. We first seek a point on DD' for the current
price of 0.7. The China norm of 200 for cities of Taiyuan's size gives an approximation,
implying that (0.7,129.5) is a point on DD' pertaining to 1994. In the figure, this is
represented as Po,Qd. Given an estimate of the price elasticity of demand, i, we can
trace out the complete demand function. For a constant elasticity function, the formula is
Q=AP'T, where A is a constant. A typical short-run value for ii is 0.2.7 Solving for A, we
can complete the demand function (A=120.6). WTP, the point on the demand function
corresponding to the current supply, is Y 9.09/m3. This high value, however, depends in
large part on the highly inelastic short-run elasticity assumed. Furthermore, WTP is valid
for only small changes in supply, not the very large changes envisaged by the Project.
23.   When changes in supply are large, the appropriate measure of benefits is
consumers plus (plus the underlying price). In the short run conditions applying to 1994,
CS is Y 4.19/m3, which, when added to the price of 0.7, yields a value Y 4.89/m3. In the
longer run, it is widely recognized that price elasticities are less inelastic because
consumers have time to adjust habits and replace water-using appliances. In general,
long run elasticities are taken to be twice (in absolute value) of short run, which, other
things equal, results in lower values for both WTP and CS.
24.   Table 7.5 extrapolates the data over time. Column (2) is the projection for urban
population in the Taiyuan Project Area, which is assumed to continue to grow at 3
7 Price elasticities of demand are notoriously difficult to estimate because of the influence of a variety of
nonprice factors: 0.2 is within the range of many estimates from developed countries.

percent until 2000, 2 percent for the next decade, and 1 percent thereafter. Column (3) is
target consumption norm, and column (4) is the implied annual demand net of losses.
Column (5) is the annual deficit assuming that water supplies cannot grow from their
1994 levels in the absence of the project. Column (6) is the assumed price elasticity,
which increases in absolute to reach -0.4 by 2001, the first year of Project water supply.
Column (7) is the computed demand function constant term. Column (8) is the calculated
WTP for the Qo supply, (9) is the CS per cubic meter, and (10) is the implied value.
Note that until 2001, the increase in elasticity outweighs the increase in demand, so that
both WTP and CS decline. After 2000, the elasticity is assumed constant, and demand
growth causes WTP and CS to grow thereafter.

25.    In 2001, the year in which benefits are to begin accruing, the value in terms of
WTP is Y 4.13/m3, while by the CS measure, it is Y 2.41/m3.  Again, WTP would be
valid for a small increase in supply. But the Project will result in a doubling of
consumption over what would be possible without it, so we must take the more
conservative measure of CS. In other words, WTP effectively assumes a perfectly elastic



-171-                      ANNEX7
demand function, which does not introduce a large error for small changes in Q, but
certainly does so when the changes are large.
26.   The consumers' surplus values are adopted for the measure of benefits from
increased urban consumption brought about by YRDP, and will be applied to the rural
consumers as well. From Y 2.41/m3 in 2001, they rise continuously over time as
population growth causes a rightward shift in the demand function.
27.   Column (10) shows the current price for household water, and the schedule of
price increases adopted by the Shanxi Province Commodity Price Bureau. By 2000, the
Bureau will be charging Y 3.66/mi3 for household water, a price designed to capture most
of the cost of Project water. The above analysis shows that this price is between the WTP
pertaining in 2001 (4.13) and the CS for that year (2.41). CS will reach the administered
price about the year 2010.

The Value of Industrial Consumption
28.   Of all water-consuming sectors, only industry has the potential to generate
sufficiently high economic returns to justify the Project. A rudimentary procedure,
summarized in Table 7.6, indicates that the returns might be in the neighborhood of
Y 34/m3. In this table, we simply take the average, weighted by projected water use by
industrial sector, of value added per unit of water. (The average return will be equal to
marginal return up to some point because of the existence of present and future water
shortages leading to underutilized capacity.)

weighted average industrial sectors:    67.31
29.    Apart from  shadow-pricing, to which we will return, the main reason why this
method is likely to be erroneous has to do with the interconnectedness of industries.
More than half of industrial output in Taiyuan supplies intermediate demand, i.e., is an
input to other firns' production. Consider the coal industry. For every yuan of output,
Taiyuan's coal firms buy Y 0.53 of inputs from the other sectors, which must use water in
their production of these inputs. The true marginal return to water in the coal sector
cannot be as high as Y 47, because all other sectors supplying inputs have lower returns,
and it is impossible to increase the output of coal without increasing the output of the
others.
30.    A  convenient method of analyzing the industrial sector is through the use of
Input-Output (1-0) models for the following reasons:
*  1-0 models provide a consistent accounting framework
*  1-0 models explicitly recognize the interconnectedness of most economic
activity
*  1-0 models can easily be linked with more rigorous analytical techniques such
as linear programming
Input-Output modeling has a rich background in China. It proved highly useful in central
planning, and continues to be used to produce economic forecasts.8 A significant boon to
this study is the existence of both a Shanxi I-0 model and models for all of China which
have recently been projected up to 2020. The Shanxi model was originally developed for
1987 conditions, then updated to 1990. It consists of 28 sectors, and includes important
8 Described in Chinese Economic Planning and Input-Output Analysis, Karen R. Polenske and Chen
Xikang, eds., Oxford, 1991.



-173 -                       ANNEX7
detail on water demands.9 The China-wide models were developed for a World Bank-
sponsored study on greenhouse gas emissions, contain 18 sectors, and are available for
1990 plus projected versions to 2000, 2010, and 2020. Together, these models permit us
to develop a projected Shanxi model aggregated to the level of detail appropriate for the
analysis of the project.
31.   In its basic form, an 1-0 table of n sectors consists of a transactions matrix T of n
rows and n columns, where each element tij is the purchases of sector i from sector j in the
measured year. The sum of any column of T is the total purchased inputs of that sector,
and the sum of any row is the total intermediate products of the sector represented in that
row. The basic table is completed by noting that the total output of each sector may be
divided into that part which meets other industries' inputs, and that component which is
final demand. In matrix notation,
£jTjj + Yj = Xi
where X is total output and Y is final demand. In a regional 1-0 table, Y is typically
expressed as Y* + E - M where Y* is local final demand, E are exports from the region,
and M are imports to the region. In this analysis we need not be concerned with regional
trade flows, so the collapsed form will be used. Thus a negative Y1 implies that M i >E j,
(the region is a net importer of the sector's product). Another most useful identity is that
the sum of a given sectors' purchases, plus the payments to its factors of production, is
also equal to total output:
Xj T1J + Vj = Xj
where Vj is the sum of factor payments, or value added.
32.   The most common use of an 1-0 table is to predict the changes in the total output
and value added of an economy's sectors when an exogenous change such as an increase
in final demand occurs. Therefore, Tii is normalized by dividing each transaction of each
firm by the sum of transactions of that firm:
Aii = Tii /Ej Tii
Then, AX + Y = X, X(I-A) = Y, and X = (I-A)-'Y so that total output may be expressed
as a function of final demand. Note that the system of equations is closed and fully
interdependent. Any change in any parameter of one sector will affect all other sectors.
In particular, a change in the final demand of say, the agricultural sector, will influence
all other sectors from which agriculture purchases inputs and/or services.
9 The model was prepared by Chen Xikang for the 1994 Project Identification Mission. His reports are
available in project files.

33.    The full 28-sector Shanxi model contains far more detail than can be used by this
study: sectoral output and water demand has only been projected up to 2020 for six
sectors: agriculture, coal, electricity, chemicals, metallurgy, and "other" for the Project
Area; Shanxi-wide projections output has only been projected to 2000, and for these six
sectors as well. Thus the 28-sector model was first aggregated to these six sectors. Table
7.7 shows the aggregated 1990 transaction table.
34.    The Tij elements appear in the top six rows of numbers and reflect the purchases
of the sectors heading the columns from the sectors listed in the rows. For example, the
agriculture sector purchased Y 2,137 million from "itself," 41 million from the coal
sector, etc. The relative size of these elements is an indication of the interconnectedness
of the industrial system. For example, agriculture is highly dependent on the chemical
sector; the coal sector on power, chemicals, and metallurgy; and power on coal.
35.    The column "Inter(mediate) Demand" is the sum  of the row elements and is total
sales to other firms for use as inputs. Final Demand is the difference between Total
Output and Intermediate Demand, and comprises final demand by Shanxi consumers,
(plus) exports from the Province, (less) imports to the Province, and changes in stocks
over the year. From these data, it can be seen that only in the metallurgy sector is Shanxi
a net importer.

37.   Several modifications to the 1-0 table are required before it can be used for
analysis of the project. First, it must be extrapolated to the future. Second, it must be
shadow-priced. And third, it must be converted to the level of Taiyuan. Extrapolation is
necessary because the underlying coefficients change with technical progress and changes
in the orientation of industrial activity. Fortunately, this work has been done for China-
wide 1-0 tables, and we can adopt those changes to the Shanxi model. Table 7.8 tracks
the sequence of calculations involved.
38.   The procedure for obtaining the Table for 2000 is as follows: (1) compute the Ajj
matrices for the China-wide models for the years 1990 and 2000; (b) calculate the rates of
change of the coefficients as ratios; and (c) apply the ratios to the 1990 Shanxi table. The
calculations are shown in top parts of Table 7.8. The top block is the 1990 aggregated Aii
matrix described above. The second block is the ratio of 2000 coefficients to 1990
coefficients from the China-wide matrices. A departure from unity implies that changes
in interindustry relations is projected. For example, most sectors are projected to have
lower requirements for agricultural and coal inputs, and most will place a greater reliance
on "other" sectors which includes electronics, transport and communications. Projected
technical progress can be noted from the sum of the input coefficients: if these fall (as
they do in all but agriculture and coal), then the same output can be obtained in the future
with less total inputs.
39.   The projected changes we have introduced to the Shanxi Aii 1-0 matrix are
expected to have two types of effects: (1) changes in relative intersectoral demands for
inputs, and (2) evidence of an overall decline in intermediate demands relative to total
demands, i.e., technical progress in production. We now check for these effects by
applying projections in total output to the projected A1j matrices described above.
40.   The fourth block of Table 7.8 corrects for the most significant price distortions
which occur in the electricity sector. The shadow price of electricity is 35 fen/kWh
compared to an average financial price of 13.33 in the 1990 data. Therefore, the output of
the sector ELECT was increased by 35/13.33, and the value added and final demand
figures adjusted as well to maintain the identities. In addition, the ELECT row of the A1i
was adjusted upward to reflect the higher costs, and the value added of all firms
purchasing electricity reduced by a corresponding amount. The final block of Table 7.8
applies the total output projections for Taiyuan in 2000 to obtain a 2000, shadow-priced
transactions table for Taiyuan.

Input-Output and Linear Programming
41.   Despite its statistical and accounting merits, an 1-0 table cannot tell us what the
marginal value of water is to any given sector. But a simple transformation of the basic
1-0 structure into a linear programming model can.
42.   Recall that the general form of a linear programming (LP) model is
maximize Ej cjx;
subject to X- A 1j xj = bi for all j, and xj 2 0
where the xi are activity (variable) levels, cj are objective function coefficients, A is a
matrix of technical coefficients, and bi are resources available. The equality constraints
may be changed to inequalities of either direction through the implicit introduction of
slack activities.
43.   An equivalent LP model of an I-0 model is
maximize L:j vjO;
subject to Zj (I-A)1jOj = Dj where Oj are levels of sectoral output, vj are ratios of value
added to output, I is an identity matrix, Ai3 is the normalized 1-0 transactions matrix
described earlier, and Dj are final demands. Because an 1-0 model is fully closed, one
has a choice among which variables to constrain, and which to allow to vary. Either OQ or
Dj may be allowed to vary, and the model solved for the remaining set. In this example,
we first assume that the system is demand constrained, and set upper bounds on the Dj
equal to the 1990 observed levels of net final demand, and permit to Oj to vary. In
addition, we also add a set of water constraints
ij w Oi < W
where wj is the amount of fresh water required per unit of output, and Wj is amount of the
water allocated to sector j. All data required for the LP model are available from Tables
7.7 and 7.8 above. A solution to the LP yields shadow prices on the W constraints which
are the derivatives of the objective function (total economic value added) with respect to
a small increase in the volume of water supplied-indeed the definition of marginal value
added.
44.   The results of these experiments, performed for each sector (except agriculture)
produce the following values:
COAL               78.9 (yuan/m3)
ELECT              43.7
CHEM               29.6
METAL              45.8
OTHER              34.5
weighted average    41.9



-178 -                       ANNEX7
Note that the weighted average value is substantially less than the 67 obtained by the
simple method earlier. Again, these values represent the impact, on value added, of an
additional unit of water focused on the listed sectors. We say focused, because all of the
increase in final output permitted by the experiment may come only from the sector
selected. Some of the additional water allocated must go to each of the other sectors, but
only to the extent that it is required to permit the increase in final demand for the selected
sector. The numbers reflect 1995 price levels with the exception of the shadow pricing
of electricity and fertilizer described earlier.
45.   First, benefits in the early years are much higher than in later years due to
discounting. Second, values for years later than 2000 become progressively lower as will
be seen in the next section.
46.   An implicit assumption in using the LP model to generate the marginal values of
water is that water is the constraint (apart from the technological relationships built into
the input-output matrix). That is, if water is available, then output could increase and
generate the values described above. In other words, there are no other constraints such
as labor or industrial capacity which could prevent these results from occurring. Clearly,
labor is not, and is not likely to become a constraint in Shanxi. Industrial capacity is not
now a constraint, as evidenced by unutilized capacity, and the projections of capacity to
2000 and beyond suggests that it will be even greater in the future. Once the existing
capacity is fully utilized with YRDP water and new capacity comes on stream, the above
values will overstate the true benefits. This is because economic theory tells us that firms
will select technology so as to equate the marginal return of an input to its expected long-
term price. If labor is expected to be very expensive in the long term, then firms will
choose capital-intensive technologies to reduce the labor cost. Likewise, firms will
choose water-using technologies based on their perception of the long-term cost of water.
3
We assume the long-term cost of water to be Y 5.8/mi. This means that, given a
sufficiently long period of time, the marginal returns of water will tend toward this value.
We further assume that plant and equipment life is 30 years, so that new plant coming
onstream in 2000 will be based on the Y 5.8 assumption.
47.   T   calculation of "old" industrial capacity, that subject to the high marginal
returns as we have estimated, is shown in Table 7.9 based on the assumptions outlined
above. The phased marginal values, based on this projection of "old" capacity, is given
in Table 7.11 for "new" (the long run water price) values of 5 and half that level. The
table shows that the average value will steadily decline and reach 5 by the year 2030
when all existing plant and equipment have been retired.

48.   Note that the Y 5 figure is not crucial to the final economic appraisal: in the early
years after 2000, most plant is of the existing variety and still subject to the high returns.
In the later years when the average marginal return declines, the benefits are heavily
discounted in the rate-of-return calculations. Furthermore, even halving the assumed
value of 5 produces an average return, for example, for Taiyuan, only 14 percent lower in
2010.
Irrigation
49.   Agricultural activity in the Project Area may be divided into (a) urban "truck
gardens" producing mainly fresh vegetables for the city, and (b) field crops produced in
the surrounding areas. In addition, there is a large irrigable area (c) south of Taiyuan
stretching all the way to the Yellow River.
50.   With the possible exception of (a), project water will be too expensive to be used
directly for irrigation. YRDP has included the demand of truck gardens in their water
demand projections, but we have separated them. They amount to 108 million m3 in



-181-                      ANNEX7
2000, 120 million m3 in 2010 and 132 in 2020. Because of the proximity to Taiyuan of
this production, and the fact that high-valued crops predominate, we assume that this
demand will receive precedenze in allocations of any available after M&I demands are
met. Such water may come from excess supplies during "wet" years, or from treated and
reused wastewater. Marginal economic returns are assumed to be Y 4/m3. Under the
category (b) suburban irrigation, there are 300,000 mu within the Project Area. YRDP
demands assume an irrigation norm of 550 m3/mu and distribution losses of 40 percent.
The demands decline over time under the assumption that losses will be reduced and
efficiency of application will increase.
51.   Downstream of the Project Area lie 3.8 million mu of irrigable in the Fen Upper-
Middle Region, and 2.9 million mu in the Lower Fen Region. Projections using the
Provincial Planning Model indicate that water shortages under P75 conditions will be 43
percent in the Upper Fen and 34 percent in the Lower Pen by 2000, and growing
thereafter. Effectively, then, water demands in these areas are infinite with respect to
potential water deliveries from the Project.
52.   The Provincial Agricultural Bureau has projected cropping patterns for these areas
shown in Table 7.11, and provided farm survey materials used to produce crop budgets
for the main irrigated crops (crop budgets appended to this Annex). These patterns and
budgets were used to estimate the marginal returns to water shown in the right-hand
column of Table 7.10. Returns are higher in (b) than in (c) because the mix of crops is
more heavily weighted toward fruits and vegetables, and because distribution losses are
lower.
F. THE PROJECT
Water Deliveries and Allocations
53.   The combined economic benefits from the WWTP will ultimately depend on how
much water is diverted from Wanjiazhai to the Project Area, how much is left after
transmission losses, and how much is allocated to each sector. A variety of factors
determines how much water will be diverted: pipeline capacity, water allocations,
demand, and capacity of treating and distributing the Project water. The complete
WWTP has been allocated 1,200 million m3 of Yellow River water, a volume which
holds Shanxi province to the limits of consumption established by the SPC. Of this total,
640 million m3 has been allocated to the Taiyuan Project Area by Provincial Authorities,
with the remainder reserved for Phase II. Diversion works have been designed to handle
this volume. Diverted water must be treated for sediment and bacteria, and this will be
done at Huyon Treatment Plant to be constructed for that purpose. Huyon's capacity will
be designed to accommodate the expected volume of diversions, although  the
"lumpiness" of the works implies that there may be occasional bottlenecks in the early
years of construction and operation.
54.   Table 7.12 summarizes expected diversions, treatment, and distribution of Project
to the primary beneficiaries. Column (1) is demand net of local groundwater in the



-182 -                                ANNEX7
medium case as described in Section (A). Column (2) is the volume of diversions at
Wanjiazhai required to meet that net demand, taking into account losses in distribution
and treatment, the 640 maximum diversion limit, and the scheduled capacity of Huyon
[column (3)]. Losses in distribution are estimated at 7 percent, and Huyon is expected to
lose 9 percent, mainly from evaporation from the sedimentation tanks. The 640 limit is
not reached until 2010. Huyon capacity will be a constraint on the system in 2002 and
2006 if the demand projections and other assumption hold, but only by small margins.
Column (4) gives the feasible inflow to Huyon, and column (5) the outflow after losses in
treatment. Columns (6) and (7) allocate treated water to industries, households, and
municipal demands in the same proportions as the projected demands. These are the
volumes upon which the primary benefits from the Project are obtained. Column (7) is
the total supply from local groundwater and Project water net of all losses, and column
(8) is the remaining water deficit, if any, again according to the medium demand
projections.

55.    The left part of Table 7.12 quantifies the underlying assumption.  The column
"Water Deficit" is the volumes needed to close the gap between demands and local
supplies. "Needed Diversions" is this volume inflated to allow for losses in transmission.
"Allowed Diversions" takes into account the future limits on allocation imposed by the
overall project and from the fact that eventually the water must be shared with Datong
and Pingshuo when Phase II is completed. We assume that 480 is the maximum allowed
diversion to Taiyuan up to 2010, and 640 by 2020 (by agreement, Taiyuan is to receive
53 percent of Wanjiazhai water). Note that by 2005, deliveries will already be less than
deficits, not taking into account additional supplies from treatment and reuse.



-183 -                            ANNEX7
56.    The next columns allocate the deliveries to the consuming sectors urban life ("To
HH") and industry. This allocation does not reflect current policy, but is a means of
allocating benefits, which are disproportionately larger for industrial uses than for urban
consumption. The stated allocation assumes a division proportional to water demands in
the two sectors. The column "M&I Ben's" is the total economic benefit in 1993 prices
based on the assumed allocations and the economic values derived in the previous
section.
Water Treatment Program
57.    At present, only 19 percent of wastewater in Taiyuan receives primary treatment.
The Project will ensure that this proportion eventually reaches 100 percent, and that the
treated water is recycled to industry and agriculture. Table 7.13 shows the planned
volumes by type of treatment. Part of the wastewater receiving secondary treatment may
be resold to industry for reuse. Plans for doing so have yet to be completed; therefore we
assume that all treated water will be made available to irrigation, first serving the
"suburban" areas, and then the downstream areas. The right part of Table 7.13 shows the
volumes which may be diverted to these irrigation uses, deriving the benefits described in
the previous sections.

Project Costs and Phasing
58.    The size and complexity of the WWTP have led local planners to prefer a phased
construction program, beginning with the General Main and South Main, followed by the
North Main at a later date. This schedule would permit the first water deliveries to
Taiyuan in the year 2000, and deliveries to Pingshuo and Datong about 2005.  The



-184 -                               ANNEX7
components of the project which permit deliveries to Taiyuan are referred to as "Phase I",
and have total costs amounting to $1,412 million as described fully in Annex 2. The
timing and allocation of these costs are shown in Table 7.14 below.
59.    Estimates of Phase I project financial costs amount to  $1,150 million.  The
phasing and allocation of these costs are shown in Table 7.14 below.

60.    In addition, there are several types of variable economic costs associated with
diverting and supplying water, shown in the bottom part of Table 7.14. First, there are
operating costs which are applied to all water diverted and include power costs of
pumping, system management costs, and maintenance. Operating costs are estimated to
be Y 1.22/mr3 in 2002, declining to a long-range value of 1.04 due to economies of scale.
Second, Yellow River water will require desiltation and additional treatment at the Huyon
plant to be constructed as part of the project.  These treatment costs begin at Y 0.83/mr3
in 2002 and decline to Y 0.46/m3, and are applied to that part of water not lost in
transmission. The electricity component of the operating and treatment costs are shadow-
priced at Y 0.35/kWh. Finally, there are opportunity costs of Yellow River water which
reflect benefits forgone by downstream hydropower installations and irrigators. These
were estimated using the Yellow River Basin Model, and are Y 0.6/mr3 in 1996 prices.
G. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE PROJECT
61.    The economic performance of the Project is estimated with an economic cash
flow model based on the construction cost schedule given above, the benefits described in
section E, and the following assumptions about allocation policies:



-185 -                      ANNEX7
(a)   WWTP water will be directly supplied to households, municipal and
industrial demands only, in proportion to the demands of these sectors
(approximately 30 percent to H&M, and 70 percent to industries).
(b)   Eighty percent of water supplies will be returned for treatment and reuse
by irrigators. Treatment by type will follow the schedule given above in
Section F, and the water first delivered to irrigation demands within the
project area (so-called truck gardens) up to the limit of estimated annual
demand of 108 million m3. The remainder of treated wastewater will be
released into the Fen River for use by downstream farmers.
62.   The basic cash flow model is shown in Table 7.15 up to the year 2020, after which
most of the entries are constant throughout the life of the project.
63.   Based on the assumptions contained in these cost and benefit streams, the
"medium" growth and demand projections, and a 50-year project life, the EIRR of the
project, including wastewater treatment and reuse, is estimated to be 22 percent. It's net
present value discounted at 12 percent (to 1996) is Y 10,221 million. Increased H&M
consumption generates 7 percent of these benefits, industrial consumption, 83 percent,
and reuse in irrigation, 10 percent. These returns exclude any difficult-to-measure
environmental benefits from the elimination of groundwater mining, and from the
removal of health risks associated with inadequate urban water supply.
64.   When the costs of constructing and operating the treatment plants and water
retention ponds are removed, and the benefits from the use of the treated water in
irrigation are excluded, the rate of return is 20.4 percent (Table 7.16). This option is
clearly not preferable because treated wastewater benefits are distributed to a much wider
group of people, including the poorest farmers.
H. PROJECT RtSKS
65.   The major physical risks involve construction mishaps and delays, and seismic
events which could destroy the tunnels and connecting works. Construction risks are
deemed to be within manageable limits given close supervision by foreign and Chinese
experts. Nevertheless, a 1O percent cost increase has been included in the base case cash
flow model. The probability of an earthquake of a sufficient magnitude (7.0 Richter
scale) to damage the works is estimated to be less than 0.01 percent over the construction
period. As shown in Table 7.16, a 50 percent increase in construction costs (after 1996)
would still yield a rate of return of 17.4 percent, and a two-year delay in obtaining any
benefits would still produce a 17.3 percent return.

66.    The Project is also  robust with  respect to  the estimates of losses in  the
transmission system  and costs of operating it. Doubling the losses reduces the rate of
return from  22.0 to 20.7 percent, while doubling the operating costs reduces the rate of
return from 22.0 to 20.4 percent.
67.    Because the benefits from  increased water consumption by industries constitute
such a large proportion of total benefits, the estimates of these returns are critical to the
Project's performance. The analysis used a combination of input-output analysis and a
linear programming model to arrive at a more conservative value for industrial water than
more straightforward methods. The value was estimated to be about Y 31/in3 in 2002,
declining to a long-run value of 5.8-the eventual price of water charged to industries. If
these returns are reduced by 25 percent, the project still yields a rate of return of 17.5
percent.
68.    An additional concern is that future flows in the Yellow River may be insufficient
to the supply the Project's diversions. A simulation over the 56 years of available
hydrologic data showed that sufficient water will be available in all months and all years
if upstream diversions are held to currently agreed provincial allocation limits. However,
demands for Yellow River are insatiable, and failure to abide by the limits on the part of
provinces upstream from Wanjiazhai could jeopardize the project if flows are sharply
curtailed.
69.    The Project will ensure that all wastewater will be treated and most of it will be
made available to farmers. Without this component, the rate of return falls marginally to
20.6 percent, implying that this strategy is economically attractive, as well as providing
significant environmental and income distributional impacts.

H. IMPACTS ON BENEFICIARIES
70.   The Project's direct beneficiaries are urban households, and workers in factories
and mines.  Farmers will benefit indirectly.  Urban (household plus municipal)
consumption will increase from 90 million m3 (147 l/c/d) to 165 million m3 (225 l/c/d) in
2002, bringing it in line with Chinese norms. After 2010, when the Project Area again
begins to experience water shortages, per capita consumption will begin to decline
moderately, but still remain at acceptable levels throughout the Project's time horizon.
71.   The most dramatic impacts affect industrial workers.  Without the additional
water from the Project, employment and incomes in the area will almost certainly begin
to decline in the near future as population growth continues to demand more household
water (given precedence by policymakers), and local water supplies continue to diminish.
In Table 7.17, the "without" project projections assume a 3 percent annual growth in the
productivity of labor, and a 2 percent annual growth in real labor income. By 2002,
120,000 jobs will be lost to the water shortage, with the number increasing thereafter.
With the Project water, employment and income growth can continue. In 2002, this
means an increase of 98 percent in both employment and incomes over the without
Project scenario. By 2010, the differences become very large.

2010          452         1,495         2,708        8,962          231

72.   In 1995, there were 41,930 farm households in the Project Area, holding 154,770
people with a per capita income of Y 1,443 ($175). These people will benefit in two
ways which are difficult to quantify. First, they will have full use of their local surface
and groundwater resources, part of which has been diverted to urban and industrial uses
in recent years. Second, those within the City who operate truck gardens will have first
call on the treated wastewater. The volumes they require are estimated to be 108 million
m3/year. Heretofore, they have had to rely on sporadic rainfall and untreated wastewater.
73.   Farm families in the counties downstream of Taiyuan will get the remainder of the
treated wastewater, projected to be 74 million m3 in 2002, rising to 326 million m3 after
2020. There about 66,700 farm households in the counties adjacent to the Fen, with a
population of 239,000. Their per capita income in 1995 was only Y 1,317 ($158). If we
assume that all of the increased production translates directly into increased income (the
primary effect of additional water is additional yield, requiring little more expenditure
than farm labor), then the Project will increase the incomes of these people by 23 percent
in 2002, 45 percent in 2005, and ultimately will almost double it.

ANNEX 8: ASSUMPTIONS TO FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
A. YRDPB
Pricing Methodology
1.     Water tariffs delivered by YRDPC to TMWC are projected by following steps:
a) obtaining annual capital requirements;
b) determining financing plans;
c) calculating total project cost by appropriate cost allocations (cost sharing);
d) forming necessary operational and financial assumptions;
e) setting up water tariffs based on a minimum  debt coverage ratio of 1.2 or a
minimum rate of return on fixed assets in service of 2 percent, whichever
gives a greater tariff, to make YRDPC financially sustainable and to provide
assurance of cost recovery and debt repayment.
2.     A summary table for above (a) to (c) is listed below.

Capital Requirements
3.    Although investment in Wanjiazhai Dam and phase II investments are not within
project scope, responsibility of timely investment in such constructions is at YRDPC.
Therefore, they have to be included in YRDPC's total capital requirements and also be
taken into account when determination of YRDPC's overall financing plan and financial
projections.
4.    Total capital requirements during phase I is estimated to be Y 13.55 billion prior
to interest during construction (IDC) (see Annex 8, Summary of Estimate Project Cost
and Financing Plan), or Y 14.07 billion if IDC is taken into account (estimated unrealized
foreign exchange loss of Y 165 million is a noncash capitalization item).
5.    Capital requirements by years for the proposed project are estimated by technical
group who based on planned project schedule as well as market price of labor and
materials. As explained above, capital requirement for phase I before IDC from financial
perspective is based on a different scope from  that of Costab summary.  The
environmental management and institutional component, Y 0.2 billion in total, are not
included in the cost estimate for YRDPC's financial forecasts as YRDPC may not be
responsible for implementation and future debt repayment for those components, while
YRDPC's capital requirements include investment in Wanjiazhai Dam of Y 2.23 billion
that is not covered by Costab summary. As a result, YRDPC's capital requirement before
IDC, Y 13.55 billion, is about Y 2 billion more than that on the Costab.
6.    Total capital requirements during phase II is estimated to be Y 10.8 billion (see
table attached on project costs and financing).
Financing Plan
7.    To finance phase I capital requirements, YRDPC will need to obtain GSP
surcharges as well as to borrow.  Sources of funds are assumed to be used in the
following order and purposes:
(a)  The World Bank loan and the cofinancing loan will be used to support
foreign currency requirements within project scope;
(b)  Investment income from Wanjiazhai Dam can be used to finance the
proposed project;
(c)  GSP surcharges can be used to finance Wanjiazhai Dam and project scope
activities if shortage of funds still exist after use of previous two financing
sources; and
(d)  if shortage still exists, like during 1997-98, additional surcharges or
incremental water revenue as a result of water tariff adjustment will be
needed.



-194 -                     ANNEX8
8.    As YRDPC will be in operations during phase II and will have the capability in
self-financing partial phase II investments after debt repayment, financing plan for phase
II only consists of YRDPC's internal cash generation and GSP surcharges; no borrowing
is assumed.
Cost Sharing
9.    Because both phase I and phase II investments include both SMT and NMT
components, and because capital requirements and financing plan are determined at
YRDPC's overall perspective, cost sharing between SMT and NMT with regard to
several investment items is required in order to determine fixed assets cost, depreciation,
and water tariffs.
10.   GMT cost is a common cost for SMT and NMT and thus will be shared by
estimated eventual water volume delivered, 56.5 percent and 43.5 percent, respectively.
Investment in Wanjiazhai Dam is a long-term investment, thus will not subject to cost
sharing.
11.   Cost for SMT consists of shared GMT cost, cost to complete SMT, and cost of
connection works, which equals to 81.72 percent of total phase I investment cost
including capitalized interest and foreign exchange gain/loss. That is, only 81.72 percent
of total phase I cost will be considered in determination of water tariffs to TMWC
starting from year 2002; the remaining 18.28 percent of cost will belong to NMT and will
not subject to depreciate until completion of NMT.
12.   Similar treatment applies to phase II. Among phase II investments, 27.66 percent
and 72.34 percent will be allocated to SMT and NMT, respectively.
Assumptions to Financial Projections
13.   General Assumptions.    1995 actual financial status is used as base for
YRDPC's financial forecasts. 1996 price is used as a reference when projecting cost and
expenses. The following domestic and international inflation are currently adopted by the
Bank and used in making projections:
1997  1998  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005
Domestic          6.2   5.8   5.5   5.5   5.5   5.5   5.5   5.5   5.5
International     1.7   2.2   2.5   2.5   2.5   2.5   2.5   2.5    2.5
Income Statement Parameters
14.   Water Diversion and Sales Volume: The project completion is estimated at the
end of year 2001 and thus year 2002 is estimated to be the first water diversion year.
Volume of diverted water from Wanjiazhai Dam and water deliveries to Huyan water



-195 -                       ANNEX8
treatment plant are both taken from economic analysis report. Water diversion and
deliveries will increase over years (see below) in line with the Huyan water treatment
plant's capacity expansion.
2002 2004 2006 2008 2010
Diverted water at Wanjiazhai Dam (million m3)   293   382   451   551   640
Delivered water at Huyan treatment plant      273   356   420   514   596
15.   Water Tariffs: Tariffs are driven by the minimum debt service coverage ratio of
1.2 (2003-2016) and a minimum ROA of 2 percent (from 2011 onward) as set out in
Loan Agreement.
16.   Other Operating Revenue: It is assumed that 72 percent of Taiyuan water sales
volume can be recycled, treated, and reused. Tariff for recycled water is estimated at
Y 0.2/m3. It is assumed that YRDPC will get 50 percent of proceeds from sales of reused
water as its other operating revenue.
17.   Operating Costs: Operating costs consist of personnel, power cost, repair and
maintenance cost, water resource fee, depreciation, and other expense.
18.   Annual salary is estimated to be Y 8,000 per person in year 2002. Additional 14
percent of base salary is estimated to be fringe benefit. Total number of employees for
YRDPC is assumed to be 1312. Such personnel cost will then escalate by local inflation
rates each year.
19.   Power consumption rate is assumed to be at 2.38 kWh per m3 diverted water over
the project implementation period for the South Main. Power cost is based on 1996 price
of 32 fen/kWh and will escalate by local inflation rates.
20.   Repair and maintenance cost is assumed to be at 1.65 percent of the total fixed
assets cost (historical cost), which consists of 1.5 percent for maintenance/labor and 0.15
percent for materials, and will escalate with the local inflation rates. Water resource fee
will be levied at 2.7 fen per m3 water diverted. Other expenses is assumed to be 0.35
percent of the total fixed assets cost and will escalate with the local inflation rates.
21.   Straight-line method is used in deriving depreciation. Depreciation is provided at
2.3 percent of the fixed asset cost annually.
22.   Other Tax and Fees: YRDPC does not need to pay value-added-tax (VAT),
which is generally levied at 6 percent of revenue net of VAT for water supplying entities,
but it is still obliged to pay other tax and fees on top of imputed VAT. Urban
construction and maintenance tax is levied at 7 percent of imputed VAT, educational fees
3 percent, and surcharge for price adjustment fund 2 percent.



-196 -                     ANNEX8
23.   Investment Income:  Investment income is to capture YRDPC's share in
Wanjiazhai Dam's net income, which will mainly come from electricity sales revenue.
24.   Interest and Foreign Exchange Gain/Loss: Interest during construction and
foreign exchange gain/loss will be capitalized into project cost. After project completion,
interest and foreign exchange gain/loss will be recognized as current expense. Interest on
foreign loans during construction period is assumed to be financed locally and paid off in
the current year.
25.   Income tax is assumed to be 33 percent of income before income tax.
26.   Appropriation of Net Income: Net income is assumed to be appropriated in the
following order: (1) welfare fund and development fund, which account for 15 percent of
net income; (2) dividends, if any; (3) increase in retained earnings.
Balance Sheet Parameters
27.   Cash: During SMT construction period, no annual cash increase is assumed, i.e.,
annual fund resource is assumed just enough to cover annual capital expenditures.
Starting from SMT operation in 2002, however, YRDPC will have cash surplus after
repayment of debt due to compliance of minimum financial covenants. Such cash surplus
plus additional surcharges from provincial government are assumed to be used in north
main construction.
28.   Accounts receivable is assumed to be 4.16 percent of current year revenue, or a
turnover rate of 24 per year.
29.   Inventory is assumed to cover adequate materials for 3-month maintenance.
30.   Prepayment of construction cost was Y 211.731 million at end of 1995. That
stands for payment for the project but not yet qualified for recognition of a WIP. It is
assumed that by end of each year, similar situation would occur and thus the same
amount remains until the proposed project is complete when WIP is transferred to fixed
assets. Therefore, in year 2002, fixed assets increase includes both transfers from
cumulative WIP as well as from the balance of prepayment.
31.   Long-term  investment is assumed to capture YRDPC's investment in
Wanjiazhai Dam and Fen Reservoir 2. As equity method will be adopted to recognize
YRDPC's investment income, power revenue from Wanjiazhai Dam has been estimated
under Investment Income projections. Because such long-term investments are also
financed by GSP surcharges, capital requirement for them is taken into account in
determination of YRDPC's overall financing plan.
32.   Fixed asset cost is cumulated and transferred from work-in-progress cost, which
includes capital investment cost, interest during construction, commitment fees, and
foreign exchange gain/loss. Fixed assets will not be revalued every year. But notional



-197 -                      ANNEX8
revalued fixed asset value have been calculated in order to set up tariffs under the rate of
return scenario.
33.   It is assumed that phase I of the project will be completed by end of year 2001,
and project phase II will start from year 2002 and finish at end of 2009. Since YRDPC is
accountable for construction, operations, and management of both project phases,
YRDPC's financial forecasts are prepared not only to include phase I but phase II's all
relevant financial assumptions including cost estimate and financing plans. Cost of
general main will be allocated to south and north main proportionally according to
planned water supply volume. Based on different project costs and financing plans,
tariffs for YRDP water supplied to Taiyuan and Datong (and Pingshao) can be
determined.
34.   Accounts payable is assumed to be one-month of cash operating costs.
35.   Tax payable include one-month tax and fees to be paid, plus current year's
income tax amount.
36.   Other payable is assumed to include 5 percent of accounts payable, interest on
local borrowing, and declared dividends, if any.
37.   Long-term debt: The forecast long-term debt includes the World Bank loan and
the Italian loan. The World Bank loan of $400 million is assumed to finance most
foreign currency component of the project cost. Terms for the World Bank loan are 20
years including a 5-year grace. Interest rate and commitment fee for the Bank loan are
assumed to be 6.13 percent and 0.25 percent, respectively. In addition, cofinancing loan
of $30 million will be used. Terms for Italian loan are 25 years including a 5-year grace;
interest rate is assumed at 6 percent annually. Debt repayment will start from year 2002;
therefore, beginning from year 2001, "current maturity of long-term loan" is shown on
the balance sheet and reclassified as a current liability.
38.   No local borrowings is assumed under the assumption that any shortage of funds,
after (1) World Bank loan, (2) cofinancing loan, (3) power revenue from Wanjiazhai Dam
(investment income since 1999), and (4) cumulatively available GSP surcharges, will be
resolved by additional governmental support (marked as additional surcharges under the
cash flow statement).
39.   Capital surplus refers to the cumulated surcharges on coal, electricity and water
appropriated from government. It is assumed that surcharges will be used to finance
phase I investments before 2002 and to support phase II afterwards. It is also assumed
that collection and use of surcharges cannot exceed a particular year's capital
requirements. GSP surcharges are not to be used in debt repayment.
40.   Earned surplus refers to cumulated employee welfare fund and development
fund which allocated from each year's net income per legal requirements.



-198 -                         ANNEX8
41.   Retained earnings are undesignated cumulated profits from operations which can
be used in debt repayment, future capital investments, rehabilitation work, or even
dividend to shareholders, if any.
Funds Flow Statement
42.   Debt service coverage ratio is computed according to the following formula:
(Net Income After Taxes + Interest on Long-Term Debt + Depreciation) / (Principal Repayment + Interest Expense)
43.   Rate of return on notionally revalued fixed assets is calculated using the
following formula:
(Net Operating Income) / (Average of Beginning and Ending Balances of Notionally Revalued Fixed Assets
in Service)
44.   GSP Surcharges
(a)    Coal /a
Current levies on coal sales by provincial finance bureau to fund
Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project are as below:
crude coal:   Y 2 per ton sold /b
washed coal: Y 3 per ton sold
charcoal:     Y 4 per ton sold
Additional surcharge of Y 0.5 per ton coal sales has been approved and
was effective from year 1996.
/a Duplicate levies are avoided, i.e., only one kind of surcharge is levied in
the coal processing cycle. Provincial Finance Bureau is conceiving to
impose duplicate levies and has submitted a proposal for government
approval. It is estimated that roughly additional Y 70 million can be
collected each year if this policy becomes effective, but this is not
included in the current financial forecasts.
/b VAT of 13 percent and other surcharges like educational fees are
included.   VAT  and fees will not be used to  finance  YRDP
construction, so available GSP surcharge from coal sales will be lesser
than Y 2 per ton.
(b)    Electricity:    Electricity  consumption  by  domestic  and  irrigation
consumption is imposed at 0.57 fen/kWh as YRDP funds. Electricity
consumption in other sectors within Shanxi province is imposed at 1.5 fen/
kWh. VAT and other fees are included, so effective rates are 0.4787 fen/
kWh and 1.26 fen/kWh respectively.



-199 -                     ANNEX8
Levy on outbound electricity sales has been proposed by Shanxi provincial
government and is very likely to materialize.  In current financial
projections, it is assumed that surcharge of 1.5 fen/kWh will be imposed
on outbound electricity sales starting from year 1998.
(c)   Water: The following are surcharge rates for water consumption in 1994
in different cities.
Y 0.25 (per ton of water consumption) in Taiyuan City
Y 0.2 in Datong
Y 0.1 in Yangguan
Y 0.05 in Changzhi
45.   Collection channels.  Surcharges on coal are collected by coal mines, coal
transport stations, and highway polling stations. Local or County Tax Bureaus are
responsible for turning over these surcharges to provincial finance bureau. Electricity
surcharge is collected by provincial power bureau who then submits collections to
provincial finance bureau. Water consumption surcharge is collected by municipal water
supply companies. Municipal finance departments are responsible for turning over this
surcharge to provincial finance bureau.
46.   Past and Future Collections. GSP surcharges are deposited in a special account.
Up to end of 1995, cumulative collection amounted to Y 2 billion; in which Y 1.6 billion
or so has been appropriated to YRDPC for project use. YRDPC and provincial finance
bureau have jointly estimated that surcharge collection will increase from Y 1 billion in
1996 (including additional surcharge of Y 0.5 on coal) to Y 1.2 billion in year 2001,
based on an assumed collection rate of 96.8 percent.
47.   Surcharge Assumptions in Financial Forecasts.  In YRDPC's financial
forecasts, it is assumed that GSP surcharges will be used to finance the proposed project
before end of 2001 and then the project phase II between 2002 and 2009. It is also
assumed that the World Bank loans, cofinancing loan, and investment income from
Wanjiazhai Dam, if available, are to be used prior to use of GSP surcharges. Therefore,
any excess of available funding in a particular year over that year's capital needs will be
considered to be GSP surcharges and be deferred to the following years. GSP surcharges
are not assumed to be used in debt repayment as the debt repayment factor has been taken
into account when determining market-driven water tariffs. Although GSP surcharges
may continue to be collected after the project completion, alleged by leaders of Shanxi
province, no income or capital increase in this regard has been assumed in YRDPC's
financial forecasts after 2010. In other words, no capital requirement, no GSP surcharge
allocation to YRDPC despite its availability.
Reporting Basis and Accounting Standards
48.   As an entity in charge of YRDP construction work, YRDPC currently adopts the
Accounting Standards for Construction Entities to prepare balance sheet and some



- 200 -                    ANNEX 8
supplementary statements. After project completion, YRDPC is to manage day-to-day
operations and will follow Accounting Standards for Operating Entities to prepare not
only balance sheets but also income statements and funds flow statements. At present,
YRDPC's financial reports are prepared in different combination scopes.
49.   The first kind of balance sheet and supplementary information presents YRDPC's
receipts of GSP surcharges provincial finance bureau and applications of such funds on
the project and Wanjiazhai dam.
50.   The second kind is a combined balance sheet for the project from ten independent
accounting units' balance sheets, excluding financial information for Wanjiazhai dam.
Ten accounting entities are headquarters construction division, headquarters institutional
division, Pianquan division, Pinglu division, Shanyang division, Ningwu division, post
administrative station, Taiyuan division, power supply division, and communication
division.
51.   The third kind of balance sheet is prepared by Wanjiazhai Project Bureau for the
dam component. As the dam is jointly invested by MWR, YRDPC, and Inner Mongolia,
the forth kind of balance sheet is prepared in a way to present only YRDPB's
investments.
52.   Then, for project monitoring, YRDP headquarters combines the forth and the
second kinds of balance sheet to produce the fifth kind of combined financial statement
which gives an overall project investment picture.
53.  In sum, to obtain a comprehensive financial report for YRDPC as a whole, the
fifth kind of reports should be consolidated with the first kind of report as the latter
includes the Bureau's available cash yet to be appropriated to the subordinate entities.
Unfortunately, no such a report has been prepared at present despite existence of various
individual and combined reports. Thus, YRDPC's balance sheet for the past four years
(1992-95) presented in Annex 8 is prepared following the above-mentioned principle.
B. TMWC
Pricing Methodology
54.   Water tariffs supplied by TMWC to end users are projected by following steps
similar to those described above for YRDPC:
(a) obtaining annual capital requirements;
(b) determining financing plans;
(c) calculating total project cost;
d) obtaining and validating necessary operational and financial assumptions for
both groundwater supply and purchased water treatment and supply;
e) setting up water tariffs based on a minimum debt coverage ratio of 1.2 or a
minimum rate of return on fixed assets in service of 2 percent, whichever



- 201-                     ANNEX8
gives a greater tariff, to make TMWC financially sustainable and provide
assurance of cost recovery and debt repayment.
55.   A summary table for above (a) to (c) is listed below.
Phase 1 (1997-2000)            Phase 11 (2005-2010)
TMWC          Huyan water treatment plant Phase I Huyan phase 11 (1.76 million mi3
(1 million m3/day), municipal distri- day) (unit 5 and 6 during 2005-07
bution/transmission pipelines  and unit 7 during 2008-10)
Capital Needs  Y 2.549 billion (estimate provided by Y1.941 billion (estimate based on
TMWC)                          phase I cost, inflation factor
considered)
Financing Plan Funding from Provincial and Munici- TMWC internal cash generation,
pal government, TMWC internal    Provincial surcharges on coal and
cash generation, incremental water  electricity sales
revenue from water tariff adjust-
ments, Japanese OECF loans
56.   To finance the Huyan water treatment plant and transmission/distribution
pipelines, Taiyuan municipality expected that a total of Y 900 million would be financed
by allocated funds from provincial and municipal governments, and the remaining capital
needs would be met by borrowing Japanese OECF loans. However, only Y 466 million
during the construction period is considered likely to materialize, which includes
(1) capital investment project funds from the municipal planning commission for Y 16
million per year, (2) the urban construction and maintenance tax from the urban
construction commission for Y 24 million per year, (3) the local surcharge on water
consumption for Y 11 million per year, (4) the water resource charge of Y 8 million per
year, and (5) allocated funds from the provincial government for Y 230 million in four
years. The shortage of Y 434, thus, is assumed to be funded by TMWC's internal cash
generation (its cumulated retained earnings), and additional water revenues as a result of
water tariff adjustments. The Japanese OECF loan is assumed to have a term of 22 years
including a 5-year grace period, and an interest rate of 4.35 percent.
Assumptions to Financial Projections
General Assumptions
57.   1995 actual financial statements are used as base for TMWC's financial forecasts.
1996 price is used as a reference when projecting cost and expenses. The following
domestic and international inflation are currently adopted by the Bank and used in
making projections:
1997  1998  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005
Domestic           6.2   5.8   5.5   5.5   5.5   5.5   5.5   5.5   5.5
International      1.7   2.2   2.5   2.5   2.5   2.5   2.5   2.5   2.5



- 202 -                    ANNEX 8
Income Statement Parameters
58.   Water purchase and sales volume:   Given current overextraction  of
groundwater, TMWC will reduce water supply volume each year, from 154 million ton
per year in year 1995 to estimated 117 million ton in year 2001. Since year 2002 when it
starts to purchase diverted water from YRDPC, TMWC will continue to reduce the
groundwater extraction slightly but supply more purchased water each year.  It is
assumed that water usage rate at Huyan treatment plant is 9.1 percent, and that
transmission and distribution loss is 6.34 percent for groundwater and 8 percent for raw
water.
59.   With respect to capacity expansion in order for Huyan water treatment plant to
receive increasing diverted water volume, it is assumed that phase II investment for
additional three units to increase capacity from 1 million m3/day to 1.76 million m3/day
will be made during 2005 and 2010.
60.   The following shows water volume of TMWC's groundwater extraction, diverted
water purchase, and supply to end users in several selected years:
2002  2004  2006  2008  2010
Groundwater supply                   117   114   113   112   111
Delivered water purchase at Huyan    273   356   420   514   596
Water Sales                          337   405   457   535   603
61.   Water Tariffs: Tariffs are driven by a minimum debt service ratio of 1.2 and a
minimum ROA of 2 percent as set out in financial covenants.
62.   Tax and fees: TMWC will need to pay value-added-tax (VAT) at 6 percent of
revenue net of VAT, and other tax and fees on top of VAT. Urban construction and
maintenance tax is levied at 7 percent of paid VAT, educational fees 3 percent, and
surcharge for price adjustment fund 2 percent. VAT will be collected by TMWC on
behalf of government and will not be shown on the forecast income statement. Projected
water tariffs on the income statement are net of VAT.
63.   Operating Costs: Operating costs consist of water purchase cost, personnel,
chemicals, power cost, repair and maintenance cost, depreciation, and other expense.
64.   For groundwater sales, operating costs are assumed to base on 1995 actual and to
escalate by 10 percent to 22 percent annually, and further fluctuate by estimated water
extraction volume.
65.   For treated raw water sales, operating costs are assumed as follows.
Unit water purchase cost is based on projected YRDPC's water tariffs.
Since year 2002, additional personnel cost of Y 7.3 million is assumed to incur
due to Huyan treatment plant's operations, new distribution pipelines, and



- 203 -                      ANNEX8
associated maintenance needed. Such personnel cost will escalate with local
inflation rates.
Chemical cost for diverted water is estimated at Y 70.3 per 1,000 m3 water
production and will escalate by inflation rates.
Power cost for diverted water sales is derived from a power consumption rate of
0.14 kWh/1,000 m3 water production and the market power tariff of 32 fen/kWh
in 1996 and will escalate with the local inflation rates.
Repair and maintenance cost for the new capital investments is assumed to be 2.9
percent of the new fixed assets cost (Huyan water treatment plant and distribution
pipelines).
Straight-line method is used in deriving depreciation. Annual depreciation is
provided at 7 percent of existing fixed asset plus 4.5 percent of new assets.
Other expenses is estimated to be 10 percent of above-mentioned estimated
expenses exclusive of depreciation.
66.   Interest: Interest during construction will be capitalized into project cost. After
project completion, interest will be recognized as current expense. Interest on foreign
loans will be financed locally and paid off in the current year.
67.   Income tax is assumed to be 33 percent of income before income tax.
68.   Appropriation of net income: Net income is assumed to be appropriated as
follows: (1) submission of GSP fund to municipal finance department which will turn it
to the provincial finance department for YRDP project use (GSP fund from water sector
will cease at end of year 1998), (2) welfare fund and development fund per legal
requirements, which account for 15 percent of net income; (3) dividends, if any; (4)
increase in retained earmings.
Balance Sheet Parameters
69.   Cash: During Huyan phase I construction period (1997-2000), no significant
cash increase is anticipated. Starting from year 2001, cash appears to cumulate because
(1) capital expenditure and transmission/distribution expansion programs are not fully
reflected in the projections, (2) TMWC has to meet minimum financial requirement such
as debt service ratio of 1.2 since 2002, and (3) TMWC needs to build up its capability to
partially self-finance the Huyan phase II investment.
70.   Accounts receivable is assumed to be 4.17 percent of current year revenue, or a
turnover rate of 24 per year.
71.   Inventory is assumed to be maintained at one month's chemical cost plus two
months' repair and maintenance cost.
72.   Long-term investment is assumed to maintain unchanged since 1995.



- 204 -                      ANNEX 8
73.   Fixed asset cost is cumulated and transferred from work-in-progress cost, which
includes capital investment cost, interest during construction, and foreign exchange
gain/loss. Fixed assets will not be revalued every year. But notional revalued fixed asset
value have been calculated in order to set up tariffs under the rate-of-return-on-assets
(ROA) scenario.
74.   Accounts payable is assumed to be one-month's cash operating costs.
75.   Tax payable include one-month VAT and tax and fees to be paid, plus current
year's income tax amount.
76.   Other payable is assumed to decrease each year by 5 percent since 1995.
77.   Long-term loans are assumed according to TMWC's plan to borrow Japanese
OECF loan of around Y 1.85 billion to fulfill capital requirements for Huyan water
treatment plant phase I investment and municipal water distribution system. The length
of OECF loan is assumed to be 22 years including a 5-year grace. Annual interest rate is
assumed to be 4.35 percent. No local borrowing is assumed because capital requirements
exceeding OECF loan amount will be funded by (1) TMWC's internal cash generation,
(2) budget allocation from both provincial and municipal governments, and (3)
incremental water revenue as a result of the proposed water tariff adjustment.
78.   Capital represents actual funds allocated from government as of end of 1995. As
no share capital is anticipated in short term, this balance is assumed to be unchanged for
the forecast period. Any government fund allocation will then treated as an increase in
capital surplus (like a donation) under generally accepted accounting principles.
79.   Capital surplus increases upon (1) receipt of allocated budget from provincial
and municipal governments to finance Huyan water treatment plant's phase I
construction, and (2) receipt of connection charge paid by new applicants.
80.   Earned surplus refers to cumulated employee welfare fund and development
fund which allocated from each year's net income per legal requirements.
81.   Retained earnings are undesignated cumulated profits from operations which can
be used in debt repayment, future capital investments, rehabilitation work, or even
dividend to shareholders, if any.
82.   Debt service coverage ratio is computed as follows.
(Net Income After Tax + Interest on Long-Term Debt + Depreciation) / (Principal Repayment + Interest Expense)
83.   Rate of return on notionally revalued fixed assets is calculated as follows.
(Net Operating Income) / (Average of Beginning and Ending Balances of Notionally Revalued Fixed Assets
in Service)

ANNEX 11: WATER SECTOR INSTITUTIONAL REFORM
1.    The Yellow River Diversion Project (YRDP) has significant effect on the economic
development of the Shanxi Province. When completed, the water shortage will be
significantly reduced. In order to ensure the rational development and utilization of the
water resources within the area and to fully exploit the project benefits, it is necessary to
reform the existing water institutions in the Yellow River water supply area.
Guidelines of Establishing New System
2.    The guidelines for establishing a new system in the Yellow River water supply area
will follow the principles:
(a)   Water resource allocation will be based on economic needs.
(b)   Water pricing system will be reformed for industry, agriculture and domestic
use.
3.    The center of the management reform is to free the water resource operations units
from government control and to transform them into independent corporations. These
corporations would carry out their own accounting and assume responsibilities for losses
and profits and finance development from loans they borrow.
4.    The reform will integrate operation of water resource management at all levels. The
main water resource institutions to be corporatized are: YRDP; Fen-1 Reservoir Co. Ltd.;
Fen-2 Reservoir Co. Ltd.; and Taiyuan Municipal Water Company, who will be responsible
for supplying water to users.
5.    Irrigation districts at county, township and village levels would be corporatized.
Main irrigation systems that are presently owned by Government will be sold to the private
sector through auctions. Farmers will be encouraged to buy shares to raise funds. Farmers'
representatives will be on the water company board. Farmers will be involved in decision-
making and managing the water supply corporations. The water units will be allowed to
sell their water saved through water conservation measures to industrial and domestic users.
Proposed Reform in the Yellow River Water Supply Area
6.    The reform is planned to be carried out in two steps.



- 229 -                     ANNEX 11
(a)   Changing the Present Governmental Water Supply Organizations into
Companies
(i)   The YRDP Management Office will be reorganized and transformed
into the Yellow River Water Enterprise Company Ltd.  The
corporation will use the water resource compensation fee of the
provincial government as state shares.
(ii)    The Fen River I Reservoir Management Bureau will be reorganized
to form the Fen River 1 Reservoir Co. Ltd. The company will use its
assets as collateral to borrow funds for rehabilitation and extension
of the Fen River 1 Reservoir after the YRDP water is diverted into
the reservoir. The main functions of the company are to regulate
Yellow River water and to sell this water to downstream industrial
and mining enterprises, to Fen-2 Reservoir, and to Taiyuan
Municipal Water Company. The company will also have revenues
from power generation, tourism, etc.
(iii)   Fen-2 Reservoir Water Enterprise Company Ltd. will be a new
company set up after completion of the construction of the Fen-2
dam. The main functions of this company are to regulate local water
from Fen-1 Reservoir, the local runoff between the Fen-1 and the
Fen-2 dams, and to sell water to the Fen River Irrigation District, and
industrial and mining enterprises, in emergency periods and special
years. The water from this reservoir will be used as reserve water.
The company also has the functions of power generation and
tourism.
(iv)    The present Fen River Water Conservancy Management Bureau will
be reformed into Fen River Water Enterprise Corporation. Its main
functions are to sell water to farmers' managed irrigation districts,
industrial and mining enterprises, as well as township enterprises.
The company also has the functions of flood plain development and
real estate development.
(v)    Taiyuan Municipal Water Company will be reformed into Taiyuan
Municipal Water Supply Company Ltd. When the company is set
up, the investments from the Taiyuan Municipal Government and
the Shanxi Provincial Government, together with its original
properties will be sold as shares to the public. In addition, water
resources development foundation will be set up to extensively
absorb the scattered funds from the individuals and the society to
accumulate funds as shares. The main functions of this company are
to supply water to Taiyuan's industrial and mining enterprises and
productive management units and domestic water users.



- 230 -                     ANNEX 11
(vi)    The existing Taiyuan Sewage Treatment Plant will be converted into
Taiyuan Sewage Treatment Company Ltd. The main functions are
to treat the domestic sewage water and wastewater discharged by
industrial and mining enterprises and reuse the treated water for
agricultural and industrial uses and to meet a part of water demand
for municipal uses.
Each company will set up a shareholder's congress, board of directors,
supervision commissions. Each company will have its own administrative
offices, public relation department, financial department and others will be
set up.
These companies will be established according to the "Company Law of
China" and the relevant regulations, and the company will assume their
losses and profits.
The Self-Supply Tubewell Commission (SSTC) will be set up and have an
operation center responsible for the management, coordination, supervision
and control of the business operation of the scattered tubewells. SSTC will
control overdraft of groundwater and will establish clear guidelines of
groundwater extraction.
A water management conmmission will be established as a water regulator in
the supply area, which will consist of representatives of relevant
governmental departments and legal representatives of corporations. The
main functions are as follows:
(i)    To coordinate the allocation of water to industrial, domestic and
agricultural users of different corporations based on the inflow
conditions and water demands in different years to achieve optimal
water distribution;
(ii)    To coordinate the transaction costs and water charges of different
water supply companies;
(iii)    To organize trading of water among corporations and to promote
greater reuse of water.
The Water Commission will set up the executive office and will have the
regulatory functions for water resource planning, water allocation, water
price adjustment and monitoring of surface and groundwater resources.
(b)   Establishing a Group Corporation System. The second stage of the
reform will be the setting up of a group water corporation of all the suppliers
of water (YRDP, Fen-1, Fen-2, Fen Irrigation Bureaus, and SSTC). This
corporation is essentially a river basin authority whose main functions are to



- 231-                     ANNEX 11
manage the water resources within the Upper Fen Basin. The authority will
be responsible for both surface and groundwater.
7.    The autonomy and other legal rights of companies will be protected by the
Company Law of China and its accompanying regulations. The companies are subject to
jurisdiction of Water Law of China and its accompanying regulations.
8.    The water corporations will be required to compile and implement water supply
plans in accordance with the approved comprehensive water resources development plans.
The water supply plan should take into consideration of the following: (a) flood control and
river protection requirements; (b) allocation of water to industrial, municipal and irrigation
uses and environmental needs; and (c) water extraction should be no more than the quotas
specified in their water permits.
9.    Sanctions should be imposed to those, who destroy water conservancy projects and
damage of water resource facilities by the legal departments of the governments.
10.   To protect the groundwater resources, the groundwater extraction fee will be raised
to comparable levels as surface water.
11.   Government permission will be required to shift irrigation water to industrial and
domestic users. Extra fees are to be collected from those users to compensate the farmers in
monetary forms. The rational trading of water between domestic and industrial users will
be approved by the Government.
12.  In the operation of companies, the Government will continue to support and help the
companies to resolve issues between different water units.
Procedures of Implementation
13.   The institutional reform of water management system will be implemented in three
stages:
(a)   By the year 2000, the grassroots water supply units at county, township and
village levels in Yellow River water supply area will be reformed to be
companies;
(b)   Before the year 2001, the water supply units in Taiyuan urban area will be
autonomous under a river basin corporation (Upper Fen Basin Corporation);
(c)   By the time the North Main is brought into operation, all the water supply
units will be turned into companies.
14.   The first-stage reform commenced in October 1996 and the following will be
implemented starting 1997:



- 232 -                     ANNEX 11
(a)   In June 1997, a reform preparation and leading panel will be set up under the
leadership of the provincial government, concerned planning report will be
submitted to the World Bank.
(b)   In March 1998, the pilot water supply corporations will be established at the
county, township and village levels.
(c)   In August 1998, a research report on water pricing system will be submitted
a new policy of water pricing will be issued.
(d)   By 1998, a report of the research program for the corporatization of the
water supply units will be completed and the execution of the reform will be
commenced.
(e)   By 2000, the study of optimal dispatching of various water resources
considering Yellow River diverted by YRDP through simulation will be
completed. The water supply units at county, township and village levels
will be brought into corporation frame.
15.   The second-stage reform will be:
(a)   In 2001, the water supply at county, township and village levels will be
brought within the river basin corporation.  The corporation will be
publicized one year before the corporation is formed.
(b)   In 2001, a water resource monitoring system will be established.

ANNEX 12: PROPOSED MONITORING INDICATORS
PROJECT MONITORING
1.    The effectiveness of project implementation in terms of alleviating water supply
bottlenecks of Taiyuan City will be measured by reference to a number of monitoring
indicators. The specific project objectives and the associated monitoring indicators are
listed in Table 1. Each indicator requires a baseline level against which the effectiveness
of the project in achieving the design objectives can be measured. Shanxi Government
and YRDPC obtained the necessary baseline data (as of July 1996) and developed the
necessary methodologies for monitoring.
2.    The achievement of project output will be monitored by CPM/PERT charts

ANNEX 15: ADMINISTRATION OF THE POLLUTION
SUBLOANS
Purpose of the Subloans
1.    WWTP/Phase I Components. The WWTP/Phase I comprises two types of
action (a) delivery of the imported water to Taiyuan and (b) optimal use of the expensive
imported water along with the existing local water, so as to minimize water use wastage
and to minimize and control environmental degradation in Taiyuan service area.
2.    Need for the Subloan Facility. In order to achieve the target of above item (b), it
is important to carried out comprehensive water pollution control especially industrial
pollution control (which is the major pollution source in Taiyuan City). However,
Taiyuan has been seriously short of funds for financing such works. During 1991 to 1995,
total annual investment was Y 618 million, averaging about Y 124 million per year,
compared with an estimated annual need of about Y 299 million. One measure that is
known to be very useful for helping fill this gap is use of a special revolving fund for
offering attractive low-service-charge loans to industries to encourage them to move
ahead using their own initiative and financing sources for planning/implementing needed
waste management program including recycling, reuse, and use of Clean Technologies,
including furnishing of technical assistance by TEPB to help industries plan cost-
effective programs with minimum or even negligible risks.
3.    Purpose of the Subloan Facility. A Pollution Control Subloan Facility totaling
$8.0 million was therefore proposed by Taiyuan EPB under this project for the
introduction of new pollution prevention technology. The purpose of the Facility is for
financing industrial enterprises in Taiyuan City to adopt Clean Technologies to reduce
and control their pollution to protect and improve the Fen River water quality and the
environment of Taiyuan.
Subloan Sources
4.    The local counterpart fund will come mainly from the special environment
protection investment from Shanxi Provincial and Taiyuan City Governments as well as
from enterprises' self-raised fund.
Subloan Management
5.   Institutional Frame. To effectively manage the Subloan, Taiyuan is to establish
a special body, the Subloan Administration Technical Committee (SATC), and an
executive agency, the Subloan Management Office (SMO), which are patterned after the



- 239 -                    ANNEX 15
experience of Tianjin, which is also a major industrial center with problems of waste
management similar to these at Taiyuan.
6.    Figure 1 shows the operation framework for the Subloan management. The
normal operation involves various agencies including (a) Candidate Enterprises
(Applicants for Fund), (b) Government Agencies, (c) Subloan Management Office
(SMO), and (d) Subloan Administration Technical Committee (SATC). The key
components in fund management agencies are the SATC and the SMO.
7.    The Subloan Administration Committee (SATC) is in charge of Fund
management which comprises representatives of concerned government agencies
including TEPB, Taiyuan Planning Commission, and Taiyuan Finance Bureau with
TEPB at leading position. The major duties for Fund Board include:
(a)   Prepare directives and regulations for Fund use
(b)   Finance Bureau will set up an account for the fund
(c)   Set up loan approval conditions
(d)   Set up the SMO
(e)   Approval of SMO annual work plan
(f)   Approval of Subloan projects
(g)   Review of SMO annual report
8.    The SMO is an executive agency of the Fund Board. The members of the SMO
include a Director (Environmental Engineer), an economist, a finance expert, an
accountant and an office staff. The duties of the SMO include:
(a) Proposal for annual budget plan
(b) Appraisal of proposed projects
(c) Technical assistance to project enterprises
(d) Fund lending and recovering
(e) Annual reports, stage reports and other reports to Fund Board
9.    The Finance Bureau and Taiyuan Planing Commission are the key government
agencies responsible for the Subloan and TEPB will be the lead agency of the SATC.
Together with related government agencies, TEPB is responsible for the establishment of
the SATC Board and the SMO. Another important role of the TEPB is to solve, with
cooperation from other government agencies and support from City Government, any
problems in the operation of the Fund which are beyond the capabilities of the Fund
Board.
10.   The TEPB is considered to have a good background of experience for establishing
and maintaining the proposed fund. TEPB has already carried out preliminary efforts in



- 240 -                     ANNEX 15
this field, including arranging for use of a fund of some Y 76 million over the period
1991-95. This included establishment of good working relationships with the Taiyuan
Finance Bureau and with industrial management bureaus of Taiyuan City, including
experience on project selection, project establishment, project review, and project
acceptance, and including development of appropriate capabilities in TEPB on related
managerial and financial analysis tasks.
11.   The Related Government Agencies other than TEPB are those City Government
Agencies responsible for planning and financing of industrial development and the
agencies of management authorities of different enterprises. Their functions include:
(a)   Participation in the Fund Board
(b)   Appraisal and permission of enterprises' proposals
(c)   Cooperation with TEPB in solving problems in Fund operation
12.   Fund Operation Procedure. As shown in Figure 1, initial proposals are to be
made by candidate enterprises and submitted to responsible government agencies for
review and permission. Then, formal proposals are submitted to the SMO for appraisal
with the criteria discussed below.
13.   Procedures for Processing Subloans.  The SMO with the use of local
consultants will be responsible for processing the subloans. The enterprises will prepare
an initial feasibility study which will be reviewed in detail by the SMO. The SMO will
appraise the proposals and submit the appraisal to the SATC for final approval. Prior
Bank review will only be needed for the first 3 subprojects and subsequent subprojects
over $1.0 million.
Criteria for selection of Candidate Enterprises
14.   Subborrower Eligibility Criteria. The subborrower must be in the following
types of industries: steel, chemicals including fertilizer, paper mills or pharmaceuticals.
Under the circumstances a loan will be made available under a first come/first serve basis
to industry who could meet the following criteria and subproject eligibility criteria: (a) is
a limited liability (shareholding) company or otherwise established as a legal entity; (b)
has a completed EIA approved by the TEPB and has a mitigation plan satisfactory to the
Bank; (c) has adopted the new accounting standards and its financial statements have
been audited by independent auditors; and (d) the company has been appraised and found
creditworthy by China Merchant Bank or Agriculture Bank of China.
15.   Subproject Eligibility Criteria. A grading points system is suggested by TEPB
with the mission for selection of Candidate Enterprises for loans from the Fund. The
system as shown in Table 2 assigns points to various criteria (12 items) according to their
relative importance and priority. The Fund Management Board will meet from time-to-
time to select the appropriate subprojects according to the criteria laid out.



-241-                      ANNEX 15
16.   Terms of the Subloan. The subloan terms will be as follows:
Interest Rate and Fees. Subborrowers will pay a commitment fee of 0.75 percent
on the undisbursed amount of the subloan. The minimum interest margin will be
2 percent over the Bank interest rate but could vary depending on the cost of
undertaking the required appraisal and loan processing, administrative overheads
for the SMO and repayment risk.
Maturity. The maturity of individual subloans will be no more than three years
grace and 8 years repayment period.
Rate of Return. Each subproject financed will have a financial rate and an
economic rate of return of no less than 11 percent.
17.   Conditions of Subloans. The maximum size of a loan cannot exceed $ 1.5
million. The costs of the subloan are mainly for pollution control equipment and services
and must not include the costs of civil works, taxes, or land.
18.   Procurement Procedures. All equipment contracts above $ 0.75 million will be
procured using ICB procedures, and between $ 0.3 and $ 0.75 million will be NCB
procedures. Items costing less than $ 0.3 million will be procured using shopping
procedures using three quotations. The accumulated total under shopping procedures will
not exceed $ 2.0 million.
Bank Loan Repayment
19.   The existing loan repay channels for fund operation being carried out by TEPB
are to be used. The World Bank Loan of $ 8.0 million will be returned annually with
same amount by Pollution Control Subsidy Fund coming from the overindex pollution
discharge fees which are collected by TEPB.

ANNEX 16: IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT ON
THE YELLOW RIVER BASIN
1.    The project would be a major water-consuming project in the mid-reach of the
Yellow River Basin. At full operation, it would divert about 2 percent of average annual
flow, and about 2.5 percent of a relatively dry year's flow. Much of this water will
therefore be unavailable to other users in the Basin, and its loss could have environmental
effects.
2.    The Yellow River is China's second longest (after the Yangtze) at 5,464 km. It
originates in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, and passes through nine provinces before
emptying into the Bohai Sea. An agricultural population of about 130 million is
dependent on the river, and millions more urban residents rely on it for their supplies. In
the near future, Yellow River water will be diverted as far as Beijing to supply municipal
needs.
3.    Mean annual flow is about 56 billion m3, with a high degree of variation. In one
out of four years flow is 46 billion or less. Runoff is highly seasonal, with about 60
percent occurring in the summer months July to October. Interannual storage is provided
by Longyanxia reservoir located in the far upper reaches, with a usable storage of about
22 billion mi. At present, only Liujaxia (downstream of Longyanxia) with a live storage
of 3 billion m', and Sanmenxia, located at the start of the lower reach with a live storage
of less than 1 billion mi, provide significant intraannual storage. Numerous diversion
barrages/run-of-river power plants dot the river in its upper and middle reaches, with
more under construction.
4.    Throughout recorded history, the major problems associated with the Yellow
River are floods and silt. Floods have killed millions, and wreaked untold havoc on the
economy of the river's lower reach. The Yellow River is also the heaviest silt-laden river
in the world. Flood control dikes have kept the river from "wandering" in recent decades,
but have also helped trap large volumes of sediment, leading to the phenomenon of part
of the lower reach being suspended above the surrounding plain by as much as 10 meters.
Most of the sediment originates in the Loess Plateau adjacent to the middle reach, and
during the peak flow summer months. Local experts estimate that 20-24 billion m3 per
year are required to flush sediment to the sea and minimize further riverbed aggradation.
The river is often dry at the mouth in the Spring months, due to a combination of low
runoff, peak irrigation demands, and insufficient storage downstream.
5.    China has long had detailed plans for the control of the river and the use of its
water. These plans include the maintenance of dikes to minimize the impacts of floods,
the construction of dams to regulate floods and sediment and to redistribute water to meet



- 245 -                     ANNEX 16
seasonal demands and provide relief from droughts, and a water allocation scheme that
ensures economic development is balanced across sectors and water is equitably shared
among the nine provinces bordering the river.
6.    The project is one of the water supply projects included in the Yellow River Plan,
and has been sanctioned by the State Council. Other current projects include the Bank-
financed Xiaolangdi Dam, under construction downstream from Sanmenxia, which will
have about 12 billion m3 of storage to start, declining to about 5 after several years of
controlled siltation. It is primarily designed for flood control and silt management, but
will also generate substantial hydropower and permit improved water management for
lower-reach irrigation supplies and estuarial flows. With Xiaolangdi, flows at the mouth
can be theoretically maintained at a minimum of 30 m3/second, a level that can help
preserve the fish population and prevent other environmental degradations associated
with the mouth drying up. Xiaolangdi will be operational in about 1999. In addition,
Wanjiazhai Dam is under construction in the middle reach. It will have 0.9 billion m3 of
storage, generate power, and permit diversion of Yellow River water to mid-reach users
(including the project) before the river passes the Loess area and becomes silt-laden. One
or more dams are planned upstream of Xiaolangdi, which, if realized, will effectively
control all but flood flows. Also under consideration is the transfer of very large volumes
from the Yangtze River to the Yellow, for later use in the lower Yellow River Basin and
other water-short areas in northern China.
7.    The project begs several questions with regard to its potential impact on the
Yellow River Basin, in particular, the lower reach:
*  Will the project exacerbate the recurring problem of the Yellow River running
dry at its mouth?
*  Will the project reduce the volumes of water required to flush sediment from
the lower reach?
*  Will Shanxi Province remain within its allocation of Yellow River water after
the project?
*  Who among consumers of Yellow River water will suffer when the project
diverts water from other uses?
*  What are the economic opportunity costs of project diversions, and how do the
economic returns compare with other potential uses for diverted water?



- 246 -                      ANNEX 16
Methodology
8.    The problems of and plans for the Yellow River were investigated at some length
in a Bank report prepared in conjunction with the analysis of the Xiaolangdi Project.'"
That study used, as its primary tool of analysis, a nonlinear programming model of the
Basin's water supplies, demands, and constraining factors, including the need to generate
hydroelectric power, and manage water so as to minimize the impact of floods. The
model, called the Yellow River Basin Level Model (BLM) is used to simulate the variety
of potential impacts that the project diversions may have. The results of the model can be
expected to be robust with respect to states of nature because it is solved for all 56 years
of available hydrologic data (water inflow).
Estuarial Flows and Sediment Management
9.    Under present (1995) conditions of water demand, the BLM estimates that the
average annual flow at the estuary is 22 billion m3, and that the flow is about 13 billion
m3 in relatively dry years.'I The probability that the 20 billion mi3 minimum required for
sediment flushing can be met is 0.46. Furthermore, the model shows that the river is dry
at the mouth in 22 percent of months, most often in March, April and May when
irrigation demands peak. The results are shown in column (1) of Table 1. Clearly, the
current state of affairs is not satisfactory from an environmental perspective.
10.   Other things equal, in 2000 the probability of not having 20 billion m3 falls to
0.41 and the frequency of dry months increases to 28 percent solely due to the impact of
increasing water demands throughout the Basin, and increases in diversions to other areas
such as Beijing and Qingdao (Table 1, column 2). However, these simulations ignore the
regulating capabilities of Xiaolangdi and Wanjiazhai dams, which will be available about
2000. When these new facilities are taken into account, the results improve dramatically.
11.   In column (3) the storage facilities at Xiaolangdi and Wanjiazhai are added, and
Xiaolangdi operated to so as to provide a 30 m3/second flow at the mouth if possible
(30 m3/second = 0.08 billion m3/month). The minimum flow can be achieved in all
months of all simulated years, and the average flow rises to 21 billion m3.  The
probability of achieving the 20 billion m3 level rises to 43 percent, back where it was in
1995. Clearly, Xiaolangdi, if operated as intended, can significantly increase the water
available for sediment management (as it was designed to do) as well as provide
continual flows at the mouth.

12.   How will the project affect these results? The same simulations were made with
the project diversions, and the results are shown in column (4). As the bottom line
shows, the minimum flows at the mouth can again be met in every month of every year.
Obviously, the relatively small volumes diverted to the project will not eradicate the
ability of Xiaolangdi, located about 400 km downstream from the Wanjiazhai diversion
point, to manage estuarial flows. Furthermore, there are no significant differences in the
annual flows at the mouth. In most years, these flows decline by 240 milion m3, just
over 1 percent. This is because there are return flows from project water diverted to
Taiyuan via the Fen River. In general, returns from M&I diversions to the Fen River are
about 80 percent. Given the seasonality of irrigation demands, about half of returns are
usable by farmers, who have a typical efficiency of 50 percent. Thus, only 40 percent of
project diversions to Taiyuan will actually be consumed, and 60 percent will eventually
return to the Yellow River. The percentage will increase if and when Phase II of the
Project commences, because water diverted along the northern route will not return to the
Yellow.
13.   Clearly, there is not enough water in the Yellow River in most years to meet all
the future demands and provide the desired flow to fully manage sediment. But with
Xiaolangdi, the environmental problems, particularly those associated with lack of water
at the estuary, are mitigated, and Xiaolangdi both increases the volumes of water
available for sediment management, and vastly improves the efficiency of use of those
volumes. Project diversions neither alter the ability of Xiaolangdi to accomplish this, nor
significantly reduce the volumes of water available for it.
Project and Provincial Allocations
14.   Recognizing that water shortages in the Yellow River Basin were becoming
increasingly frequent, the State Council adopted in 1987 limits on diversions (gross



- 248 -                     ANNEX 16
consumption) for each of the nine provinces bordering the river. Including 2 billion m3
allocated for the Hebei-Beijing transfer, they total 37 billion m3, of which Shanxi's
allocated share is 4.31 billion m3. This limit only applies to that part of Shanxi that lies
within the Yellow River Basin, not to that lying within the Hai Basin, and not to
groundwater use.
15.   The question, then, is will the diversions from the project, which will eventually
reach 1.2 billion m3/year, keep Shanxi's use of Yellow River water less than 4.31 billion
mi3? To answer this, we must first estimate Shanxi's potential consumption of local
Yellow River water (mainly the Fen River and the Yellow tributaries flowing out of
Shanxi). These estimates were made with the use of the Provincial Planning Model
(PPM)]2 and are shown in the "consumption" line of Table 2. The numbers are not based
on any future planning scenario, but reflect what level of consumption is possible given
the seasonality of surface water availability, the limits of water storage availability, and
the efficiency of water conveyance structures.  In half of the years (PSO), 3.17
consumption is possible from nonproject sources, 2.95 is possible in dry years, and only
2.07 in very dry years.
16.   Comparing these levels of feasible consumption with the allocation, the table
shows that even at full operation (including the Phase II supplies to Datong and
Pingshuo), Shanxi will remain with the limit in all but the median year, and then only
exceed it by a small margin. However, the limits only apply in water years drier than
P50. In the P75 year, Shanxi comes close to reaching its limit, which is why the project
will undoubtedly be the last possible project that draws water from the Yellow River.

Project and Changes in Diversions
17.   With its offtake at Wanjiazhai Dam located in the upper middle reach, the project
begs the question of whether the water it takes will reduce diversions (and hence
consumption) to all areas downstream of it. The simple answer is no so long as water
12 "Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Background Study. Economics Volume." World Bank (September 1996).



- 249 -                     ANNEX 16
demands in the provinces upstream of Shanxi do not exceed their allocations. Above, we
saw that flows to the Sea decline by the volume of water consumed by the project (240
million m3/year at full development of Phase I, and 800 million m3/year when Phase II is
completed). The same simulations also showed that diversions to the downstream
provinces were unaffected by the project. This is because the model (as well as Chinese
water management policy) gives preference to water demands up to provincial allocation
limits so long as the economic returns from meeting those demands are positive.
Economic returns to downstream water use are sufficiently high (though not nearly as
high as those from project diversions) that any decrease in river flow will be taken from
flows to the Sea, not from consumptive uses.
18.   Only if the upstream provinces unlawfully exceed their allocation limits will
downstream water shortages appear, which may cause a direct conflict between Shanxi
and the downstream users. This situation is not likely to arise given (a) the close
monitoring of consumption of Yellow River water by the water authorities, and (b) the
limited upstream consumption capacity due to limited water storage and control facilities.
Indeed, the BLM showed that the upstream provinces would not exceed their allocations
even under the most optimistic development plans imagined for the year 2020.
Opportunity Costs of Project Diversions
19.   If the project will not reduce the water available to downstream users, then the
economic opportunity cost of the water diverted should be zero. The environmental
opportunity cost will always be positive, given that the consumed water will not be
available for sediment flushing, etc., but this number is exceedingly difficult to measure.
But it is entirely possible that future irrigation development downstream, or addition
schemes to transfer water out of the Basin may lead to lower-reach water shortages,
which cannot be met by curtailing flows to the sea. If this should occur, then the
economic opportunity cost will no longer be zero.
20.   To estimate what that cost might be, we again used the BLM, recognizing that the
residual water consumer will likely be irrigators in the downstream provinces of Henan
and Shandong. The BLM estimated that, under 2000 conditions of cropping patterns,
crop yields, and efficiency of water use, the marginal returns to downstream irrigators
would be Y 1.25/m3. Any reduction in their water supplies would therefore incur an
economic cost of Y 1 .25/m3. Since only 40 percent of water diverted to the project would
be consumed (lost), then the opportunity cost of diverting water to the project is 0.4*1.25
= Y 0.5/mi3. This cost is included in the economic analysis of Phase I of the Project. In
Phase II, the cost will increase to about Y 1I/m3 since a lower percentage of diverted water
will return.

ANNEX 17: DAM SAFETY AND EMERGENCY
PREPAREDNESS
A. DAM SAFETY
1.    Fen-l Dam. The dam was completed in 1961 for flood control, irrigation, water
supply and power generation. The homogeneous earthfill dam is 61.4m high, with total
storage capacity of 731 million m3 corresponding to Ei. 1130.2m. But the accumulated
volume of siltation reached 347 million m3 by October 1995. At present, the storage
capacity is reduced to 384 million m3. The monitoring data of more than 30 years show
that the performance behavior of the dam is in normal condition.
2.    The Fen-1 Reservoir will provide 120 million m 3 storage for the period when
pumping is not possible from Wanjiazhai Reservoir. In addition, it can also provide
supplementary supply about 40 to 110 million m 3 of water from Fenhe river basin
through optimized regulation for Haoshuigou, Fen-1 and Fen-2 Reservoirs. The intake
structure of the pipeline of the Connecting Works is located at the right abutment of Fen-
1 dam.
3.    The general layout of the dam, its main features, instrumentation, siltation and
other status have been described in a Preappraisal Report prepared by Mr. Zhao
Chuanshao in November 1995. The status of Dam Safety Inspection, Operation and
Maintenance Plan and Emergency Preparedness Plan are described below.
4.    Dam Safety Inspection. Since impoundment of reservoir, seepage around the
left abutment has been found, and remedial works were undertaken. Treatment had been
taken in 1964, 1973 and 1981. Because of siltation, the storage capacity of reservoir was
reduced significantly. For the purpose of ensuring dam safety against floods, the dam has
been heightened by 1.4m in 1978 and an additional outlet tunnel with diameter of 8m was
completed in May 1995. Each time before the implementation of rehabilitation, the ad
hoc Panel of Experts has been involved in safety inspection, design review and
construction supervision. In 1990, safety inspection was also carried out by the reservoir
management identification team led by MWR. As for the regular safety inspection, it has
not been organized yet.
5.    Based on the Operational Policies of the World Bank, it is required that Shanxi
Province will appoint an independent Panel of experts to carry out regularly the dam
safety inspection once every five years and will submit the Panel's reports to the Bank,
starting with the first report on October 31, 1998.

6.     The Terms of Reference for Fen-I Dam  Safety Inspection Panel is provided as
Attachment 1.
7.     Operation and Maintenance Plan. The Operation Plan for Flood Control is
prepared annually before the rainy season by Fen- 1 Reservoir Management Bureau and
then approved by Provincial Flood Protection Headquarters. The Plan includes the
general description, the siltation status of the reservoir, the performance behavior of the
dam and appurtenant structures, the flood regulating criteria and results, as well as
emergency preparedness measures.
8.     The Operation Plan for Water Supply which is separate from flood control, is also
prepared annually by Fen- I Reservoir Management Bureau based on the water inflow of
the previous year and approved by the Provincial Water Resources Department. In recent
years, the annual water supplies for irrigation, industry and municipality were about 150
and 40 million m3 respectively.
9.     Monitoring of instrumentation was carried out regularly. The frequencies of data
collection such as settlement, displacement, pore pressure, phreatic line, seepage etc.
were different depending upon the variation tendency derived from accumulated data of
previous years for different instruments. However, before and after flood season of each
year, a comprehensive and detailed data collection were thoroughly undertaken. During
major floods, the collection intervals were shortened. At the same time, visual inspections
were carried out in detail.
10.    Regular maintenance work has been implemented on a small scale. But after
completion of the dam, rehabilitation programs have been undertaken for several times.
The major programs, such as dam heightening and construction of an additional 8m outlet
tunnel, were designed by SIDI and approved by MWR.

12.   If an extremely large flood occurs and the pool level goes up to 1,130m,
emergency measures should be started according to order issued by Provincial Flood
Protection Headquarters (PFPH). The emergency task forces, including the army, public
utilities and farmers, will promptly arrive to the damsite to heighten urgently the dam by
constructing a small dike to the elevation 1, 1 34.3m. At the same time, the PFPH will call
for immediate evacuation of the downstream affected area.
13.  In case the pool level ups to 1,131m, the saddle dam on right bank would be
artificially broken, if necessary. The maximum discharge due to this artificial breaking
would be 83,500 m3/second. According to the result of flood routing, the maximum
discharge at Yingze Bridge, Taiyuan City would be 40,000 m3/second, much greater than
the allowable 3,450 m3/second.
14.   The Emergency Preparedness Plan has been preliminarily considered in the
Operation Plan for Flood Protection. But it seems not complete enough. It is suggested
that more detailed Emergency Preparedness Plan be proceeded, taking into account the
Guidelines for Emergency Preparedness Plan, provided as Attachment 3.
15.   Wanjiazhai Dam. The Wanjiazhai Dam is located on the main stem of the
Yellow River in the middle reach, 30 km northwest of Pianguan County, Shanxi
Province. The dam is of concrete gravity type, 105m high, with the total storage and
regulating capacity of 896 and 445 million m3 respectively. The two intakes for the
YRDP are set up in the dam near the left abutment.
16.   The dam is not under the Yellow River Diversion Project, but is being constructed
by MWR. By the end of 1995, 256,000 m3 of concrete have been placed in the dam body.
According to the schedule, 500,000 m3 of concrete will be placed in 1996. It is planned
that the dam will be completed by the end of 1998.
17.   Detailed description of the dam was given in "Current Status of Design and
Construction of Wanjiazhai Water Project on Yellow River" prepared by Messrs. Zhang
Zezhen and Chen Yiming on September 30, 1995. The Dam Safety Inspection, Operation
and Maintenance Plan and Emergency Preparedness Plan are discussed below.
18.   Dam Safety Inspection. The design of the dam is prepared by TIDI. It has been
reviewed by China International Engineering Consultative Corporation in 1990 and by
General Planning and Design Institute, MWR in 1993 and 1995. A special team of
experts has visited the damsite providing consultancy on the design in October 1991. Up
to now, no permanent Panel of Experts has been set up.
19.   Through Local Competitive Bidding, the contracts of the dam and the hydropower
plant were awarded to the 4th and 6th Construction Bureaus of Hydro and Hydropower
respectively. The Northeast Hydro and Hydropower Investigation and Design Institute
undertakes the construction supervision, acting as Engineer.



- 253 -                     ANNEX 17
20.   Taking into account the importance of the dam project and also based on the
operational policies of the World Bank, it is recommended that the Dam Safety
Inspection Panel will be organized by MWR to undertake periodic, comprehensive and
independent review to evaluate features and actions pertaining to the safety of the dam
and appurtenant structures during the course of construction and operation. For the
purpose of satisfactory implementation, the Terms of Reference for Wanjiazhai Dam
Safety Inspection Panel is provided as Attachment 2.
21.   Operation and Maintenance Plan. Due to the high silt content of Yellow River
during flood season, the basic criterion of the operation program of the reservoir involves
impounding the clear water and discharging the muddy water. Each year in August and
September, the pool level will usually be lowered to 952-957 m for flushing the sediment.
From mid July to mid October, the pool level should not be higher than 966 m for
maintaining the storage capacity of flood regulation.   The highest pool level
corresponding to 1: 10,000 years flood would be 979.1 m.
22.   The impoundment of the reservoir will be started in mid-October.  From
November to February of next year, the pool level shall be maintained at 975 m or lower
for ice control, because this is the period of ice flowing before freezing-up. From the
beginning of March to the beginning of April, the pool level shall be lowered to 970 m
for melting ice control. After that time, the pool level can be raised to 980 m.
23.   The above mentioned operation program  is stipulated in principle in the
preliminary design. The maintenance program has not been prepared yet. It is suggested
that the Operation and Maintenance Plan should be prepared before initial reservoir
filling, generally in conformity with the guidelines given in Attachment 4.
24.   Emergency Preparedness Plan. According to the preliminary design, the results
of flood regulation are as follows:
Probability   Flood Peak      Highest Pool    Correspondin      Maximum
Discharge         Level          g Storage        Outflow
Discharge
%           m3/sec            m             million m3        m3/sec
0.2          15,100           973.56            166            7,624
0.1          16,500           974.99           200             7,784
0.02          19,800          977.79            269             8,086
0.01         21,200            979.1            302             8,221
25.   During discussion, TIDI considered that there are following favorable conditions
preventing the failure of the dam:



- 254 -                    ANNEX 17
(a)   The dam is built on sound and thick limestone foundation without
developed geotechnical structures, and is located in the region of low
seismic intensity (six degree).
(b)   The results of flood regulation did not include the service of the surface
spillway, which will be operated as extraordinary measure with additional
discharge capacity of 864 m3/second.
(c)   In case of emergency, the pool level can be drawn down from 977m to
915m in five days with the help of large discharge capacity of medium and
bottom outlet works.
(d)   The crest elevation of the concrete gravity dam is 982m, with the
freeboard of 2.9m above highest flood pool level. Even the extremely big
flood should occur, the sustainability of the gravity dam against
overtopping would be considerable.
26.   TIDI has examined the effects of a check flood of 1 in 10,000 years, however,
they have not examined the effect of the PMF type flood and dam failure caused by
nuclear attack.
27.   As for the instrumentation and monitoring system, flood forecasting and
communication system, and other facilities which are closely related to safety of regular
operation and in case of emergency, have been designed.
28.   Downstream of the dam, the existing Tianqiao hydropower station is located 110
km from Wanjiazhai, and also some villages, townships exist on small flood plains in
Yellow River tributaries. The Tianqiao hydropower station is composed of 190m long
concrete gravity dam on the left bank and 330m long earthfill dam on the right bank. The
heights of the concrete and earthfill dams are 42 and 23m respectively. While the storage
capacity of the reservoir is 66 million m3, and the installed generating capacity is 128
MW. The maximum discharge capacity of spillway is 17,010 m3/second corresponding to
the probability of 0.2 percent
29.   The Owner of the Wanjiazhai dam project is Wanjiazhai Dam Construction
Management Bureau (WDCMB), under MWR. At present, the Emergency Preparedness
Plan has not been formulated yet. Considering the importance of the dam and the
catastrophic consequence of the dam incident, assurance have been obtained during
negotiations that an Emergency Preparedness Plan would be formulated by WDCMB
taking into account the Guide Lines for Emergency Preparedness Plan (Attachment 3) by
December 31, 1998.

- 259 -                     ANNEX 17
ATTACHMENT 3: GUIDELINES FOR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLAN
1.    A detailed Emergency Preparedness Plan (EPP) should be established for each
dam within the drainage area or operating system as a whole. If there is more than one
system operating within the same drainage area, the EPP should be coordinated by a joint
committee on emergency operation composed of representatives of all operating
organizations. The EPP should be approved by the Goveniment Agency.
2.    EPP should be reviewed at regular intervals for the need of updating and
adaptation to alterations of the physical and social environment, if necessary.
Appropriate intervals for the review may be periods of five to ten years depending upon
the progress of regional development.
3.    EPP should deal with, but not be limited to, the following aspects:
* hydrographic observation and flood warning scheme;
. drawdown and flood control operation of reservoir;
. emergency emptying of the reservoir;
. inundation maps for flows up to the design flood, and for catastrophic
conditions caused by dam failure;
* evacuation of flood-threatened areas;
. rescue operations and other emergency provisions;
. equipment, material and support available for emergency relief;
. coordination of emergency relief actions with third parties (for instance: civil
defense, police, hospitals, etc.);
. emergency standby of public utilities;
. emergency operation of power plant, water supply scheme associated with the
dam;
* emergency warning;
* emergency communication;
* emergency transportation;
. emergency access to the damsite;
* emergency decision-making process and procedures.
4.    EPP may be done for several types and modes of emergency but should include
the analysis of the most severe possibility; that is, the instantaneous failure of the dam.
The possible effect of the failure of upstream dams should also be taken into account.
5.    EPP should cope with emergency precautions and possible emergency repair
measures at the dam site and with warning and emergency relief action downstream of
the dam.
6.    Flood warning and emergency warning systems should be checked for reliability
and efficiency before the beginning of each flood season.



- 260 -                    ANNEX 17
7.    EPP should include instructions to be followed by the local operating staff in the
event of loss of communications with the leading control agency.
8.   In case of imminent danger or of a major accident, corrective action must be taken
immediately and independently of normal administrative procedures. Enough authority
should be vested in the operator's top level technical personnel to order emergency
preventive or repair measures without asking for special authorization from management.
9.    Clear and easily understandable emergency instructions should be issued to all
operating units. These emergency instructions, which must include a definition of the
supervising units authorized or obliged to issue orders under emergency conditions,
should be easily accessible. The need for updating should be checked periodically and
always after institutional, operational and administrative changes.
10.   Operating staff should be trained and periodically retrained in emergency
operations.



- 261-                      ANNEX 17
ATTACHMENT 4: GUIDELINES FOR DAM OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE
1.    The operation of a dam and reservoir needs to be understood in the context of the
multiple user who are involved, contractual agreements therewith, and best efforts
possible to optimize benefits for all.
2.    For each dam and reservoir, a reservoir capacity allocation scheme should be
prepared. The scheme should usually include the following items:
* Reservoir capacity allocation for different uses at several elevations and a
reference to the use allocations made in planning and designing the project.
. Flood regulation criteria and flood discharges.
* Sediment regulating rules and siltation.
* Water supply for irrigation.
. Water supply for municipal and industrial uses.
* Hydropower generating operation.
3.    To ensure the operational safety, the performance of the dam and appurtenant
structures should be carefully monitored. The monitoring should include, but not be
limited to, the following items:
4.    Instrumentation system, including the surface and embedded devices, should be
monitored at regular intervals. The accuracy of data obtained from the readings should be
checked annually for two or three years after commissioning of the dam and later at
longer intervals. The actual loads and loading combinations acting upon the structure
should be compared with those of the original design. At the same time, the original
design criteria and safety strategy should be reviewed with emphasis on the compatibility
with current technology.
5.    Visual examination of structures should be carried out at regular intervals. The
exposed surfaces of a concrete dam and appurtenant concrete structures should be
visually examined for cracks, spelling, leaching, leakage, indication of deterioration or
chemical reactions and damage from erosion or cavitation, etc.
6.    Earth rock fill embankments should be examined for cracks, leakage, saturated
areas, springs, sinkholes, evidence of piping, erosion, frost heave, crest alignment,
bulging or depression of slopes and berms, animal burrows, and the deterioration of
riprap or other slope protection materials.
7.    If the visual examination reveals evidence of material deterioration or unsafe
structural behavior, or yields doubts about the structural and/or operational safety, a more
in-depth investigation by core drilling, excavation of observation pits and/or other
appropriate methods should be initiated immediately.
8.    Underwater examinatioi should be made periodically for those parts which are
permanently submerged, such as lower part of the upstream slope or face of a dam and



- 262 -                     ANNEX 17
stilling basins. The examination can be implemented by sounding and/or by underwater
television camera.
9.    Drainage systems and uplift pressure relief devices should be examined for
possible obstruction, deterioration or damage by chemical reactions or bacterial growth.
Sources of seepage should be pinpointed and flow rate and quality (clear or muddy water)
should be investigated for comparison with previous observations and the results of
permeability computations.  Any anomalous changes in seepage volume shall be
investigated immediately.
10.   All mechanical and associated electrical equipment of the dam  should be
examined for proper functioning and adequate maintenance. Besides the accuracy of
operating performance, inspection should extend to lubrication and the functional
integrity of the equipment. Corroded, damaged or worn parts shall be replaced. An
adequate stock of spare parts must be maintained throughout the dam's service life.
11.   The service and emergency power sources and transmission should be examined
with special attention to the power supply under region-wide natural catastrophic
conditions.
12.   Siltation of the reservoir should be annually monitored by sounding.
13.   Critical areas of the reservoir rim should be inspected annually for five years and
later at least every three years for landslides and the indication of the development of
problems that might affect the safety of the dam or reservoir.
14.   The whole reservoir and its surroundings should remain under permanent
surveillance with respect to possible health problems. If foci of waterborne or water-
related diseases should develop, they must be brought under specialized medical control
immediately.
15.   Though pollution is normally not a direct consequence of reservoir or dam
operation, the operation unit should make every possible effort to detect sources of
pollution in order to enable the public health and other government authorities to enforce
pollution control.
16.   The adequacy and proper functioning of monitoring instruments and devices
should be checked at least every two years. The accuracy and correct functioning of the
hydrographic observation system, inclusive of telemetering and transmission devices,
should be checked before the beginning of every flood season.
17.   The sequence and frequency of the reading of monitoring instruments and
observation devices should follow the specific instructions given by the designer during
initial stage of operation, and later on can be revised according to the variation tendency
derived from accumulated data of previous years for different instruments and devices.



- 263 -                     ANNEX 17
18.   The readings of monitoring system should be processed and interpreted without
delay. Data and information should be carefully identified and filed for appraisal and
reference during the periodic inspections. Any substantial deviation from previous
observations or the anticipated behavior of the structure shall be brought immediately to
the attention of the inspection team.
19.   An inspection schedule should be established jointly by the operator and the
inspection team. This schedule should be set utp in accordance with the convenience and
requirements of operation. It would be advantageous to schedule the principal inspection
activities to coincide with major maintenance operations to facilitate the inspection of
equipment and the dewatering of water conduits, pump pits etc..
20.   A description of the methods and procedures employed for inspection and the
findings and resulting recommendations should be summarized in the inspection report.
Detected irregularities should be mapped for future reference and comparison. If any
remedial actions are deemed necessary, they should be proposed by clear
recommendations.  The report should be prepared immediately after finishing the
inspection and issued without delay.
