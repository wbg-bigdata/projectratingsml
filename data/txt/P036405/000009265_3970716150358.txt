CHAPTER I
1NIRW1UCflON
1.    Project Concept
The overall Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project (WWTP). which has been under study Ior su,me
three decades. is envisioned to comprise the follomsing components:
(a) General Main Line (GML). for delivering water from Wanjiazhai reservoir to it ;
branch lines, the South Main Line (included in the WWTP/Phase I project) and the
proposed future North Main Line.
(b) South Main Line (SML). for delivering water to the Taiyuan Service Area. including use
of Fen River. to deliver water to Fen-I reservoir. and Connection Works for delivery
from Fen-I reservoir to the Taiyuan Service Area
(c) Nordt iMain Line (NML). including some new reservoirs. for delivering water from
GML to the Pingshuo and Datong service areas.
The present Phase I project is limited to GML and SML but excludes the NML..Figure ES I-1 is
a schematic drawing xvhich illustrtes the ovemll project concept and those components
included in Phase 1.
The Phase I prcject includes two stages. (i) delivery of 1 million cumnday beginning in 'M(1
and (ii) another 0.76 million cum/day by 2004.
'T'aivuan is an important energy and chemical base of China. As a result of great shorLau oit
water, it is now depending on groundwater over-development. At prcsent. thc daily w:t.l:r
unavailabilitv is 425.000 min. Although 25.000 m3/dav is made availabic by means of
groundw:ater over-development. there is still a gap ol'200.000 mi. E:xtcnsivc groundwater over
development has lowered the groundwiater level fromni 50 m depth to 300 n.l has caused major
land subsidence in tihi cit'. and has mark-edly impaired nuter quality. 'hc only feasiblc solution
is to divert vater flow from the Yellow River svstem. and the need is vcr,v urgcnt.
The EIA concept is based on the premises that (i) the essential purpose of WWl'P is to iran.I er
%%ater to Taivuan and (ii) thc Yellow River Diversion Proiect Bureau (YRDP). vvilc nol
responsihic lor managing usc of the imported vater. will in close coopcmtion wvith bith
Provincial and City authorities to help ensue that the imported water. together w%ith local water.
uill be optimally utilized. including provisions for reducing water wastage. Ior maximizing
.ITeI rec% clina. and for management of wases to maintain acceptable water quality levels in
the Fen River both wvithin an below thc Citv.

Wanjiazhai Water Transfcr Project
FIA Executive Summary                                              Final Report
The purpose of the present study is to produce an EIA report for the WWTP as it is currently
planned, based on the utilization and updating of earlier studies of WWTP, which will meet the
requirements of MWR. NEPA, Shanxi EPB, and the World Bank.
Responsibility for preparing the EIA has been assigned by YRDP to CIRP/SU. with assistance
from a World Bank team. as shown in Figure ES. 1-2. The present EIA report has been prepared
over the period July 1995 to July 1996.
The EIA methodology utilized for the present study is that described in NEPA's EIA Guidelines
Modules prepred for NEPA by ADB in 1992, and now routinely used by NEPA and many
provincial EPBs. This methodology classifies environmental resources into four categories. (i)
natural physical resources. (ii) natural biological resources, (iii) human development resources,
and (iv) quality of life resources. The first step is to make an IEE (Initial Environmental
Examination) which identifies the SEls (significant envim l issues) ie., potentials for
adverse effets posed by the project components which must be evaluated by the EIA including
recommendations for modifications in the project planning sD the net overall envirmental
impact will be acceptable and/or positive. Each project component is then evaluated in terms of
these SEIs, and the necessary EPMs including enironmental monitoring programs are
formulated. The project's feasibility plan is then modified to icorporated these needs. Finally.
an overall Environmental Management Plan (EMP) is prepared, to be implemented as the
project proceeds, and an Environmenal Management Office (EMO) is established, within the
overall Project Management Structe, with responsibility for implementing the EMP.
Figure ES. 1-3 is a matrix which evaluates the information given in the available references
(Main Report Anmex A) as related to EIA needs. The EIA Work Program utilizes all of these
data. and in addition has carried out numerous additional studies to fill gaps.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
2.1   Project Area
The WWTP Proiect area is located in the northemn part of the Shanxi Province. in
North Chiina. The project area covers nine counties (district. city). namcl' Pianguan.
Pinglu. Shuozhou. Shenchi. Ningwu. Jingle. Loufan. Gujiao. and Taiyuan. Figure
ES.2-I shows the general location of the project.
2.2   Shanxi Province
The EIA main Report Section 2.1.2 gives background details on the geography of
Shanxi Province. including hydrology. morphology. climate. population. coal and
other mineral resources. industrv. and socio-economics.
The coal resources of Shanxi Province are by far the largest in China, over 203 billion
tons. The annual coal production in 1993 was 310 million tonls, about 30%M0 of the coal
production of the nation. and is sclieduled to reach 400 million tons at the end of this
centurv. In addition. the province contains China's second largest (after Shanghai)
concentration of industry. producinig alumina (over 50% of the nation). pig iron
(1 3%). steel and steel products (7/%). cement, sulfuric acid. and chemical fertilizers.
The province energy generating capacity (coal-thermnal power capacity) is scheduled
to reach 19;330 MW at the end of this century, representing about 7% of the nation's
clectrical energy. About 25% of the energy produced is exported to the North China
Grid.
Despite this industrialization level, the province is classed as poor with an annual
income per capita of only 11 US$ (the third lowest in China). Among the major
factors causing such poverty. the continuously increasing shortage of water is perhaps
the most serious. This represents a serious constraint on all types of developmnent.
2.3   Project.lustification
2.3.1 Nced for W'ater
Chapter 2 of the Main EIA Report gives details which describe the critical water
shortagc in Shanxi Province. certainly among the very worst in China. lThc total
estimated dcmand for the province. based on national avcrages. was 9.07 billion m; in
I!9JU. I .LO  billion in 2000. and 15.61 billion by 2020. Available annual sustainable
water supply from province sources amounts to 4.94 billion. with 2.5 billion from
suriace sources and 2.44 billion from groundwater. The current demand/supply ratio
is already atout 2 and by 202(. unless alleviated, is expected to reaab 3. In 1993. the
provincial per capita water consumption  as onilv 41% of China's average and 29% of
world average. The shortages arc acuteily elt in all sectors of economic activity.

Wnnjiazhai Water Transrer Project
ElA Executive Summary                                        Final Repon
Urban household is about 70 lcd. far below the China average of 174 lcd. Industrial
use is limited to 58% of need despitc about 83% recycling. Farm productivity per
hectare is among the lowest in China. due to lack of irigation water. and rural per
capital use (for animals and people) is only 36 lcd.
Considering only the three major urban centcrs in the province. Datong. Ping Shuo.
and Taiyuan. thesc three areas will need an additional average 1.36 billion m' of water
by year 2020 in order to continue a meaningful socio-economic system. Of the three
cities, the need in Taiyuan is considered to be more critical than for the other two.
Taiyuan is an important energy and chemical base of China. As a result of great
shortage of water. it is now depending on groundwater over-development. At present.
the daily water unavailability is 425,000 m3. Although 225.000 m3/day is made
available by means of groundwater over-development. there is still a gap of 200.000
m;. Extensive over-development of groundwater has enlarged the groundwater funnel
area in the city from 11.2 km2 in the 1 960s to 328 krm- in 1993 and has increased the
well depth from 50 m to over 300 m. Up to date. more than 800 wells have dried up
and abandoned. Water has been long supplied at a low pressure and even interrupted
in a total area of 42 kmn2, which directly affects the livelihood of 400,000 people. The
reconstruction and expansion of a series of large and middle-sized enterprises are
restricted by the shortage of water. At the Lancun water source (a major water
source). the water availability has decreased from 460.000 m3/day in the 1970s to
260.000 m3/day in 1993. Extensive groundwater over development has caused
deterioration of groundwater quality. settlement of ground and surface. unbalance of
the eco-environment. which endangers human health and environment. It is. very
urgent to seek new water sources for relaxing the critical water shortage in Taiyuan.
and the only feasible solution is to divert water flow from the Yellow River system.
2.3.2 Project Phasing
The overall WWVTP plan includes Phase I and Phase 11.
Phase 1 includes all civil works and water conveyance structures involved in GML.
SML and Connection Works, quarter electromechanical equipment for GML pumping
stations. and half electromechanical equipment for SML pumping stations. For water
diversion, the Phase I includes two stages. (i) a first stage I million m3 /day bv year
2001 and (ii) another 0.76 million ms/day by year 2004.
Phase 11 is expected to cover the remaining electromechanical equipmcnt lIbr GML
and SML pumping stations, Haoshuigou reservoir included in SML and other
facilitics as needed.

2.5   Project Alternatives
2.5.1 Alitcrnatives to \Wanjiazhai as Water Source
The dccision to import watcr from Wanjiazhai is based on numerous studies which
considered all possibic alternatives. These evaluations are discussed in detail in
Section 2.5.1 of Chapter 2. The various alternatives considcred are the following:
(a) Grotndwater: Not feasiblc because this source is already seriously over-
exploited. The question is not whether increased extraction of groundwater
can be tolerated. but whether current levels of extraction can be sustained
to vear 2001 when the project water is scheduled to become available.
(b) Local Suffice Water: The Fen River resource is alreadv being virtuallv
totallv exploited.
(c) ImportId Surface Water: The alternative for importation from the Yellow
River is to import from sub-basins within Shanxi. These sub-basins
supplies are already fully exploited for farning. but even so the farners
who make up the bulk of Shanxi Province population, are very poor
because the supply is low and even this is dwindling because of extractions
for M&I (municipal and industrial) uses. Also, the availability of these
waters is seasonal (not matching steady M&l needs) and uansportation
costs would be high.
The conclusion is that the Yellow River is the only feasible sourcc. Given this. is
Wanjiazhai the beat source? Extensic studies have shown that transfer from
Wanjiazhai is by far the least costly alternative. which is the reason why considcrabic
tunnel construction has already been carried out for the GML.
2.5.2 Transmission Svstem Routing
Bascd on survevs and route selection efforts over the past 3 decades. the current
alignment was determined on the basis of manv justifications. Construction worL has
been carried out, step by step. along GML and SML in respect of this alignment We
can do nothing now but makle some revisions for specific issues and give further
consideraiion to construction technologies.

2.5.3 SML Connection Works
As explained in Section 4.13 of Chapter 4. Connection Works", four alternatives
wcre considered for conveying the impoyned water from the end of SML Tunnel No. 7
-t lwvuari COMt As explained in Section 4.13. "Alterative 2" was selected as the
m:si weasibi- solution ior Phase 1. This plan makes use of the 81.2 km natural Fen
Kiver course to convex the imported water from the end of SML Tunnel No. 7 to the
existing Fen-i reservoir and then utilizes pipeltnes and tunnels to convev the water
from Fen-l reservoir to Taiyuan. thtis a% oiding usc of the Fen Rivcr for convevance

this rivcr reach due to leakage. and avoids the hazard of significant pollution runofl'

2.5.4  "Do Nothing" Alternative
With current water shortages in the Project Areas amounting to 40o of estimated
demand. and growing rapidly. and both ground and surface watcr supplies declining.
failure to complete the WWTP would engender economic. social. and environmenml
calamity. Pro3ections using the Provincial Planning Model (PPM) show that il' the
Project Areas' urban residents are to be given supplies equaling the norms for China.
and if farmers' water allocations arc to be preserved at current levels. industial and
mining activities would decline rapidly and virtually cease after the year 2010. 'Trhe
annual loss in industrial output would be 32 billion yuan in 2000, and 66 billion in
2010. The impact would be felt throughout China given the heavy reliance on
northern Shanxi's coal. heavy industry, and chemical output. Hundreds of thousands
of skilled workers would need to be relocated, any vast quantities of mineral and
fossil resources would go unexplored. It is not surprising that Chinese planners have
mentioned the possibility that Taiyuan and Datong would need to be relocated (at
incalculable cost) if WWTP water is not forthcoming. The PPM also shows that
sufficient water could be extracted from irrigation in northern Shanxi given significant
investmcnts in w-ater storage and convcyance. but probably at a cost for engineering
works exceeding that of WWTP. There would hc other prohibitive economic and
social costs associated with this policy. Already low agricultural incomes would be
scverclv ali'ected. and a million or more agricultural workers would need to be
relocated and retained. Alternative sources of food supplies would need to be found.
and the transportation and distribution network expanded and reorganized Even so.
the volumes of water that could be reallocated fom this option would be exhausted
long before the horizon of the WWTP planning peiod of 2020.

CHAPTER3
ENVIRONMEINTAL SETTING
3.1  Introduction
Purpose of chapter 3 are (i) delineates the Environmental Study Area (ESA) for the
Phase I project, comprising the areas that most likely to be affected the project. and
(ii) descnbes the existing environmental resources in the ESA.
Figure ES.3-1 shows the overall WWTP/Phase V/ESA. Figures 3.2.2.-1,2.3,4.5.6 of
the EIA Main Report (not included here) show the EIAs for the Phase I components,
namely Wanjiazhai Reservoir, GML, Fen-l Reservoir, Connection Works, and the
Taiyuan sevice area, respectively.
3.2   Land Use
The overall WWTP project area is primarily hilly and mountainous and the landuse in
the area can be broadly categorzed into fannland, gardenplot, forest grassland.
residential and industial area, inf i water area and wasteland area (Table
ES.3-1). Land use has long been impacted by human acfivities primarily agriculture,
and the impact has been particularly severe on the area's forest and wildlife resources.
Land use impact will be felt strongly in the buffer zones along the transmission lines.
the WWTP service areas, and the reservoir areas.
3.3   Nabtual Physical Resources
WWTP is located in the northwest part of the Shanxi Province. The project traverses
the Luliang mountain, to west of which is the main Yellow River Basin. The project
region enjoys tempe/seasonal/continental zone type of climate with the average
annual tmpeture between 4.6°C and 7°C. The area is drought prone and the annual
precipitation ranges between 430-480 mm. Table 3.4.3-5 in main report summarizes
the climate data for th- wWTP area.
The WWTP ared pL;ses through the Guancen Mountain range. several other major
tectonic features, and traverses two seismic zones. The soil in the GML is loose and
prone to erosion. excessive erosion has disturbed the ecological balance and affected
the land utility of the area. Soil in SML also is subjected to serious surfacc erosion.
Pianguan river, tributary of Yellow River. constitutes the major surface hydrnlogy for
the GML, and the Piangun, Jian-er, and Fen rivers for the SML.
The hydrological indices for the main rivers in the region are given in main rcport
Table 3.4.5-1. The underground hydrological conditions arc govemed by the regional
geological structure units. The groundwater along the WWTP is of good quality and
suitable for drinking and construction purposes.

EIA Executive Summary                                         Final Repnrt
3.4   Natural Biological Resources
The natural biological resources in the Phase I/ESA may be categorized into (i) forests
and other vegetation. (ii) terrestrial wildlife, and (iii) aquatic ecology. The area along
the GML and NML can be classified into the following flora zone categories, Pan-
North Pole flora zone, Eurasian steppe sublfora zone. Mongolian steppe zone and
Eastern Mongolian zone. Vegetation exhibits prairie and transitional characteristics,
with a wide variety of seeded plant species. Landform in the SML area is complex and
the climate varying hence different vegetation distributions are found, ranging from
temperate semi-arid to warm temperatc smi-arid prairie zone in Ningwu.
With respect to animal wildlife in the Phase I/EIA. because of low vegetation coverage
the animal habitats are limited. A total of 150 animal species are found, including 31
species of resource animals and some 22 species of state protected animals including 4
in the Class I rare category. However, all of the project component faeilities (excluding
tunnels) are located in already humanized developed areas. All of the protected species
live in areas remote from the project components locations/activities, hence should not
be affected by the project.
With respect to aquatic species, the ESA waterways contain relatively few aquatic
plants and aquatic animals. There are some 17 species of fish but there have no
commercial value and are all hardly of value even for subsidence. There are no known
rare aquatic spices which would be affected by the project. The Fen River at Taiyuan
is heavily affected by Taiyuan. by exactions and pollution discharges, and has no
significant remaining aquatic species values.
3.5   Development Resources
The area along the GML lines is prmarily an agricultural region with limited farming
and livestock because of limited water and mountainous terrain. Crops like millet,
beans. corn, naked oats. potato. sesame. broomcorn millet and fruits like apple. pears.
and grapes are grown. Livestock development is mainly in the fbrm sheep raising.
Agricultural production is also low in the SML area because of poor landform and
unfavorable climatic conditions. although it still is the main source of income for the
local people. The major crops are naked oats flax. soybean. Chinese yam, pea, broom
corn millet. spring wheat. comrn sorghum and other coarse cereals.
With respect to urbanization/industrialization. most of the project area is hilly and
mountainous and there is no significant urban development in the region. construction
of reservoirs in the future project phase will cause some resettlement of the local
populace. especially the farming community. Similarly. difficult terrain has prevented
-an% significanL industrial development from taking place in the region. Similarlvy
development of any significant regional infrastructure has been limited by the
inhospitable terrain.

3.6   Quulitv of Life Resources
The available information on socio-econoimiic conditions in the Phase liESA indicates
the following:
(a) Shanxi Province. including the WWTP/ESA. represents one of the poorest
regions in China. despite the presence of considerable mineral resources.
especially the coal mining and power industries.
(b) The people in the ESA, in the their reliance on economic income sources are
in zoughly two categories. (i) those in urban centers who are wcork-ing mainly
in industry. and (ii) rural villagers who depend mainly on agriculture. The
latter are much poorer than the former.
(c) By far the most important parameter. which is crippling the continuing
development of the province, is lack of water supply for all sectors of
development. This includes both the urban/industrial sector which represents
the backbone of the overall economic/social-economic resources of the
province, and the rural fanning sector where the people are very poor despite
availability of adequate farm land areas.
There are no precious archeological relics or monuments of historical or special
cu-lture located in any of the project component areas.

4 ENVI&ONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND EPM%
4.1       Methodology
4.1.1     Delineation of SEls
Chapters 4 and 5 present the essential findings of the EIA process. namely (i)
delineation of the SEls (Significant Enviromental Issues), (ii) evaluation of each of
these to make a quantified assessment of the potentials for adverse environmental effects
if no correction measures, i.e.. EPMs (Environmental Protection Measures) are utilized,
and (iii) delineation and quantification of the needed EPMs so that the project will be
economically sound. Needs for environmental monitoring during the construction and
operation stages are given in Chapter 7. Chapter 4 is concerned with the YRDP system
which will deliver the imported water to Taiyuan City (to the Huyan Water Treatment
Plant), and Chapter 5 focuses on use of the imported water by the City.
The various EIA tasks for Chapter 4 are named and numbered to match the
headings/numbers of the EIA Table of Contents. Some of the tasks cover the entire
project (for example, resettlement and public health) while others relate to specific
project components (such as the reservoir EIAs and the Taiyuan service area water use
evaluations).
4.12      EIA Strategy
As noted in Chiapter 1. the present WWTP/EIA has been prepared on the basis that the
bulk of the information needed for the EIA is available from numerous earlier studies.
most of which were done by Chinese Institutes. and that the EIA team would evaluate
those data to identify gaps and fill the gaps by means of field visits and discussions with
Chinese governmental agencies. Figure ES 1-5 of Chapter 1 summarizes the information
available from the various available studies. as related to the various EIA tables.
4.1.3    Initial Environmental Examinatiou
The Initial Environmental Examnination for the EIA. based on the infonnation available
from the earlier studies and other sources, identified the SEIs and rated their relative
importance. so that the subsequent EIA work effort would give primary attention to the
critical enviroramental issues. This evaluation. which is included in Figure ES 1-5. show
that the critical SEIs are the following:
(a)   Critical need for additional water for Taiyuan service area (Tasks 2.2.;23.4.
6.4).
(b)   Availability of water for diversion to Taiyuan (Task 4.12).
Xc)   Deliverv system:

4.1.4     EIA Task Procedure
liaeh of the SEIs considered in Chapter 4 is evaluated as a subsection of Chapter 4 as
-resented below. Each task evaluation includes as needed, (i) reference to the related
-uls:cCtion of Chapter 2 and 3. (ii) reference to information available from earlier (or
ongoing) studies. (ifl) description of the approach used by the EIA team for making the
assessment for the particular SEI, (iv) presentation of task results including
rteoinmendations for continuing EMO action.
4.2        Land Use
1ihe sitnilicant impacts of WWTP on land use for Phase Iwill be in (a) acquisition of land
lor thc trnaismission line facilities which are above giound, including construction camps,
a;d (h) land needed for disposal of tunnel excavation materials, which totally amounts to
sice 747.7 ha of which 301.7 ha will be used only temporarily. About 476.1 ha of the
rcLquirc.d lanid is farmland. However, the reduction of finiland, both permanent and
i.mlr;1rar . shotild not have any significant impacts on frmin in the region traversed by

Reservoir 640 million m' water to Taiyuan Service Area and 560 million ml to the
Pingshuo and Datong Service Areas when these are connected. However for Phasc 1.
limited to SML, only 640 million m' will be diverted. No reservoirs are included in
WWTP Phase 1. Phase I will utilize the existing Fen-l reservoir for regulation purposcs.
In Phase 11 three regulating reservoirs are to be built along the mainlines. namely
Haoshuigou, Daliang. and Zhaojiaxiaocun. Another reservoir. Fen-2. which is not
included in WWTP. is also to be built on Fen River upstream of Taiyuan City for flood
* control and emergency water supply purposes for Taiyuan City.
The diverted water will have significant positive impacts on the surface water hydrology
in three service areas. Assuming the recommended EPMs are properly followed and
implemented during both construction and operation stages. the project is expected to
have no significant negative impacts on hydrology in the Project ESA. I hsc of Fen-I
reservoir for regulating purposes will not adversely affect the existing function of' this
reservoir.
4.33 Flooding Hazards
4.3.3.1 Failure of Transmission Facilities
Flooding hazards are very unlikely to be caused by tunnel failures because the tunnels
are deeply in the ground. But flood hazards may be caused by pipe. aqueduct. or culvert
failurcs due to carthquakes. poor operations, and poor construction quality. When su;h
failure occurs, the monitoring and control system to be established along the pr.jecct uill
function to stop the divcrsion immediately. so the water released out the pipe or
aqueducts is limited to only the water volume in the transmission line between tivo
nearest valves (gates) which are designed to be promptly closed. The volume of any
such release would be less than 1.0 million rn3 with discharge rae less than 30 mW Is.
This should cause no serious damage to the area except inundating some surrounding
farmlands.
4.3.3.2 Discharge to Fen Rivcr
The only existing stream to which the diverted water will be discharged is the Fen River
on SML. While the imported vater volume will be about the same as the average ri%ve
flow. the imported volume will represent less than 1 percent of the Fen River flood flow
peaks. Hence the effect of the imported water on Fen River hydrology is expected to he
negligible.
With respect to the impact ot the sili content of the imported water on Fen River
siltation. the volumc of imported silt is only about 3%' of that in the river from local
runoll: hence the effect of the imported water will be to alleviate existing siltation
prohblems.

4.3.4 Groundwnter
4. 4.1 CGroundwater Interaction with Tuincls
All of the tunnels oni the GML and SML are locatcd above groundwater. so no
groundwater problems are expected. in cither construction or operations. Helce the
groundwater levels should have no significant effects on tunnel construction.
Boctusc thcre are no villages along the tunnel routes, and limited farnland. the tunnel
twpctations are not expected to exert an) negativc impact on groundwater use by
villagers along these routes.
4.3 .4.2 Groundwater Use for Construction
The surface water source available in the construction sites along WWTP nmain lines is
very I imited for construction water usage. Groundwater has to be used during the
construction stage, as follows.
(a)   GML: 16 wells with a total capacity of 14,280 m3/day.
(b)   SML 25 wells with a total capacity of 6.550 m3/day.
(c)   CW: 10 wells with a total capacity of l2,000 m3/day.
1nic needs of water and the sources to be utilized must be stated and identified by the
C' nstruction Contractors (CC) at the time of his proposal, and the CC must arrange to
.lbtain thc water he needs without impairment of existing beneficial water users and/or
with thc concurrence of the existing users.
Tile construction usage of groundwater will lower the groundwater table to some extent
during the construction period. However. the impacts should not be significant because
the iCCs wvells are located far from existing wells, will extract from areas not conflicting
witlh existing wells. and the amounts withdrawn for each well is small (less than 1.000
m :daiv .
4.3.5 Monitoring Program
Thc Projecfts EMO (See Chapter 9) will routinely check the CC's operations as related
it, ciTects on hydrology, so that all potentials for adverse effects will be suitably
controlled for the purposes of expediting construction and for avoiding and/or offsetting
an' conflicts with existing beneficial water uses. Following completion of construction.
thle 1.MO will carry out periodic monitoring of effects of WVITP operations on
a- t,412% ina ESA. including water quality. Details of these monitoring programs for
hoth construction and operations stages are given in the EIA Main Report Section 4.3.5.
4.4   Special Design Issues

Wanjiazhal Water Transfer Project
FIA Rxemtiv Summnary                                             Final Repnn
The purpose of Section 4.4. is to check to ensure that adequ'atc attention has been given
in the design of the. facilities to guard against any possible failure of the facilities in
event of earthquakes or any unusual hazards which may be encountered affecting
stability and functioning of structures and affecting workers health and safety.
4.4.2     Tunnel Hazrds
The concerns herm are that (a) the tunnel design take into account the earthquake hazard
in the region, (b) provision be made in the tunnel design to enable prompt repair of
tunnel failures, (c) the overall project plan.wili include sufficient storage in the system's
reservoirs to that the system can continue to function in the event of failure of delivery
of water because of tunnel collapse or any other reason, and (d) the tunnel construction
methods will include adequate attention to'&rkiheriIth amd safety.
In general the overall plan for WWTP will furnish two months storage for the target
service area in order to (i) enable shutdown of delivery from Wanjiazhai for two months,
and (ii) furniish enough storage to 6vercome the hazard of tunnel collapsc. Use of the
existing Fen I reservoir for regulation will fuiirish the needed two months of storage.
With respect to Item (d) above, in. order'to ensure adequatc protection for tunnel
workers, YI.DP has chariged the method for tunnel construction to use shield-protected
sore boring miacfiines, which do ensure adequate protection.
All of the other issues noted above have been carefully considered in thc cngineer:ng
planning for the project so that satisfactory performancc can Ii expected. provided the
recommended :PMs are duly carried out. Details alr  LISCussd int Main Report Section
4.4.2.
4.43         Silt Erosion Hazards
Because of the high turbidity of the Yellow River. the concern therc is whether the
pumps and other equipment till bc crodcd by silt and thus noi bc ablc to function
throughout their design life period. WWTP reports on this subject note that the
turbidities will not exceed levels of 3.000 to 4.000 ppm and that this does not represent a
serious constrint to pump equipment suppliers.

Wanliazhal Water Tansfer Project
FIA Fxneutivr Summary                                       Final ReBpn
This is a special problem for WWTP because of the large volume of tunnel excavation
materials to he disposed of. The engineering planning has made adequate provisions for
this problem in Phase 1.
4.4.6    Slit Deposition Problems
The concem here is whether the silt in the imported water might interfere with WWTP
operations. The analysis of this problem shows that no special problems shows arm
expected. The silt content of the imported water is only a small fraction, 3%, of the silt
carried by runoff from the Fen River watershed above Fen-I reservoir, hence the
importation should actually alleviate existing siltation problems.
4.5      Environmental Review of Resettlment (ERR)
4.5.1 Purpose and Scope of Task
The purpose of Section 4.5 is to review and assess the environmental soundness of the
RS plan presented in the WWTP/RS Report, to ensure that the recommended RS plan
will include all needed attention to applicable environmental prameerst including
effects on fte RS families, on host villages/faimilies, and affected community/regional
infrastructure. These key parameters are shown in Figure 4.5.1-1. Also. the plan must
give due attention to the timeliness of the various RS process components, so that
preparation of the new situation facilities (houses, land, etc.) will be ready for use at the
scheduled time for moving residences and/or land uses.
The RS program for any water resource project is always a vety sensitive environmental
issue. even when the magnifies of the problem is small with only few RS families
involved. Because WWwTP does not include any new reservoir the RS problem is
reigtively small for the project components included in Phase I. namely GML, SML, and
Connection Works. However, for EIA purposes. the overall ERR must also include
Wanjiazhai reservoir, the source of the water to be diverted by WWTP, which has a
large RS problem, and the Huyan Water Treatment Plant (and related pumping plart),
which involves significant urban RS problems.
4.5.2 Approach for Preparing ERR
Preparation of dte overall WWTP/RS plan has been carried out jointly by YRDP/World
Bank RS Team. with the final report submitted in early July 1996. This report includes
review and use of all earlier pertinent WWTP/RS studies and of additional studies for
Wanjiazhai carried out in June 1996.
For ERR purposes. on the basis of the types of RS problems involved. the overall ERR
study has been divided into four categories as follows:
(i) EML Disturbance in rural areas to both housing and farm production lands.

EIA Exeiive Summnr3y                                       Final Reponr
(ii) SML and CWs: Disturbances in rural communities only on farm production
lands. with no housing losses.
(iii)Huyan Only urban land use changes, with no housing losses.
(iv)3Mj*iazhnit Major disturbances in rural communities including both housing
and farm production lands.
4.53 ERR Parameters
The WWTP/ERR has been pattemed after the ERR done a few years ago for the
Xiaolangdi project. This includes several major categories, with various sub-categories.
for the issues of (i) accommodating RS families, (ii) accommodating host communities.
(iii) regional infrastructure needs, (iv) public participation. (v) monitoring plan
adequacy, and (vi) overall assessment.
4.5.4 Summary and Conclusions
Figure 4.5-1 shows the summnaized results of the ERR, for each of the four RS project
categories, for each of the applicable ERR parameters. Review of this information
indicates that the RS Planning programs are reasonable adequate for all four RS sectors.
However, the YRDPIEMO will monitor the RS progress periodically for all Phase I
components (GML, SML, CWs) and also with check progress for Wanjiazhai. working
with the Wanjiazhai EMO, and for Huyan. woddng with TEPB. This includes checking
on progress on the Phase I/RS training progrm.
Evidence of the thoroughness of the WWTP/Phase I/RS project is given by the
numerous detailed tables and summary tables included in the Main RS Report, which
cover all aspects of the Phase I/RS program. Four of these summary reports are included
here for purpose of illustration:
Table ES.4.5-1    Main Physical Indexes of WWTP
Table ES.4.5-2    Farmland Compensation Standards and Criteria
Table ES.4.5-3    Schedule of Monitoring and Costs
Table ES.4.5-4    Training Program for Phase I/RS.
with respect to Table ES.4.5-2, the Main RS report includes similar tabulations for other
lost properties including forest land, housing including yards and amenities, and
infrastructure.
4.5.5 FoDlow-Up Monitoring
The YRDP/EMO will carry out periodic surveillance of the RS program as rclatcd to
environment. as part of the EMO monitoring programs described in Clapters 8 and 9.
for each of the YRDP project components (GML. SML. CWs). ln addition the
YRDPIEMO should. in cooperation with the Wanjiazhai/EMO1. slould periodically
check progress on attention to environmental aspects of Wanjiazhai/RS. and in
cooperation with TEPB. for Huyan!RS.

Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project
EIA Ixecutive Iismmnr*                                       Final Report
The WWTP Expert Panel for Environment and Resettlement is also expected to make
periodic reviews and recommendations for all four RS sector projects.
4.6   Public Health
4.6.1 Introduction
Water resource development projccts generally pose significant public health disease
transmission hazards, for both enteric diseases and insect vector diseases. However.
iany of the disease hazards associated with water resource development projects stem
from construction of dams/reservoirs, and the WWTP Phase I Project does not include
any new dams/reservoirs. WWTP takes water from Wanjiazhai Reservoir, but
Wanjiazhai dam/reservoir is not included in WWTP and its health effects are outside the
WWTP/ESA.
4.6.2 Background
4.6.2.1 Enteric Disease Hazards
(a)   Constrction Workers: This is the hazard of epidemic of enteric diseases, such
as typhoid and dysentery, which likely will occur if proper precautions are not taken
during the construction stage. AES is well aware of this bazard, especially because of
very serious typhoid epidemics which occurred during construction of Fen-I reservoir in
1958 (over 1,000 cases) and of Wenyu reservoir in 1960 (700 cases).
(b)   Resettlement Vlles: The need here is to ensure that resettlement homes are
furnished with safe drinking water (chlorine residual in tap water) and sanitary exereta
management, and that the method selected for solid waste management is sanitary. This
is part of the job of resettlement planning. It should be noted that the Phase I Project
involves only minor resettlement problems.
4.6.2.2 Insect Vector Disease Hazards
The AES experience indicates that malaria has not been a problem in Shanxi province
but both encephalitis and HF arc significant.
The control program for cncephalitis will comprise two measures: (i) periodic
spraying of construction zonc buildings with insecticide (for mosquito control for both
encephalitis and malaria). and (ii) periodic larval surveys in the vicinity of WWTP
reservoirs to detect presence of mosquito species for encephalitis and malaria. say every
six months.
Haemorragic fever was first detected in Shanxi province in 1981 and an epidemic
occurred in 1984-85 (1 .000 cases). and since there have been 100 to 200 cases per year.

WanJIazlhni Watcr Trunsfcr Project
FIA REeculive Suimmnr                                           Final Renort
The pertinent availablc statistical data for mortalityimorbidity for the pertinent diseases
are included in the Main EIA Rcport. Rcview indicates the following:
(i) Morbidity rates for hepatitis are quite low compared to rates in other nearby
provinces. However, Shanxi typhoid morbidity rates are about the sanmc as
national rates and rates for nearby provinces.
(ii) Encephalitis, malaria. and haemorragic morbidity rates in Shanxi province
are quite low compared to nalional rates and also considerably lower than in
nearby provinces. Probably this is because Shanxi province is relatively dry.
(iii)Within Shanxi province. both enteric and insect vector disease rates are
higher in the southem part (compared to the north) because of warmer and
less arid conditions.
4.6.3 Recommended WWTP Action Program
4.6.3.1 Enteric Diseses
The WWTP construction program should include provisions for protection against
outbreaks of enteric diseases such as typhoid and dysentery. by (i) provision of adequate
and safe water supply and sanitation facilities for construction workers and (ii) medical
examination (initial and periodic) for construction workers. Also the housing buildings
for construction worklers should be periodically sprayed with insecticides for mosquito
control. These mcasures %phich arc the same as now being employed for construction of
Xiaolangdi.
4.6.3.2 Insect Vector Diseases
While Phase I Project will niot 1inancc any damstreservoirs nor any irrigation facilities
hence Phase I will not affect these discascs. I lowcvcr. it is recommended that the Phase
I Project should include close check on incidenec of thesc three diseases in the overall
WWTP region and ifany significant increases occur in anv of thcsc. then special control
measures should be implemcnted.
During Phasc I it will be necessary to monitor rat densities in the construction zones,
which may tend to increase due to lhe lbod available there. and if significant increases
occur. rat killing measurcs should be c.arried out to prevent increases in haemorragic
fever due to the project.
4.6.3.3     Summarized Action Program
The summarized action programn is shown in Figure l E 4.6-I
4.7    Ecology
The WWTP/Phase I will convey water to the Taiyuan Service Area by passing through
the following areas in sequence. (i) mountainous zone, wherc the facilities are
underground. (ii) the Fen river. over a reach of some 81.2 km, (iii) thc Connection
Works region. for delivery of water from Fen-l reservoir to the Taiyuan Service Area.
Effects on ecology in the mountainous zone will be negligible because the system
facilities are essentially underground. There are some 22 species of state protected

species in thc mountain arcas. but these are remove from urbanizing/industrializing
areas and should not bc affected by the project.
There will he an impact on thc Fen River reach utilized for conveyance. above Fen-l
rcservoir. both for flora and fauna. At present this river reach includes no valuable
fishery. not even for subsistence, and no valuable rare species. Because the overall
WWTP will include rigid control of pollution discharges to the river. including
industrial discharges, and because WWTP will add clean fresh water which will increase
the river flow volumc. the river water quality should be significantly improved and this
should significantly improve habitats for both flora and fauna. The introduction of
different species from Wanjiazhai reservoir will modify the eco-balance in the river and
in Fen-l reservoir but this should hardly affect the overall aquatic ecology in the region.
Thc natural ecologv in both the Connection Works area and Taiyuan Service Area have
been essentially displaced by existing development.
Figure ES 4.7-I summarizes the anticipated project affects on the ESA ecology.
4.8   Reservoir EIAs
4.8.1 Introduction
Earlier EIAs for WWTP have discussed the enviromnmental impacts by Wanjiazhai
Daliang. Zhaojiaxiaocun. and Haoshuigou reservoirs, and details on this can be found in
relevant EIAs (see Ref. 130. 101. 102). Considering that the present EIA covers onl,
WVTP Phase 1. Section 4.8 is limited to discussion of Wanjiazhai reservoir as the
source of WWVTP water and Fen-1 reservoir which will be utilized for regulation
purposes as part of the Phase I water conveyance schemne. Fen-I reservoir is an old
reservoir which has been operating for some 35 years, and possible envronmental
effects due to the changed operation pattern are evaluated. However. the other reservoirs
mentioned above, namely Daliang. Zhaojiaxiaocun. and Haoshuigou reservoirs, are not
included in this present EIA.
4.8.2 Wanjiazhai Reservoir
Table ES.4.8-1 shows the main features and design criteria for the Wanjiazhai
dam/reservoir project which is being constructed by MWR.
As shown by Figure ES.4.8- 1. the Wanjaiazhai EIA shows that the project should not
cause any significant problems of enviromnental degradation. provided it is designed
and operated as planned. including incorporation of the EPMs specified in thc EIA and
including cnvironmental monitoring in both construction and operation stage. and
includin- implementation of provisions for resettlement as specified in Sectiorn 4.5 of
the prcsent repnrt.
A potential adverse effect on WWTP is the silt content of the diverted water (about 1%)
in possibly causing siltation/flooding problems in the Fen river system. but the EIA
analy-sis shows that silt content of the imported water is much less than in the Fen River

(3.3%). hence the effcctsi ol'importationi will he hencricial. The proiect will result in
large-scale positive hencfits including nood control and power production aid
availability of wnter for cxport to the WWTP targcl areas.
Export of Wanjiazhai water for WW'TP will decrease the total water avoilability in the
Lowcr Yellow Rivcr Basin. but thc approved overall govemmental plan lbr allocation of
the Ycilow Rivcr water resourcc includes provisions for the WWT1'P diversion needs tsc
Section 4.12).
4.8.3 Fen-I Reservoir
T'he construction stage for altering Feci-l reservoir so it can perform its regulating role is
not expected to result in any signiricant advcrse effects and the existing environmental
resources in the vicinity.
Use of Fen-l reservoir for WWTP regulation. following construction. will bring about
minor changes in reservoir hydrology. but without adverse effects. and the existing flood
protection function of the reservoir w%ill be small compared to that from local runoff.
hence no adverse effects are expected. The imported water inflow will result in some
shift in tile reservoir aquatic ecology balance. but this should not result in any adverse
effects on the reservoir fishery nor on the regional aquatic ecology.
4.9   Erosion'and Sedimentation
Assuming that the contracts for the CCs include provisions as noted in SecLion 4.8.2 of
the EIA Main Report and assuming proper use of environmental construction inspectors
(Section 4.11). construction of WWTP should not cause any significant erosion
problems. The EMO should continually check the construdtion operations through
environment construction inspectors, and ensure that all erosion prevention measures are
followed by CCs during the project construction.
The sedimentation due to the silt content in the diverted water has been duly considered
by the design engineers and arrangements for eflectivcly managing this silt have becn
included in project design and plan. Because the diverted silt represents only a small
amount of thc total silt reaching the Fen River course and Fen-l Reservoir. around 3
percent, no significant impacts are expected on sedimentation in the areas along SML.
4.10  Quality fo Life
4.10.1 Peopil Living aong Water Transmission System
The only significant effect of WWTP transmission system will be impacts on people
whose houses or lands will be tak-en over and utilized for these facilities. As noted in
SLction 4.5. Environmental Review of Resettlemenr'. all of these losses will be
compensated for. at rates such that the net effect is expected toi be bcnefitcial for all
a fsxted families.

4.10.2 Taiyuan Service Area (TSA)
WWTP will certainly result in great improvements in quality of life in TSA. all made
possible by the availability of the imported water to alleviate the existing severe water
shortage. These benefits include (i) considerRbly increased family income resulting from
improved industrial productivity, (ii) marked increase in per capita water use. so that
residents will have decent amounts of water for washing and bathing and for toilets, (iii)
significant decrease in disease rates for enteric diseases, stemming from steady
availability of piper water to homes/buildings. and (iv) great improvements in urban
greening areas and in urban recreational areas.
4.11 Construction Constraints
4.11.1 General Constraints on Construction Contractor (CC)
Historically CCs have often caused unnecessary environmental damage, sometimes
serious, simply because it is the nature of the CC, and of the Engineering Supervision of
Construction, to focus on expediting building of the projects' physical components, with
relatively low-priority attention to EPMs. However, experience has shown that it is
quite feasible/affordable for the CC to observe asii comply with the EPMs specified in
EIA, provided these are included in the TOR for the CC's constuction contract and
provided an ECI is made availabe by EMO to observe the CC's operadons and to
require compliance. Figure ES.4. 1-1 sununarizes the constraints applicable to CCs. The
Expert Panel on Environment and Resettlement for the Xiaolangdi project has been
observing and evaluating actual environmental effects for the Xiaolangdi construction
stage for more than a- yeai with a report produced by the Panel every six months. It is
recommended that the YRDP Engineering staff for WWTP obtain and study these
repDorts. beginning with the report of September 1995 (Ref. 211.1).
4.11.2 Disposal of Tunnel Excavation Materials
A special environmental problem for WWTP/Phase I construction is disposal of tunnel
excavation materials so as not to cause environmental damage including use of lands
better used for farming, creation of flooding hazards, hazards of runoff of these
materials to cause pol lution/damage. and dispelling of environmental scenery.. For these
reasons the WWTP/Phase I planning includes provision of detiled schemes so that
disposal will be accomplishld in a manner which is environmentally sound, as presented
in the EIA Main ReporL Section 4.11.4. including Figure 4.11 .4-1.
4.12 Interbasin Water Transfer FeasibDity
WWTP has been an approved component of the Government's overall Yellow River
Basin Plan for the past two decades. This will divert about 2% of the mean annual river
flow and about 5 percent of dry year flo%s, but the Wanjiazhai storage is from periods
of higher river flow, and this should not pose hardships on downstream water users. This
issue was further investigated h! tlic World l3ank's evaluation of the Xiaolandi project
using the Bankl's Basin Level Plamni M ;Iodel. These studies confirmed that the WWTP

will not create problems lbr thc downstream users assuming that all "Sharcholders il
the river do not extract more than their allocatcd share.
4.13 Connection Works
The Connection Works. to be built in Phase L. will deliver the imported water from thc
end of the SML tunnels to Taiyuan City (at the City's Huyan Water Treatment Plant).
The Connections Works complex makes use of natural river course of the Fen river
system up to Fen-1 reservoir and of underground pipes and tunnels from Fen-l reservoir
to the Huyan Water Treatment Plant.
The EIA for the CWs (Connection Works), described in EIA Main Report Section 4.13.
notes that (i) because the CWs are located in already dcveloped areas. there will bc no
adverse effects on forests/wildlife. (ii) no adverse effects on aquatic ecology (in Fen
River and Fen-l Reservoir) are expected, (iii) no adverse effects on Fen-l Reservoir
existing operating functions are expected, (iv) no effect on archeological/historic or
cultural values are expected, and (v) there will bc some use of land now used for otlher
purposes, but only some 16 ha permanently and 235 ha on a temporarT basis. (vi) there
will be no significant changes in the quality of the imported water due to river passage
and reservoir storage. and (vii) the only significant hazard for environment will be that
for the construction stage.
Measures for managing the construction stage hazards are discussed in ES Section 4.1 1.
These include provisions for disposal of construction fill materials.
4.14 Global Environmental Issues
Tnie primary enviromnental concens, from the global point of view, are: (i) earth
warming. (ii) ozone layer increase. and (iii) biological diversity degradation.
Because the WWTP components which are above ground are in areas which are already
"humanized". uith little significant remaining natural ecological resources, the project
expected to have any significant effects on the biodiversity situation in the ESA region.
However. the monitoring program to be managed by EMO will include an annual survey
of the status of ecology in ESA including forests. swamps. and wildlife.
The project does not involve use or production of substances to be discharged to
atmosphere which will contribute to ozone layer depletion.
The project will require cxpenditure of a considerable amount of electrical energy for
enabling pumping of the imporLed water into the service areas, but this total amnoum is
insignificant in terms of China's production of earth wanning gases from buming of
coal. Hence. the project should have no significant impact on China's total contribution
to earth warming.

VATER Sl1PPLY AD    LTN CONTROL
5.1   Introduction
Bccausc of the importance of ensuring optimal use of the cxpensive imported water.
including rcusc and water pollution control. the environmental assessment for the various
environmental issucs relating to water supply and pollution control arc presented separately
here in Chaptcr 5. rather than in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 is an extension of Clupter 4.
5.2   Water Supply
(a) The water demand. supply. and balance for Taiyuan indicate that water is currently in
short supply (overdraft of 89 million cubic meters of groundwater in 1993). The forecasts
of water demand. supply and balance with and without the WWTP project for the years
2002. 2010. and 2020 are shown in Tablc ES.5-1. The forecasts indicate an increasingly
serious shortage of water unless the WWTP project is implemented. This projected
shortagc is expccted to drastically impact the qualitv of life, worsen living conditions and
limit urban and industrial growth in the area. With the WWTP project. the areas will have
adequate watcr supplies to meet demand until the year 2020 and beyond. provided that
wvater recycling and wastewater reuse are practiced.
(b) Thc wwrr rroject will bring new water to the city to augment the existing water supply.
The new water will have to be treated before distribution for final uses and this treatment
and additiinal distributitii facilitics will require additional investnent.  Costs for
treatment aid distribution. therefire. should bc a part of the WWTP and properly
rinanced. Cost estimates to co%nor the additional watcr treatment and distribution for
Taivuan are in the RMB 2.34 billion range.
(c) The incrcased urban and industrial activities that will result from the provision of new
water will also result in increased wastewater discharge back to the rivers. In order to
maintain the quality o thc river wvater supply. the discharges will have to be strictly
controlled. Consequently. an investmcnt in wasteuater treatment will be essential to
restore and maintain an acceptable level of water quality in the Fen River. Wastewater
treatment %%ill also makec possibic the reuse ol treated clnluents and conserve new water.
(d) The costs/benefits of the WXTP projcct appear to bc very positive based on economic.
and sociaUenvironmental considerations. Social conditions, which include the quality of
life and encompass public health. recreation. and pollution. should generall improve with
the project. The economic factors. which arc the primary driving force for the WWTP
proCeCL appear ui be verv favorable. For example. the loss of revenues which can be
attributed to the shortage of water is estimated at over RMB 2.24 billion for Taivuan for
ES.5-Il

1993 alone. whilc thc investmcnt require.l lor the W'W\\'T'P is about RMB 1:.6 billion over
lhe next IO years.
5.3   Water Pollution Control
(a) T'hc WWTP project will generatc wasteater that will have to be managed. along with
existing wastewaters. so that cnvironmncital pollution impacts are properly controlled
and managed. The increased wastewatcr volumes that will result from new water
have been rorecasted for the years 2002. 201 0. and 2020 for Taiyuan (114 1 0**4 cm/d
ror 2002. 156 for 2010. and 207 lor 2020). Sincc the volumes of new wastewater will
bc very high. wastewater recycling and wastewater treatmeni will be necessary to
reduce the impact on water quality in the river. The potential wastewater volumes
which may be recycled for agricultural/farm irrigation and industrial uses hiave been
estimated.
(b) Assuming that primary treatmcnt is required for agricultural reuse, secondary
treatment is required for discharge and for agricultural and industrial reuse. Taiyuan
MEDI has developed a plan to increase wastewater treatment capabilities to almost
1 00 % for the target years. The plan is summarized in the following:
Year                     1995        2002         2010         2020

* Adapted from Table 5.3.3-6 of Main Report
The plan calls for the use of stabilization ponds in the tributaries of Fen River and
along the banks of Fen River to provide additional polislhing during 2002 and 2010
when wastewater collection and tratment plants are being built. The target is to
phase out stabilization ponds and have sufricient collection systems and treatment
plants by 2020. The cost estimates for treating wastewater generated until th.e year
2020 for Taiyuan have been developed. The preliminary estimated treatment costs for
the period until 2020 are about RMB 2.8 billion. These investments will be necessary
in order to achieve the goal of the NWWTP project. Because of the size of the
inestimen1tl the approach is to use stabilization ponds as intcrim treatment while

(c) To ensure that industries and municipalities will treat their wastewater prior to
dischargc, an area-wide regulntory'implemcntation agency will be established to
perfonn the functions currently being accomplished by several governmental agencics
with the following functions:
(cl)   Regulating water use to ensure optimal overall use of thc limited water supply.
with priority to substitute use of treated effluent by industries in place of using,
freshwater, and the use of treated effluents for other reuse purposes including
agricultural irrigation and groundwater recharging, so that freshwater supplies
are used for high quality use purposes including community water supply, to
be achieved by establishing an appropriate pricing structure and by
monitoring/enforcement.
(c2)   Establishing appropriate standards for wastewater treatment and for reuse of
treated wastewater as water supply.
(.3).  Establishing a pennit system which requires all industries which produce
significant wvastes (liqluid and solid) to huild/Apratc their nwn treatment

monitoring program.
(d) The water pollution management system of Taiymn City. as discussed above. is
indicated to be consistent with WB policies given in Reference 306. -Water Supply.
Sanitation. and Enviromental Sustainability, the Financing Challenge'.
5A    Water Quality
(a) The impact of the planned WWTP water conveyancc system on the qualitv of the
imported water should not be significant for all salient water quality parameters because
the system will comprise mostly tunnels and culverts that will be enclosed. HIowever. the
receiving Fen River is an open stream and will bc vulnerablc to contamination.
(b) The quality of the raw water delivered to Taiyuan and other servicc areas will correspind
to Class In in the National Government's classification system. Based on thei aailaible
ES.5-3



Wanjizhui Water 1runilfr Prject
Ix1A Fxeutive 91ummnr                                                I'inl Reno
data on Yellow River water quality at Wanjiazhai and elsewhere in ihl Yellow River
system. it appears that the imported water delivered to the service areas will be suitable
for a raw water supply for all intended uses. with treatment necded to muct drinking water
standards. Conventional rapid sand filtration with eMuent chlorination should meet this
need.
(c) The WWTP project is not expected to adversely affect groundwater quality in the ESA
except during the construction stages when use of groundwater by the CC must be strictly
controlled.
(d) The major potential impact on water quality is expected to be increased industrial and
uiran wastewater discharges generated by the availability of new water. The city of
Taiyuan will have to provide wastewater collection and treatment for all new and existing
sources, in order to maintain water quality in the river. If the treatment plan developed by
Taiyuan MEDI is implemented, it is expected that the water quality in Fen River will not
be adversely impacted by wastewater discharges. The predicted COD concentration in
the Fen River would be much lower than the current condition at Xiao Dian, as shown in
Table ES.5-2. In addition. Taiyuan should maximize water recycling and the reuse of
wastewater in order to conserve water as well as to minimize potential adverse impacts on
the Fen River.
(e) Protective measures will be implemented to alleviate potential impacts on the quality of
surface water and groundwater. One needed measure is to price the water in a way that
vill encourage water recycling and wastewater treatment. A complementary measure will
be implementation of a permit system similar to that used in the USA to require industries
and municipalities to treat wastewater to meet standards prior to discharge. A permit
system involves establishing appropriate discharge standards. monitoring the quality of
discharge effluents. and enforcing the regulations through a penalty system for violators.
River water toxicity will be controlled. primarily by the use of the pennit system. so that
existing toxicitv discharges from industries will cease. The pricing, implementation of a
pernit system and other functions could be best performed by an area-wide water control
agency.
(f) The control agency will have responsibility for continuing evaluation of the water
supply/use situation in the Taiyuan service area, as the basis for developing the optimal
plan for water use and reuse and river water pollution control. In this plan. groundwater
use will be minimized so that over-pumping will be stopped and so the eroundwater
levels can be recovered. including use of groundwater recharging. The plan will place
high priority on use of trcated wastewater effluents for industry anI irrirpation an! thl ;;
conserve freshwater for community use including drigking.

an integral part of tihe overall WWTP project. If any one of these components is

ol'the WWTP project.
5.5   Integrated Management for Water Supply and Pollution Control
(a) To ensure optimal use of existing and new water. an area-wide regulatory/implementation
company is to be established tu perform the functions currently being accomplished by
several governmental agencies. The initial plan is to fonn a holding company which
would
have five subsidiaries each would have its distinctive functions together to achieve the
target of optimal use of water. and each have its own profit and loss responsibilities. The
functions of the 5 subsidiaries of this new company as related to water and waste
management are illustrated in Figure ES.5-1.
(b) The existing permit system is to be upgraded to become really effective including strict
enforcement. This is essential for success of the proposed integrated system. The
program should involve (i) establishing/using appropriate permit procedure. including
requirement for recycling and use of clean technologies, (ii) setting appropriate discharge
and reuse standards. (iii) monitoring discharge concentrations and river quality, and
enforcing requirements through penalties for violators.
(c) Education and training of industrial and municipal staff and the public about the
significance of uncontrolled discharges and the importance of treatment will bc
implemented to promote awareness and acceptance of the program. Details of the
training and education to raise public awareness on water conservation. pollution control
and optimal use of water are discussed in Chapter B.
(dl T'he Taiyuan City EPB (TEPB) has submitted a proposal to WB for technical Assistance
in the amount of US $2 million for strngthening TEPB's institutional resources for
TEPB's share in accomplishing the objectives noted above, plus the recommendation that
the overall project loan include an allocation of US $10 million for establishing a Clean
Technologies Fund for industries. These progamms are both consistent with and
supplementary and complementary to the recommendatons made in the present EIA.
5.6   Environmental Management Achievement in Taiyuan City
Despite the many difficulties involved, the Taiyuan city agencies, working in close
c.i(pcration with the Provincial agencies. have over the past decade made impressive progress
in rlanning and implementing a comprehensive water pollution program in the Taivuan
ccr. .ce area. This includes:
{ax Preparation of a comprehensive municipal sewerage management planm and
implementation of the plan including treatment of some 19 % of the total city sewage,
wvith planning to achieve comprehensive control by year 2020.

(b) Establish of a permit sysiem ror conltrol of industrial waste diselarges. resulting in much
more plant recycling and use of in-plant trcutment to meet discharge requirements
including reduction in discharge of heavy metals.
(c) Establishment of a comprehensive water quality monitoring program, covering both
pollution sources and ambient water quality of rcceiving waters, to gain factual data on
the extent and naturc of wasle management problems.
(d) Initiation of other measures including public education on water conservation, reducing
leakage in water supply distribution. promoting industrial water reuses and other reuse of
treated effluents.
In summary, these activities represent a good beginning steps towards achieving optimal
water use/reuse/pollution control, and arc finn evidence of the keen interest of the local
officials in striving to solve their water use/pollution problems and of their willingness to
give real support to achieving the goals of the proposed WWTP.

ADDITIONAL STUnIFS
6.1 INTRODUCTION
The overall EIA includes in addition to the regular assessments made in Chapter 4 and
5. some additional evaluations which become incorporated into EIA practice over the
past two decades. These include (i) public participation, (ii) compliance with
envimonmental laws, (iii) environmental economics, and (iv) risk assessment.
6.2 Public Participation (PP)
The YRDP has been ctive in PP work on WWTP even since initial establishment of
YRDP in the 1950s. Thee activities have incresed over the yeas as YRDP's role
has expanded, with detailed attention beginning in 1992. These effects arc presented
in the main report (Table 6.2-1 and Annex D). A summwy of this is given here in
Figure ES.6.2-1.
In addition to the above, the present YRDP/WB study and eport on Resttlement
(RS) for WWTP has included special attention to PP for all WWTP/Phase I project
components where RS is involved. The present EIA includes a Section 4.5 entitled
"Envirownental Review of RS", which reviews the Phase I RS Plan from the
enviromental point of view. This review is summaized in Figure 4.5.6-1.
Both the Phase l/RS Plan report and the Phase I/EIA report indude chapters on
monitoring. The RS monitoring plan includes periodic checking of the entire RS plan
progress including environmental components, and the EIA monitoring plan including
periodic checking of this by dte EMO. In addition, YRDP/WB will establish an
independent Expert Panel (similar to that now being used for Xiaolangdi project)
which will meet twice per year to review and advise on progress on both Environment
and Resdtlement during the Phase I construction period.
Information on public participation for the Wanjiazhai and Huyan projects (not
included in Phase I) is included in Section 4.5 on Resettlement.
6.3 Compliance with Environmental Laws
Both NEPA and the World Bank require that the EIA include information showing
how the project complies with China's environmental laws and regulations. The full
scale EIA study has included such attention to all known environmental laws and
rcgulati'mns apolicable to WWTP. This information is sumarized in Figure ES.6.3-1.
6.4 Environmental Economics
The purpose of this task is to review the WWTP plan with respect to (a) whether the
project gives fair consideration to the needs of ordinary/poor people in the affected
area (so that it is not another -rich get richer. poor get poorer' project). (b) to check
that the Economic Analysis includes the costs of all EPMs including environmenal

monitoring programs specified by the E1A, and (c) to check that the Economic
Analysis Includes costs representing environmental damages not offset by the EPMs.
plus credits for any environmental enhancement measures included in the project.
WWTP may truly be said to be a project planned with the primary objectives of
improving the socio-economics of the primary economics eanings areas of Shanxi
province. These are already critically short of water for virtuaUy all human
development needs including (i). domestic and commercial, (ii) industrial, and (iii)
agricultural needs. The imported vater will be used first for municipal purposs,
representing first priority, with second priority to industry maintain employment
stability, and not for (iii) agriculture. It is also planned to reduce use of existing fresh
water resources for griculture by substituting use of treated ewage effluents. In
addition, the imported water will reduce pressures for more and more groundwaer
extraction (now very seriously overextracted) resolving in more and more ground
level subsidence, already very serious and causing serious economic/socio-economic
losses to all affected community social sectors. Thus the project may be said to be a
truly economic-cm-environmental.cum social development project.
The argument may be made that the project favors the socio.economics of the
urbanized taret -a, which are less poor han the nal as. This is true, but it is
these trget aras that are of prime importance to the over economy and socio-
economics of the entire province. Also, wbere reservoirs are to be built as part of the
project, it is planned that the resetd rual farmers will be benefited, that is, their
housing and income levels should be improved as a result of the resettlement. This
applies also to Wanjiazhai Reservoir (not financed by Phase I).
Item (b) above has be  ensred by coninuing close working associaion beween the
EIA tem amnd the Phase I Project Economics Expe  With respect to Item (c),
asming implementation of the recmmended EPMs including ewvironmental
monitoring progams, it is expected that the residual net environmel damages will
not be significant. This will be checked periodically by the environmental monitoring
progam to be managed by EMO.
6.5 RISK ASSESSMENT
Figure ES.6.5-1 smmanizes the Risk Assessrmt evaluation.
WWTP is expected toe-be a well engineered project and moreover should be
financially sound because of the precious value of the imported water for sustaining
the economy of Shanxi Province. The real risk, actually, is the risk that WWTP might
not get built.

ENVIRONMENAL MONITORINGi
7.1   Description of Moniorlng Program
An essential component of the overall WWTP is its Enviromental Monitoring
Program, which is to cover both the construction and operations stages of the project.
thus covering a period of some 25 years. The monitoring work should begin as soon
as the Environmental Management Office becomes operative. The summarized
monitoring program to be administered by EMO is shown in Table ES 7-1. including
delineation of tasks and costs.
The costs for EMO are setimated at 50 mm per year for a 5-year construction period,
and 33.2 mm per year for a 20-year operation period. For the total of 25 years the total
costs, assuming 8.000 yuan/mm including expenses, will be 7,320,000 yuan or US S
914,000, averaging S 36,560 per year. There will likely be some additional charges by
provincial/city agencies participating in the monitoring, hence total costs may be
average around S 40,000 per year for the 25-year period.
7.2   Management of Monitoring Progrom
The monitoring program is to be managed and supervised by the EMO, with much of
the detailed field work done by the ECls and some by the EMO office staff.
However, other agencies, including the provincial EPB, WRB, and AES, and Taiyum
City are to participate in the field work in accordance with agreements with YRDP.
Costs for and monitoring work by these other agencies, which is outside their normal
scope of monitoring, are to be reimbursed by YRDP.
7.3  Importance of Monitoring Program
Note that the overall monitoring program includes essentially two components. (i)
monitoring to ensure continuing delivery of water to the service area, and (ii)
monitoring to ensure optimal use of the imported (and expensive) water in the service
area, including monitoring of water use and reuse, waste management/water pollution
control, and Fen River water quality.
The monitoring costs are significant but actually very small as related to total WWTP
costs, and the benefit/cost ratio will be large. The monitoring data will be essential for
purposes of optimal water use planning and for this reason will result in large savings
through minimization of water wastage. The monitoring is absolutely essential to the
success of the project.

8.1   Need for Taning
Implementation of WWTP will be a pioneering project for Shanxl Province (and for all of
China) in tumsbain diverion of water on a maisve scalo, for moeeing the critical needs
for more water to support continuing growth and development of parched areas of
northern China. Bocuuq of tOh restively high cost of such importe watr, It is esential
that conventional pnctices on water use, waste treament, water pollution control. and
water cause be reoriented to acheve an integrated comprehensive program which makes
maximum/optimal ue of the precious water for all esential water uses in the service
ar  (Talyun Service Area for Phase I) including domestic, commercial, indusrial, and
agriculturl needs, including balanced use of all frshwater resoure (local surface water,
local groundwater, and Imported water), and Including institutional. legal economic, and
financing u well a egineering aspec. The proposed plan for achieving this is
discusUed in ES Chapter S.
8.2      Recommended Traning
In order to achieve this goal a training progrm  is needed to srengthen the capabilities of
the officials involved in WWTP including YRDP, Shanxi Province, and Local Agencies
in the various new approaches and methodologies  tich will be utilized. The
recommended training program inlcudew two componerni
(a) A specialized training program to be an integral part of the WWTP/Phase I
project. described in the EIA Main Report Chaptr 8. for training of selected staff
of participating Provincial and City agencies.
(b) A traininy program especially for TEPB. because of the many assignments for
which TEPB will have the lead role in preparinglimplementing the recommended
integmted plan. to be financed by Technical Assistance grant of S 2 million (to be
piggy-backed onto the WB Phase I Loan).
8.2.1 Specialized Training for participating Agencies
This program. to cost an cstimated S 438.500. will include training by foreign expcrts of
selected Chinese personnel wiho will then conduct training courses at Taiyuan for stuff rof
participating agencies. plus a visit by one team to Southern California to study integrated
water use technologies developed there over the past four decades and a visit by another
team to the Communicable Disease Center of the USA in Atlanta. GeoLia. Detui Is arc

This program  is described in detail in Annex H oi' the EhA  Main Repon, and is
summarized lere in Figure ES.8-3 This includes provision for establishing a Revolving
Fund for assisting local industries In moving ahead with their own Initiative to
plan/build/operate more elTective production methods which incorporate wati recycling.
water reuse. and waste minimization/clean tecihnologics.
8.3 Value of Training Program
The proposed training program should prove to be onc of the most cost-effective
components of the entire WWTP. Its total cost is small, only a very small percentage of
total first-phase investment cost, but this small investment is essential if the precious
imported water is to be wisely used. It is expected that the training program will result in
morc appropriate planning decisions on investments in facilities and thus result in savings
of tens of millions of dollars over the Phasc I project design lifc period.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMFNT PLAN  EIEMPI
9.1 INTRODUCTION
The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) comprises the institutional arrangement.
particularly the Environmental Management Office (EMO), which Is deslgned to
ensure that all of tie EPMs specified In the EIA, including environmental monitoring,
will be actually cared out.
The overall EMP is illustrated by Figure ES.9-1, 2.3,4.
9.2   Environmental MaDngement Systan
To ensure effective administration of *nvironmental management, the YRDP will
create the Enviromnental Management Lead Group (EMLO) and Environmental
Management Office (EMO), whose combined responsibility is the administration and
implementation of the EMP. The Lead (iroup will be comprised of senior officials of
the YRDP. the provincial environmental agencies, and local agencies that will have
responsibilities for undertaking specific environmental anagement tasks.
In addition YRDP will establish an Expert Panel on Environment (and Resettlement),
comprising distinquish foreign and Chinese expers, which will meet every 6 months
to review YRDP progress in implementing the Phase  's environmental (and
resettement) action progmms.
The scope of work by EMO and Expert Panel is to include periodic review of the
progress of the EMO of MWRs, Wanjiazhai Reservoir Management EMO in
implementing the EPMs specified in the EIA for Wanjiazhai.
9.3 Environmental Management Activities
9.3.1 Project Preparation Phase
During preparation for construction. the YRDP priorities will be:
(a) To arrange for estabilishment of the EMO as promptly as possible.
including staffing with the specialized environmental technology skills
needed for carrying out the EMO duties.
(b) To prepare clauses for tht construction tender documents. including the
emironmental constraints to be observed by the Construction Contractor.
and to ensure that the EPMs specified in the EIA are included in the
project's final planning and design documents.
(c) To plan and initiatc the environmental monitoring progam described in
Chapter 7. including environmental monitoring of resettlement.
(d) To commence the mobilization of the various agencies who xvill participate
in implementing EPMs as described in Chapter 4 and 5. including the
ES.Q - I

rocommended permit system for water use and waste management
including treatment and reuse.
(C) lTo plan and prepare for the Environmental Training Prdigram described in
Chapter 8.
(1) To plan and initiate a comprehensive Public Participation progrm  as
required by Chinese law.
9.3.2 Construction and Operation Phases
lThe mqior priorities during project construction phase will be: (i) monitoring of
conistruction operation. (ii) completion of the Environmental Training Program (if not
completed in the project preparation phase). (iii) continuing of the Public Participation
program  and (iv) working with provincial and local agencies to assist the
iniplemcntation.
The Opramtion Phase will (i) continue the environmental monitoring program, (ii)
continue the Public Participation progrm, and (iii) cooperation with provincial and
local agencies in carrying out all necessary EPMs.
In both the Construction Phase and Operation Phases, the EMO will observe the
actuaI environmental effects of the project. In the event there ar unacceptable
advcrsc cffccts, or promising opportunities for environmental enhancement that have
been overlooked, E1MO will be possiblc to recommend appropriate action.
9.4   EMO Costs and Justification
nhc total costs for the EMO/EMP program are estimated to be approximately S 4.593
million. for a total period of 25.5 years including 0.5 years for pre-construction
activities. 5 years for construction. plus 20 years of operation. This averages about
SI 80.100 per year. This cost represents a very small percentage of the total Phase I
pro.icct cost. and is very much less than wlat is prcticed in Westem countries &br
%irnilar projccts. Experience in the Western countries has shown that the benefit/cost
ratio for this investment is very high because it is essential to ensure that the project
will be economically-cum-eivironmentally sound thereforc sustainable.

SUMMARI AND CONCLU1SI YP%
10.1 EIA TEAM AND REPORT
'lnc EIA has been carried out for YRDP by CIRP/Shanxi University with the
assistance of WB/EIA team mambers. over the period July 1995 to Julv 1996. The
EIA Main Report and the Executivc Summary Report have been prepared in both the
Chinese version (to meet NEPA requirements) and the English version (to meet World
Bank requirements). Both versions use the same Table of Contents and are essentially
the same in substance.
10.2 WORK APPROACH BY EIA TEAM
Tlhe WW'TP/EIA work has (a) reviewed all background documents. (b) met with the
various governmental agencies in Shanxi Province and Taiyuan City who are
concerned with the environmental impacts of WWTP including YRDP, (c) met with
NEPA's EIA officer at Beijing in charge of WWTP/EIA. (d) made a number of field
visits to selected project areas. (e) has had detailed discussions with the WB/YRDP
Mission members visiting at Taiyuan in October 1995. and (f) discussed the EMA
Interim Report with WB officials at Washington D.C. in November 1995.
103  MANAGEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
Figure ES. 10-1 summarizes the environmental impacts of V'W"TP. It (i) lists all of the
SEL c. (ii) quantities each in terms of poLentials for adverse effects if not controlled. of
potentials for benefits with feasiblc controls, and of net effects with these controls.
(iii) shous the EPMs measures which must be taken as part of the feasible control
system. aznd (iv) shows the net environmental effects.
Figure ES.1]0- shows that. assuming proper implementation of EPMs bv the EMO.
WWTP will achieve great environmental benefits with virtually no significant
environemntal losses.
Whilc inattention to the SEIs noted above could result in serious adverse effects if not
properly controlled. the EIA work. including judgment from experience in other major
water resource development projects in China and elsewhere. indicates that it will be
feasible and affordable to manage each issue, by use of mitigation/offsetting/
enhancement measures. so that the net adverse environmental effects of the project
should be negligible x ith net very positive environmental benefits.
To achieve the goal noted above will require establishment of the EMO noted in
Section 9.5. especiallv for realizing the institutional measures needed for achieving
optimal use of the imported w ater. The technologies to be utilized for optimal wvater
use, with wastewater treatment used to produce reusable water. are well established in
the arid/semi-arid regions of the USA like Southem California. but are relatively new

Shanxi Provincc. Morcovcr. the XNWXTP cxperien:e will be a vcrv valuabic guideline
lc'r usc throuughout China in waltei sh!ortage regions.
IFigure ES.10-1 also shows that Ak'WTP is sound rorm the point of view of risk
assessment. The only real riskl for WNVTP is the risl that %'WWTP might Iiot be
impeniented. WWTP is an absolute must for the economics and socio-economics of
the target areas which cannot continuc to develop without imported water. And while
the imported water will be used by municipalities and industries to become
wastewatrs'. these wastcwatcrs themselves will all be very valuable water for (i)
rcusc bY industry. (ii) for recharging of groundwater to gain more water suitable for
domestic use including drinking. and (iii) for irriation. Thus the wastewaters
actually represent per se precious additional water supply. Figure 10-2 is a schematic
drawing showing the water supply/reusc plan.
10.4 XIAOLANGDI EXPERIENCE
Because conditions for the SEls for WWTP are similar in many respects to the SEls
for Xiaolangdi. the pioneering experience of the Xiaolangdi project in managing these
issues (including construction stage problems) fumishes very valuable guidelines for
'WW%ITP/EIA purposes.
10.5 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN AND OFFICE
To achieve the goals noted above. including assurance of optimal use of the expensive
imported water. it is essential for YRDP to establish the EMO with responsibility for
implementing the EMP activities as described in Chapter 9.
A meaningful EMO should be established during the pre-construction period. as soon
as possible. with staffing includign the needed skills in environmental engineering and
technolog,v.
