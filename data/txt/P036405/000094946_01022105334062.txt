CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1   Project Background
1.1.1 Project Concept
The overall Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project (WWTP), which has been under study
for some three decades, is envisioned to comprise the following components:
(i) General Main Line, for delivering water from Wanjiazhai Reservoir to the
South Main Line (included in WWTP/Phase I) and, in a future phase, to
deliver water to the North Main Line.
(ii) South Main Line, for delivering water to the Taiyuan Service Area,
including use of Fen River to deliver water to Fen-l reservoir, and
Connection Works for delivery from Fen-l reservoir to the Taiyuan Service
Area.
(iii)North Main Line, including some new reservoirs, for delivering water to the
Pingshuo and Datong service areas.
The present Phase I project is limited to Item (i) (ii) and excludes the North Main Line.
Figure 1.1.1-1 is a schematic drawing which illustrates the overall project concept and
those components included in Phase I. Figure 1.1.1-2 shows the plan layout of the
V,'VTP in color. The Phase I project will transfer I million m3/day of water to Taiyuan
begining in 2001 and another 0.76 million m3/day by 2004.
1.1.2 Importance of WWTP
The purpose of overall WWTP is to furnish additional water supply for industrial and
municipal use in Taiyuan, Pingshuo and Datong in Shanxi Province. It is a "life"
project of the province and also one of the important development projects of the State
"8th Five-year Plan". As noted above, the Phase I project is limited to furnishing water.
to the Taiyuan Service Area.
Taiyuan is an important energy and chemical base of China. As a result of great
shortage of water, it is now depending on groundwater over-development. At present,
the daily water unavailability is 425,000 m3. Although 225,000 m3/day is made
available by means of groundwater over-development, there is still a gap of 200,000
m3. Extensive over-development of groundwater has enlarged the groundwater funnel
area in the city from 11.2 km2 in the 1960s to 328 km2 in 1993 and has increased the
well depth from 50 m to over 300 m. Up to date, more than 800 wells have dried up
and abandoned. Water has been long supplied at a low pressure and even interrupted in
a total area of 42 km2, which directly affects the livelihood of 400,000 people.The
reconstruction and expansion of a series of large and middle-sized enterprises are
restricted by the shortage of water. At the Lancun water source (a major water
source), the water availability has decreased from 460,000 m3/day in the 1970s to
260,000 m3/d in 1993. Extensive groundwater over development has caused
deterioration of groundwater quality, settlement of ground and surface, unbalance of
l-l

the eco-enviromnent, which endangers human health and environment. It is, thus, very
urgent to seek new water sources for relaxing the critical water shortage in Taiyuan,
and the only feasible solution is to divert water flow from the Yellow River system.
The State Planning Commission (SPC) submitted to the State Council the "Submission
of Review and Approval of the Feasibility Study Report on Wanjiazhai Dam and
W'ater Transfer Project" (Letter No. JNJ87) on January 27, 1993. The submission was
approved by the State Council on February 22, 1993.
1.1.3 Purpose of ELA
The purpose of the present study is to produce an EIA report for the Wanjiazhai Water
Transfer Project (WWTP) as it is currently planned, based on the utilization and
updating of earlier studies of WWTP, which will meet the requirements of MWR,
NEPA, Shanxi EPB, and the World Bank.
1.2 Basis for Preparation of EIA
1.2.1 History of EIA Studies for WWTP
In accordance with th- Environment Protection Law, PRC and the Regulation on
Environment Protection Management of Construction Project, the YRDP has
entrusted the CIRP with prepartion of the EIA of WWTP (GML and NML) and EJA
of the WW7P (ML) which were approved by NEPA as reviewed by MWR.
To make up the project construction cost deficiency, Shanxi Provincial Government
provided the State Council with Submission of WW7P General Schedule and
Financial/Policy Issues Needing to be Solved. In this submission, 150-200 rnillion
USD loan was proposed to be obtained from the WB, the ADB, foreign governments
or other international financial organizations. In September 1993, WWTP was included
by SPC in the candidates for WB loans in the1994-1996 fiscal years.
Five WB missions leaded by Mr. Daniel Gunaradnum visited Shamci for the purpose of
WWTP. These WB mission activities include:
(i) A WB mission which was briefed on the project description on May 22, 1994.
(ii) A project identification mission, which carried out an overall review of the
project planning, design and construction. Also, site visits were made.
(iii) In May 2-26, 1995, the project preparation mission visited WWTP to evaluate
its preparation stage.
(iv) In October 3-22, 1995, the project preappraisal mission had discussions with
the Governent and local agencies about such issues as project scope,
investment, works by International and local competitive bidding, tender
document preparation, EIA, resettlement, etc..
1-2



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiea                                 Final Report
(v) During April 9 to 27, 1996, agreement was reached after detailed discussions
between the project appraisal preparation mission and responsible local
agencies on joint design, connection works, Taiyuan water supply system,
equipment procurement, works by international competitive bidding, water
organization establishment, water pricing reform, supervision engineer, EIA,
resettlement, project cost estimate and construction schedule, and other issues.
It was proposed by this mission to increase the WB loan up to 400 million
USD.
A project appraisal mission is expected to be sent by WB to complete the project
appraisal in September 1996.
On the basis of the NEPA Notice on the Enhancement of EIA Management of
Construction Project Financed by International Financial Organization (Letter No.
H1324 [93]), the YRDP entrusted the CIRP with preparing the WW7'P Environmental
Impact Assessment as required by NEPA for WB financed projects accordingly.
CIRP established an EIA team, composed of key EIA staff members, as described in
Section 1.5. The EIA Terms of Reference for WWTP was completed and submitted to
and approved by NEPA. This TOR is included in Annex B.
1.2.2 EIA Assignment to CIRP
The basis for the EIA assignment, by YRDP to CIRP, comprises the following
documents:
(i) SPC letter No. lWZ1682 (93) which included WWTP in the candidates for WB
loans in 1994-1996 fiscal years.
(ii) Shanxi Provincial Planning Commission letter No. JJW808 (94) entitled
Submission of WWTP Proposal for WB Loan and its supplementary write-up
dated March 7, 1995.
(iii) SPC letter No. JNJ87 (93) entitled Submission of Review and Approval of the
Feasibility Study Report on Wanjiazhai Dam and Water Transfer Project.
(iv) SPC letter No. JNJ250 (93) Notice on the Distribution of "Submissionz of
Review and Approval of the Feasibility Study Report on Wanjiazhai Dam and
Water Transfer Project".
(v) YRDP letter No. JYZ6 (96) entitled Letter of Assignment for EIA Revision
and Amendment.
1.2.3 Laws and Regulations on Environmental Protection
The environmental laws and regulations which were observed in preparing the EIA are
the
following:
1-3



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final Report
(i)    Environment Protection Law, PRC
(ii)   NEPA letter No. GH003 (86) Regulation on Environment Protection
Management of Construction Project.
(iii)   SEPB letter No. JHI (86) Detailed Rules for Compliance with
"Regulation on Environment Protection Management of Construction

Management of Construction Project Financed by International
Financial Organizations.
(v)   Law of Water and Soil Conservation, PRC
(vi)  Shanxi Regulation on Water Pollution in the Fen River Basin.
(vii)  Shanxi Regulation on Environment Protection.
1.2.4 EIA Technical Guidelines
Technical guidelines of PRC utilized for the EIA include:
(i)    Technical Guideliniesfor ETA (HJ/T2.1-2.3-93).
(ii)   Shanxi Specificationfor EJAManagementofConstructionProject or
Trial Use) and detailed rules for the implementation thereof.
(iii)   NEPA Manuals on EIA for major construction projects (Ref. 205).
In addition the EIA team made use of the World Bank's EIA guidelines given In
References 301 and 307.
1.2.5 References Utilized
1.2.5.1 Listing of References
Annex A is a listing of the many references utilized by the ELA team. These include
EIA
studies made for GML, and SML by CIRP in 1993-94 (References 101 and 102) and
for
Connection Works by SIDI in 1995 (Ref. 157)
The present EIA study. is based essentially on the usc of earlier studies/reports as
delineated in Annex A. These earlier studies have produced most of the information
used for the present study, and the role of the present study has been to use this
information together with new data obtained to fill data gaps to produce an EIA which
meets the EIA requirements of NEPA, the Shanxi EPB, and the World Bank.
1.2.5.2 Assessment of References
Figure 1.2.5-1 has been prepared to show, for each reference, the information
contained as related to the various EIA tasks. The figure shows, as expected, that
much information is available fou some tasks but limited data for others. The strategy
1-4



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Project                                  Final Reort
for preparing the present EIA is based on use of these various studies to furnish the
bulk of the needed information, with additional information obtained by the EIA team
from field visits and meetings with various governmental agencies and obtained from
various parts of the ELC/WWTP project report prepared on the engineering design
aspects of the project.
Many of the SEIs involved in WWTP are similar to the SEIs for YRCC's Xiaolangdi
project (Refs. 206 to 210), and the methods used by the Xiaolangdi project for
resolving these issues have furnished valuable guidelines for assisting in planning of
WWTP. This includes environmental management in both design and construction
stages.
1.2.6 EIA Methodology
The basic EIA methodology utilized for the present study is that originally developed
for the Columbia River Project (USA, Reference 302), which classifies environmental
resources into the following categofies:
(a) Natural physical resources
(b) National ecological resources
(c) Economic development resources (farming, urban, industry, infrastructure)
(d) Quality of life resources (social, cultural, archeological public health,
recreational and other values)
Under this procedure, the EIA report assigns one chapter for describing these
environmental resources, and in later chapters the expected impacts on these resources
are delineated and those which are significant (called Significant Environmental Issues
[SETs) are evaluated and appropriate Environmental Protection Measures (EPMs) are
formulated, working in conjunction with the WWTP engineering team.
The EPMs are considered to include (I) mitigation measures, (ii) offsetting measures,
where needed when mitigation is not enough, and (iii) environrnental measures where
appropriate for taking advantage of opportunities to include in the overall project
certain additional components where such inclusion will significantly improve
environment at low cost.
Other EIA methodology reference utilized include the World Bank EIA Handbook
(Ref. 301), and the ADB/EIA manuals (Ref. 305)
1.3   Strategy and Focus for Preparing EIA
1.3.1 EIA Strategy
The ultimate purpose of the WWTP is to provide Taiyuan with Yellow River water of
good quality such that a new water source will be available which is suitable for both
industrial and municipal purposes. Therefore, the EIA has to consider possible project-
related environmental impacts and also such impacts on imported water quality. The
assessment will cover environmental impacts by the project per se, and such impacts
not included in but closely related to the project. Potential environmental effects by
1-5



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final ReDort
other main works, as integral part of the water development project, will be also
considered.
Based on the above statement, the ELA strategy is identified as follows:
(a)   The WWNTP Phase I Project is considered as a whole. In other words,
the EIA will cover both project components to be financed by WB
(GML, SML and Connecting Works for SML) and those not to be
financed by WB (Wanjiazhai Dam, Taiyuan Municipal Water Supply
Project, Taiyuan Waste Management Project). The diverted water will
be treated to satisfy requirements for industrial and municipal purposes.
Industrial wastewater and excreta will be properly managed and
controlled to avoid wastewater discharge polluting the Fen River water
quality.
(b)   ELks for most WWTP components, as locally financed works, have
already been prepared and approved. However, ELAs for these
components have to be resubmitted for review and approval as part of
the new EIA now being prepared for both NEPA and WB. Every effort
has been made to meet both WB and Governmental requirements with
respect to EIA format and content. Issues of special WB concem (for
example, water pollution control, public participation, and resettlernent)
have been discussed and highlighted in separate sections. A complete
EIA covering all WWTP Phase I components has been prepared.
(c)    As noted above, all valuable back-ground studies have been utilized.
(d)   EIA quality assurance has been strengthened. Qualified ELA staff have
been selected to ensure that EIA participants are well aware of
WB/E1A guidelines. and Governmental enviromnental policies, laws and
standards. Close association has been maintained with the staff of
YRDP, for whom the EIA has been prepared.
1.3.2 EIA Highlights
The overall WWTP/Phase I Project comprises basically two components, (i) delivery
of the Yellow River from Wanjiazhai to Taiyuan City, and (ii) implementation of a
comprehensive program for ensuring optimal use of the expensive imported water,
including optimal water use and reuse and use of waste management systems for
promoting maximum reuse and for achieving water pollution control including
maintenance of acceptable water quality in the Fen River both within Taiyuan City and
downstream.
The EIA has highlighted both of these basic issues.

1.4.3 Environmental Protection Objectives
The WWTP construction operations will not involve any cultural relics or natural
reserves. Although the tunnels will go through Mount Guancen, the forests there will
not be impacted.
The main objectives include endurance of continuity of the supply of imported water,
avoidance of water pollution during transfer, mitigation of eco-environmental
destruction during construction and proper restoration of the eco-environment on
completion of construction, and improvement of Taiyuan facilities for use and reuse of
water (including both existing water resources and imported water) and for
management of works to optimize water use/reuse and maintenance of water quality in
the Fen River within and below Taiyuan City.

The project area covers nine counties (district, city), including Pianguan, Pinglu,
Shuozhou, Shenchi, Ningwu, Jingle, Loufan, Gujiao and Taiyuan. These are distributed
in the northwest and midnorth parts of Shanxi Province located in North China. The
geographic location of U'WTP is as shown in Figure 2.1.1 - 1.
The following is a brief description of Shanxi Provincial to give a better understanding
of the areas involved in the project.
Shanxi Province is bordered by Hebei Province in the east with the Taihang Mountain
in between, and separated by the Yellow River from Shaanxi Province in the west and
Henan Province in the south. In the north, it leans against the Great Wall and links with
Inner Mongolia. The province is 670 km from north to south and 370 km from west to
east, taking a shape of a parallelogram with the south-north side being longer as shown
in Figure 2.1.1-2.
The morphology here greatly varies from place to place. In the eastern and western
parts, there is a sequence of mountain chains and hills, with graben basins situated in
the middle. The ground surface fluctuates to such an extent that most of the province,
except the basins in the middle and south parts, has an elevation above 1,000 m. The
summit of Mount Wutai (the maximum peak in North China) has an elevation as high
as 3,058 m. Along the Yellow River flood land area distributed in Yuanqu County,
however, the elevation is only 245 m.
The total land area of the province is 156,267 km2, including 35.7% contributed by
mountain areas, 44.6% by broken country, and 19.7% by plains.
The mean yearly precipitmtion is 524 mm. In most parts of the province, precipitation
ranges between 400 ar.ii n-0 n;m. Most of the southeastern part, mountain areas in the
mideastern part. and Cjuandishan in the Luliang Mountain enjoy more precipitation,
with a yearly value of 600-700 mm. But precipitation in Datong basin, Guanling, Fansi
and Pianguan Counties is less than 400 mm. Precipitation in the province greatly varies
from year to year (by some twice from wet year to dry year). Also, it considerably
varies during the year, with the majority concentrated in the period from July to
September.
With a total population of 30.452 million (1994), the density was 195 inhabitants/km2.
Coal and iron are very rich in the province, with 262.42 billion tons coal and 3.45
billion tons iron deposits. The annual coal and iron production in 1994 was 324 million
tons and 13.414 million tons respectively.
2-1



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                              Final Report
Well developed power industry makes the province a commercial power base of the
country. The annual output in 1994 was 45.693 TWH, with 1.1 TWH exported to
other provinces. The output will reach 100 TWH by the year of 2000, with more than
40 TWH exported to other parts of the country.
Shanxi is remarkable in its productivity producing outstanding and enjoys rich mineral
deposits, but the per capita annual income is at a low level. In 1994, the average wage
of workers was 3,997 yuan (481.6 USD) and the average net income of farm
households was only 884 yuan (106.5 USD). The province is thus an impoverished
part of China.
One of the major reasons for the impoverishment is the worsening shortage of water
which is, in turn, a bottleneckl to harmonious economic development.
2.1.2 Project Concept
The overall WWTP is composed of GML, NEL, SML and Connection Works.
The proposed WB loan proceeds will be applied toward the costs of GML, SML, and
SML Connection Works. The NML works are scheduled to be carried out later. In a
later phase the SML system may include an additional reservoir, the Haoshuigou
Reservoir, but this is not included in Phase I.
In addition, in the EIA process, the Wanjiazhai Dam Project, together with all works
up to water users, should be considered as an overall project. That is to say, all
environmental impacts to be posed by the overall project should be considered. These
include Wanjiazhai Dam Project, the Taiyuan municipal water supply distribution
system, and the Taiyuan municipal sewerage system including treatment and disposal
and reuse facilities, Taiyuan municipal sewerage system.
Figure 1.1.1-1 of Chapter I is a schematic illustration of the overall WWTP project
including Phase I, and Figure 1.1.1-2 is a color plan layout of the WWTP. The
following is a brief discussion of the Phase I project and the additional projects not in
WWTP but included in ESA (Environmental Study Area).
2.1.2.1     WWTP Phase I
(a)   GML
As shown in Figures 1.1.1-1, 2, starting at the intake OD the left bank of Wanjiazhai
dam, the GML goes east to deliver water, through tunnels and 3 pumping stations, to
the SML and NML partition point located at Xiatuzhai Village,?Pianguan County. The
full length of GML is about 44.6 km.
(b)   SML
Starting from the partition point, the SML goes, in the south-east direction, through
Pianguan, Xinhuxinyao VllUage (Zhiniquan Township, Pinglu), Dongdian (Limin
Township, Sucheng District), Werding Village (Shenchi County), and Shijieshang,
2-2



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Project                                  Final Report
Fenshuiling and Matouying (Ningwu County). Imported water is delivered through
tunnels, aqueducts, and inverted syphons. The total length is approximately 102.9 km.
(c)    Connection Works
After flowing out of the SML tunnel terminal at Toumaying, imported water is led to
the Fen River and delivered to Fen-I reservoir via the natural river channel. Then, it is
sent to Huyan treatment plant via 40.7 km twin pipelines and 16.8 km twin tunnels.
2.1.2-2      Additional Projects
(a)    Wanjiazhai Dam Project
Wanjiazhai Dam Project is located in Pianguan, Shanxi Province. It has a maximum
storage level of 980 m and a total storage capacity of 896 million m;. The principal
objectives include water supply, power generation, as well as flood and ice-jam
control. A project EIA was completed by TIDI in November 1989.
(b)   Taiyuan Municipal Water Supply Distribution System
This system provides imported water, after purification in the treatment plant, for
users via distribution mains and pipelines.
(c)    Taiyuan Sewerage System
This component intersects and collects municipal sewage which is then treated to be
reused for industrial/agricultural purposes or discharged into the Fen River.
2.2    Need for WWTP
2.2.1 Evaluation of Shanxi Water Resources
Natural precipitation is the main source of water recharge in Shanxi. Based on the
mean annual precipitation of 524 mm, it is known that the total precipitation volume is
.9 biiiion m3. The average annual water resources amount to 14.08 billion m,
including 10.87 billion m3 surface water (river runoff) and 3.21 billion m3 groundwater
availability.
As calculated on the basis of the total provincial population 27.7441 million in 1990,
the per capita water availability is 507.5 m3, which is only 20% of the national average.
On the basis of the total farmland area of 3.6925 million ha in 1990, the water
availability per unit farmland is 3,813 Mm3/ha, which is 14.6% of the national average
26,130 m3/ha.
2.2.2 Development and Use of Shanxi Water Resources
Shortage of water mark-edly affects industrial/agricultural production and people's
livelihood.
2- 3



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                 Final Revort
There is about 1.1667 million ha irrigated land, amounting to 31.6% of the total
farmland area in the province. As analyzed by water agencies, no more than 20% of the
irrigated land is provided with adequate irrigation water, 63% is accessible to irrigation
water far less than required, and the rest 17% is irrigated land in name only. Water
consumption for domestic purposes of rural residents is only 36 I/d. It is still very
difficult to get drink}ing water in some remote areas.
In urban areas, domestic water consumption is 74 lId, less than the minimum level of
100 l/d as recommended by the WHO and also far below the national average of 174
l/d.
As a coal, energy, and chemical base of the country, SharDi has many industries with
high water demands. Water for industrial needs is concentrated on power, coal,
chemical, and metallurgical activities. These four sectors account for 74% of the total
water take for industrial needs in the province. Industrial water supply is far from
adequate. In 1992, water availability for industrial purposes was only 58% of the water
demand. Due to the lack of water, some factories are forced to limit their productivity.
At Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, cooling water has been cut down to the warning
level, with risks for high furnaces to be shut down. In some mining areas inspected by
Datong Mining Service Bureau, people have to use mine water as drinking water. Lack
of water supply has deferred commissioning of the completed Yanzishan and Sitaigou
mines.
Although 225,000 m3 groundwater is over exploited on a daily basis, there is still a
shortage of 200,000 m3. As a result water is supplied on a low-pressurefintermittent
service basis.
2.2.3 Essential Solution to Water Shortage
On the principle of ensuring adequate water for livelihood needs and also tak-ing
account of industrial and agricultural needs, areas suffering from water shortages
mainly include: Datong economic center, Sangganhe region where Suzhou coal and
power base is located; Taiyuan economic center, upper and middle reaches of the Fen
River where Fenxi coal and power base is located; lower reaches of the Fen River
where Houlin industrial zone and Hexiang bauxite, coal, and 1 :\ er base are situated;
and Sushui River region with the Yuncheng grain and cotton production base.
Based on statistical data, the total water take for industrial and agricultural needs in
1993 was 5.576 billion m3, including 2.106 billion m3 from river runoff and 3.47 billion
m3 from groundwater.
The annual water shortage in the above mentioned areas is estimated to be about 1.2 to
1.5 billion rn3.
What is the way out to deal with this situation?
With the existing water supply facilities, the province river runoff utilization is about
30%. Along the upper and middle reaches of the Fen River, Sanggan River and Sushui
2-4



Waaniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final Repot
River, the value has reached 50-70%, greatly exceeding the allowed capacity of river
runoff. As a result, river channels have become "sewage ditches".
The ever-increasing conflict of runoff supply and demand results in competition of
groundwater over-exploitation for industrial and agricultural needs. This over-
exploitation lowers down the water table from year to year such that extensive
groundwater funnel areas are produced. In addition, groundwater resources
destruction contributed by coal mining activities (causing at least water resources
reduction by 200 million m3) puts the water crisis in a worse position.
Any effort to meet the province water demand by increasing use of surface water and
groundwater will meet costly and insurmountable difficulties. Being affected by
precipitation, surface water is highly seasonable and the majority of the still available
surface water is distributed in the southeastern part of the province, far away from the
major demand centers in the north and midnorth.
As discussed in the previous paragraphs, it is obvious that the first solution to deal
with the water shortage problem is to provide more input and to implement the WWTP
at a full scale. This will provide a much increased water supply capacity, satisfy the
province sustainable social and economic development, and relax the conflict between
water demand for construction of energy/chemical bases and the inadequate water
resources affordability.
2.3   Project Components
Project components include components of WWTP Phase I and components of
additional projects.
2.3.1 WWTP Phase I
2.3.1.1 General Main Line (GML)
Starting at the intake on the left bank of Wanjiazhai dam, the GML travels eastward to
deliver water, through 2 underground and I surface pumping stations, to the SML and
NML partition point (at El 1,286 m) located in the vicinity of Xiatuzhai Village,
Pianguan County. The full length of GC \TL is about 44.6 km, with design discharge
being 48 m3/s.
(a)   Headwork Diversion
One pressure pipeline 192.93 m long and one pressure tunnel 211.21 m long (f4 m for
both) will be built at El 948 m of the dam. These are then combined to convey
imported water, through a f3.6 m pressure tunnel 1. I km long, to the primary pumping
station forebay.
(b)   Pumping Station
The primary pumping station, located in Daqing Gully, is an underground one with 10
vertical-type pumps equipped in the main pump house. Presenting an installed capacity
2-5



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final Repnrt
of 12 MW and design lift of 142 m, each of these pumps provides a flow discharge of
6.45 m3/s.
The secondary pumping station, located near Shentongzui Village, has identical type
and design parameters.
The tertiary pumping station is situated in cascade 2 terrace on the Pianguan River,
about 700 m east of Yantousi Village and immediately adjacent to Pianguan-Pinglu
highway. The main pump house is furnished with 16 vertical-type pumps, each having
an installed capacity of 4 MW, design head of 80 m, and discharge of 4 m3/s.
(c)   Water Conveyance Structure
The conveyance system is composed of 11 tunnels and 4 aqueducts, with a grand
length of 43.5 kIn, circular (f5.46 m) or circular-arch stalk (5 x 5.5 m) section. Out of
these tunnels, 5 are in pressure vith a total length of 3.6 km and the remaining 6 are
free flow with a total length of 38.8 km. The aqueducts have a total length of 0.543
km. Generally, the geographic conditions along the tunnel alignmnent are rather good
due to a generalized presence of limestone and dolostone over 94% of the total length.
The remaining part is mostly made of soil (loess and laterite). At the full tunnel length,
the water table is generally below the tunnels themselves.
Being separately located in West Shamaogou, East Shamaogou, Shuiquanhe and
Dongxiaogou, these aqueducts are respectively 60, 90, 327 and 57 m long.
(d)   Reservoir
A small reservoir (Shentongzui reservoir) is planned to be built at a place a little
further downstream of the secondary pumping station, allowing daily regulations for
the primary and secondary stations with a regulating capacity of 108,000 m3. The
reservoir area is dolomite. In order to reduce water seepage, 15 cm thick concrete will
be placed on the reservoir bed, with curtain grouting provided for the dam foundation
for the purpose of seepage prevention.
2.3.1.2 South Main Line (SML)
The SML starts from the partition point at Xiatuzhai Village and moves southward
through Pianguan, Pinglu, Shuozhou, Shenchi and Ningwu Counties, with a total
length of 102.9 km. It is composed of 16 structures which convey the imported water
in a close mode at the full length. The design flow is 25.8 m3/s. Imported water, when
lifted up to El 1,482.6 m with two outdoor pumping stations, is conveyed into the Fen
River through a free-flow tunnel.
(a)   Water Conveyance Structure
The conveyance system consists of a diversion gate, 7 tunnels, 3 aqueducts, 2
embedded culverts and I inverted syphon.
(a. 1) Tunnel
2-6



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect -                             Final Report
Tunnels No. 1-7 arranged from north to south are the main works of the SML
conveyance system, with a length of 98.47 km, being 95.7% of the total SML
length. The section size is 4 x 4.24 m or 3.8 x 4.15 (4.19) m. All are free flow.
The 66 km tunnels north of Shijieshang are mainly aligned in Cambrian system
and Ordovician system limestone which is mostly Class I, II, or III surrounding
rock with good stability, and is generally above the water table except that a
small part is arranged in soils.
The 32 km alignments south of Shijieshang are placed in Carbonic and Jurassic
sandstone, shale and mudstone which are relatively weak. A part of tunnel is
more than 300 m below the ground. The water table here is relatively high,
with abundant groundwater. This part (tunnel No. 7) is proposed to be treated
with pre-jet grout during construction.
Out of these 7 tunnels, 3 are extremely long, with tunnel No. 5 being 26.76 km,
No. 6 being 14.47 km and No. 7 being 43,34 kin.
(a.2) Aqueduct
Three aqueducts are separately located at Pianguanhe, Longxugou and
Xipinggou, with a separate length of 847.13, 224 and 370 m, and section size
of 4x 3.85 m.
(a.3)  Culvert
Two culverts are separately located at Muguagou and Wenlingcun upstream of
the Zhujia River, one is 350 m and the other is 730 m long.
(a.4) Inverted Syphon
A inverted syphon is placed between tunnel 3 outlet and secondary pumping
station forebay, being 90.6 m in length and 3.5 m in diameter.
(b)   Pumping Station
SML has primary and secondary pumping stations.
The former station is located in the floodland area south of Xiatuzhai, on the left bank
of the Pianguan River. It connects to Pianguanhe aqueduct in the upstream, 1.8 km
from the partition point, and with tunnel 2 in the downstream. The ground-type pump
house is equipped with 8 x 7.5 MW units, providing an installed capacity of 60 MW.
Each of the units, with a design head of 142 m, provides 4.3 m3/s flow.
The latter station is located at Xihuxinyao Village in Zhiniquan Township, Pinglu
County, 6.3 km away from the primary station. Both installed capacity and layout are
identical to those of the former, with design head also being 142 m.

2.3.1.3 SML Connection Works
Phase I SML Connection Works starts from the tunnel outlet at Toumaying. Through
the natural Fen River channel and Jingle County, it leads imported water to Fen-I
reservoir built in Loufan County. Then it conveys water, through twin pipelines and
twin tunnels in Gujiao City, to Huyan treatment plant. Fen-l reservoir allows
regulation of the imported water. During August-September period, water diversion
will suspend for sediment flushing operations of Wanjiazhai reservoir, and Fen-I
reservoir will provide some 57 million m3 water for Huyan water treatment plant,
which is not included in WWTP.
The following is a description of Phase I SML Connection Works (also discussed in
Section 4.13).
(a)   Natural River Course
The Fen River section from Toumaying to Fen reservoir is 81.2 kin, with broad valley
and straight course. Class I alluvial terrace is well developed. The water table on both
banks is higher than the water levels of the Fen River and its tributaries which are,
therefore, contributed by groundwater. All larger tributaries originate from
metamorphic rocks, intersecting strata and joining the Fen River. Generally speaking,
there is no risk of river channel seepage.
(b)   Fen-] Reservoir
This reservoir is located in Loufan County in the upper reaches of the Fen River. It
was started in 1958 and put into operation in June 1961, involving a total catchmnent
area of 5268 kin2. In this catchment area, larger tributaries include Lan, Dongnian,
Mingshui and Loufan. The maximum reservoir surface area is 32 kin2, with maximum
backwater length of 18.3 km. The upper reaches of the Fen River is 122 km, with a
gradient of 4.5%.
Principal tasks of this reservoir include flood control, water supply for irrigation,
industrial and municipal needs, plus power generation and fishery. It is a multipurpose
carry-over storage. The overall project is composed of dam, spillway, water-carrying
tunnel, power house, flood and sediment tunnels. The total storage capacity is 721
million rn3. The reservoir has been operating in the mode of "storing clear water and
discharging muddy water". Up to date, it has retained 330 million in3 sediment.
(c)   Intake Structure
Provided that Fen reservoir is used to provide regulations for the connecting system, a
layered intake tower needs to be added, providing a design flow of 20.5 m3/s. The
intake gate is connected to a f2 im pressure tunnel 446.8 m long, and then to f2.5 m
power and conveyance penstock. The existing power house is to be expanded, with a
new 10 MW generating unit added. Also, a tail bay will be provided. Water will be
conveyed from the culvert downstream of the tailbay to the pressure forebay at the
water conveyance pipe inlet.
2-8



Waniiazhai Water Transfcr Proiect                               Final Renort
(d)   Water Conveyance Pipe/Tunnel
From Fen reservoir, imported water will be conveyed through twin pipelines and twin
tunnels, without any provision of power station. At the fill length of 57.356 km, there
will be arranged 7 pressure tunnels 16.571 km (with section size of 2.2, 2.4 or 2.6 m)
and 6 water conveyance pipes 40.209 km (with section diameter of 2.2 or 2.4 m), plus
associated structures including 7 valve chambers, 76 manholes, 134 vent shafts, 6
depressure tanks at 3 different places, I pressure forebay, 2 plunge pools, 17 check
sluice gates, 4 overflow weirs and 2 electric butterfly valves.
2.3.2 Additional Projects Not in WWTP but Included in ESA
2.3.2.1 Wanjiazhia Dam Project
Wanjiazhai Dam Project is not included in the WWTP, though, it needs to be discussed
as it is the beginning component for WWTP.
This dam project is located on the upper north main stem of the Yellow River, with
Pianguan county on the left banki and Sungar County (Inner Mongolia) on the right.
The main objectives are water supply and power generation, plus flood and ice-jam
control.
With a total storage capacity of 895 million m3, the reservoir will provide 200 million
m3 water for Inner Mongolia and 1,200 million m3 for Shanxi each year. The installed
capacity will be 1,080 MW (6 Francis turbines), producing an annual output of 2,652
GWH. The operation mode will be "storing clear water and discharging muddy water".
Sediment flushing will be arranged in August and September.
Above the dam site, there is a catchment area of 394,800 km2. The channel gradient
here is 1.24%, and the river width is 300-400 m, with a U-shape valley. Bed rocks are
exposed on the river bed. Floodland on both banks is composed of sand and gravel
deposits. The long-term annual mean runoff at the damsite is 19.2 billion m3. As
checked using 10,000-year flood, the corresponding maximum discharge is 21,200
m3/s. The design sediment content is averaged at 7.21 kg/m3.
The dam is of a concrete gravity type, with a height of 90 m and r vsi !ength of 438 m.
The rock foundation is generally dolomite, limestone, shale and mudstone. The design
normal storage level is 977 m, with a maximum of 980 m (lasting about 10 days each
year).
In addition to water intakes and generating units, the control system also includes
discharge structures, namely, 8 low-level pressure gates (4 x 6 m), 4 middle-level
pressure ones (4 x 8 m) and I high-level outlet (14 m).
2.3.2.2 Taiyuan Municipal Water Supply Distributin System
When imported water is made available to Taiyuan, water supply for the city will be
increased by I million m3/d in 2001 and then by other 0.76 rnillion m3/d in 2004, far
2-9



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final Renom
beyond the present capacity of existing water supply systems which, therefore, needs
to be upgraded.
(1)   Treatment Plant
The new treatment plant is proposed to be located at Huyan Village in the north
outskirts of Taiyuan. This plant, with a design capacity of 1.76 million m3/d, will be
carried out in two stages. In Stage 1, 1 million m3/d will be provided, and the restO0.76
million m3/d will be completed in Stage II when the total water supply will reach the
design capacity of 1.76 million m3/d.
The treatment process includes precipitation with flocculent (polyacrylamide and basic
aluniinum chloride) and disinfection using ammonia chloride. Main structures are water
distribution well, radial-flow presedimentation tank, horizontal sedimentation tank, air-
water backflush filter chamber, and clear water chamber, etc.
(2)   Distribution Pipeline
Distribution pipelines include distribution mains, pipelines for exclusive use (Taiyuan
Chemical Group and Taiyuan Power Plant 2), and pipe networks. Phase I pipelines
have a total length of 113 km, and those included in Phase n1 have a length of 66.25
km.
(3)   Pressure Station
Three pressure stations are planned at pipe network borders, namely, Dongshan,
Beiying and Xishan pressure stations, to provide water for far and remote parts of
Taiyuan.
Facilities to be provided for these stations include pump houses, power transformation
and distribution chambers, regulation water tanks, suction wells, complex office
buildings and boiler houses, etc. Equipment will be provided, as appropriate, in line
with the scope of service areas and water supply quantities.
2.3.2.3 Tiayuan Municipal Seweage System
The discharge of industrial and domestic wastewater will go up as imported water
reaches Taiyuan. Accordingly, sewage treatment capacity needs to be increased and
water pollution control improved.
To this end, 15 sewage receiving zones are identified. Also, it is planned to expand and
upgrade the existing 5 treatment plants and to provide 7 new ones up to the year of
2020, plus provision of 1,165.5 km sewage mains (see Chapter 5 for details).

2.4   WWTP Phasing and Progress
2.4.1  WWTP Phasing
The overall WWTTP plan includes Phase I and Phase II.
Phase I includes all civil works and water conveyance structures involved in GML,
SMIL and Connection Works, quarter electromechanical equipment for GML pumping
stations, and half electromechanical equipment for SML pumping stations. All these
will be completed by 2001.
Phase II is expected to cover the remaining electromechanical equipment for GML and
SML pumping stations, Haoshuigou reservoir included in SML and other facilities as
needed.
2.4.2 WWTP Progress
(a)   Wanjiazhai Dam Project
River diversion was started upon the closure of Phase II cofferdam and the removal of
Phase I cofferdam on November 7, 1995. As of March 25, 1996, concrete placement
was started in zones 1-9 of the main dam, and zone 11 was raised to El 915 m.
Excavation in the power house and tailrace was completed, with a maximum depth
down to El 882 m.
Embankment of Phase II upstream cofferdam reached El 914 m, while the downstream
cofferdam was almost completed to be ready for the upcoming ice jam.

2.5    Project Alternatives
2.5.1 Alternatives to Wanjiazhai as Water Source
If economic growth in the Project Areas is to continue, and the urban population is to
receive adequate supplies of water, additional sources of water must be found.
Potential sources include (a) groundwater, (b) local surface water, (c) imported surface
water, and (d) reallocation of existing water from other uses (irrigation). These are
discussed as follows:
(a)    Groundwater
Groundwater, in Datong and Taiyuan, is already seriously over-exploited, and has been
since the late 1980s. The evidence comes from both a comparison of extractions with
estimates of sustainable yields, and from observations of declining water tables and
increasing incidence of land subsidence. In 1993, groundwater overdraft in Datong was
40% higher than sustainable yield, and in Taiyuan, 15%. Groundwater supplied 86.7%
of total consumption in Datong in that year, and 80.4% in Taiyuan.
The question is not whether increased extraction of groundwater can be tolerated, but
whether current levels can be sustained to the year 2001 when the Project water is
scheduled to become available.
(b)   Local Surface Water
Taiyuan City is situated near the upper end of the Upper Fen Basin, an enclosed
hydrological entity which relies almost entirely on. snowmelt and far upper reach runoff
for the river flow. There is negligible offtake above Taiyuan City and its northern
suburbs, but. virtually unlimited demand for water in and around Taiyuan and
downstreamn for irrigation. The utilization rate has been as high as 74% in recent years,
which is probably the highest in the Yellow River Basin, and cannot be increased given
the seasonality of flows and high sediment content during flood periods. This level of
utilization has resulted in the river bed often running dry much of the year, and a
dramatic decline in the irrigation supplies to downstrean farmers.
Furthermore, there is strong evidence that recorded Fen River flows have been
declining at statistically-significant rates. This has been caused by ex-tensive terracing
(to conserve water and lessen erosion) upstream, and by the decline in groundwater
tables which increases losses from seepage.

Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                 Final Renort
(c)   Imported Surface Water
The alternative sources for importing surface water are either from adjacent sub-basins
within Shanxi, or from the Yellow River. Figure 2.5.1-1 shows that Shanxi is divided
into 15 sub-basins or catchment areas. Conceivably, Taiyuan could receive water
diverted from the North-West or Hotuohe basins, and Pingshuo and Datong could
receive water from the Honghe and Yanghe basins respectively. Two factors make
these options virtually impossible. First, water shortages are prevalent throughout
northern Shanxi, and are intensifying everywhere. Only in the West is excess surface
flows projected, and these occur mostly in flood season drainage directly to the
Yellow, at points remote from the Project Area water demand centers. Second, the
division of Shanxi into sub-basins follows the pattern of intervening mountain ranges
which would need to be crossed if water were to be diverted. These ranges are as high
as 3,000 m and would involve insurmountable technical and economic difficulties.
The above discussion shows that only importation of water from the Yellow by a
project such as Wanjiazhai can meet the projected water demands. Alternatives neither
can supply the volumes required, or would pose even greater difficulties and higher
costs than Wanjiazhai. An another question is, is Wanjiazhai the best location on the
Yellow for the diversions? Studies have shown that it is the only location which is
feasible. Above Wanjiazhai the Yellow River turns westward, requiring longer and
more costly diversion route, and one which encroaches on Inner Mongalia. Below
Wanjiazhai, the Loess Plateau begins with its associated runoff with very high silt
concentrations which would create many problems in the diversion system.
(d)   Reallocation of Existing Water
In 1993, irrigation accounted for 40 mcm (21.4% of total consumption) in Datong and
83 mcm (19.0%) in Taiyuan. Irrigation consumption as a percentage of total
consumption has been declining as water has been diverted to municipal and industrial
uses or sold by farmers who have water rights.
However, not all of the current irrigation supplies could be diverted to municipal and
industrial (M&I) uses in the Project Areas. Irrigation demands are seasonal, peaking in
the Spring months, whereas M&I demands are relatively constant throughout the year.
The larger irrigated areas are not located near the cities, so that reallocation would
require investments in both surface water storage and conveyance. Those irrigated
areas located near the Project cities supply important and valuable produce to those
cities, supplies which would be difficult and costly to procure elsewhere. But the most
important reason why reallocation from irrigation should not be pursued has to do with
poverty alleviation. Most of Shanxi's poor are rural, and most rural residents rely on
agriculture for the bulk of their incomes. Without irrigation, agriculture in Shanxi is a
precarious undertaking because of low and unpredictable rainfall. Irrigated yields are
double those for rained land, and could be much higher were irrigation water available
in ample supplies. Agricultural incomes are probably quadrupled when crops can be
irrigated. In 1994, farm wages were only 33% of wages in manufacturing. Thus any
further re-allocation of water from farmers would have serious negative income effects
on this group which is already the'poorest of Shanxi.

2.5.2 Transmission System Routing
As early as the 1950s, an joint engineering team was established, by the Beijing
Investigation and Design Institute of the formner MWR and Shanxi Province, to study
Yellow River diversion alignments. Based on surveys and route selection efforts over
the past 3 decades, the current alignment determined on the basis of many
justifications. Construction work has been carried out, step by step, along GML and
SM'.
2.5.3 SML Connection Works
As explained in Section 4.13 of Chapter 4, "Connection Works", four alternatives were
considered for conveying the imported water from the end of SML Tunnel No. 7 to
Taiyuan City (see Figure 1.1.1-1). As explained in Section 4.13, "Alternative 2" was
selected as the most feasible solution for Phase I. This plan makes use of the 81.2 km
natural Fen River course to convey the imported water from the end of SML Tunnel
No. 7 to the existing Fen-I reservoir and then utilizes pipelines and tunnels to convey
the water from Fen-l reservoir to Taiyuan, thus avoiding use of the Fen River for
conveyance from Fen- 1 reservoir to Taiyuan. This avoids problems of significant water
losses in this river reach due to leakage, and avoids the hazard of significant pollution
runoff into this reach because of difficulties in controlling this.
2.5.4 "Do Nothing" Alternative
With current water shortages in the Project Areas amounting to 40% of estimated
demand, and growing rapidly, and both ground and surface water supplies declining,
failure to complete the WWTP would engender economic, social, and environmental
calamity. Projections using the Provincial Planning Model (PPM) show that if the
Project Areas' urban residents are to be given supplies equaling the norms for China,
and if farmers' water allocations are to be preserved at current levels, industrial and
mining activities would decline rapidly and virtually cease after the year 2010. The
annual loss in industrial output would be 32 billion yuan in 2000, and 66 billion in
2010. The impact would be felt throughout China given the heavy reliance on northern
Shanxi's coal, heavy industry, and chemical output. Hundreds of thousands of skilled
workers would need to be relocated, any vast quantities of mineral and fossil resources
would go unexplored. It is not surprising that Chinese planners have mentioned the
possibility that Taiyuan and Datong would need to be relocated (at incalculable cost) if
WWTP water is not forthcoming. The PPM also shows that sufficient water could be
extracted from irrigation in northern Shand given significant investments in water
storage and conveyance, but probably at a cost for engineering works exceeding that
of WWTP. There would be other prohibitive economic and social costs associated with
this policy. Already low agricultural incomes would be severely affected, and a million
or more agricultural workers would need to be relocated and retrained. Alternative
sources of food supplies would need to be found, and the transportation and
distribution network expanded and reorganized. Even so, the volumes of water that
could be reallocated from this option would be exhausted long before the horizon of
the WWTP planning period of 2020.

CHAPTER 3
ENV1RONMENTAL SETTING
3.1   I[NTRODUCTION
Figure 1.2.5-1 of Chapter I shows that the earlier studies by various Chinese Institutes
do include considerable information on the existing environment. This has been
supplemented by the work of the overall EIA team, including information on natural
physical resources (geology, hydrology) and on socio-economics, obtained from
various local officials and World Bank- project mission members.
Chapter 3 delineates the "Environmental Study Area" (ESA), that is, the area expected
to be significantly affected by the project, and describes the existing environmental
resources in the ESA following the classification system noted in Section 1.2.4-1 of
Chapter 1. The sequence of presentation is the following for the overall project area:
* Section 3.2: ESA base maps.
* Section 3.3: Land uses (covering all types of uses described in Section
3.4 to 3.7).
* Section 3.4: Natural Physical resources including climate, soils geology,
surface water, groundwater, etc.
* Section 3.5: Natural ecological or biological resources including
forests, aquatic ecology, and terrestrial wildlife.
- Section 3.6: Development resources including agriculture, settlements,
infrastructure, and industry.
- Section 3.7: Quality of life resources including socio-economics, public
health, cultural values, archeological monuments,
recreational resources, etc.
In addition the EIA Task for the individual reservoirs (Task 4.8) includes more detailed
descriptions for the EIAs for each reservoir, and the Connection Works (Task 4.13)
include more detailed descriptions for the Connection Works.
3.2   ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY AREA (ESA)
3.2.1 Overall Environment Study Area of WWTP
The overall ESA of WWTP as shown in Figure 3.2.1-1 includes the areas subject to
significant impacts from the overall WWTP project. Because the WWTP comprises
several components as described in Chapter 2, the overall ESA comprises 6 sub-ESAs
namely: Wanjiazhai reservoir, General Main Line, South Main Line, Fen-I Reservoir,
Connection Works, and Taiyuan Service Area. The present study does not include the
North Main Line and associated reservoirs and service areas.
3.2.2 Project Component ESAs
3- I



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project                              Final Report
The overall ESA for WWTP Phase I includes consideration of the following WWTP
project components:
(a) Wanjiazhai Reservoir
Wanjiazhai Reservoir is the water source of WWTP and its dam is presently being
constructed by MWR_ Though the reservoir is not a component of WWTP, its dam
stability, water availability, water quality, etc. will have significant impacts on WWTP.
The ESA of Wanjiazhai Reservoir is defined as the area of the reservoir and its
surrounding area which extends along 72 km of the Yellow River valley and adjacent
hills and mountains from the dam site to Dayushu Village of Qingshuihe County in
Inner Mongolia, as shown in Figure 3.2.2-1.
(b) General Main Line (GML)
As described in Section 2.2, Chapter 2, the GML comprises tunnels, aqueducts,
pumping stations and a small reservoir, namely Shentongzui reservoir, which is in a V-
erosion gully with storage capacity of only 183,000 cu.m and daily regulating capacity
of 108,000 cu.m for the project and therefore will have no significant impacts on
surrounding environment. Hence the ESA of GML is within the strip area along the
main line with a total width of 2,000 m (1,000 m on each side) as shown in Figure
3.2.2-2.
(c) South Main Line (SML)
The SML mainly comprises aqueducts, pipes, siphons, and pumping stations. The ESA
of SML is also within the strip area along the SML with a total width of 2,000 m
(1,000 m on each side) as shown in Figure 3.2.2-3.
(d) Fen-I Reservoir
This is the existing Fen-l Reservoir, adapted to suit WWTP purposes. Its ESA
includes the Fen-l Reservoir area and the area along the Fen River reach from the
SML outlet to the Fen-l Reservoir as shown in Figure 3.2.24.
(e) Connection Works
The Connection Works (CW) refers to the project component which will convey water
from Toumaying, the outlet of Tunnel No.7 of SML, to Huyan Water Treatment Plant
(HWTP) of Taiyuan City. Because of the part of the Connection Works from
Toumaying to Fen-] Reservoir is included in the ESA for Fen-I Reservoir (Figure
3.2.2-4), and the engineering work of CW starts from Fen-I Reservoir and end at
HWTP, the ESA for CW only includes the area along the pipelines and Tunnels from
Fen-] Reservoir to HWTP with a total width of 2,000m (1,OOOm on each side) as
show in Figure 3.2.2-5.
(f) Taiyuan Service Area

Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project                                 Final Report
The WWTP Phase I will supply diverted water to Taiyuan City downtown area and its
suburb area. This will affect the water supply system and the drainage system in the
areas as well as the water quality of Fen River in Taiyuan and downstream. Therefore,
the ESA for Taiyuan service area includes Taiyuan downtown area, suburb areas and
the Fen River reach downstream of Taiyuan as shown in Figure 3.2.2-6
3.3    Land Uses
3.3.1 General Information
The Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project (WWTP) stretches over the northwest part of
Shanxi Province with a chain of undulating hills, crossed gullies, bare mountains, and
fragmented loose plateau (Figure 2.1.1-1). The areas of concem for EIA consists of
the buffer zone along the transmission lines, the areas around Fen- I Reservoir, the area
around the Connection Works, and the Taiyuan Service Area.
The land use in this area can be categorized into farmnland, gardenplot, forest,
grassland, residential and industrial area, infrastructure, water area and wasteland area
as listed in Table 3.3.1-1. The land use in the project areas has been deeply affected by
the natural environmental conditions, long-term human activities, and current
economical capability.
3.3.2 Forests and Wildlife
Due to human encroachment the original forests have disappeared from the project
ESAs. Most of the area is covered with bushes and thick-grown bush grass. Forest
exists in a very small percentage of the whole area. Arbor trees in large numbers are
found only in Luliang and in the Wutai mountains. In the reservoir areas cultivated
crops become the dominant plants.
Poor quality of vegetation limits the living environment of wildlife, and the wild
animals in the area are relatively short in quantity and limited in species as discussed in
detail in Section 3.5.3. It is estimated that there are 150 species of vertebrates
including 17 fishes, 3 amphibians, 5 reptiles, 90 birds, and 26 mammals. Felis Pardus,
Aquila Chrysaetos, Ciconia nigra, and Crossoptilon mantchuricum are the only four
national first-protection animals in the ESA, and they exist only in the remote thickly-
forested mountain areas or on steep precipices and cliffs..
3.3.3 Summary Tabulation
Land uses in WV'TP area are summarized in Table 3.3. 1 - I.
3.4    Natural Physical Resources
3.4.1 General Description
The WWTP is located in northwest part of Shanxi Province. The overall project passes
through Pianguan, Shouzhou, Shenchi, Ningwu and Loufan, Gujiao and Taiyuan
3 - 3



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project                                Final Report
Counties (cities). The project also passes though Luliang Mountain, the west part of
which is in the Yellow River basin.
As shown in Figure 1. I. I - 1, the diverted water is routed from the Yellow River valley
in the west to the Fen River basin in the south by the General Main/South Main Lines
and the Connection Works.
The main rivers in the areas of WWTP are the Pianguan River, Hong River, and Fen
River of the Yellow River Basin,
The following subsections describes briefly the present natural physical resources in the
areas along the Main Lines. The present natural physical resources of the reservoirs
and Connection Works in the ESA are described separately in Section 4.8 and Section
13. Because the Taiyuan service areas only receive additional water from WWTP, the
EIA concerns in this area are limited to water quality, water supply, uses and balance,
wastewater treatment and pollution control, and water quality. These aspects are
described in Chapter 5.
3.4.2 Climate
3.4.2.1  General
The climate of the project region is that of a temperate, seasonal, continental zone. Dry
and windy, the region has a drought rate of 9 years out of every 10 years with most
serious drought in springs. The average annual precipitation is 410-480 mm with
significant yearly and seasonal variations.
Most of the annual precipitation falls in July-September. The weather in summer,
affected by the subtropical anticyclone on the West Pacific, is dry and hot with
annual surface water evaporation of 2,000 mm of which about half is in the period of
April-June. The weather in winter, controlled by the cold anticyclone from Mongolia,
is dry, cold, windy and dusty with very little rain or snow.
The average annual temperature in the region is 4.6 - 9.0 C. The average
temperature difference between different years is little but the temperature difference
within a year are significant, usually about 400 C, with the highest 380C and the lowest
-3 1°C.The average annual wind velocity is 2.2-4.2 m/s with maximum 29.7 m/s. The
maximum depth of frozen earth is 192 cm and the maximum snow depth is 26 cm. The
four seasons in the region are clearly distinguished with longer winters and shorter
springs and autumns (Ref. 113).
3.4.2.2 Regional Data
The WWTP P: ve I involves nine counties (cities, districts) in the province, namely
Pianguan, Ping-, Shuozhou, Shenchi, Ningwu, Jingle, Loufan, Gujiao and Taiyuan.
The climates in different counties are similar. Table 3.4.2-1, Table 3.4.2-2, Table
3.4.2-3, Table 3.4.2-4, and Table 3.4.2-5 show respectively the detailed data on
3 - 4



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project                                Final Repon
precipitation, evaporation, temperature, and maximum frozen earth depth and wind
velocity for each county (city).
3.4.2.3  Severe Storms
Local storms are common in the areas along the WWTP main lines. The storms are
characterized by high strength, short duration, and relatively small area which may
cause severe flooding hazards in the adjacent areas. Two severe cases have been
recorded: One in Yangjiachuan, a Yellow River tributary, in August 1969 which
caused a flood discharge of 11,400 cms in the Wanjiazhai reach of Yellow River, and
another was in Dayin Village in Shuozhou City on 5 July 1962 with a precipitation
record of 250 mm in 24 hours.
3.4.3 Geology
3.4.3.1   General
Section 3.4.3 discusses geology in the overall WWTP project area. However, the
present project is limited to the General Main Line and South Main Line. The WWTP
passes through the Guancen Mountain range (of Luliang mountain ridge) which is
aligned in a northeast to southwest direction with the highest elevations (up to 2,800
m) being over the South Main Line (See Figure 1.1. 1-2). Although most of the area is
covered by a mantle of loess, rock outcrop is extensive. Rocks of many ages are
represented in the project area but the most widespread are the limestones and
dolornites with subsidiary marls and sandstones of Cambrian and Ordovician age,
which are encountered extensively in the tunnels of all two mains. The General Main
Line lies entirely within these rocks. In addition, the northern two-thirds of the South
Main lie within Cambrian and Ordovician limestones. Sedimentary rocks consisting of
sandstones, shales, mudstones, and coals of Carboniferous and Permian age are found
in the central part of the South Main Line. Triassic sandstones and siltstones with
mudstones and shales are encountered along the southern part of the SML.
The cover of loess masks older deposits which infill deep channels which have
developed within the mountain system, particularly the limestone terrain, as the result
of block faulting and associated erosion during and subsequent to the Tertiary period.
These channels are infilled by weak red soils (the N2 red clays) with some gravel
horizons. In addition, residual soils may cap the hills and river alluvium may be found
in the valley bottoms.
The project lies across several major tectonic features which have well defined
characteristics influencing the engineering conditions for construction. The General
Main, and the north part of the South Main all lie within the Pianguan-Shenchi Uplift
Block in which the rocks have a simple structure with flat dips and broad folds, thus
ensuring that the tunnels within this zone will be driven in similar ground conditions
over long distances. The central and south part of the South Main lie in structurally
complex ground on the border of the Upthrown Luliang mass and the Ningwu
Downthrown Block where faulted limestones are brought against younger less
3 - 5



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project                                Final Report
disturbed rocks. Each of these zones is associated with different engineering geological
issues.
Along the GML, the rocks dip gently westwards at angles less than 8 degrees. A
regional flexure causes dips up to 30 degrees along Tunnel #6 but no large faults have
been identified. Along the northern part of the South Main Line the limestones and
dolomites mostly dip gently to the North. To the southeast beyond Wenling at the
intake to Tunnel #7, these rocks are separated by a series of faults in the limestones
from the large synclinal structure in younger Peniian and Triassic rocks whose axis is
parallel to, and just to the southeast of, the South Main.
3.4.3.2   Seismic Zones
The project extends across two seismic zones. The area north of Pianguan County lies
in Intensity Zone 7 and the other areas lies in Intensity Zone 6 as shown in Figure
3.4.3-1 (Ref. 151).
3.4.4 Soils/Erosion
3.4.4.1   Soils
The main soil types in the area along the GML and SML are mountainous brown soil,
drab soil and light meadow soil, etc. The mother material compositions are limestone,
sandshale, loess, pluvial, gully silt, and alluvium.
Mountainous brown earth is distributed in the earth-stone mountain area where the
elevation is above 1800 m, in the boundaries of Shenchi County and Ningwu County.
Its bedrock is gneiss and mingled purple shale, which is a red brown mountainous soil
formed under the bioclimatic conditions of vegetation density, illumination insufficient,
high temperature and rainy in summer, cold and dry in winter. In mature soil area the
vegetation coverage rate is above 90%/0, canopy density is 70.5%, yearly mean air
temperature is about 200C, rainfall 600-780 mm. Soil erosion is light.
Mountainous drab soil belongs zonal soil, distributed along the SMiL extensively,
usually under the brown earth and leaching drab soil at lower mountainous area with
elevation 1400-1800 m. It has been formed under the bioclimate conditions of higher
air temperature (yearly mean 4-50C), sparse rainfall (400 - 600 mm), and a natural
vegetation coverage rate of 50-60%.
Leaching drab soil is distributed at the lower part of middle-high mountains, usually at
the lower limitation of mountainous brown earth, distributed at Haoshuicou reservoir
and Honghe River basin, elevation 1800 - 2000 m.
Vegetation on the soil is mainly bush, with coverage rate of 70 - 90%. The soil has
been formed under the bioclimate conditions of lower temperature and considerable
rainfall. The soil retains the moisture, and has strong leaching properties with obvious
3 - 6



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project                                 Final Report
alluvial horizon. The core soil base is leached and non-lime reaction shows slight
acidity to neutral.
The drab soil is distributed on hill slopes at upper reaches of Fenhe River. Climate
conditions of its formation are high temperature (mean temperature 50C) and moderate
rainfall (500 - 600 mm). This distributes along with mountainous drab soil, with little
natural vegetation less than 40%. The distributed landform is fragmented, full of
gullies, with serious water erosion.
Light meadow soil is distributed in every bioclimatic zone of first -order terrace on the
banks of Fenhe River and Honghe River and flood land and depression land, where the
groundwater level is shallow. Soil is light gray, has strong lime reaction, high organic
matter content. The main vegetation is mainly hygrophilous plants such as Herachloe
odorata, Xanthium sibiricum, Taraxacum mongolium, Echinochloa crusgalli, poplar,
willow.
The soil fertility is shown in Table 3.4.4-1.
3.4.4.2   Soil Erosion
The landform along the GML and SML region varies significantly with varieties crops
and natural vegetation. The landform from Xiatuzhai Division in Pianguan County to
the inlet of Fenhe River includes three zones: Loessal Hill Gully windy and sandy zone,
earth rock mountain zone, and loessal hilly zone. The erosion degree is different in
different zones.
(b. 1) Loessal Hill Gully Zone
This zone includes Xiatuzhai in Pianguan County, Xinhuxingao in Pinglu County,
Wenling in Shenchi County, as well as the area where the Ist and the 2nd pumping
stations and the Wenling buried culvert are located. The land formn in the zone is
fragmented and undulated with high density gullies. The soil in the zone is thick and
the soil structures is loose. The earth surface is covered by loess with little vegetation,
20%-40%. With the extensive cultivation and unlimnited cultivation, soil erosion is
serious in the zone with erosion 'modules of 5,500-20,000 t/km2. The erosion, is mainly
of surface erosion, riverwork erosion or wind erosion.
(b.2) Earth Rock Mountainous Zone
This zone lies in the surrounding areas of the boundaries between Shenchi County and
Ningwu County and between Ningwu County and Jingle County. Although the zone
has high mountains and steep slopes, soil erosion is not serious because the loessal
cover in the zone is thin and base rock is bare in many places and furthermore the
surface is better vegetated with coverage rate over 60%, and there are many large
natural and planted forests. The erosion, mainly surface erosion, is of aged stage with
erosion modulus of 1,000-3,500 t/knM2.
(b.3) Loessal Hilly Terrace Zone
3 - 7



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Projea                               Final Repoq
This zone covers the bank areas of Fenhe River, which is a combination zone of loessal
gully zone with fluvial zone. The zone has the erosion characteristics of the loessal or
gully zone and the characteristics of fluvial erosion, flood scouring, and bank caving.
This zone has good agricultural conditions and is the major grain production area
along the South Main Line. Vegetation, mainly crops, is less than 30%. With wing,
water, gravity erosions act alternately, erosion in this zone is serious, with erosion
modulus of 50008000 tAkn2. The landform of the zone is fractured and full of ridges
and gullies which has caused severe soil erosion.
3.4.5    Surface Water Hydrology
The surface water in the ESA for the GML and SML comes mainly from two rivers,
the Pianguan River and the Fen River of Yellow River system.
(a) Pianguan River
The Pianguan River rises in Limingou, in the west part of Pinglu, enters Pianguan
County at Jiabao Village, Pianguan County and flows into the Yellow River at
Heguankou Village, Pianguan County. The total length of the river is 154 km with a
catchrnent area of 2,040 kin2. Average annual run-off of the river is 59 million m3 as
shown in Table 3.4.5-1.
(b) Fen River
The Fen River originates in Luya Mountain of Guancen Mountains, Ningwu County.
In Ningwu County. The river passes through Dongzhai, Huabeitou, Ninglua and
Shijiazhuang townships with a catchment area of 1,659 km2. Fen River enters Jingle
County after it leaves Shijiazhuang, Nmgwu County. The Fen River has two major
tributaries in its Shenchi-Ningwu Section, Hongie River, and Dongnian River.
Honghe River is a continuous river with an average annual discharge of 0.3m3/s, a total
length of 38 lkn and a catchment area of 561 km2. Dongnian River rises at the
northern part of Yunzhong Mountain, enters Fenhe River at the South of Chengguan.
The Dongnian River rises at the northern part of Yunzghong Mountain enters Fen
River at the South of Chengguan.. The Dongnian River has a total length of 56.2 km
and a catchment area of 506 km2. The discharge is about 0.2-0.8 m3/s when it joins
the Fen River.
Dongnian River rises from Popo Towmship on the north slope of Yuinzhong
Mountain, Jingle County. Passing through Xincun, from northeast to southwest, and
joining the Fen River, it is the largest tributary contributing to the upper reaches of the
Fen River.
Table 3.4.5-1 shows the hydrological parameters of main rivers.

3.4.6.] Types of Groundwater
The underground water along the line is divided into four types, namely pore water of
loose rocks, fissure water of detrital rocks, karst fissure water of carbonate rocks, and
fissure water of magmatic and metamorphic rocks. The grounwater recharge sources
are from precipitation, surface water seepage, and river infiltration.
The first type lies in Tertiary and Quaternary strata, mainly distributed in structural
subsidence basins and river valleys. It is not deeply buried, but dynamic variations are
great, with water-yield property limited by the rock property and depth of acquifers,
and also by the recharging area. In Fenhe and Guanhe River valleys, this part provides
a yield per well of 100 m3/d, but the yield is less than 10 m3/s in most of the project
area-
The second type is generally buried in sand-shale strats of the Carboniferous, Jurassic,
Permian and Triassic systems. The shallow part is mainly weather fissure water, while
the middle-deep parts are mostly structural fissure water. Fissure phreatic water is
above the eroded surface, and interlying fissure pressure water lies beneath. The water
yield property relates to the rock feature and geological structure.
The third type is the predominant type of groundwater along the WWTP. The water-
bearing strata are limestones and dolomite limestones of the middle-older Cambrian
series and the younger-middle Ordovician series. The water-yield property is related to
such elements as rock feature, geological structure, and groundwater runoff. The
maximum potential unit yield per well greatl varies, generally ranging from 100 to
1,000 m3/d. This type is mainly HCO3-Ca, with mineral degree about 0.5 g/l, and the
water quality is execellent. The recharge sources from natural precipitation seepage.
The last type comprises of structural fissure and weather fissure water, mainly
containing HCO3, Ca and Mg.
3.4.6.2   Hvdroizeolonic Area Classification
According to groundwater patterns and conditions of recharge, runoff and discharge,
the project area is divided into four hydrological zones, namely the Pianguan River
upstream zone, Zhujiachuan River upstream zone, Huihe River upstream zone, and
Honghe River basin zone.
The Pianguan River upstream zone lies in the area between Xiatuzhai and Liminbao.
The groundwater in this zone is mainly pore water and Karst water of Carbonate, most
of which is from rainfall and runs from east to west and finally enters the Yellow
River. The groundwater is in the area is deep and limited.
The Zhujiachuan river upstream zone is in the area between Nanbaozi and Shenchi.
The groundwater is mainly pore water in the Wenling Depression and the Zhujiachuan
River Valley and mainly Karst water in the deep limestone of Cambrian and Ordovician
3 - 9



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project                                 Final Report
System with depth of 100 - 300 m. This zone is the Karst water feeder zone to
Shentou Spring area.
The Huihe River upstream zone is part of the hydrological zone of Ningwu-Jingle
water-bearing structure in which sandstone and shale are extensively distributed
forming complex multi-strata water-bearing structures. Usually aquifers in the zone are
not thick with small water quantity. Lower aquifer is artesian and thus forms relatively
independent crevice water systems in detrital rocks. Underlying the stratum of detrital
rock is a large area deeply buried limestone of Ordovician system in which water level
may be 300-500 m below the surface. The Huihe River upstream zone is also a feeder
zone to the Shentou spring water system.
The Honghe River basin zone lies in the hydrogeological zone of Ningwu-Jingle
syncline. The groundwater in the zone is mainly fissured water in detrital rocks which
also has the features of multiple-strata water-bearing structure. The upper stratum
water may discharge along the stratum to valleys while the lower stratum is artesian.
Pore water is mainly retained in unconsolidated debris of Honghe River with rich water
field properties.
3.4.7 Water Quality
3.4.7.1 Surface Water Ouality
The present water quality situation in the upper Fen River and its major tributaries
invoved in the WWTP has beer. monitored and anlyzed on three different occasions.
Details are given in Chapter 5.
3.4.7.2 Groundwater Qualitv
The groundwater in the area along WWTP is mainly comprised of pore o- crevice
water and Karst water, This is all of good quality and suitable for d&iking or
construction usage.
3.4.8 Topography and Geomorphology
The topography and geomorphology in the WWTP area are very complicated. The
land form is generally divided, from north to south, into three zones:
(i)    Loessal hilly andy gully zone with El 1,100-1,300 m
(ii)   Earth, rock mountainous zone with El over 1,500 m
(iii)   Loessal hilly terrace zone with El 900-1,200 m
Table 3.4.8-1 illustrates the topographic constituents of the project-related counties.
As shown in the table, 33% of the total project area is hilly gullies, and 51% is earth
and rock mountainous zone.
3.5    Natural Biological Resources
3 - 10



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project                               Final Repon
3.5.1    Introduction
Natural biological resources are mainly classified.into 3 categories:
(i) Forests and other vegetation
(ii) Terrestrial wildlife
(iii) Aquatic ecology
3.5.2 Forests and Other Vegetation
As stated in Sections 3.4, in the area along the SML, the landform is complex and the
climate varies greatly. This causes clearly different vegetation distributions. The project
area in Pianguan, Pinglu, Shenchi belongs to temperate semi-arid prairie zone, and the
project area in Ningwu belongs to warmn temperate semi-arid prairie zone and the
secondary forest zone dominated by middle, xerophyte coniferous forest. The project
area in Jingle, Loufan belongs to Jingle-Lanxian intermountain basin, which is crop
area with rare natural vegetation. The area around the Fen- I reservoir belongs to grass
moor area:
According to the "Shanxi Forest and Vegetation Resources Investigation Report"
prepared by Shanxi Forest Research Institute in 1990 (Ref. 163), there are four
vegetation types and nine formations. The vegetation types include broad-leaf forest,
brush and prairie. The formations include Populus simonii, pinus tabulaefromris,
Hippophae rhamnoides, Arernisia sp., Thymus mongolicus stipa sp. and Juncellus sp.
Details on these various type/forms are given in Annex G.
Because the WWTP Phase I project will not impact natural flora species only in
already humanized areas, the project will not result in any adverse effects on any rare
plant species, and for the same reason, there will be no adverse impacts on forest
habitat on which rare animal species might be dependent.
3.5.3 Terrestrial Wildlife in Phase I ESA
3.5.3.1  Vertebrate
The WWTP is located in the area of Pianguan, Shenchi, Ningwu, Jingle
and Loufan Counties which belongs to loessial plateau subsection,
North China zone, palaeonorth group. The area has low vegetation
coverage rate (see Section 3.5.2), lacks habitat environment for
animals, and therefore has relative limited animal species and animal
populations.
Details on wildlife species are given in Annex G. In summary the ESA for the project
contains 3 kinds of anphibians, 5 kinds of reptiles, 99 kinds of
birds, and 26 mammal species.
3.5.3.2  Rare Animals
3 - 11



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project                                Final Report
The Chinese system for classification of precious animals inlcudes three grades I, II,
IIl. All are rare, endangered, precious. Grade I is the most important. Grade II is a
lesser level, and Grade III is the lowest preciouslevel.
The project ESA includes 4 kinds of State Protected Grade I animals, and 18 kinds of
Grade n animals.
The Grade I animals are Ciconia nigra, Aquila chrysctos, Crossoptlon mantchuricum,
and Felis pardus. They are very rare. Felis pardus and Aquila chrysctos are in remote
thickly forested mountains, occasionally in low mountain hilly zone. Crossoptilon
mantchuricum is distributed in Ningwu County Luya mountain mainly. Ciconia nigra
breed and build nest in remote mountain steep cliff, and look for food in waters and
swamps. According to perennial surveys in Ningwu County, Ciconia nigra is relatively
more populated and is found to build nests and breed there.
The Grade 11 animals are: Milvus korchumn, Accipiter gentilis, A. nisus, Buteo
hemilascus, B. buteo, A. clanga, Cricus cyancus, Falco cherruq, F. peregninus, F.
columbarius, F. respertinus, F. tinnunculus, Bubo bubo, Athene noctua, Asio otus,
Martes foina, Charronia flavigula, Moschus moschiferus. Among them Milvus
Korschum, Bubo bubo, Martes foina, and Moschus moschiferus stay in mountain area;
the rest have wide activity scope.
All of these animals live outside areas remote from areas where wildlife resources are
expected to be affected by the project.
3.5.3.3 Resource Animals
The ESA for the project inlcudes 31 species of resource animals including Alectoris
graeca, Perdix daurica, Phasianus colcicus, C. rupestris, Vulpes rulpes, Arctonyx
collaris, capreolus capreolus, Lepus capensis etc.. Among them Phasianus colcicus and
Lepus capensis, have large populations, broad distribution, and are most important
resource animals in this area. The animals harmful to humanbeings life and agricultural
production mainly are Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Meriones meridianus,
Cricetulus tritomi Myospalax fontanieri. Cricetulus tritoni, Meriones meridianus, and
Myospalax fontanieri are mainly hanrful for farmland. While Rattus norvegicus and
Mus musculus not only are harmful to agricultural production, but also for
communicate disease transmission.
3.5.4 Aquatic Ecology
3.5.4.1 Introduction
The tunnels and aqueducts involved in GML and SML will be all made in hilly and
mountainous areas, where most of the rivers are seasonal and have little
hydrobiological value.
The Connection Works will utilize the upper reach of the Fen River to deliver the
imported water to Fen-I reservoir, hence it is necessary to evaluate the aquatic
ecology in this river section.

Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project                                 Final Report
3.5.4.2  Plankton in Upper Reach of Fen River
The plankton in this river section comprise mainly the following species:
(a)   Pyrrophyta: Peridinium  bipes Stein, P. volzii Lemm., Ceratium
hirundinella Schr.
(b)   Cyanophyta: Oscillatorin agardhii Gom., Micricytis Pseudofilamentosa
Crow.
(c)   Bacillariophyta: Cyclotella comta (Ehr.) Kutz., C. meneghiniana Kutz.,
Nitzschia palea (Kutz.) W. Smith.
(d)   Euglenophyta: Englena viridis Ehr.
(e)   Chlorophyta: Chiamydomonas reinhardi Dang., Chlorella vulgaris Beij.,
Scnedesmus quadricauda (Turp.) Breb., S. obliguus (Turp.) Kutz.
These are all comrnon species and are important only for supporting fish and other
aquatic animals.
3.5.4.3 Aguatic Animal in URper Reaches of Fen River
The aquatic animals here are predominantly fish, without any significant shellfish
species.
There are some 17 species of fish includign Mylopharyngodon piceus,
Ctenopharyngodon idellus, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, Aristichthys nobilis,
Cyprinus carpio, Carassius auratus, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, and Fluta alba,
Ctenopharyngodon idellus, Cyprinus carpio, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and
Carassius auratus. These are all common species, are few in numbers, are found only in
the rainy season, and have no commercial value and not even subsistence value.
3.6    Development
3.6.1 Urbanization
Because the WWTP lines passes mainly through mountain areas, no significant urban
development is seen along the main lines of the Project of Phase I.
The project will cause certain local people (mostly farmers) to be resettled.
3.6.2    Industry
Due to the reasons mentioned in Section 3.6. 1, no important industry is expected to be
developed in the area along the project.
3.6.3    Infrastructure
Due to the reason mentioned in Section 3.6.1, no important infrastructure has been
developed in the area along the Main Lines.
3 - 13



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project                              Final Report
3.6.4    Agriculture
Because of the reason of poor landformn and unfavorable climate, agricultural
production level in the South Main area is very low. Agriculture with some stock
raising is the main income source for local people. The major crops are naked oats,
flax, soybean, Chinese yam, pea, broom corn millet, spring wheat, corn, sorghum and
other coarse cereals. The yearly farmland output .is generally 50-100 kg/mu for hilly
land and 250-400 kg/mu for fluvial land.
Table 3.6.4-1 shows the agricultural prodection indices (1994) of counties along the
WWTP.
3.7    QUALITY OF LIFE
3.7.1 General Description
The impact of quality of life in Shanxi Province by WWTTP will be primarily on (a)
economy and people's livelihood in the areas to be covered by the project, and (b)
economy and people's livelihood in Taiyuan Service Area. To some extent the socio-
economics throughout the province will be somewhat affected. Section 3.7 focuses
only on the impacts on the present quality of life in the affected areas.
For GML construction, some 54 villagers from 16 houses distributed in 6 villages will
be moved. No houses will be disturbed for construction of SML, Connection Works,
and Huyan Treatment Plant, but some production arrangemnents will be required for
affected people. Table 3.7.1 -1 includes the distribution of populations to be affected by
land acquisition and to be provided with production arrangements.
3.7.2 Income in Project Affected Areas
The socio-economic background data (1994) for the affected communities along the
GML and SUL are shown in Table 3.7.2-1. This tabulation shows:
(i)  All the townships along the WWTP have similar socio-economic
background.
(ii) The economics in most townships is dependent upon agriculture, mainly
cropping activities, with some forestry and animal husbandry. Industry and
transport play the leading role in the economics of some townships in
Ningwu County.
(iii) The annual per capita net income of rural people ranges from 650 to 1,000
yuan. Out of the total number of 14 townships covered in this study, only 3
have per capita net income levels higher than the provincial average.
Table 3.7.2-2 illustrates the socio-economic background data of the villages along the
Connection Works. This shows that the villagers in Dujiaoqu Township of Loufan
County are very poor, with an annual per capita net income of 355-409 yuan, mainly
3 - 14



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project                                 Final Report
from cropping activity. Those living in Gujiao City and in the north outskirts of
Taiyuan are comparatively well off, enjoying an annual per capita net income level of
1,400-2,300 yuan, also mainly from cropping activity.
As stated above, it is obvious that the economic levels along the WWTP are generally
on the lower side, with little industry and poor agricultural facilities. Although the per
capita farmland area is not small, the local people are generally impoverished. A
primary reason for this is shortage of water.
3.7.3 Other Quality of Life Indices
(a)    Transportation
Highways play the leading role in the local communications along the GML and SML.
There is truck road from Yuanping to Inner Mongolia, passing through Ningwu,
Shenchi, and Pianguan Counties. The road from Pinglu to Wanjiazhai dam was
recently opened to traffic.
The communication facilities along the area of transmission lines of WWTP were
relatively poor and were not at all adequate fpr meeting the requirements of project
construction. Since the start of the WWTP in 1993, a main access road from Pinglu to
Wanjiazhai has been constructed along the GML, with a total length of 114 km. Also,
19 km regional roads have been completed. A highway network, with the main access
road playing the leading part, is formed, which practically relieves the transportation
difficulty along the GML.
Ningwu-Kelan railway passes across the north part of Ningwu from southeast to
northwest, and also the south part of Shenchi County from east to west. The northern
Tong-Pu railway, after leaving the plain area, trends northward to pass through the
north part of Ningwu.
Along the SML, 15 km construction roads have been completed to serve construction
of SMl.
Figure 3.7.3-1 illustrates the transportation network, including highways and railways,
in the WW\'TP area.
Figure 3.7.3-1 shows the communication facilities available to the 16 affected villages
affected by GML. These include Tai-Nin road and Tai-Jing road passing Dujiaoqu
Township, plus roads with gravel pavement connecting villages. Tai-Gu-Lan road and
Tai-Nin road connect Gujiao City with the outside. Tai-Nin road connects all other
roads outside Gujiao City, but with heavy traffic due to the narrow road. A new Tai-
Jing road is proposed, which would greatly relieve the traffic of Gujiao to the outside.
There is a road from Chaicun Township to Taiyuan, which connects Huyan to the
capital of the province.
(b)   Domestic Water Supply
3- 15



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project                                Final Report
The per capita water consumption in Taiyuan is only 100 L/d, only 41% of the average
in China. The volume for rural communities in the ESA is much less.
In all cases drinking water supplies are inadequate for the local communities along the
GML. Most of the local people rely on groundwater from wells. Since the
commencement of the GML, the project proponent have drilled a total of 12 wells for
drinking and construction water supply, providing adequate drinking water and some
irrigation water for 10 villages in 5 townships along the alignment.
For the construction of the SML, 4 wells have been drilled and 2 are being drilled by
the project proponent. As the SML proceeds, the drinking water supply for the local
residents will be better.
In the ESA for the Connection Works, water shortage is an extremely serious problem
for all villages. In Dujiaoqu Township, 4 villages must rely, without guarantee for both
quality and quantity, on the water supply from Fen-I reservoir. This is delivered
through a pipeline to Gujiao Township, except Dujiaoqu Village which uses
groundwater from wells. The drinking water for 10 villages of Gujiao Township and
Huyan Village comes mainly from groundwater sources. Of these a few villages enjoy
tap water.
(c)    Power Supply, Public Address Facilities, Television, and Telecommunications
Most of the villages along the WWTP have power supply, public address facilities, and
TV reception facilities, Telephone lines are available for some of them. All townships
are provided with post and telecommunications.
WWTP includes the provision of 80 km optical cables and audio cables. A total
number of 2,000 program-controlled telephone channels have been put into service,
greatly improving the telecommunications in Pianguan. Also, power supply for light
purposes is accessible to 3 remote villages, these ending the use of oil lamps. Along
with the WWTP construction, the public address, TV, and other cultural and
recreational facilities will be accordingly bettered.
(d)   Culture and Education
Most of the WWTP passing areas are remote rural areas. The cultural and educational
conditions in the areas are much less developed.
In the Connection Works passing area, Dujiaoqu Township is located in a poverty
mountain region. There is only a junior high school and one opera stage. All the
villages have their own primary schools, but without enough teachers and education
facilities. Better facilities are available in the Fen Reservoir Management Bureau,
which serves to improves the life and education conditions of the people living in this
vicinity.
All villages in Gujiao have their own primary schools, and all townships have middle
schools and opera stages, but cultural and education facilities are still rather poor.
3 - 16



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project                                 Final Repon
However, the situation is much better in Gujiao City. Because of its better level of
economic development, cultural and educational services are flourishing, which
considerably improves the cultural quality and educational circumstances of the local
people.
Table 3.7.3-1 describes the background of education in the WWTP passing counties.
The ratio of full-time teachers to pupils at primary school is about 7.3 (Pinglu) to 27
(Jingle), and about 10 (Loufan) to 16 for middle school. This means shortage of
teachers.
(e)    Health and Medical Care
As shown in Table 3.73.2, which includes the background information on health and
medical care services, such facilities are relatively poor except for Gujiao City. To take
an example, the medical engineering staff per 1,000 people in Pinglu is only 2.13,
compared to the provincial average of 4.64. There are 2.02 sick beds available per
1,000 people, as compared to the provincial average of 3.42.
3.7.4 Taiyuan Service Area (TSA)
3.7.4.1 Low Per Capita Income
The shortage of water  forces many industries to limit their production. The
development of new industries is strictly constrained. According to the 1993 statistical
data provided by Taiyuan, the gross output value of industry and agriculture was
18.716 billion yuan, less than 8,500 yuan per capita. The per capita income level is the
lowest among the large and medium-sized cities in China.
3.7.4.2  Less Per Capita Water Use
The per capita water use immediately relates to the quality of life. In 1993, the volume
in Taiyuan was only 90 I/d, which was further reduced to 85 l/d in 1995. In the
peripheral areas, the volume was only.30-50 i/d. The desperate shortage of water
significantly affected the life of quality. For example, some miners do not have water to
take bath when come out of shafts. About 420,000 residents in 42 kM2 have been
suffering from interrupted and low-pressure water supply. Water supply is not
accessible to most multi-stored buildings until. midnight, representing great
inconvenience to people's livelihood.
In addition, the inadequate water supply provides high morbidities of enteric and other
communicable diseases in the urban areas, directly affecting the local economic
development and public health.
3.7.4.3   Poor Gardening and Afforestation
As a famous city with a history of 2,500 years, Taiyuan enjoys a rich cultural heritage.
There are 52 cultural sites at national, provincial and municipal levels. These are,
however, very adversely affected by the unavailability of water. For instance, Lanlao
3 - 17



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project                                Final Report
spring at Jingci has dried up as a result of groundwater over-exploitation. The Tong-
dynasty locust tree at Dicun is also approaching to death as a consequence of water
shortage. There are 5 parks and 11 small gardens, all of which have lost their planned
functions.
This situation of water supply also affects afforestation in Taiyuan. There are
altogether 12 million trees, 180.93 ha lawns, and 1,500 green pockets. The per capita
green land area is still lower than national average. The inadequate afforestation in
Dongshan and Xishan mountains is believed to contribute significantly to increase in
Total Suspended Particules in TSA air quality.
3.7.5 Summary
The available information on socio-econonic conditions in the areas affected by the
Phase I project indicates the following:
(a)    Shanxi Province, including the WWTPIESA, represents one of the
poorest regions in China, despite the presence of considerable rnineral
resources, especially the developed coal mining and power industries.
(b)    The people in the ESA, in their reliance on economic income sources,
are in roughly two categories, (i) those in urban centers who are
working mainly industry, and (ii) rural villagers who depend mainil on
agriculture. The latter are much poorer than the former.
(c)    By far the most important parameter, which is crippling the continuing
development of the province, is lackl of water supply for all sectors of
development, and especially in the urban/industrial sector which
represents the backbone of the overall economic/social-economic
resources of the province.
3.8 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
3.8.1 Purpose of Chapter 3
This chapter (i) delineates the Environmental Study Area (ESA) for the Phase I
project, comprising the areas that are most likely to be affected by the project, and (ii)
describes the existing environmental resources in this area.
3.8.2 Environmental Study Area Maps
Figure 3.2.1-1 shows the Overall WWTP/Phase I/ESA. Figures 3.2.2-1,2,3,4,5 show
the EIAs for the Phase I components, namly Wanjiazhai Reservoir, GML, SML, Fen-l
Reservoir, Connection Wroks, and the Taiyuan service area, respectively.

Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project                                  Final Report
The overall WWTP project area is primarily hilly and mountainous and the landuse in
the area can be broadly categorized into farmland, gardenplot, forest, grassland,
residential and industrial area, infrastructure, water area and wasteland area (Table
3.3.1-1). Land use has long been impacted by human activities, primarily agriculture,
and the impact has been particularly severe on the area's forest and wildlife resources.
Land use impact will be felt strongly in the buffer zones along the transmission lines,
the Taiyuan service areas, and the reservoir areas.
3.8.3.2 Natural Physical Resources
WWTP is located in the northwest part of the Shanxi province. The project traverses
the Luliang mountain, to west of which is the main Yellow River Basin. The project
region enjoys temperate/seasonalUcontinental zone type of climate with the average
annual temperature between 4.6°C and 7c. The area is drought prone and the annual
precipitation ranges between 430-480 mm.
The WWTP area passes through the Guancen Mountain range, several other major
tectonic features, and traverses two seismic zones. The soil in the GML is loose and
prone to erosion. Excessive erosion has disturbed the ecological balance and affected
the land utility of the area. Soil in SML also is subjected to serious surface erosion.
Pianguan river, tributarie of Yellow River, constitutes the major surface hydrology for
the GML, and the Pianguan, Jian-er, and Fen rivers for the SML.
The hydrological indices for the main rivers in the region are given in Table 3.4.5-1.
The underground hydrological conditions are governed by the regional geological
structure units. The groundwater along the WWTP is of good quality and suitable for
drinking and construction purposes.
3.8.3.3   Natural Biological Resources
The natural biological resources have been categorized into, (i) forests and other
vegetation, (ii) terrestrial wildlife and (iii) aquatic ecology. The area along the GMNL
can be classified into the following flora zone categories, Pan-North Pole flora zone,
Eurasian steppe subflora zone, Mongolian steppe zone and Eastem Mongolia zone.
Vegetation exhibits prairie and transitional characteristics, with a wide variety of
seeded plant species. Landform in the SML area is complex and the climate varying
hence different vegetation distributions are found, ranging from temperate semi-arid
prairie zone in Pianguan, Pinglu, and Shenchi to warm temperate semi-arid prairie zone
in Ningwu.
A total of 150 animal species are found including 22 state protected species and 31
resource animal species. The ESA for the project has low vegetation coverage and
lacks suitable environment for animal habitat.
Few aquatic plants are found in the ESA for the project area, and none of these are in
the rare or endangered categories. Some 17 different kinds of fish are found in the

GML area, but these have no commercial value and are hardly valuable even for
subsistence.
3.8.3.4  Development Resources
(a)   Agriculture
Area along the GML lines is primarily an agricultural region. Chief source of income
for the local population is farming and livestock development. Crops like millet, beans,
corn, naked oats, potato, sesame, broomcorn millet and fruits like apple, pears and
grapes are grown. The output is low though, because of the hilly and mountanious
terrain. Inadequate water supply in the plains accounts for low agricultural output.
Livestock development is manily in the form of sheep raising.
Agricultural production is low in the SML area because of poor landformn and
unfavorable climatic conditions, although it still is the main source of income for the
local people. The major crops are naked oats, flax, soybean, Chinese yam, pea, broom
corn millet, spring wheat, cor, sorghum and other coarse cereals.
(b)   Urbanization
Most of the project area is hilly and mountanious and there is no signficant urban
development in the region. Construction of reservoirs in the future project phase will
cause some resettlement of the local populace, especially the farming community.
(c)   Indusrialization
Difficult terrain has prevented any significant industrial development from taking place
in the region.
(d)   Regional Infrastructure
The development of any significant regional infrastructure has been limited by the
inhospitable terrain.
3.8.3.5  Quality of Life Resources
The available information on socio-economic conditions in the areas affected by the
Phase I project indicate the following:
(a) Shamci Province, including the WWTP/ESA, represents one of the poorest
regions in China, despite the presedce of considerable mineral resources,
especially the coal mining and power industries.
(b) The people in the ESA, in their reliance on economic income sources, are in
roughly two categories, (I) those in urban certers who are working mainly in
industry, and (ii) rural villagers who depend mainly on agriculture. The latter
are much poorer than the former.

(c) By far the most important paramenter, which is crippling the continuing
development of the province, is lack of water supply for all sectors of
development. This includes both the urban/industrial sector which represents
the backbone of the overall economic/social-economic resources of the
province, and the rural farning sector where the people are very poor despite
availability of adequate farm land areas.

A summary of environmental resources in Shanxi Province, as- related to WWTP/Phase
I, is given in Figure 3.8.3-1.

ENVIRONIMENTAL ASSESSMENT
AND RECOMMENDED EPMs
4.1  IETRODUCTION
4.1.1 Delineation of SEIs
Chapter 4 presents the essential findings of the EIA process, namely (i) delineation of
the SEIs (Significant Environmental Issues), (ii) evaluation of each of these to mak-e a
quantified assessment of the potentials for adverse environmental effects if no
correction measures, i.e., EPMs (Environmental Protection Measures) are utilized, (iii)
and delineation and quantification of the needed EPMs so that the project will be
economically sound. In addition, there is the need for environment monitoring
programs during the construction and operation stages, which are given in Chapter 7.
Figure 4.1.1-1 shows the various EIA tasks, which are named and numbered to match
the headings/numbers of the EIA Table of Contents. As shown in the figure, some of
the tasks cover the entire project ( for example, resettlement and public health) xvhile
other relate to specific project components (such as the reservoir EIAs and the Taiyuan
service area water use evaluations).
4.1.2  EIA Strategy
(a) In 1993-94, at the request of YRDP, CIRP completed the reports "EIA for
WWTP (GMfL, NML)" (Reference 101) and "EIA for the WWTP (SML)"
(Reference 102), which were subsequently approved by NEPA. In addition, a
number of other WWTP related studies, including some EIA components, were
carried out for YRDP by TIDI, SIDI, and other agencies. At this time the
WWTP was intended to be locally financed.
(b) Subsquent to (a), the Chinese Government and World Bank agreed that the
World Bank should participate in the financing. Accordingly ELC prepared
an initial English version EIA report, following World Bank  guidelines,
over the period July 1995 to Appril 1996 (the ELC/EIA repor i;
(c) The World Bank Mission which visited Taiyuan in April 1996 reviewed and
prepared corrments on the ELC/EIA report. In addition, the Mission and
WWTP agreed on some changes in the WWTP Plan. As a result, it was agreed
that the ELC/EIA report would need to be revised and upgraded.
(d) In April 1996 YRDP contracted with CIRP/SU to prepare a Chinese version
EIA report  for WWTP in accordunce with NEPA requirements. Also the
YRDP and the Mission agreed that both the Chinese EIA report to be prepared
by CIRP/SU and the upgraded English version EIA should utilize the same
Table of Contents and that the contents of both reports should be essentially
the same.

Waniiazhai Water Transfcr Project                                  Final Report
(e) To meet the agreements and decisions noted above, the project final EIA
reports, dated JuIY 1996, in both Chinese and Engligh versions, have been
prepared to be essentially the same, in order to meet both Chinese Government
and World Bank requirements, with the WB EIA team serving together with
and in assistance to CIRP/SU.
4.1.3 Initial Environmental Examination
An initial Environmental Examination, based on the information available from the
earlier studies and other sources, was made in July 1995 to identify the SEIs and to
rate their relative importance, so that the subsequent EIA work effort would give
primary attention to the critical environmental issues. This evaluation, which is
included in Figure 4.1.1-1, shows that the critical SEls are the following:
* Availability of water for export to Shanxi.
* Critical need for additional water in project senrice area and optimal use of
both the imported and local water resources.
* Maintenance of imported water quality along the water transfer system.
D Treatment of wastes in Taiyuan City to promote water reuse and to
maintain acceptable water quality in the downstream Fen river.
3 Construction constraints on environmental protection
D Adequate provisions for resettlement for families to be moved because of
WWTP components (including Wanjiazhai reservoir).
* Assurance of continuing delivery of imported water.
* Provisions for adequate environenntal monitoring during both construction
and operations stages, and for needed environmental training.
* Establishment of an Enviroranental Management Office within YRDP for
ensuring that needed EPMs, including environmental monitoring and
environmental training, will be adequately performed.
4.1.4 EIA Task Procedure
The various SEIs are reviewed in Chapter 4 and S. Each of the SEIs included in
Chapter 4 is evaluated as a subsection of Chapter 4 as presented below. Each task
evaluation includes: (i) reference as needed to the related subsections of Chapter 2 and
3, (ii) reference to information available from earlier (or ongoing) studies (Fig. 1.5-2),
(iii) description of the approach used by the EIA team for making the assessment for
the particular SEI, and (iv) presentation of taskl results including recommendations for
continuing environmental protection action and including a final section on "Summary
and Conclusions" which can be utilized as to be part of the EIA Executive Summary.
In addition, each task includes information on the monitoring program for the task, to
be included in Chapter 7.

SECTION 4.2
LAND USE
4.2.1 Basic Information on Land Use in ESA
As noted in Section 3.3 of Chapter 3, the land use in the ESA can be classified into
plain irrigated land, rain-fed land, dry steppe, slope grassland, woodland, and exposed
rocky land. Most of the land is covered with bushes and/or thick-grown bush grass. In
the reservoir and residential areas the cultivated crops become dominant. It can be
concluded that the pattern of the land use in the ESA has been deeply effected by the
natural environment with temperate monsoon continental dry climate, long-term
human activities of more than 3,000 years, and current limited agricultural
productivity.
4.2.2 Current Situation
4.2.2.1 Direct Changes in Land Use
The direct change in the land use results from the land acquisition by the construction
of WWTP. In the areas surrounding the inlets and outlets of the tunnels or along the
tunnels, the land is required to heap the waste soils and rocks and construct the worker
camps, which will essentially destroy the land vegetation coverage and temporarily
change the cultivated land into waste land. On the basis of the project design 747.7 ha
of land is required for project construction. About 476.1 ha of this is cultivated land
along the GML, SML, and Connection Works, which is heaped with waste rocks and
looses its availability for agricultural use. Table 4.2-1 shows the land to be used for
AWVTP construction.
4.2.2.2 Problems from Changes
The significant problem will be permanent or temporal loss of land availability for
agriculture. The inundation of rural farming land needs economical compensation as
part of the resettlement plan. And new areas needs to be developed for the Wanjiazhai
reservoir affected villagers, which will change the current land use of the host areas
e.g., more irrigated land will be developed.
The lands occupied by waste rocks from the tunnel construction looses its fertility and
is vulnerable to soil erosion. In order to minimize adverse effects, the places for
disposal of tunnel excavation materials should be carefully managed as described in
Section 4.11.4. The impacts of Connection Works on land use is described in Section
4.13.
4.2.3 Summary and Condusions
The significant impacts of WWTP on land use for Phase I will be in (a) acquisition of
land for the transmission line facilities which are above ground, including construction
camps, and (b) land needed for disposal of tunnel excavation materials, which totally
amounts to some 747.7 ha of which 301.7 ha will be used only temporarily. About
476.1 ha of the required land is farmland. However, the reduction of farmland, both

permanent and temporary, should not have any significant impacts on farming in the
region traversed by the Phase I project because this only represents less than 0.1 of I
percent of the farmland in the region (492,200 ha) (Table 3.3.1-1).

SECTION 4.3
HfYDROLOGY
4.3.1 General
Section 4.3 discusses the environmentai aspects of changes in hydrology in ESA due to
WWTP. Sections 3.4.5 and 3.4.7 review the existing hydrology in the ESA. The
following considerations are based on the available information provided in Ref. 101,
102, 106, 111, 113, 134, 137, 148, 149, 150, and 151.
The environmental concerns on project hydrology related to the effects caused by the
water transmission system along its route, on beneficial uses of both surface water and
groundwater resources, both during the construction and operation stages. The effects
due to the construction stage are temporary, whereas those during the operation stage
are continuing.
The main concerns here are given to the areas along the main transmission lines (GIV,
SME). The impacts of the WWTP project on hydrology for WWTP reservoirs are
discussed in Section 4.8, for the Connection Works area are discussed in Section 4.13.
4.3.2 Surface Water
The planned WWTP Project, when completed, will divert annually from Wanjiazhai
Reservoir 640 million m3 water to Taiyuan Service Area and 560 million m3 to the
Pingshuo and Datong Service Areas when these are connected. However for Phase I,
limited to SML, only 350 million m3 will be diverted in 2001 and other 290 million m3
in 2004.
By improving the surface. water resources conditions, the diverted water will have
significant positive impacts on the surface water hydrology (a) in the service area and
(b) in the Fen River reach from the SML outlet to Fen-I Reservoir (the average annual
runoff of Fen River upstream the Fen-l Reservoir is 368 nillion m3). Assuming the
recommended EPMs are properly followed and implemented during both construction
and operation stages, the project is expected to have no significant negative impacts on
hydrology in the Project ESA.
4.3.3 Flooding Hazards
4.3.3.1 Flooding Hazards Caused by Proiect Component Faliures
The WWTP mainly comprises tunnels, aqueducts, pipes or culverts with tunnels and
culverts comprising most of the project.
Flooding hazards are very unlikely to be caused by tunnel failures because the tunnels
are deeply in the ground. But some limited flood hazards may be caused by pipe,
aqueduct, or culvert failures due to earthquakes, poor operations, and poor
construction quality.
4.3-1



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiea                               Final ReL
When such failure occurs, the monitoring and control system to be established along
the project will function to stop the diversion inmmediately, so the water released out
the pipe or aqueducts is limited to only the water volume in the transmission line
between two nearest valves-(gates) which are designed to be promptly closed. The
volume of any such release would be less than 1.0 million m3 with discharge rate less
than 30 m3/s. This should cause no serious damage to the area except inundating some
surrounding farmlands.
An adequate monitoring and control system will be established along the main lines
which will ensure the flow of diverted water is stopped timely in case of pipe or
aqueduct failures. The EMO (Chapter 9) will implement whis monitoring.
4.3.3.2. F1oodin Hazards Caused bv Dam Failures
Section 4.8 discusses management of flood hazard potentials which could be caused by
dam failures in Wanjiazhai and Fen-1 reservoirs.
4.3.3.3 Discharge to Fen River
The only existing stream to which the diverted water will be discharged is the Fen
River reach from the outlet of SML to Fen-l reservoir (see Figure 1.1.1-1). The water
conveyed to the Taiyuan Service Area is discharged from the SML outlet into the Fen
River and then flows, along natural river course, to Fen-l reservoir.
In Phase I, a flow of 14.1 m3/s in year 2001 and 25.8 m3/s in year 2004 will be
discharged continuously during the 10 month diverting period, from October to July of
next year.
The Fen river has a large drainage basin of 5,268 kcm2 at Fen-1 Reservoir and a greater
natural flow, about 60.7i3/s for maximum monthly average. The peak flood discharge
for once in 100 years and once in 2000 years are estimated at 3,600 m3/s and 6,140
m%/s. The impact of the diverte4 water on river flooding hazards should be of minor
importance.
4.3.3.4 Flooding Caused by Sedimentation
As discussed in Section 4.9, no significant flooding hazard is sexpected from
sedimentation of the imported silt.
4.3.4 Groundwater
4.3.4.1 Impacts of Tunnel Construction
(a)   South Main Line
As shown in Figure 4.3.4-1, almost all the elevations of the main line are 50-250 m
higher that groundwater level. The construction of tunnels will have no significant
impacts on groundwater in the project area.
(b)   General Main Lines
4.3-2



Waniiazhai Water Trnsfer Proiect                                Final Rport
The G/N Main Lines may be divided into 4 sections namely: Wanjazhai dam to No. 2
Pumping Station, No. 4 Tunnel to No. 3 Aqueduct, No. 10 Tunnel to No. 3 Pumping
Station, No.3 Pumping Station to Xiatuzhai.
(b.1) Waniiazhai Dam to No. 2 Pumpinn Station
The elevation of the tunnel in this section in 56-329 m higher than the groundwater
level. Therefore, the tunnel construction in this section will have no impacts on
groundwater in the area around the section.
(b.2) No. 4 Tunnel to No. 3 Aqueduct
The elevation of tunnel in this section is 73-326 m higher than groundwater level.
Therefore, the tunnel construction will have no impact on groundwater in the area
around the section.
(b.3) No. 10 Tunnel to No. 3 Pumpine Station
The elevation of tunnel in this section is 2-59 m higher than the groundwater level.
The impacts of the tunnel construction on groundwater should be negligible.
(b.4) No. 3 Pumping Station to Xiatuzhai
The elevation of tunnel in this section is EL 1288 m and the groundwater level has an
elevation of 1214 m. The construction of the tunnel here should have no significant
impacts on groundwater.
4.3.4.2 Inmacts of Construction Water Usage
The surface water source available in the construction sites along WWTP main lines is
very limited for construction water usage. Groundwater has to be used during the
construction stage.
A total of 16 wells with a total capacity of 14,280 m'/d (day) have been planned for
12 construction sites for water supply for construction of the General Main Line as
shown in Table 4.3.4-1.
A total of 25 wells with a total capacity of 6,550 m3/d have been planned for 24
construction sites for water supply for construction of the South Main Line as shown
in Table 4.3.4-2.
A total of 10 wells with a total capacity of roughly 12,000 m3/day have been planned
for the construction of the Connection Works. Most of the wells are to be distributed
along the banks of the Fen River (the 40.2 km pipelines are to be built along the Fen
River Banks).
The construction usage of groundwater will lower the groundwater table to some
extent during the construction period. However, the impacts will not be significant
because the wells are distributed along the main lines over a total length of 194 km
(GML, 44 kmn, SML, 103 kmn, Connection Works, 47 kmn).
4.3-3



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiewt                                Final Report
The construction usage of groundwater will have negeligible impacts on existing users
because of the following four reasons:
(a) Most of the construction sites are in remote mountainous areas with rare or
without existing users.
(b) The selected wells are located far from existing wells.
(c) The affective radium of each construction well has been considered in the
selection of the well location, to avoid conflicts with existing users.
(d) Daily water volume for each well is limited to level below 1,000 m3/day which
are small.
4.3.4.3 Effects of Groundwater on Tunnel Construction
As discussed in Section 4.3.4.1, the groundwater level in most areas along the main
lines is much lower than the tunnel elevation. Therefore, the groundwater would have
no significant impacts on tunnel construction. However, necessary protection measures
have been required by design engineer (Ref. 148, 149, 150) to be taken during tunnel
construction.
4.3.5 Monitoring Program
4.3.5.1 Construction Stace
The needs of water and the sources to be utilized must be stated and identified by the
Construction Contractors (CC) at the time of his proposal.
The Project's Environmental Management Office (See Chapter 9) will routinely check
the CC's operations as related to effects on hydrology so that all potentials for adverse
effects will be suitably controlled for the purposes of expediting construction and for
avoiding and/or offsetting any conflicts with existing beneficial water uses.
The following monitoring systems should be established or improved in the areas along
the WWTP Project:
(a) A hydrological monitoring system to monitor surface water hydrology
along WWTP and to predict potential floods in the area.
(b) A groundwater monitoring system to monitor both quantity and quality of
groundwater in the construction areas to ensure they are not significantly
affected by project construction activities.
(c) A report and check system, by the ECIs, to see that all hydrological
protection measures are followed by construction contractors.

Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                 Final ReDort
A comprehensive hydrological monitoring system will be established by YRDP
covering the entire WWTP. The system includes the following:
(a)    A monitoring and control center.
(b)   A number of monitoring and control stations with adequate and skilled
staff and adequate instrumentation.
(c)    A complete monitoring network which should be able to:
(i)    Promptly detect any potential of dam, tunnel, pipe, aqueduct
and other project component failures.
(ii)   Predict potential floods.
(iii)   Act rapidly to prevent failures or to minimize the impacts of
failures or floods.
4.3.5.2.2    Role of EMO
.The EMO's overall monitoring program (Chapter 7) is to include periodic monitoring
of water quality along SMLConnection Works, and periodic checking on perfornance
of YRDP's comprehensive hydrology monitoring program.
4.3.6 Summary and Conclusions
The WWTP will divert water from Wanjiazhai Reservoir to the Taiyuan service area,
and this is not expected to significantly affect surface water and groundwater
hydrology in the affected areas from Wanjiazhai Reservoir to Taiyaun.
The potential environmental haards due to changes in hydrology include (i)
flooding hazard due to failure of tunnels or other transmission facilities, (ii) discharge
of diverted flow to the Fen river above Fen-l reservoir (iii) flooding caused by
sedimentation, (iv) flooding of Fen-I reservoir (discussed in Section 4.8.4), and (v)
impacts of tunnel construction on groundwater resources and impact of groundwater
on tunnel construction. All of these are manageable by use of protection measures
which are included in the project planning for both construction and operation stages
including continuing monitoring. Hence, it is expected that WWTP's effects on
hydrology will not result in any significant adverse effects. Infiltration from reservoirs
should have a positive effect in alleviating overdrafing of groundwater in ESA.
Tunneling, as proposed for WWTP, is a high specialized business. It is essential that
this construction be undertaken by contractors with expertise in this type of work in
order to minimize the problems which can be caused by groundwater and thus avoid
excessive extra costs.
During the construction period the ECIs  (who are to be furnished by the
Environmental Management Office-discussed in Chapter 9) should monitor the CC's
work to ensure his use of water does not conflict with existing beneficial water uses,
especially of groundwater.

SECTION 4.4
SPECIAL DESIGN ISSUES
4.4.1    Introduction
The purpose of Section 4.4. is to check on aspects of design of WWTP facilities to
ensure that adequate attention has been given in the design of the facilities to guard
against any possible failure of the facilities in event of earthquakes or any unusual
hazards which may be encountered affecting stability and functioning of structures and
affecting workers health and safety. Project hazards relating to the project
dams/reservoirs are discussed in Section 4.8.
4.4.2    Tunnel Hazards
The concerns here are that (a) the tunnel design take into account the earthquake
hazard in the region, (b) provision be made in the tunnel design to enable prompt repair
of tunnel failures, (c) the overall project plan will include sufficient storage in the
system's reservoirs to that the system can continue to function in the event of failure of
delivery of water because of tunnel collapse or any other reason, and (d) the tunnel
construction methods will include adequate attention to worker health and safety.
4.4.2.1    Assurance of Continuing Delivery of Water
In general the overall plan for WWTP will furnish two months storage for each of
the three target service areas in order to (i) enable shutdown of delivery from
Wanjiazhai for two months, and (ii) furnish enough storage to overcome the hazard
of tunnel collapse. However, this assumes, for delivery of the full 640 million m3
per year to Taiyuan Service Area will not take place until Haoshuigou reservoir id
built and is operative (Year 2006). Meanwhile only 350 million m3 per year will be
diverted to the SML, and for this volume the existing Fen 1 reservoir can furnish
the needed two months of storage.
For the purpose noted above a new intake tower will be built on the right bank of
Fen I reservoir with a stop log gate at the intake which is higher than the elevation
of the sediment just behind the dam. The lowest operational level of the gate is EL
1114 m.
4.4.2.2   Other Issues
Based on the site visits, the following comments can be made:
(a) The limestone rock mass being excavated along the access adits to GML Pump
Stations numbers I and 2 is of good and excellent quality and as predicted according
to preliminary design documents. It appears that excavation proceeds in a reasonable
manner and that the execution of blast is good, as the half barrels of perimeter holes
show. The amount of overbreak and , hence, the rock quantities to be removed are
reduced to a minimum, at least along the tunnel length, away from the portal area.
(b) The reinforcement measures (rock bolting with wire mesh and shotcreting, where
appropriate) are being delayed as no rock bolts appear to be installed in the access
adits to both Pump Stations I and 2 beyond the portal. Where bolts are in place (this is
4.4 - I



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                               Final Rswrt
the case of the left adit to the GML Pump Station n. 2), they appear to be of no help as
they are not integrated with the wire mesh and are not provided with end plate or nut.
It is therefore obvious that if reinforcement is needed, the delay in the time of
installation and the type of bolts used will not prevent the rock mass from loosening
and deteriorating.
(c) The TBM (tumel boring machine) performance in the GML tunnel n. 8 is excellent,
given the monthly advance rate average approximately equal 1000 m, which is wel on
the upper limit of performance in Europe. Based on careful examination along the most
recently completed tunnel length, it appears that the microfissure in the concrete
segments which were of great concen to the Owner during 1994 are not longer
present. It is understood that the Contractor has improved significantly its ability to
avoid fissuring segments.
(d) A more significant problem of concern raised for the GML tunnel n. 8 was the
potential leakage, along the joints, in the future operation of the water transfer tunnel.
When asked about the measures taken at this time to make sure that no leakage will
ever occur along the tunnel length, the site manager said that grouting behind the
segments was being performed successfully as proven by the results of systematic
testing that were and are currently carried out.
(e) In the Consultant's opinion, given the importance for the project to reduce any risk
associated with water leakage from the tunnel, it is advisable to coat the inside of the
lining with a waterproofing product. Also, with consideration given to other tunnels to
be excavated with TBM (as is the case for the SML tunnel n.5), serious attention
should be given to the future use of rubber gaskets between the segments, to be
applied along the entire circumference of each ring.
(f) Based on the observation of the ground conditions at the downstream portal of the
GML tunnel n. 7, the Consultant's opinion is that the first metres of tunnel should be
excavated by conventional methods, proceeding from the portal into the ground so as
to reach a stable condition. It is strongly recommended that the TBM will not proceed
by excavating the GL tunnel n.8 in loess, from in out.
(g) The working conditions observed at the excavation face in the GML tunnel n. 9, on
both the upstream and downstream sides, cannot be considered to be safe as the head
and bench method being used, in conjunction with the type of support adopted, is not
appropriate and is not safe. This problem was carefully described and pointed out in
detail by previous consultant's who visited the site on August 1994.
(h) The technique adopted by placing concrete to form a vault (10-15 cm thick) on the
top heading in the GML tunnel n. 10 (it is understood that this technique was as well
applied when excavating in Q2 and Q3 loess, e.g. GML tunnel n. 9) is not in agreement
with the prescribed design by TIDI and furthermore is highly dangerous. It is clear that
the fresh concrete forming the vault has no initial strength and is not able to take any
load, should this occur as excavation proceeds at the face in soil-like ground.
(i) Another point of concern regarding the head and bench method used in the project
relates to the benching stage when the excavation of the sidewalls takes place just
below the foundation of the concrete vault. In addition, the removing support of the
same vault, excavation is being carried out in a zone which is highly stressed and prone
to instability, when the confinement offered by the ground in the bench area is being
4.4 - 2



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                 Final Rewort
taken away. A number of examples could be given by this Consultant where this
practice was the cause for collapse of tunnels, even when associated to appropriate
stabilization measures implemented on the top heading.
(j) With reference to the excavation and support sequences adopted in the GvL
tunnel n. 10, it must be stated that no attention was being paid to the adopted a
timely application of a ring of resistance when tunneling, independent of the use of
a reinforcement or a support. In fact, with the concrete invert installed more than
20-25 m behind the face, the soil surround will weak significantly (also considering
that the advance rate in the tunnel is reduced down to a minimum of I m/day) and
the tunnel will be characterized by a reduced safety factor.
(k) It is essential, when the excavation is to take place below the water table, that
appropriate provisions be take to avoid to encounter any sudden water inflow at the
leading (as anticipated in the preliminary design geological reports, this is mainly
expected along some lengths of the SML and NML). The need is to perform probings
ahead of the face in a systematic manner in order to be able to use appropriate
measures such as grout courtains in time. The recommendation is therefore to drill
long holes ahead, in order to be able to adopt grouting procedures when water inflows
are still limited.
(1) The excavation and support sequences used in rock, in the SML tunnel n. 7, are
similar to those adopted in soft ground such as N2 red clay and Q2, Q3 loess. This is
not appropriate or needed when excavating in a class m rock mass, even under a low
cover condition. It is therefore essential the appropriate support techniques, such as
rock bolting, shotcrete, wire mesh and still rbs, if required, be adopted. It is imperative
not to allow a Contractor to use working systems which are certainly suitable to the
limited equipment available, but are against safety and can give the tunnel a stability
condition which is not in accordance with design.
(m) It is important to point out that during the site visits no instrumentation for
monitoring purposes could be observed, also in the most difficult tunneling conditions
such as when excavating in soil. It must be understood by both YRDP and the
Contractor that careful observations and measurements of the performance of the
tunnel during construction are an essential part of the tunneling process. In addition to
maintaining safe conditions wvithin the tunnel during its construction, advance notice of
developing instability can be attained so as to be able to implement in time remedial or
stabilizing action.
4.4.2.3   Safety of Tunnel Workers
Requiring Item 4.4.2.2(g) above, YRDP has since changed the tunnel construction
being used, to employ shield-protected core boring Mnachines. These do furnish
adequate worker safety protection...
4.4.3   Silt Erosion Hazards
Because of the high turbidity of the Yellow River, the concern here is whether the
pumps and other equipment will be eroded by silt and thus not be able to function
throughout their design life period. The WWTP back-ground reports note that the
4.4 - 3



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final ReDort
turbidities will not exceed levels of 3,000 to 4,000 ppm and that this does not represent
a serious constraint to pump equipment suppliers.
4.4.4 Reservoir Intake Hazards/Frazile Ice
This hazard is whether there will be reservoir intake problems due to entry of ice
and/or "frazile". Frazile is a kind of ice mush which is rarely encountered in water
resource development project planning, hence the design must incorporate special
precautions to guard against this hazard.
In response to this problem, YRDP design staff have developed a special type of intake
design which involves use of a weir with a grill which wanns the faile to tun it into
harmless mush which is readily managed.
4A.5 Disposal of Tunnel Excavation Materials
This is a special problem for WWTP because of the large volume of tunnel excavation
materials to be disposed of. This issue is discussed in Section 4.11.4.
4.4.6 Silt Deposition Probedms
The concern here is whether the large volumes of silt in the imported water,
amnounting to 3% of the total volume, might interfere with WWTP operations.
The analysis of this problem, given in Section 4.9, shows that the engineering
planning does include provisions for satisfactory management of the problem.

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIrEW OF RESETTLEMENT
4.5 Environmental Review of Resettlement
4.5.1        Introduction
4.5.1.1      Purpose and Scope of Task
The purpose of Section 4.5 is to review and ensure the environmental soundness of the
RS plan presented in the environmental WWTP/RS Report, to ensure that the
recommended RS plan will include all attention to applicable environmental parameters
including effects on the RS families, on host villages/families, and affected
community/regional infrastructure services. These key parameters are shown in Figure
4.5.1-1. Also the plan must give needed attention to the timeliness of the various RS
process components, so that preparation of the new situation facilities (houses, land,
etc.) will ready for use at the scheduled time for moving residences and/or land uses.
The RS program of any water resource project is always a very sensitive environmental
issue, even when only the magnitude of the program is small with very few RS families
involved. Because WWTP does not include any new reservoir, the RS problem is
relatively small for the project components included in Phase I. However, for EIA
purposes, the overall ERR must also include Wanjiazhai reservoir, which has a large
RS problem, and the Huyan Water Treatment Plant, which involves urban RS
problems.
Figure 4.5.1-2 is a drawing for illustrating the overall ERA study. On the basis of the
types of RS problems involved, the overall study may be divided into the following
components:
(i) Wanjiazhai Reservoir: Full-scale RS.
(ii) Small-scale RS including disturbances for some rural housing and land
properties, for GML.
(iii)Land use only situations in rural areas, not involving loss of housing,
including SML and CWs.
(iv) Urban land disturbances, for Huyan RS.
The ERR evaluations give below utilize this classification of RS "sectors."
4.5.1.2 References utilized
The ERR is based primarily on review of the WWTP/RS Report of July 1996.
Additional references utilization are the folloving:
(I) Resettlement Plan of WWTP (WRDP) (Ref. 175)
(2) Resettlement Plan of Wanjiazhai Reservoir Areas (TIDI) (Ref. 176)

4.5.2     GML
4.5.2.1   RS Task
For the GML construction, 121.23 ha will be acquired and 47.64 ha leased. Within the
property line, there are 81 dwelling caves which have to be removed. This affected
population now living in caves who will require news houses at new sites are 54 of 16
households distributed in 6 villages of Pianguan County. In addition, 31 villages will be
affected as a result of land acquisition, with 188 people requiring production
arrangements. Table 4.5.2-1 shows the distribution of resettlers to be involved in the
GML.
4.5.2.2 ComRensation for Lost Property
Tianjin Survey and Design Institute has surveyed and recorded the physical indices of
the RS families. The land acquisition cost estimate has included compensation for the
houses (dwelling caves), house amenities (covered pens for animals, toilets, fences,
gateway arches, and storerooms), courtyard trees, and green crops. All these will be
adequately compensated using current prices.
With RS funds made available for ready use, all RS work for the GML had been
completed and all relocatees had moved to their new houses by February 1995.
4.5.2.3    Income in New Situation
According to applicable RS principles, all these 16 families will remain in agriculture
within their original villages. This will be beneficial for them to reestablish their
production and livelihood. Also, the relocatees will be subject to less psychological
stress and fewer other problems.
With availability of RS costs and preferential policies, RS families living standards will
be soon be reestablished and improved along with the increased capital construction on
farmland and agricultural input.
With production arrangements made by means of land redistribution, land terracing,
and unused land reclaiming, the 188 people requiring production arrangements will
also maintain and improve their production and livelihood levels.
As indicated by recent sample investigations, I5 families whose lands have been
acquired for GML are all living a much better life, with per capita incomes increased
from 100-833 in 1993 to the 2,000-5,000 range in 1995, a highest increase of 59 times,
and lowest increase of 2.3 times.
Periodic monitoring will be conducted for the future of RS families income levels.
4.5-2



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Project                                  Final Report
4.5.2.4    Compensation for Loss of Income Durine Transition
Such compensations (loss due to work interruption in new house building period) for
those needing new houses are already considered in the house compensation costs. As
for those only requiring production re-establishment, such compensations (loss due to
low productivity of newly created land or unused land in the early years) are included
in the land acquisition costs, which also include such compensations for the 13 small
quarries.
4.5.2.5    Rehabilitation to Prepare for New Jobs
The RS involved in the GML is relatively simple, involving only agricultural RS and
farmers. So RS resettlement will not represent a difficult task.
The target of RS trairning is resettlers who will have to change their previous farming
mode. Such training includes farming technologies, land terracing skills, and ecological
protection measures for developing unused land. Resettlers will learn from training
how to terrace their slopeland, and how to protect their land by engineering and
biological measures. This will result in better quality of terraced or newly improved/
created land, shorter transition period, and lower loss of incomes in such period.
RS training has been already incorporated in the training program which is a part of
the RS planning.
4.5.2.6    Compensations for Moving Cost
All the 16 RS families will be back moved to new sites at a very short distance from
their old houses. Nevertheless, the RS cost estimate includes compensations for their
moving costs, including transportation, loading/unloading, and living subsidies.
4.5.2.7    Housing and Housing Amenities
Out of the 81 dwelling caves to be removed, 77 are stones ones and the other 4 are
earth ones, an average of 5 persons for each family. These caves provide poor sunlight
and ventilation, being susceptible to high dumpiness and rat hazards.
New housing will be brick caves or brick/concrete houses. Most of them have 3
drawing rooms plus a central room. Also, each house is provided with such amenities
as a kitchen, storeroom, and courtyard with covered pen (for animals), fence and toilet.
With a building area of 100 m2, each can house 4 to 5 people. The cost is about 23,000
yuan. The RS planning includes typical housing models sh6wn in schematic drawings
and typical layouts of amenities.
Selection of the house models is up to the relocatees themselves. House compensation
costs are delivered to each family which is responsible for building a new house.
New houses are properly designed to be spacious, well-lighted, and moisture/rain
resistant, thus providing good safety and hygiene.
4.5-3



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                 Final Report
After RS, the quality of houses housing amenities will be certainly much better as
compared with the present conditions. This is also proven by the completed RS for
GML.
4.5.2.8    Social and Cultural Aspects
All the resettlers involved in the GME  will be "backmoved" within their original
villages. Consequently, their customs, cultural background and social relations will not
be significantly changed. They will not suffer from psychological stress as a result of
changed social or cultural background. They will continue to live with their own
communities.
No disabled people are involved in the RS. The RS planning has included adequate
consideration to women, the young, and the old people. The backmove RS plan will
impose no moving hardship on old people reluctant to move away from people they
know, and will make it unnecessary for children to change schools.
4.5.2.9    Complaints Management
Resettlers are entitled to complain for their perceived infringed legal interests. The RS
planning has established "RS Complaint/Grievance Channels" to ensure that resettlers
will be able to raise their complaints/grievances with: (i) social and cultural, (ii)
physical and psychological, and (iii) economic nature, and to receive proper solutions
to such.
The Village Administrative Committee is the primary organization responsible for
handling complaints for residence who feel their legal rights have not been primarily
compensated for. If no reasonable solution to problems can be obtained from the
Committee, then the resettlers have the right to complain to local governments, even to
higher level governments or Provincial governments. Since the beginning of WWTP,
no disputes have been found for both land acquisition compensation and resettlers'
arrangement. To date, no one has complained to the WWTP Administration.
4.5.2.10   Adequacy of Support Facilities at New Sites
As previously stated, the small RS population involved in the GML is scattered in 6
villages. These will be all backmoved. No new village is consequently planned to be
built. As these people will remain within their own villages, they will not cause any
impact on the capacity of the existing infrastructures.
The upcoming economic development and quality of life improvement will stimulate
the improvement of access roads, telecommunications facilities, medical services, and
drinking water supplies.
4.5.2.11   Host Communities
This concerns the following issues: (i) provision of enlarged community facilities
needed to support the incoming RS population; (ii) compensation for any lost income
4.5-4



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Project                                  Final Report
to the host communities; (iii) cultural conflicts with resettlers; and (iv) complaints by
host communities as for the RS families.
Because all of the movements are within the same communities, these issues should not
be a problem.
4.5.2.12 Summary and Conclusions
The RS Program for GML is relatively simple. All of the 54 relocatees have already
moved to new sites, and RS losses have been completely compensated and the
production arrangement for 118 people is underway. Land acquisition can be expected
to be completed by the end of 1996. Owing to direct involvement of the resettlers in
the building of the WWTP project, significantly higher living standards have been
reached in the participating localities in recent two years, with significantly improved
local living conditions in aspects of local communications and transportation,
telecommunications, lighting, and drinking water.
4.5.3     SML and Connection Works
4.5.3.1    RS Task
SML will require a total of 328.8 ha land, including 309.35 to be acquisitioned and
19.45 ha to be leased, whereas the figures for the Connection Works will be 15.58 ha
and 234.72 ha respectively. However, there are no residential structures or people
living on these lands. These two project components will affect a total of 43 villages
distributed in 18 township of 7 counties, with 934 people requiring production re-
establishment as shown in Table 4.5.3-1.
4.5.3.2    Compensation for Lost Property
Land acquisition for these two components will not involve any residential structures,
thus not involving any compensation for lost property.
4.5.3.3    Income in New Situation
All production arrangements for the SML will be agriculturally based. Those for the
Connection Works will be also mainly agriculturally based, plus some transportation,
animal husbandry, and aquaculture.
Agricultural RS will be accomplished by means of land redistribution, land terracing,
and unused land reclamation within the original villages, such that the per capita
farmland holding will not be reduced, or the productivity will be improved if the land
area will be reduced. Higher productivity may be achieved by turning dryland into
irrigated fields or vegetable plots, changing irrigated fields into vegetable greenhouses,
etc.
The land compensation costs will be applied to increasing agricultural input, launching
capital construction on farmland, and improving agricultural basic facilities. These will
4.5-5



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                 Final Report
ensure that the resettlers who lost land will soon reestablish their production and gain
more income.
In addition to agricultural RS, some non-agricultural RS will also be provided,
including sheep husbandry in Hekou Village, and transportation service in Luyukou
Village. Monitoring of resettlers' income levels is one of the important components of
the monitoring program for the overall project. Future income levels of these people
will be monitored and evaluated routinely.
4.5.3.4    Compensation for Loss of Income Durine Transition
Such compensations will be provided in the same way as delineated in Section 4.5.2.4.
4.5.3.5    Rehabilitation to Prepare for New Jobs
The resettlers to remain in agriculture will be provided with the same training as
discussed in 4.5.2.5. Those going to other sectors will be provided with technical
training such that they will be prepared for new jobs. Especially, drivers must be
specially trained to be qualified. Any driver without a license will not be permitted to
drive any vehicle. This aspect is already included in the training program which is a
part of the RS planning.
4.5.3.6    Compensation for Movine
Because the SML and Connection Works will not move any people away from their
homes, no compensation for moving will be required.
There is no industry in the land area to be used for the SML.
Within the land area to be used for the Connection Works, there are 7 small coking
industries, I prefabricating factory, and I quarry. The planned cost estimates (2.8075
million yuan) for these have already included compensations for moving.
4.5.3.7    Housing and Housine Amenities
Both SML and Connection Works will involve no transfer of people, and thus no
house construction.
As future production and livelihood development goes on, the housing and housing
amenities of resettlers expected to be improved.
4.5.3.8    Social and cultural Aspects
Both SML and Connection Works will involve no transfer of people, and thus no
social or cultural aspects.
4.5.3.9    Complaints Management
Refer to Section 4.5.2.9 of this chapter.
4.5-6



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                  Final Report
4.5.3.10   Adequacv of Support Facilities at New Site
Production arrangements for resettlers will not involve any new houses or new
villages. So the newcomers will not pose any additional load on the existing
infrastructures.
Future economic development and quality of life improvement will bring improvements
to the existing community facilities.
4.5.3.1 1 Summarv and Conclusions
There are no residential structures or people living on lands which are acquisitioned,
with only 934 people requiring production re-establishment. All production
arrangements for the SML will be agriculturally based, and those for the Connection
Works will be also mainly agnrculturally based, plus some transportation, animal
husbandry, and aquaculture.
Detailed specifications have been given in the RS Plan for SML and CWs for
compensation principles and compensation investment for land, trees and small scale
township enterprises. All these will be reasonably compensated. A training plan has
been prepared for all resettlers which is believed to be sensible and practicable.
Stratified surveys have shown that the resettlers in the project zones where WWTP
works have started have significantly increased their income.
4.5.4     RS Impacts by Wanjiazhai Dam/Reservoir
4.5.4.1   RS Task
4.5.4.1.1  Introduction
In the Wanjiazhai damsite area, a total of 498.8 ha land will be acquired, including
194.4 ha farmnland (39%). The reservoir will inundate 638.6 ha land, including 337.6 ha
farmland, accounting for 52.9%.
4.5.4.1.2   Damsite Area RS
On the left bank, 3,964 m2 uninhabited and abandoned houses and dwelling caves in
Wanjiazhai Village will be removed from the land to be acquired, but no transfer of
people will be involved. On the right bank, 2,473 m2 houses and dwelling caves in
Yaozimao and Shidaoqing Villages will be relocated together with 24 residents.
Wanjiazhai Village will lose 79% farmland as a consequence of land acquisition. In
1994, 500 villagers (including 248 labor forces) were all transferred to non-agricultural
status in 1994. Production arrangements will be required for 164 people from the other
villages involved.
4.5-7



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                  Final Report
The damsite resettlers will be backmoved within their original villages. On the left
bank, production arrangements will be land based, plus industrial, animal husbandry
and aquaculture, and tertiary industry (service trades). All of the resettlers on the right
will remain in agriculture.
4.5 4.1.3   Reservoir Area RS
The reservoir inundation will involve 70 villages and 5 county industries distributed in
10 townships of 3 counties governed by Shanxi and Inner Mongolia, as well as No.
109 national road and No. 701 Yellow River highway bridge.
In the reservoir area, a total of 142,100 m2 houses and dwelling caves will be
inundated, including 60,000 m2 (7.9%) in Shanxi and 136,100 m2 (95.8%) in Inner
Mongolia.
The population to be directly inundated will be 4,645. In addition, 1,402 people will
lose their lands but keep their housing. By the moving year (1998), the total RS
population will be 6,482.
These people will be backmoved within the original township or relocated, in group, to
adjacent places within the same county, except a few who will be backmoved within
their original villages. It is planned to provide 22 new villages.
As a result of inundation, production arrangements will be required for 6,430 people,
including 5,085 planned to be resettled in agriculture, 1,210 going to secondary
industry (farm) and tertiary industry (trade services), and 135 preferring self
employment.
4.5.4.2    Compensation for Lost Property
Tianjin Survey and Design Institute has surveyed and recorded the physical indices of
the families to be involved in both damsite and reservoir areas, and has completed
breakdown cost estimates for reestablishing housing and housing amenities on the basis
of the current prices with consideration for escalation (7% per year). For cost
estimating, the housing is divided into 8 categories, such as brick-concrete, stone-
concrete, brick-timber, and brick-timber. Housing amenities include gateway arches,
fences, vegetable cellars, toilets, pigsties, sheep pens, chicken houses and others,
altogether 12 categories. Such detailed cost estimate will ensure that all properties to
be lost will be adequately compensated.
The RS from the damsite area was completed by the .end of 1995, including cost
estimates. The resettlers are reported to be satisfied with the compensations they have
received.
The resettlers to be affected in the reservoir area will be relocated as the project
proceeds. The first moving year will be 1998.
4.5-8



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiecat                                   Final Report
The RS planning will consider any new structures found to be needed during the
period from the physical index survey to the moving year. Such will also be properly
compensated.
4.5.4.3    Income at New Site
The RS planning will allow the resettlers to maintain and improve their production and
livelihood as early as possible.
Agricultural RS will be carried out by means of land redistribution, irrigated land
creation, land terracing, and unused land reclamation. After RS, the per capita land
holding will be higher as compared with the before RS situation. Land compensations
will be applied to improving agricultural facilities for higher land productivity. Training
will be provided for farmers to learn how to manage their farmland in a scientific
manner- These will allow the resettlers to maintain or improve their income levels in
the shortest time. The following is comparison of the projected before versus after RS
income levels of the reservoir area resettlers:
Item       Per Capita Farmland (ha) Per Capita Grain(kg)  Annual Income (vuan)
Before RS           0.12                465                  1,025
AfterRS             0.14                573                  1,347
The economic income analysis of Wanjiazhai resettlers, who were transferred to non-
agricultural status in 1995, indicated an annual income per labor force of 3,444 yuan.
The per capita income is 1,708 yuan which is 13.4 times as much as the value of 127
yuan in 1990 before the commencement of the project, and 1.4 times as much as the
value of 1,200 yuan in 1994. This implies that the RS planning is adequate and feasible.
The reservoir area RS will represent a heavy task which will last a long time period. So
RS monitoring will be especially important.
4.5.4.4    Compensation for Loss of Income During Transition
The RS planning has paid adequate consideration to such compensations for various
incomes to be lost during the transition period. These are included in the land
compensation costs, and compensations for moving and for production interruption.
4.5.4.5    Rehabilitation to Prepare for New Jobs
A detailed RS training program has been formulated as a part of the RS planning.
Technical training will allow resettlers to master new technologies and skills required
for new jobs and higher incomes.
With large RS populations, detailed RS schemes will greatly vary. So training services
will be arranged to fit into this feature, with different training services provided, as
necessary. Those to remain in agriculture will be trained in the field of
vegetable/flower/edible mushroom planting, and in poultry and animal husbandry, in
addition to what is stated in Section 4.5.2.5.

Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                     Final Report
New RS workers will be trained before employed in secondary industry (farm) and
tertiary industry (services), as distinguished from major manufacturing, (first category).
Training costs are included in the RS planning, and all training services will be
implemented under the control of RS supervisors.
4.5.4.6    Compensation for Moving
The RS from the reservoir area will have large populations, long distances, and
significant moving costs. The RS planning will include adequate compensations for
moving.
The RS planning prepared by Tianjin Survey and Design Institute includes the
following 4 break-downs of such compensations:
Item     Transport Cost Loss in     Subsidv for Work     Subsidy for
In Moving    Moving        Work Interruption   Medicine
Amount
(yuan/person)   300   50            100                  20
Based on the above rates, the total of such compensations is estimated at 2.8336
million yuan; which is already incorporated into the RS total cost estimate.
4.5.4.7    Housing and Housing Amenities
The housings in the reservoir area is mainly earth/stone caves and stone-timber houses.
After RS, brick-concrete houses with 3 drawing rooms plus a central room will be
provided for each family. It is certain that the resettlers' housing and housing amenities
will be considerably improved (See Section 4.5.2.7). In particular, new houses will be
provided at properly selected sites for the resettlers from the reservoir area. With
overall planning made in accordance with the "Principles for Township Planning", such
new houses will have proper layouts and be well lighted. Provision of adequate
communities facilities and access roads will also improve the living conditions.
4.5.4.8    Social and Cultural Aspects
All those to be moved from the damsite and reservoir areas are involuntary resettlers.
Resettlers are often reluctant to leave their homes and are concerned with the customs
of and the relations with the host communities. They are afraid they may be pushed
aside and humiliated.
To relieve this psychological stress, all resettlers will be backmoved within the original
townships or moved to adjacent townships but still within the same county. In detail,
22 new villages will be built for the RS in groups, using the following criteria:
(a)    Resettlers will be moved in groups, except for a few to be backmoved
within the original villages, and will be allowed to live separatel) from
the host community people.
4.5-10



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project                                   Final Report
(b)    RS villages must be incorporated into the host administrative and
socioeconomic systems. Arrangement will be made so host township
governments will cooperate to ensure successful transition of RS.
(c)    The allocations of land for both housing and production purposes of the
resettlers will be managed by the local county governments, rather than
directly with the host people.
These measures will minimize potential conflicts between the resettlers and the host
communities, and possible psychological stress of resettlers by the host exclusivism.
4.5.4.9    Complaints Management
Details are given in Section 4.5.2.9 of this chapter.
4.5.4.10   Adequacy of Support Facilities at New Villages
Better infrastructures, such as access roads, communications facilities, medical and
education amenities, water supply systems, and power supply facilities, will be built at
new villages. The RS planning has included the capital costs for the provision of such
facilities, including:
(a)    New land site with leveling at a total cost estimate of 3.0229 million
yuan.
(b)   Water supply (for drinking and irrigation use) and drainage at a total of
11.234 million yuan, involving the provision of 16 pumping stations, 12
motor wells, and 102 big-collar wells for rural RS sites, plus 4 drinking
water supply projects for industrial RS sites. The costs for water will be
at a low level because resettlers will be entitled to preferential policies.
(c)    Power supply at a total cost of 1.4589 million yuan, which will be used
to provide 81.05 km low-voltage user lines, with 10 KV and low-
voltage mains considered in special planning.
(d)   Provision of 14.19 km roads in villages at a total cost of 1.419 million
yuan, with access roads considered in special planning.
(e)    Provision of public broadcasting lines at a total cost of 602,200 yuan.
The RS planning is adequate in all these aspects. In addition, primary schools and
clinics will be established for densely populated and concentrated villages, for
providing easy access to education and medical services. The RS planning includes the
improvement of existing schools and clinics, and it is not considered necessary to
construct any new facilities.
4.5.4.11     Host Communities
4.5-11



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Project                                    Final Report
All of the aspects relating to both resettlers and host communities, as mentioned in
Section 4.5.2.11, have been adequately considered in the RS planning. Regarding items
(i) and (ii), the following measures are included in the RS plan:
(a)    Provision of special facilities, including establishment and improvement
of roads, power facilities, public broadcasting lines, and communication
facilities in the reservoir area.
(b)   Improvement of schools and medical facilities, including renovation of
the existing middle/primary schools and clinics in the receiving areas.
(c)    Construction of  irrigation works, involving irrigation and drinking
water supply projects (with power supply at preferential price).
Most of the resettlers from the reservoir area will be moved and rehabilitated in
groups. As a result, they are not expected to have conflicts of customs and cultures
with host communities. Complaints in respect of receiving resettlers, if any, may be
raised by the host people through the RS complaints channels.
4.5.4.12    Summary and Conclusions
The WWTP involves arrangements for 24 resettlers from the damsite and 6,482
resettlers from reservoir area. The damsite resettlers will be backmoved within their
original villages or to adjacent places within the same county. Some 22 new villages
will be built. RS plan includes consideration of new village's public infrastructure and
of RS area's public infrastructure, with estimation of funds required. RS has been
completed in 1995. Surveys have shown that the resettlers satisfy with compensation
and have higher living standards. The residents in the reservoir area will be resettled in
1998 and compensation cost will be estimated according to current price in 1996,
considering an annual rate of 7% price rise.
As a result of relocation in groups, the resettlers from the reservoir area are not
expected to have conflicts of customs and cultures with host communities. With
preferential electricity price provided by WWTP and the preferential policy provided
by the State Government and Shanxi Provincial Government, the resettlers are
expected to reach higher production and living standards in a rapid manner.
4.5.5      Taiyuan Municipal Water Supply System Improvements
4.5.5.1    RS Proaram
Land will acquired for the Huyan Treatment Plant in the north outskirts of the city and
for a new pumping station on North Jianhe Road. Construction of the pumping station
will replace the existing brick factory operated by the Jinan Chemical Plant, only
involving compensation for land and fixed assets, without any requirement for
production arrangements. For the new treatment plant, 29.7 ha land will be acquired
from Huyan Village, thus requiring production arrangements for 96 villagers.
4.5-12



WVaniiazhai Water Transfcr Proiect                               Final Report
The village is located at the contact area between Taiyuan city proper and outskirts,
with few farmland holdings but complicated land uses. Considering the geographic
situation, these people will be settled in the following non-agricultural activities:
(a)   A total investment of 5.326 million yuan will be used to set up a
transportation company for 30 resettlers, who will earn an average
income of 6,000-12,000 yuan each year.
(b)   A total amount of 5.06 million yuan will be used for the development of
Lijiamao orchard, which will provide an annual income of 6,000 yuan
for 33 people.
(c)   A welfare fund will be established, by depositing 791,200 yuan of the
land compensations in banks, to provide 2,000 yuan/year living subsidy
for each person, each minor child, who together represent 35% of the
total RS population.
Because the affected population is small, this part of RS will have similar impacts as
stated in Section 4.5.3. The land compensations have all been reimbursed.
4.5.5.2    Evaluation of RS program
Yuyan Village is located at the immediate outskirts of Taiyuan City, where villagers'
agricultural income accounts only for about 3% of their total income, while the
remaining 97%  is from  industry, transportation and other trade activities. So
agricultural arrangements are not required for those villagers who are affected by land
acquisition. The three measures presented in RS program are considered appropriate
and practical, and should satisfy the desires of the resettlers.
Jinan Pumping Station will occupy the land under the jurisdiction of Jinan Chemical
Plant, which will not involve production arrangements. After negotiation, enough
compensation for land acquisition will have been finished, which is satisfactory for both
sides.
4.5.6 Summary Evaluation
Figure 4.5-1 summarizes the ERR evaluation of the WWTP/RS program and Phase
LIRS report. Review of Figure 4.5-1 indicates that all of the RS programs have been
reasonably well planned, for all four RS components. While there are some gaps in the
tabulation, the overall indication is positive. However, YRDP/EMO should more ahead
to implement the periodic ERR monitoring recommended above, and also should give
attention to the program on monitoring to be done by Wanjiazhai/EMO and by EPB
for Huyan (See Tables 4.5.6-10 and 4.5.6-1 1). This will include checking on programs
on the RS training program shown in Table 4.5.6-12.
An indication of the comprehensiveness of the RS planning by YRDP/RS Team is
given by Tables 4.5.6-1 to 12, which summarize the RS program work for GML,
SML, CWs on the following issues:

report.
4.5.7 EMO's Responsibilities in RS
The EMO for the Phase I project will take the following responsibilities: for checking
on the environmental aspect of the RS program WWTP/Phase I components, including
(i) review of completed RS planning to ensure that all of the aforesaid issues have been
included; (ii) periodic monitoring to ensure that RS progress proceeds as planned; and
(iii) based on (ii), to recommend needed improvement.
For Wanjiazhai, it is recommended that the EMO carry out surveillance of the
Wanjiazhai's own EMO with respect to RS program. Similarly the WWTP/EMO
should carry out surveillance for Taiyuan City's RS program for the Huyan treatment
plant and North Jianhe pumping station. It is also recommended that the Expert Panel
to be established by YRDP on EIA/RS should give needed attention to the Wanjiazhai
and Huyan-North Jianhe RS programs.

SECTION 4.6
PUBLIC HEALTH
4.6    PUBLIC HEALTH
4.6.1  Introduction
Water resource development projects generally pose significant public health disease
transmission hazards, for both enteric diseases and insect vector diseases. The EIA for
the Xiaolangdi project (Ref 203), which is nearby and in this same general region of
China, is valuable as a guideline for assessing the potential hazards for WWTP.
The early EIA studies for WWTP did not include significant attention to the public
health issue, hence the EIA team initiated its work by reviewing the Xiaolangdi
experience, and by consulting with the Provincial Anti-Epidemic Station (AES) with an
initial meeting on 9 October 1995 (See notes in Annex D). The EIA team found the
AES, although not familiar with the Xiaolangdi work, to be knowledgeable on the
disease hazards to be posed by WWTP and very interested in using their capabilities
for assisting in environmental management of WWTP. At the request of the EIA
Team, the AES prepared a report on "Enteric and Insect Vector Diseases Control in
WWTP Area" in December 1995.
The present write-up is based on the information furnished by AES as well as the
Xiaolangdi experience.
It should be noted that many of the disease hazards associated with water resource
development projects stem from construction of dams/reservoirs, and the WWTP
Phase I Project does not include any dams/reservoirs, excepting use of the Wanjiazhai
reservoir (under construction by MWR) as the water source and use of the existing
Fen-I reservoir for water control purposes.
4.6.2 General Disease Statistics in Study Area
4.6.2.1 Study Area and Subjects Evaluated
An investigation on public health was conducted by CIRP in May 1996 and the data
furnished by AES are summarized.
The study area for investigation of public health covers Pianguan, Shenchi, Ningwu
and Jingle of Xinzhou Prefecture, and Loufan and Gujiao Counties of Taiyuan City.
The investigation involves populations, death rates, common diseases, endemic
diseases, communicable diseases, causes of death, cancers, and expected lifespan.
4.6.2.2 Results and Analysis
(a)    Population, death and expected lifespan
4.6- 1



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project                                    Final Report
(a. l)  Populations in the study areas are as shown in Table 4.6.2-1 which shows that
the sex percentage (ratio of males to females) here (112-126) is higher than the
nation's average of 106.
(a.2)  Statistic data included in Table 4.6.2-2 indicate that the death rates in rural
areas are higher than they are in urban areas.
(a.3)  The expected average lifespan is an overall index to reflect public health in
different areas. As shown in Table 4.6.2-3, the expected lifespan of females is
generally three years longer than that of males, approximating the provincial
average, with varying growth rates as compared to 1981.
(b)    Common Diseases
The common diseases in the study area are mainly circulation system diseases,
respiratory system diseases, digestive system diseases, communicable diseases, TB,
cancer, and urinary system diseases. Also, seasonable diseases are very common, for
example, enteritis, dysentery, and other enteric diseases prevail in the summer, and
tracheitis, bronchitis, and other respiratory diseases in the winter.
(c)    Communicable Diseases
Communicable diseases in the study area mainly include hepatitis, bacillary dysentery,
bovillae, bronchocephalitis, and encephalitis as listed in Table 4.6.2-4.
As shown in Table 4.6.2-4, the incidence of hepatitis and dysentery is generally higher,
especially in Taiyuan, Loufan and Gujiao. This may relate to the fact that urban areas
are densely populated and people here move around more often.
(d)    Endemic Diseases
In the study area, 4 endemic diseases are found (Table 4.6.2-5). The former two are
caused by the deficiency of iodine, while the latter two diseases in Xinzhou Prefecture
relate to high contents of fluorine in drinking water, and also to air pollution by coal
smoke.
(e)    Mortality Data
As illustrated in Table 4.6.2-6, the causes of death rankling from first to sixth are
similar, but rates and ranks vary from place to place.
(f)    Rates of Death Caused by Cancer
The rates and adjusted rates of death caused by cancer are described in Table 4.6.2-7,
while Table 4.62.-8 includes the adjusted rates by disease. The adjusted rates in
Taiyuan are higher than those in Xinzhou Prefecture, approximating the provincial
averages. Table 4.6.2-8 shows that the adjusted rates considered in terms of diseases
are lower in Xinzhou Prefecture, and lower than those in Taiyuan City and Shanxi
Province.

4.6.3 Public Health Hazards from WWTP
4.6.3.1 Enteric Disease Hazards
(a)    Construction Workers
This is the hazard of epidemic of enteric diseases, such as typhoid and dysentery, which
likely will occur if proper precautions are not taken during the construction stage
including (i) medical examination of all construction workers (to screen out "carriers")
and continuing medical checking of the workers, and (ii) provision of adequate
sanitation facilities including safe drinking water (so this always has a positive chlorine
residual), sanitary excreta management, and sanitary management of solid wastes, plus
continuing monitoring to ensure continuing safe/sanitary conditions.
AES is well aware of this hazard, especially because of very serious typhoid epidemics
which occurred during construction of Fen-l reservoir in 1958 (over 1,000 cases) and
of Wenyu reservoir in 1960 (700 cases).
(b)    Resettlement Villages
The need here is to ensure that resettlement homes are furnished with safe drinking
water (chlorine residual in tap water) and sanitary excreta management, and that the
method selected for solid waste management is sanitary. This is part of the job of
resettlement planning.
4.6.3.2 Insect Vector Disease Hazards
For Xiaolangdi these includes malaria, encephalitis, and rat-carried haemorragic fever
(HF). The AES experience indicates that malaria has not been a problem in Shanxi
province but both encephalitis and HF are significant.
(a)    Encephalitis
The control program  should comprise two measures:  (i)  periodic spraying of
construction zone buildings with insecticide (for mosquito control for both encephalitis
and malaria), and (ii) periodic larval surveys in the vicinity of WWTP reservoirs to
detect presence of mosquito species for encephalitis and malaria, say every six months.
(b)    Haemorragic Fever
This was first detected in Shanxi province in 1981 and an epidemic occurred in 1984-
85 (1,000 cases), and since there have been 100 to 200 cases per year. The control
program for new reservoirs for WWTP should include: (i) killing of rats in areas to be
inundated, and (ii) monitoring of rat densities in the construction zone buildings, with
killings of rats as needed, and (iii) monitoring of rat densities in villages/homes around
the reservoir areas, before, during and after construction, in order to establish the
existing level of rat densities and any increase due to the project, and when increases
occur, to use control measures to reduce the densities to the "normal" levels. Only
Item (ii) applies to WWTP/Phase I.

4.6.3.3 Concerns of AES
As noted in the memo of the 9 October meeting with AES, AES has made three
submittals to various agencies, including YRDP and the Provincial Government, on
AES' concerns about. WWTP with suggested disease control measures (Refs. 133.1,
133.2, 133.3).  Also as previously noted, AES prepared an updated report in
December 1995, on its recommendations to be considered by WWTP.
4.6.3.4 Statistics for Key Diseases Affected by WWTP
As noted above, the specific types of diseases which can be expected to be affected by
WWTP are the enteric and insect-vector diseases. Summarized data for these, obtained
from AES' December 1995 report, are given in Tables 4.6.3-1 and 2.
Review of these data indicates the following:
(i) Mortality rates for hepetatis are quite low compared to rates in other nearby
provinces. However, Shanxi typhoid morbility rates are about the same as
national rates and rates for nearby provinces.
(ii) Encephalitis, malaria, and haemorragic rates in Shanxi Province are quite low
compred to national rates and also considerably lower than in nearby provinces.
Probably this is because Shanxi Province is relatively dry.
(iii)Within Shanxi Province, both enteric and insect vector disease rates are higher
in the southem part (compared to the north) because of warmer and less arid
conditions.
4.6.4 Recommended Action Program
4.6.4.1 Enteric Diseases
The WWVTP construction program should include provisions for protection against
outbreaks of enteric diseases such as typhoid and dysentery, by (i) provision of
adequate water supply and sanitation facilities for construction workers and (ii)
medical examination (initial and periodic) for construction workers. Also the housing
buildings for construction workers should be periodically sprayed with insecticides for
mosquito control. These measures which are the same as now being employed for
Xiaolangdi, are described in Section 4.11.
4.6.4.2 Insect Vector Diseases
While Phase I Project will not finanice any dams/reservoirs nor any irrigation facilities,
hence Phase I will not affect these diseases. For any future reservoirs to be built, the
construction operations for these reservoirs should include the EPMs for preventing
outbreakls of haemorragic fever and malaria and encephalitis. It is recommended that
the Phase I Project should include close check on incidence of these three diseases in
the overall WWTP region and if any significant increases occur in any of these, then

Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project                                 Final Report
special control measures should be implemented including routine monitoring of
pertinent mosquito control, rat control as indicated.
During Phase I it will be necessary to monitor rat densities in the construction zones,
which may tend to increase due to the food available there, and if significant increases
occur, rat killing measures should be carried out to prevent increases in haemorragic
fever due to the project.
4.6.4.3 Summarized Action Program
The summarized action program is shown in Figure 4.6.4-1
4.6.4.4 Role of AES
YRDP should make optimal use of AES participation in the recommended action
program.

SECTION 4.7
ECOLOGY
4.7.1 Introduction
The purpose of Section 4.7 is to ascertain xvhether WNTP involves hazards to the
ESA ecology (biological resources) and if so to delineate the needed EPMs.
Pertinent background information is given in References 101, 102, 108, 109, 120, 127,
130 and 135, which is primarily related to the GMIL, NMNL, SML, Connection Works
and the four reservoirs. The information is considered to be sufficient for EIA
purposes. The detailed ecological background in ESA is described in Section 3.5.
The impacts of the construction of the TWO individual reservoirs on ecology are
separately discussed in Section 4.8.
4.7.2 Natural Forests
As noted in Section 3.5, the areas the 'WW'TP passes are mainly mountainous and hilly
areas and are already "humanized". There is little natural forest existing in the ESA.
No significant impacts on natural forests is expected due to the construction and
operation of the project.
4.7.3 Vegetation
Because the unfavorable climate (Section 3.4.2) , landform (Section 3.4.9), and soils
(Section 3.4.4), the vegetation coverage rate in the ESA is quite low with an average
rate of about 60 percent. The flora composition in the ESA consists mainly of
temperate semi-dry steppes, firewood and bush, secondary xerophyte coniferous
forest, and cultivated crops. The land occupied by the project is mostly covered with
brush and crops.
The vegetation coverage in the four reservoir areas and the areas of transmission lines
above ground will be mostly inundated or destroyed, which will change the local flora
composition. However it is believed that this change of the eco-svsiem is limited to
the local area and will not produce significant impacts on the flora cornposition and
distribution in the region.
As noted in Section 4.14 and Section 4.2, during construction some 747.7 ha land will
be occupied by construction operations. Of this about 301.7 ha will be occupied
temporarily. This will have impacts on the vegetation coverage in the area.
Resurfacing and revegetation measures have been designed and required for denuded
and refilled areas to reduce and offset the impacts.

Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                   Final Revort
4.7.4 Wildlife
4.7.4.1 Terrestrial Animals
The WVWTP will have some direct and indirect impacts on the wildlife environment.
Construction of the reservoirs will of course eliminate the inundated areas as terrestrial
wildlife habitat, and similarly the above-ground facilities of the transmission lines will
result in some habitat loss. However, this loss of habitat is not expected to create
significant impacts on the terrestrial animals because the wild animals will still have
ample habitat areas and most of the rare animals such as Felis pardus and Aquila
chrysctos live in remote steep mountains or gullies. This habitat will not be significantly
affected by the construction and operation of the project.
The disturbance and interruption of the animal habitat environment caused by
construction workers and construction operations will force some animals to move out
during the construction stage, especially in the section of the SML along Luliang
Mountain. Many resource animals like Phasianus colcicus and Lepus capensis, which
are now plentiful, will be affected in quantity and species during the construction stage.
It is required that non-production hunting be prevented and controlled during the
construction stage and that all denuded and refilled areas be revegetated at completion
of destruction. The resulting net effect on animal habitat should be of minor
significance.
4.7.4.2 Birds
At present, as discussed in Section 3.5, there are more than 99 species of birds in the
areas along transmission lines. The dominant species are Passer morntanus, Pica pica
and E. cioides. Construction of reservoirs will of course alter the aquatic ecology as
discussed in Section 4.8. New water bodies and swamp habitats will be favorable for
waterfowls Podiceps cristatus, A poecilorhyncha, Anas acuta and other wading birds
will come into this district, which will make the bird composition more complicated.
The bird composition will be dominated by waterfowl instead of songbirds which are
currently the dominant birds in the area. However it is expected that this change will be
confined to the areas surrounding the reservoirs and will not produce significant effects
on the local regional bird composition and distribution due to the limited scale of the
reservoirs to be built.'
4.7.5 Aquatic Ecology
4.7.5.1 Aquatic Plants
It is expected that the new aquatic plants like Potamr'ogeton polygonifolius and
helophyte, such as Alisma Plantago community, will be introduced by the imported
water into Fen-1 reservoir and other in the GML/SML system. These can be expected
to continue to exist in these reservoirs, which will diversify aquatic plant composition.
Introduction of the Wanjiazhai species into the Fen River similarly will lead to increase
in species diversity.  In general the impact of WWTP on Fen River and Fen-l
Reservoir aquatic ecology should be a significant improvement because there is little
valuable aquatic ecology there now because of river pollution. The WWTP expected

to enforce meaningful pollution control measures wvhich should lead to re-
establishment of a meaningful aquatic ecology in the river reach within the ESA.
4.7.5.2 Aquatic Animals
The fishery in the ESA is only a very small part of the local economy. The densities of
the fish species, such as Crucian carps and Loach are small. Fish can be found only in
parts of the river reaches during flood seasons. The water diversion therefore is not
expected to produce any significant impacts on the local fishery. However, the EMO's
monitoring program should include some periodic checking in changes in fish species
and quantities due to the project following introduction of the new water. As noted in
Section 4.7.5.1, the WWTP should markedly reduce pollution discharges to the Fen
River reach within ESA, and the resulting new habitat could lead to establishment of a
meaningful fishery in this reach of the river.
4.7.6 Summary and Conclusions
The WWTP/Phase I will convey water to the Taivuan Service Area by passing throuah
the following areas in sequence, (i) mountainous zone, where the facilities are
underground, (ii) the Fen river, over a reach of some 81.2 km, (iii) the Connection
Project region, for delivery of water from Fen-l reservoir to the Taiyuan Service Area.
Effects on ecology in the mountainous zone will be negligible because the system
facilities are essentially underground.
There will be an impact on the Fen River reach utilized for conveyance, both for flora
and fauna.  Because the overall WVXTTP will include rigid control of pollution
discharges to the river, and because WWTP will add clean fresh water which will
increase the river flow volume, the river water quality should be significantly improved
and this should significantly improve habitats for both flora and fauna.  The
introduction of different species from Wanjiazhai reservoir could also be helpful in
improving species diversity.
Introduction of the imported fresh water and new species to Fen-l reservoir, and to
other reservoirs in the system, plus pollution control measures, improve reservoir
water quality and hence improve habitats for both flora and fauna. The introduction of
new species from Wanjiazhai could be helpful including improvement in species
diversity.
The natural ecology in both the Connection Works area of Taiyuan Service Area have
been essentially displaced by existing development.

SECTION 4.8
RESERVOIR ELAs
4.8.1 Introduction
4.8.1.1    Earlier Reservoir EIAs
Earlier EIAs for WWTP have discussed the environemntal impacts by Wanjiazhai,
Daliang, Zhaojiaxiaocun, and Haoshuigou reservoirs, and details on this can be found
in relevant EIAs (see Ref 130, 101, 102). Considering that the present EIA covers
only WWTP Phase I, Section 4.8 is limited to discussion of Wanjiazhai reservoir as the
source of WWTP water and Fen-I reservoir which is utilized as part of the water
convey scheme. Fen-l reservoir is an old reservoir which has been operating for nearly
35 years, and possible environmental effects due to the changed operation pattem will
be evaluated on the basis of the present environmental description. However, the other
reservoirs mentioned above, namely Daliang, Zhaojiaxiaocun, and Haoshuigou
reservoirs, are not included in this pesent EIA.
4.8.1.2    Purposes of Section 4.8
The purposes of Section 4.8 are essentially: (i) to review the studies done by various
Chinese institutions on EIAs for the two project reservoirs (Wanjiazhai and Fen-1), to
check these for EIA adequacy for all SEIs involved in reservoir projects excepting the
issue of resettlement (handled in Section 4.5), (ii) to identify gaps in these EIAs, (iii)
arranging for additional work needed to fill gaps, and (iv) to derive conclusions on the
overall environmental soundness for each project.
4.8.2 Approach Used by EIA Team
The approach to Task 4.8 is based on preparation, for each of the two reservoirs, of a
matrix which shows the information available in the background references (Annex A)
as related to each item of interest to be included in a typical reservoir EIA.
Table 4.8.2-1 shows the data available for EIA for Wahjiazhai reservoir
Table 4.8.2-2 shows the data available for EIA for Fen-l reservoir.
4.8.3        Wanjiazhai Reservoir
4.8.3.1 Introduction
Wanjiazhai Reservoir is the water source of WWTP, which is presently being
constructed by the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR). Since it is not a component
of WWA'TP, main attention, from EIA point of view, is given to the dam stability, water
availability, and water quality, which would have significant impacts on WWTP. Other
EIA issues are discussed briefly based on the data available (Ref. 125, 130, 147).

Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                  Final Report
In its "Preliminary Review Comments on the Feasibility study Report on Wanjiazhai
Water Project on Yellow River, 1984", MWR indicated that the main purposes of
Wanjiazhai Water Project were power generation and water supply.
The power station of the project will be part of North China Electric Power Network
which is seriously short of power. The network has to switch off some circuits to limit
the electricity consumption in peak times. The Wanjiazhai Power Station with an
installed capacity of 1,080 MW will provide needed peak regulation capacity.
The industrial and agricultural production and construction in Shanxi Province as well
as Junggar of Inner Mongolia is seriously restricted by lack of water resources.
Wanjiazhai Reservoir, when completed in 1993, would supply 1,400 million m3 water
to the two provinces of which 200 million m3 is for Junggar of Inner Mongolia and 640
for Taiyuan service area and 560 for the Pinshuo and Datong service areas of Shanxi
Province.
4.8.3.2   Project Description
(a) Location and Components
The Wanjiazhai Water Project is situated in the valley of Yellow River northstem
stream section between the Toketo and Longkou. The dam site is at 390 34'N and
111   26'E near Wanjiazhai Village, Pianguan County, Shanxi Province. Figure 4.8.3-1
shows the location of the project.
The project consists mainly of a concrete gravity dam, water release structures, a
power station and its intake structures, and water intake structures for WWTP, all as
shown in Figure 4.8.3-2.
(b) Desizn Criteria
The main features and design criteria of the project are listed in Table 4.8.3-1.
4.8.3.3   Environmental Setting
(a) Environmental Study Area
The ESA for Wanjiazhai Reservoir is described in Section 3.2.2 (a) and is shown in
Figure 3.2.2-1.
(b) Land Use
The land in the reservoir area is mostly covered with loess and is mainly used as
farmland. The crops are mainly millet and broom corn millet. Because of extensive
farming and serious soil erosion, the-land is infertile and has low output (30-40 kig/mu).
(c)  Natural Phvsical Resources
(c.l) Climate
The reservoir area is in the arid and semiarid hilly land of the loess plateau wvith
continental climate in the temperate zone. The annual average temperature is about

between day and night. The winter is dry, windy, and dusty as well as severely cold
with freezing period of S months. The observed maximum annual average wind speed
is 12.5 m/s, while the recorded maximum wind speed reached 20 m/s. The average
annual precipitation is 300-500 mm while the annual evaporation is nearly 2,000 mm.
Refer to Section 3.3.4 for the climate of Pianguan County.
(c.2) Topooraphy
The landform of the two banks of the reservoir area is characterized with denudational
loess ridge and gullies, developed flow erosion, deep valleys, and fractured surfaces
with elevation about 1000 m.
The river bed of the section from Toketo to Longkou is deep with a gradient of 1/800.
The landforrn is typical U-shaped valley landform with valley width of 300-500 m and
steep cliffs on the two banks 100-200 m above the river bed.
(c.3) Geology
The rock in both banks of the dam site is dolomite, limestone, shale, marl of lower
Ordovician and upper Cambrian, and the rock at the dam foundation is limestone,
shale, and marl of the mid-Cambrian. The basic earthquake intensity in the area is 6.
There is a distribution of Zhang-Xia Group formation under the dam foundation below
the river bed. The fourth and second layers are interbeds of limestone marl and shale.
(c.4) Soils/Erosion
The soils in the reservoir area are mainly infertile and loosen loess. Because of sparse
vegetation, concentrated severe storms in July-September and fractured surface, the
erosion in the area is serious with erosion area of over 40%. Surface erosion 1-2
cmiyear and valley erosion 15-17 cm/year.
(c.5) Surface Water Hvdrolov
(c.5.1) Hvdrological Stations
A hydrological station was established at Wanjiazhai in June 1954, but
abandoned in September 1961. The data of Hekouzhen Hydrological Station,
about 120 km upstream Wanjaizhai, were used for hydrological analysis of the
dam site. There are three comparatively large tributaries, Yangjiachuan, Honghe,
and Dahei rivers with catchment areas of 1,002, 5,533, and 17, 673 kM2,
respectively, between Hekouzhen and Wanjiazhai, and a tributary, Pianguan
River with a catchment area of 2,089 kmn, 10 km downstream from the dam site.
No hydrological station is located on the Yangjiachuan River. The stations are
listed below.

(c.5.2) Runoff at Dam Site
The runoff at the dam site is divided into two parts: flow from Hekouzhen and
flow from intermediate catchment between Hekouzhen and Wanjiazhai. The
latter amounts to very small portion, only about 2% of the total.
From data series of 35 years (1952-1986) of Hekouzhen, the observed average
annual runoff at Hekouzhen is 24.8 billion m3, with the maximum of 43.6 billion
m3 (year 1967) and the minimum of 1.24 billion m3 (year 1969). Most of the
runoff concentrates in July-October, being 58.5% of the annual total.
The runoff of Hekouzhen under natural condition (no influences of upstream
water uses upstream) was calculated and data series was extended to May 1919
by the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission. The results are applied in
the hydrological calculation in the preliminary design by TIDI. The average
annual runoff at Hekouzhen under natural condition is 32.5 billion m3 (july 1919-
June 1986), and the maximum is 54.2 billion m3 (hydrological year 1967-1968)
and minimum is 16.1 billion m3 (hydrological year 1928-1929).
The runoff from intermediate catchment between Hekouzhen and Wanjiazhai was
calculated according to the observed modulus of runoff in Fangniugou
hydrological station. The average discharge is 11.2m3/s (1955-1986), equivalent
to annual runoff of 0.35 billion m3.
(c.5.3) Desien Flood at Waniiazhai
Floods both from Hekouzhen and from the intermediate catchment between
Hekouzhen and Wanjiazhai result from rainfall. Pearson type III distribution

Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                    Final Report
(c.7)          Groundwater
The groundwater in the area may be divided into three types: alluvial pore water,
fissure water, and Karst water.
(c.7.1)     The alluvial pore water is mainly distributed in the flat area of
larnawan (upstream), Hekozhen Town and Hequ country (downstream).
Aquifers, mainly silt or silty gravel, are generally 2-3 m below the surface. In
addition to the water supply of rainfall, the Yellow River may also supply to
or be supplied by the groundwater.
(c.7.2)    The fissure water is mainly distributed in the area north of the
Honghekou and is supplied mainly by rainfall. The water drains to Yellow
River or Valleys in form of springs.
(c.7.3)    The Karst water is the main groundwater in the reservoir area
and is in the aquifers of Cambrian strata and Carbonate rock of Ordovician
system. The Karst water is usually deeply buried and is mainly supplied by
rainfall and drains to the Yellow River in the form of springs. The relatively
large spring groups in the area include the Xiaganghang and Liujiapan of the
left bank with discharge rates of 1.157 m3/s, 1.85 m3/s respectively and the
Yushuwan on the right bank with discharge rate of 0.062 m3/s.  The
groundwater level in the large area of the right bank is usually 10-90 m below
the normal water level in Wanjiazhai Reservoir, which is the main reason for
the reservoir infiltration on the right bank.
(c.8)    Groundwater Quality
The chemical water type of the Karst water, which is the dominant groundwater,
in the reservoir area and the groundwater in dam site area, is basically of the
same type as Yellow River water with low degree of mineralization with
bicarbornate alkalinity. This type of water is of good quality and may be used for
practically all purposes.
(d)  Natural Ecological Resources
(d. 1)   Forests and Vegetation
There is very little natural forest in ESA for Wanjiazhai Reservoir. S. Bungeana
was originally the typical local vegetation. Because of the wind erosion, its
development is restrained. Thymus mongolicus has developed and formed a
secondary commnunity in the area. Thymus mongolicus may fix aeolian silt around
it and form dune vegetation. In addition, Glycyrriza uralensis, stellera
chamejarme, and Ephedra egnisetina also from secondary vegetation. The crops
in the area are mainly millet and broom corn millet.
(d.2)   Terrestrial Wildlife
Only a few species of wildlife are found in the area. The dry-tolerant rats are
commonly seen. Lark and swan may be found in around springs.

Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                     Final Relort
Due to the high flow rate and silt contents, riverine aquatic habitats are
generally poor, and aquatic communities are relatively marginal. Only few algae
plants are found in the area.
Fish species and quantities are very limited. According to the investigation
conducted by Inner Mongolia Institute of Aquatic Production, the fish species in
the area include Grassosrp, Crucian, silvercarp, trout, cyprinidea, carp, etc.
Because of lack of fishery resources, there are no fishermen depending on
fishery.
(e)  Development
Wanjiazhai Reservoir is in a rural, less developed area. The development resources in
the area are discussed in Section 4.5, "Resettlement".
(f)  Quality of Life Resources
(f. 1)    Socio-Economics:
Wanjiazhai reservoir area is located in Pianguan Qingshui, and Zhunger counties.
All are poor counties, among the poorest in China. With poor industrial and
agricultural development, living standards are very low and the local economics
depends on state subsidies.
As a result of natural restraints, crops are mainly side and oil crops, with a unit
yield less than 1,500 kg/ha.
However, there are rich mineral resources here, mainly coal, carclazyte, and
limestone. These are not yet fully developed and utilized. At present, industry is
mainly dependent on small-size processing operations, for coal mining, ceramics,
and cement. These represent relatively low output values.
(f.2)    Public Health
Information obtained from Inner Mongolia and Shanxi Provincial Anti-epidemic
Station shows that the Wanjiazhai reservoir area is historically a plague and
brucelliasis-striken. Major endemic diseases are endemic goiter and fluorosis.
Communicable diseases are mainly bovillae, bronchocephalitis, scarlatina, flu,
encephalitis B, dysentery, hepatitis, and typhoid. Of these, flu has the highest
morbidity, and then dysentery and hepatitis. Over the past several decades the
local governments have made many efforts for improving public health, so that
plague has been essentially phased out, with brcucelliasis put under effective
control.
(f.3)    ArcheoloRical Relics
There are no significant archeological relics in the area.
(f 4)    Cultural Values
There are no known special cultural values in the area.
(f.5)    Recreation: The Wanjiazhai Reservoir is build in the mountainous rural
area, There are no significant recreation areas in the region.

Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project                                    Final Report
4.8.3.4 Impact Assessment
(a)  Natural Physical Resources
(a. 1)    Surface Water Ouantity
Wanjiazhai Reservoir will significantly increase the available surface water
quantity in the area and will supply 200 million m3 water to Junggar of Inner
Mongolia and 1,200 million m3 water to Shanxi Province annually.
(a.2)    Flooding Hazard
The reservoir has a flood storage capacity if 302 million m3. When a 10,000
year peak discharge of 21,000 m3/s is encountered, the reservoir may regulate the
peak discharge and reduce the flood to 8,221 m3/s with water level in the
reservoir not exceeding EL 980 m. This will bring relief from the flood threat to
the downstream area.
The dam is of concrete gravity type which is safe and reliable. The risk of
flooding hazard due to dam failure is virtually impossible.
(a.3)    Surface Water Quality
Construction of Wanjiazhai reservoir is not expected to result in any significant
adverse effects on downstream water quality.
(a.4)    Groundwater
The groundwater level in the left bank is higher than the normal reservoir water
level. The reservoir would have no impacts on the groundwater in the left bank.
The groundwater level in a large area of right bank is 10-90 m below the normal
reservoir water level. According to the preliminary design report prepared by
TIDI, an annual average infiltration discharge of 7.0 m3/s the reservoir to the
ground of the right bank is expected, which is relatively a small amount and will
have no effect on the reservoir benefits. The infiltrated water will not affect the
excavation of the Junggar coals mine because most of the coal layers are above
the normal reservoir water level and are much higher than the groundwater level
below the coal mine. By contrast, the infiltrated water will improve the water
supply to the mine for coal. production.
(a.5)    Erosion/Sedimentation
The elevation of farmland around the reservoir area is 986-1,000 m, which is
much higher than the maximum reservoir water level 980 m. The reservoir will
have no swamp and erosion impacts on the soil and farmland around the
reservoir.
The Yellow River is the most silt-laden river in the world. The design average
annual sediment load of Wanjiazhai is estimated by the Yellow River Water
Conservancy Commission to by 149 million t with design average silt content of
6.6 kg/m3 (Ref 125).

Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                    Final Renort
The main concern on Wanjiazhai Reservoir sedimentation is to control the
sedimentation not to extend into the upstream area which is a flat plain river
course. A detailed study was carried out by TDI (Ref 130) in which a total of
14 operational alternative models were calculated and compared with the
following parameters selected as reservoir desilting operational parameters:
Normal water level       El 980 m
Desilting period         August-September
Desilting discharge:     5,000 rm./s
The results indicate that with the above operational conditions, it is ensured that
the sedimentation will not extend into the upstream area and the electricity
generation of the power station will not be affected.
The downstream two waterpower stations at Longkou, and Tianqiao, have the
same desilting operation approaches and periods; therefore Wanjiazhai Reservoir
will have no impacts on the desilting in these two stations.
A hydrological and sedimentation monitoring station is planned to be set up at
the end upstream area. The sedimentation in the area will be continually
monitored. In case of any significant sedimentation in the area, the reservoir
desilting discharge will be increased to desilt the sedimentation out the reservoir.
(a.6)    Seismic/Structural Stabilitv
Wanjiazhai Reservoir is in a relatively stable structural area in which faults are
not developed and no serious earthquake is recorded.
Two strong earthquakes rated 8.5 and 7.0 were recorded in Haiyuan, Ningxia
(Province) in 1920 and Linggiu, Shanxi Province in 1926, which had an effect
intensity rating of 6.0 for the reservoir area. An earthquak-e rating of 6.1 was
recorded in Lingar County. Inner Mongolia in 1976 whch had an intensity rating
of 5.0 for the reservoir area.
According to the earthquake intensity classification in China, basic earthquake
intensity at the Wanjiazhai dam site is rated at 6.0 (See Figure 3.4.8-1) (Ref
148). The concrete gravity dam and other structures have been designed to stand
earthquakes with intensity rated 7 (Ref. 125).
A structural stability analysis has been made by TIDI and the main conclusions
are as follows:
(i) The dam is safe and reliable. Dam failure due to earthquake and flood
is virtually impossible.
(ii) The dam site has no developed faults and has no geological conditions
to induce earthquakes (Ref. 130).
(a.7)    Landslides
Wanjiazhai Reservoir is a gully type reservoir. The strata of reservoir banks are
mainly Carbonate rock of Cambrian and Ordovician systems with no large
4.8 - 8



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                    Final Repon
structural surface inclined to the river course. The two bank slopes are steep and
stable and will have no landslides endangering the project.
(a.8)   Ice Jams
The Yellow River course in Inner Mongolia is in the most northern part of the
river basin. In the area, the freezing period may be as long as 5 months. During
the time of winter freezing and spring thawing, ice may flow into Wanjiazhai
Reservoir.
A total amount of about 50 million m3 ice is estimated to flow to the reservoir in
the winter freezing period and about 60 million m3 in spring thawing period with
maximum ice thickness of 0.5 m, maximum ice surface of 3 m2, and maximum ice
discharge of 25 m 3/s (Ref. 125). The ice flow, if not controlled, may form ice
jams which may cause backwater and ice flood disasters.
The following measures have been planned to control the ice-run (Ref. 130):
(i) The reservoir water level is lowered to below El 975 m in the period of
winter freezing to have 5 m safety height for possible ice jams (recorded
highest backwater height caused by ice jam is 3.2 m).
(ii) The reservoir water level is lowered to El 970 m at the beginning of
spring thawing to accelerate the break and thawing of reservoir surface
ice. Thus the reservoir will have 240 million m3 storage capacity
(between El 970-El 980 m) and 10 m safety height for possible ice jams
(Recorded highest backwater height caused by ice jam is 5.5 m at the
end of Tiangiao Reservoir and 6-7m at upstream of Wuda Railway
Bridge).
The storage of the ice flow in Wanjiazhai Reservoir will improve the ice-rune
control situation at the Tianqiao Reservoir.
(b)  Natural Biological Resources
(b. 1)   Forests and Wildlife
As descussed in Section 4.8.3.3 (d.l), and 4.8.3.3 (d.2), there is very little natural
forest with mongolicus as dorminant and very few species of wildlife (commonly
rats) in the ESA for Wanjiazhai reservoir. No significant impacts on forests and
wildlife are expected due to the construction of the reservoir project.
(b.2)    Aquatic Ecology
Due to the high flow rate and high silt content, the aquatic plants and animals in
the area are very limited.
The reservoir project should have no significant adverse effects on aquatic
ecology in the area. The project will provide a large area of stored water which
favours grow.th and propagation of algae plants as well as fish species, including
carp. Hence, considerable improvement in aquatic ecologV is expected after the
reservoir is completed.

(c) Economic Development
The impacts of Wanjiazhai water project on economic development in the reservoir
area are discussed in Section 4.5 on Resettlement.
(d)  Quality of Life Resources
(d. 1)    Socio-Economics
Construction of Wanjiazhai reservoir is expected to have a major impact on
improving local socio-economics because of the major improvements it will bring
in transportation (water, road), availability of electric power, and flood control,
all of which will certainly favor local commercial and industrial development.
(d.2)   Public Health
Creation of Wanjiazhai reservoir will pose significant hazards for increases in
some communicable disease which are water oriented including (i) malaria and
encephilitis, which are transmitted by mosquitoes, and (ii) haemonaghic fever,
which is transmitted by rats. The situation for Wanjiazhai will be very similar to
that for the Xiaolangdi dam/reservoir project now under construction, farther
down on the Yellow River main stem. Accordingly a number of EPMs are to be
implemented by the EMO to be established by MWR's Wanjiazhai Reservoir
Management. These include the following:
(i) Haemonaghic Fever:  Continuing observation of disease rates in
construction camp areas and in homes/buildings around reservoir during
construction stage with rat control measures implemented as needed.
(ii) Mosguito-Bome Diseases: (a) Insecticide spraying of construction
camp buildings, and (b) continuing observation of incidence of these
diseases, with control measures implemented where indicated, during
both construction and operations stages.
(iii) Sanitation Related Diseases: Fumishing of safe water supply and
adequate sanitation facilities for construction camps and for all
resettlement housing.
(d.3)   Cultural Values
There are no known special cultural values in the area which would be affected
by the project.
(d.4)    Archeological Values
There is no significant archeological relics in the area.
(e)  Construction Stage Constraints

Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                   Final Report
(f)  Reservoir Clearing
The laws of China require that new reservoir areas must be cleared to prevent
subsequent contamination of the reservoir water when it is filled. A total clearing cost
of 0.505 rmillion Yuan (Ref 148) is predicted and included in project budget. The
reservoir clearing includes the following aspects:
(f. )    Houses, buildings, structures and secondary buildings below normal
water level should be dismantled completely. Recoveries and floating materials
should be removed out of reservoir.
(f.2)    Underground structuies including wells, cellars, mine pits, shafts should
be filled or sealed with gravel and concrete to prevent seepage.
(f 3)    All toilets, folds, rubbish, wastes should be cleared and removed, and
the ground 0.5 m below their leveling layer should be excavated and removed.
Then the area should be sterilized by lime spreading with an amount of 0.5 kg/mt.
(f.4)    The tombs buried in past 15 years should be removed by their owners.
Each tomb should be sterilized with 0.5 kg bleaching powder.
(f.5)    All the trees in the reservoir area should be cut from the ground surface
and removed.
(g) Environment Monitoring
A detailed environmental monitoring program has been developed by TII (Ref 147)
which includes water quality, silt, ice, air, wastes, etc. This describes monitoring
stations, parameters, frequencies, facilities, and costs.
(h) Environment Managzement Plan
A special environment management agency (EMO) is proposed and planned to
implement and supervise the EPMs during both construction and operation stages. A
total of 1.497 million yuan is estimated for environment management as listed in Table
4.8.3.4-1
4.8.3.5 Summary and Conclusions
As shown by Figure 4.8.3-3, the Wanjiazhai project studies indicate that the project
should not cause any significant problems of environmental degradation, provided it is
designed and operated as planned, including incorporation of the EPMs specified in
the EIA and including provisions for resettlement.
A potential significant adverse effect on WWTP is the silt content of the diverted water
(about 3.5%) in possibly causing siltation/flooding problems in the Fen river system,
but the WVWNTP project plan incorporates adequate controls (see Section 4.9). The
project will result in large-scale positive benefits including flood control and power
production and availability of water for export to the WWTP target areas.

Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                 Final ReDort
Export of Wanjiazhai water for WWTP will have some effects in decrease total water
availability in the Lower Yellow River Basin, but these effects are minor and the export
allowance is provided for in the overall governmental plan for allocation of the Yellow
River water resource (see Section 4.12).
4.8.4 Fen-I Reservoir
4.8.4.1   Introduction
The existing Fen-l reservoir was completed in 1961 mainly for flood control, water
supply, power generation. Under the Phase I program it will have an additional
function, namely to provide regulation of the imported water. Wanjiazhai reservoir will
not provide water supply in the August-September sediment flushing period, and in
this period Fen-I reservoir will take its place to provide 57 million m3 water for
Taiyuan. During the remaining months of the year, the reservoir inflow will be the
upper Fen River flow plus some I million m3 Yellow River water per day. The daily
inflow volume will be increased by I million m3 while this amount is to be discharged
every day through the intake tower to be built. The existing power station will be also
expanded. When Phase I is completed, Fen-l reservoir will provide more water and
power, but its flood control function will not be adversely affected.
As noted in Section 4.8.2.2, Figure 4.8.2-2 shows the information available from
previous reports relating to preparation of the Fen-l reservoir EIA. Additional was
obtained by the EIA teamn to fill gaps.
4.8.4.2   Proiect DescwDtion
4.8.4.2.1   Existing Reservoir
(a)   Project Location
The project location is shown in Figure 4.8.4-1
(b)  Project Components
Figure 4.8.4-2 shows the project components.
The present project components include a dam, spillway, discharge tunnels,
power house, and flood/sediment tunnels. Involving a total quantity of
works of 6.36 million m3. The project costs a total of 64.5 million yuan,
inundating a total land area of 23,400 mu, with 10,501 people resettled.

m, total storage capacity of 700 million m3, and corresponding water level
of 1,129.2 m. In 1978, the dam was consolidated and raised to a height of
61.4 m, providing a total storage capacity of 700 million m3  and
4.8 - 12

The power station is an after-dam seasonal station located at the cone-type
mouth in the right floodland. It was completed and put into commission in
November 1986, with a total installed capacity of 13 MW (2 x 6.5 MW).
The design discharge for power generation is 29.5 m3/s.
(b.5) Flood/Sediment Tunnel
This tunnel (48.0 m) is located on the right side of the spillway, having a
total length of 1,231 m. The design maximum discharge is 785 m3/s. The
inlet bottom is at El 1,086.7 m and the outlet at El 1,072.5 m a 7 x 8.668 m
steel radial gate is installed.
(c) Operation Mode
(c. I) Flood Control
As originally planned, the design flood control standard was the 100-year
flood, with 1,000-year check flood. Subsequent expansion and
consolidation have increased the design standard to the 300-year flood,
with the check flood remaining unchanged, as required by the ever-
increasing flood flow, sedimentation, and dam aging, with the flood-season
limiting water level lowered from 1,126 m to 1,122 m.
(c.2) Water Supply
Due to the inflowv deficit and the increasing downstream water demand over
the past 3 decades, the reservoir has been operating in the mode of "storing
clear water and discharging muddy water" under the condition of ensured
4.8- 13



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Project                                  Final Revort
flood control safety. A total amount of 8.833 billion m3 water has been
supplied for the downstream areas, amounting to 316 million mi3/year.
(c.3) Operation
The recorded maximum water level is at 1,126.64 m (March 6, 1979),
representing a storage capacity of 363.7 million m;. The maximum yearly
quantity of retained water is 493 million m3 (1967), whereas the minimum
is 76.6 million m3 (1987). The maximum and minimum  yearly inflow
volumes are respectively 1,250 million m3 (1967) and 136 million m 3
(1987). The maximum yearly sedimentation volumes are respectively 49.9
million m3 (1967) and 940,000 m3 (1987), with maximum sediment inflow
of 60.7 million m3 (1967) and minimum of ,1.646 million m3 (1987). By the
end of 1989, a total amount of 330.11 million mi3 sediment had deposited in
the reservoir, taking up 45.66% of the total storage capacity, with 48.1
million m3 remaining effective capacity. The actual net capacity is now less
than 390 million m3. In front of the dam, siltation has raised the ground
level to 1,103 m, which is 13.6 m higher than the bottom of the discharge
tunnel outlet.
(d)  Instrumentation and Forecasting
Instrumentation of the overall project includes 142 items, for measurement
of deformation, stress, seepage, flow pattern, etc. Reservoir observation
items are 7, including sedimentation, water quality, and water level.
Observation of the catchment area involves 10 subjects, such as
precipitation, flow volume, and sediment content. Reservoir forecasting
covers also 10 items, including flood control and irrigation.
(e) Benefits
The reservoir has produced huge benefits in flood control, water supply,
power generation and diversified economy. Since its establishment, the dam
has successfully operated through 6 major floods with a peak flow larger
than 1,500 m3/s, and 5 floods with 5-day flood flow over I million m3, thus
effectively ensuring the safety of populations and properties in Taiyuan and
downstream areas. The total flood control benefit totals 2,242 million yuan.
Over the past 30 years, the total inflow was 10.775 billion m3, of which
9.998 billion m3 was discharged (including 841 million m3 lost to the sea).
In the extremely dry year of 1986, the total inflow was 143 million m3, but
the reservoir provided the downstream areas with a total amount of 269
million m3, i.e. 185% of the inflow. Full use of the reservoir regulations has
played an important part in the local industrial and agricultural
development. Since 1986, the power station has generated hundreds of
millions of k-wh power. The dam has retained approximately 400 million mi3
sediment, which contributes to relaxing sedimentation risks on Sanmenxia
reservoir and lower reaches of the Yellow River. In addition, tens of
thousands of kg fresh fish has been provided.

4 8.4.2.2 Modification to Fen-I Reservori for WWTPlPhase I
Fen-I reservoir will provide water regulation during Phase I WWTP. In order to meet
this requirement, an intake structure will be built close to the dam. In addition, the
existing power station will be expanded to have a larger installed capacity, which will
mak-e better use of the water resources
(a)  Intake Structure
(a. 1) General Layout
The intake structure is located between the existing intake towers to the
04 and 08 m tunnels, with a ground level of 1,1 18 m and bedrock surface
level of 1,1 10 m. The tower is arranged 29 m above the rock surface. The
design flow is 20.5 m3/s. Behind the gate is a press tunnel with an inner
diameter of 2.5 m. The rear part of the tunnel passes through the rock mass
below the spillway baseplate and that above the smaller tunnel, with the
outlet governed by an electric valve. The tunnel is 446.8 m long, connecting
to the 02.5 m power penstock.
The layout for the intake structure is shown in Figure 4.8.4-3, whereas the
main parameters is shown in Table 4.8.4-1.
(a.2) Arrangement of Intake Structure
    Intake Tower
The intake tower is of a semi-shaft and semi-tower type, with a tower
height of 29 m and shaft depth of 10 m. As required by the layered flow
velocity, the inlet is divided into three orifices, each having a width of 4 m
and height of 21 m. The bottom of the tower is set at El 1,110 m in line
with the topography and geology at the tower site, and also the reservoir
operating level. The lowest operating level is at 1,114 m. The service
platform is set at El 1,13 1.5 m, and the hoist chamber roof at El 1, 139 m.
In front of the tower are 2 trashracks which will alternately stand by in
debris removal and maintenance operations. In the tower, there is a stoplog
slot, with the minimum water depth at the top limited at 3 m. The shaft is
provided with a service plate gate slot The gate size is 4 x 4 m, with gate
opening dimensions of 3.5 x 3.5 m. The service platform and the hoist
chamber are located above the intake tower. The hoist chamber is equipped
with trashrack, stoplog and gate hoists

Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                  Final Rewort
*    Discharge Tunnel (or I# Tunnel)
This is a press tunnel, having an inner diameter of 2.5 m, design flow of
20.5 m3/s, length of 446.8 m, inlet elevation of 1,100 m, and outlet
elevation of 1,068.6 m. With surrounding rocks of granite gneiss, the tunnel
is lined with 40 cm thick reinforced concrete.
*    Power Station
At the outlet of I # tunnel, a new generating unit with an installed capacity
of 10 MW is provided to expand the existing power station of Fen-1
reservoir.
*    Bypass Pipeline
To ensure that water supply for Taiyuan will not be interrupted as a result
of emergency maintenance of the Fen- I power station, a bypass penstock is
provided on the left side of the power station, with an inner diameter of 2.5
m and length of 259 m. For the purpose of energy dissipation, a 4-stage
orifice energy dissipater is provided along the penstock.  As roughly
calculated, this dissipater may curtail the head by 19.4 m when the reservoir
level is at 1,129 m, with the remaining head relieved in the downstream
plunge pool.
The plunge pool includes two parts, one is a sloping diffuser, and the other
is a rectangular flap-bottom trough, with a total length of 38 m. The former
part is 12 m long and 2.5-5.4 m wide, whereas the latter part is 26 m long
and 5.4 m wide. At the end of the pool is a buffer sill with a height of 2.1 m
and length of 5 m. Water flows from the buffer sill into the head of the
press forebay to the discharge pipe.
*    Press Forebay at the Head of Discharge Pipe
This forebay respectively links the tailrace channel of the power station and
the plunge pool of the bypass penstock. It comprises a diffusion, a
rectangular, and a contraction component, with a total length of 46 m. The
first component is 12 m long, with a bottom slope of 1:6, and width of 17.4
to 36.6 m; the second is 10.8 m long and 36.6 m wide; and the last is 16 m
long, with a width ranging from 36.6 m to 10.8 m.
On the right side of the forebay, there is a sluice gate and an overflow weir.
The bay has a built-in trashrack which includes 8 dividers, each of which
has net width of 3.5 m, pier height of 5.9 m, and water depth 4.4 m. And
each is provided with 3.9 x 4.7 (width x height) front and rear grids for
altemate use, with a mesh size of IO x 10 mm, and twine diameter of I mm.
The through-gird head loss is 0.2 m. Debris removing and hoisting facilities
are installed above the trashrack. A plat service gate is furnished at the
terminal of the press forebay, i.e. the intakle to the discharge pipe. The
4.8- 16



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final Report
design minimum water level of the forebay is at El 1,072 m, with bottom
level at El 1,067.6 m, and water depth of 4.4 m.
(b) Power Station
A 10 MW,r new generating unit will be provided to enlarge the installed
capacity of the existing power station. Assuming a yearly utilization of
7,026 hours, design head of S l m, and design discharge of 20.5 m3, this
new unit will generate 70.26 GWH power each year. The new unit will be
located on the left side of the existing power house, in parallel to the old
unit. The old and new units will be of coaxiality, equidistance, and equal
installation elevation (1,069.6 m). The assembly bay should be extended to
the left side. The new and old tailbays will be separated with a dividing
wall, and connected with a gate, which will provide stand-by water supply
in the event of emergency maintenance of the generating units. Culverts will
be used, downstream of the tailbays, to deliver water to the press forebay
of the discharge pipe. In the expansion process, the existing 12 m long
assembly bay and the upstream auxiliary power house will be removed
until the foundation. A new power house with a length of 24 m (including
assembly bay) and an auxiliary power house (still comprising 3 floors) will
be constructed at the same levels, namely, generating unit floor at El
1,07634 m, turbine floor at El 1,071.64 m, and tailrace floor at El 1,06593
m. The structures of both new and old power houses are similar, with a
brick-concrete part above the generating unit floor, and reinforced concrete
part below, with the 02.5 m bypass penstock (at central elevation of
1,660.65 m) passing beneath the assembly bay. In the event of any
emergency stoppage in the power house, the bypass pipe will deliver water
to the intake tower, by skipping the power house, so as to ensure normal
water supply for Taiyuan.
4.8.4.3   Environmental Settinz
(a) Catchment Area
Fen-l reservoir is located in the upper Fen River basin, 122 km downstream of
the river source (Leiming Temple spring, Ningwu County) and 98 km upstream
of Taiyuan. The catchment area above the reservoir is 5,268 kM2, respectively
governed by Ningwu, Jingle, Lanxian, and Loufan Counties. This area has a
river density of 0.35 km/kim2, gully density of 5-8 km/kM2, long-term erosion
modulus of 5,000 tons/km2, runoff modulus of 79,200 M3/km2, and silt
2~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
discharge modulus of 87.3 tons/km2. The maximum reservoir area is 32 kmi,
with back-water reaching upstream  a maximum distance of 18.3 km. The
catchment area above the reservoir is illustrated in Figure 3.4.9-3.
(b) Climate/Hydrology/Sedimentation
The catchment area above Fen-1 reservoir is of a temperate continental climate,
dry and wvindy, especially in the spring, with a long-term yearly mean
precipitation of 469.6 mm, 48% of vhich is generally concentrated in the July-

August period. The long-term average evaporation is 1,779 mm. The recorded
maximum and the minimum temperatures are respectively 36.4°C and -30.5°C,
and the maximum wind velocity is 25 m/s. The design average inflow is 452
million m3, but in fact 368 million m3, 60% of which occurs in the flood season.
The monthly mean flow volumes in the 29-year series from 1961 to 1989 are
given in Table 4.8.4-2. Table 4.8.4-3 describes the water levels in the 30-year
series from 1960 to 1989. The freezing period lasts 70 to 100 days, with an ice
thickness of 40-80 cm The long-term annual average sediment inflow is 21
million tons, 96% of which comes in the wet season. The maximum average of
sectional sediment content is 605.5 kg/m3 in Fen River (at Jingle hydrometric
station, July 19, 1951) and 840 kg/m3 in Lanhe River (at Sharigjingyou
hydrometric station, June 18, 1963). Details on sedimentation are given in
Table 4.8.4-4
(c) Geology, Hydrogeology, and Ecology
General descriptions of the ESA for Fen-l reservoir are discussed in
Section 3.4 of Chapter 3.
(d)  Fen-l Reservoir Water Quality
For the purpose of regular monitoring, Taiyuan Environmental Monitoring
Station has arranged 4 monitoring sites in the reservoir area, namely, 1,,
site immnediately close to the darn, 4# at the upstream end, 3# at the Jian
River mouth, and 2# at the reservoir center (see Figure 4.8.4-4).
Monitoring items include pH, total hardness, COD, BOD, oil, and others,
all together 20 items.
This EIA has utilized the monitoring data of June-August 1993 provided by
the Station. Also, two sample monitorings were conducted in April 1996.
The monitoring and evaluation results are respectively described in Table
4.8.4-5 and Table 4.8.4-6.
(e) Socio-Economics
General description of the socio-economic setting is given in Section 3.6
and 3.7 of Chapter 3.
Fen-l reservori is located within Loufan County, which has a total
population of 84,000 people distributed in a total land area of 1,290 km 2
govemed by 12 townships, with a population density of 65.8 persons/km2.
The county economy is based on agriculture, with a total farmland area of
44,600 ha. Grain crops are sweet potato, naked oats, bean, prosomillet and
others, while cash crops include sun flower, rape, and flax.
Dahurian larch predominates above El 1,300 m, while ulmus pumila,
Robinia pseudoacacia and Ailanthus altissima predominate in hilly land
areas. In gullies, poplar is the predominant species. Chestnut and other fruit

trees are found in the vicinity of settlements. In this region, poultry and
animal husbandry is supported by sericulture and apiculture.
There are rich mineral sources here, including iron, coal, construction
materials and rare metals.
The local industry is undeveloped, without any large industrial enterprise
except Jiantieshan Iron Mine. There are only some small coal mines, iron
works and construction materials producers.
The county seat and larger villages are located in the Jian River valley with
a width of some 200 to 500 m, stretching from southwest to northeast. All
the 5 villages involved in Dujiaoqu Township are poor areas, with only 3
factories, producing an annual gross output value of 191,000 yuan. The
economy is agriculturally characterized, with a total cropped area of 456
ha. Because of the poor farming facilities and the less fertile land, the gross
output value of agriculture is only 682,000 yuan.
4.8.4.4    Environmental Impact Assessment
(a) Hydrology
According to the statistical data of the 29-year series from 1961 to 1989,
the annual average inflow of the Fen River is 11.834 m3/s (See Table 4.8.4-
2). Excluding August and September, the average volume of the remaining
10 months is 8.24 m3/s. When the imported water is available upon the
completion of Phase I WWTP, the inflow volume will be increased by
approximately 11.7 m3/s (1.4 times more) except for August and
September. The monthly average flow will be increased up to 4 times. The
imported inflow will not stay in Fen-l reservoir, thus not using the effective
storage capacity. In fact, it will flow, through the reservoir, to the intakle
structure. However, the water flow will be increased so much as to cause
changes to the reservoir regime, thus resulting in a higher flow velocity and
a larger water surface area. Such changes, however, will be almost within
those before water importation. Mloreover, the monthly flow will fluctuate
to a lesser extent, thus keeping the reservoir hydrology relatively stable. No
significant adverse impacts on hydrology will be posed on Fen-l reservoir.
(b) Sediment
The annual inflow of Fen-1 reservoir will be increased by 350 million m3
water imported from the Yellow River. With a sediment content of 1.3
kg/rnm, this amount of imnported water will carry 455,000 tons of sediment
to the reservoir each year, representing only 4% of the long-term sediment
inflow before water importation (see Table 4.8.3.2-6). Generally, this part
of sediment accompanying the imported water will be only a small portion
of the reservoir sediment inflow, so the reservoir sedimentation will not be
significantly affected.
4.8- 19



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                     Final Report
(c) Water Quality
The water quality of Fen-l reservoir outflow is predicted as discussed in
Section 5.5 of Chapter 5.
(d) Ecology
Fen-I is an old reservoir having operated for more than 30 years. A well
established ecology has been formed in the reservoir area. Phase I WWTP
includes the construction of an intake structure in front of the dam and
expansion of the existing power station, with a limited size of works.
Although the terrestrial fauna and flora in the vicinity will be somewhat
disturbed or destroyed, such impacts will be limited and will only be
encountered in the construction stage. No impacts are expected to be
caused to the aquatic ecology in the construction stage. During the
operation stage, the imported water will bring some exotic aquatic species
to the reservoir, resulting in a shift in the reservoir eco-balance, but this
should have no significant impact on the overall areal aquatic ecology.
(e) Flood Control
As shown in Table 4.8.4-3, the maximum  and the minimum  average
monthly water levels of Fen-I reservoir are respectively 1,110.25 m (in
July) and 1,116.89 m (in December), with NPL at 1,129 m. The bottom of
the intake tower is at El 1, I 10 m, with a minimum operating level of 1, 114
m (see Figure 4.8.4-3). The water surface of the intake tower is designed to
be within the current reservoir operation level, thus the reservoir level will
not be raised because of water .taking requirements. The water supply
regulating function will not affect the existing flood control functions of
the reservoir.
4.8.4.5    Summary and Conclusions
The construction stage for altering Fen-l reservoir is not expected to result in any
significant adverse effects on the existing environmental resources in the vicinity.
Use of Fen-l reservoir for WWTP regulation, following construction, will bring about
minor changes in reservoir hydrology, but without adverse effects, and the existing
flood protection function of the reservoir should not be impaired. The sediment load
into the reservoir will be small compared to that from local runoff, hence no adverse
effects are expected. The imported water inflow will.. result in some shift in the
reservoir aquatic ecology balance, but this should not result in any adverse effects on
the reservoir fishery nor on the regibnal aquatic ecology.

SECTION 4.9
EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION
4.9.1 Introduction
The background information on erosion and sedimentation in the ESA is given in
Section 3.4 4.
The purpose of Section 4.9 is to check that WWTP design engineers have duly
considered the issues of erosion and sedimentation.
The following assessments are based on references 101, 102, 108, 109, 120, 126, 130,
136, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151 and 152.
The GML and SML pass through the area with gullies and eroded loess plateau. The
fragmented topography, poor vegetation coverage, and heavy seasonal rainfall result in
the severe soil erosion in this area, being one of the severest erosion areas in the middle
Yellow River basin.
Most of the Connection Works are to be built along the Fen River course which is the
loess plateau zone with severe soil erosion.
4.9.2 Construction Impacts on Soil Erosion
4.9.2.1 Tunnels and Aqueducts
The GML, SMIL and Connection Works go through the area by means of tunnels and,
aqueducts, which will not significantly alter the land vegetation. Therefore, GML,
SML and Connection Works constructions should not result in significant soil erosion
problems.
4.9.2.2 Buried Pipes
Buried pipes are used in some of the SML and Connection Works. During
construction, a channel will firstly be dug out. The excavated rock and earth will be
temporarily stocked in the area along the channel, which may cause dispersion of the
waste earth during rains. As discussed in Section 4.11, dikes and other measures must
be provided by CC to prevent dispersion.
4.9.2.3 Tunnel Disposals
Disposal of the tunnel excavation materials is discussed in Section 4 11 Dikes and
other measures are designed and planned to be built or taken for the disposal to
prevent erosion prior to permanent disposal. The EMO should check and ensure these
measures are followed by CCs during tunnel excavation
4.9.2.4 Denuded Areas

Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                 Final Report
Construction of all WWTP components including aqueducts, roads, etc. will involve
cut-fill resulting in denuding of surface vegetation and placing of fill material in fill
areas. To avoid runoff of silt during rains, the CCs are required to built temporary
dikes during construction and later revegetate and resurface the denuded areas (Refer
to Section 4.11).
4.9.3 Erosion in Reservoir Watersheds
This subject is discussed in the reservoir EIAs included in Section 4.8.
4.9.4 Sedimentation
4.9.4.1 Silt Content in Diverted Water
The Yellow River has the largest silt content of major rivers in the world. Observed
maximum silt content at Wanjiazhai is 37.6 kg/m3 and the average design silt content
is 6.6 kgmn3.
The operation method of "Store the clear water and release the turbid" is to be
adopted in Wanjiazhai Reservoir after its completion. The "store period" starts on Oct.
I each year and ends on July 31 next year and the "release period" starts on August I
and ends on Sept. 30 each year.
The WWTP will divert water from Wanjiazhai Reservoir only in the "store period"
during which the water is much clearer with less silt content due to the function of the
reservoir. According to the results of a study conducted by TIDI in 1992, the diverted
water has an average silt content of 1.3 kg/m3 (Ref 148, 149). Table 4.9.4 - I shows
the monthly average silt content of diverted water.
In WWTP Phase I, 350 million m3 water from year 2001 and 640 million m3 water
from year 2004 will be diverted annually along the GML, SML, Fen River course to
Fen-I Reservoir and then along the Connection Works to Taiyuan Service area.
Therefore, a total amount of 0.35 million m3 silt from year 2001 and 0.64 million m3
from year 2004 will be diverted with the water annually from Wanjiazhai Reservoir to
the Fen River course, and then to Fen- I Reservoir.
The impacts of the project on sedimentation along the transmission lines are discussed
below.
4.9.4.2 Sedimentation along Fen River Course
The Fen River is also a very silty riiver with an average silt content of 39.4 kg/m3 and
an average annual runoff of 368 million m3.
The annual volume of water diverted from Wanjiazhai reservoir (350 million m3 at
2001 increasing to 640 million m3 by 2004) will be about the same in 2001 as the
average flow in the Fen River, 368 million m3/y. However, the silt content in the
Yellow River water will be only about 3.3% (1.3 kg/39.4 kg) of the silt content in the
4.9 - 2

Fen River. Therefore, the effect of the Yellow River silt on the existing Fen River silt
content will be to decrease the sediment concentration in the Fen River Hence the
Yellow River inflow will drecrease, not increase, siltation problems in the river.
4.9.4.3 Sedimentation in Fen-I Reservoir
Fen- I Reservoir was completed in 1961 and Fen-2 Reservoir (which is not included in
WWTP and now is under construction) is to be completed in 1998. In phase I, the two
reservoirs are planned to be operated cooperatively to deal with the sedimentation in
Fen-l Reservoir. Table 4.9.4-2 shows the calculated results for desilting in the two
reservoirs (with the assumption that future Haoshuigou Reservoir will be put into
operation in year 2005). It is seen from Table 4.9.4-2 that the diverted silt represents a
small part of the total silt in Fen-l Reservoir basin, 2.8 percent, and therefore its
impacts on sedimentation in Fen-I Reservoir is considered negligible.
4.9.4.4 Sedimentation in Huyan Water Treatment Plant
As noted in Chapter 2 and Section 4.13 and as shown in Fig. 1.1.3 -1, the Connection
Works, which comprise mainly tunnels and pipes, will divert the upper layer water in
Fen-I Reservoir directly to the Huyan Water Treatment Plant. Because the diverted
water will stay in the Fen-l Reservoir for an average period of 5 month, the upper
layer water in Fen-I Reservoir has negligible silt content. No significant sedimentation
is expected in the Connection Works as well as in the water treatment plant. However,
the planned Huyan Water Treatment Plant will include a preliminary setting tank which
will manage any silt in the incoming flow.
4.9.5 Summary and Conclusions
Assuming that the contracts for the CCs include provisions as noted in Section 4.9.2,
and assuming proper use of environmental construction inspectors (Chapter 9),
construction of WWTP should not cause any significant erosion problems The EMO
should continually check the construction operations through environment
construction inspectors, and ensure that all erosion prevention measures are followed
by CCs during the project construction.
The sedimentation due to the silt content in the diverted water has been duly
considered by the design engineers and arrangements for effectively managing this silt
have been included in project design and plan. Because the diverted silt represents only
a small amount of the total silt reaching the Fen River course and Fen-l Reservoir,
around 3 percent, no significant impacts are expected on sedimentation in the areas
along SML.

QUALITn  OF LIFT
4.10 QUALITY OF LIFE
4.10.1 Introduction
As noted in Section 3.7 of Chapter 3, Shanxi province, including the ESA, is amongst
the poorest in China in terms of per capita income, and in terms of practically all other
indicators of quality of life including facilities for domestic water supply, health clinics,
schools, etc. which depend upon per capita income levels. Moreover, the situation is
much worse in the rural agnrcultural villages than in urban/industrial zones. The single
most important problem which impedes better development, and which even threatens
maintenance of the existing industry and jobs, is lack of water, and WWTP's essential
purpose is to furnish additional water to alleviate the shortage in the urban/industrial
target zones.
The purpose of Section 4.10 is to assess the impact of WWTP on the existing quality
of life in the EIA.
4.10.2 People Affected by WWTP Transmission System
Table 4.10-1, compiled from 1995 data assembled by a World Bank Mission (Ref
139), indicates the magnitudes of losses for various quality of life resources for the
WWTP delivery system.
The Mission report stipulates policies to be applied to WWTP as follows:
(a) The final RS(Resettlement) plan should include a recheck and updating of
all of the affected population and physical losses.
(b) The final RS plan should include a detailed household analysis.
(c) The land and house compensation standards formulated in 1992 by the
Provincial Government for YRDP should be updated to current values, and
used as the basis for estimating RS costs.
(d) Special attention should be given in the detailed RS planning and
implementation to guarantee the improvement of vulnerable groups, namely
women and oldsters.
The detailed RS planning completed in July 1994 incorporates all of these provisions,
including safety net provisions and other provisions as noted in Section 4.5 on
"Environmental Review of Resettlement". Hence the quality of life of all resettler
families should certainly be no less than-without the project and in most cases should
be significantly improved, including better housing and, for those who will be able to
shift to industrial employment, considerably greater incomes. In addition, the new RS
villages will all have a minimum level of infrastructure to meet acceptable minimum
quality of life needs, including water supply, clinics, and schools. The Environmental
Monitoring Program specified in Chapter 7 includes provisions for periodic checking
4.10 -1



Waniiazhai Water Transfer proiect                                 Final Report
of the actual performance of the RS plan, which will serve to check the monitoring
data from the RS monitoring program.
4.10.3 Taiyuan Service area
4.10.3.1     Per Capita Income Increase
Water supply for industrial and agricultural use will be greatly improved when the
imported water is available to Taiyuan. The per capita gross output values in different
target years, including both industrial and agricultural values, are expected to be
increased as shown as follows:
Target Year                2001            2010           2020
Total Population                240.8           268.6           296.7
Gross Output Value (I 04 uan)   319.56          520.11          969.89
Per Capita(104 yuan)             1.327          1.936           2.595
Based on the projected growth, it is expected that the incomes will be significantly
increased.
4.10.3.2     Per Capita Water Use
With the imported water available to Taiyuan, the per capita water quota is predicted
to be 200 I/d in 2001, 230 lId in 2010, and 250 U/d in 2020. This will completely alter
the water use situation and will be crucial to quality of life improvement. More than
70% of families will have their own bath rooms and people will be able to bathe twice
a week on the average.
4.10.3.3     Urban Greenin2 and Recreation
The imported water will resolve the problem of inadequate water supply for urban
greening and recreational purposes. As presented by the municipal construction
planning agency, Dongshan and Xishan scenic spots will be-linked with various parks
and gardens by 2001 to provide a beautiful landscape, by mak-ing full use of Fen River
and 8 tributaries. Also, it is planned to utilize an inflatable dam to dam off Fen River,
providing a strip park on water. On the each bank of the river, a series of scenic spots
will be formed, such as Yinmahe, Xihaizi, and Nanhaizi. At that time, the afforestation
coverage rate in the urban area will reach 37.12%, with 5.4 m2 greenland per capita.
Also, approximately 20 small parks and gardens will be provided.
4.10.3.4     Other Environmental Oualitv Indices
When additional water supply is available, the greenland area in the city proper and in
the vicinity will be enlarged to a great extent, subsequently improving the local air,
water, and acoustic environmental quality. This will represent a solid base for making

Waniiazhai Water Transfer proiect                                    Final Report
Taiyuan a modern industrial city with pleasing landscape and fresh air. The local
environment will be steadily improved to be more and more favorable.
4.10.4 Other Qualitv of Life Issues
Most quality of life issues relate closely to family income levels, as discussed above.
The exceptions include provisions for protection of precious historical monuments and
relics in the ESA which would be subject to being damaged by WWTP. This is not
believed to be a problem for WVWTP, but in any case the Environmental Management
Office (Chapter 9) will have responsibility for identifying any inadequacies in the
overall quality of life program and for recommending and pursuing needed correction
measures.

SECTION 4.11
CONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS CONSTRAIUNTS
4.11.1    Introduction
The purpose of Section 4.11 is to describe the EPMs (Environmental Protection
Measures) which must be carried out to ensure that the operations of the Construction
Contractor (CC) will include: (i) due attention to preventing unnecessary adverse-
effects on environment which can be avoided by proper use of these EPMs, and (ii) use
of offsetting measures to overcome any unavoidable significant adverse effects.
The necessary EPMs applicable to construction stage include the following:
(a)   Compilation of contracts to be observed by the CC during construction stage.
(b)  Incorporation into the CC's contract of the various construction stage EPMs so
that the CC is aware of these requirements and will allow budgets for these in
his contract proposal.
(c)  Provision of an Environmental Construction Inspector (ECI) who will work
together with the Engineering Supervisor of Construction, who will routinely
observe the CC's work to ensure that the CC is observing the specified EPMs.
Items (a), (b), (c) are to be carried out by the Environmental Management Office
described in Chapter 9.
4.11.2    Constraints for Construction Contractor
Figure 4.11.2-1 is a summary of the general constraints to be observed by the CC.
This should be elaborated upon by the YRDP engineering staff who are familiar with
construction operations in the ESA.
As noted above, the EMO (to be established pursuant to WB Load Agreement) is to
work with the Project Civil Engineers responsible for preparing the CC's contract, so
that all needed EPMs will be included in the Contract. A useful reference example for
this purpose is that CC's contract for the Xiaolangdi project (Ref 206.1).
4.11.3    Environmental Construction Inspector (ECI)
The experiences at Xiaolangdi and elsewhere have shown that, even if the CC's
contract does include the needed EPMs, the CC can be expected to comply with these
only if continuing inspection of his work his made by the ECI (one or more for each
project component as needed).   The experience at Xiaolangdi (now  under
construction) has shown that his supervision is especially important for ensuring: (i)
adequate control of dust, (ii) safety water supply for construction works and for
resettler villages, (iii) adequate excreta management for resettlement villages.

Waniiazhai Water Transfcr Proiect                                  Final Report
Like the Engineering Supervisor of Construction the ECI is to keep a daily log book
and make weekly reports to the EMO, and any additional reports which may be needed
in event of emergency to report any non-compliance so that the EMO can take
appropriate correction measures.
One of the products of the Xiaolangdi work is a manual on the environmental laws of
China to be observed during construction/implementation stage by individuals involved
in the project. This should be put into use by the EMO for the WWTP (Ref. 206.2).
4.11.4       Disposal of Tunnel Excavation Materials
4.11.4.1     Basic Principles of Disposal
A special problem for WWTP is disposal of the large amount of materials excavated
from boring of the tunnels. Concems deserving attention include farmland occupation,
river course blockage, soil and water loss, vegetation destruction, and landscape
problems. Figure 4.11.4-1 is a listing of general environmental constraints to be
observed. Additional constraints are the followings:
(a)    Such disposal will minimize the conflicts with the present land uses by using as
little farrnland as possible. When it is to cover some farmland, re-cultivation
will be considered, for restoring covered farmland after completion of
construction.
(b)   Intakes and outlets of tunnels are mostly located at slopes or gullies on both
banks of river courses and valleys. Spoil soil and rock materials will be
stockpiled, both temporarily and permanently, so as not to cause river course
blockage and create flooding hazards.
(c)    Dyke and slope protection works will be provided, at stockpile areas and tunnel
outlets, to prevent loss of materials washed away by water.
(d)   No spoil materials will be placed where there is existing good vegetation and
pleasing landscape.
(e)    Detailed engineering schemes have been or will be developed for placing spoil
soil and rock materials, and environmental monitoring during construction will
be carried out, as appropriate, to prohibit any improper placing.
(f)   In case of culverts embedded in cultivated areas, mature topsoils will be
properly preserved, in addition to proper disposal of surplus soils, and replaced
to reduce loss of soil fertility.
4.11.4.2     General Main Line Disposal
Excavation of the tunnels, culverts and other works involved in the WWTP will
produce a total quantity of 8.7075 million m3 spoil materials, covering the full length of
4.11 - 2



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                   Final Report
200 km along the alignments. These materials are tentatively planned to be placed at
45-50 spoil areas located at hills, valleys and gullies. Such spoil areas for the
excavation materials resulting from the ongoing GML segments are summarized in
Table 4.11.4-1 1. To ensure that disposal will be carried out as previously stated, and
that different disposal plans will be selected in line with different topographical
features, some typical plans are presented as follows for reference.
(a)    Yantousi Plan
As shown in Figure 4.11.4-2, a diversion dam with a length of about 120 m will be
built between the earth bench at El 1,258 m and the mountain slop at El. 1,263 m, to
divert the river water eastward and then southward into the original river channel. In
this way, a large area of flood land will be vacant west of the earth bench where the
road is at El 1,240 m and the river bed is at El 1,218 m, leaving a level difference of
some 22 m, with an average difference of 15 m. The vacant river course will be about
400 x 100 m, which will receive 400,000 m3 spoil excavation materials assuming a
stockpile height of 10 m. This will satisfy the GML construction requirements.
Assuming this place is used as stockpile area in actual construction, detailed schemes
will be envisaged in line with the requirements noted above, with adequate
consideration to dredging of the changed river course and provision of condition for
future topsoiling.
(b)   Majiashan Plan
A drainage culvert will be arranged northward at El 1,250 m in the river valley
southeast of Majiashan, with culvert dimensions satisfying a flood discharge of 30
m3/s. The distance between the two mountains above the culvert will be about 50 m.
Assuming a stockpile height of 15 m above the culvert, with the distance will be
increased to about 110 m. The provision of some 100 m culvert will meet the GML
construction requirements. But the leading-edge angle is required to be not more than
3O.
The recommended plan is illustrated in Figure 4.11.4-3.
(c)    Shuiquanhe Plan
This plan needs a rockfill dam with a length of 700 m. The purpose of this dam is to
prevent stockpile collapsing or sliding which will cause river course blockage (there is
no severe river water erosion as judged from the river course features). The stockpile
area will be about 68,000 m2 which meet the project GML construction requirements
assuming a height of 8 m.
Spoil materials will be placed here from north to south, with attention to future
topsoiling and recultivation. This stockpile area is illustrated in Figure 4.11.4-4.
Excavation materials resulting from the primary and secondary pumping stations may
be placed in the manner as previously described in Majiashan plan.

(a)    Guanhe Stockpile Area
Two stockpile areas will be identified in Guanhe River valley where the outlets of #1
tunnel, primary pumping station, and #2 tunnel are located. There is little vegetation
and flood flow in the gully located in back of Xiatuzhai north of Guanhe River. Earth
and rock materials from #1 tunnel boring may be placed here along the inner side of
the gully, with slope protection works completed upon the construction of the project.
This area will approximately hold 112,700 m3 earth and rock materials. Details are
given in Figure 4.11.4-5.
There is a large floodland area at the primary pumping station south of the Guanhe
River, convenient for the disposal of spoil materials. Mucking materials from #2 tunnel
outlet may be placed, as appropriate, along the south hillside. This part of the
materials, with a volume about 20,751 m3, will cover a total land area of approximately
1,500 m2. The stockpile height may be set at 1-2 m. A dyke of I m height will be built.
(b)   Longxugou Stockpile Area
Spoil soils from #2 and #3 tunnel outlets will be placed at the narrow Longxugou
gully. In order to avoid possible flood obstruction, it is recommended to provide a f2
m embedded culvert at the bottom of the gully, for spoil materials to be placed above.
The capacity of this area will be about 605 m3.
(c)   Xinhuxinyao Stockpile Area
All the outlets of #3 tunnel, primary station, and #4 tuanel are located in Xinhuxinyao
gully. Excavation materials from #3 tunnel outlet, located in a loess hill, will be placed
and levelled in the downstream floodland area, covering about 0.7 ha cultivated land
which will be recultivated upon completion of the project. Such materials stemming
from the outlet of #4 tunnel may be placed on both sides of the secondary pumping
station, with a dyke of 40-60 m height built along the river course. The stockpile
height will be 1.5 - 2 m. At the bottom of the gully, there is about 5,000 m2 floodland
which will hold large quantities of earth and rock materials.
(d)   Muguagou Stockpile Area
The excavation materials from #5 and #6 tunnel outlets may be placed on the north
side of Muguagou gully, which has a gentle slope west of the Mijiachuan River up to
the gully. When stockpiling activities are completed, slope protection works at an
angle of 50° will be built along the gully, with a height reaching from the gully bottom
up to the stockpile top. This area will receive approximately 349,774 m3 materials.
(e)   Wenling Stockpile Area
The stockpile area for #6 tunnel outlet is located in the gully north of Wenling Village.
Because the outlet is adjacent to this village, all materials must be moved to the gully
rather than arranged in the uphill direction. Otherwise, they will displace the farmland
and ruin the landscape here. Figure 4.11.4-6 illustrates the details.

Wan jiazhai Water Transfcr Project                                 Final Report
Materials from the embedded culvert at #6 tunnel will be placed in the depression
nearby, and levelled for future recultivation.
The intake of #7 Tunnel is immediately close to the gully south of the Shen-Shuo
railway under construction. This gully, wide and deep, is a good place for receiving
spoil materials. However, slope protection works must be provided to avoid water and
soil loss.
In addition, the materials from access tunnels to all tunnels will be placed, as
appropriate, in the vicinity of the outlets. In the case of large quantities, slope
protection works will be provided to prevent water and soil loss.
4.11.5    Summary and Conclusions
Historically CC's have often caused unnecessary environmental damage, sometimes
serious, simply because it is the nature of the CC, and of the Engineering Supervision
of Construction, to focus on expediting building of the projects' physical components,
with relatively low-priority attention to EPMs. However, experience has shown that it
is quite feasible/affordable for the CC to observe and comply with the EPMs specified
in EIA, provided these are included in the TOR for the CC's construction contract and
provided an ECI is made available to observe the CC's operations and to require
compliance.
A special environmental problem for WWTP/Phase I construction is disposal of tunnel
excavation materials so as not to cause environmental damage including use of lands
better used for farming, creation of flooding hazards, hazards of runoff of these
materials to cause pollution/damage, and dispoiling of environmental scenery. For
these reasons the WWTP/Phase I planning includes provision of detailed schemes so
that disposal will be accomplished in a manner which is environmentally sound, as
presented in Section 4.11.4.
The Expert Panel on Environment and Resettlement for the Xiaolangdi project has
been observing and evaluating actual environmental effects for the Xiaolangdi
construction stage for more than a year, with a report produced by the Panel every six
months. It is recommended that the YRDP Engineering staff for WWTP obtain and
study these reports, beginning with the report of September 1995 (Ref 211. 1).

1.1 In narrow gullies, culverts big enough for flood discharge should be embedded
in gully beds prior to earth material dumping on the gullies.
1.2 In wide gullies, earth material may be dumped along banks but obstructions to
flood discharge should be avoided.
1.3 On flood plain land, the top layer of the land should be firstly removed
temporarily. When disposal material has been piled to a thickness of 1-2 m, the
removed top layer is returned to top layer position.
1.4 Earth materials disposal should be planned to minimize interference with
existing land uses including farming.
1.5 The temporary earth material from excavation of embedded culverts should be
piled near the construction site and piled back on the culverts after the culverts are
completed.
2. Disposal Yard Protection

SECTION 4.12
INTERBASIN WATER TRANSFER FEASIBTLITYZ
4.12.1    Introduction
At maturity, the NNWWtTP will divert 1.2 billion m3 annually from the Yellow River at
Wanjaizhai reservoir (under construction). This volume represents over 2% of the
mean annual flow of the entire river, and about 5% of dry year flows. There are
substantial demands for water from downstream users, a need for large volumes of
water to flush sediment from the lower reach, and a need to keep steady flows at the
mouth to preserve estuarial environrnent including fish population. At issue, then, is
the adequacy of Yellow River flows at Wanjiazhai to support the diversions without
incurring unacceptable downstream environmental and economic costs.
First, it should be pointed out that the WWTP has been an approved component of the
Yellow River Basin Plan for the past two decades. That Plan, updated several times,
seeks to ensure that the planned uses of Yellow River water will be kept to levels that
permit water demand-supply balance in all but the driest years, and that any
environmental degradation involved in development be mitigated through protection
measures.
4.12.2    Evaluations with World Bank Model
Nevertheless, these issues were further investigated with the Basin Level Planning
Model (BLM) constructed for the World Bankl's Investment Planning Study of the
Yellow River Basin. That model simulates 56 years of hydrological input under a
variety of future planning scenarios, including the WWTP. The model investigated the
following issues with the following conclusions:
(a) Sediment Flushing
YRCC sediment specialists have estimated that 20-24 billion m3 are required on
average to flush sediment from the lower reach and prevent further aggradation of the
river bed. The BLM demonstrated that with the WWTP diversions, avert ue flows at
the estuary will still be in the acceptable range.
(b) Estuarial Stability
In recent years, the Yellow River has run dry at the mouth several times, with harmful
effects on the estuarial ecology and the fish population. The BLM demonstrated that
the frequency of running dry will not increase because of WWTP, given that its
diversions will be made from the Wanjaizhai reservoir constructed for the purpose of
storing water during periods of high flow.
(c) Lower Basin Water Balance
The BLM did show that the WWTP will result in less water available to irrigators in
the downstream provinces Henan and Shandong. However, each province in the Basin
is allocated a certain share (WWTP diversions are part of the allocation for Shanxi's
share): If Henan and Shandong are unable to obtain their shares, it will not be due to
4.12- I



Waniiazhai Water Transfcr Proiect                                  Final Report
the WWTP, but to the fact that some users upstream of Wanjaizhai extract more than
their shares. This problem is well known to YRCC authorities who are carefully
monitoring all diversions from the Yellow. The BLM also showed that the opportunity
cost of the \WWTP diversions are a fraction of the economic value of water to the
project, and that the rate of return remains acceptable when these costs are included.
Some additional information relating to the Lower Basin Water Balance, prepared by
the World Bankl WVWTP Mission's Economist, is given as follows:
(a) Local irrigation schemes throughout the YRB have led to the current and
increasing water shortages. In 1995, an estimated 86% of diversions went to
irrigation, against 14% for M$I including extra-basin transfers to Qingdao and Beijing.
In the upper reach, the provinces of Ningxia and Inner Mongolia have pursued
irrigation schemes without regard to respecting their allocations (much to YRCC's
frustration) and without regard to the economics of these schemes which involve
considerable (subsidized) pumping In the lower reaches, a good proportion of
diversions for irrigation is an unsanctioned (and highly dangerous) development on the
floodplain (evem between the main dikes). Throughout the YRB, irrigation has been
artificially promoted by a water pricing policy which ignores the opportunity cost of
water. Farmers pay nothing or a fraction of one yuan. From the WWTP work, we
now know that the willingness-to-pay of urban households is about 3 yuan and rising,
and that of industies at least 10 yuan.
(b) WWTP diversions have long been a part of the officially-sanctioned YRB Plan,
which includes strict limits by province on diversions. Combined, thos limits total 37
bcm which, allowing for returns, permits about 22 bcm for flushing sediment and
estuarial integrity.  In contrast, the YR Basin Level Model estimates that total
diviersins in 1995 were over 41 with less 20 available for flusing. shanxi's share of the
total allocation is 4 bmc, which will continue to be respected even under the full
operation of the WWTP.
(c) Shanxi irrigators are being increasingly squeezed as their supplies are transferred
(voluntarily or otherwise) to meet local M&I demands. If any meaningful water rights
exist in the YRB, these Shanxi irrigators should have preference over those mentioned
in (a) above. Without the WWTP, projection show a continuing and severe decline in
irrigation throughout Shanxi as it becomes more urban and industrialized. In the areas
to be served by the WWTP, the projected growth in urban household and municipal
water demands will lead to virtual cessation in both irrigation (except that using
recycled waste water) and industrial and mining activity. The observed secular decline
in surface water flows in these areas combined with rapidly falling groundwater tables
ensure this outcome.
(d) Shanxi has a long-standing right to WWTP water, and the economic returns from
it are probably the highest in YRB, with the possible exception of diversions to
Qingdao and Beijing. The opportunity costs of these diversions, based on lost hydro-
power from Sanmenxia and Xiaolangdi plus loss of irrigation in the lower reach, are
estimated to be 0.4 yuanlm3. In today's prices, this is about 0.7, still a fraction of the
returns WWTP will generate.
4.12-2



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Project                                  Final Report
(e) It can be concluded that water shortages in the YRB will not be solved by
foregoing the WWVTP, but through rigorous and forceful water management and
pricing. The covenants associated with Xiaolangdi are a step in this direction, and the
water pricing agreements to be negotiated with WWTP will comprise another positive
step.
Additonal details on the issue of availability of Y'RB water for transfer to the WWTP
service areas is given in Annex G of the present report.
4.12.3 Summary and Conclusions
WWTP has been an approved component of the Government's overall Yellow River
Basin Plan for the past two decades. This will divert about 2% of the mean annual
river flow and about 5 percent of dry year flows, but the Wanjaizhai storage is from
periods of higher river flow, and this should not pose hardships on downstream water
users. This issue was further investigated by the World Bank's evaluation of the
Xiaolangdi project using the Bank's Basin Level Planning Model.  These studies
confirned that the WWTP will not create problems for the downstream users assuming
that all "shareholders" of the river do not extract more than their allocated share.

SECTION 4.13
CONNECTION WORKS
4.13.1 Introduction
The overall VWWTP Phase I project will complete the GML, SML, and the Connection
Works to permit water to be delivered to the Taiyuan Service Area.
The Connection Works refers to the project component which will convey water from
Toumaying, the outlet of Tunnel No.7 of SML, to Huyan Water Treatment Plant of
Taiyuan City.
The purpose of Section 4.13 is to review the studies done by various institutions on
the Connection Works and to check these for EIA adequacy for all SEIs involved in
the project.
The following assessments are based on References 120, 153, and 157.
4.13.2 Project Description
4.13.2.1     Location and Components
As shown in Figure 4.13.2-1, the Connection Works connects the outlet of SML to the
Taiyuan Service Area. It starts from Toumaying, Ningwu County, passes Ningwu,
Jingle, Loufan counties and Gujiao city to the north suburb of Taiyuan City with a total
length of 184 km.
The current concept of the Connection Works, as described in Section 2.3.4 and as
shown in figure 4.13-2, includes (i) 81.2 km natural Fen river course from Toumaying,
the outlet of SML Tunnel No.7, to the existing Fen-I reservoir, (ii) 40.2 km
underground pipelines and 16.8 km tunnel from Fen-l reservoir to Huyan Water
Treatment Plant in the north suburb of Taiyuan City.
4.13.2.2     Design Criteria
The design criteria for the Connection Works are listed in Table 4.13.2-1.
4.13.2.3     Project Alternatives
Four project alternatives were studied and a prefeasibility study report made by SIDI in
Sept. 1995 ( Ref. 120). Alternative 2 (Figure 4.13.2-2) has been recommended as the
current project concept. The other alternatives are briefly discussed below, beginning
with the Alternative 4 which was the originally adopted scheme by YRDP.
(a)   Alternative 4 (natural water course)
This alternative (refer to Figure 4.13.2-5) makes use of the natural river course,
initially two (Fen-l and Fen-2) and ultimately three (with the addition of Haoshuigou)
4.13 - I



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project                                  Final Report
regulating reservoirs, and a set of twin tunnels to convey water from Fen-2 reservoir
(which is under construction by Shanxi Province on Fen River 80 km downstream
from Fen-l Reservoir and which is not a part of WTP) to the water treatment plant at
Huyan. This alternative was the original scheme envisaged by YRDP and is considered
the base case here for the comparison of the other alternatives.
Alternative 4 was considered not acceptable because of the serious water leak-age and
pollution problems in the section from Fen- I reservoir to Fen-2 reservoir.
(b)    Altemative I (full conduit)
Alternative I examines the use of a conduit over the full length of the Connection
Works from the Haoshuigou reservoir to the water treatment plant at Huyan,
bypassing both Fen-l and Fen-2 reservoirs, as shown in Figure 4.13.2-3.
Because of high costs and construction difficulties, this alternative currently was not
selected.
(c)    Altemative 3 (natural water course with leak-age reduction measures)
Alternative 3 (refer to Figure 4.13.2-4) makes use of the natural river course, as in the
case of Alternative 4, but an impervious liner is applied to the leakage zones in the
section from Fen-l reservoir to Fen-2 reservoir. Haoshuigou regulating reservoir and
the delivery of the water from Fen-2 to the treatment plant at Huyan are all similar to
Alternative 4.
High costs and impacts on groundwater in Taiyuan Service Area, especially on the
Jinci and Lancun springs, are the main reasons for the altemative being not selected.
Table 4.13.2-2 shows the major comparison of the four altematives.
4.13.3 Environmental Setting
4.13.3.1     Environmental Study Area (ESA)
The ESA for the Connection Works is described in Section 3.2.2 and is shown in
Figure 3.2.2-5.
4.13.3.2     Land Use
The engineering works to be constructed for the Connection Works mainly passes
Loufan county and Gujiao city. The land use of the townships in the project passing
area is listed in Table 4.13.3-1.
4.13.3.3     Natural Physical Resources
(a)    Climate
4.13 - 2



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proje;                                 Final Report
The climate in the project area is characterized by ex-tremes of temperature and rainfall.
The winter months experience cold temperatures, with extreme lows of -25.50C, and
very little precipitation. The ra:ifall is concentrated in the surmmer months when the
temperatures can reach 35.7- 3' 4°C. Rainfall across the area does not appear to vary
substantially being in the range o. 460480 mm annually. The maximum frosted earth
depth is in a range of 77-137 cm Table 4.13.3-2 shows the climatic features of the
ESA.
(b)   Topography
The Connection Works is located in the upstream of the Fen river basin. On the left
bank of the Fen river lies the Yunzhong mountain and on the right bank of the Fen
river lies the Luya mountain with several tributaries joining the Fen river along its
course, which first goes from north to southwest (Fen-I reservoir) and then mostly to
the east (Figure 4.13.2-2). The highest elevation in the region is in Ma'an mountain (El
2448m) which lies at the northwest, and "he lowest elevation is at the Fen river valley
near the Huyan Village (location of Huyan Water Treatment Plant), which lies at the
east with an elevation of 800 m.
The slope through the upper reaches of the river, between the outlet of the
Haoshuigou reservoir and Fen-I reservoir is 0.4%. The slope below the Fen-l
reservoir decreases to approximately 0.3%.
(c)   Geology
The Connection Works crosses four major tectonic regimes as it passes from the
headwaters of the Fen River down to the city of Taiyuan (Refer to Figure 4. 13.3-1 ):
(cl) The Ningjing Subsidence Block is comprised of gently folded
Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic and Jurassic sedimentary rocks within the
Ningiing Syncline, the core of which is under the Fen River. The most
abundant rock types are sandstones, mudstones, and shales. There are also
some Ordovician and Cambrian limestones (often karstic), dolomites and marls,
near Fen- 1 Reservoir and at the headwaters of the Fen River.
(c2) The Luliang Uplift Block is comprised of Archeozoic metamorphic rocks,
mainly gneiss and schist.
(c3) The Wutai Uplift Block is comprised of mainly flat lying or gently folded
Carnbrian, Ordovician, Carboniferous, and Permian sedimentary rocks.
Cambrian and Ordovician limestones (often karstic), dolomites and marls
generally outcrop at river level along most of the Fen River within this block.
An exception is an areai near Gujiao where Carboniferous and Permian
sandstones, shales, mudstones, and coal beds are found.
(c4) The Jinzhong Subsidence Basin is comprised of 380 m of alluvial
deposits, underlain by a series of horst (up-thrown block) and graben (down-
thrown block) bedrock structures.

(d)   Hydrogeology
(d 1) Groundwater Regimes
The Connection Works is dorninated hydrogeologically by three major
groundwater regimes (Refer to Figures 4.13.3-2 and 4.13.3-3):
(d 1. 1) Ground Water Area 1: Jingle and Fen I Reaches
This area is typified by high groundwater tables within the sandstone,
mudstone, shale and occasional limestone sequences of the Ningjing Syncline
and within the gneissic rocks in the Luliang Block. There are many springs in
this reach with abundant good quality karstic water from the limestones and
good quality, low yield water from the sandstones. A brief description of the
various groundwater classification is listed below.
Class                   IType                       Comments
Fissured sedimentary rock water   Good quality; low yield (0.2 - 0.5
lls) sources. Typical of Ningjing
Syncline formations
II     Metamorphic and intrusive       Good quality; low yield sources.
fissured rock aquifer water    Typical of formations near Fen I
Reservoir
Im      Karstic aquifer water           Good quality; high yield in areas of
eroded carbonate fissures & piped
karst caves of discharge areas.
IV      Combined karstic and fissured   Often of poorer quality and variable
yield
V       Alluvial deposit aquifer       River bed and valley terrace
aquifers, low yield above Lancun
and high yield in Taiyuan alluvial
aquifers
(dl .2) Groundwater Area 2 : Karstic Spring Catchment Areas in the Gujiao and
Fen 2 Reaches
This area is dominated by major karstic aquifers of the Jinci Springs and
Lancun Springs Catchment Areas.
For the most part the karstic groundwater table in the Jinci Springs Catchment
Area is in order of 50-100l in below the Fen River. Leakage from Fen River
infiltrates downwards directly through the karstic limestones (or through other
overlying, faulted and fractured rock) to the karstic aquifer. Once the water
reaches the aquifer it flows in a southerly, then southeasterly direction to
discharge at Jinci Springs. Here the water comes to the surface near the
piedmont faults bounding the Jingzhong Subsidence Basin.
4.13 - 4



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Project                                    Final Report
Within the Jinci Spring Catchment Area perched water tables occurs in the
alluvial deposits of the Fen River; or in the sedimentary rock units exposed
above river level, often discharging in small springs and adding minor inflows
to the Fen.
The western portion of the Lancun Springs Catchment Area is located in the
Fen 2 Reach (Refer to Figures 4.13.3-2 and 4.13.3-3). As shown on Figure
4.13.3-3, the portion of the Fen River located in the upstrearn 5 or so
kilometers of the future Fen-2 Reservoir is above the karstic groundwater
table and leakage from the Fen River occurs. Downstream of this area the
groundwater table is higher than the river level and several small springs can be
found.
The divide between the two springs catchment areas is near the upstream end
of the future Fen-2 reservoir. At present the location of this divide shifts either
to the east or west depending on the relative hydrologic conditions between
each aquifer.
In the past, abundant water from the two catchment flowed from the surface
springs at both Lancun and Jinci. By 1987, exploitation of the springs and other
alluvial aquifers (Groundwater Regime 3, described next) caused the spring
flows to decrease and in the case of Lancun to cease altogether.
The Lancun Water Source Station currently extracts 300,000 t/day of water
(70% of Taiyuan's daily requirements) from 15 wells drilled into the karstic
aquifer, just to the west of the piedmont faults. This continues to draw down
the karstic aquifer levels by approximately 2 m/yr. At present the groundwater
table around the wells is approximately 26 m below the ground level. The
Station is in the process of retrofitting their pumps, which currently have a
maximum lifting capacity of 30 m, to allow extraction from greater depths, to
provide longer term pumping capability.
The Jinci Springs area is protected for historic reasons by government
regulations which reportedly restrict well drilling in the area. There are,
however, a considerable number of existing factory wells just to the east of the
springs area in the alluvial deposits.
(dl .3) Groundwater Area 3: Taiyuan's Alluvial Aquifers
The thick alluvial aquifers (up to 380 m deep) within the Jinzhong Subsidence
Basin have been a major source of Taiyuan's domestic water for several
decades. The aquifers are fed from infiltration of precipitation, leakage from
perched river flows and by inflows from the karstic aquifers and springs.
To the north of Taiyuan, water is exploited from the alluvial aquifers for
domestic purposes by a series of deep wells. Groundwater tables are currently
at a depth of about 50 - 70 m. South of Taiyuan, additional wells have been
drilled by the aforementioned factories for their own domestic and industrial
purposes.

Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project                                Final Report
(d2)  Leakage
Leakage along the Fen River is quite significant, occurring in the following
three areas (Refer to Figures 4.13.3-3 and 4.131.3-4):
(d2. 1) Leakage Zone I (Loujiaqu to Longweitou, 10 km)
Leakage occurs into the karstic limestones. Leakage quantities are increased
due to the open nature of the Loujiaqu Fault Zone and accompanying shatter
belt. The river flows through a relatively narrow, steep walled, winding canyon
with few valley side terraces, and approximately 20-25 m of sand-gravel-cobble
river bed deposits.
(d2.2) Leakage Zone 2 (Gujiao to Zhaishang, 5 km)
Leakage occurs through the lower permeability sandstones and shales into the
underlying limestones, due to fractures associated with the Gujiao Faults and
shattered zones. The river bed is quite broad in this stretch and the river
deposits are similar to the previous zone.
(d2.3) Leakage Zone 3 (Zhaishang to Zhitou, 25 km)
Leakage occurs directly into the karstic limestone through fractures associated
with the Xiaota Fault Zone. The river flows through a 100-150 m wide, steep
walled, winding canyon with few valley side terraces, and approximately 25 m
of sand-gravel-cobble river bed deposits.
At present the leakage sector is shown to end at Zhitou, because the
groundwater table currently comes to the surface in this area (Refer to Figure
4.13.3-4) and the base of the karstic beds rises above the valley floor. Once the
Fen-2 dam is constructed, and the reservoir is impounded, the downstream
extent of the leakage area may extend all the way to the dam, as the head in the
reservoir will force the water into karstic beds on the valley sides as they
become inundated. The majority of the limestone beds in this area are,
however, formations in which karstic features are not well developed.
(e)   Soil/Erosion
The main soil types in the project area are mountain brown soil, brown soil and
meadow soil. The ingredient of these soils mainly are limestone, sandy shale, loess, and
alluvial deposit.
Erosion in the project area is serious. The Fen river basin area between Fen- I reservoir
and Fen-2 reservoir is about 2,348 km2 of which 80% has been eroded. The worst
case is in the project passing area of Gujiao City. Because of the high intensity and
large scale industrial development in recent years, large areas of natural vegetation
have been destroyed and the erosion has become worse and worse. By the end of
4.13 - 6



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final Reporl
1994, the eroded area increased by 365.5 km2 which is 32% of the total eroded area
(1143 kMn2) before the development.
The Sedimentation along the project area is discussed in Section 4.9.
(f)    Surface Water Hydrology
The Fen River rises in the Luya mountain of Guancen Mountain of Shanxi province
and runs generally south through a synclinal valley, then turns east to run through an
incised valley to exiting from the mountains, just north of Taiyuan. The upper reaches
of the catchment have mountain ridges which approach 2500 m elevation and the river
descends to exit near Taiyuan at an elevation of approximately 800 m. The Fen River
drainage basin is outlined in Figure 4.13.3-5.
The annual runoff of the Fen River as well as its tributaries has been measured for over
40 years by a number of gauging stations. The mean annual runoff at the Fen-I
reservoir is 368 M m3 (5,268 kM2)
Floods in the project area of the Connection Works are mainly formed by storms which
happen usually in July and August each year with characters of short duration and
limited range resulting in localized flooding.
The flood data for Fen-l Reservoir is listed below:

4.13.3.4.1    Forest and Other Vegetation
According to the vegetation zoning in Shanxi (Ref 163), the ESA along the
Connection Works belongs to the north subregion of the warm temperate deciduous
and broad-leaved forest zone. The vegetation mainly consists of Dendranthenrna,
Rosaceae, Leguminosae, Gramineae, Ranunculaceae, and Cruciferae, with a coverage
rate of approximately 35%. Out of these, herbosa and bush are predominant. The
forests are simple in types and small in distributions, with scattered forests of Poinus
tabulaeformis, Platycladus orientalis, Q. liaotungensis, Robinia pseudoacacia, and
river-bank poplar and willow, providing a forest coverage rate of some 6%. The
vegetation and plant resources are described as follows.

families. The species often found include 60 medicine herbs, 18 starch and sugar-
yielding plants, 20 oil plants, 23 feed plants, 22 fibre plants, 46 ornamental flowers,
and 60 landscape plants. However, basically there are no rare and endangered species
in the project area.
4.13.3.4.2    Terrestrial Wildlife
The overall ESA along Connection Works falls within Taiyuan area of the Loess
Plateau subfauna, North China fauna, Palearctic realm, as defined in the zoogeographic
zoning in China. Within Shanxi Province, it belongs to the south temperate coniferous
and broad-leaved zoogeographic zone in the middle and east parts of Shanxi. There are
111 species of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife, including 5 amphibians, 7 reptiles, 77
birds, and 22 mammals. The floodland on the Fen River banks is the major habitat of
water birds. Also, other birdies and beasts are often found. The predominant species
are passermontanus saturatus + M. alba + black-bone coast tringa, with common
species of Alectoris graeca, Galerida cristata, Hirundo rustica, H. daurica, M. eitreol,

4. 13.3.5    Development Resources
4.13.3.5.1   Industrv
Dujiaoqu Township is a poor area located in Loufan County, downstream of the
existing Fen-I reservoir. Industry here is less developed, only three villages, namely,
Dujiaoqu, Luojiaqu and Longweitou, have small village enterprises, with an annual
gross output value of industry of 191,000 yuan.
Gujiao is located in the west part of Taiyuan City. It has rich mineral resources and
relatively advanced industrial activities. Coal mining and coking industries are the most
important sources of income. In the ESA, two villages within Suoyu Township
produce a yearly industrial and agricultural output value of 180 million yuan, including
97%/O contributed by industry. The three villages governed by Zhenchengdi Township
produce a yearly industrial and agricultural output value of 95.0942 million yuan,
which includes 85.9377 million yuan (90%) industrial contributions. Industries and
transportation services are the major income sources of Fengpingling Village in
Jijiazhuang Township, while all the 3 villages in Hekou Township and Yongshuqu
Village in Gujiao Township mainly depend on exportation of labor forces.
4.13.3.5.2    Ag_culture
The farmers of 5 villages in Dujiaoqu Township mainly live on farming, with a total
cropped area of 432 ha. With poor farmland and out-of-date farning facilities, the
annual gross output value of agriculture is only 682,000 yuan.
Gujiao City governs a total cultivated land area of 154,000 ha, including 16,200 ha for
agricultural use. More than 95% of the available farmland is distributed in mountainous
and hilly areas, and devoted to the grown of coarse cereal crops. Table 4.13.3-3 shows
the farmland areas distributed in the 10 villages of Gujiao and also Dujiaoqu Village
involved in the Connection Works.
4.13.3.5.3   Infrastructure
There are roads available to all of the 15 villages involved in the ESA. Taiyuan-Jingle
road, a Grade 2 highways from Fen-I reservoir to Hekou Township, is being built,
which will represent more convenient communications for Dujiaoqu Township.
There are Tai-Lan railway and Tai-Nmg highway connecting Gujiao to the outside.
The railway capacity is 8 million tons/year. On the highway, the actual traffic volume is
as high as 8,000 vehicles/day (but the limit only is 2,000 vehicles/day). Plus the inferior
surface conditions, there is severe congestion. This situation is inadequate to meet the
economic development. The on-going Tai-Jing highway will relax the transportation
pressure in Gujiao, and will improve the communications in the overall Connection
Works.
The residents in the ESA suffer from the shortage of water. In Dujiaoqu Township, the
drinking water source mainly depends upon the imported water delivered through the

pipeline from Fen-1 reservoir to CTujiao, and some groundwater. The water demand in
Gujiao will reach 61.22 million m;/year by 2000, but the availability will be only 27.8
million m', representing a large gap. However, the aforesaid pipeline will provide a
daily flow of 100,000 m3, plus the water supply from other water retention works and
some groundwater, a total amount of 63.5 million m3 water will be available by 2000.
Although a balance will be achieved, water supply will be still tight. At present,
groundwater is the major source of drinking water in the 10 villages governed by
Gujiao, only a few of them have tap water.
All of the 15 villages have power supply, telecommunications, and public address
facilities. Each township has its own post and telecommunications office. And all
villages have TV program receiving facilities.
4.13.3.6     Oualitv of Life Resources
4.13.3.6.1    Socio-economics
Within the ESA, the 5 villages in Loufan County have a total population of 3,586 who
are still in property. The economic development is very slow and the overall living
standard is at a low level as a result of less resources availability, out-of-date farming
practice and poor personal quality.
Gujiao has more mineral resources. Also, many enterprises and agencies, institution
organizations are located here. These have greatly promoted the economic
development. The 10 villages in the ESA, with a total population of 12,026, all have
advanced industry and higher quality of life (refer to Table 3.7.2-2 for the income
levels in 1994).
4.13.3.6.2    Education and Recreation
Loufan is a poor county where education level is on the lower side. At present, there is
only one middle school in Dujiaoqu Township. All villages have their own primary
schools, but teachers are inadequate. With poor facilities, cultural and recreational
activities are monotonous, and watching TV is almost the only thing that the villagers
can do. However, the Fen-l Reservoir Management Bureau, located in the vicinity, has
better cultural and educational amenities, which somewhat make up for the inadequacy
of cultural and recreational facilities in this region, and contributes to improving the
local farners' quality and education level.
All of the 10 villages involved in Gujiao have their own primary schools. There is one
middle school at the township. However, teachers are inadequate both in quantity and
quality. Watching TV is also the main recreational activity. Gujiao City, mainly
depending on mining activities, has faster economic development. At present, there are
altogether 349 schools, including 18 middle schools, 315 primary schools, and 15
schools for the education of adults, with a total student population of 22,646, and a
total teaching and administrative staff of 2,206. In addition, there are 88 schools of
various types in the mining sector, with better teacher resources. In the city, 99.3% of
the school-age children are at school. This rate is 100% in the urban areas and 99% in
the rural areas of the city. People here enjoy colorful cultural and recreational activities
4.13 - 11



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                  Final Report
in theaters, ballrooms, public cultural activities (for example, yangko, lantern show),
public address, TV and other activities (antiques, bookshops, etc.). Gujiao City has
promoted the cultural and recreational development in the surrounding areas.
4.13.3.6.3    Cultural Relics
There are 3 archeological sites in Gujiao, namely Yinfenghuangyan Stone-age Site,
Shiqianfeng Stone-age Site, and Lijiazhuang Stone-age site. All these are important
archeological sites of Taiyuan. Temples in Gujiao are in large number, but most of
them are torn and tattered, representing little value for visitors. These sites are not
covered in this ELA because the project (all pipes and tunnels) will not cause impact
on them.
4.13.3.6.4    Public Health
Public health and medical care amenities are relatively poor in Dujiaoqu Township.
There is a hospital but its facilities are limited and medical staff are not so qualified.
The endemic diseases are endemic goiter and dental fluorine, which, however, have
very low morbidities.
Likely, public health and medical service are poor in all of the 10 villages nearby.
These villages, however, are close to Gujiao City which attaches adequate importance
to the management of public health and disease control, thus indirectly improving the
hygienic conditions in the vicinity. According to the information on disease situation in
1994, the communicable diseases in Gujiao are hepatitis, dysentery, bovillae, scarlatina,
brochocephalitis, encephalitis B, malaria, and gonorrhea, with a general morbidity of
347.93/100,000, including 86.54% contributed by enteric diseases. In Zhenchengdi,
Jijiazhuang, and Gujiao Township, the morbidity is higher. The predominant endemic
disease in Gujiao is cretinism, but it is now almost under control.
4.13.4 Impact Assessment
As discussed in Section 4.13.2, the Connection Works comprises 81.2 km natural river
course, 40.2 km underground pipelines, and 16.8 km tunnel. The environment impacts
of WWTP on 81.2 km natural Fen river course and existing Fen-1 Reservoir are
discussed in Section 4.8.4. The following SEIs are identified for the rest of the
Connection Works:
* Water quality
* Land acquisition
* Resettlement
* Erosion/sedimentation
* Hydrology
* Public health
* Ecology

Waniiazhai Water Transfer Project                                Final Report
4.13.4.2     Land Requisition
A total of 250.3 ha land is planned to be requisitioned for the construction and
operation of the Connection Works of which 15.6 ha will be permanently occupied by
the project and 234.7 ha will be required during the construction period. The land
acquisition is listed below
Land Type                          Permanent Temporary  Total
Farmland                           10.0       68.5       78.5
Unused Farmland or Residential Land  0.05     14.2        14.25

Nursery                             .         15.8       15.8
Wasteland                          5.55       18.2       23.75
State Owned Flood Land                    _103.1         103.1
Total                              15.6      234.7       250.3
From the data listed above it is seen that most of the land (94%) to be requisitioned
will be occupied temporarily, of which over a half are state owned floodland or
wasteland. The construction and operation of the project would not produce significant
impacts on the land use of the ESA.
The impacts of available land reduction and compensation are discussed in Section 4.5.
4.13.4.3     Erosion/Sedimentation
It is also seen from the land requisition shown in Section 4.13.4.2 that most of the land
to be requisitioned is for the use for dumping sites and project construction. The major
environmental concern is the reduction of vegetation and the potential erosion during
both construction and operation stages. Similar revegetation and resurfacing measures
should be taken and strict construction operation constraints should be followed by
construction contractors as discussed in Section 4.11, and their activities should be
monitored by the EMO to be established as discussed in Section 6.5.3..
With proper construction operation constraints followed by construction contractors,
the impacts of the project on erosion will be limited and will not worsen the serious
erosion situations caused by the rapid industrial development (see Section 4.13.3.3).
The impacts of the project on sedimentation are discussed in Section 4.9.
4.13.4.4    Resettlement: See Section 4.5
4.13.4.5    Hvdrolozv
The Connection Works may be hydrologically divided into two reaches
v Reach I from Toumaying to Fen-l reservoir;
* Reach 2 from Fen-l reservoir to Huyan Water Treatment Plant.
4.13 - 13



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                  Final Report
The impacts of the diverted water on the hydrology in the natural river course of
Reach I are discussed in Section 4.8.4. (EIA for Fen-l reservoir).
The project will have no significant impacts on both surface water and groundwater
hydrology in Reach 2 because the project in this reach comprises either underground
pipes or tunnels.
One potential flooding hazard may be caused by pipeline failure in Reach 3, especially
in the area of Gujiao City. Monitoring and protection measures are to be provided as
discussed in Section 4.3 (hydrology).
4.13.4.6     Public Health
During the project construction period, a total of 4,800 workers at average and 6,860
at peak will be employed on the project. A potential hazard is the breakout of epidemic
diseases among the workers and the local people near the construction sites. Measures
described in Section 4.6 are to be taken and followed to prevent it from happen.
4.13.4.7     Eco-Environmental Impact
The eco-environmental impacts to be posed by the Connection Works will exist mainly
in the construction period.
4.13.4.7.1    Impacts on Terrestrial Plants
The natural vegetation in the ESA for Connection Works is almost all bush and prairie,
except for some artificial forests, crops and orchards, at the full length of 59.4 km.
Excavation of tunnels and disposal of excavation materials will destroy some of the
vegetation, including such species as poplar, willow, elm, Sophora japonica, Hippohae
rahamnoides, Ostryopsis davididana, Rosa xanthina, L. bicolor, Ziziphus jujuba var.
spinosa, Portulaca oleracea, trigonella ruthenica, Taraxacum mongoliurn, Thymus
mongolicus, and Plantago asiatica. All these, however, are common species widely
distributed in the ESA. Since only a small part of them will be sacraficed, the project
will not result in any extinction of species or variation of vegetation types. Provided
restoration measures are taken as stated in Section 4.11, the destroyed part of
vegetation will be recovered after the completion of the project.
4.13.4.7.2   Impacts on Terrestrial Wildlife
During the construction stage, the terrestrial wildlife will be subject to significant noise
impacts to be caused by blasting operations, and by construction equipment such as
vehicles, mixers, and excavators. Such noise will disturb the wildlife, including Aves,
(Motacilla, A. spinotletta, Alcedo atthis, Tringaocropus, and Anititae), amphibia
(bufonid, frog), reptilia (snake, Gekko japonicus, lacertid). Also, this disturbance will
be extended to involve the birds (Ardea cinerea, Falco, Alectoris graeca, Upupa epops,
Pica pica, and Emberiza) and mammals (Canis lupus, Vulpes rulpes, Mustila sibrica,
Felis bengalensis, Lepus capensis, and Tamias sibiricus) inhabiting in the adjacent
mountains. Such impacts will last for a period of 1-5 years. In addition, the excavation
of tunnels, disposal of spoil materials and mobilization of construction workers will

Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                  Final Report
occupy some of the existing habitats, thus causing some loss of wildlife and increasing
the density in the adjacent region. This will affect the ecological balance to some extent
in limited time. After the completion of the project, however, new balance will be
achieved.
Some rare animals, for instance, Cricus cyancus, Aquila chrysactos, Ciconia nigra,
Ardea cinerea, Halcyon piteta, and Asio otus, will be disturbed, but their habitats will
not be destroyed because most of them are live in high mountain areas or on cliffs far
from the transmission lines..
All the above mentioned impacts on the terrestrial wildlife will be only limited to the
construction period, and will disappear upon completion of the project.
.4.13.4.7.3    Impacts on Aquatic Ecolont
A small amount of waste water will be discharged into the local river courses during
the construction stage. Also, the construction of reverted syphons and cofferdams will
bring about some effects on the aquatic ecology of the Fen River. This may further
reduce the present small species and quantities of cyanophyta and chlorophyta in
limited water areas, and enlarge the species and quantities of pollution-resistant N.
palea W. Smith, and S. acus Kutz variants. The impacts on zoobenthos and fish will be
reduction of populations, but the affected species will be common ones distributed in
limited areas. Generally, such impacts will not be significant, and will be subsequently
offset upon completion of the project.
4.13.5 Summary and Conclusions
The Connection Works is a key component of the overall WWTP which will convey
the diverted water from the outlet of the SML to Taiyuan Service Area. The
Connection Works, to be completed in Phase I, makes use of natural river course of
Fen river system up to Fen-I reservoir and of underground pipes and tunnels from Fen-
1 reservoir to the Huyan Water Treatment Plant of Taiyuan City. Studies on the
project show that no significant adverse impacts on forests/wildlife, on cultural values,
or on aquatic ecology are expected. The main potential for negative effects are land
requisition and erosion during the construction period.   Hence, revegetation,
resurfacing and construction disposal control measures have been designed and are
included in the plan. These measures must be followed by construction contractors
and be monitored by EMO of YRDP during the project construction as specified in
Section 4.1 1.

SECTION 4.14
GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISStTES
The primary environmental concerns, from the global point of view, are: (i) earth
warming, (ii) ozone layer increase, and (iii) biological diversity degradation.
Because the VWWTP components which are above ground are in areas which are
already "humanized", with little significant remaining natural ecological resources, the
project expected to have any significant effects on the biodiversity situation in the ESA
region. However, the monitoring program to be managed by EMO will include an
annual survey of the status of ecology in ESA including forests, swamps, and wildlife.
The project does not involve use or production of substances to be discharged to
atmosphere which will contribute to ozone layer depletion.
The project will require expenditure of a considerable amount of electrical energy for
enabling pumping of the imported water into the service areas, but this total amount is
insignificant in terms of China's production of earth warming gases from burning of
coal.  Hence, the project should have no significant impact on China's total
contribution to earth warming.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
4.15.1 Summarn Presentation
Figure 4.15-] has been prepared to summarize the entire EIA process as applied to
WWTP/Phase 1. This includes the results of the above discussions of Sections 4.1 to
4.14 and also of Chapter 5.
4.15.2 How Environmental Protection Will Be Assured
Figure 4.15-1 shows that, while the project does pose a number of significant
environmental hazards, each of these hazards has been duly controlled in the overall
project plan by means of (i) modifying the planning of the project's physical
components so that each component incorporates appropriate EPMs, (ii) ensuring that
the construction tender documents incorporates the EPMs to be observed by the
Construction Contractor (CC), (iii) monitoring of the CC's operations during the
construction stage by the Environmental Construction Inspectors (ECIs) furnished by
EMO, including modifications in the project plan found to be needed by the
monitoring, (iv) monitoring by the EMO of start-up testing of project components, (v)
continuing periodic monitoring of all project components during the operations stage
(20 years), including modifications in the project plan to be made when indicated to be
needed and identified and justified by the monitoring, including planning and carrying
out of any special studies indicated by the monitoring to be needed, and including
identification, planning and arranging for implementation by YRDP of any
environmental enhancement measures which can be readily incorporated into the
project, and (vi) implementing the recommended special training program (Chapter 7).
In order to ensure that the EPMs noted above will be positively carried out, it is
essential that YRDP establish an effective EMO as soon as possible, not later than the
time of WB Loan Agreement, to be an integral part of the YRDP management system
(Chapter 8).
4.15.3 Optimal Use of Imported Water
The environmental constraints noted above apply (i) not only to the physical
components of the overall project, namely the GML, the SML, and the Connection
Works, all under direct YRDP control, but (ii) also to ensuring optimal use of the
imported water as discussed in Chapter 5. The latter will involve a variety of measures
to be carried out by various Shanxi Provincial and Local Agencies. Based on
consultation with these agencies, it is recommended that a new agency be established
to achieve this coordination, and suggestions are given for an appropriate agency
including organization and functions.
4.15.4 Management of Significant Environmental Issues
Assuming that the provisions of Section 4.15.2 are carried out, then, as shown in
Figure 4.15-1, the environmental benefits to accure from WU'TP will be very great,

and this wvill be achieved with only some minor and acceptable environmental losses,
with respect to surface water hydrology, there will be some small loss in the level of
flood protection on furnished by Fen-l reservoir, but this will be minor because
siltation in Fen-l reservoir has largely decreased the reservoir storage available for
flood control.

CHAPTER 5
WN'ATER SUPPLY AND POLLUTION CONTROL
5.1          INTRODUCTION
The goals of the WWTP are (a) to bring new water to the Taiyuan service area to
relieve the water shortage and meet future projected requirements, and (b) to ensure
optimal use of this expensive imported water including recycling and water pollution
control. Chapter 5 is related mainly to Item (b). The project plan is to divert Yellow
River water in two phases: phase one would have involved delivery of 365 million
m3/y or I million m3/d, of water to Taiyuan at beginning of year 2001 and phase two,
the delivery of the remaining 275 m3/y or 0.76 million m'/d of water, would start in
2004. Figure 5.1-1 shows the Taiyuan service area. In order to achieve this objective,
it will be important to assess current water demand and supply, forecast future water
demand and evaluate the quantity and quality of potential new supplies. The water
must be treated and distributed for industrial, urban and other uses.  Therefore,
increasing the water supply will require additional or new treatment facilities as well as
improved and widened distribution systems.
The key environmental issue for the project is the potential water pollution implications
arising from the transfer of additional, clean water from the Yellow River to Taiyuan
where a significant portion of it will become wastewater. Unless the wastewater is
reused, it will be discharged to the Fen River. Therefore, it is also important to assess
current wastewater treatment and disposal practice, forecast future wastewater quality
and quantity, evaluate potential environmental impacts of additional wastewater
discharges on river water quality and the measures required to mitigate the impacts.
The cost of the new water will be very high. To ensure optimal use of the total
freshwater supply in Taiyuan, including both imported and local resources, the target
should include:
(a) Efficient water supply system with minimum wastage.
(b) Maximum feasible reuse (for both people and industry).
(c) Maintain acceptable water quality in Fen River (within city, downstream).
(d) Municipal sewerage system (collection, treatment, disposal) as needed for (b) (c).
(e) Industrial waste management as needed for (b) (c).
(f) Attention to solid waste management as needed for (c).
(g) Minimize any water use for agriculture, including reuse, where such water is
needed for higher priority uses.
This chapter includes 5 main sections: Water Supply, Water Pollution Control, Water
Quality, Integrated Management for Water Supply and Pollution Control, and
Achievements of Environmental Management in Taiyuan City.
Drawings are included here showing the organization of key Taiyuan City agencies
involved in the chapter 5 evaluation. These include (i) Figure 5.5.1-2, showing the

Taiyuan City comprises 3 urban districts (Nancheng, Beicheng and Hexi), three
counties (Quingxu, Yangku and Loufan), north and south outskirts and one city
(Gujiao), with a total area of about 7,000 km2 and a total population of 2.21 million in
1993. The city is located in the semi-arid area where the average annual rainfall for
Taiyuan from 1956 through 1993 is about 470 mm, with the highest rainfall at 718 mm
and the lowest, 226 mm.
Both surface water from Fen River and tributaries and groundwater are used within the
City. The water sources data for the year 1991 to 1993 are shown in Table 5.2.1-1.
Groundwater accounts for about 65 to 69 % of the total water resource, and is used
primarily for domestic including irrigation of green belts and industrial uses. Surface
water from Fen River is used for agricultural/farm irrigation uses although some is
used for low grade industrial applications such as cooling. Wastewater is also being
recycled for reuse mainly for agricultural irrigation, not city irrigation, purposes and is
accounted for the remaining 14 % of the total water supply, as shown from Table
5.2.1-1.
5.2.1.1.2    Water Transmission
The Taiyuan City is served by the following three delivery systems:
(a)    Taiyuan Water Supply Company
The company provides water to some 1.45 million people in the urban areas covering
100 km2. It operates 9 water distribution/treatment plants providing 410,000 cm/d.
They include three (3) major water works; Lancun, Xizhang, Zaogou, and six (6) other
smaller water works with numbers 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10. There are a total of 87 wells, 5
pumping stations and 608 km of delivery and distribution pipes (diameter larger than
100 mm) located throughout the city.
(b)   Municipal Water Resources Management Commission
The commission provides water to the suburban districts and the counties as well as
providing surface water to the power and steel industries and for agriculture.  It
5-2



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Project                                    Final Report
provides about 90,000 crn/d of water from Fen-l reservoir to serve mainly industrial
facilities including Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plants, Taiyuan Power Plant No. I and
Taivuan Chemical Plant.
(c)   Individual Industrial Water Supply Systems
Many industrial plants operate their own well systems to provide water for their own
use. The total amount is estimated at 234,000 cm/d. Major sources include Taiyuan
Iron and Steel (19 wells), Jingan Chemical Plant (15 wells), Shanxi Mining Bureau
System (18 wells), and Chemical Industrial Zone (86 wells).
The total water supply capacity excluding water for agricultural irrigation uses is about
734,000 cm/d or 437 mcm/year for 1995.
5.2.1. 1.3   Water Treatment
Taiyuan Water Supply Company treats groundwater using disinfection (chlorination) at
the well head and at fonvarding stations. No other treatment is used for groundwater.
Surface water are primarily used for low grade industrial purposes such as cooling, and
receive no treatment other than settling out of suspended solids. Many industries pre-
treat surface water for their own use, but details of treatment are not available for the
present study.
5.2.1.1.4    Water Distribution System
Taiyuan Water Supply Company provides water to three principal areas in the city:
West, Northeast and Southeast. The west area is fed from Xizhang works, whereas
the east area is fed from the Lancun and Zaogou works. The water distribution system
is between 10 to 30 years old. The service areas covered by the water distribution
system are shown in Figure 5.2.1-2. Large industrial companies such as Steel Mill and
Chemical Plants have their own distribution systems.
The water distribution system is reported to have a 6 to 7 % water leakage rate based
on readings taken at city meters. The number does not include losses in distribution
networks downstream of the meters. This low percentage leakage rate could be the
result of low pressures within the system due to the shortage of water.
5.2.1.1.5    Water Uses
Water supplies are for industrial, domestic/municipal which includes irrigation of city
parks, and agricultural irrigation uses. Estimated water uses for Taiyuan from 1991 to
1993 are shown in Table 5.2.1-2. Industrial use accounted for about 54 % of the total
water use in 1993. Based on the population data of 2.21 million people, per capita
supply for domestic and municipal uses in 1993 can be calculated to be about 124 I/d.
This number is low as compared to the national average of about 174 lId in China
(105).
5-3



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final Report
Taiyuan is primarily an industrial city. The major industries are coal mining, power
generation, steel, machinery and chemicals. Most of the industry is concentrated in the
main urban area of the city, with about 15 % in the northern outskirts and in the Gujiao
city. The location of the major industries including Taiyuan Steel Company, No. 2
Power Station, Paper Mill, Xi Yu Coal Mine, Gas Company, Main Chemical Factories,
Pharmaceutical Factory, No. I Power Station and Fertilizer Factory, is shown in
Figure 5.2.1-3. Most of the manufacturing facilities are located along the west of the
city center. Estimated water uses for the major industries in Taiyuan for 1991 to 1993
are shown in Table 5.2.1-3. Fourteen industries accounts for 85 % of the total
industrial use of 274 mcmily.
5.2.1.1.6    Water Balance
Based on the water supply and use information in 1993, the water balance has been
developed for Taiyuan and is shown in Table 5.2.14.
The cities are over pumping (i.e. mining) groundwater in an effort to meet demand and
are creating serious subsidence problems throughout the area as documented at a
number of locations (106,111.2). Over pumping was estimated by the Municipal
Water Resources Commission to be 960,000 cm/d compared to a safe yield of 73 5,000
cm/d. Over abstraction has resulted in groundwater levels declining in some areas by 2
to 3 m per year, natural springs drying up, many wells drying up or having to be
deepened. Abstraction depths are over 200 m in the south of the city, but less to the
north (around 120 m). The losses appear to be substantial, but the cost estimate of the
losses is beyond the scope of EIA. It is crucial to stop over pumping when the new
water becomes available.
5.2.1.1.7   Pricing and Cost Recovery
Tayuan Water Supply Company charges RMB 0.7/m3 for domestic users and RMB
l1 /m3 for industrial users. Presumably, these charges are based on recovering the
cost of investment and operation. Both industrial and domestic users are metered as
bulk supplies, with residents in an apartment block. There are about 300,000 domestic
meters.
5.2.1.1.8    Management System/Organization
Water supply in the Taiyuan city is primarily in the hands of Tayuan Water Supply
Company and Municipal Water Resources Management Commission. Municipal
Water Resources Management Commission is responsible for groundwater supplies
which are not serviced by the Taiyuan Water Supply Company. With the advent of
new water, Taiyuan Water Supply Company will be responisible for transporting,
treating, and distributing the new water.-
5.2.1.1.9    Efficiency of Usage
The water supply system of the Taiyuan Water Supply Company appeared to be well-
maintained, and the limited water supply reasonably allocated (811). However, the
inadequate water supply in the past has led to the industrial, domestic and agricultural
5-4



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                  Final Report
users competing among each other for the groundwater supply. A more rational
approach to management of groundwater and surface water supply will be essential
when the new water becomes available.
The Water Supply Company will likely face many challenges in the future. When the
new water is here, the high pressures in the distribution system could cause bursts and
increased leakage, so that a comprehensive leakl detection and prevention program will
have to be developed. The company should start developing the program as soon as
possible. In addition, the company has no experience in operating the new water
treatment plant.  Therefore, technical assistance and training for the staff in the
management of the water supply system may be necessary.
5.2.2        Plans for Future
5.2.2.1      Future Water Demand Forecast
Several studies have been conducted over the last few years to estimate present water
demand/supply and forecast water demand for the years 2002, 2010, and 2020 for the
Taiyuan city (102, 106, 107, 111.2, 112, 201). The study by the Tianjin Survey and
Design Institute (111.2) in May of 1995 presents the most complete assessment of
water supply and demand for Taiyuan City. Water supply data for the study were
based on estimates of available surface water, available groundwater, and sewage reuse
for agricultural irrigation. The water consumption data were developed on the basis of
industrial, urban and agricultural uses in 1993. The industrial water use estimate relied
upon the results of a survey of industries in Taiyuan. According to the report, the
metallurgy, power, coal, chemical and machinery industries account for 85 % of the
total industrial water use in Taiyuan city. The urban water use projections were based
on a population forecast and evaluations of other water demands.  Overall, the
approach appears comprehensive and inclusive. The water demand forecasted in this
section will be compared to the results from the Tianjin Survey and Design Institute.
Water demand forecast can be developed by forecasting the municipal demand and the
industrial and agricultural demands. Municipal demand forecast is normally based on
the projections in population while industrial and agricultufral demand forecast is
usually based on the industrial and agricultural growth. Table 5.2.2-1 shows the key
economic indicators including population and industrial and agricultural outputs for
Taiyuan for years 1993, 2002, 2010 and 2020 (111.2). These data were used to
forecast the demand.
5.2.2.1.1    Municipal Water Demand Forecast:
Municipal water demand generally includes domestic use anrd public irrigation to
maintain city parks and gardens. Fore'casting of domestic water demand is based on
population projections and per capita consumption rates. Table 5.2.2-2 illustrates a
forecast of domestic water use for the City of Taiyuan. The population projections for
the forecast are based on Table 5.2.2-1 and the per capita consumption rates on
estimates by the China Institute for Radiation Protection (CIRP) (107). The public
irrigation water demand forecast was developed primarily on an estimate of the
projected expansion of the city green area.
5-5



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                 Final Report
5.2.2.1.2    Industrial Water Demand Forecast
The report by CIRP documents industrial output and water use in Taiyuan for the
period 1991-1993 according to industry (107). The industrial output and industrial
categories include metallurgy, electric power, coal, chemical, machinery, building
materials, forestry, food, textile, sawing, tanning, paper making, stationary and other
miscellaneous operations. Based on the industrial output and water use data, the
output per unit water use for each industry can be calculated and are shown in Table
5.2.2-3 through 5.2.2-5 for year 1991 to 1993. It is apparent that there was little or no
growth in water use for many industrial groups between 1991 and 1993. Growth was
limited by a shortage of water.
The ratios shown in Table 5.2.2-5 can be used to forecast the future water use since
they are relatively constant. To forecast the water demand, the industries have been
segregated into 5 major groups: metallurgy, electric power, coal, chemical and
miscellaneous. Table 5.2.2-6 shows the industrial water demand forecast for the 5
major industrial groups in Taiyuan.
5.2.2.1.3    Agricultural Water Demand Forecast
Water demand for agricultural uses was also estimated using the output projections
shown previously in Table 5.2.2-1. This does not include irrigation use for city parks
or gardens, which is under domestic/municipal demand. The forecasted agricultural
water demand is shown in Table 5.2.2-7.
5.2.2.1.4    Total Water Demand Forecast
Table 5.2.2-8 summarizes the water demand forecasts for municipal, industrial and
agricultural sectors. A spreadsheet has been developed which predicts municipal,
industrial and agricultural water demand from population and industrial and
agricultural growth projections, and the printout of the spreadsheet is attached here as
Table 5.2.2-9.
5.2.2.2      Future Water Balance with and without the WWTP Project
Based on the information developed in the above sections, water demand, supply and
balance for the years 2002, 2010, and 2020 for the city of Taiyuan have been
developed. The results are shown in Tables 5.2.2-10. The table also shows the
potential impact of WWTP on water demand and supply by including water balance
forecasts with and without the WWTP project.
Several observations and conclusions can be drawn from the data in Table 5.2.2-10:
(a) The forecasts of water demand for the year 2002 and beyond for Taiyuan city are
based on reasonably expected industrial and urban growth (111 .2). Without the
WWTP project, a shortage of over 200 mcm is projected beyond the year 2002.
This projection implies that, unless alternate sources of water can be developed,
5-6



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                 Final Report
lower living standards will result due to increases in population and depletion of
groundwater.
(b) According to the projections, the additional new water from WWTP should be
sufficient to meet water demand through 2010. By optimizing water recycling and
wastewater reuse, the water supply should be able to meet the demand for Taiyuan
beyond 2020. Thus, water recycling, including use of treated water for agricultural
or secondary purposes, and application of wastewater for agricultural irrigation
should be encouraged to reduce the need for new supplies.
(c) The WWTP project will bring new water to the Fen-l reservoir. This new water
will have to be treated before it is distributed for final uses.  The transport,
treatment and distribution of the new water from the Fen-] reservoir to the end
users will require additional investments. Even though treatment and distribution
are the responsibilities of the Taiyuan city, it is a goal of the WWTP project to
provide quality water to service the end users. Thus, additional costs associated
with treatment and distribution should be an integral part of the total WWTP
project, and should be properly financed.
(d) Increased urban and industrial activities will also result in increased wastewater
discharge back to the rivers. In order to maintain water quality in the rivers, the
discharges will have to be strictly controlled. Therefore, significant investments in
wastewater treatment will be essential to restore and maintain acceptable levels of
water quality in the Fen River. Wastewater treatment will also make reuse of
effluents possible and thus contribute to reducing demand for new water. Based
on the goal for the project, the cost for wastewater treatment should also be a part
of the overall WWTP project. Details of wastewater treatment are discussed in
Section 5.3, Water Pollution Control, of this Chapier.
5.2.2.3      System Improvements with WWTP
The water from the WWTP project would add about 1.76 million cubic meter (mcm) a
day to the Fen River to service the city of Taiyuan. The existing Fen-1 reservoir will
contain and regulate the water to meet the Taiyuan city water demand. The new water
will require treatment before it can be used for intended industrial and urban uses. The
city will also have to provide additional intake and transport lines, and expanded
distribution networks for the new water.
In 1995, the Taiyuan Water Supply Company prepared a two-phase plan to transport,
treat, and distribute an additional total of 1.76 million cubic meters (mcm) per day or
640 mcm/yr of new water from the Fen-l reservoir in two stages (154). Stage one
would have involved delivery of I mcm/d of water, and Stage two, the delivery of the
remaining 0.76 mcmld of water. The water will be transported from Fen- I reservoir to
the treatment plant located at the Huyan village in the north suburbs of Taiyuan city.
5.2.2.3.1   Huyan Treatment Plant
In Fen-l reservoir the imported water will mix with local water. The quality of water
to go from the reservoir via the Cws will be an excellent raw water supply for
5-7



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final Report
municipallindustrial use, but the water will have to be treated to remove turbidity
including bacteria and viruses. This will be deal by the Huyan treatment plant.
The Huyan treatment plant for Stage I will have a capacity of 365 mcm/yr. The
proposed treatment process is conventional rapid sand filter plant and will include a
pre-settling tank, a flocculation tank, rapid sand filters, a backwash tank, and a final
treated water holding tank where disinfectants are added. Figure 5.2.2-1 shows the
schematic of the Huyan water treatment plant. The treated water will then be pumped
to the new distribution network.
5.2.2.3.2    Distribution System Expansion
The Taiyuan Water Supply Company proposes to replace most of its trunk main
system because of undersizing and age as part of infrastructure development associated
with the new water from WWTP. The new system would also reduce water leakage.
Approximately 300 km of the pipes will be replaced. In addition, two new pumping
stations and associated new pipework are proposed with capacities of 50,000 cm/d and
100,000 cm/d each to provide additional water to the east and west areas of the city.
The proposed new distribution system is shown in Figure 5.2.2-2.
5.2.2.3.3    Pricing, Cost Recovery and Financing
The Taiyuan Water Supply Company has prepared a cost estimate for transmitting the
new water from Fen-1 reservoir to the new Huyan treatment plant, for treating the
water in the new treatment plant, and for distributing it to customers through an
expanded distribution network (154). The system is designed to treat 365 mcm a year
(57%) in the Stage 1, and treat the remaining 275 mcm/yr in Stage 2. The cost
breakdown for the proposed water treatment plant and distribution system to serve
Taiyuan city is shown in Table 5.2.2-11.
The company proposes to raise the funding through domestic and international funds
primary from Japanese and Korean banks. The company plans to recover the cost
through pricing and pay back the loan by Year 2027. Detailed financial analysis can be
found elsewhere (146).
Pricing of the surface water as well as existing groundwater should consider factors
including cost recovery for paying back the loan, and operating and maintaining the
water supply system, and other related expenses. However, the pricing system should
also consider pricing to encourage water conservation, water reuse for industrial
purposes, and discourage wastage, use, and overpumping of groundwater, especially
on industries having their own wells.
5.2.3       Water Quality Monitoring
Currently, Taiyuan has 10 surface water monitoring stations along the Fen River from
Fen-I Reservoir to Xiao Dian, and 6 stations are located in Taiyuan. River water
samples are collected three times a year during May, August and October. Water
samples are analyzed for 37 constituents including COD, BOD, DO, heavy metals and
toxic organics.
5-8



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Project                                 Final Report
The City Environmental Protection Bureau has developed a plan to add additional 6
monitoring stations in the same stretch of Fen River to cover more areas where heavy
municipal and industrial wastewater discharge. In addition, sampling frequency is to
be increased from 3 to 6 times a year, and the analyses done on 65 parameters
including radionucleolides and PCB.
The plan developed by City EPB may not be sufficient to address all aspects of water
supply and quality monitoring. The plan for water supply monitoring will be modified
as needed include the following:
(a)    Water amounts used for residences, commercial buildings, public buildings,
industries, and agriculture.
(b)   Adequacy of water supply for (a) (present and future).
(c)    Quality of supply for (a) including quarterly sampling and analyses and series of
stations (estimated total of about 100) using parameters indicating adequacy
for drinking purposes.  These include turbidity, total dissolved solids,
coliforms, pH and alkalinity, major cations and major anions, iron and
manganese, and color.
(d)   Adequacy of quality for (a).
(e)    Recommendation for needed improvements (technical and institutional).
The water quality monitoring will comprise the following activities:
(a)    This includes (i) quarterly sampling of quality of imported water at series of
stations along the GML, SML, and Connection Works (total of about 20
stations), (ii) analysis as shown in (c) above, plus eutrophication parameters
(nitrogen and phosphorus form) and gross toxicity; (iii) evaluation of these data
to determine any evidences of unacceptable quality degradation; and (iv)
explanation of these; and (v) recommendations for needed improvements, and
(vi) annual evaluation of adequacy of monitoring program with
recommendations for needed improvements.
(b)   Quarterly sampling of quality of existing surface waters, using a series of
stations (total of about 20); analysis of these for Class III parameters;
evaluation of data to determine any conditions of unacceptability with
recommendations for improvements in controlling pollution discharges. Also
annual sampling of bottom sediments in streams (selected few stations) with
analyses for detecting accumulation of toxic substances. Annual review and
improvements of monitoring program.
(c)    Annual sampling of quality of groundwaters which are utilized for water
supply, including parameters for drinking water purposes, using series of
stations (say 20 total); evaluation of data to detect evidences of unacceptability
with recommendations for needed improvements, and annual review and
improvement; in monitoring program.
5.2.4        Costs/Benefits of WWTP
5-9



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final Report
Evaluation of the costs/benefits of the WWTP project must include consideration of
environmental, social, and economic factors. Environmental factors may include both
positive and negative impacts on water quality, hydrology, forests, wildlife and
fisheries. The social factors relate to the quality of life and living standards and
conditions. For example, the project may affect public health, recreation, and the level
of environmental pollution. The economic factors are associated with community and
industrial development. The major benefits anticipated for this project are primarily
social and economic (i.e. improvement of living standards, and urban and industrial
development for the target areas).
The current shortage of water has already created serious economic stress in the
region. The estimates of the losses attributable to water shortages for the Taiyuan city
for 1993 alone are over RMB 2.24 billion (146).
The above estimates do not include indirect costs associated with deterioration of the
quality of life and living standards that result from the water shortage. For example,
when compared to the rest of the country, the average water use per capita is among
the lowest iri the nation.  In some cases, wastewater has been used directly for
agriculture and has created a public health problem due to the accumulation of metals
in produce. Ground subsidence as a result of over pumping groundwater is also a
serious problem throughout the area.
The forecast for the water balance for the next 25 years also shows that, without the
WWTP project, the three areas will experience little or no growth in urban and
industrial activity due to a shortage of water. The possible impact of limited urban and
industrial growth on the region will include a declining quality of life, an increase in
environmental pollution, and underuse of land, energy and metal resources in the area.
The city has virtually no alternatives to the Yellow River for obtaining additional
water to support growth and to improve the quality of life. Other potential water
sources such as Yangtse River and other rivers and lakes are much further away and
more costly to develop than the Yellow River. In addition, the cities are already
recycling 85 to 88 % of the water and, consequently, additional recycling can only
have limited effect.
The investment for the WWWTP project is estimated at a total of about RMB 12.6
billion needed for the first phase that includes GTL, STL the connection work to link
the Fen-I Reservoir to the water treatment plant, and the treatment and distribution
network in Taiyuan. Even if the investment were made today, the return on investment
considering just the loss in revenues resulting from having too little water, looks very
favorable. Overall, the potential social and economic impacts of the WWTP project on
the region are very positive.  The WWTP project may have some negative
environmental impacts on water quality -and the ecology; some resettlement may also
be necessary.  Nevertheless, these potential impacts should be manageable and
mitigation measures are being proposed, as presented and discussed elsewhere in this
report. In summary, it appears that the econoniic benefits will outweigh the costs of
the WWTP project.
5.2.5 Summary and Conclusions
5-10



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                  Final Report
(a) The water demand, supply, and balance for Taiyuan indicate that water is currently
in short supply (overdraft of 89 million cubic meters of groundwater in 1993). The
forecasts of water demand, supply and balance with and without the WWTP
project for the years 2002, 2010, and 2020 are shown in Table 5.2.2-10. The
forecasts indicate an increasingly serious shortage of water unless the WWTP
project is implemented. This projected shortage is expected to drastically impact
the quality of life, worsen living conditions and limit urban and industrial growth in
the area. With the WWTP project, the areas will have adequate water supplies to
meet demand until the year 2020 and beyond, provided that water recycling and
wastewater reuse are practiced.
(b) The WWTP project will bring new water to the city to augment the existing water
supply. The new water will have to be treated before distribution for final uses and
this treatment and additional distribution facilities will require additional
investment. Costs for treatment and distribution, therefore, should be a part of the
WWTP and properly financed. Cost estimates to cover the additional water
treatment and distribution for Taiyuan are in the RMB 2.34 billion range.
(c) The costs/benefits of the WWTP project appear to be very positive based on
economic, and socialUenvironmental considerations.  Social conditions, which
include the quality of life and encompass public health, recreation, and pollution,
should generally improve with the project. The economic factors, which are the
primary driving force for the W'WTP project, appear to be very favorable. For
example, the loss of revenues which can be attributed to the shortage of water is
estimated at over RMB 2.24 billion for Taiyuan for 1993 alone, while the
investment required for the \WWTP is about RMB 12.6 billion over the next 10
years.
(d) The increased urban and industrial activities that will result from the provision of
new water will also result in increased wastewater discharge back to the rivers. In
order to maintain the quality of the river water supply, the discharges will have to
be strictly controlled. Consequently, an investment in wastewater treatment will be
essential to restore and maintain an acceptable level of water quality in the Fen
River. Wastewater treatment will also make possible the reuse of treated effluents
and conserve new water.
5.3          WATER POLLUTION CONTROL
5.3.1        Introduction
The availability of additional water will generate new and increased industrial and
urban wastewater discharges that will contain a variety of pollutants. Treatment of
these wastewaters will be essential to reduce the pollution load to the river system in
order to maintain water quality in the river, and to minimize the overall impact to the
environment. If river water quality deteriorates, a higher and more costly level of
treatment will be necessary; if the deterioration is significant, the cost may become
prohibitive. Therefore, wastewater management is essential to minimize the potential
5-1 1



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                  Final Repor
impact. Wastewater management will also promote the reuse of treated effluent.
Water recycling and wastewater reuse should be encouraged and optimized to reduce
new water requirements.
The following sections will assess current wastewater treatment and disposal practices,
forecast. future wastewater quantity, and discuss future treatment and disposal
requirements for Taiyuan. The implementation of a strategy to ensure that wastewaters
will not be discharged to the river without control is also described.
5.3.2        Existing Situation
5.3.2.1      Taiyuan Sewerage System
Taiyuan discharges its treated, partially treated or untreated municipal and industrial
wastewater into the Fen River, into the irrigation channels running parallel to the river,
or into Fen River tributaries. Most industries discharge their wastewater into the
municipal wastewater system, while some large industrial plants own and operate their
own treatment plants. Portions of treated and untreated wastewater are recycled for
irrigation and limited industrial reuse. A process schematic illustrating the wastewater
system for Taiyuan is shown in Figure 5.3.2-1.
5.3.2.1.1    City Zoning for Sewerage
Currently Taiyuan has fifteen (15) defined sewerage drainage areas, an increase from
eight (107) last year in preparation for additional wastewater from the diversion.
Figure 5.3.2-2 shows the IS drainage areas in Taiyuan. Table 5.3.2-1 shows the name,
the service area covered and the wastewater flow for these 15 drainage areas. Most
areas have separate stormwater and sanitary sewers, but the older, downtown area has
a combined system. The major drainage areas are:
*  Shang Lan, a small area (2.5 km2) to the north of the main city mainly serving the
paper mnill and associated housing;
*  Bel Jiao, in the north east of the city with a service area of 23 km2, which serves
the Jing Yang and Xin Yang chemical works and associated populations;
*  The steel mill industrial and housing area (26 km2) in the north east of the city;
*  Yang Jia Bao, the main downtown area (34 kM2) on the east bank;
*  Nan Jiao, the largely industrial area (23 kIM2) in the south east of the city;
  Hexi Xi North, the west bank of the city, northern area (21 kM2);
*  Hexi Xi Central, the west bank of the city, central area (10 kM2);
* Nan Yan, the area (20 kin2) in the south west of the city, mainly serving the
Taiyuan Chemical Company's factories and the No. 2 Power Plant.

Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project                                 Final Report
5.3.2.1.2    Wastewater Sources
Wastewater discharges in the main urban area of Taiyuan were estimated in 1993 to be
around 220 mcm, or 600,000 cm/d (107), of which around half was of industria]
origin. The wastewater volume .s about 237 mcm, or 650,000 cmld for 1995. The
breakdown of the wastewater sources in 1995 are:
Wastewater Source         Flow, cm/d
Domestic                  200,000
Municipal                 100,000
Industrial                300,000
Total                     650,000
Most of this wastewater is discharged to the Fen River, either through sewers or open
ditches and tributaries. Only about 125,000 cmld of wastewater or 19% is currently
being treated prior to discharge. Seventeen major enterprises contribute about 83% of
the industrial volume, the largest being the steel mill, the fertilizer plant, the two power
stations, the chemicals plant and the paper mill (Table 5.3.2-2).
Table 5.3.2-1 shows the wastewater flows by drainage areas. Yang Jin Bao drainage
area, which serves the downtown area, generates 36% of the total wastewater volume
alone.
5.3.2.1.3    Sewer Collecting System
Current sewer collecting system totals 255 miles within 9 different drainage systems,
and is incomplete in many areas. In some cases, e.g. the Yao Jia Bao area, sewer lines
are limiting the wastewater treatment capacity because wastewater can not be collected
and delivered to the treatment plant.
5.3.2.1.4    Treatment Facilities
There are three municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), all on the east side
of the river: Bei Jiao in the north, Yang Jia Bao serving the central downtown area,
and Ying Jia Bao in the south. In addition, there are two plants serving industries and
their surrounding areas: Zhao Zhuang, serving Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company on
the east side of the river, and Nan Yan serving the chemical complex on the west side.
The location of the existing treatment plants is shown in Figure 5.3.2-3. Key data are
summarized in Table 5.3.2-3.
(a)   Bei Jiao
The treatment plant at Bei Jiao is a modern activated sludge plant. The process
schematic is shown in Figure 5.3.2-4. Although there are four sludge digesters, these
are not in use and the sludge is passed to drying beds where it is removed by farmers
for fertilizer. Untreated sewage is also taken by farmers in the irrigation season for
5-13



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Project                                  Final ReRnor
direct application to fields. At other times, treated effluent is used by the steel mills for
cooling water (1.4 mcm in 1994). The drainage area contains mainly chemical plants
which have some pretreatment capability.
(b)   Yang Jia Bao
This is the largest treatment plant in Taiyuan with a design capacity of 166,400m;/d
serving the central city area, which is almost totally developed. The process schematic
of this secondary treatment facility is shown in Figure 5.3.2-5. It is well maintained
and constructed, but due to limited sewer connections, the actual flow is only around
60,000 m3/d. Sludge is currently dried on beds and this too is reported to be a
limitation on throughput of the plant. Plans for new sludge processing facilities have
been prepared, and it is understood that funds for building these have been allocated
for 1997. Part of the effluent is used by local farmers for irrigation.
(c)    Ying Jia Bao
The third municipal treatment plant receives flows of 15,000m3/d which are 80%
industrial. Although it was designed to be a secondary treatment plant, only primary is
built and operational. Figure 5.3.2-6 shows the process schematic for the plant. The
design flow is 29,000m3/d; some capacity is unused because sewer connections have
not been made and there are no funds for their construction.
(d)   Zhao Zhang
Zhao Zhang serves the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company area and is operated and
maintained by the Company. The plant employs chemical coagulation and dissolved air
flotation for treatment, and the process schematic is shown in Figure 5.3.2-7. The
capacity of the works is 80,000m3/d and the works is reported to operate at full
capacity. A further 20,000m3/d from smaller industries in the drainage areas passes
directly to the river.
(e)   Nan Yan
Nan Yan is operated by the Taiyuan Municipal Chemical Company which owns most
of the 21 facilities served by the treatment plant. It is an activated sludge plant with an
original design capacity of I 00,000m3/d, now assessed to be 60,000m3/d because of
process limitations. The process schematic is shown in Figure 5.3.2-8. It currently
treats 20,000m3/d, because several of the factories which are meant to discharge to it
are unable to achieve effluent standards, and thus discharge direct to the river instead.
The wastewater has a high COD, low BOD, and negligible heavy metals.
Overall, the operation and maintenance-of these treatment plants are not at their best,
many plants are not meeting discharge standards due to lack of adequate monitoring
and enforcement.
5.3.2.2      Recycling and reuse
5-14



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                 Final Report
Untreated municipal wastewater as well as treated wastewater from three municipal
wastewater treatment plants is being used for irrigation use. However, untreated
wastewater is generally preferred by the farmer since it is usually free while a few
would usually be charged for using service treatment plant effluent.
The effluent from the Zhao Zhang industrial wastewater treatment plant is completely
recycled and used by the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company.
5.3.2.3      Solid Wastes Impact on Water Quality
Existing municipal and some industrial solid wastes are currently disposed in
uncontrolled areas along the bank of Fen River and its tributaries. With this practice,
the potential for river contamination by landfill leachates and surface runoff is very
high. In addition, presumably there are no sanitary landfills which have liners and caps
in Taiyuan. Some industrial wastes are toxic/hazardous, and uncontrolled disposal may
pose serious short and/or long term health and environmental exposure risks.
5.3.2.4     Institutional Control and Permit System
The operation and maintenance of WVWTPs is carried out by the Drainage Management
Section of the Urban Engineering Management Bureau, while the maintenance of
sewers is the responsibility of the Municipal Engineering Management Section of the
Bureau, which also has responsibility for roads, bridges, streetlights, etc. The latter
organization has area based management units, with separate roads and sewer crews in
each.
All wastewater treatment plants and most sewers are designed by the Taiyuan
Municipal Engineering Design Institute (TMEDI). However, this institute only takes
schemes to the detailed drawings stage: completion of tender documents and all
subsequent stages of implementation are dealt with by an investment institute under the
Planning Commission. Public rest rooms and the disposal of nightsoil are managed by
the Sanitation Bureau, and the Environmental Protection Bureau is responsible for
monitoring discharges to the environment and for collecting discharge or surcharge
fees based by volume and concentration, and fines.
5.3.2.5      Financing/Pricing
The fees for sewerage services are as follows:
Service                         Fee, RMB/cm
Government Institutions         0.1
Industry                        0.12
Domestic Connections            no charge
These fees are collected by the Water Conservation Office and an additional charge of
RMB 0.05/cm is collected by the City Environmental Protection Bureau. In addition,
5-15



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                  Final Report
when the effluent standards to the sewer are not met from industrial facilities, a fine is
collected by TEPB. The charges range from RMB 0.2/cm to 0.4/cm.
5.3.3        Plans for Future
As pointed out in this Chapter earlier, the key environmental issue for the project is the
potential water pollution implications arising from the transfer of additional, clean
water from the Yellow River to Taiyuan where a significant portion of it will become
wastewater. This wastewater should not be discharged to the Fen River without
suitable treatment. It is imperative to forecast the future wastewater volume and
develop protective measures such as treatment and reuse of wastewater to manage the
impacts to the River system.
5.3.3.1      Wastewater Flow Forecast
To estimate the potential wastewater flows from various sources or sectors, a water
balance is needed that considers various factors affecting the flow. A flow diagram for
estimating the wastewater is shown in Figure 5.3.3-1. As can been seen from the
diagram, the total wastewater flow forecast requires separate forecasts for the
municipal, agricultural and industrial sectors as well as irrigation and system losses
associated with domestic use. The following sections discuss the wastewater forecasts
for Taiyuan City.
5.3.3.1.1    Municipal Wastewater Forecast:
Municipal wastewater forecast is generally based on the municipal water demand
forecast. Forecasting of domestic water demand is based on population projections
and per capita consumption rates, and has been developed and discussed in Section
5.2.2.1 in this Chapter.
All water that is used for municipal purposes does not become wastewater. For
example, irrigation water usually does not contribute to wastewater flow because it
does not reach the sewer system. In addition, water is lost from the municipal
distribution system due to leakage from transmission lines and household taps, and by
spillage onto the ground and watering of lawns/gardens.  These losses typically
account for 20 % of the municipaUdomestic water use. Wastewater flow forecasts for
years 2002, 2010, and 2020 for Taiyuan are shown in Table 5.3.3-1. These forecasts
were calculated by subtracting the irrigation and system use losses from the total
demand and multiplying the domestic use by 0.8.
5.3.3.1.2    Industrial Wastewater Forecast
Industrial water demand forecasts have been developed in Section 5.2.2.1 of this
Chapter, and the data can be used to forecast the wastewater volume. The proportion
of water use that becomes wastewater is different for each industry. The percentages
of water usage that is discharged as wastewater for each of the five industrial groups in
Taiyuan have been estimated from data developed previously for Taiyuan (201), and
are shown in Tables 5.3.3-2 and 5.3.3-3. Based on these wastewater generation
percentages, industrial wastewater projections were developed for each industrial
5-16



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                 Final Revoo
group for the years 2002, 2010, and 2020. The results are also presented in Table
5.3.3-1.
5.3.3.1.3    Agricultural Wastewater Forecast
From the wastewater treatment and pollution control point of view, all water allocated
to the agricultural sector can be treated as a total loss to Taiyuan since any water
return is to the river downstream of Taiyuan.
5.3.3.1.4    Total Wastewater Forecast
The total wastewater forecasts for Taiyuan for years 2002, 201 0, and 2020 are shown
in Table 5.3.3-1. A spreadsheet showing the calculations from water demand forecast
to wastewater flow predictions is attached here as Table 5.3.3-4.
5.3.3.2      Wastewater Forecast for Drainage Areas
The Taiyuan City is now divided into 15 sewerage drainage areas in anticipation of
WWTP. Based on the current and forecasted population and industry development,
wastewater forecast for each drainage area has been developed by Taiyuan Municipal
Engineering Design Institute (TMEDI) in June 15, 1996 and is shown in Table 5.3.3-5
(162). The numbers in Table 5.3.3-5 are essentially the same as the ones in Table
5.3.3-4, which were estimated from data developed by Tianjin Survey and Design
Institute. Wastewater forecasts by the drainage areas are shown in Table 5.3.3-6.
5.3.3.3      Proposed Improvements on Sewer Collection System
Wastewater treatment involves collection and discharge in addition to the actual
treatment process. The sewer system is essential to ensure that wastewater is collected
for treatment and not discharged directly to the environment. The cost of a sewer
system is usually high because it is typically underground.
Based on the plan developed by TEMPI, the following sewer lines has been planned to
be built and added to the existing sewer collection system for the three target years:

The sewer expansion plan was developed based on the treatment requirement
projections over these three target years.

Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final Revort
One of the major goals of the WWTP project is to restore and protect water quality in
the river. Achievement of the goal may.require treatment to a level suitable for reuse
such as recycling and groundwater recharge as well as for direct discharge of
wastewater generated. However, because of the large investment required, treatment
of all wastewater will not be possible for some period of time. To minimize impacts on
the river during this interim period, a comprehensive phased program should be
developed and implemented to optimize wastewater treatment and promote water
reuse.
Treatment facilities for combined municipal and industrial wastewater generally can be
categorized as primary, secondary, or tertiary. A primary treatment plant usually only
includes preliminary treatment such as screening and grit removal, and primary settling
in tanks to remove suspended solids and flotables. A secondary treatment plant adds a
biological treatment process to remove suspended organic matter in the wastewater.
Usually, secondary treatment is sufficient to meet most river discharge standards.
However, for certain receiving water bodies which can only accept a very high quality
water or for some types of industrial water reuse, tertiary treatment processes, such as
nitrogen, phosphorus, or trace toxic organic removal, may be required in order to meet
discharge standards.
Stabilization ponds is a cost effective way of treating wastewater where land is
available, which could reduce the cost of treatment for Taiyuan. These ponds could be
built inside tributaries and along the banks of Fen River to treat wastewater before
entering the River. For example, there are 6 tributaries which receive about 420,000
cm/d of municipal wastewater which could be used as stabilization ponds. However,
only the far end of tributaries would receive adequate treatment (i.e. have enough
retention time). Therefore, stabilization ponds along the Fen river are also required to
ensure adequate treatment of tributary wastewater. A minimum detention time of
about 25 days is usually required to provide adequate treatment.
The drawbacks of using stabilization ponds inside the tributaries and along the Fen
River, instead of treatment plants, include (i) during storms the high river bed could
wipe out the stabilization ponds, and (ii) the treatment efficiency is not as high as
conventional secondary treatment because of algal growth in the ponds. In addition, a
future plan to build an inflatable dam to dam up Fen river in the city would cover up
the areas proposed for the ponds. As a result, TMEDI considers pond treatment as
transitional and temporary, and will be phased out by year 2020 and at that time, all
wastewater would be treated by the treatment plants.
Based on the wastewater flow forecasts, TMEDI (162) has proposed to add
wastewater treatment capacities according to the wastewater flow prediction. Table
5.3.3-7 summarizes the plan for increasing the treatment plant capacity for each target
year. Details of the proposed plan for each drainage area are shown in Table 5.3.3-8.
The plan basically assumes a phased approach to build collection and treatment
capacities and all wastewater in Taiyuan would be collected and treated by 2020.
During the interim periods in 2002 and 2010, stabilization ponds would be used to
provide additional treatment of wastewater to achieve 100 % treatment capacity during
these two target years. Pond treatment would account for 40 % of the treatment in
5-18

2002 and 26 % in 2010, and would be phased out completely as new sewers and
treatment plants are built in 2020. The plan is summarized in the following table:

* Adapted from Table 5.3.3-6
The wastewater generated by a treatment facility may be reused for agricultural or
farm irrigation, city irrigation for green belts, and industrial production such as cooling,
provided that it meets water reuse standards. Crop contamination by heavy metals
following agricultural irrigation with untreated wastewater has been reported in a
number of areas. For irrigation, primary treatment may be sufficient to meet reuse
standards for certain types of crops (but not trees), but for city irrigation or industrial
use, secondary treatment followed by disinfection may be necessary. In the plan
presented by TMEDI, the degree of treatment would depend on the final use of the
treated water. For example, in 2020, 51 % of wastewater would be treated by primary
treatment for irrigation and limited industrial reuse, 41 % by secondary treatment for
industrial recycling and 8 % by tertiary treatment for certain special industrial uses.
5.3.3.5      Recycling and Reuse
Wastewater can be reused for industrial production, irrigation, groundwater
recharging, and other purposes, provided that it is treated to meet applicable standards.
For land irrigation, primary treatment may be sufficient to meet the standards, but for
agricultural or industrial use and for direct discharge into the river, secondary
treatment may be necessary. Therefore, even limited wastewAater treatment such as
primary treatment could generate effluents which reduce impact on the river and
alleviate the current water shortage problem. Revenues from sale of the treated
effluent could contribute to the development of wastewater treatment capacity. A
comprehensive program will have to be developed to address recycling and reuse
issues to ensure optimal use of water.
5.3.3.6      Future Dispersion Policy
Tayuan city is planning to disperse industry away from the city to the north and
southeast into "industrial parks", so that industrial pretreatment plants can be set up to
pretreat wastewater before they are discharged into river.   From  the wvaste
5-19



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Project                                 Final Report
management point of view, this practice would simplify wastewater management
significantly and ensure proper collection and treatment. In addition, the cost of
wastewater treatment would be less since the treatment plant would be treating a
highly concentrated waste stream.  However, moving existing industries from
downtown to industrial parks may be costly.
5.3.3.7      Solid Wastes Impact on Water Quality
The WWTP project will result in the generation of additional municipal and industrial
solid wastes which will impact the environment if not properly managed. It is
imperative that sanitary landfills which have liners and caps to contain the wastes and
leachate, will be available to receive these wastes. Disposal in uncontrolled solid waste
dumps will eventually result in surface runoff and leaching of pollutants and
contamination of Fen River as well as groundwater resources. Some hazardous sludge
may require treatment, such as chemical stabilization or incineration, to reduce
toxicity prior to final land disposal.
5.3.3.8      Cost and Financing Including Revolving Fund Loan
Based on the plan developed by TMEDI as shown in Table 5.3.3-8, the costs for
building the collection and treatment systems have been estimated and are shown in
Table 5.3.3-9 for each target year. The total investment for treating all wastewater by
2020 for the city of Taiyuan is estimated at RMB 2.8 billion.
Considering the size of the investment, a cost recovery approach should be developed
as part of the overall water and wastewater management plan to address the short term
and long term needs for treatment and reuse and protect river water quality. The
treatment costs could be borne by the wastewater generators under a "generator pays"
concept. In addition, a revolving fund loan for cleaner technology should be set up to
develop new and more efficient wastewater treatment technologies for more cost
effective applications in the future.
Two of the most cost-effective ways for wastewater management are pollution
prevention and development of sustainable, cleaner technologies to reduce waste and
improve efficiency. City EPB has proposed a plan to approach pollution prevention
and develop clean technology. The Bureau has proposed to support financially 2 to 3
major wastewater generators including Taiyuan Iron and Steel and Taiyuan Chemical
Company to develop pollution prevention programs and develop or import cleaner
technologies using a low interest revolving fund loan. The money will be paid back to
the lending agency after the programs has been developed say after 2 to 3 years, and
will be loaned to other facilities or industries. The proposed budget is about RMB 8
million.
5.3.3.9      Environmental Monitoring
Environmental monitoring is carried out by the Monitoring Division of Taiyuan City
EPB. The Division has about 90 people including 60 engineers, and over 450
5-20



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Project                                  Final Repon
monitonng devices and analytical equipment. The equipment includes AA, GC,
Infrared Spectroscopy and Fluorescent Spectroscopy.
Environmental monitoring for wastewater discharge concentrates in the City of
Taiyuan. Monitoring of wastewater flow and concentrations is done on 39 industrial
facilities once a month. Monitoring parameters vary with the types of industries.
Basically, industries are required to monitor their own wastewater or effluent and
report routinely to City EPB for permit compliance. City EPB performs water quality
monitoring for Fen River and its tributaries, inspects treatment plant operations and
conducts random sampling of effluents periodically. However, it is our understanding
that monitoring by City EPB is inadequate and poor, and analytical equipment is scarce
making effective control difficult.
City EPB has a plan to increase monitoring for more industrial facilities, and to
implement continuous monitoring stations at major industrial facilities including
Taiyuan Iron and Steel, Taiyuan Fertilizer Plant, Taiyuan Pulp and Paper Plant, and
Taiyuan Chemical Plant. The plan may still be inadequate since it does not cover all
industrial plants. It only cover major industries. A comprehensive plan will have to be
developed for the city.
A comprehensive waste management and water pollution control monitoring program
to be developed by the proposed integrated water use agency (Taiyuan Water
Enterprise Holding Company), will include the following components:
(a)   Review of existing wastewater treatment facilities for both communities and
industries operating under the Permit System. This includes evaluation of their
adequacy for furnishing pollution control and recommendations for needed
improvements.
(b)   Review of existing solid waste management facilities (to be included in the
Permit System) for both communities and industries; evaluation of their
adequacy for pollution control and recommendation for needed improvements.
(d)   Review of agricultural practices in ESA related to water pollution with
recommendations for improvement including use of Fen River water for
irrigation and associated provisions for protection against health hazards.
(e)   Review of all uses of treated sewage effluents as supplemental water supply,
for compliance with meeting water quality standards for these uses
5.3.3.10     Environmental Training
Environmental training on water pollution control should at least include the following
areas:
(a) Optimal use of water including balancing groundwater, surface water and treated
water for best industrial, municipal and agricultural applications.
(b) Municipal and industrial wastewater treatment management and technologies for
controlled discharges and for water reuse.

(d) Environmental monitoring on water quality and effluent discharge
(e) Permit systems and enforcement to protect river quality and environment
(f) New, efficient and cleaner technologies for pollution prevention and waste
minimization
5.3.3.11    Institutional Control
An effective way to control discharges to a river system is by the establishment of a
regulatory and implementation agency that would develop and implement a discharge
permit system similar to the one currently in place in the US. This agency would
perform functions which are currently being conducted by various governmental
agencies including Provincial and City Environmental Protection Bureaus (PBS) and
Provincial Water Conservancy Bureaus (WCB), Taiyuan Urban Construction
Committee (TUCC), and the Yellow River Diversion Project office (YRDP). Each of
these agencies is currently concemed with water use and distribution, waste
management and water pollution control to promote optimal use of water in only a
part of the service area. Details of the proposed agency is discussed in Section 5.5.3
of this Chapter.
As discussed previously, potential environmental impacts can be diminished by water
recycling and wastewater reuse because these practices can significantly reduce fresh
water usage, and leverage the use of new water to meet future demand. One way to
encourage water recycling and treated effluent reuse is by pricing such that water use
will reflect return on investment. For example, industries generally generate high
retums on investment, and, thus, can afford a higher water price. If the price of water
is high, but not high enough to be cost prohibitive or non-competitive, then water will
be preferentially used by industrial plants.  This pricing policy must encourage
recycling, especially by industry, and the use of lower cost treated effluent for low
return operations such as irrigation. Regulations would limit the use of wastewater or
treated effluent for only certain applications since uses such as domestic uses require
water of high quality for health and other reasons.
5.3.3.12    Permit System for Wastewater Discharges
Currently, Taiyuan EPB has issued wastewater discharge permits to 36 major
industries for discharge into the treatment plants and for direct discharge into Fen
river. These 36 industries account for 85% of the total industrial flow. As discussed
in Environmental Monitoring, industries' are required to monitor their own wastewater
or effluent and report routinely to City EPB for permit compliance.  City EPB
performs water quality monitoring for Fen River and its tributaries, inspects treatment
plant operations and conducts random sampling of effluents periodically. However, it
is our understanding that monitoring by City EPB is inadequate and poor, and
analytical equipment is scarce making effective control difficult.

Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                  Final Reort
City has a plan is to issue permits to over 100 plants, install continuous monitoring
system at major wastewater dischargers, and purchase new analytical equipment for
their lab, in anticipation of the WWTP project. The target of permitting 100 plants is
to cover over 95 % of the industries which are still inadequate in controlling
wastewater discharges. In addition, effective monitoring and enforcement are the keys
to the success of the permiit program, and a detailed enforcement plan such as fines and
penalties has yet to be developed.
The proposed Permit System will involve the following elements:
(a) Establishment of appropriate design criteria including (i) discharge criteria based
on national minimum standards and local environmental requirements, (ii) for
industries, requirements for in-plant water reuse and use of clean technologies, and
(iii) requirements for periodic monitoring to be carried out by the discharger.
(b) Submitted by the discharging agency of its plan for meeting Item (a), for review
and approval by the Permit Agency.
(c) Issuance of permits to enable industrial facilities and municipal treatment plants to
discharge their wastewater upon meeting the regulations specified in (a) (b).
(d) Review of periodic monitoring results submitted say by the dischargers, plus
periodic checking by the Permit Agency of the adequacy of the monitoring.
(e) Where the discharger is not meeting requirements, application of enforcement
proceedings, including both legal actions and physical actions as appropriate.
The monitoring program will include periodic review of the adequacy of the
management of the permit system elements as noted above, and preparation of
appropriate recommendations for needed improvements.
5.3.4 Summary and Conclusions
(a) The WWTP project will generate wastewater that will have to be managed,
along with existing wastewaters, so that environmental pollution impacts are
properly controlled and managed. The increased wastewater volumes that will
result from new water have been forecasted for the years 2002, 2010, and 2020
for Taiyuan (1 14 104 m3/d for 2002, 156 for 2010, and 207 for 2020). Since
the volumes of new wastewater will be very high, wastewater recycling and
wastewater treatment will be necessary to reduce the impact on water quality in
the river. The potential wastewater volumes which may be recycled for
agricultural/farm irrigation and industrial uses have been estimated.
Assuming that primary treatment is required for agricultural reuse, secondary
treatment is required for discharge and for agricultural and industrial reuse,
Taiyuan MEDI has developed a plan to increase wastewater treatment
capabilities to almost 100 % for the target years. The plan is summarized in the
following:

* Adapted from Table 5.3.3-6
The plan calls for the use of stabilization ponds in the tributaries of Fen River
and along the banks of Fen River to provide additional polishing during 2002
and 2010 when wastewater collection and treatment plants are being built. The
target is to phase out stabilization ponds and have sufficient collection systems
and treatment plants by 2020. The cost estimates for treating wastewater
generated until the year 2020 for Taiyuan have been developed.  The
preliminary estimated treatment costs for the period until 2020 are about RMB
2.8 billion. These investments will be necessary in order to achieve the goal of
the WWTP project. Because of the size of the investment, the approach is to
use stabilization ponds as interim treatment while building the treatment
capacity in a phased approach over the next 25 years to optimize the
investment and still protect river quality.
(c) To ensure that industries and municipalities will treat their wastewater prior to
discharge, an area-wide regulatoryfimplementation agency will be established
to perform the functions currently being accomplished by several
governmental agencies with the following functions:
(c l)  Regulating water use to ensure optimal overall use of the limited
water supply, with priority to substitute use of treated effluent by
industries in place of using freshwater, and the use of treated effluents
for other reuse purposes including agricultural irrigation and
groundwater recharging, so that freshwater supplies are used for high
quality use purposes including community water supply, to be achieved
by establishing an appropriate pricing structure and by
monitoring/enforcement.
(c2)  Establishing appropriate standards for wastewater treatment and
for reuse of treated wastewater as water supply.
(c3)  Establishing a permit system which requires all industries which
produce significant wastes (liquid and solid) to buildloperate their own
treatment systems as needed to protect environment, for discharge both

to municipal sewers or directly to environment, and to conduct their
own monitoring program with periodic reports to the "Integrated
Agency".
(c4)  Establishing/maintaining an environmental monitoring program
for exercising surveillance on (c2), and on all other waste treatment
facilities, including sewage treatment plants and solid waste disposal
sites, and for ambient water quality monitoring, as needed for achieving
a comprehensive area wide monitoring program.
(d) The water pollution management system of Taiyuan City, as discussed above, is
indicated to be consistent with WB policies given in Reference 306, "Water
Supply, Sanitation, and Environmental Sustainability, the Financing Challege".
5.4          WATER QUALITY
5.4.1        Water Quality Parameters and Standards
The People's Republic of China (PRC) has established a number of water quality
standards aimed at protecting water resources.   These include the National
Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water, National Integrated Wastewater
Discharge Standards, and Wastewater Treatment Plant Effluent Discharge Standards
(201). Compliance with these standards will place constraints on implementation of
the WWTP, but will also minimize potential environmental impacts.
5.4.1.1      National Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water
To protect public health and welfare and to enhance the quality of water, the PRC
established the National Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water in June
1988 (201). In establishing these standards, consideration was given to the beneficial
uses and value of streams for public water supplies, propagation of fish and wildlife,
and recreation, as well as agricultural, industrial, and other legitimate uses. Five
classes were defined for surface waters as indicated in the attached Table 5.4.1 -1. The
standards for each class are summarized in Table 5.4.1-2.
According to the classifications in Table 5.4.1-1, surface water quality for water supply
purposes has to meet at least Class III standards; these standards are similar to those in
the USA. Thus, the quality of the new water from the diversion will have to achieve
Class III standards.
5.4.1.2      National Integrated Wastewater Discharge Standards
To protect environmental quality including water quality, the PRC also established
Integrated Wastewater Discharge Standards in June 1988. These standards were
based on maximum permissible limits for primary and secondary pollutants for three
classes of effluents. The classes established for these effluents are presented in Table
5.4.1-3, and the standards for each class are summarized in Table 5.4.1-4.
5-25



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Proiet                                 Final Report
As stated in Table 5.4.1-3, no new wastewater effluent is permitted to be discharged
into Class I and II waters and wastewater discharges into Class HI waters must meet
the appropriate standards listed in Table 5.4.1-4. This requirement will apply to the
increased wastewater discharges that will result from WWTP.
5.4.1.3     Wastewater Treatment Plant Effluent Discharge Standards
The National Bureau of Environmental Protection (NEPA) has established effluent
discharge standards for municipal wastewater treatment plants. These standards for
each class are summarized in Table 5.4.1-5.
5.4.2        Surface Water
The goal of the WWTP project is to deliver new water of sufficient quality for
distribution and final use. Major concerns with respect to the Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) for the WWTP project are whether the quality of the new water will
change during its passage from Wanjiazhai reservoir to Taiyuan, and whether new
water quality will be suitable to meet municipal and industrial needs.
Changes in water quality may not only occur as a result of transport through the
conveyance system to be built by the WWTP, but also due to increased wastewater
discharges along some of the river segments of the routes. The additional new water
supplied to the urban and industrial areas will result in a marked increase in the volume
of wastewater produced and this wastewater may either be discharged back to the river
or reused for various purposes. Treated effluent recycling can reduce the
environmental impact on the river through reduced discharge. Wastewater treatment
will reduce the pollutant load to the environment by removing contaminants from the
wastewater before its discharge.
5.4.2.1     Current Situation
The WWTP will divert water from the Yellow River to the Taiyuan city. The water to
be diverted to Taiyuan will pass through a tunnel system to the Fen River before it
reaches the existing Fen I reservoir. The Fen I reservoir will be the source for the
treatment plant that will serve Taiyuan city. Therefore, concerns about possible
deterioration of water quality for domestic and industrial uses are focused primarily on
the Yellow River at and upstream of the Wanjiazhai reservoir, the Fen River upstream
of Fen I reservoir, and the Fen I reservoir. However, the major concerns are the
deterioration of water quality in Fen river in Taiyuan where most wastewater will be
discharged due to increased urban and industrial activities.
5.4.2.1.1   Water Quality Upstream of Fen I Reservoir
The most recent studies of river water quality were carried out and reported by the
Chinese Radiation Protection Research Institute in 1994 (101,102,107). These three
reports represent a valuable "data bank" for the present studies and also contain useful
suggestions concerning potential protective measures.
(a)   Yellow River at Wanjiazhai
5-26



Waniiazhai NVater Transfer Proiect                                Final Report
Water quality in the Yellow River has been monitored at Wanjiazhai and the results are
reported in the Environmental Impact Statement for the South Main Line (102). Table
5.4.2-1 summarizes the analytical results for the study. In general, the quality is
adequate for water supply except for the four following constituents which exceed the
Class III Surface Water Standards (Table 5.4.1-2); soluble iron, total manganese,
COD and ammonia.
Analyses were not conducted for about ten Class m parameters, including copper,
zinc, nitrite, phosphate, selenium, oil and grease, and total bacteria. Consequently,
compliance with respect to these parameters cannot be evaluated. In particular, there
were no coliform analyses even though this parameter is considered one of the key
criteria for water quality assessment. The presence of high coliform counts typically
indicates discharge of untreated sewage of human/animal origin. Therefore, more data
are needed to evaluate water quality in the river fully and to assess whether there are
potential long term and/or short term health threats for users. However, the periodic
sampling and analysis results for the above 10 indicates conducted by Taiyuan Water
Supply Company indicates that this water will be an excellent raw water supply for
Taiyuan.
(b)   Fen River and the Fen I Reservoir
A long-term water quality monitoring program has been conducted in the Fen River
and its tributaries upstream of the Fen I reservoir (102). Analytical results for water at
the inlet to the Fen I reservoir, as well as Class III Surface Water Quality Standards,
are shown in Table 5.4.2-2; water quality at the inlet is similar to that in the Yellow
River. For most parameters, the standards are met but, similar to the Yellow River,
COD, ammonia, iron and manganese show exceedances, indicating that the water will
have to be treated to meet drinking water standards. Taiyuan city will transport water
from the Fen I reservoir to a new water treatment plant and then distribute the treated
water for final use. Use of the conventional rapid sand filtration process together with
effluent chlorination should meet this need.
An assessment of potential pollution sources upstream of the Fen I reservoir indicates
that there are industrial and agricultural discharges to the Fen River, although the
impact of these activities is not severely affecting river water quality. This may change
if new water becomes available and the volume of wastewater discharge increases.
5.4.2.1.2    Water Quality in Fen River in Taiyuan
Fen River in Taiyuan starts at Shang Lan and leaves Taiyuan at Xiao Dian, with a total
length of about 35 km. Figure 5.4.2-1 illustrates the Fen River in Taiyuan.
They are 17 tributaries which are used for municipal and industrial wastewater
discharge. Table 5.4.2-3 shows the water quality of 14 tributaries of Fen River in the
Taiyuan area. Many tributaries show very high concentrations of metals and organics.
The analytical data for wastewater from five major industrial sectors in Taiyuan are
shown in Table 5.4.2-4.
5-27



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiwt                                  Final Renort
The data provided by City EPB (June 1996) on Fen River water quality show that Fen
River deteriorates as it passes through the urban area. Table 5.4.2-5 through 5.4.2-7
show the water quality results at the 5 monitoring stations along Fen River for the low,
medium and high flow periods in 1995, respectively. The location of the monitoring
stations are also shown in Figure 5.4.2-1. The results of the key parameters are
summarized in Table 5.4.2-8.
The water quality results show significant deterioration of river water quality primarily
due to inadequate treatment and uncontrolled discharge of wastes. This is especially
serious during the low flow period, where COD increased from 33 mg/I at the Shang
Lan area to over 156 mg/l at Xiao Dian, an almost 5 fold increase. The increased
urban and industrial activities resulting from the new water supply will increase
wastewater discharges and further deteriorate the river quality, if the discharge is not
controlled. To restore and maintain river water quality, new treatment facilities for the
wastes generated from the use of new water will be required prior to discharge. In
addition, secondary reuse of water, such as application of domestic wastewater for
agricultural or landscape irrigation, should be practiced to optimize water usage and
this will minimize environmental impacts on the river.
5.4.2.2     Impact of WWTP on Water Quality
A complete assessment of water quality to the point of use must not only include the
source; the Wanjiazhai Reservoir, the Fen River and its tributaries, and the delivery
systen; tunnels, aqueducts, culverts, siphons and flumes, but the Fen I reservoir and
the water treatment and distribution systems in the city. Assessment should also be
done on the Fen River in Taiyuan where the major impact from increased wastewater
discharge would occur. The potential impact of each of these components is discussed
in the following sections.
5.4.2.2.1    Impact of Delivery System
(a)   Wanjiazhai Reservoir:
The Wanjiazhai reservoir will impound water from the Yellow River and flood low
land above the dam. The potential impact of a reservoir on water quality may include
the following:
(i) Temporary water pollution associated with construction activities and waste
disposal during dam construction. Care must be taken to minimize the impact.
(ii) Oxygen depletion in the water due to the decomposition of organic matter, such as
trees on the flooded land, that may result in fish kills. Also decomposition of
organics may cause nutrient enrichment and the production of undesirable
compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, methane and carbon dioxide. Some of these
gases may contribute to turbine corrosion and some are greenhouse gases.
Nutrient enrichment will also stimulate the growth of aquatic weeds, such as water
lettuce and water hyacinth, which can clog water intakes and increase water
treatment costs. Monitoring of the water quality in the reservoir can provide an
indication of the extent of these problems.
5-28



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Project                                  Final Reoort
(iii)The availability of water from the reservoir may result in locally increased
wastewater discharge and agricultural runoff back to the reservoir. Monitoring and
regulatory enforcement can limit the effects of these uncontrolled discharges to
maintain the water quality.
(iv)A reservoir acts as a sediment trap in a river. The diverted water from the
Wanjiazhai reservoir will have less sediment than the river, but levels are still
expected to be fairly high (in the I to 3 g/l range). As a result of the dam, there
will be less total sediment in the downstream segments of the Yellow River, but the
sediment in the diverted water may eventually impact components of the water
conveyance system such as the Fen River.
In addition to the possible water quality concerns sumnmarized above, uncontrolled
industrial and urban discharges upstream of the Wanjiazhai may also deteriorate future
water quality in the Yellow River and the reservoir.
(b)   Transmission System Including Tunnels and Other Conveyance Components
Since the tunnels and other conveyance components, such as inverted siphons,
culverts, and flumes, will all be enclosed, the potential for contamination is low.
Surface runoff will not have access to the system. The possibility of contamination
through infiltration is also low because most tunnels will be under pressure due to the
pumping systems, and will be above the water table except along a short segment of
the SML. Furthermore, there will be no industrial discharges to the system. However,
there is a potential for decomposition of organic matter and the development of
anaerobic conditions which may result in hydrogen sulfide production. Chlorination
either at the intake or during periodic sediment flushing in the tunnel system should
alleviate or eliminate gas and odor problems.
(c)    Shentongzui Reservoir
The potential impact of this reservoir on water quality should be minor, as compared
the Wanjiazhai reservoir because it is a much smaller regulating reservoir and has a
shorter detention time.
(d)   Fen River System Upstream of Fen I Reservoir and the Fen I Reservoir
As discussed previously, existing water quality in the Fen River (Table 5.4.2-2) is
similar to that in the Yellow River. The water quality appears acceptable except for a
few  parameters which exceed the Surface Water Quality Standards.   These
exceedances will require water treatment in order to meet the quality standards for
final industrial and community water uses. Taiyuan city will transport water from the
Fen I reservoir to the new Huyan water treatment plant and then distribute the treated
water for final use. Use of the conventional rapid sand filtration process together with
effluent chlorination should meet this need.
The objective of the project is to deliver water to the Taiyuan area. However, water in
Fen River will be available for local domestic, industrial and agricultural uses unless
5-29



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final Report
access is restricted and regulations are established and enforced to prevent the use of
river water. If access to the river is not controlled, the availability of new water may
result in increased industrial, urban and agricultural activitier and subsequent increases
in wastewater discharges to the river. In addition, less water will be available for
Taiyuan.
5.4.2.2.2   Predicted Water Quality at Huyan Water Treatment Plant
The mineral quality of water entering the Fen River at the end of the SML would be
essentially the same as that at the intake at Wanjiazhai. This appears to be a reasonable
assumption since the tunnels and the rest of the conveyance system will be enclosed.
The impact of reservoirs on water quality is also expected to be minor and manageable.
Therefore, the concentrations of water quality parameters in the Fen River after the
discharge point of SML and through the rest of the Fen River system should reflect
volume weighted averages of concentrations in the Yellow River and Fen River. Table
5.4.2-9 illustrates the water quality for the raw water prior to the Huyan water
treatment plant.
The quality is adequate for water supply except for the four following constituents
which exceed the Class m Surface Water Standards (Table 5.4.1-2); iron, manganese,
COD and ammonia. However, iron and manganese have been determined to be
associated with suspended solids (SS) in the water, and the conventional rapid sand
filter treatment should remove these two metals easily, as discussed in Section 5.2
Water Supply. COD and ammonia if it becomes necessary may require additional
advanced treatement processes.
5.4.2.2.3    Impact of WWTP on Fen River in Taiyuan City and Downstream
The increased urban and industrial activities resulting from the new water supply will
increase wastewater discharges. To maintain river water quality, new treatment
facilities for the wastes generated from the use of new water will be required prior to
discharge. The Taiyuan Municipal Engineering and Design Institute (TMEDI) has
developed a comprehensive wastewater collection and treatment plan for 2002, 2010
and 2020 to achieve treatment of 100 % of all wastewater generated from the city by
2020. Treatment will involve primary, secondary, and some tertiary as well as using
stabilization ponds in the tributaries and along the banks of Fen River for wastewater
treatment. Details of the plan are discussed in Section 5.3.3 of this Chapter.
5.4.2.2.4   Future Water Quality at Fen River in Taiyuan and Downstream
The existing water quality in Fen River in Taiyuan has been discussed and shown in
Table 5.4.2-7. The following conditions, which show the flow rates and the
concentrations at different flow conditions at Shang Lan where the river enters the
Taiyuan city, are used to predict future water quality for 2002, 2010 and 2020.

* From Table 5.4.2-7
The plan developed by TMiEDI to treat all wastewater generated in Taiyuan when the
new water is available has been discussed in Section 5.3.2 of this Chapter, and is
shown in Table 5.3.2-6.
The following effluent concentrations from various treatment of municipal wastewater
in Taiyuan will be used to predict the impact of wastewater discharge on water quality
in Fen River:
Treatment          Effluent Concentration, mg/I
COD         BOD

_ ~ ~ ~ ~ -     -   -   -- --    -_ - - - - ---- - - -
Stabilization ponds along the side of Fen River
Assuming that the wastewater generated will undergo various treatment levels as
planned, the expected resultant water quality in the Fen River (voiume weighted
averages) in years 2002, 2010 and 2020 is shown in Table 5.4.2-10. The spreadsheet
showing the calculations is attached here as Table 5.4.2-11. Based on the calculations,
the concentration of COD in the Fen River is expected to remain below 50 mg/I if all
wastewater is treated to meet appropriate standards. The projected water quality in
Fen River in Taiyuan will be much better than the water quality in Fen River today.
5.4.2.3      Recommendations
The following protective measures have been identified, as necessary, to minimize
possible impacts on surface water quality as a result of the WWTP project:
I.    The imported water supply will be expensive because of high pumping and
transmission costs. Therefore, its use should be limited to meeting critical
urban and industrial growth needs and preferably those that minimize the
potential for pollution. The city should develop a pricing system to encourage
use of new water for productive and relatively clean industrial processes. Note
that the pricing system, to be effective, must cover both local as well as
imported sources.
II.    The wastewater generated from increased industrial and urban activities should
be recycled/reused to the extent feasible. This approach can be promoted by
enforcing requirements to treat water before discharge and by pricing.
5-31



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final Reiort
III.   A permit system should be established and managed by the appropriate local
control agency as discussed in Section 5.5. This agency will set discharge
standards for urban and industrial wastewaters to limit pollutant loading to the
river. Each significant pollution source (urban, industrial, and agricultural)
should have to obtain a permit which delineates the requirements to be met by
the pollution source before discharge of waste effluent. This permit will specify
the effluent standards to be met, plant requirements for minimizing water use
(including recycling) and waste minimization, and monitoring to be performed
routinely and to be reported by the pollution source. The control agency will
perform the following functions:
A.    Establish appropriate water quality standards, both emission and
ambient, using the National Standards as a guideline, but incorporating
local requirements.
B.    Enforce compliance with the discharge program  by establishing a
separate enforcement branch to prosecute violators, based on
information on non-compliance furnished by the monitoring program.
The penalties for noncompliance could be fines or jail terms for very
serious and repeat offenses.
C.    Effectively monitor the performance for each pollution source.
D.   Establish a river monitoring program for key parameters. The program
should include measurement of key parameters in the water column,
once a month at several locations along the river (e.g., temperature,
suspended solids, turbidity, DO, pH alkalinity, total dissolved solids,
COD, BOD, coliforms and major cations and major anions). Also, river
bottom samples should be analyzed annually, to reduce possible
accumulation of toxics including heavy metals and synthetic organic
compounds.
The permit program may show that it may not be feasible for some small industries to
continue in operation. Consequently, some small industries may have to relocate to
other areas or into industrial estates where a common treatment system can serve a
group of plants, in order to remain competitive.
5.4.3       Groundwater
5.4.3.1     Current Situation
Groundwater may present problems with respect to design of the WWTP tunnels, but
these problems are generally not related to water quality issues. The only possible
groundwater concern related to quality is the potential for infiltration of poor quality
water into the tunnels and for infiltration of slime organisms. Groundwater quality is
already a serious problem due to continuing over-exploitation of groundwater to meet
the domestic, industrial and irrigation needs, and contamination by industrial
wastewaters.
5-32



Wanliiazhai Water Transfer Project                               Final Report
Some tunnels systems in other countries have experienced serious problems due to
slime growth which greatly reduces water quality. Should the problem occur, it can be
controlled by suitable chlorination.
5.4.3.2     Impact of WWTP on Groundwater Quality
The WWTP will mark-edly increase the supply of surface water in Taiyuan and hence
might be expected to decrease dependence on use of groundwater. This may not
occur, however, because the imported water will be more costly than groundwater. In
this situation, continuing over-use of groundwater will likely be encouraged unless
pricing or other controls are established. Hence it will be necessary to establish such
control so that the overall freshwater resource will be optimally used (as discussed in
Section 5.3).
5.4.3.3     Recommendations
The WWTP must impose strict controls on use of groundwater so that it will cost as
much or more than new water, and thus discontinue use of groundwater and enable the
groundwater basin to recover. Also, the WWTP monitoring program for water quality
could include both surface water and groundwater in the service areas, in order to
monitor groundwater use as well as changes in water quality.
5.4.4       Environmental Monitoring
This program is to begin with establishment of the EMO. It will comprise the
following activities as described below. The numbers of sampling stations indicated
are considered to be the minimum needed to establish a reliable data base.
(a) Quarterly sampling of imported water at a series of stations along the GML, SML,
and Connection Works (total of about 20 stations); analysis for the parameters
shown in 5.4.2-2 above, plus eutrophication parameters (nitrogen and phosphorus
form) and gross toxicity; evaluation of the data to identify unacceptable quality
degradation, and, if identified, presentation of recommendations for modification;
and, annual evaluation of the adequacy of the monitoring program with
recommendations for needed improvements.
(b) Quarterly sampling of existing surface waters in ESA at a series of stations (total of
about 20); analysis for Class III parameters; evaluation of data to identify
unacceptable degradation and, if identified, presentation of recommendations for
modification; annual sampling of bottom sediments in streams (at a few selected
stations) with analyses to detect accumulation of toxic substances; and annual
review and presentation of recommendations for improvements to the monitoring
program.
(c) Annual sampling of groundwater at some of the stations (20) in ESA; including
parameters for drinking water purposes; evaluation of data to identify unacceptable
degradation, and if identified, presentation of recommendations for modification;
5-33



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final Repot
and, annual review and presentation of recommendations for improvement to the
monitoring program.
5.4.5        Summary and Conclusions
(a) The impact of the planned WWTP water conveyance system on the quality of the
imported water should not be significant for all salient water quality parameters
because the system will comprise mostly tunnels and culverts that will be enclosed.
However, the receiving Fen River is an open stream and will be vulnerable to
contamination.
(b) The quality of the raw water delivered to Taiyuan and other service areas will
correspond to Class III in the National Goverment's classification system. Based
on the available data on Yellow River water quality at Wanjiazhai and elsewhere in
the Yellow River system, it appears that the imported water delivered to the
service areas will be suitable for a raw water supply for all intended uses, with
treatment needed to meet drinking water standards. Conventional rapid sand
filtration with effluent chlorination should meet this need.
(c) The WWTP project is not expected to adversely affect groundwater quality in the
ESA except during the construction stages when use of groundwater by the CC
must be strictly controlled.
(d) The major potential impact on water quality is expected to be increased industrial
and urban wastewater discharges generated by the availability of new water. The
city of Taiyuan will have to provide wastewater collection and treatment for all
new and existing sources, in order to maintain water quality in the river. If the
treatment plan developed by Taiyuan MEDI is implemented, it is expected that the
water quality in Fen River will not be adversely impacted by wastewater
discharges. The predicted COD concentration in the Fen River would be much
lower than the current condition at XMao Dian, as shown in Table 5;4.2-10. In
addition, Taiyuan should maximize water recycling and the reuse of wastewater in
order to conserve water as well as to minimize potential adverse impacts on the
Fen River.
(e) Protective measures will be implemented to alleviate potential impacts on the
quality of surface water and groundwater. One needed measure is to price the
water in a way that will encourage water recycling and wastewater treatment. A
complementary measure will be implementation of a permit system similar to that
used in the USA to require industries and municipalities to treat wastewater to
meet standards prior to discharge.  A permit system  involves establishing
appropriate discharge standards, monitoring the quality of discharge effluents, and
enforcing the regulations through a penalty system for violators. River water
toxicity will be controlled, primarily by the use of the permit system, so that
existing toxicity discharges from industries will cease. The pricing, implementation
of a permit system and other functions could be best performed by an area-wide
water control agency.

Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                 Final Report
(f) The control agency will have responsibility for continuing evaluation of the water
supply/use situation in the Taiyuan service area, as the basis for developing the
optimal plan for water use and reuse and river water pollution control. In this plan,
groundwater use will be minimized so that over-pumping will be stopped and so
the groundwater levels can be recovered, including use of groundwater recharging.
The plan will place high priority on use of treated wastewater effluents for industry
and irrigation and thus conserve freshwater for community use including drinking.
(g) Overall, water treatment, water recycling, water reuse and wastewater treatment
must be an integral part of the overall WWTP project. If any one of these
components is neglected, it could affect the ultimate water quality of the river and,
compromise the goal of the WWTP project.
5.5  INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT FOR WATER SUPPLY AND
POLLUTION CONTROL
5.5.1 Target
As presented earlier in the Introduction of this Chapter, the target for water use and
pollution control when the new water becomes available is to ensure optimal use of the
total freshwater supply in Taiyuan, including both imported and local resources. The
target should include:
(a) Efficient water supply system with minimum wastage.
(b) Maximum feasible reuse (for both people and industry).
(c) Maintain acceptable water quality in Fen River (within city, downstream).
(d) Municipal sewage system (collection, treatment, disposal) as needed for (b) (c).
(e) Industrial waste management as needed for (b) (c).
(f) Attention to solid waste management as needed for (c).
(g) Minimize any water use for agriculture, including reuse, where such water is
needed for higher priority uses.
Figure 5.5.1-1 shows the conceptual approach for optimal use and reuse of water for
Taiyuan.
The existing management structure for planning, operations, investment, fee collection
and financing of water supply and pollution control is fragmented, and it may not be
feasible using existing institutions, to provide the organization framework to achieve
the target for optimal use. Ideally, the provision of water supply, sewerage services,
and water reuse should be integrated within a single entity, which would have full
responsibility for the delivery, treatment and distribution of water, for collection,
treatment and disposal of sewage and sewage sludge within the urban area including
river water pollution control, and for managing use of treated effluents for additional
water supply.  The formation of such an entity could be considered as a Water
Management Holding Company, which would become financially autonomous through
the collection of user charges for water uses and wastewater collection, treatment and
disposal.

Figure 5.5.1-2 Shows the existing Taiyuan Municipal Water Supply and sewage
management system.
5.5.2       Current Situation
5.5.2.1     Water Resources and Water Use Management
Groundwater and surface water are two major sources of water in Taiyuan.
Groundwater is used primarily for domestic and industrial uses, while surface water is
used for irrigation and some industrial uses. A number of agencies at provincial and
city levels are involved in the supply and use of both water resources, and the
management systems are discussed in the following:
Groundwater resource is managed by the Taiyuan Municipal Water Resources
Management Committee (MWRMC) in the Taiyuan city. However, Taiyuan Water
Supply Company (TWSC) manages the operation, treatment and distribution of the
groundwater to most of the service area in the Taiyuan City. Figure 5.5.2-1 shows the
institutional structure and staffing of the company. Taiyuan Municipal Water
Resources Management Committee also provides water to the suburban districts and
the counties as well as providing surface water to the power and steel industries, and
for agriculture.
Management of surface water resource in the Taiyuan area belongs to the Shangxi
Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau (WCB), which is also in charge of the surface
water resource for the Shangxi province. The Bureau has two agencies in charge of
surface water management; the Water Management Office (WMO) and the
Agricultural Water Use Office (AWUO). The Water Management Office deals
primarily with surface water for industrial uses, and works with the Agricultural Water
Use Office to allocate water for use in irrigation. Management of Fen River water is
under the Fen Reservoir Management Authority (FRMA), which is within the Water
Management Office of the WCB. However, water quality monitoring and management
are the responsibilities of the City Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) in the
Taiyuan area, or the Provincial EPB, if outside of the Taiyuan service area. Figure
5.5.2-1 illustrates the organizations involved in water resources and water supply
management.
5.5.2.2     Wastewater Management
The operation and management of municipal wastewater treatment systems is carried
out by the Urban Engineering Management Bureau (UEMB) of the Taiyuan City.
Figure 5.5.2-3 shows the organization and function of the UEMB and Figure 5.5.24
shows the organization and funcctiona of Taiyuan Drainage Division. The planning and
design of all treatment plants and most- sewers are by Taiyuan Municipal Engineering
and Design Institute (TMEDI) which works for the Municipal Engineering Planning
Bureau (MEPB). However, the effluent monitoring for discharging into Fen river is
the responsibility of City EPB, who also has the responsibility for monitoring most
industrial wastewater operations for permit compliance. Recycled water becomes
water resource, and is managed by the Water Conservation Office (WCO) of the
5-36



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                               Final Report
Taiyuan City, which also has the responsibilities of setting and enforcing regulations
for water conservation in Taiyuan.
Most offices including TWSC, UEMB, MEPB, City EPB, and WCO report to the
Taiyuan Urban Construction Committee (UCC), who and MWRMC both report to the
mayor's office in the city govemment. The provincial WCB and EPB report to the
Provincial Water Resources and Use Committee which regulates and directs all water
supply and pollution control issues in the Shangxi province, and is headed by the
Governor. The organizations and their functions relating to wastewater management
of these offices are also shown in Figure 5.5.2- 1.
The existing management structure for water resources, use, and reuse, as well as
wastewater treatment, discharge, monitoring and recycling for the city involves at least
11 agencies in the provincial and city levels, and is very complex. The ability and
effectiveness of managing water and wastewater for optimal use will be in question
when the new water becomes available. There is a definite need to simplify the
organizations involved and streamline the management structure and process, so that
the Taiyuan city can effectively manage its existing and new water for optimal use,
including managing its wastewater for optimal reuse and minimal impact on the river
quality.
5.5.3       Integrated Management For Water Supply and Pollution Control
5.3.3.1     Using Existing Agencies
The existing management organization structure described previously could be
improved to provide the management of water and wastewater when WWTP is
completed. In this scenario, the Yellow River Diversion Project (YRDP) office would
sell new water to the city and the city would work with provincial agencies such as
WCB and EPB to manage the water resources, transmission, treatment and distribution
for final use. The city would also work with Provincial EPB to manage wastewater
treatment and discharge, and to monitor and maintain water quality in Fen River. The
major drawback is the separation of management on water supply and pollution
control, both are essential elements for achieving optimal use. In addition, water
recycling and reuse would be in the hands of Water Conservation Office whose main
function is water conservation and who has very little capability nor power in
managing water for optimal use.
5.3.3.2     Proposed New Agency
A more effective way to ensure optimal use and to protect the Fen river system is by
the establishment of an area-wide regulatory and implementation company that would
develop and implement water supply and pollution control systems. This area-wide
company would perform functions which are currently being conducted by various
govemmental agencies including provincial and city Environmental Protection Bureaus
(EPB) and Water Conservancy Bureaus (WCB), the Taiyuan Urban Construction
Committee (UCC) and the Yellow River Diversion Project office (YRDP), and have
profit and loss responsibilities. Each of these agencies is currently concemed with
5-37



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final ReDon
water use and distribution, waste management and water pollution control to promote
optimal use of water in only a part of the service area.
YRDP is currently studying the concept of an integrated system under the management
of a single agency. Based on the discussions with the YRDP, the initial conceptual
plan is to form the Tayuan Water Enterprise Holding Company (TWEHC), which
would integrate existing city and provincial water and wastewater management offices
and agencies into- a new centralized organization with area-wide coverage. This
company would manage all water supply and pollution control related issues, and
would have its own profits and losses. The holding company would consist of 5
individual subsidiary companies each has its own charter. These five subsidiary
companies are shown in Figure 5.5.3-1, and their functions relating to water supply
and wastewater management are shown in Figure 5.5.3-2. The functions of each of the
five companies are briefly described in the following:
(a) Yellow River Water Management Company (YRWMC)
.This company would be the current YRDP in operating and maintaining the GTL,
' STL and the connection work to ensure delivery of Yellow River water with
sufficient quality to Taiyuan. The company would sell the new water to the
Taiyuan Water Supply Company and to pay off the loan for the WWTP project
from the receipt.
(b) Fen River Water Management Company (FRWMC)
This company would combine the functions of the current Water Management
Office including the Fen Reservoir Authority, and the Agricultural Water Use
Office of the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau. The company would have the
responsibilities of managing the surface water resource in Fen River for industrial
and agricultural uses, and operating Fen Reservoir to regulate water supply for
Taiyuan. The company would charge its sister company, the Yellow River Water
Management Company for using the Fen River upstream of Fen 1 Reservoir and
the Reservoir to deliver Yellow River water to Taiyuan. FRWMC would also have
the responsibilities of maintaining the water quality in Fen River and would charge
a fee for any wastewater or treated effluent entering the Fen River system. Use of
Fen River water for industrial and agricultural use is also under FRWMC's
managemnent, and users would pay for the water used.
(c) Taiyuan Water Supply Company (TWSC)
This company would essentially be the existing Taiyuan Water Supply Company
which provides groundwater as well as future new water from Fen I Reservoir to
the urban and industrial users. The'company would buy Yellow River water from
its sister company YRWMC, and buy groundwater from another sister company
TGRMC. It then sells the water to the end users after treatment. The company
would own and operate the treatment plants and the distribution system.
Figure 5.5.3-3 shows the structure and staffing of the TWSC.
5-38



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                               Final Report
(d) Taiyuan Groundwater Resources Management Company (TGRMC)
This company would perform the same functions as the existing Taiyuan Municipal
Water Resources Management Committee in managing groundwater supply for the
industries and other agencies which use their own wells. However, the company
would regulate and manage all other groundwater resources in the Taiyuan area.
Basically, the company would sell groundwater to its customers, which include the
individual industrial and municipal facilities, and the Taiyuan Water Supply
Company, for using groundwater as water supply.
(e) Taiyuan Wastewater Management Company
The functions of this company would be to plan and manage all wastewater
collection, treatment, and discharge from municipal and industrial sources, and
also manage wastewater recycling and reuse. The company would include parts
of existing UEMB and MEPB agencies in Taiyuan which are involved in
wastewater planning, management, and operation, and also City and Provincial
EPBs which deal with water pollution control. It would operate the collection and
treatment systems and charge the industrial facilities or municipalities for the
wastewater entering the sewerage system. It would also have the responsibilities
for water or treated effluent for reuse, taking over the function of Water
Conservation Office. The company would pay surcharges to its sister company
FRWMC for discharging its treated effluent into the Fen River.
Figure 5.5.3-4 shows the structure and staffing of the company.
The Chairman of the Board of the Directors for the holding company should be
appointed by the Governor or Senior Officers in the China Government.
5.5.4       Environmental Monitoring
5.5.4.1     Water Supply/Quality Monitoring
Currently, Taiyuan has 10 surface water monitoring stations along the Fen River from
Fen 1 Reservoir to Xiao Dian in the south of the Taiyuan city, and 6 of the stations are
located inside the city area. River water samples are collected three times a year
during May, August and October. Water samples are analyzed for 37 constituents
including COD, BOD, DO, heavy metals and toxic organics.
The City Environmental Protection Bureau has developed a plan to add additional 6
monitoring stations in the same stretch of Fen River to cover more areas where heavy
municipal and industrial wastewater discharge. In addition, sampling frequency is to
be increased from 3 to 6 times a year, and the analyses be increased to 65 parameters
including radionuclealides and PCB.
The plan developed by City EPB may not be sufficient to address water supply and
quality monitoring. The water supply monitoring will be checked and modified as
needed to include the following:
5-39



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final Report
(a)   Water amounts used for residences, commercial buildings, public buildings,
industries, and agriculture.
(b)   Adequacy of water supply for (a) (present and future).
(c)    Quality of supply for (a) including quarterly sampling and analyses and series of
stations (estimated total of about 100) using parameters indicating adequacy
for drinking purposes.  These include turbidity, total dissolved solids,
coliforms, pH and alkalinity, major cations and major anions, iron and
manganese, and color.
(d)   Adequacy of quality for (a).
(e)   Recommendation for needed improvements (technical and institutional).
The water quality monitoring wlll comprise the following activities:
(a)   This will include (i) quarterly sampling of quality of imported water at series of
stations along the GML, SML, and Connection Works (total of about 20
stations), (ii) analysis as shown in (c) above, plus eutrophication parameters
(nitrogen and phosphorus forn) and gross toxicity; (iii) evaluation of these data
to determine any evidences of unacceptable quality degradation; and (iv)
explanation of these; and (v) recommendations for needed improvements, and
(vi) annual evaluation of adequacy of monitoring program with
recommendations for needed imnprovements.
(b)   Quarterly sampling of quality of existing surface waters, using a series of
stations (total of about 20); analysis of these for Class m parameters;
evaluation of data to determine any conditions of unacceptability with
recommendations for improvements in controlling pollution discharges. Also
annual sampling of bottom sediments in streams (selected few stations) with
analyses for detecting accumulation of toxic substances. Annual review and
improvements of monitoring program.
(c)   Annual sampling of quality of groundwaters which are utilized for water
supply, including parameters for drinking water purposes, using series of
stations (say 20 total); evaluation of data to detect evidences of unacceptability
with recommendations for needed improvements, and annual review and
improvement; in monitoring program.
5.5.4.2     Water Pollution Control Monitoring
Environmental monitoring for water pollution control is carried out by the Monitoring
Division of Taiyuan City EPB. The Division has about 90 people including 60
engineers, and over 450 monitoring devices and analytical equipment. The equipment
includes AA, GC, Infrared Spectroscopy and Fluorescent Spectroscopy.
Environmental monitoring for wastewater discharge concentrates in the City of
Taiyuan. Monitoring of wastewater flow and concentrations is done on 39 industrial
facilities once a month. Monitoring parameters vary with the types of industries.
City EPB has a plan to increase monitoring for more industrial facilities, and to
implement continuous monitoring stations at major industrial facilities including
5-40



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Project                                 Final Report
Taiyuan Iron and Steel, Taiyuan Fertilizer Plant, Taiyuan Pulp and Paper Plant, and
Taiyuan Cheniical Plant. The plan may still be inadequate since it does not cover all
industrial plants. It only cover major industries.
A comprehensive waste management and water pollution control monitoring program
to be developed by the proposed integrated water use agency (Taiyuan Water
Enterprise Holding Company), will include the following components:
(a)    Review of existing wastewater treatment facilities for both communities and
industries operating under the Permit System. This includes evaluation of their
adequacy for furnishing pollution control and recommendations for needed
improvements.
(b)   Review of existing solid waste management facilities (to be included in the
Permit System) for both communities and industries; evaluation of their
adequacy for pollution control and recommendation for needed improvements.
(d)   Review of agricultural practices in ESA related to water pollution with
recommendations for improvement including use of Fen River water for
irrigation and associated provisions for protection against health hazards.
(e)    Review of all uses of treated sewage effluents as supplemental water supply,
for compliance with meeting water quality standards for these uses
5.5.5        Permit System/Enforcement
Currently, Taiyuan EPB has issued wastewater discharge permits to 36 major
industries for discharge into the treatment plants and for direct discharge into Fen
river. These 36 industries account for 85% of the total industrial flow. However,
monitoring is poor and analytical equipment is scarce making effective control and
enforcement difficult.
The future plan is to issue permits to over 100 plants, install continuous monitoring
systems at major wastewater dischargers, and purchase new analytical equipment for
their lab. However, there is no enforcement program which would require additional
manpower to monitor and enforce the regulations.
The proposed Permit System will involve the following elements:
(a) Establishment of appropriate design criteria including (i) discharge criteria based
on national minimum standards and local environmental requirements, (ii) for
industries, requirements for in-plant water reuse and use of clean technologies, and
(iii) requirements for periodic monitoring to be carried out by the discharger.
(b) Submitted by the discharging agency of its plan for meeting Item (a), for review
and approval by the Permit Agency.
(c) Issuance of permits to enable industrial facilities and municipal treatment plants to
discharge their wastewater upon meeting the regulations specified in (a) (b).
5-41



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final Renort
(d) Review of periodic monitoring resui-:- submitted say by the dischargers, plus
periodic checking by the Permit Agenc:, *f the adequacy of the monitoring.
(e) Where the discharger is not meeting requirements, application of enforcement
proceedings, including both legal actions and physical actions as appropriate.
The monitoring program will include periodic review of the adequacy of the
management of the permit system elements as noted above, and preparation of
appropriate recommendations for needed improvements.
5.5.6        Environmental Training
Education of industrial and municipal staff and the public about the significance of the
uncontrolled discharges, the importance of treatment and water reuse and the value of
environmental management, monitoring and compliance programs is essential to the
success of the program. Environmental training should at least include the following
areas:
(a) Environmental aspects of water conveyance and supply systems during
construction.
(b) Optimal water use including balancing groundwater, surface water and treated
water for best industrial, municipal and agricultural applications.
(c) Municipal and industrial wastewater treatment for controlled discharges and for
water reuse.
(d) In-plant control and treatment for reuse for optimal reuse.
(e) Environmental monitoring on water quality and effluent discharge
(f) Permit systems and enforcement to protect river quality and environment
(g) New, efficient and cleaner technologies for pollution prevention and waste
minimization
(h) The training program is also discussed in Chapter 8 of this report.
5.5.7        Institutional Strengthening of Taiyuan EPB
In June 1996 the Taiyuan EPB (TEPB) in accordance with earlier discussions with WB
mission members, submitted to WB a proposal for Technical Assistance entitled
"Recommendation on Project of Taiyuan City's Water Pollution Prevention and
Control, WWTP's Sub-Project on Environmental Protection Assistance Financed by
World Bank Loan" (Ref. 164). This is included here as Annex H.
The objective of this proposal is to strengthen TEPB's institutional resources by a
program to be conducted over the next several years including (i) evaluation of water
pollution control management needs for Taiyuan, (ii) studies of on how to utilize the
5-42



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final Report
permit system, including fee charges, (iii) studies on how to utilize clean technology in
industry, and (iv) improvements in water pollution control monitoring. This would be
financed by a grant of US $2 million. In addition, $10 million would be allocated from
the overall project loan for establishment of a "Clean Production Fund".
The Technical Assistance will include some provisions for training in the various
subjects noted above. This would be supplementary and complementary to the training
program proposed by the present EIA in Chapter 8.
5.5.8        Summary and Conclusions
(a) To ensure optimal use of existing and new water, an area-wide regulatory/
implementation company is to be established to perform the functions currently
being accomplished by several governmental agencies. The initial plan is to form a
holding company which would have five subsidiaries each would have its
distinctive functions together to achieve the target of optimal use of water, and
each have its own profit and loss responsibilities.  The functions of the 5
subsidiaries of this new company as related to water and waste management are
illustrated in Figure 5.5.3-2.
(b) The existing permit system is to be upgraded to become really effective including
strict enforcement. This is essential for success of the proposed integrated system.
The program should involve (i) establishing/using appropriate permit procedure,
including requirement for recycling and use of clean technologies, (ii) setting
appropriate  discharge  and  reuse  standards,  (iii)  monitoring  discharge
concentrations and river quality, and enforcing requirements through penalties for
violators.
(c) Education and training of industrial and municipal staff and the public about the
significance of uncontrolled discharges and the importance of treatment will be
implemented to promote awareness and acceptance of the program. Details of the
training and education to raise public awareness on water conservation, pollution
control and optimal use of water are discussed in Chapter 8.
(d) The Taiyuan City EPB (TEPB) has submitted a proposal to WB for technical
Assistance in the amount of US $2 million for strengthening TEPB's institutional
resources for TEPB's share in accomplishing the objectives noted above, plus the
recommendation that the overall project loan include an allocation of US $10
million for establishing a Clean Technologies Fund for industries. These programs
are both consistent with and supplementary and complementary to the
recommendations made in the present EIA.

Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                 Final Report
Water conservation is one of the top priorities in Taiyuan and is under the management
of the Water Conservation Office (WCO) in the city government. Over the last few
years, the WCO has taken a number of steps to ensure active water conservation in
the city. These include:
(a) The office has set up and carried out water conservation policies including limited
time and volume for water use for municipal use and certain industrial operations,
penalizing plants or facilities that do not comply with the regulations by fines, and
awarding plants that make efforts to save water.
(b) The city inspects the water supply system especially the distribution system
regularly, and made repairs or replacement to broken or leaky pipes or joints
frequently to minimize the water leakage rate.
(c) The office evaluates new industries based on production output/water use rate and
promotes industries with high output/water rate, i.e., businesses which use less
water.
(d) The office has set up education programs in schools to make aware of the water
conservation programs, and set up training programs for staff and employees to
promote water conservation.
(e) The office promotes water reuse by building water recycling lines to reuse treated
effluent for irrigation and industrial uses.
5.6.1.2     In-Plant Water Recycling and Wastewater Reuse
According to WCO, industries in Taiyuan have been practicing in-plant water recycling
for a number of years, and the city has made significant progress in in-plant recycling.
Based on the data provided by WCO, the city experienced a 50 % increase in in-plant
recycling from 1992 to 1995, as shown in Figure 5.6.1-1. The following table shows
the progress in economic growth, water use and in-plant recycling including cooling
water recycling for the city of Taiyuan in the last 15 years:

Data from EPB also showed that effluent from wastewater treatment is reused for
industrial processing and irrigation purposes. Apparently, significant progress has been
made to water reuse as shown in Figure 5.6.1-2. There has been an increase of over
64 % in wastewater reuse over a 4 year period from 1991 to 1995.

Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                 Final Report
According to City EPB, Taiyuan city has issued 36 wastewater discharge permits to
industrial facilities over the last 15 years. These 36 facilities represent about 89 % of
the total wastewater volume, and 72 % of the total pollutants in wastewater discharged
into the river. The total pollutants is defined as the sum of 10 constituents monitored
and analyzed including COD, Phenol, CN, petroleum, NH3-N, TSS, F, Cu, sulfates
and aniline, Based on the data provided by City EPB, total pollutants discharged into
the Fen River were reduced by 33 % for the 36 plants from 1993 to 1995, as shown in
the following table:

*total pollutants include the 10 parameters defined in the text.
5.6.2.1      Wastewater Treatment Facilities
Currently, Taiyuan has 3 municipal and 2 industrial wastewater treatment plants with a
total treatment capacity of 175,000 crntd, of which 50,000 cm/d of treated effluent are
reused by Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company for industrial processing. Four treatment
plants are secondary treatment plants with activated sludge treatment capabilities, and
one with chemical precipitation for heavy metal removal. Details of the treatment
plants is presented in Section 5.3.2 of this Chapter.
These treatment plants can be upgraded to increase the treatment capacity. The design
capacity for these 5 plants are over 450,000 cmtd.
5.6.2.2      Reduction of Toxic Chemicals
Based on the information provided by the City EPB, Taiyuan City apparently has
successfully reduced the discharge of toxic chemicals including toxic metals to the
environment through a number of steps:
(a) The high metal containing wastewater from Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company is
treated by a chemical precipitation process, and the treated effluent is recycled and
reused in the plant.
(b) There are 67 electroplating operations in Taiyuan. All electroplating operations are
required to pretreated their wastewater to remove heavy metils.
(c) Coal mining in Taiyuan uses lead battery in its operation. The mining companies
are required to treat the lead containing wastewater from the spent batteries, and
have reported a high reduction in lead concentrations in treating their wastewater
using lime precipitation prior to discharge.

in 1995 are shown in the following table:

5.6.3       Institutional Control
As discussed earlier, water conservation and water reuse are the responsibilities of
Water Conservation Office, and water pollution control is the responsibility of City
EPB. The city EPB has over 180 people and 9 divisions as illustrated in Figure 5.6.4-
1.
The main functions of City EPB in water pollution control are environmental
monitoring of rivers and treatment plant effluents, management of permit systems, and
collection of surcharges and fines from wastewater discharges. In addition, the City
EPB conducts research and development of environmental technologies, and provides
training and education programs on environmental related topics. The agency also
works with Provincial EPB to draft as well as enforce environmental regulations for
the city. Existing envirommental monitoring, pemit systems and training practices
have been discussed in Section 5.5.4, 5.5.5, and 5.5.6 of this Chapter.
5.6.4 Summary
Despite the many difficulties involved, the Taiyuan city agencies, working in close
cooperation with the Provincial agencies, have over the past decade made impressive
progress in planning and implementing a comprehensive water pollution program in the
Taiyuan service area. This includes:
(a) Preparation of a comprehensive municipal sewerage managemnent plan, and
implementation of the plan including treatment of some 19 % of the total city
sewage, with planning to achieve comprehensive control by year 2020.
(b) Establish of a permit system for coditrol of industrial waste discharges, resulting in
much more plant recycling and use of in-plant treatment to meet discharge
requirements including reduction in discharge of heavy metals.
(c) Establishment of a comprehensive water quality monitoring program, covering
both pollution sources and ambient water quality of receiving waters, to gain
factual data on the extent and nature of waste management problems.

WVaniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                      Final Report
(d) Initiation of other measures including public education on water conservation,
reducing leakage in water supply distribution, promoting industrial water reuses
and other reuse of treated effluents.
In summary, these activities represent a good beginning steps towards achieving
optimal water use/reuse/pollution control, and are firm evidence of the keen interest of
the local officials in striving to solve their water use/pollution problems and of their
willingness to give real support to achieving the goals of the proposed WWTP.

CHAPTER 6
ADDITIONAL STUDIES
6.1 Introduction
The EIA process has been continually evolving since its beginning in late 1960s, and
this experience has shown the need for including a number of specific evaluations in
addition to those done in Chapters 4 and 5. These additional studies which are
commonly included in EIAs since about 1992, include the following: (i) public
participation, (ii) compliance with environmental laws, (iii) environmental economics,
and (iv) risk assessment. The EIA guidelines utilized in China, as formulated by
NEPA, include provision for these additional studies (Ref. 206).
6.2 Public Participation
6.2.1 Itroduction
The concept of WWTP originated in the late 1950s and this resulted in a series of
meetings involving MWR and other Central Government agencies, various Shanxi
Province agencies; and various local agencies aimed at preparing and implementing a
definitive project plan. This led to establishment of preliminary YRDP operations in
1958, then to a preliminary YRDP office in 1977, and then in 1989 to full-scale
establishment of the present YRDP, with the gole to prepare and implement the
appropriate detailed project plan. In 1992 YRDP began to give detailed attention to
the issue of Public Participation (PP). Significant attention to other Enviornemntal
Aspects began in 1994.
Sections 6.2.2 and 6.2.3 review PP for the WWTP/phase I components. Section 6.2.4
discusses the Wanjiazhai and Huyan projects.
6.2.2 YRDP Public Participation Program
6.2.2.1 Task Description
As part of the present project, a special task was carried out in 1995-96 to identify,
list, describe and summarize the PP work by YRDP dating back to the 1950s, and the
detailed results are given in Annex D. This information is summarized in Table 6.2-1,
covering a total of some 110 "task efforts".
This work comprised numerous meetings, reporting, consultations, investigations, field
surveys, and interviews with the local people especially villagers who would be subject
to resettlement if the several proposed project reservoirs were to be constructed.
The work included all envisioned WWTP components, including several proposed new
reservoirs along the NML and SML (none of which are included in WWTP/Phase I).
6.2.2.2 Evaluation of Task Information
6- 1



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                              Final Report
Table 6.2-2 has been prepared to summarize the information given in Table 6.2-1. This
includes all WWTP/Phase I components excepting Wanjiazhai Reservoir (see Section
6.2.3).
Review of these data shows the following:
(a) Participation by Villagers (individual villagers, village representatives, local
peoples governemnts).
While the earlier tasks efforts by YRDP were focused on dealing with official
governemntal agencies, in 1992 YRDP commenced a program for gaining the views
and support of the villagers per se. Of the total of some 81 task efforts conducted over
the period 1990-95, 42 included direct communications with villagers or their
representatives. The results, shown in detail in Annex D, indicate that in general the
villagers have had meaningfiul opportunities for expressing their views to the WWTP
planners and that they do support the project, assuming due attention to resettlemnent
needs and to other effects on local socio-economics. Commitments have been made by
YRDP to meet these needs. Five of these 41 task efforts included participation by local
wamen's organizations.
(b) Enviromnental Issues Other Than Resettlement
Table 6.2-2 shows that some 11 task efforts dealt with environemntal issues in general
and some 10 specifically with water quality and pollution control issues, practically all
of these since 1994.
6.2.3 Public Participation Task of Resettlement Project Team
6.2.3.1 Summary Tabulations
The overall YRDP project planning includes, in addition to the EIA Study, a separate
Resettlement (RS) Study and Report. The RS Study is presented in several chapters,
one entitled "Participation and Consultation". Review of this chapter indicates that the
villagers who will need to be resettled, or are aggected by the resettlement operations,
have had significant opportunities to give their views to the RS planners and have
indicated support of the project assuming a competent RS plan is carried out.
6.2.3.2 Additional Comments on RS Plan
Task 4.5 of the EIA Study, entitled "Environemntal Review of Resettlement", gives an
appraisal of environemtnal aspects of the RS planning from the EIA point of view.
6.2.4 Publicity by Mass Media
Over recent year, many achieves of WWTP have been reported upon by the media
including by "Shanxi Daily", Shanxi Radio Station, Shanxi TV Station, Taiyuan TV
Station, "Shanxi Economic News", Xinhua News Agency, and other news agencies.
6 - 2



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                               Final Report
Approaches used for publicizing the WWTP include trend reports, special reports,
photographs, and special theatrical festivals.
The YRDP has established a press and propaganda center to have primary
responsibility for publicizing the WWTP. This center compiles and publishes "WWTP
News", with 3,500 or more copies published for each issue, which are distributed in
and out of Shanxi Province.
This program is believed to give the public a meaningful understanding of WWTP and
to be helpful in gaining public support.
6.2.5 Wanjiazhai and Buyan
YRDP's PP program has not included the Wanjiazhai Dam/Reservoir project nor
Taiyuan City's Huyan project (including the associated pumping plant). However,
discussion of PP for both projects is included in section 4.5 on Resettlement in chapter
4. Also, discussions of the EIA Team with TEPB indicate that Taiyuan City has given
amnple attention to PP for Huyan because of the many sensitivities involved in taking
over the needed urban lands
6.3 Compliance with Environmental Laws
6.3.1 Introduction
The purpose of Section 6.3 is to indicate that the WWTP plan incorporates provisions
to comply with Chinese laws and regulations on environment protection and that the
EIA for WWTP is based on Chinese laws and regulations.
6.3.2 Basic Environmental Laws and Regulations
A series of enviromnental laws and regulations issued by the Govemrnent of People's
Republic of China and the Government of Shanxi Province are applicable to WWTP.
Mainly the following issued by Chinese Government have been followed in the WWVTP
plan and the current EIA.
(a) Environment Protection Law
This law, issued in 1989, is the fundamental law for environmental protection in China.
It requires that EIA must be a component of the feasibility study of all large and middle
sized develop projects and that the assessment of the impacts of the projects on socio-
economics must be carried out with the EIk
(b) Law of Land Management
The Law of Land Management, issued in 1986, requires that the land requisition for
project construction be minimized and the people who lost their land be properly
compensated and resettled.
(c) Water Law
6 - 3



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final ReCDrt
The Water Law, issued in 1988, is the base law of exploitation, utilization and
protection of water resources. It also requires that the local governments in project
area be responsible for resettlement due to the construction of the project.
(d) Law of Water and Soil Conservation
The Law of Water and Soil Conservation, issued in 1991, requires protection measures
to prevent erosion due to project construction including revegetation, resurfacing and
protect measures for project construction disposals.
(e) Law of Wildlife Protection
The Law of Wildlife Protection, issued in 1988, requires protection measures and
necessawy monitoring activities to protect wildlife in project areas.
(f) Law and Water Pollution Prevention and Control
This law, issued in 1984, is tfie based law for water quality protection which requires
water quality monitoring institutions be established and regular monitoring activities be
conducted and water pollution control measures be planned and implemented for water
projects.
(g) Forest Law
The Forest Law issued in 1984, requires protection measures for natural forests during
project construction and operation stages. It also requires afforestation measures be
conducted in project areas.
(h) Summ$ar
Some other laws issued by Chines Government and many detailed regulations issued
by State Council or its ministries as well as regulations issued by Shama Government
have been followed in the WWTP'plan and the current EIA. Table 6.3-1 summarizes
the environmental laws and regulations applicable to WWTP, as discussed in (a) to (g)
above.
6.3.3 Laws and Regulations related to Resettlement
Laws and regulations related to resettlement have been followed in the WWTP
Resettlement Report (a separate report from EIA Report). Table 6.3-2 shows the laws
and regulations and their applications in WWTP. Section 4.5 includes evaluation of
compliance with these laws and regulations in the WWTP/RS plan.
6.3.4 Summary and Conclusions
A series of Chinese environmental and resettlement-related laws and regulations
promulgated by the Chinese Government and Shanxi Province Government have been
followed in the WWTP plan and the EIA for WWTP.

Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final Rewort
The EPMs and the monitoring programs required in the WWTP plan and developed in
the EIA Report are based on the above mentioned laws and regulations.
6.4 Environmental Economics
6.4.1 Purpose of Task
The purpose of this task is to review the WWTP plan with respect to (a) whether the
project gives fair consideration to the needs of ordinary/poor people in the affected
area (so that it is not another "rich get richer, poor get poorer" project), (b) to check
that the Economic Analysis includes the costs of all EPMs and environmental
monitoring programs specified by the EIA, and (c) to check that the Economic
Analysis includes costs representing environmental damages not offset by the EPMs,
plus credits for any environmental enhancement measures included in the project.
6.4.2 Project Benericiaries
WWTP may truly be said to be a project planned with the primary objectives of
improving the socio-economics of the primary economics earnings areas of Shanxi
province.  These are already critically short of water for virtually all human
development needs including (a) domestic and commercial (b) industrial, and (c)
agricultural needs. The imported water will be used first for municipal purposes,
representing first priority, with second priority to industry to maintain employment
stability, and not for agriculture. It is also planned to reduce use of existing freshwater
resources for agriculture by substituting use of treated sewage effluents.In addition,
the imported water will reduce pressures for more and more groundwater extraction
(now very seriously over-extracted) and for more and more ground level subsidence,
already very serious and causing serious economic/socio-economic losses to all
affected community social sectors. Thus the project may be said to be a truly
economic-cum-environmental-cum social development project.
The argument may be made that the project favors the socio-economics of the
urbanized target areas, which are less poor than the rural areas. This is true, but it is
these target areas that are of prime importance to the over economy and socio-
economics of the entire province.  Also, where reservoirs are to be built along the
transmission routes, it is expected that the resettled rural farmers will be benefited,
that is, their housing and income levels should be improved as a result of the
resettlement, assuming the actual resettlement program lives up to expectations.
6.4.3 Inclusion of Costs in Economic Analysis
Item 6.4.1 (b) has been ensured 6y continuing close working association between the
EIA team and the Phase I Project Economic Expert.. With respect to 6.4.1 (c),
assuming implementation of the recommended EPMs and environmental monitoring
programs, it is expected that the residual net environmental damages will not be
significant. This will be checked periodically by the proposed environmental post-
construction monitoring program to be managed by EMO.

Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                 Final Report
6.5 Risk Assessment
6.5.1 Introduction
Overall the WWTP is a project which, with proper planning and implementation, can
be classified as a quite safe project. These are a number of significant which need to be
managed to offset the hazards, which are discussed below:
6.. 2 Significant Risks
6.5.2.L1 Tunnel Risks
(a) Tunnel Stability/Assured Delivery of Water
The question is whether the WWTP planning for tunnels includes provision for
ensuring delivery of water to the target cities in the event of tunnel collapse due to
earthquakes or any other causes. The present discussion is limited to the Phase I/SML
project. As discussed in Section 4.4.2.1, the Phase I project will furnish storage of two
months in Fen I reservoir, sufficient for ensuring continuing delivery of the Phase I
flow of 350 million m3 per year. Hogshouigou reservoir, to become operative in 2006,
will furnish sufficient storage to ensure continuing flow for the Phase II flow of 640
million m3 per year.
(b) Tunnel Worker Health and Safety
The tunneling construction operations will be a major and in some respects a
pioneering venture for China, and like all major tunneling projects, construction will
pose significant hazards to the workers, and to manage these will require establishment
of an appropriate control system. YRDP recognizes this problem and the contract for
construction will include requirements for the needed controls.
6.5.2.2 Darn Failure Hazard
While the overall WWT? includes a number of dams/reservoir projects, none of these
are included in Phase I. However, the EIA reviewed each of the proposed dams for its
structural stability, especially with respect to earthquake hazards. All of the dams
appear to be safe with failure considered to be virtually impossible (See Section 4.4).
6.5.2.3 Flooding Hazards
None of the proposed dam/reservoir projects will pose any significant flooding hazard
but they will contribute to lessening of flooding problems, especially Wanjaizhai,
Daliang and Haoshuigou. Discharge of the SML water into the Honghe river will
markedly increase the river flow in volumes, but this is a steep canyon zone with no
significant development, hence no damages are expected. When this flow enters the
Fen river (above Fen I reservoir), no significant flooding damage is expected because
of the large hydraulic capacity of the Fen river channel in the reach.
6.5.2.4 Efficient Use of Expensive Imported Water
6 - 6



Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final Report
Because of the relatively high cost of the imported water to be furnished by WWTP, it
is essential that the Provincial Government and Local Governments establish
institutional systems that will have the authority and the resources to manage the entire
utilization of water in the target area, beginning with the Taiyuan Service Area, to
ensure optimal use of the precious water. This will include strict control of use of both
surface water and groundwater, and optimal management of used waters for
reutilization as supplemental water supply including necessary waste treatment,
including use of the permit system for controlling both water use and for waste
treatment/reuse including collection of revenues to finance the control system as well
as for financing WWTP per se. While this type of program has been successfully
developed in other countries such as Southern California, this type of comprehensive
water/wastewater reuse management is new in China. The WWTP plan recognizes
this and includes provisions for strengthening of the provincial/local agencies to be able
to manage both water use and waste management to achieve the goals including
training in specialized skills and in monitoring.
6.5.2.5 Construction Hazards
In addition to the need for protecting tunnel workers noted in Section 6.5.2.1 (b),
construction of WWTP will pose numerous hazards to environment which are to be
properly managed and offset by incorporating suitable EPMs in the contract for
Construction Contractor, by furnishing Environmental Construction Supervisors to
check the Construction Contractor's operations visits to evaluate adequacy of the
control system. This approach is somewhat new in China, and the nearby Xiaolangdi
project (now under construction) experience uses this approach, is furnishing valuable
guidelines for WWTP.
6.5.2.6 Resettlement
Adequate planning of a competent resettlement plan accommodating each and every
resettlement including "safety net" channels to facilitate receiving and acting upon
complaints, is an integral part of WWTP wherever resettlement is involved, especially
for reservoirs (none included in Phase I). The question is whether the plan will be duly
implemented, considering that this type of program is relatively new in China. The
WWTP plan is to incorporate continuing monitoring of progress in the resettlement
program, including some third party surveillance, to ensure appropriate implementation
of the plan.
6.5.2.7 Siltinz Hazards
As discussed in Section 4.9, the water diverted from Wanjiazhai reservoir will have a
yearly average silt content of 1.3 kg/m3, which will make up only 3.3% of the silt
content of the water in the Fen river, 39.4 kg/m3.
In Project Phase I, a total of 350 million m3 water will be diverted along the SML and
Fen river course to Fen-I reservoir annually, which is nearly the same as the annual
average runoff in Fen river, 368 million m3. Therefore, the silt diverted with water
from Wanjiazhai reservoir would not cause silting hazards to the Fen river course and
Fen- 1 reservoir.
6 - 7



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                               Final Revort
As noted in Section 4.13, the Connection Works will divert the upper layer of water in
Fen- I reservoir through tunnels and pipelines to the Huyan Water Treatment Plant in
Taiyuan. No silting hazards are expected to the plant because the upper layer water of
Fen-1 reservoir has little silt content.
6.5.2.8 Availability of Water for Export
The question here is whether the Yellow River basin has enough water to be able to
allow the export to Shanxi without impairment of development in the lower Yellow
River basin. As explained in Section 4.12, each province in the Yellow River basin has
been allocated a share of the Yellow River water resource, and the WWTP export
amount is within Shanxi's share. Also, Wanjiazhai reservoir's storage will be mainly of
flood waters wich if not stored would be lost to the sea.
6.5.3 Role of Environmental Management Office (EMO)
The WWTP EMO which should be established by YRDP as soon as the project is
approved for implementation, is a very essential component of the overall project for
ensuring that all risks are properly managed, by use of the following measures:
(a) Checking to ensure the detailed plans and specifications for the project
components do include all the EPMs specified in the Elk
(b) Furnishing of Environmental Construction Supervisors to ensure construction
operations comply with specified EPMs.
(c) Implementation of the prescribed Enviromnental Monitoring Program during
both construction and operation stages of project components, including
planning and implementation of corrections in the project design or operations
system indicated to be needed by the monitoring.
(d) Working with the YRDP and Provincial and Local Government Agencies to
achieve optimal utilization of the imported water.
6.5.4 Summary and Condusions
Figure 6.5.4-1 summarizes the Risk Assessment evaluation.
WWTP is expected to be a well engineered project and moreover should be financially
sound because of the precious value of the imported water. The real risk, actually, is
the risk that WWTP might not get built.

CHAPTER 7
ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
7.1   INTRODUCTION
The purpose of Chapter 7 is to assemble the inputs on monitoring needs for the various
environmental tasks, and to put these together to prepare a consolidate environmental
monitoring program which is comprehensive for the entire project, including a
summary tabulation of the consolidated plan.
All these programs are to be minimal cost programs which obtain sufficient information
to satisfy the monitoring objective. This objective is to: (i) ensure that all the EPMs
specified in the EIA will actually be carried out, (ii) to evaluate the monitoring data to
determine whether the project as planned (including design and operational
procedures) is actually furnishing adequate environmental protections and if not, to
indicate the correction measures that are needed. The monitoring plan should be
reviewed annually to check its adequacy, to delete data which are found to be
unneeded, and to add data needed to fill gaps.
Implementation of the monitoring program is the responsibility of the Project's
Environmental Management Office as noted in Chapter 9.
7.2 MONITORING SEls
The following discusses monitoring of the SEIs described in Chapter 4, using
corresponding numbers.
7.2.2 Land Use (Corresponds to Section 4.2)
Following completion of construction, an updated summary land use drawing is to be
prepared, sufficient to show the changes caused by the Phase I project. Thereafter
land uses will be reviewed annually and a summary drawing prepared to show the year-
end current land use pattern.
7.2.3 Hydrology
The proposed hydrology monitoring program is shown in Table 7.2-1.
7.2.4 Special Design Issues
(a)   Construction Period
Monitoring of tunnel conditions for workmen during the construction stage is included
in Section 4.1 1 on Environmental Constraints during Construction.
The program will include observations of the adequacy of disposal of tunnel excavation
materials, including evidence of silt runoff due to inadequate diking and nuisances to or
conflicts with rural villagers. On completion of any disposal area, a check will be made
to ensure that the area has been planted with vegetation or otherwise managed to
prevent erosion runoff.

Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                  Final Report
(b)    Operations Period
Annual observations will be made on whether the silt content of the diverted water is
causing any unanticipated damage to pumps, or other equipment, and whether the
provisions for management of frazzle are adequate. These observations will be
discontinued when there is assurance that there are no significant problems.
7.2.5 Environmental Review of Resettlement
This monitoring program is to be continuing during the construction stage, with
quarterly visits and thereafter is to be done annually. The program details are given in
Tables 4.5.6-10 and 11 in Chapter 4.
7.2.6 Public Health
(a)    Enteric Diseases
During the construction period the ECIs will check to ensure that the public health
EPMs noted in Section 4.14 for construction camps are carried out including
(i) medical checking of construction workers, (ii) medical care for construction
workers, (iii) provision of safe water supply and adequate housing and sanitation
facilities for workers, and (iv) provision of adequate waste management (sewage and
solid wastes). Similarly checks will be made on the adequacy of Items (ii) to (iv) for
resettler homes.
(b)   Insect Vector Diseases
During the construction period the ECIs will check to ensure that constructions camp
buildings are periodically sprayed with insecticide.
When established, the'EMO will check disease statistics in the ESA on (i) haemorragic
fever, (ii) malaria, and (ii) encephalitis, and in event on any marked increased in any of
these (during construction and following construction) the EMO will carry out
appropriate periodic monitoring, namnely of pertinent mosquito larvae for malaria and
encephalitis and of rat densities for haemorragic fever. In addition the EMO will
monitor rat densities in construction camps to check for increases which might be
hazardous for haemorragic fever and should this occur, the EMO will carry out
appropriate rat killing measures.
During the construction period the ECIs will carry out the program of EPMs for
construction camps described in Figure 4.14-4.
7.2.7 Ecology
This progran is to be covered by the ECIs during the construction stage and thereafter
every six months. See Table 7.2-3 for details.
7.2.8 Reservoirs
No detailed reservoir monitoring is planned for Phase I. However, annual inspection
will be made of each reservoir in the ESA and a report prepared for each covering any
issue which may be of significance for planning of Phase II.

Waniiazhai Water Transfer Project                                Final Report
7.2.9 Erosion and Sedimentation
This program is to be covered by the ECIs during the construction stage, and
thereafter every six months. Table 7.2-3 gives details.
7.2.10 Quality of Life
This program is to begin with establishrnent of the EMO.
The purpose comprises annual evaluation of socio-economics and of other quality of
life parameters in the ESA, considering both urban and rural populations, including
(i) income levels and their adequacy, (ii) availability and adequacy of community
facilities related to public health, education, and recreation, (iii) housing/water
supply/sanitation, and (iv) other pertinent parameters.
7.2.11 Construction Operations Constraints
7.2.11.1  Provision of ECIs
As noted in Section 4.11 on constraints during construction, the TOR for the contract
for the construction contractor (CC) is to carry out the EPMs prescribed by the
various EIA tasks. In addition the EMO must furnish Environmental Construction
Inspectors who will monitor the CC to ensure compliance.
7.2.11.2 Use of Expert Panel
The Loan Agreement between the World Bank and the Chinese Government for
YXiaolangdi includes provisions by which the Chinese Government has established an
Expert Panel on Environmental and Resettlement, administered by the project's
Environmental and Resettlement Office, for reviewing performance on environment
and resettlement during the construction stage. The Panel meets every 6 months (for
the duration of the construction stage, up to year 2000) for the purpose of inspecting
and reviewing actual performance in implementation of construction stage EPMs. It is
understood that a similar panel will be established for WWTP.
It is suggested that the YRDP arrange to obtain copies of the reports of the Xiaolangdi
Panel on Environment and Resettlement (Ref 211.1), beginning with the report of
September 1995. As noted in Section 4.11.5, the Xiaolangdi experience in managing
environmental problems during construction is pioneering in many respects for major
water resource projects in China, hence these reports should be valuable guidelines for
YRDP.
7.2.12 Water Transfer Availability
An annual check will be made together with WRB to ensure that the Wanjiazhai raw
water supply can be expected to continue to be available.
7.2.13 Connection Works
Monitoring for the Connection Works is included in the monitoring program described
in sections 7.2.3, 7.2.5, 7.2.7, 7.2.8, 7.2.9, and 7.2.11.

7.2.14 Global Environmental Issues
This comprises annual review of WWTP operations as related to global environmental
concerns including earth warming, ozone layer depletion, and biodiversity, to
determine whether any special actions are indicated.
7.3 MONITORING WATER USE AND POLLUTION CONTROL
The following present monitoring of water supply, use, and pollution control as
discussed in Chapter 5.
7.3.1 Water Supply and Quality
Currently, Taiyuan has 10 surface water monitoring stations along the Fen River from
Fen 1 Reservoir to XMao Dian in the south of the Taiyuan city, and 6 of the stations are
located inside the city area. River water samples are collected three times a year
during May, August and October. Water samples are analyzed for 37 constituents
including COD, BOD, DO, heavy metals, and toxic organics.
The City Environmental Protection Bureau has developed a plan to add additional 6
monitoring stations in the same stretch of Fen River to cover more areas where heavy
municipal and industrial wastewater discharge.. In addition, sampling frequency is to
be increased from 3 to 6 times a year, and the analyses be increased to 65 parameters
including radionuclealides and PCB.
The plan developed by City EPB may not be sufficient to address water supply and
quality monitoring. The water supply monitoring will be checked and modified as
needed to include the following:
(a)   Water amounts used for residences, commercial buildings, public buildings,
industries, and agriculture.
(b)   Adequacy of water supply for (a) (present and future).
(c)   Quality of supply for (a) including quarterly sampling and analyses and series of
stations (estimated total of about 100) using parameters indicating adequacy
for drinking purposes.  These include turbidity, total dissolved solids,
coliforms, pH and allalinity, major cations and major anions, iron and
manganese, and color.
(d)   Adequacy of quality for (a).
(e)   Reconmmendation for needed improvements (technical and institutional).
The water quality monitoring will comprise the following activities:
(a)   This will include (i) quarterly sampling of quality of imported water at series of
stations along the GML, SML, and Connection Works (total of about 20
stations), (ii) analysis as shown in (c) above, plus eutrophication parameters
(nitrogen and phosphorus form) and gross toxicity; (iii) evaluation of these data
to determine any evidences of unacceptable quality degradation; and (iv)

for improvement; in the monitoring program.
7.3.2  Waste Management/Water Pollution Control/Water Reuse
The existing monitoring for waste management and water pollution control is
described in Section 5.5.4.2 of Chapter 5. This program, to be developed under the
aegis of the proposed integrated water use agency (Taiyuan Water Enterprise Holding
Company), will include the following components:
(a) Review of existing wastewater treatment facilities, for both communities and
industries operation under the Permit System. This includes evaluation of their
adequacy for furnishing pollution control, and recommendations for needed
improvements.
(b) Review of existing solid waste management facilities (to be included in the
Permit System) for both communities and industries; evaluation of their
adequacy for pollution control, and recommendation for needed improvements.
(c) Review of agricultural practices in ESA related to water pollution with
recommendations for improvement including use of Fen River water for
irrigation and associated provisions for protection against health hazards.
(d) Review of all uses of treated sewage effluents as supplemental water supply,
for compliance with meeting water qualitv standards for these uses.
7.3.3 Permit System/Enforcement
7.3.3.1 Activities To Be Monitored
As noted in Section 5.5.5 of Chapter 5, the proposed permit system will involve the
following elements:
(a) Establishment of appropriate design criteria including (I) discharge criteria
based on national minimum standards and local environmental requirements,
(ii) for industries, requirements for in-plant water reuse and use of clean
technologies, and requirements for periodic monitoring to be carried out by the
dischargers.
7 - 5



Waniiazhai Water Tmansfer Proiect                             Final Rewort
(b) Submittal by the discharging agency of its plan for meeting Item (a), for review
and approval by the Permit Agency.
(c) Issuance of permits to enable industrial facilities and municipal treatment plants
to discharge their wastewater upon meeting the requirements specified in (a)
(b).
(d) Review of periodic monitoring reports submitted by the dischargers, plus
periodic checking by the Permit Agency of the adequacy of the monitoring.
(e) Where the discharge is not meeting requirements, application of enforcement
proceedings, including both legal actions and physical actions as appropriate.
7.3.3.2 Role of EMO
The monitoring program of the EMO will include periodic review of the adequacy of
the management of the permit system elements as noted above, and preparation of
appropriate recommendations for needed improvements.
7.4 SUMMARIZED MONITORING PROGRAM
This is presented in Table 7.6-1
7.5 MONITORING PARTICIPANTS
The Environmental Management Office (Chapter 8)  will be responsible for
implementing the monitoring programs specified in the EIA, including (i) delineation
of participants and roles for each participating agency, with arrangement for
compensation for any exraordinary costs which should not be borne by the
participating agency, CiH) estimation/evaluation of the monitoring data, (iii) preparation
of periodic reports with recommendations, and (iv) distribution of these reports to
PRC Governmental agencies and to WB.
Much of the monitoring work is to be done by the regular governmental agencies. The
role of the EMO is to serve as Monitoring Coordinator and to fill gaps which cannot
be appropriately managed by the regular agencies.
7.6 MONITORING COSTS
7.6..1 Summarized Costs for EMO
These are shown in Table 7.6-1.
7.6.2 Monitoring Importance Related to Costs
Experience in the western world shows conclusively that, without effective monitoring,
it is not reasonable to expect there will be effective comnpliance. This includes
utilization of the Permit System for controlling industrial wastes. The saying in
California is, "No monitoring, no compliance". Most developing countries have yet to
understand this principle, have not developed effective monitoring programs, and
regard monitoring costs as a kind of unnecessary overhead. Actually the monitoring
7 - 6



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                               Final Report
costs represent a very small percentage of total project cost, and the benefit/cost ratio
for effective monitoring is believed to be highest of all project components.
7.7 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
An essential component of the overall WWTP is its Environmental Monitoring
Program, which is to. cover both the construction and operations stages of the project,
thus covering a period of some 23 years. The monitoring work should begin as soon
as the Environmental Management Office becomes operative. The summarized
monitoring program is shown in Table 7.6-1 in terms of EMO professional mm, for
each monitoring task and for totals.
Each of the monitoring tasks shown in Table 7.6-1 is to be managed by a designated
member of the professional EMO staff. For the construction stage, the ECIs will
carry out the field controls of the construction operations, under the direction of the
EMO.
The monitoring program is to be managed and supervised by the EMO, and much of
the detailed field work done by the ECIs and by the EMO professional staff. However,
other agencies, including the provincial EPB, WRB, AES and Taiyuan City are to
participate in the field work in accordance with agreements with YRDP. Costs for
monitoring work by these other agencies, which is outside their normal scope of
monitoring, are to reimbursed by YRDP.
Note that the overall monitoring program includes essentially two components, (i)
monitoring to ensure continuing delivery of water to the service area, and (ii)
monitoring to ensure optimal use of the imported (and expensive) water in the service
area and to maintain acceptable levels of water quality in the downstream Fen River.
The monitoring costs are significant but actually very small as related to total WWTP
costs, and the benefit/cost ratio will be large because the monitoring is absolutely
essential to the success of the project.

CHAPTER 8
ENVIRONMENTAL TRAINING
8.1   PURPOSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL TRAINING
Implementation of WWTP will introduce a huge new complex Engineering System in
the ESA, and construction and operation of the system will require a number of
specialized skills which are not now present in YRDP and the provincial and local
governmental agencies involved in the project. Chapter 8 assesses the needs for such
specialized training and presents the proposed training program to be inlcuded in the
core WWTP/Phase I budget.
The overall WWTP may be considered as including essentially two components, (i)
delivery of water to the target service areas, and (ii) optimal use of the delivered water
including waste management and water pollution control. The proposed training
program focuses on Item (ii). Hence the training program is concemed mainly on the
issues discussed in Chapter 5 or Water Supply and Pollution Control, and especially
Section 5.4 or Integrated Management for Water Supply and Pollution Control.
However, the program also includes attention to the engineering aspects of public
health protection in planning/implementing water resouce development projects, to
enable Chinese staff to give due attention to this parameter in future water resouce
development planning.
In addition, the overall training program inlcudes a special program for TEPB, as
discussed in Section 8.4 below.
8.2 COMPONENTS OF SPECLALIZED TRAINING PROGRAM
8.2.1 Introduction
The specialized fields where training is critically needed includes six subject areas as
discussed below.
8.2.2 Integrated Management of Water Resourees
This means integration of water supply, waste treatment, water pollution control, and
water reuse into a single comprehensive water management system which is
comprehensive for the overall service area, including institutional, economic, legal, and
financial as well as engineering aspects, so that all of the available water resources,
both local and imported waters, are most wisely used for meeting needs for continuing
growth of the service area including needs for domestic, commercial, industrial, and
agricultural purposes, including maximum reuse and minimum wastage of the area's
precious fresh water resources. This recognizes that the availability of freshwater is
expected to be the limiting parameter governing the future growth of the area.

Waniiazhai Water Thnsfer Proiect                                  Fmal Report
8.2.3 Water Supply
The question is, how best to utilize the available water supply for optimal use in the
target areas, among domestic, commercial, industrial, and irrigation users, especially
considering the changing balance between these various users as the areas continue to
develop, including:
(a) Reducing domestic and commercial demand by special measures, such as
use of lower water consuming toilets, lower water use bathing methods,
etc.
(b) Reducing industrial demand by recycling and reuse of municipal sewage
effluents for industrial water supply.
(c) Reducing irrigation demand by use of lower-water use techniques.
(d) Balancing use of surface water versus groundwater, including pricing
systems, so that both sources are optionally utilized, and so that water users
do not favor use of groundwater to evade costs for surface waters, and use
of the permit system for allocating and control of water use, including
periodic monitoring to support the permit system.
(e) Use of tailored environmental standards for (a), (b), (c), (d) above which
appropriately recognize the need for achieving maximum use of the
available water.
8.2.4 Water Pollution Control
This includes the following:
(a) Planning and management of the permit system for control of liquid and
solid wastes from all sources, but especially for industries and commercial
establishments, including use of special measures for reducing water
consumption and for recycling.
(b) Maximum reuse of urban sewage effluents for industrial water supply and
for irrigation, including use of the permit system whereby individual
industries are required to remove toxic substances which would render the
sewage effluents unfit for irrigation or other beneficial uses.
(c) Use of appropriate environmental standards for (a) and (b) above.
8.2.5 Sanitary Engineering Aspects of Disease Control
These include:
8 - 2



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                 Final Reoort
(a) Monitoring of quality of water supply utilized for domestic and commercial
purposes, especially safety of supply.
(b) Checking of disease statistics in the area/region relating to insect diseases,
including haemorragic fever, malaria, and encephalitis, and in the event of
any marked increases in any of these, periodic monitoring of larvae of
species of disease transmitting mosquitoes and of density of rats.
8.2.6 Simplification of Monitoring Programs
This includes:
(a) Design of water quality monitoring program for WWTP to utilize only
appropriate parameters (instead of everthing in the book) to achieve
minimum costs and maximum cost effectiveness.
(b) Design of socio-economic monitoring program for WWTP which uses only
appropriate parameters for evaluating impact of WWTP, in order to
achieve minimum costs and maximum cost effectiveness.
8.2.7 Solid Waste Management
This is training in planning and operation of solid waste management systems whch are
appropriate for use in EIA, including engineering, economic, financing, and
institutional aspects.
8.3    TRAINING PROGRAM
The suggested training program would include the following (see Figure 8-1):
(a) Selection of Chinese faculty comprising experts on part-time basis, each for
8.2.2, 8.2.3, 8.2.4/8.2.6(a), 8.2.5, and 8.2.7.
(b) Training of selected faculty by four foreign experts, with assignments as
shown in Figure 8-1. Classes by selected faculty, held every six months for
one year, each for 2 weeks, for officials of participating agencies (YRDP,
provincial, local), with say 20 trainees per class except 10 trainees per class
for 8.2.5.
(c) Foreign training for 16 selected officials (2 each from the agencies
involved) in USA on various aspects of Section 8.2, to be planned and
managed by the same foreign experts, for period of one month. Assuming
the program will be in USA, the best places to visit will be (i) Southen
California (including the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts), for
water supply and pollution control, (ii) the Communicable Diseases Center
8 - 3



Waniiazhai Water Tansfer Priect                                 Final Reot
at Adanta, Georgia on disease control, and (iii) a branch of USEPA for
environmental constraints on construction.
(d) Class by selected faculty, held every six months for one year, each for 2
weeks, for officials of participating agencies (YRDP, provincial, local),
with say 20 trainees per clsaa each for Item 8.2.2, Item 8.2.3, Item
8.2.4/7.2.6(a), and 10 trainees for Items 8.2.1, 8.2.5, and 8.2.6 (b).
Figure 8-1 summarizes the recommended training program.
8.4 TRAINING PROGRAM COSTS
The esimated costs for training are shown in Figure 8-2.
8.5 VALUE OF TRAINMG PROGRAM
The proposed training program should prove to be one of the most cost-effective
components of the entire WWTP. Its total cost is small, only a very small percentage
of total first-phase investment cost, but this small investment is essential if the precious
imported water is to be wisely used. It is expected that the training program will result
in more appropriate planning decisions on proposal investments and thus result in
savings of tens of millions of dollars over the Phase I project design life period.
8.6   TEPB Training Program
In addition to the traiing program described above, another program is recommended
especially for strengthening the capabilities of TEPB, which is to be financed by a WB
technical assistance grant in the amount of S 2 million. This program is described in
detail in Annex H and is summarized here in Figure 8-3. This program for TEPB is
needed because TEPB is expected to have a major role for carrying out many of the
tasks involved in the recommnended integated water use/pollution control program.
The TEPB program supplements and complements the program described in Section
8.2.
8.7 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Implementation of WWTP will be a pioneering project for Shanxi Province (and for all
of China) in transbasin diversion of water on a massive scale, for meeting the critical
needs for more water to support continuing growth and development of parched areas
of northern China. Because of the restively high cost of such imported water, it is
essential that conventional practices on water use, waste treatment, water pollution
control, and water reuse be reoriented to achieve an integrated comprehensive
program which makes maximum/optimal use of the precious water for all essential
water uses in the service areas (raiyuan Service Area for Phase I) induding domestic,

institutional, legal, economic, and financing as well as engineering aspects.
In order to achieve this goal a specialized training program is needed to strengthen the
capabilities of the officials involved in WWTP including WWTP, Shanxi Province, and
Local Agencies, in the various new approaches and methodologies which will be
utilized. The program includes two components:
(a) A specialized training program to be an integral part of the WWTP/Phase I
project, described in the EIA Main Report Chapter 8, for training of selected
staff of participating Provincial and City agencies.
(b) A training program especially for TEPB, because of the many assignments for
which TEPB will have the lead role in preparinglimplementing the
recommended integrated plan, to be financed by Technical Assistance grant of
S 2 million (to be piggy-backed onto the WB Phase I Loan).

CHAPTER 9
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN (EMP)
9.1 INTRODUCTION
The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) comprises the institutional arrangements,
particularly the Environmental Management Office (EMO), which are designed to
ensure that the negative environrmental effects of the project are minimized and offset,
and that opportunities for enhancement are maximized wherever possible.
The approach to environmental management includes implementation of the EMP
under the direction of the EMO and with the assistance of various professional and
technical units and of a group of Chinese and international consultants. The main
aspects of the approach in the various projects stages (preconstruction, construction,
and operation) are summarized below.
Experience in using EIA process in developing countries has shown that, even if EIA is
well done and officially accepted, it does not necessarily follow that the Environrmental
Protection Measures (EPMs) included in the EIA will actually be implemented. For
this reason, it is absolutely critical that funding for the EMP/EMO be included in the
project cost and that the loan be conditional on the implementation of the EPM.
9.2 EMP APPROACH
Under the laws and regulations for EIA in China, which are administered by NEPA and
the Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB), procedures have been evolved
over the past decade to ensure compliance with EIA requirements. Generally, this
work is done by the Project Proponent under the supervision of the Provincial EPB.
For a major project such as WWTP, the Project Proponent (YRCC) must prepare and
implement an Environmental Management Plan under the supervision and subject to
the approval of the NEPA. For this reason the EIA team's work has included a
number of visits with the NEPA Project Officer (Mr. Li Xin Min) at Beijing.
The approach used in the EMP to ensure compliance with the Envirorunental
Protection Measures (EPMs) specified in the EIA is illustrated in Figure 9-1 and
comprises the following elements:
(a)  Final design of the project, including contract documents, plans and
specifications must include the EPMs specified by the EIA.
(b)  Provisions for the construction stage must include environmental monitoring and
surveillance, as well as the usual construction supervision for engineering activities.
(c)  On completion of construction, a trial run or other appropriate testing will be
conducted to ensure that EPMs have been effectively implemented or prepared for.
(d)  Monitoring and reporting during the Operation Phase will be done to ensure that
the project is being operated in compliance with the measures intended to protect the

Waniiazhai WVater Transfer Proiect                              Final Renort
environment and to provide the feedback necessary to identify and correct residual
problems or to take advantage of enhancement opportunities.
(e)  The approval and support of pertinent officials will be gained so that the
necessary engineering or institutional correction measures can be carried out.
The Environmental Management Plan for WWTP includes provisions to carry out each
of these steps.   These provisions involve institutional development, funding
mechanisms, technical planning and programs, further studies into effects and
opportunities for enhancement of benefits, and training and technology transfer in
support of the activities required in the Plan.
The Plan that has been developed is considered to be compatible with both Chinese
and World Bank requirements.  Figure 6.3-1 identifies the important laws and
regulations that were considered in doing the EIA and preparing the EPMs and EMP.
The EMP itself fully addresses all requirements of Annex C to World Bank Operational
Directive 4.01 (1991) conceming environmental management planning.
9.3 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
9.3.1 Environmental Management Administration
To ensure effective administration of environmental management, the YRDP will
create the Environmental Management Lead Group (EMLG) and Environmental
Management Office (EMO), whose combined responsibility is the administration and
implementation of the EMP. The Lead Group will be comprised of senior officials of
the YRDP, the provincial environmental agencies, and the other agencies that will have
responsibilities for undertaking specific environmental management tasks. This Group
will develop the necessary institutional arrangements and provide the necessary
authority to implement the specific EPMs.
The Environmental Management Office (EMO) will be responsible for the technical
planning and implementation of the functions noted in Section 9.2. Some of the actual
work may be delegated to and carried out by other agencies and units, such as the
various divisions of YRDP, Provincial and Local Governments, universities and
consultants. The EMO will coordinate the planning, surveillance and monitoring of all
EPM activities, and will itself set objectives and evaluate performances. The reportin,
function of the EMO will be of critical importance to the Lead Group and oth
interested agencies including NEPA and the World Bank.
9.3.2 Environmental Management Activities
9.3.2.1    Project Preparation Phase
During preparation for construction, the EM? priorities will be:
(a) To finalize the institutional arrangement and create the new ag'
relationships.
(b) To prepare environmentally related clauses for the tender doc
to ensure that the results of the EIA are included in the final
9 - 2



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final Report
design documents related to the project, including the environmnental
constraints to be observed by the Construction Contractor.
(c) To initiate the environmental monitoring program described in Chapter 7,
including environmental monitoring of resettlement.
(d) To commence the mobilization of various agencies responsible for
implementing EPMs as described in Chapter 4 and 5, including the
recommended permit system for water use and waste management
including treatment and reuse.
(e) To initiate the Environmental Training Program described in Chapter 8.
(f) To plan and initiate a comprehensive Public Participation program as
required by Chinese law.
9.3.2.2    Construction and Operation Phases
The major priorities during project construction phase will be: (i) monitoring of
construction operation, (ii) completion of the Enviromnental Training Program (if not
completed in the project preparation phase), (iii) continuing of the Public Participation
program and (iv) working with provincial and local agencies to assist the
implementation.
The Operation Phase will (i) continue the environmnental monitoring program, (ii)
continue the Public Participation program, and (iii) cooperation with provincial and
local agencies in carrying out all necessary EPMs.
In both the Construction Phase and Operation Phases, the EMO will observe the actual
environmental effects of the project. In the event there are unacceptable adverse
effects, or promising opportunities for environmental enhancement that have been
overlooked, it will be possible to recommend appropriate action.
9.3.2.3    Wanjiazhai Reservoir
The scope of work of the EMO and of the Expert Paul will include periodic review of
programs made by the Wanjiazhai Reservoir EMO is implementing the EPMs specified
in the EIA for Wanjiazhai.
9.4 PROJECT TIME FRAME
Figure 9-1 shows the time frame for completing Phase I of WWTP. As presently
planned, the WB Loan Agreement will be approved Feb. 1997, and pre-construction
planning for project components to be built will be completed by the end of 1996.
Construction is expected to take place over the 5-year 1997-2001
9.5 SUMMARIZED EMO/EMP PROGRAM
Figure 9-2 summarizes the total EMO program for administering implementation of
EMP, and Figure 9-3 shows the estimated costs. Figure 9-4 shows the estimated total
environmental management costs.

Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final Report
9.6 ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION FOR EMO
The total investment for establishing the EMO and implementing environmental
protection measures, shown in Figure 94 is estimated at $ 4.593 million for a period
of 25.5 years, or about S 180,100 per year. Because most developing countries have
been allocating very little (if anything) for such purposes, at first glance the sum of $
180,100 per year may appear to be excessive.
To justify this investment, it is useful to refer to experience in the USA, where a great
deal of experience has been gained on appropriate costs for postconstruction
enviromnental follow-up activities including monitoring.  This experience has
developed a "rule of thumb" that the appropriate annual investment for environmental
follow-up should be about I percent of project capital costs up to S 100 million, with
the percentage reducing to around 0.5 percent for projects with capital costs of $ 1
billion or more. Applying this criterion to the WWTP/Phase I, the EMO annual cost of
S 180,100 is about 0.01 of I percent of total WWTPtPhase I investment cost.
Recognizing that USA monitoring and follow-up action represents a higher level than
needed in DCs, the recommnended level of S 180, 100 per year for environmental
maangement seems very appropriate.
9.7 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Establishment of the WWTP/EMO for implementing the EMP is absolutely essential
for ensuring the environmental integrity of WWTP and this EMO is to be started not
later than the WB Loan Agreement and sooner if possible.
Figures 9-1, 9-2, 9-3, and 94 describe the total EMO/EMP work program staffing and
estimated costs including (i) costs for administering the EMO, (ii) monitoring costs
during both construction and operation phases, and (iii) costs for training.
The total costs for the EMO/EMP program is estimated to be approximately $ 4.593
million, for a total period of 25.5 years including 0.5 years for pre-construction
activities, 5 years for construction, plus 20 years of operation. This averages about
$180,100 per year. This cost represents a very small percentage of the total Phase I
project cost, and is very much less than what is practiced in Westem countries for
similar projects. Experience in the Western countries has shown that the benefit/cost
ratio for this investment is very high because it ensures that the project will be
economically-cum-environnentally sound.therefore sustainable.

CHAPTER 10
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
10.1 EIA TEAM AND REPORT
The EIA has been carried out for YRDP by CIRP/Shanxi University with the
assistance of WB/EIA team mambers, over the period July 1995 through June 1996.
The EIA Main Report and the Executive Summary Report have been prepared in both
the Chinese version (to meet NEPA requirements) and the English version (to meet
World Bank requirements). Both versions use the same Table of Contents and are
essentially the same in substance.
10.2 WORK APPROACH BY EIA TEAM
The WWTP/EIA work has (a) reviewed all background documents, (b) met with the
various governmental agencies in Shanxi Province and Taiyuan City who are
concerned with the environmental impacts of WWTP including YRDP, (c) met with
NEPA's EIA officer at Beijing in charge of WWTP/EIA, (d) made a number of field
visits to selected project areas, (e) has had detailed discussions with the WBfYRDP
Mission members visiting at Taiyuan in October 1995 and April 1996, and (f)
discussed the EIA Interim Report with WB officials at Washington D.C. in November
1995.
10.3 MANAGEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
Figure 10-1 (same as Figure 4.15-1) summarizes the environmental impacts of WWTP.
It (i) lists all of the SEIs, (ii) quantities each in terms of potentials for adverse effects if
not controlled, of potentials for benefits with feasible controls, and of net effects with
these controls, (iii) shows the EPMs measures which must be taken as part of the
feasible control system, and (iv) shows the net environmental effects.
Figure 10-1 shows that, assuming proper implementation of EPMs by the EMO,
WWTP will achieve great environmental benefits with virtually no significant
environemntal losses. While inattention to the SEIs noted above could result in serious
adverse effects if not properly controlled, the EIA work, including judgment from
experience in other major water resource development projects in China and
elsewhere, indicates that it will be feasible and affordable to manage each issue, by use
of mitigation/offsetting/ enhancement measures, so that the net adverse environmental
effects of the project should be negligible with net very positive environmental benefits.
To achieve the goal noted above will require establishment of the EMO noted in
Section 9.5, especially for realizing the institutional measures needed for achieving
optimal use of the imported water. The technologies to be utilized for optimal water
use, with wastewater treatment used to produce reusable water, are well established in
the arid/semi-arid regions of the USA like Southern California, but are relatively new
for use in China. The goal of the training program is to transfer this technology to
10-1



Waniiazhai Water Transfer Proiect                                Final RevoLt
Shanxi Province. Moreover, the WWTP experience will be a very valuable guideline
for use throughout China in water shortage regions.
Figure 10-1 also shows that WWTP is sound from the point of view of risk
assessment. The only real risk for WWTP is the risk that WWTP might not be
implemented. WWTP is an absolute must for the economics and socio-economics of
the service area which cannot continue to develop without imported water. And while
the imported water will be used by municipalities and industries to become
"wastewaters", these wastewaters themselves will all be very valuable water for (i)
reuse by industry, (ii) for recharging of groundwater to gain more water suitable for
domestic use including drinking, and (iii) for irrigation. Thus the wastewaters actually
represent per se precious additional water supply. Figure 10-2 is a schematic drawing
showing the water supply/reuse plan.
10.4 XIAOLANGDI EXPERIENCE
Because conditions for the SEIs for WWTP are similar in many respects to the SEIs
for Xiaolangdi, the pioneering experience of the Xiaolangdi project in managing these
issues (including construction stage problems) furnishes very valuable guidelines for
WWTP/EIA purposes.
10.5 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN AND OFFICE
To achieve the goals noted above, including assurance of optimal use of the expensive
imported water, it is essential for YRDP to establish the EMO with responsibility for
implementing the EMP as described in Figure 8-4 of Chapter 8, including the
Monitoring Program shown in Figure 5.3-1 of Chapter 5 and the Training Program
shown in Figure 7-1 of Chapter 7.
An effective EMO should be established during the pre-construction period, as soon as
possible.
