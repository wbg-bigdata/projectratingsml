MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BOLIVIA
FOR A FINANCIAL MARKETS AND PENSION REFORM
TECHMCAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Bolivia for SDR 6.1 million, the equivalent of
US$ 9 million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a Financial
Markets and Pension Reform Technical Assistance project for the establishment of a strengthened
financial sector environment and institutional regulatory capacity in the areas of banking,
pension and securities operations, the reform of the pension system, and implementation of the
capitalization distribution program.
2.          Country Background. Bolivia has undertaken a far-reaching economic program
since 1985 aimed first at restoring price stability and thereafter seeking to structurally reform the
economy for sustainable growth. Reforms have been supported by a series of annual arrangements
under an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) of the IMF and by adjustment credits and
other assistance from IDA, IDB and bilateral donors. The new Govermment assumed office in
August 1993, with the pledge to reduce and rationalize the role of the state and to move the social
agenda forward. The centerpiece of the Government's program is the capitalization of six major
state-owned enterprises and the distribution of 50% of the shares of these enterprises to the Bolivian
population. This program is supported by the Capitalization Prograin Adjustment Credit (CPAC),
approved on July 6, 1995. CPAC will assist the Government in strengthening the enabling
environment so that private investment is forthcoming as the Government withdraws from these
sectors and spurs growth in an efficient manner.
3.          An integral part of the capitalization plan is the distribution of shares in capitalized
companies to Bolivians through privately managed deferred-distribution accounts. Such accounts
would be managed by pension funds which would also manage defined- contribution pension funds
and which would be regulated by a Superintendency of Pensions. A private bank/investment firm
will be contracted to have a Trustee in place to hold the shares until their distribution to
pension funds for their management. Integral to the reforms would also be measures the Government
will take to improve regulation of securities markets so as to create the foundation for transparent
and efficient secondary market trading of distributed shares and pension fund investments. Reform
of insurance regulation and supervision is planned, to improve mechanism for contractual savings
and coverage of risks faced by capitalized companies. These reforms are integrated into a strategy
for the development of long-term financial markets which the adjustment credit supports and which
would also be supported by this project.
4.          Achieving the objectives of private sector investment and sustained growth will require
clear and consistent signals to the private sector, adoption of the reforms supported by the CPAC and



2
development of regulations and the institutional capacity to implement these reforms. An umbrella
regulatory agency being established for telecommunications, hiydrocarbons, aviation and electricity
sectors is supported through otlher IDA technical assistance credits. The Financial Markets and
Pension Reform Technical Assistance Credit seeks to provide assistance to the Government of Bolivia
in the reforms components related to the financial sector. Specifically, the institutional capacity is
either very weak or the institutional framework has yet to be developed for operation and regulation
of pensions, securities and banking. Among the issues to be addressed are:
*      Pension fund supervision had been extremely weak under the system which has existed prior
to the pension reform  contemplated.  Moreover, no regulatory institutions yet exist to
supervise the proposed new private pension fund administrators (AFPs);
*      Securities market regulation is weak. Reforms contemplated in the proposed Securities Law
and those responsibilities emanating from the capitalization program and pensions reform
imply a large increase in the importance of the regulation and supervision of these markets;
*      The Superintendency of Banks is generally considered strong but needs further strengthening
to deal with an increasingly complex financial market and the fragility of parts of the
banking sector.
5.           Project Objectives. The project's main objectives are   the development of
regulations, norms, institution-building measures, and information systems connected with the
financial sector components of the CPAC, and support or creation of implementing regulatory
institutions. The project's objectives are to establish the institutional framework and capacity for
pension funds operation and regulation, the regulation and operating norms for securities markets,
and strong banking regulation and supervision. By linking the regulatory and legal frameworks
which span across the banking, securities, and pension sectors, the project also addresses broader
fimancial sector coordination issues. This will result in more effective integration of norms and their
regulatory execution, thus providing an internally consistent framework for instituting financial
sector policies via the new or strengthened regulatory agencies.
6.           Development of regulations to implement the revised legislation as well as a
sustainable institutional framework for supervision of long-term financial markets (including
pensions) is fundamental to providing a stable and transparent enabling environment conducive to
efficient resource mobilization for private investment. Further, better regulated contractual savings
mechanisms can enable the public to better provide for its retirement, death and disability. An
effective implementation capability in each of the reform areas addressed will be critical in Bolivia
where administration has often been weak. Project results will be reflected in the issuance and
approval of specified norms, the implementation of monitoring and inspection procedures supported
by institution-building measures in the target agencies, and the maintenance of sound legal and
administrative frameworks in order to ensure adherence to financial regulations in the banking,
securities, and pension areas.
7.           Project Description. Project components are: (i) establishment of the institutional
structure and information systems necessary for regulation and supervision of the proposed pension
and capitalization distribution systems (32%  of total project cost); (ii) improvement in securities
regulation, strengthening the institutional capacity of the Superintendency of Securities, and



3
improving information systems to regulate market activity (8% of total project cost); (iii)
establishment of a transparent and efficient process for the distribution of capitalized shares including
trustee and international bidding arrangements (50% of total project cost); and (iv) continue the
institutional strengthening of the Superintendency of Banks (10% of total project cost). The project
is expected to fund about 60 staff-years of local consultants and about 12 staff-years of foreign
consultants.
8.         Project Cost and Financing. The project cost is estimated at US$19.3 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$12.8 million equivalent (66%). The Credit
would finance US$ 9.0 million equivalent (47% of total project costs), including 43% of foreign
exchange costs and 55% of local costs. The remaining US$10.3 million would be financed by
Government, Superintendency of Banks, and CNV counterpart resources. IDA's share of foreign
exchange costs is reduced because of the Borrower's decision to use leasing and other sources
of financing for most of the informatics equipment. A breakdown of project costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A.  Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursement, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule C. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Bolivia are presented in Schedules D
and E, respectively. Some of the studies in the preparatory phase were financed by USAID, by the
SAC and by a Project Preparation Facility of US$ 2 million. A Japanese Grant for Y34,200,000 has
also been approved. IDA has worked closely with the IMF and IDB in all aspects of the project.
9.          Project Implementation.  The project would be a technical assistance facility
managed through a Project Coordination Unit established in the Ministry of Capitalization.
Procurement would be subject to Bank review procedures and disbursements would be made against
100% of the net-of-tax costs of local and foreign consultants, 100% of the net-of-tax expenses of
training, 100% of the CIF cost of imported goods and of the ex-factory cost of local goods and 84%
of the cost of locally-procured goods, and 100% of foreign expenditures and 84% of local
expenditures for service contracts. The implementation period of the Credit is expected to be 2.5
years, the same as the CPAC. The closing date is December 31, 1998. Performance under the
project will be measured against performance indicators presented in Schedule B.
10.        The Project Coordination Unit would be staffed by a coordinator and an assistant and
would be responsible for coordinating the requests from each of the implementing agencies: the
Ministry of Capitalization through the Secretariat of Pensions, the Superintendency of Pensions, and
the Secretariat of Capitalization; the CNV; and the Superintendency of Banks. The Project
Coordination Unit would work together with the Procurement Unit which is already established in
the Ministry of Capitalization by previous credits, to process all procurement requests of the project.
11.        Project Sustainability. The project seeks to assist in the development of strong,
sustainable Government institutions conducive to long-term private sector growth including the
Superintendencies of Pensions, Securities, and Banking. Recognizing that strong institutions require
years to develop, the project aims to initiate a process that will maintain itself well beyond the period
of the Credit. The following measures are aimed at encouraging sustainability: (i) as improved
leadership is exercised in each of the superintendencies, improved salary guidelines adopted over a
1-2 year period, and training undertaken, it is anticipated that a cadre of professionals will develop



4
that will sustain itself beyond the initial phase; (ii) sustainability will be sought through improved
operating procedures and manuals, and their implementation; (iii) as the pensions, insurance and
securities markets develop in accordance with the Capitalization and related reforms, increasing
numbers of public stakeholders brought into those markets, will exert influence upon Government
officials to maintain professional regulation and supervision; and (iv) the self-funding mechanisms in
each of the superintendencies (e.g.: via charges/assessments to client institutions) will motivate
sustainability as the recipients of such regulation will exercise pressure for responsive and cost-
effective services.
12.         Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement. The project has been designed to
take into account the experience of IDA technical assistance operations in Bolivia as well as the
experience of financial market projects of this nature elsewhere. IDA-wide experience suggests that:
(i) regulatory reform  and institutional strengthening need to be supported by an adequate
macroeconomic policy environment; (ii) operations should be designed within a broad sectoral
context, including a medium-term strategy; (iii) project design should include a realistic assessment
of the counterpart's project implementation capacity; (iv) technical assistance design should be
preceded by careful analysis of institutional factors, including Borrower commitmnent; (v) Borrowers
should be closely involved from the earliest phases of preparation; (vi) projects should be focused
and limited in breadth and size so as to facilitate achievable objectives; (vii) projects should have
well-defined loan administration/financing arrangements; and (viii) projects should include verifiable
indicators of performance.
13.         The issues above have been addressed as follows: (i) the project is supported by
macroeconomic policy conditions specified in the CPAC and IMF ESAF; (ii) the operation has been
designed in a sectoral context, including an ongoing assessment of financial sector development
objectives and a Country Assistance Strategy; (iii) credit administration/financing arrangements have
been defined and agreed-upon with the Borrower to overcome limited counterpart project
implementation capacity; (iv) the project concept mas jointly developed by IDA and Government
authorities after analysis of the objectives and constraints to financial market development; (v) the
Borrower has had the main responsibility for project objectives and design from initial project
identification and the project has the full support of Government officials at the highest level; (vi)
the project is limited in scope and size to perform focused implementation; and (vii) a detailed
implementation plan has been agreed-upon.
14.         Technical assistance components have been included in most of the credits made to
Bolivia since 1986. Country-specific lessons stand out from the experience of technical assistance to
the financial sector in Bolivia, including two IDA adjustment credits and a USAID-supported
technical assistance project. These include the importance of the following: (i) a clear objective in
the policy measures and institutional strengthening; (ii) strong legal authority, decision-making and
budgetary autonomy of regulatory institutions as a prerequisite before they can fully develop their
institutional capacity; (iii) sustained budgetary support or self-sustaining funding sources for
regulatory institutions to ensure sustainability; (iv) transparent procedures to attract qualified staff
through proper examinations, promotion criteria and competitive salaries; and (v) adequate
computer equipment (including integrated mainframe oversight systems) to the consolidation and
integration of sectoral data as well as to use the analytical capabilities of staff to their fullest.

15.         Lessons from credit administration in Bolivia have also been addressed: Delays have
been experienced in procuring goods and services because of weaknesses in the project unit, the
procurement organization, and/or the payment system. This project will aim to remedy this through
the staffing and operational guidelines of the project unit, and through close supervision, including
use of local staff in the Resident Mission. While problems have been experienced in some projects
with the prompt delivery of audit reports, holding the audit firm accountable directly to the project
unit and IDA has largely resulted in remedying this difficulty.
16.         Rationale for IDA  Involvement. The project is consistent with the   Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) presented to the Board on February 8, 1994, that had as its cornerstones
second generation reforms to restructure and redirect the role of the state and a reform of the
country's education system. The CAS specifically identifies a lending program whereby IDA would
assist in strengthening essential public institutions--in particular those relating to Social Security
reform that are the project's main focus. Further, support of mechanisms for the distribution system
of the Capitalization Program will be critical to the CAS objective of broadening the benefits of
economic growth. The Government has assigned this project a high priority because it is crucial
for the success of Bolivia's Capitalization program.
17.         IDA provides a unique and catalytic function through its support of reforms of the
policy environment and the linkage between these reforms and the institutional capacity to
implement them. Moreover, IDA offers important institutional experience (in accordance with the
CPAC) in pensions reform and in capital markets development in Bolivia and elsewhere.
18.         Agreed Actions. During negotiations agreement was reached on: i) consulting,
equipment, training needs and financing plan of the Project (as described in the Technical Annex),
including financing mechanisms (including budgetary transfers) to satisfy counterpart financing
requirements for the period of the Credit for the CNV, and the Superintendency of Pensions; (ii)
terms of reference in the form of a matrix of key project activities, including objectives, outputs,
timetable, implementation plan, and performance indicators; and (iii) in addition to meeting all
financial reporting requirements, a full progress report will be prepared and submitted to IDA every
six months.
19.         Credit effectiveness is conditioned on: (i) the appointment of a head of the project
unit; and (ii) issuance of a report by the Government providing greater clarity as to the
characteristics of the deferred share distribution system, and (iii) signing of the Subsidiary
Agreements by the CNV and the SBEF.
20.         Conditions of disbursement for specific components of the credit are as follows: i)
expenditures by Superintendency of Pensions component, that require creating the Superintendency
of Pensions; ii) expenditures to draft new securities regulations, that require a legal framework for
the securities market, satisfactory to IDA; and iii) expenditures to draft new Banking Law
regulations, that require a legal framework for the Central Bank, satisfactory to IDA.

21.         Envirommental Aspects. Environmental category C. The project is not expected to
have any direct environmental impact.
22.         Program  Objective Categories. The project, supported by policy reforms, would
primarily contribute to the private sector development and economic management categories. While
this project does not have poverty alleviation as its direct target, the deferred share distribution
mechanism supported by the project could create a new old-age source of income for the majority of
Bolivia's population that has no access to retirement benefits.
23.          Participatory Approach. To ensure participation and ownership of the project
by the executing entities and beneficiaries, several actions have been taken as part of the project
implementation strategy including: (i) a public awareness campaign with respect to pension
reform issues and to evoke public participation, (ii) ensuring utilization of local skills in most
project components, both for cost-effectiveness reasons as well as to promote long-term
sustainability, (iii) involving the Borrower in developing incentive mechanisms to retain local
staff once they have taken up responsibilities for managing specified project components, and
(iv) including a structured training component managed by supervisors under the respective
project components, in order to assure ownership and establish sustainable functions to be
executed by local staff.
24.         Project Benefits and Risks. Given the weak administrative capacity of the
Government, the principal benefit of this project would be the initiation of a process for development
of a sustainable institutional capacity for efficient regulation and supervision of financial markets.
This increased capacity should in turn lead to the growth of the financial sector, better allocation of
resources and economic growth. The project's institution building features make it not amenable to
the calculation of rates of return. Measurement of benefits would be through assessment of: (i) the
efficiency and transparency of the respective financial markets regulated; (ii) the solvency of
financial intermediaries including banks, pension funds, and securities brokers, dealers, agents and
underwriters; and (iii) the growth of the depth of insurance, pensions and securities markets. The
latter will also be heavily dependent upon factors such as macroeconomic stability and management
beyond the scope of specific measures supported by the Credit. The proposed project design is
estimated to present the least cost solution for the achievement of the project's objectives because of
its reliance on existing capacity and local skills.  In light of the large implications that the
capitalization and the pension reform process will have on the financial sector and Bolivia's
development, the proposed project is just supporting the minimal steps that need to be undertaken
for the success of the reforms. The project will have a formal semi-annual review process of: (i)
continued counterpart commitment in each of the components of the projects, including institutional
authority, budgetary support, and (ii) institutional effectiveness in light of the level of support
provided.
25.         Principal project risks are: (i) the Government may fail to continue its adherence to a
strong macroeconomic program required, or financing of the costs of the transition to the new
pension system may not be available leading to fiscal problems so that the impact of institutional
reform measures becomes overshadowed and handicapped by macroeconomic instability; (ii) the
Government may not undertake the policy reform measures supported by the CPAC, in particular,



7
passage of the Pension Law mnay be delayed, or may stagnate in the future implementation of such
measures, and thus the technical assistance will not have the desired impact; and (iii) the
Government may not fully support the institution building measures required, including those
supported by the credit, because of insufficient commitment as shown in staffmg or providing other
resources, especially counterpart funds. For example, successful reform of insurance regulation and
supervision that the Government is undertaking without IDA assistance, is critical for the pension
benefits. Problems in this area could lead to weak results and threaten the sustainability of impact.
This project will only assist in the beginning stages of the process, but the passage of financial sector
and pension legislation and regulations as well as including independent sources of financing from
the sector for the regulatory agencies should help lessen these risks. Risks are further reduced by a
project design that is tied to the CPAC conditionality and that provides for self-funding mechanisms
in the institutions supported. Recent successful privatization of public enterprises are indications that
the Government's commitment to the reform process continues to be strong.
26.         Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
