MEXICO
TRADE POLICY LOAN
Loan and Project Sum_ary
Borrower:      Banco Nacional de Comercio Exter ,or, S.N.C.
Guarantor:     United Mexican States
ABONnt:         US$500.0 million equivalent
Terms:          15 years, including three years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate
Project
Description:   The proposed loan would support the Government's long-term
objective of gradually opening the Mexican economy through
implementation of trade reforms, as a means of improving domes-
tic efficiency and international competitiveness. The loan may
be seen as part of a larger program of Bank financial and tech-
nical support for Mexico's 1986-88 trade liberalization program,
including one or two possible follow-up Trade Policy Loans
(TPLs), a follow-up Export Development Project, and one or more
possible industrial reconversion projects to assist both private
and public sector firms in their adjustment to a more open trade
policy environment. The proposed loan would also serve to
assist Mexico in obtaining associated external financing from
commercial banks and other sources. Specifically, this loan
vould support the reduction of Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBa), which
have historically constituted the heart of the Mexican system of
protection and the simplification and reduced dispersion of
tariffs. The loan would finance part of the additional imports
resulting from the removal of NTBs. After an adjustment period
which will include further import liberalization measures,
additional non-oil export growth resulting from the trade policy
reforms should more than compensate for the additional imports.
The benefits of the program would be an improvement in the
balance of payments, the gradual recovery of sustainable growth
and employment based on productivity and efficiency gains, and
the strengthening of external confidence and creditworthiness.
Project
Risks:         A primary risk of the project relates to the danger of a macro
policy framework inconsistent with a gradual and sustainable
opening of the economy. A second major risk is the danger that
NTBs will not be reduced sufficiently quickly to establish the
full credibility of the three-year tariff reduction program.
- v -



The existence of still pervasive NTIs could disturb the incen-
tive effects of the tariff regime and weaken the inducement on
the part of producers to adjust to a more economy-policy envi-
ronment, Other risks relate to the length and difficulty of the
adjustment process; domestic pressures against the conitinued
implementation of the trade policy reform program; delays in
implementing complementary reforms in areas such as agriculture,
the parastatal sector, and the financial system; and uncertain-
ties In the external environment. These risks are reduced by
the Government's strong commitment to trade policy reform, as
demonstrated by the significant reductions in quantitative
import restrictions in 1985. Mexico's decision to seek GATT
membership and to negotiate a new program with the IMF also
reduces the risk of incomplete implementation of trade policy
reforms or backsliding. There is also a risk that effectiveness
of the loan may be delayed because of continuing uncertainty
about the availability of sufficient net additional external
financing for 1986 from other sources.
Eatimated
Disbursemeuts:       The loan would be disbursed in two tranches.  The first
tranche of US$300 million would be available for disburse-
ment at the time of loan effectiveness, including receipt
by the Bank of satisfactory assurances that an appropriate
financing package will be obtained from other lenders,
including commercial banks and export credit agencies. The
second tranche of US$189 million would be available upon
fulfillment of conditions for second tranche release, which
include the further reduction of NTBs by a minimum of 5% as
measured by the coverage of domestic production. If the
latter condition is not met by December 31, 1986, the
second tranche will be cancelled, unless otherwise agreed
between the Bank and Mexico. Disbursements of the entire
loan, including US$3 million for technical studies and US$8
million for the establishment of a modern antidumping
system, would be completed before November 30, 1988.

TO THE EECUTIVE DIR ORS 01
A PROPOSED LOAN TO BMCO NhCIONALDE CMODECW  EXTERIOR, S.N.C.
WITr lTHE WUARNTEE OF UNITED  XXICAI STATES
FOR A TRADE POLICY WAN
1.     I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Banco Nacional de Coinercio Exterior, S.N.C. (BANCOMEXT), with the guarantee of
United Mexican States, for the equivalent of US$500 million, in support of the
Government's program of trade policy reform. The loan would be repaid over 15
years, including 3 years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate.
PART I - TS ECONOMY UNTIL TEe CRISIS 0 1982
2.      An economic report, entitled "Mexico: Recent Economic Developments and
Prospects," was issued May 7, 1984 (4996-ME). A new Country Economic Memoran-
dum is scheduled to be issued by August 1986.   Country data are provided in
Annex I.
A.     INTRODUCTION
3.      The growth performance of Mexico over the three decades after 1950 is
among the best in the Western Hemisphere, at an annual average GDP growth rate
of 6.4%. But these averages obscure the Increasingly costly and unsustainable
growth strategies pursued and the rising instability of the Mexican economy
over the period. Shortly after World War II, Mexico adopted an import-substi-
tution strategy to industrialize a largely rural economy.   Between 1940 and
1970, agriculture's share in the economy fell from 212 to 11%, while industry's
grew from 25% to 34%.  Protection of new i1tdustries was intended to be tempo-
rary, but instead protection continually inc:eased and left the Mexican economy
unable  to compete in world trade.   The loris of competitiveness was further
aggravated after the oil boom of the 1970s.
B      DIFOIT-SUBSTITJTINC INDUSTEIALIZAIION, 1947-70
4.     During nearly two decades, between 1947 and the mid-1960s, increasingly
protected domestic markets provided a stimulus to private sector investment
and growth. The public sector retained a relatively modest share in economic
activity--on average about 15% of GDP (Figure 1)--awarding diverse incentives.
usually on a discretionary basis, to private investment. Through high Import
tariffs and a complex system of import licensing, domestic Industry was
protected from competition from imports--theoretically as a "temporary" support
for "infant industries," although in practice indefinitely.  Monetary and ex-
change rate stability further supported financial deepening and growth.
5.     By the late 1960s, the relatively easy and efficient opportunities for
import substitution had been exhausted. With the rising anti-export bias ema-
nating from the trade regime, Mexico's share in world exports had declined

steadily from 0.9Z in 1948-50 to 0.5% by 1968-70 (Figure 2).   With seports
declining rapidly as a share of GDP (Figure 3), preferential imports of needed
capital goods and raw materials generated chronic trade deficits. The bias in
favor of local manufacturing was compounded by the provision of cheap capital
imports, cheap energy, and other public utility inputs.  These policies were
heavily biased against labor and labor-intensive sectors, in a country whose
population was growing at an annual rate of over 32 during the 1960s and where
a large proportion  of people was  (and  is)  living  in poverty.   Increasing
unemployment, formal or unrecorded, was one result; very low wages for
non-governmental and non-union labor, another; and large-scale outmigration,
yet another.

6o.    Mexico faced a strategic policy choice in the late 1960s between movlng
to an internationally-competitive growth path, or deepening its commitment to
inward-oriented development. A gradual opening of the economy would at that
tilme have been possible at limited cost because import substitution had been
focussed primarily on consumer goods, In which Mexico could have readily
achieved international competitiveness.  But Mexico's import-substituting pri-
vate sector (including foreign-owned Eirms producing for the domestic market)
refused to be deprived of lts captive domestic market. arguing successfully
that reduction of protectionlot barriers would destroy local lndustry. A large
Government bureaucracy similarly opposed the elimination of discretionary con-
trols on  foreign  trade.   Mexico  twice--in 1971-72 and  again  in  1977-78--
attempted and then reversed trade llberalizatlon programs.  For the 15 years
from 1970 to 1985, Mexico thus postponed needed structural reforms and opted
instead for a deepening of its protectionist and inward-looking development
path.

and  extended  down  the chain of  production  to many  Intermediate  and capital
goods, for which Mexico did not have the domestic market scale necessary to
achieve efficient productlon without exporting.  Mexico conceived of Itself Am
one of the largest economies in the developing world, ignoring the fact that,
in terms of effective purchasing power, its internal market was no larger than
that of London or Los Angeles.   Mexico's effective market size for non-petro-
leum-related  industrial products 1s less than  one-tenth of that of countries
such as France or Germany, which rely on International specialliation to ensure
efficient  production;  yet  Mexico  progressively  Isolated  itself  from  world
markets, with non-oil exports declining steadily to less than 32 of CDP by 1980
(Figure 3).  This is one of the lowest export-GDP ratios of any economy in the
world--lndustrialized or developing (Table 1)--and It made the Mexican economy
unusually vulnerable to external sector shocks.

8.     In the absence of productivity gains since the late 1960's, growth since
1970 has been contrived, first via public expenditure-led growth (1971-76),
financed largely through foreign borrowing, and subsequently (1978-82) via
booming oil revenues and additional foreign borrowing, made possible by the
prospect of future income from oil.  By the time both of these options had been
exhausted, Mexico by the mid-1980. faced an external imbalance touch greater
than that of 1970, an incentive regime much more severely distorted, and an
economy  even  less  able  to compete  internationally.   The  recent collapse  in
world oil prices now creates an imperative for Mexico to move forward urgently
with the structural reforms that have been postponed since the late 1960a.
These reforms are dictated not primarily by the fall in oil prices--because
Mexico can continue to produce oil profitably at prices even below those cur-
rently prevailing in world markets (about US$12-$14 per barrel) nor are they
dictated by Mexico's need to service the interest on its foreign debt, which
continues to be payable in its entirety out of net PEMEX export revetiues alone
(thus leaving the net balance approximately unchanged vis-a-vis the payments
situation prior to the surge in foreign borrowing after the late 1970s).
Rather,  they  are  dictated  by  the  need  to  recover  productivity  growth  and
employment.

9.       Fortunately, Mexico has a record of remarkable export responsiveness
whenever exchange rate and other policies have been appropriate.  For example,
between 1970 and 1973, manufactured exports (including net exports of the in-
bond sector) increased from US$444 million to US$1,313 million--a real annual
growth of 34%.   Again,  between 1976 and 1979, overall manufactured exports
increased from US$2.0 billion to US$3.4 billion, for a real annual growth rate
of 8%.  Most recently,  in the period 1982-1985, overall manufactured exports
rose from US$3.9 billion to US$6.4 billion, despite some decline in 1985, for
an average annual growth rate of 15% in real terms.   Moreover, the in-bond
sector--which benefits from a relatively unencumbered free-trade status--has
had an impressive growth performance over the years, despite increasing insta-
bility oE exchange rate and other policies. Between 1970 and 1982, net exports
of the in-bond sector alone rose from US$83 million to US$851 million, and
since 1982 these have risen by a further 55% to US$1.3 billion. Employment in
the in-bond sector has grown rapidly since 1982, far outstripping the overall
rate of employment growth in the economy as a whole.  In response to the large
real devaluation of the Mexican peso since mid-1985 (Figure 4), non-oil exports
are again booming, up by 20% in real terms during the first four months of 1986
over the like period of 1985.
C.     PUBLIC EZPENDITURE-LED GROWTH, 1971-1976
10.     Protect.on from foreign competition and the confinement of production
primarily to domestic markets, not only prevented industry from gaining in pro-
ductivity and the efficiency to compete abroad, but also penalized the primary
sectors (especially agriculture and mining) that had previously been export-
oriented, by skewing incentives and drawing private sectur resources away from
these sectors.  Virtually all sectors became increasingly dependent on fiscal
incentives, subsidized input prices, preferential credit, and "buy Mexico"
procurement policies of the public sector.   By 1970,  federal non-oil taxes
accounted for an extremely low 7.6% of GDP (Figure 5), while subsidies and
transfer payments alone accounted for about 5% of GDP (Figure 6).   But the
private sector also resisted efforts to strengthen Government finances and to
increase taxes and social expenditures to provide for a rapidly growing
population.

11.     By 1971-72, both trade and tax reform initiatLves had failed, and the
Government embarked on a rapid expansion of public sector expenditure to ensure
continued economic growth and employment. The number of companies with Govern-
ment participatlon more than doubled, to 845, between 1970 and 1976. Parastat-
al enterprises expanded faster than the economy at large, relying increasingly
on transfers from the Federal Government budget.
12.    After years in which inflation in Mexico had closely followed trends in
world inflation, expansionary spending policies initiated a process of rising
inflation (Figure 7).  By 1975-76,  the consolidated public sector deficit had
reached nearly 10% of GDP (Figure 8), and inflation was in excess of 15%.
Financial  deepening  was  reversed  (Figure  9),  and  capital  flight  ensued
(Figure 10). Crowding out of the private sector in the domestic credit markets
intensified (Figure 11), despite the financing of the balance of payments
through rapidly growing foreign borrowing by the public sector (Figure 12).
The share of the public sector in GDP, which had remained below 20% prior to
1970, rose to 28% by 1976 (Figure 1).

13.     Basic incentive-regime distortions that were present before 1970 were
exacerbated by inflationary policies, an overvalued exchange rate, and negative
interest rates. Quantitative restrictions vere raised back to record new lev-
els (Figure 15). Mexico tbus incurred the combined effects of a long misdirec-
ted growth strategy and increasingly inappropriate macropolicy.  The economy's
long period of stab:lity and private sector confidence were undermined. Real
economic growth averaged 6.2X over the period 1970-76, but it was contrived in
an inward-oriented economy on the strength of an unsustainable rise in public
expenditure and foreign debt.
D.     GROWTH THROUGH OIL AND FOREIGN BORRnWILMGw 1977-1982
14.     Following the 1976 crisis, the Government undertook a combined program
of stabilization and trade liberalization.  There was a first phase to disman-
tle import controls by 1980, to be followed by a gradual lowering of tariffs.

There were renewed efforts at tax reform, protection reduction, and stimulation
of non-oil exports.  Mexico obtained a three-year facility from the IMF, and
negotiated a highly favorable pact for Mexico to enter GATT.  A second year of
slow growth in 1977 followed on major new oil discoveries (Figure 13), that
came to be seen as the means to finance a quick return to high growth, without
politically costly structural reforms. By 1978, no further drawings took place
under the IMF program; and two years later, under combined pressure from busi-
ness and labor, the Government decided against joining GATT.  Modest progress
in trade liberalization was reversed after 1980, with QRs rising quickly to new
highs by 1982 (Figure 15).

15.     Proven oil reserves boomed (Figure 13), and so did the world price of
oil (Figure 14). This double oil boom served as a lever for enlarged borrowing
to finance expanding public investment and other expenditures; and the Govern-
ment also encouraged private firms to seek foreign credits against Mexico's
prospect of future oil revenues.   Net external borrowing by the public sector
(Figure 12) totalled US$34.5 billion over the period 1979-82, compared to total
investment in the petroleum sector alone of some US$30 billion over the same
period.    Public  expenditure,  including  by  parastatal  enterprises,  nearly
doubled in real terms between 1977 and 1982, rising from 28% of GDP in 1976 to
a new high of 42.5% of GDP by 1982 (Figure 1).  The real exchange rate appre-
ciated by more than 25% (Figure 4), and the public external debt jumped to 30%
of GDP, from 18% in 1976.  Moreover, as domestic crowding out of the private
sector accelerated once again (Figure 11), the private sector's foreign debt
increased from US$4.9 billion in 1976 to US$20 billion by mid-1982.
16.     Real growth averaged a high 6.1% again during the period 1976-82.  But
growth and investment patterns, financed by oil and foreign debt, moved Mexico
still further away from its international comparative advantages, thus deep-
ening the structural misdirection of the economy that began in the late 1940s.
Large-scale public and private investments with low international rates of
return, such as steel and many capital goods, were undertaken or encouraged

behind high and rising effective protection barriers (Annex VII).  To offset
the growing inefficiencies and rigidities of a protected economy, an ever
increaeing share of resources went into subsidies of all kinds--up from the
aforementioned  5% of GDP in  1970 to 8.5%  by  1980  (Figure  6).   Overall
subsidies, measured on an economic rather than a purely budgetary basis,
reached 14% of GDP by 1980 (Table 2).

17.    The fiscal deficit reached 14.72 of GDP in 1981, and 17.6% by 1982.  The
Government devalued in 1982 by 268Z in nominal terms; nationalized the banking
system and 467 bank-owned firms; imposed foreign exchange controls and forcible
conversion of 'Mex-dollar" deposits; and suspended principal payments on the
US$60 billion foreign debt. Capital flight over the period 1976-82 is estimat-
ed to have reached a cumulative total of US$29 billion (Figure 10); and the
size of the domestic financial system bad by 1982 reached a new post-1977 low
(Figure 9).   Non-oil export shares  fell  to new lows during  this  period
(Figure 3), as did foreign reserve levels (Figure 16). Quantitative restric-
tions (QRs) were extended to 100% of imports.  The crisis of 1982 resulted
essentially from fiscal overexpansion in an economy with a severely repressed
export capability.

an unprecedented new low in real terms (Figure 4).   Import controls had been
tightened before the program with the Fund was started. The program called for
a dismantling of those controls, a process that war to be initiated after the
devaluation of Decpmber 1982.   Public secLor expenditure  in relation to GDP
declined over the period 1983-85, from the high of 42.52 in 1982 to about 332
by 1985 (Figure 1).  Won-interest expenditure declined to about 222 of GDP by
1985, a 10-year low (Figure 17).  Public sector investment was cut from about
82 of GDP in the late 1970s to only 52, again a 10-year low (Figure 18).  Non-
interest current expenditure also declined, though more modestly, and remained
still at the levels of the late 1970s.  Real wages fell 252-352 between 1982
and 1984 (Figure 19).   Most public sector prices were raied  in real  terms.
Public sector savings, adjusted for the inflation component of intsrest pay-
ments, reached record highs (Figure 20), and similarly adjusted deficits
reached new lows (Figure 21).  Monetary growth of domestic origin became con-
tractionary (Figure 22), allowing the foreign reserve cover for the monetary
base to recover its level of the mid-1970s, albeit a level still well below
those observed during the period of monetary stability prior to 1970 (Figure
16).
19.      The results of the stabilization effort for 1983-84 were  impressive.
Imports fell 222, non-oil exports rDse 622, and the resource balance showvd
enormous and unprecedented  surpluses  in 1983-84  (Figure 23),  reflecting  the
high  surplus  in  the  "primary"  (non-interest)  fiscal accounts  (Figure 27).
Despite declining oil prices, net foreign reserves increased from a negative
US$2.0 billion to US$6.5 billion between the end of 1982 and the end oE 1984.
The 1983-84 performance was hailed by the international financial community as
a model for other countries.  A massive foreign debt restructuring was success-
fully negotiated.  Total net foreign borrowing for the three-year period 1983-
85 amounted to US$4 billion, for an actual decline in the overall debt, in real
terms, of about 1%.  The EFF, which had been framed in a medium-term context,
called for important structural reforms, including a reduction of the size of
the public sector and the liberalization of the exchange and trade regimes.
But, unfortunately, the implementation of the liberalization effort was very
slow during 1983-84.   The optimistic reaction to Nexico's success in 1983-84
overLooked the short-term emphasis of the stabilization effort and the slowness
in implementing  long overdue structural reforms.   Optimism turned  to dispn-
chantment 18 months later, and external creditors came to recognize that sta-
bilization in the absence of more fundamental structural reEorms could not
restore Mexico's former levels of creditworthiness nor would sustainable
economic growth be possible without suchi reforms.

20.     Growth throuLh Internal BorrwXLi.  Despite drastic fiscal and monetary
contraction, inflation in both 1983 and 1984 turned out to be much higher than
had been projected by the authorities and assumed in the IMF program. The fis-
cal deficit fell substantially in 1983 (to 8.5% of GDP), but then levelled off
in 1984. GDP fell in both 1982 and 1983, and recovered only partially in 1984
(Figure 24). Consumption per capita by 1984 remained below the levels of 1980
(Figure 25), as the Government prepared for the mid-term Congressional elec-
tions of July 1985.   By late 1984,  fiscal policy began to ease, and public
sector borrowing incroased substantially. Monetary policy turned less restric-
tive, the exchange rate once again appreciated in real terms (see Figure 4),
and relatively small deviations from the program led to a renewed surge of
inflation. The recovery of private sector investment was affected by uncer-
tainties over the handling of the external debt that had been accumulated by
the private sector in the period 1978-82 and by the delays in removing exchange
and trade restrictions.  With the introduction of a new scheme to restructure
the private sector external debt (FICORCA), the situation improved, and by
mid-1984 there was a stronger-than-expected recovery of the private sector.
21.     Most program targets were missed in 1985.  The fiscal deficit rose to
9.8%; inflation increased to 63.8%; non-oil exports duclined from their 1984
levels; and most components of the balance of payments deteriorated.   Foreign
reserves  declined  by  nearly  US$3.5  billion.    While  external  public  debt
declined  in real terms during 1985,  the domestic debt of the public sector
surged back up toward the level of 1982 (Figure 26). As a result, crowding out
of the private sector in the domestic credit markets was severe, as the share
of the public sector in total credit reached an unprecedented high in excess of
75% in 1985 (Figure 11).  The brief spurt of GDP growth between mid-1984 and
mid-1985 came quickly to a halt in late 1985, and prospects for 1986 are for
another decline in real GUP.

B.     EVALUATION OF THE 1983-85 POLICY PERFORMNCE
22.     An Inappropriate Policy Mix.  The failure of the 1985 program has se-
verely undermined the confidence at home and abroad that was returning during
the 1983-84 period.  But considered more closely,  it is clear that the failure
of the 1983-85 stabilization program was due not primarily to a lack of effort
on the macropolicy side, but to an inappropriate mix of aggressive demand-
management policies and very slow progress in the Government's original plans
to move simultaneously in expanding aggregate supply through improvements in
the productivity and efficiency of the economy.  The lack of structural reform,
particularly the failure to liberalize trade, left the economy bottled up
inside high protective barriers, vulnerable to wide swings in response to small
deviations of policy and without opportunities for growth on a sustainable
basis.
23.     The failure to move on trade liberalization worked in several ways to
frustrate the effects of contractionary macropolicy throughout the period 1983-
85. The stabilization effort was itself faulty for not explicitly recognizing
that the macro policy and inflation targets could not be met without the imple-
mentation of congruent structural measures envisioned in the original program,
especially trade liberalization, and for not recognizing the unusual sensi-
tivity of the budget and other variables to excess inflation.  Mexico, unlike
many other Latin American countries, has had limited experience vith high
inflation.   It was,  therefore,  a central objective of policy over the past
three years to return to low inflation and resist all forms of indexation--of
wages, interest rates, public pricing, the exchange rate--as potentially desta-
bilizing. But the failure to move decisively to free the system from trade and
exchange restrictions reduced the effectiveness of the efforts to reduce
inflation.   With continued high levels of trade restrictiveness,  the economy
remained vulnerable to small errors in macro policy, and the relaxation of the
adjustment effort in 1985 resulted in a resurgence of inflationary pressures.
24.     The massive 50% devaluation of the real exchange rate in 1982-83 might
have been consistent and tenable with a full and immediate elimination of
import barriers.   But import controls were not sufficiently relaxed  in that
period, contrary to original intentions.  Thus, the real exchange rate in the
period 1982-83 turned out to be initially undervalued (Figure 4), and hence
inflationary,  even with a draconian fiscal effort.   The monetary authorities
could have targetted the real exchange rate and accepted whatever inflation
rate that might imply, or alternatively an even greater fiscal contraction.
But the presumption of the stabilization program was that inflation must and
would be brought down and that trade liberalization would proceed expeditiously
to support that objective.  The authorities recognized that an indexed "crawl"
might temporarily sustain the greatly undervalued exchange rate, but at the
risk of an explosive wage-inflation-devaluation spiral that would be politi-
cally untenable.
25.    Second, the fiscal targets were formulated and implemented on a consoli-
dated domestic and foreign currency basis, ill-suited to a closed economy in
which the flow of goods and services, at any given exchange rate, was con-
strained by high import restrictions, that led to a transformation problem.
The domestic monetization of the foreign currency surplus (Figure 27), to
finance part of the domestic currency deficit, created a claim on external



- 15 -
resources that could not translate readily into effective domestic aggregate
demand for imports, and was thus simply inflationary. The real rosource equiv-
alent of the foreign currency surplus was blocked by high import barriers and
the initially undervalued exchange rate of 1982-83.   In the absence of major
import liberalization in 1983-84, the only  feasible adjustment to effect the
real transfer of the foreign currency surplus was an appreciation of the real
exchange rate.   The monetary authorities correctly perceived  in 1983-84 that
maintaining a highly undervalued exchange rate in this environment would lead
to continued reserve accumulation and would only further accelerate Inflation.
The need for more effective fiscal and monetary management of Mexico's oil
revenues thus further accentuates the importance of trade liberalizat ion.
26.     The single factor that helps most to account for the disappointing out-
come in 1983-85, despite major domestic effort, is the large weight of interest
payments on the domestic public debt and other inflation-sensitive components
of public expenditure, such as pricing and interest rate subsidies (Figure 6).
Once the dynamics of excess inflation were in place, for the reasons discussed
in the previous paragraphs, the result was that these inflation-linked compo-
nents of public expenditure continually exceeded expectations and caused ex-
penditure overruns not directly subject  to public policy control.   Interest
payments on the domestic debt alone accounted for 6.3% of GDP, on average, over
the 1983-85 period.  The unforeseen excess-over-budget of these payments alone
accounts for most of the fiscal deficit overruns for the period. These higher
deficits meant higher nominal public borrowing requirements, even though the
operational and primary deficits were low by historical standards (Figures
26-36).
27.     The Failure of a Sustained zpgort Response.  The implementation in 1983
of a "free-trade status" for exporters, with the support of the World Bank in
the form of the first Export Development Project, substantially diminished the
anti-export bias of the trade regime, but the response of non-oil exports faded
after the 62% increase in the 1983-84  period.   As QRs rather than tariffs
provided the effective constraint on most imports, there was no ceiling on the
level of effective protection to domestic sales as against competition from
abroad.   Domestic prices of tradable goods rose even faster than the general
price level during most of the period 1983-85.   As domestic demand recovered
from the depressed levels of 1983, effective protection to domestic sales thus
rose pani passu, given that QRs rather than tariffs were the primary trade
policy instrument; and hence so did the resource pull away from export markets.
28.      Even though imports by exporters were free of both QRs and tariffs,
under the 1983 "free-trade regime" for exporters, domestic sales remained high-
ly protected and hence relatively more profitable during this period. In addi-
tion, the real exchange rate appreciation of 1984-85 (Figure 4) further eroded
the international competitiveness  of non-oil exports.   As a result of these
various factors, non-oil exports declined steadily after the first quarter of
1984, despite the implementation of the very liberal 1983 import regime for
exporters.
29.     The Failure to Strengthen Access to Voluntary Lending.  After its uni-
lateral decision to suspend payments on its external debt in 1982, Mexico in
the period 1983-85 obtained the largest debt restructuring ever undertaken (in

the amount of USD49 billion), on the *xpectation--uhared by the Government and
Its foreign creditors--that debt relief would enable Mexico to stabilize its
economy and bogin the dooper structural reforms needed in order for Mexico to
achieve sustainable long-term growth.  By late 1985, it war clear that little
progress had boon achieved in structural reforms and that Mexico haed not recov-
ered Che external creditworthinoes and confidence needed to return as planned
to voluntary landing by 1986. Mexico projected late In 1985 that it would face
large new financing requirements in 1986, even before the oil price decline of
early 1986, and it was not expected that theme would be met through a return to
normal voluntary commercial lending.   This already difficult outlook was fur-
ther aggravated by the fall in world oil prices and Mexico's loss of export
volume (primarily the result of uncompetitive pricing policiem).
Co     THE START OF GENERAL TRADE L  IRALUZATION:  1985 1/
30.    At the start of 1985 approximately 83% of imports and 100% of domestic
production were subject to QRs.  In early 1985, the Government announced its
lntention to reduce QRs to between 55Z and 652 of imports by the end of 1985.
That objective became part of the program agreed with the IMF. But only limit-
ed trade liberalizatLon was achleved In the first half of 1985, against strong
opposition in many parts of the private sector and the Administration.  How-
ever, a major bilateral trade accord was reached with tho United States, which
committed Mexico to phase out remaining export subsidies, in return for getting
a GATT-style  Injury clause  In the application of countervailing  duties on
Mexican exports to the U.S.
31.     Partly in response to the persistence of high inflation, the Government
on July 25 abruptly eliminated QRs from 3,604 tariff positions, out of a total
of 8,100.  This brought the ratio of controlled lmports down to 39X of import
value, the lowest level in a quarter century (Figure 4).  Nearly 45X of pro-
duction thus was freed.  The July 25 measures had a strong impact on expecta-
tions because of the unprecedented sweep and speed with which they were carried
out.   This contrasted markedly with the previous liberalizatlon attempts in
1970-71 and 1977-80 (see Part I), whlch had involved a very slow reduction of
QRs that became administratively unmanageable because it was discretionary and
lacked transparency, thus permitting Interest groups to exert pressure against
the removal of QRs.
32.     As part of the July 25 reforms, the authorities undertook a series of
adjustments in the structure of tariffs to avoid an abrupt and potentially dis-
ruptive shift in the level and structure of effective protection. Over several
decades, during which QRs had been the primary instrument of protection, tar-
iffs had been a relatively inactive and subsidiary instrument of protection.
The level and dispersion of tariffs were adjusted in response to the overvalua-
tion of the exchange rate prior to 1982 and were gradually lowered after 1983.
As part of the July 25 measures, average overall tariffs increased marginally
from 23.4% to 25.4%, while dispersion declined from 25.5% in 1984 to 18.91
after July 25, 1985 (Figure 31).

33.     Antidumplng protection, which had in the past been possible via the
direct use of QRs, became a matter of increased concern. During the first half
of 1985, the coverage of official import reference prices (ORPs) had been
reduced considerably from 1,348 tariff positions at end-1984, accounting for
10% of imports of that year, to 4.4% by July 1, 1985.  In the wake of the QR
reduction on July 25 and some minor additional QR reductions in the months
thereafter, the authorities once again expanded the use of ORPs as a defense
against dumping to 7.6% of 1984 imports. Present ORP coverage (as of April 30,
1986) has been reduced to 1,171 positions, representing 7.0% of 1984 imports.
The estimated equivalent of domestic production covered by ORPs is at present
about 17.5%,2/ of which about 5.0% is also covered by QRs.  At the same time,
the authorities submitted new antidumping legislation to Congress; indicated
that future antidumping policy would be based on GATT-style countervailing
duties rather than distortionary ORPs; and announced that all ORPs would be
phased out over a two-year transitional period and eliminated by end-1987.
34.    Mexico's Neigotations with CATT.  The dramatic liberalization of trade
on July 25 made it possible for Mexico to once again consider entry into GATT.
In November 1985, the Mexican Senate authorized President de la Madrid to ini-
tiate negotiations for Mexico's accession into GATT.   That same month Mexico
formally presented its application to GATT, receiving a very favorable initial
response.  Formal negotiations began in February 1986, and the Government hopes
that these will be concluded by September 1986 so that Mexico can participate
as a full member in the forthcoming new GATT round. As of mid-1986, it appears
that Mexico will successfully conclude its negotiations for accession on sched-
ule, and on terms that could possibly place Mexico in the front ranks of LDC
membership in GATT, as measured by its commitment to enter into early compli-
ance not only with the general principles of GATT but also with several of key
GATT codes to which many LDCs have not yet subscribed.
2/     The methodology developed for measuring the production-weighted coverage
of NTBs has been agreed to in the Memorandum on Methodology between the
Government and the Bank (Annex V).

PART III - THE SECOND PHASE OF ADJUSTMENT, 1986-88
A.     MEDIUM-TERN OBJECTIVES
35.    The Mexican authorities have recognized that a renewed demand-management
effort will be needed in 1986 to recover internal and external balance and move
on to a sustainable growth path by the late 19809 (see Annex IV). But in addi-
tion, beginning with the trade policy reforms of July 1985 and the decision to
seek entry into GATT, the Government has accelerated the implementation of the
original objectives of the comprehensive National Development Plan of 1982,
particularly that of a gradual opening of the economy.
36.     The medium-term prospects remain difficult.   The recently accelerated
decline in world oil prices will substantially reduce the Government's ability
to subsidize continued domestic inefficiency, thus requiring more decisive and
rapid structural adjustments.   The reduced margin of oil export revenue over
external interest payments implies that the attainment of an overall balance of
payments equilibrium and declining inflation will require determined efforts to
constrain domestic absorption, while gradually opening the economy over the
next  several years.   As already noted,  structural adjustments  are needed--
irrespective of the price of oil and the level of the debt service--in order
for Mexico to recover sustainable growth of income and employment through
productivity growth rather than subsidies.
37.    The change in the international oil market situation is having a signi-
ficant  impact on the Mexican economy in 1986.   Oil export earnings in 1985
represented about half of Mexico's total exports of goods and services, and
similarly about one-half of total public sector revenues. Each US$1 per barrel
drop in international oil prices can be expected to reduce Mexico's revenues by
about US$600 million, assuming no change in the volume of oil production and
exports.
B.     THE N&CEOPOLICY FRAHENORK FOR 1986-88
38.     The macropolicy framework and external financing plan for 1986-88 are
crucial to the viability of the trade liberalization process that would be sup-
ported by the proposed TPL. Throughout the Bank's discussions with the Govern-
ment regarding Mexico's plan to redirect the country's economic development
strategy toward outward-oriented growth--including the appraisal and negotia-
tion of the proposed TPL, there has been a shared understanding that an appro-
priate macro policy framework would be essential to achieve the objectives of
the loan. The credibility of the Bank's support for trade liberalization would
be at risk, just as would be that of the Government itself, if highly visible
commitments were to be made to trade liberalization without assurances of a
supportive structure of macro policy, in particular, fiscal, exchange rate, and
interest rate policies.   For this reason, the proposed TPL provides that nei-
ther tranche will be disbursed except as the Bank is satisfied that the macro
policy framework is consistent with the Government's trade liberalization
objectives.



- 20 -
39.      As discussed in Part II of this Report, Mexico undertook major macro
policy adjustments during the stabilization phase that followed the crisis of
1982.   The stabilization phase of 1983-84 was effective  in bringing about a
needed contraction in overall domestic absorption and in generating substantial
external surpluses (see Figure 23). But, as noted in Part II.B, the policy mix
was heavily skewed toward demand management and austerity measures, with only
slow progress In implementing the equally pressing structural reforms that
wouLd raise productivity and increase supply along with the contraction in
duiiiand. The result was a severe recession, a major decline in real wages, and
growing political pressures for a shift to m more expansionary macro policy,
even though underlying conditions of the economy still did not permit a
sustainable resumption of growth and employment.
40.    During the TPL appraisal and negotiation process, the Government's poli-
cy program for 1986-88 underwent a series of changes, partly in response to the
reemergence of fiscal imbalance and inflationary pressures in 1985 and to the
collapse of oil prices during early 1986.  The Bank's appraisal team undertook
extensive analysis of each new program, including the most recent one, as
refLected  in the Government's Statement of Foreign Trade Policy of June 19
(reproduced in Annex IV).  However, there were doubts as to whether the fiscal
effort implied in that Statement would be sufficient to forestall intensifica-
tion of inflationary pressures.   Moreover,  considering the Government's con-
tinued efforts to adjust to these adverse circumstances and its ongoing nego-
tiations with the IHF, the June 19 policy program may be revised further in the
coming weeks.   It is for this reason that no detailed analysis of the June 19
policy program is provided in this document.  At the time of Board presenta-
tion, the staff will provide to the Board an explanation and assessment of the
policy program as it will have evolved up to that date.
41.     The current economic situation,  despite significant fiscal effort and
adjustments of the exchange rate, interest rates, and credit policies, has
deteriorated seriously since the collapse of international oil prices in early
1986. Without continued domestic adjustments, particularly to reduce the fis-
cal deficit and reliance on foreign savings, the current Mexican recession
could turn into a prolonged crisis, cbaracterized by a deepening and widening
of poverty and increased risks of instability.
C.     STRUCTIRAL POLICY REFORMS
42.    Policy adjustments needed to recover sustainable growth over the medium
term include both trade liberalization and a number of other reforms. Many of
these were outlined in the Government's 1982 National Development Plan and
reaffirmed in the February 21 statement by President de la Madrid.  As noted
earlier, crucial trade policy reforms--to move Mexico from a now exhausted
inward-oriented growth path to sustainable outward-oriented growth--will create
opportunities for growth and employment based on Mexico's international compar-
ative advantages.   In the absence of such opportunities,  it will be difficult
or impossible to reduce subsidies or to carry out tiany of the other necessary
reforms.   Moreover,  the gradual reduction of trade policy distortions will
exert pressures for change in the whole structure of domestic production costs
and output prices, and will thus serve to identify other needed structural
adjustments and guide policy reforms accordingly, as the economy moves towards



- 21 -
international competitiveness and relative prices.   Trade reform, to be Buc-
cessful and lasting, must be accompanied by other reforms to enable the economy
to respond to the new opportunities that will emerge in a more open economy.
Hence, trade reform is at the heart of Mexico's structural adjustment needs,
and it is partly for that reason that the first quick-disbursing policy-based
Bank loan to Mexico is proposed in support of trade policy reform.
C.1    The Trade Liberalization Program:  1986-88
43.     Trade policy reform is the first area in which major structural reform
is being undertaken.  The trade policy program that would be supported by the
proposed loan is described in the Government's Statement of Foreign Trade Poli-
cy (Annex IV). The measures constituting this program and their implementation
schedule are discussed separately in Part IV below.
44.    Within the complementary context of the stabilization program described
in the previous section, the trade liberalization program is aimed at achieving
a gradual, orderly, and programmed opening of the Mexican economy through a
rationalization of the trade incentive regime, elimination of distortions and
controls in the foreign exchange markets, and a reduction of effective protec-
tion.  The trade liberalization program involves a change in the instrumenta-
tion of protection--from QRs and ORPs to tariffs--and a programmed reduction
over time in tariffs and their dispersion (Figure 32).  The net effect of this
program will be to permit Mexico to exploit its comparative advantages in manu-
facturing,  agriculture,  and mining,  as described  in Annex VII.   The result
should be to generate rapid growth of non-oil exports and efficient import
substitution, which are labor-intensive and hence employment-generating (see
Part III.D below).   This will occur in conjunction with exports that permit
economies of scale through increasing participation in the international
division of labor.

- 22 -
45.    In the appraisal and negotiation of the proposed loan, it became evident
that the effect on protection of QRs on imports and the use of ORPs for the
purpose of calculating import duties is very similar.  It was agreed that these
two protection devices could be aggregated on a net basis to measure the total
percentage of domestic production protected by NTBs.  As of March 31, 1986, it
was estimated that 55% of domestic production (Table VIII.13) was still covered
by QRs (compared to 100% at the start of 1985), and a further 17.5% by ORPs. A
number of import tariff categories are covered by both QRs and ORPs, such that
the net NTB coverage of domestic production as of March 31, 1986 was about
67.5%.   In loan negotiations,  it was agreed  that only  the net concept was
meaningful for the measurement of changes in protection afforded by NTBs.
46.      The proposed  trade reform program is expected to generate, over the
medium term, new exports to offset increased import demand, so that exports and
imports will rise together as a percentage of GDP as the economy moves towards
the more typical export-CDP ratios observed in other economies (Table 1).  In
the short term, the trade liberalization is not expected to have an unduly
negative impact on the balance of payments, because real economic activity is
likely to be depressed throughout 1986 (Figure 24) and the real exchange rate
is at an all-time record high level (Figure 4).
C.2    Other Structural Reforms
47.    In order to ensure that the economy can fully respond to and exploit new
opportunities for efficient growth and employment in a more open economy,
other structural adjustments will be needed.   The structural reforms outlined
below are those which, in the Bank's judgment, will be necessary over the
medium term. These reforms are broadly consistent with the Government's stated
intentions, and have in fact already begun to be implemented in a number of
areas.   The medium-term scenarios analyzed below assume that the Government
will seek ways to implement these adjustments expeditiously, particularly in
the following areas: public sector resource management; financial sector poli-
cy; industrial restructuring; agriculture; foreign investment and technology
transfer; and petroleum sector strategy.  The objectives of these reforms are
the resumption of growth in GDP and per capita consumption, together with a
gradual improvement in external creditworthiness.
48.    Public Sector Resource Management.  The overexpansion of the public sec-
tor after the early 1970s occurred in part to offset the lagging growth poten-
tial of an inward-oriented economy. As the economy is gradually opened, Mexico
will be able to commensurately scale back burdensome subsidies and inefficiency
in public sector resource mobilization and management. A number of reforms are
being considered and implemented  in this context:   Reform of the tax system;
reform of public sector pricing and subsidy policies; improvements in the
management or divestiture of parastatals; improvement in investment planning;
and reform of public sector procurement policies.
49.    Reliance on taxation of domestic activities (as distinct from oil export
revenue) will need to increase.   The Government is working on modification of
existing legislation and administrative practices, including actions to elimi-
nate bias against equity financing, close loopholes, and reduce tax evasion.



- 23 -
The goal is to reverse the downward trend of non-oil tax revenues in recent
years (Figure 5).  Public sector pricing of tradeable goods will need to place
greater reliance on international prices, or be decontrolled altogether, in
order to increase the efficiency of resource use and reduce implicit subsi-
dies.   The goal would be to continue the downward trend since the early 198Ds
in the level of transfers and subsidies (Figure 6), to decontrol prices, and to
increase the real level of controlled prices.   In addition,  the Government is
now implementing the divestiture of up to 200 state companies.  Public invest-
ment, which fell to below 7% of GDP in 1984-85 for the first time since the
early 1970s (Figure 18) and is expected to fall below 6% of GDP in 1986, would
need to gradually recover and be redirected in coming years into areas such as
basic infrastructure and human resourcesp both of which have been severely af-
fected by the austerity efforts since 1983.  There is a need for improved proj-
ect evaluation and selection, and more integrated public investment programming
over a multiyear horizon with a closer link to assessments of financing avail-
ability. Finally, public sector procurement policies would need to be refornmu-
lated so as to encourage a more competitive and internationally efficient
allocation of such purchases.
50.     Financial Sector Policy.  Mexico's financial system grew rapidly until
the early 1970s, but has suffered a prolonged cyclical decline since then
(Figure 9).  The decline accelerated after 1982, as noted in Part I, when the
Government nationalized the banking system and forcibly converted foreign-cur-
rency deposits.  Credit allocation and interest rate controls have been stead-
ily expanded to cover 75% of commercial bank assets.   Meanwhile, with rising
fiscal deficits over the same period, the public sector share in total credit
(Figure 11) has increased from less than 25% in the early 1970s to nearly 80%
by 1985.
51.    Increasing credit availability to the private sector will become a vital
element in the process of adjustment to a more open economy. Mexico will need
to reverse the severe erosion of its financial system, by gradually deregulat-
ing interest rates and credit allocation schemes.   Declining fiscal deficits
should then absorb declining shares of increased domestic financial savings and
make available sizeable increases in credit to the private sector.
52.     Exchange Rate System.   As noted in Parts I and II, the exchange rate
was devalued sharply in real terms in 1982.  A dual exchange rate was intro-
duced as a transitory measure and has been maintained since then.  Until mid-
1985, the gap between the controlled and the so-called "free" (also controlled)
rates declined steadily from more than 50% to about 7.5% (Figure 33). Together
with the trade liberalization measures of July 25, 1985, the authorities deval-
ued  the controlled  rate by 17% and  allowed  the "free rate" to float.   On
August 7, they abandoned the system of preannouncing the daily rate of depre-
ciation in the controlled market for one month ahead, and adopted instead a
managed float.   Since July,  the controlled rate has depreciated significantly
faster than domestic inflation, but the spread between the controlled and free
rates widened to nearly 50% by late 1985 (Figure 33).  So far in 1986 the con-
trolled rate has depreciated by about 40% in real terms between mid-1985 and
mid-1986 (Figure 4), and the spread has narrowed to less than 5% during the
first five months of 1986. As a result of the new managed float, the drain on
international reserves that occurred during the first five months of 1985 was



- 24 -
halted, and indeed some actual strengthening of Mexico's reserve position oc-
curred in the early months of 1986, which, however, has recently deteriorated
again.
Figure 33
EXCHANGE RATE DIFFERENTIALS

a  ~  
53.    While the controlled exchange market covers about 80Z of trade and pay-
ments transactions, the existence of a premium on the parallel market rate is
an inducement to under- and overinvoicing, and is a discentive to non-oil
exports. The presence of exchange market controls has encouraged the develop-
ment of the parallel market, giving rise to distortions, capital flight, and
the risk of unfavorable effects on confidence.   The Government has recently
reiterated its commitment to exercise flexibility in the management of exchange
rate policy and to seek to minimize exchange rate differentials by adjusting
the controllcd rate as needed.   An early unification of rates would have a
positive impact on confidence and would further improve the environment for
exporters.
54.     Industrial Restructuring.  A large share of heavy industrial and basic
goods production is accounted for by parastatals such as PEMEX, FERTIMEX, and
SIDERMEX, some of which are internationally uncompetitive and would need to be
restructured in consonance with the trade liberalization program.  A plan for
the restructuring of Hexico's railroads, both physically and financially, was
adopted in 1985 (with the support of a Bank loan), and actions planned for 1986
include restructuring of parastatals in the areas of steel, fertilizers, ship-
building, and sugar.
55.   Policy measures which expose the Mexican economy to greater international
competition will place substantial competitive pressure on activities with a
relatively high domestic resource cost (DRC) ratio, such as rubber products,
plastics, basic and secondary iron and steel products, consumer electronics,
and automobiles, and will exert some competitive pressure on the activities
with uncertain international competitiveness, such as clothing, wood products,
basic  chemicals,  nonferrous metals,  and non-metallic minerals.   Successful



- 25 -
adjustment to a liberalization effort will therefore require productivity gains
(and hence reductions in unit costs of production) of sufficient magnitude to
achieve acceptable levels of international competitiveness.   Industries with
uncertain international competitiveness and those classified as uncompetitive
are concentrated in intermediate and capital and durable goods.  In general,
and as expected, high levels of effective protection are associated with
uncompetitive activities, for example, automobiles, electronic and electrical
apparatus, basic iron and steel, and structural steel products.   The low and
negative protection to most consumer goods industries is similarly reflected in
adequate levels of efficiency in such activities as food products, beverages,
and soaps and detergents.
56.     By international standards, Mexico's productivity performance was poor
during the 1970s.  The mean rate of total factor productivity CTFP) change is
similar to that encountered in other heavily protected economies, such as
Portugal, the Philippines, and India, and is well below the rates of such
trading competitors as the United States, Japan, Korea, Thailand, and Turkey.
Mexico has relatively high variability in the distribution of TFP growth rates
as well; the coefficient of variation of 3.2 is high for the level of per
capita income of the economy.
57.     Industrial sector adjustment to trade policy reform will require that
firms in adversely affected sectors improve their cost competitiveness via
accelerated productivity performance, if they are to adapt to the new price
regime.   Information on DRC levels, when combined with that on productivity
change, provides some insight into the magnitude of the structural adjustment
problem for Mexican industry.   Industries with acceptable levels of interna-
tional competitiveness, as measured by the DRC, will need to maintain satisfac-
tory levels of productivity change by international standards in order to
preserve or increase their market share.   Industrial sectors which are not
competitive  by  international  standards  will  require  rates  of productivity
change which exceed those of international competitors, if they are to adjust
successfully to the change in relative prices.
58.    The character of the structural adjustment problem can be seen from the
analysis contained in Annex VII. The only activities in which Mexico is both
internationally competitive and shows acceptable productivity performance are
the traditional light industries with  limited protection.   Auto bodies and
parts is the only industry with uncertain but improving international
competitiveness, which is consistent with its export performance; while rubber
products and structural steel are not presently competitive, but are improving
relative to potential external competitors.
59.    A wide range of currently competitive activities are apparently losing
ground to potential international competitors, including such important inter-
mediate goods producers as fertilizers. glass products, cement, chemicals, and
wood products.  Rising levels of inefficiency in these activities will affect
downstream users reducing levels of international competitiveness further.
Capital goods and consumer durables are heavily concentrated in grolps classi-
fied as of uncertain or unacceptable levels of international competitiveness.
60.    If the private sector is to respond to the emerging structure of incen-
tives of a more open economy, it is important tnat the Government continue



- 26 -
making every effort to improve the private sector investment climate.  This
requires stability and clarity of policy rules, adequate credit availability,
and a phaslng down of unnecessary interventions in pricing and internal and
external trade.
61.     Agricultural Sector Polic.  Agriculture hos been especially penalized
by declining or increasingly negative effective protection over the past quar-
ter century (see Part IV). As the domestic terms of trade were turned in favor
of industry, against agriculture and other primary sectors (including mining,
fishery, and forestry), Mexican agricultural growth rates declined ateadily
from 4.8% per year in the period 1930-60 to 3.4% in the 1960s, and 2% during
the 1970s. From being a net exporting sector, agriculture turned into a large
net importer, increasingly dependent on credit and input subsidies to offset
the anti-export bias and the negative effective protection emanating from the
trade regime.
62.      As the trade regime is liberalized,  and industrial protection dimin-
ished, agriculture is a major potential beneficiary.   But in order to enable
the sector to respond to these improvements in the incentive regime, Mexico
would need to gradually liberalize trade in agricultural goods and deregulate
the pervasive Government controls on the pricing, subsidization, and marketing
of agricultural  inputs and production.   Since these reforms are inseparably
linked, the Bank has offered to support the Government's trade liberalization
program in agriculture under a separate agricultural sector loan.   In parti-
cular, the role and activities of CONASUPO, the food marketing agency, is being
reexamined and scaled back.   Also, with renewed opportunities for productive
and profitable activities in agriculture, Mexico will benefit from the
announced completion of land reform by 1988.
63.     Foreign Iuve.tuent and Technology Transfer.  As Mexico moves toward a
more open trade regime, it will enhance the benefits of that openness, includ-
ing its external competitiveness, by also becoming more open to foreign invest-
ment and technology transfer.   This will be particularly the case if Mexico
wants to replace foreign credit with foreign equity participation.  Mexico is
seeking a substantial increase in net new foreign investment, over the average
of US$400 million during the period 1983-85, but this is likely to occur only
with significant modernization of the foreign investment laws. Export-oriented
foreign investment offers the best prospects over the medium term, attracted by
lower labor costs, which are now lower in Mexico than in the Far East, and a
liberalized trading environment.   The most effective adjustment might be to
publish clear and simple rules for certain broad classes of export-oriented
investment and technology transfers, such as are already embedded in the
"maquila" (in-bond) legislation, which has in recent years been considerably
extended and liberalized outside the border areas (see para. 9).  Recent deci-
sions to approve joint ventures and full-ownership foreign investments in
selected areas indicate the Government's shift to a more flexible policy.
64.     Petrolem Sector Strategy.  The emerging situation in the world petro-
leum markets will adversely affect Mexico in the short run, but also creates an
opportunity to fundamentally reassess its petroleum production and export



- 27 -
strategy in the light of similarly fundamental changes taking place in the
strategies of other major world producers.  Even at lower oil prices interna-
tionally, Mexico ia likely to continue deriving a large economic surplus and
other benefits from its oil resources.  Towards that end, Mexico would have to
maintain flexible export volume and pricing policies and maximize the contribu-
tion of oil revenues to the balance of payments and public finances.
65.       A  reassessment of medium-term  hydrocarbons  policy  should  reflect
Mexico's position as the holder of the fifth largest proven oil and gas re-
serves in the world (Annex VIII, Table 26), as well as Mexico's position among
low-cost  producers worldwide  (Annex VIII,  Table 34).   A medium-term  price
scenario of US$15 per barrel should lead to an increase in the rate of growth
of world demand and a decline in supplies from high-cost producing areas, whieh
may represent as much as 502 of total production from non-OPEC, non-Communist
areas.   In such an environment, Mexico could expect to increase its share of
rising world demand over the projection period. At present, Mexico holds 7.2%
of proven world oil and gas reserves, but, despite its cost advantages, ac-
counts for only 5.7% of total world production.  Thus, in terms of its produc-
tion-to-reserves ratio, Mexico is well below internationaL standards, though
its relative cost advantage suggests that this ratio could be higher.
66.    So far in 1986, total export volume has declined to an expected average
of 1.35 million barrels per day (mbd) in the first six months of 1986, thus
aggravating  the revenue loss from declining oil prices.   This has occurred
because Mexico has used lagged pricing formulae that tended to price Mexican
oil out of the markets in declining price situations. By February 1986, Mexico
made a strong bid to recover target export volumes through a major price reduc-
tion and its decision to introduce daily price fixing--linked to spot markets--
beginning in March. In April, Mexico adopted a netback formula to become fully
competitive, and export volume has increased from 1.1 mbds in early 1986 to
1.45 mbds expected for June.
67.     Because of the extreme stringency of resources experienced by Mexico at
the present time, the actual level of investments by PEMEX, Mexico's State oil
company, has fallen sharply since the late 1970s and early 1980s. Before this
fall in investment, it had been estimated that Mexico needed an annual rate of
investment of US$2-3 billion to maintain a production level of 3 mbds.  There
is, in fact, some concern that the current investment level is only barely suf-
ficient to maintain existing capacity. Since at US$15 per barrel or even some-
what lower prices the economic rate of return on oil investments in Mexico
remains very high--probably higher than in most sectors of the economy--it is
important for Mexico to explore ways in which the level of petroleum sector
investments can be increased.   It may, therefore, be worthwhile for Mexico to
consider risk-sharing arrangements in the exploration and drilling for new oil.
D.     SOCIAL IMPACT OF TRADE POLICY AND TRADE LIBERALIZATIOE
68.       Social development,  income distribution,  and  employment have  been
adversely affected by Mexico's import-subtituting industrialization strategy.
Agriculture, which was once a flourishing, labor-intensive, and net-exporting
sector, became a heavy net importer and slowed its absorption of labor. Growth



- 28 -
of income and employment in rural areas declined with the rise in the anti-
export bias of the trade regime and the associated resource pull toward indus-
try and capital intensive production for domestic markets.  These factors--and
the bureaucratization in Mexico City of discretionary trade and other incen-
tives--promoted urban and regional concentration on a scale almost unequalled
anywhere else.
69.     Detailed calculations of labor intensity in different sectors of the
Mexican economy have found that employment generation in exporting sectors on
the average exceeds that of the econonr  as a whole by 351-40% (Annex VIII,
Table 30). As noted in Part I, the inward-biased trade regime contributed to
rising unemployment--formal or unrecorded, very low wages for non-union non-
governmental workers,  and outmigration.    Statistical estimates suggest that
expatriate Mexican workers, as a percent of the total Mexican work force, rose
from 5.1% in 1940 to 22.6% by 1975 (Annex VIII, Table 33), and is likely to
have risen still further since then.
70.    The high levels of quantitative and other barriers to foreign competi-
tion over the period 1982-85, combined with a 30% decline in real wages, per-
mitted most firms to remain profitable and indeed to reduce their debt burdens
significantly (in real terms).  Despite the stressful economic environment of
this period, there has been little or no industrial bankruptcy. Similarly, the
large real wage decline cushioned the unemployment that would otherwise have
resulted from the 1982-84 recession.
71.    An orderly redirection of Mexico's incentive regime towards a more open-
economy growth path is expected to increase the labor intensity of new invest-
ments--given Mexico's internationally low-cost labor resources--and hence the
rate of growth of wages and employment in relation to overall economic growth.
Similarly, the bias of a trade regime that favored inefficient low-quality pro-
ducers over consumers will be lessened.  But in the short run, there will be
some firms that may be forced into bankruptcy, and, consequently, there will be
subsectors or industries that cannot expect to become internationally competi-
tive. Other firms with a potential for exports and efficient import substitu-
tion will be able to grow and increase their employment, even despite an
overall stagnation of the economy in the short run.  It is interesting to note
that the in-bond ("maquila") sector has grown rapidly in both production and
employment over the past several years (as noted in para. 9).   Finally,  the
heavy manpower resources that have been absorbed by administration of the QR
system can be released Eor productive activities that will emerge as the
economy opens up.
E.     THE ETERRAL nIAUCIUG PfOGRA  POR 1986-88
72.    Just as the macro policy framework must be supportive of trade liberali-
zation, so the external financing needs of Mexico must be met if these reforms
are to be successful. The Bank alone cannot provide more than a modest pro-
portion of Mexico's projected external financing needs for 1986-88. Therefore,
the Bank has emphasized to the Government that the proposed TPL cannot by it-
self be viewed as sufficient to ensure the viability of the trade liberaliza-
tion program. Rather, it should be viewed as a catalyst for other forms of
lending that may be mobilized in parallel with the TPL.



- 29 -
73.     The lack of net new external financing so far in 1986 has exacerbated
Mexico's macroeconomic difficulties.   It is therefore a key objective of the
proposed TPL to provide a stimulus to other external lenders, particularly the
commercial banks, to join in a concerted international effort to mobilize suit-
able external financing for Mexico over the period 1986-88 in support of an
appropriate program of stabilization and growth-oriented adjustment. Presenta-
tion of this loan to the Board is being made before the full external financing
package has been assembled for Mexico, so as to facilitate the catalytic role
of the proposed loan through its recognition of, and support for, Mexico's
trade liberalization program.   However,  the loan as proposed will not become
effective until the Bank receives satisfactory assurances that Mexico's
external financing needs are likely to be met.
F.     TEE ROLE OF TEE BANK
74.     In the past, the Bank has supported Mexico's development efforts with
investment and credit projects in a wide range of sectors, including agricul-
ture, rural development, infrastructure, housing, industrial finance, etc.
Following the crisis of 1982, the Bank shifted the primary focus of its activi-
ty from projects to a greater concentration on the policy dialogue and lending
to support structural change.  The Bank has carried out an intensified policy
dialogue with the Government in the wake of the 1982 crisis in the context of
its economic and sector work, and has sponsored or undertaken studies in a
number of areas, including industrial and trade policy, export promotion,
agriculture policy, interest rate and credit subsidy policy, and public sector
investment. The policy dialogue in the area of export development policy has
been supported by the first Export Development Project of 1983. As part of the
Bank's preparation of the present loan proposal, and other possible loans that
would support Mexican policy reforms, discussions have been carried on for some
time concerning major policy reforms in the areas of public sector investment,
parastatal management, and housing.  The policy dialogue on interest rate and
credit subsidies resulted in the General Interest Rate Agreement (GIRA), and
continues as ;.art of the implementation of that Agreement.
75.     As noted in Section C, the first area in which the Government proposes
to undertake adjustments under its 1986-88 structural reform program, to be
implemented in parallel with a continuation of the stabilization program, is to
make the economy more competitive through the reduction of trade barriers, the
maintenance of an attractive real exchange rate, and further expansion of the
free-trade environment for exporters.   The Government's  trade liberalization
program, together with an appropriate exchange rate and macro policy framework,
is to be supported by the proposed loan.  In addition, other areas of policy
adjustment are under consideration.   The further expansion of the free-trade
environment for exporters is to be supported by a Second Export Development
Project loan, which is in an advanced stage of preparation.  The Government's
program also includes rationalization and restructuring of public sector enter-
prises and public sector investment, to be supported by a Technical Assistance
loan whirh is currently under preparation; reduction of financial subsidies, as
provided under GIRA; and agricultural sector adjustments to facilitate the
shift to a more open economy.   The Bank is engaged in a policy dialogue with
the authorities on the possibility of financial and technical support from the
Bank for an agricultural adjustment program that will enable the sector to
become an active beneficiary of the shift to a more open economy.

76.    Bank policy-based lending operations, such as the proposed Trade Policy
Loan, would provide vital financial support during this difficult period for
Mexico.  The Bank would assume a considerable share of total financing during
the 1986-88 period, to support the structural changes necessary for Mexico to
move onto a path of high and sustainable growth and employment and to restore
Mexico's longer-temn financial stability and creditworthiness. The Bank's pro-
gram would provide a vehicle for attracting additional financing from other
official and private commercial sources that are interested in becoming asso-
ciated with Bsnk-supported reforms.
C.     THE ROLE OF THE [IW
77.    The IMF has supported two major stabilization programs in Mexico since
1976.  An Extended Fund Facility was negotiated in 1976, but no further draw-
ings under the program took place after early 1977.   In 1978, the Government
repurchased its early drawings. A second EFF was negotiated in late 1982 for a
total of SDRs 3.6 billion, covering the three-year period through December
1985.  Because of noncompliance with some of the quantitative performance cri-
teria for end-June and end-September 1985, Mexico did not undertake the draw-
ings scheduled for August and November.  A total of SDRs 908 million remained
undrawn under that facility.  In early 1986, the IMF approved a special emer-
gency assistance drawing in support oE Mexico's earthquake reconstruction
needs, in the amount of SDRs 291 million.  It was understood in connection with
that drawing that Mexico would come to an agreement with the IKF on a new
program for 1986.
78.    There have been detailed dipcussions with Fund staff on the program of
measures and the objectives of the proposed loan.
B.     CREDrT ORTRINESS
79.    At the end of 1985, the Bank's share in Mexico's public debt was 5.1%.
The Bank's share in Mexico's total public external interest payments was 4.3%.
The Bank's exposure in Mexico as of end-1985 amounted to 7.6% of its total. Ir.
view of the expectation that sound economic policies will be pursued in the
future, Mexico is considered creditworthy for this loan.
PART IV:   THE PROPOSED LOAM
A.     LOAN HISTORY
80.    The Bank and the Government have engaged, since late 1984, in an active
dialogue on ways to implement the Government's objective announced in the 1982
National Development Plan of gradually opening the Mexican economy.   In 1983,
the Bank approved the first Export Development loan, in support of a liberal-
ized import regime for exporters. Beginning in mid-1984, the Bank indicated to
the Government that it would be willing to consider support for an action pro-
gram of general import and trade policy reform through additional lending in
the form of one or more fast-disbursing loans.  The Trade Policy Loan program
has been discussed with the Government as a multiyear framework for Bank finan-
cial and technical support, and as a basis on which to mobilize additional
financing from commercial sources.



- 31 -
81.     Following the reforms of July 25, 1985, the Bank began appraisal of the
first Trade Policy Loan in Septombor, and completod appraisal on November 25,
1985, after an interruption due to the September 19 earthquako.  Negotiations
wore held in Moxico, D.F. and in Washington, D.C. from March 30 to June 18,
1986.  Tho Mexican delegation Included Mosorm. Francisco Suarez Davila, Under
Secretery of Finance and Public Credit, SHCP; Luis Bruvo Aguilera, Under
Secretary of Foreign Trado, SECOFI; JosO Angel Gurria Trevino, Director Goneral
of Public Crodit, SHCP; Alfredo Philip. Olmedo, Director Goneral, Banco
Nactonal de Comercio Exturlor, B.N.C. (BANCOMEXT); Jose Luis Flores Hernandez,
Director, International Financing Organizations, SHCP; and Ricardo Penaloza
Wobb, Financlal Advisor, BANCOMEXT.   Supplementary loan data are provided  in
Annex III.
B.     LOAN OBJECTIVES AND THil TRADE LIBERALIZATION PROGRAM
82.    The proposed US$500 million Trade Policy Loan (TPL) is intended to sup-
port implementation of Mexico's program to liberalise its trade regime and open
the economy to achieve greater domestic efficiency and international competi-
tiveness, as the means to generate growth and employment through non-oil export
diversification  and reduced dependence on subsidies.   The proposed  loan  is
conceived as the first in a series of possible repeater operations over the
three-year period (1986-8B) covered by the trade policy reform program of the
Government. Given the far-reaching changes that will occur virtually through-
out the economy and the need to implement reforms in an orderly and gradual
fashion to allow time for the needed adjustments at the firm and sectoral lev-
els, it is clear that trade liberalization will need to be phased over a period
of several years and may require continued Bank assistance beyond 1988.   The
program is based on the recognition that this objective can best be achieved by
a gradual, preannounced, and programmed reduction of tariffs and the elimina-
tion as far as possible of remaining discretionary barriers to trade, such as
QRs and ORPs.  Both are referred to as non-tariff barriers (NTBs).  The pro-
posed loan may also assist the Government in mobilizing complementary funding
from commercial sources.
83.     The Bank estimates that, on the basis of the Government's prevent plans
(Part III.C) for the phasing down of NTBs, it is likely that the production-
weighted coverage of NTBs will decline from 1002 at end-1984--and 67.51 as of
March 31, 1986--to between 30 and 402 by end-October 1988.  The present struc-
ture of NTB coverage, as reflected in Table 3, will likely show a virtual elim-
ination of NTBs for the manufacturing sector, a partial elimination for agri-
culture, and little or no elimination for the oil sector.  Assuming that NTBs
will continue to be in effect (by October 1988) for basic grains and some other
subsectors in agricultural sector programs; for automobiles, pharmaceuticals,
and computers (these are not scheduled to expire until after 1988); for oil and
derivatives; and for products hazardous to public health and safety, it can be
estimated that about a third of production would then remain under NTBs.  How-
ever,  it should be noted that:  oil and derivatives alone account for 21% of
production (Table 3), where NTBs have little or no protective effect since
Mexico is an oil exporter; the sector programs in manufacturing that would
remain under NTBs account for less than 3%; and most of agriculture (apart from
basic grains) is internationally competitive. Hence, the expected fTB coverage
by end-1988 will have only limited protection effects, and would not materially
affect the credibility or effectiveness of the announced tariff calendar.

84.     The Government is cognizant of the need to have a preannounced QR/NTB
reduction calendar.  Such a calendar was indeed announced in October 1984, for
a period  extending through to 1989.1/   This calendar was superseded by the
drastic QR reduction on July 25, 1985.  Following the measures of July 25, the
Government announced its intention to prepare a new revised calendar for
publication; but this plan was soon overtaken by Mexico's decision to seek
accession to GATT. Once the GATT negotiations were begun in November 1985, the
Government felt it would be unwise to publicly commit further QR reductions,
lest Mexico's negotiating position be undermined in advance.   The Government
informed  the Bank  that  no QR  or NTB  calendars could  be committed  before
completion  of  the  GATT  negotiations,  now  expected  by  July  1986.    The
Government'c  broad  intentions  in  this  regard  (see para.  95  (iii-iv))  are
included in Annex IV, Mexico's Statement of Foreign Trade Policy.
85.     The Trade Policy Reform Program.  The main objectives of trade policy
reform over the period 1986-88 may be summarized as follows:
(i)    Tariffs.  Reduction of the overall structure of tariffs, from a
maximum of 100X at present, to 30% by end-1988; reduction in the
dispersion of tariffs, from a maximum range of nominal rates of
31     For details on the October 1984 calendar, see the Statement of Foreign
Trade Policy, Annex IV.



- 33 -
0% to 100% at the start of 1986 to a maximum nominal dispersion
of 30  percentage  points.    These  targets  are  summarized  in
Table 4. A nominal tariff dispersion of 30 percentage points and
the full elimination of NTBs imply a dispersion of effective
rates of protection from highs of up to 50%-75% to lows of -10%
to -15%, compared to 1984 levels that varied between negative
rates for agriculture and minerals to up to 3500% in some manu-
factured goods, according to Government estimates.   In addition
to the basic tariff structure, as scheduled for reduction over
time (Figure 32), the Government will make selective use if
necessary of temporary surtaxes of up to 50% of the basic tariff
rates;
(ii)   Number of Tariff lates.  A reduction in the number of rates will
be undertaken, from the level of 10 at end-1985 to an end-1988
target of 5 rates. This will have the effect of further reducing
the scope for discretionary and dispersion of effective protec-
tion, thus making the tariff system more transparent and facili-
tating the adjustment by producers;
(iii)  gRs.  Phasing out of remaining QRs, with the exception of oil
and oil derivatives, agricultural goods,4/ items under existing
sector programs for automobiles and pharmaceuticals, but includ-
ing those applicable to the industrial sector programs not yet in
effect.51   Most future sectoral programs will rely on tariffs
rather than QRs;6/
(iv)   Official Imaort Reference Prices (0RPa).  Complete elimination by
end-1987, to be replaced with temporary country-specific, commod-
ity-specific surtaxes, subject to appropriate appeals and in-
vestigation procedures in accordance with GATT provisions on
anti-dumping, customs valuation, and injury tests;7/
(v)    Establishment of a NeM  Anti miug Sy te.  The new Foreign Trade
Law of 1985 provides broad legislative authority for the estab-
lishment of a modern antidumping system, based on specific sur-
tariffs in place of ORPs. The Government intends during 1986 to
4/     Agricultural   trade  deregulation   is  under  consideration  by   the
Government, and could be supported with a separate agricultural sector
loan. See also paras. 64-65 in this report.
51     One of the industrial sector programs already in effect (capital goods)
would be restructured to phase out the use of QRs, to be replaced with
tariffs, and/or special temporary surtaxes.
61     Of the eight sectoral programs currently under preparation, only one is
presently planned to make use of QIs (computers). All others will rely
solely on tariffs, and/or possibly special temporary surtaxes.
7/     The 1985  Foreign  Trade Law  provides  broad  legislative authority  to
implement modern antidumping procedures (see para. 33).  The Bank will
provide technical and financial assistance to the Government in its
implementation of a modern antidumping system.



- 34 -
issue the implementing regulations and administrative procedures
required for the establiahment of such a system.   However,  the
Government expects that it will take through the end of 1987 to
make the system fully operational, and for that reason intends to
continue the use of ORPs on an interim basis until the end of
1987; and
(vi)   Maintenance  of  an  Adequate  Exchange  Rate with  a  view  to:
(i) unifying the dual exchange rate at the earliest possible
timp;  (ii)  phasing  out  exchange  controls;  (iii)  achieving
adequate reserve levels; and (iv) ensuring rapid growth of
non-oil exports.

86.      The Government's trade policy reform program will be published  in
Mexico, including  interim adjustments to the end-1988 targets.   The Govern-
ment's Statement of Foreign Trade Policy (Annex IV) will be published in Mexico
prior to Board presentation, including the tariff reduction calendar through
the end of October 1988.   As part of the policy program described  in that
Statement, the Government has recently undertaken the following actions:
(i)    Reduction of the maximum tariff from 100% to 45%;
(ii)    Reduction of the average tariff to 24.1%;
(iii)    Reduction of the number of tariffs to a maximum of 8; and
(iv)    Reduction of NTBs to a maximum of 67.5% of production.
C.     THE BORROWER
87.     The National Bank for Foreign Trade (BANCOMEXT) will be the Borrower,
and will be responsible, with the support of the Secretariat of Finance (SHCP),
the Secretariat of Trade and Industrial Promotion (SECOFI), and the Central
Bank (Banco de Mexico),  for administering the proposed loan.   BANCOMEXT has
recently been granted a new charter that greatly expands its policy, financing,



- 35 -
and technical roles in all aspects of Mexico's foreign trade.   Hence,  it can
effectively act as both borrower for the proposed loan, and focal point for the
monitoring of, and technical support for, the trade reform process.
D.     DISBURSEMENT
88.      The proposed  loan would be disbursed  in two  tranches:    thle  first
tranche, of US$300 million would become available upon effectiveness, and the
second tranche, of US$189 million, would become available upon fulfillment of
conditions for second tranche release, but not later than December 31, 1986.
If the latter conditions are not met by that date, the second tranche will be
cancelled, unless otherwise agreed between the Bankc and Mexico. The balance of
US$11 miLlion, for the financing of collateral studies and the establishment of
a modern antidumping system by Mexico, would be disbursed more slowly, but
before November 30, 1988, which is the closing date for the proposed loan.
89.       Conditions  of  effectiveness (first  tranche  disbursement)  are  that:
(i) the Bank shall have been furnished with evidence, satisfactory to the Bank,
that the Government's macropolicy framework is consistent with the trade liber-
alization objectives of the Trade Policy Program (hereafter referred to as the
Program) being supported by this Loan; and (ii) the Bank shall have received
satisfactory assurances that the Government's external financing needs for 1986
will be me..  In addition, the Bank will, prior to the date of effectiveness,
monitor progress in the execution of the Program, in particular with regard to
the maintenance of the policies outlined in para. 96.
90.    Conditions for second-tranche release.  Release of the second tranche of
US$189 million of the Loan would be contingent upon:
(i)    Satisfactory progress with respect to continued implementation of
the Program;
(ii)    Macroeconomic policy framework of the Government  is consistent
with the Program;
(iii)    Reduction, no later than December 31, 1986, of the coverage of
Non-Tariff Barriers by not less than 5% of total production of
goods in Mexico, vis-a-vis the coverage existing on March 31,
1986; and
(iv)   Publication of internationally acceptable regulations for estab-
lishment of an administrative antidumping system.
E.     PROCUREMENf AND ADMINISTRATION
91.     Proceeds of the loan would be used to reimburse 100% of the foreign
exchange cost of eligible imports and collateral studies. Eligible imports for
purposes of this loan shall be defined broadly as those imports procured after
January 1, 1986 that fall into categories ("fracciones") that were freed from
QRs on or after July 25, 1985.   Ineligible imports include goods subject to
ORPs or QRs of any kind; imports financed from other official multilateral or
bilateral sources; and goods intended for military or paramilitary use. A list
of ineligible imports is included in the Annex to Schedule I of the Loan
Agreement.



- 36 -
92.     BANCOMEXT will be responsible for maintaining loan accounts and for the
preparation and submission of withdrawal applications.  Disbursements from the
proposed loan would be made on the basis oE a summary from the Banco de Mexico
detailing individual transactions in each relevant period in respect of eligi-
ble imports, together with a certification from the Banco de Mexico of payment
of the amounts involved and of their eligibility under the loan. Applications
for withdrawals will be consolidated and submitted in amounts not less than
US$1 million.
93.    Both private and public sector imports would be eligible for financing.
Contracts under US$5 million each would be awarded on the basis of the normal
procurement practices of the purchaser.  Contracts for other goods and servi-
ces, estimated to cost US$5 million or more each, will be procured through
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines.
F.     MONITORING, REPORTING, AND AUDITING
94.     The proposed Trade Policy Loan (TP) and Mexico's trade liberalization
program will require monitoring of trade policy targets stipulated in the
Government's action calendar attached to the Statement of Foreign Trade Policy
(Annex IV), as well as regular assessments of the adequacy of the macro policy
framework.   Possible proposals for follow-up TPLs will,  in part, be based on
progress towards the Government's objectives.
95.    The Borrower (BANCOMEXT) will prepare a quarterly report on progress and
trends in foreign trade and trade policy, including a quarterly assessment of
eEfective protection levels. The Bank will monitor the progress of implementa-
tion of the program through regular supervision and exchange of views with the
Borrower and the Government, covering both policy instrument targets and per-
formance targets as described above and in particular, but not limited to: the
phasing out of QRs and ORPs; the reduction of tariff dispersion; the reduction
of effective protection; the growth of non-oil exports; and the maintenance of
an adequate real effective exchange rate.  The Bank would rely on the IMP for
the monitoring of key macroeconomic policies and indicators.
G.     COLLATERAL STUDIES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
96.    A key element of the Bank's proposed contribution to the success of the
trade liberalization program consists of a program of collateral studies and
technical assistance to provide timely and in-depth analysis of and support for
the implementation of the three-year trade reform program.   The proposed TPL
includes for this purpose a technical assistance component in the amount of
US$11 million, divided in two parts. The amount of US$3 million will be avail-
able to finance a series of studies, which may include major studies on primary
areas of policy reform needed to complement trade liberalization, e.g., indus-
trial restructuring and sectoral programming in support of improved interna-
tional  competitiveness;  agricultural  sector  adjustment;  financial  sector
adjustment; and procurement and other trade-related policies of the public
sector.   The second part,  in the amount of US$8 million, will be available to
finance support for the establishment of a modern antidumping system and a
system of full quarterly computerized updating of effective protection
calculations.



- 37 -
B.     PROJECT BENEFITS
97.    The main justification for the proposed Bank loan is that it will pro-
vide direct financial and technical support to the Government in a particularly
critical phase of the medium-term program of trade poLicy reform and economic
restructuring.   The expected benefit of the program is to induce a long-term
reorientation of the Mexican economy, away from inefficient import substitution
behind high protective barriers, towards greater international competitiveness
in both non-oil exports and the production for domestic markets, as discussed
in Annex VI.  The phasing out of quantitative import restrictions and ORPs is
also expected to reduce inflationary pressures in the economy, improve the ef-
fectiveness of overall demand-management policies of the Government, and reduce
the vulnerability of the economy to wide swings in response to small deviations
in policy, as discussed in Part III.
98.     The second major justification for the proposed TPL program is that it
will provide a basis on which the Government can mobilize needed additional
financing from commercial sources.  At the time of the negotiations in 1983-84
that led to the restructuring of Mexico's external debt (as noted in Part [It),
the shared expectation of the Government and the international financial commu-
nity was that Mexico would successfully complete its stabilization program with
the support of the Extended Fund Facility of the IMF, and thus recover suffi-
cient external confidence and creditworthiness to return to voluntary lending
by 1986.   These expectations have not been borne out, and the new financing
needed for 1986 will be difficult for Mexico to obtain under the best of cir-
cumstances.  Commercial lenders have since late 1985 indicated to the Govern-
ment and the Bank that major new lending in 1986 would not be possible without
a new IMF program and structural reforms supported by the Bank, particularly in
the area of trade liberalization. The Bank has indicated to commercial lenders
that parallel arrangements would be possible on the basis of the proposed Trade
Policy Loan and the closely related EDP-II loan, which is expected to be ready
for presentation to the Executive Directors in a few months.
99.    It will be key to the success of the trade liberalization that external
financing be assured on a realistic and timely basis.  Net new financing needs
for 1986 were estimated by the Bank (at the time of appraisal) at US$3.0 bil-
lion at an assumed oil price of US$20 per barrel (as discussed in Part III).
Under an assumed oil price of US$12 per barrel, the total net new financing
need is currently estimated by the Government to be US$5.3 billion, r-f which
some US$2.5 billion is expected from commercial bank sources (see Annex IV).
100.   The proposed TPL would support the original objective of the Government
of undertaking the structural reforms needed to achieve sustainable growth and
employment and to recover external creditworthiness and confidence sufficient
to return to normal commercial lending over the medium term.  It is thus not
the purpose of the proposed loan to displace the financial markets, but rather
to facilitate Mexico's return to commercial lending.  Therefore, the parallel
cofinancing arrangements that are envisioned would entail the comfort of direct
Bank support to Mexico and Bank monitoring of the proposed trade liberalization
program.



- 38 -
I.     PROJECT RISKS
101.    The principal risk of the trade reform program is the possibility that
the macropolicy framework may become inconsistent with a gradual opening of the
economy.  Trade liberalization attempts have failed in the past in Mexico, as
elsewhere, not because of tariff and QR reduction, but because of overly expan-
sive macro policy or an overvalued exchange rate.
102.    Other risks of the trade reform program relate to the uncertainties in
the external environment, particularly if these are not offset on a timely and
appropriate  fashion by the macro-policy  framework.    External  risks  include
weakened export prospects and the possibility of further weakening of interna-
tional oil prices.  An important additional risk is failure to generate strong
expectations and adjustment with respect to the target tariff structure.  The
latter could occur for a variety of reasons, most prominently, a delay in
substantially reducing the level of NTB coverage from the present level of
67.5% of production.
103.   In addition, the proposed operation faces a risk that Mexico may be una-
ble to mobilize adequate and timely external financing.  The medium-term pros-
pects outlined in this report are based on an assumed average international
price of oil of US$13 per barrel and the expectation of substantial non-oil
export growth, achieved through active exchange rate policy, and fiscal and
monetary discipline, in addition to the trade liberalization.  Adverse external
circumstances, such as protectionism, a collapse in oil prices, or erosion of
domestic fiscal and monetary discipline, could affect the political commitment
to trade liberalization and make more difficult the attainment of adequate
rigor and credibility in the implementation of the trade reform program over a
sufficiently long period.   In the event of a marked deterioration in export
performance, due for e-aample to a collapse in oil prices, additional adjustment
efforts by Mexico (including an acceleration of the trade policy reform pro-
gram) will be required, and additional external financing needs may develop.
104.   There are, however, a number of significant elements in the Government's
program, and in the design of this loan, which reduce the above risks.  First,
the Government has demonstrated a strong commitment to trade policy reform by
the major steps taken during 1985 (Part IV), particularly the Government's
politically difficult decisions to drastically reduce QRs and to join GATT.
The Government has weighed the risks of a more open-economy development strate-
gy, and has come to the conclusion, as expressed in the Statement of Develop-
ment Policy, that Mexico has no viable alternative other than such an opening
for moving the economy onto a sustainable pattern of growth and high employ-
ment.
105.    Second,  the Government has taken drastic policy measures during late
1985 and early 1986 to recover the momentum of the successful stabilization
program of 1983-84.  A revised fiscal budget and policy program for 1986 are
currently being  formulated  (see Part  III.B).   These,  together with the TPL
program, represent key elements of a coherent strategy for recovering sound
macro policy and restructuring the economy.



- 39 -
106.    Measures are being, and will continue to be, implemented to facilitate
adjustment to a more open economy environment.   For example,  the new exchange
rate policy, consisting of a managed float, is designed to reflect inflation
trends and maintain adequate reserves, thus facilitating the use of exchange
rate adjustments in place of quantitative import controls to regulate the
balance of payments.
107.   Third, the trade policy program to be supported by the proposed TPL will
itself lend credibility and strength to the structural reform process, as dis-
cussed in Part III.  By announcing explicit, objective, and quantifiable tar-
gets for trade policy and a calendar of adjustments over three years to the
stipulated end-targets, the Covernment can achieve a sustained movement toward
the end-targets that is both gradual and credible.   Each calendar adjustment,
by itself, entails manageable political and economic costs. With the implemen-
tation of each successive calendar adjustment, the Government will be able to
build credibility for the end-targets, and thereby induce an orderly adjustment
by  firms  to the announced  target  incentive  regime.   The  transparency  of a
tariff-based trade policy, replacing the longstanding QR system, is critical to
this strategy.   Indeed,  the policy reforms of 1985, particularly the unprece-
dented reduction of QRs on July 25, have already created a widely shared recog-
nition that the Government is serious in its commitment to trade liberaliza-
tion.   Moreover,  the significant  financial support  that would  flow from the
Trade Policy Loan program would itself increase the domestic credibility of the
Covernment's trade liberalization program, in part by strengthening the balance
of payments and, thus, the perceived viability of trade liberalization.
PART V - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MEXICO
A.     BANK OPERATIONS
108.    As of March 31,  1986,  Mexico had  received 95 loans  from the Bank,
amounting to US$8.29 billion, net of cancellations and terminations; of these,
61 loans totalling US$4.0 billion were fully disbursed.  The Bank held US$6.63
billion, of which US$2.68 billion had not yet been disbursed. Some 40% of Bank
lending has been for agriculture and rural development, 20% for industry, 9%
for power, and 18% for transportation; the remaining 13% has been for water
supply, tourism, urban development, and vocational training. Annex II contains
a summary statement of Bank loans as of March 31, 1986.
109.     Of  the US$8.29 billion  total  lending,  about US$4.7 billion was for
establishing or strengthening institutions for channelling credit to areas
where credit supply was deficient or non-existent, and setting up in the com-
mercial banking system the ability to carry out project-related appraisal of
investments in agriculture, industry, and tourism.  These credit programs have
facilitated lending to low-income farmers and small- and medium-scale indus-
trial and tourism enterprises.
110.    The Government arranged adequate budget financing in the years 1978 to
1981, which significantly improved project implementation. Government and Bank
officials met periodically to review project implementation, and greater atten-
tion was focussed on project monitoring.  As a result of these measures, most



- 40 -
of the Bank-assisted projects were being implemented satisfactorily until mid-
1982, and disbursements rose from US$91 million in FY78 to US$448 million in
FY82.  However, the 1982 financial crisis again caused delays in the provision
of counterpart funds; consequently, disbursements in FY83 declined to US$389
million.  A Special Action Program (SAP) was established in early 1983 to help
the Government by alleviating the counterpart funding constraints on develop-
ment projects, and 18 Bank-financed projects are receiving support under the
Program.   Partly as a result of the SAP,  disbursenents during FY84 improved
significantly at US$528.87 million,  or 35% over disbursements  in 1983.   The
FY85 disbursement figure is US$787.93 million, 49% over 1984 or 100% over
projected.
B.     IFC OPERATIONS
111.   As of March 31, 1986, IFC had made investment commitments in 27 compa-
nies in Mexico, for a total of US$753.9 million, of which US$580.2 million had
been sold, repaid, or cancelled.   A summary statement of IFC investments  is
presented  in Annex II.   IFC has been working  together with  the Bank  to:
Wi) identify investment opportunities which would best suit the needs of the
Mexican private sector in the current phase of the stabilization program, and
vii) assist the Government in reviewing the requirements of the country's capi-
tal markets, both through economic sector work and specific proposals for ven-
ture capital operations. A US$100 million capital goods facility, approved in
1983, has yet to be used, and is, therefore, under review.  Subsequently, the
XFC has carried out three operations in the motor vehicle and cotton seed
business.   The provision of foreign exchange and export production have been
the principal objectives of these operations.
C.     DAIS STRATEGY
112.    The Bank's major objectives in Mexico prior to the 1982 crisis were to:
Ca) support policies and programs leading to a wider distribution of the bene-
fits of economic growth; (b) help finance projects that, directly or indirect-
ly, contributed significantly to output and employment; (c) help reduce
Mexico's urban/regional imbalances; and (d) help free bottlenecks which prevent
rapid growth.  These continue to be important objectives of Bank assistance to
Mexico. However, following the 1982 economic crisis and a reassessment of the
Bank's role in Mexico, the Bank Management concluded that:  Ca) increased Bank
lending, critical to Mexico's recovery, must be linked to central policy re-
forms; and (b) the Bank should play a central role in assisting Mexico's return
to voluntary lending. To prepare itsel. for this new role, the Bank has inten-
sified and broadened its economic and sector work.  Specific policy reforms
that are presently being pursued through a dialogue with the Mexican Government
cover priority macroeconomic and cross-sectoral issues, such as trade liberali-
zation, rationalization of preferential credit systems, improvement in public
sector  pricing,  and  investment  and  subsidy reduction.   Traditional  lending
incorporating project- or sector-specific policy issues will be conducted in
parallel with policy dialogue on cross-sectoral or macro policy issues.
113.      Because of the difficult structural problems of agriculture and the
sector's crucial importance for the one-third of the nation's population living
in rural areas, the Bank has made agriculture the leading sector for its



- 41 -
lending.   The Bank's agricultural  lending program in Mexico aims at:   (a) a
more efficient and rational use of natural resources to increase production;
(b) productivity improvements of cultivated lands, with emphasis on the
productivity of small farmers; and (c) promotion of employment-generating
investments in rural areas. To support these goals, infrastructure investments
in Bank-assisted projects have been complemented with support services, such as
extension, marketing programs,  and credit.   The Bank has made 10  loans  in
FYs8O-85 totalling US$1,566.0 million, for irrigation, rural and agricultural
investment projects, and agro-industrial and livestock credit programs. A loan
for a Second Tropical Agricultural Project was approved by the Executive
Directors on March 4, 1986.  Projects for irrigation rehabilitation, extension
and research, seed multiplication, forestry, agro-industries, and agricultural
credit are in various stages of preparation.  Special emphasis has been placed
in recent years on the development of rainfed areas.
114.     Bank lending for industry between FYs8O-85 amounted to US$947.3 mil-
lion, covering areas of small- and medium-scsae industry, mining, vocational
training, capital goods industries development, and export development. After
the 1982 crisis, a US$350 million loan was approved to assist in Mexico's non-
oil export drive. Based on the lessons of experience under that sector adjust-
ment operation and broad economic sector work carried out with the Government
recently, a new comprehensive assistance strategy was formulated to guide the
Bank's lending work for industry.   This strategy supports:   (a) trade policy
reform to move towards greater uniformity of incentives and greater interna-
tional competitiveness; (b) complementary financial sector policies to reverse
the prolonged contraction experienced by Mexico's financial system, including
its securities market; and (c) measures required to encourage adequate supply
responses, particularly through export promotion and industrial restructuring.
115.    Under the above strategy, the Bank is responding to the current needs
of Mexico's industrial sector.   A US$500 million Trade Policy Loan, that has
just been negotiated and would be presented for Board consideration together
with the proposed project, is aimed at supporting the trade liberalization pro-
cess through further reform measures and the provision of quick-disbursing
finance that is expected to facilitate the mobilization of commercial bank
funds for Mexico's external financing needs in 1986.   A US$48 million Indus-
trial Technology Development Loan is also scheduled for distribution to the
Board, which would help support technological innovation at the enterprise lev-
el and iLmprove technology services.   The Bank has already appraised a Second
Export Development Project, which would continue Bank assistance for increased
non-oil exports and policy reforms and provide finance to exporters.  In addi-
tion, substantive preparation work has been undertaken to assess the need for
financial and physical restruccuring in key industrial sectors and explore the
ways in which the Bank could support both parastatal and private enterprises.
Discussions are most advanced for Fertilizer Sector Adjustment and Public
Sector Management Technical Assistance operations.
116.      Bank  lending  for transport  has  focussed  on regional development,
strengthening of institutions, and rationalization of public investment outlays
and pricing policies.  Between FYs8O-85, six loans amounting to US$753.7 mil-
lion were approved, including two in each of the following three subsectors:
highways, railways, and ports. Additional projects to support the above goals



- 42 -
were undertaken in the urban sector. During FYs8O-85, four loans were approved
in the urban sector totalling US$408.5 million, in the fields of water supply
and sewerage and urban development.  Tvo urban projects were recently approved
by the Executive Directors: a Municipal Strengthening and a Solid Waste Pilot
Project.  An Earthqua'-. Rehabilitation Project was also approved on March 25,
1986.  Additional projects are under consideration in the transport and urban
sectors, aiming at strengthening the various institutions in the areas of
planning, management, and finance.
117.     The Economic Development Institute (EDI) is assisting Mexico through
various courses/seminars dealing with policy alternatives and institutional
reforms.   EDI training is specifically directed at courses/seminars on water
supply and sanitation sector management, transport policy, agricultural policy,
industrial development and finance, and macro policy analysis.
118.    The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) is the second largest source
of multilateral aid to Mexico.   The IDB has made loans to Mexico totalling
US$3.4 billion as of March 31, 1986.  Over 50% of the total has gone to agri-
cultural and rural development projects, and the balance to transportation,
industry, water supply and sewerage, tourism infrastructure, education, muni-
cipal development,  and preinvestment.   The IDB and the Bank have coordinated
their assistance on several projects.   Each has made loans  for the national
integrated rural development program (PIDER), agricultural and livestock cred-
it, small- and medium-scale industries development, and hotel development proj-
ects.   The  IDB  is also  providing  a program of assistance  for earthquake
rehabilitation and reconstruction.   The International Fund  for Agricultural
Development (IFAD) has approved a loan of US$22.0 million for a rural develop-
ment project in the State of Oaxaca, which was appraised by the Bank's staff
and for which the Bank is acting as cooperating institution for administering
the loan.
PART VI - RECOEElID&TION
119.    I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.

COVEIEIT'S STATEMENT OF FOREIGN TRADE POLICY
Three-and-a-half years ago the Government of Mexico faced a daunt-
ing challenge.   Highly expansive domestic fiscal policies,  in a context of
abundant international credit, had led to the buildup of enormous internal
and external disequilibria.   By  late 1982,  the country's  foreign exchange
reserves were almost totally depleted, and inflation soared to unprecedented
levels.
Accordingly, from its very first day in offic:e, the Government of
President De la Madrid undertook the task of overcoming, the crisis and build-
ing new and healthier foundations  for future economic development.   It was
postulated from the beginning of his Administration, that the achievement of
these goals is mainly the responsibility of the Mexican people and their
Government.   However,  it is also clear  that an important role has to be
played, and should continue to be played, by the country's foreign creditors.
The 1983-85 Stabilizatin Drive
During the first years of the present Administration, perhaps of
necessity,  the emphasis was mainly on stabilization.   In this domain,  the
Government's efforts went well during 1983 and 1984: a sharp fiscal adjust-
ment brought dowa. the deficit from 18X of GDP to 9%; inflation came down; the
current account was in surplus by US$4 billion per annum; and growth began to
pick up.
On the external debt side, several rescheduling exercises and fresh
money arrangements for Mexico were successfully undertaken since the eruption
of the crisis in August 1982.  These constitute an excellent example of what
an open and friendly dialogue between a debtor country and its creditors can
achieve, as long as proper adjustment policies are practiced by the debtor
and a propitious international environment prevails.
Recently, however, the notion has circulated that Mexico has aban-
doned, or at least significantly relaxed its stabilization efforts, even
among those who not long ago held a very sympathetic view towards the coun-
try's adjustment policies.   In  the interuational perception,  the Mexican
economy has seemed to go from "miracle" to "mirage."
This perception has stemmed mostly from various misunderstandings
of the recent performance of some macroeconomic variables, from an insuffi-
cient understanding of the structural reform process that began to build mo-
mentum after mid-1985, as well as from the faiture to recognize the extent to
which the external conditions have deteriorated lately for Mexico, thus
impairing the effectiveness of its domestic policies.

NEICO - GOVERNINT'S STATMENNT OF                                          ANN y
FOREIGN TRADE POLICY   (Jne 19, 1986)                               Page r2of
Perhaps the most relevant aspect is the balance of payments adjust-
ment.   The improvement in the country's external accounts during 1983-85
should be an undisputed fact. Over thls period, the trade account accumulat-
ed a surplus of US$35 billion, while the current account registered a surpluo
of US$10 billion, in spite of the size of the interest bill on the foreign
debt. The adjustment implied by these figures can be better assessed in the
light of the experience of previous years--in 1981, for instance, the current
account deflcit reached US$12.5 billion--and if it is remembered that not
even during the years of price and financial stability in the late 50's and
the 60's was it possible to achieve positive balances in either account.
It is sometimes stated that the praiseworthy efforts of 1983-84
were spoiled by a slackening of the external adjustment during 1985.  It is
true that both trade and current accounts, as well as international reserves,
deteriorated over this last year, but to a significant extent this occurred
because of conditions well beyond the influence of domestic economic policy.
Oil exports, for one thing, suffered a 10% decrease in average price and a 6%
drop in volume during 1985. The fall in oil revenues alone explains one-half
of the decrease experienced by the current account surplus during 1985.
Exports of other primary products, whose performance is determined more by
external than by internal variables, also suffered a setback.   The only
factor Influenced by domestic policies contributing significantly to a sal-
ler trade balance was the rapid growth of merchandise imports by the private
sector--mostly intermediate and investment goods-a situation that did not
appear alarming, given that imports had registered very low levels for three
consecutive years.
More importantly, however, the Government adopted firm policies in
reaction to the weakening balance of payments.  On the one hand, these in-
cluded exchange rate and other short-term policy adjustments.   On the other
hand, they involved also structural reforms, especially an acceleration of
the Government 's long-term program of trade liberalization and export
promotion.
The Government intends to continue the process of trade liberaliza-
tion, despite the adverse external trade conditions faced by Mexico as a re-
sult of the fall in oil prices. But the Government is acutely aware that its
trade policy objectives cannot be achieved unless there is an appropriate
macropolicy context in support of trade liberalization, combined with indus-
trial and other sectoral reconversion efforts and a supportive external fi-
nancing program. The following sections will spell out each of these inter-
related policy and financing objectives and requirements.
The Trade Policy Program for 1986-88
The current recovery in manufactured exports is occurring upon
structural bases that are different from those prevailing in the past.  In
compliance with the National Development Plan in effect since mid-1983, the
Mexican Government adopted throughout 1985 a number of measures to liberalize
a historically protectionist trade regime and thus reduce the consequent

FOREIGN TRADE POLICY   (June 19, 1986)                                Page 3 of 18
anti-export bias that has prevailed in the Mexican economy for many decades.
Furtlhermore, in order to accelerate the effect of opening up the economy in
the export sector, a number of measures have been taken to make sure that all
potential exporters have access to inputs at international prices.   To this
end, a modern drawback system was established in April 1985, and the system
of temporary imports for exporters has been repeatedly subject to further
liberalization.   It is also important to mention that Mexico last November
initiated formal negotiations to become a member of the GATT.
Strategic Reform Objectives of Commercial Policy.   The principles
and objectives of Mexico's foreign trade policy have been clearly set forth
in published plans and programs, which indicate the strategy to be followed
to regain the ability to grow and improve the quality of development.
These documents recognize that the import-substitution model used
as a development strategy for the Mexican economy for more than four decades
has been exhausted.   While  this model  led to rapid  industrialization and
raised employment and output, it also produced side effects that gradually
made it rigid and impracticable, caused distortions in resource allocation,
discouraged economic efficiency, induced high external dependence, and pro-
moted both higher costs and higher profits for domestically-oriented produc-
tion to the detriment of production for export.
in view of this, the present Administration adopted a strategy of
economic reorganization and structural change designed to eliminate rigidi-
ties in the economy, while achieving sustained growth.  In the foreign trade
area, the structural change is intended to ensure that non-oil exports will
cover an increasing share of the import requirements of the Mexican economy.
The National Development Plan (PND), the National Program for
Industrial Promotion and Foreign Trade (PRONAFICE), and the Comprehensive
Export Promotion Program (PROFIEX) are mutually complementary, and all of
them agree that the primary objective of Mexico's foreign trade will be to
balance, expand, and diversify commercial relations on the basis of continu-
ally expanding non-oil exports and efficient selective substitution of im-
ports. A major feature of the policy to be pursued is a change away from an
import substitution strategy aimed at the domestic market and based on a
rigid protectionist structure, towards a policy of export promotion and
greater external competitiveness, through a gradual opening up to foreign
trade.
To achieve these objectives, protection levels must gradually be
rationalized in order to expose Mexican industry to increased competition
from abroad.  This will induce it to make the structural adjustments neces-
sary to improve the utilization of available resources and foster the crea-
tion of a productive system capable of competing with foreign goods on a firm
footing.
The policy of rationalization of protection is aimed at reducing
protection levels, avoiding the anti-export bias of the past, and establish-
ing a policy structure based mainly on tariffs, rather than import licenses,

and thus permitting more precise measurement of the actual degree of protec-
tion granted.
Evaluation of Trade Policy under the Present Administration.   In
late 1982 the economic crisis made it necessary to adopt drastic macro-
economic adjustment measures, including exchange devaluations, austerity in
public expenditure, and widespread import controls.
In these circumstances, trade policy instruments continued to be
applied during 1983 with the main objectives of correcting the imbalances of
the balance of payments, rationing the use of foreign exchange, and keeping
the productive system in operation.  This was sought essentially through the
use of import licenses and exchange controls. In addition, tariffs were set
with a view to reducing their inflationary impact,  as reflected  in the
decline in the average tariff by 3 percentage points between 1982 and 1983,
to 24Z.
Starting in 1984 with the publication of PRONAFICE, the design of
foreign trade policy began to focus on a rationalization of protection. The
process of replacing import licenses by tariffs was begun, and during the
year the license requirement was abolished for 2,844 tariff items (about a
third of the total number of items), representing 16.5% of total import value
and comprising mainly needed industrial inputs not produced domestically.
In addition, tariff policy also aimed at reducing the dispersion of
tariffs, preventing price speculation in the domestic market, and simplifying
tariff application by cutting the number of rates.  By end-1984, the number
of tariff rates had declined from 13 to 10, and tariff dispersion had fallen
from 23.8 to 22.5.
Although these measures had only limited impact in changing the
production structure during 1984--as the elimination of import licenses
during that year was aimed primarily at reactivating the productive system,
they did lay the foundations for a more intensive application of the policy
in 1985.
The two funtdamental measures toward rationalizing protection in
1985 were the elimination of import licenses and the tariff reorganization.
The original intention was to phase out the control of items that had not
been decontrolled in 1984 on three different dates:   727 items, accounting
for 10.3% of total imports, would remain under control until October 31,
1985; 3,508 items, representing 35.1% of import value, would be decontrolled
by October 31, 1986; and, finally, 965 items, with a 37.1% share in import
value, would remain controlled until October 31, 1989.
Nonetheless, these targets were accelerated on July 25, 1985.  At
present only 391 tariff items of those which were to remain subject to con-
trol until October 31, 1985 and 1986, and representing 12% of overall
imports,  still remain under control.    Also,  only  414 of the  965 items

FOREIGN TRADE POLICY   (June 19, 1986)                              Page 35oTf T
originally scheduled for decontrol in October 1989 still remain under con-
trol, representing 232 of import value.   This means that 551 items in this
group have been exempted from the license requirement.
These July 25 adjustments were made in order to face the growing
deterioration of the domestic and external situation, and thus to avold
increasing inflationary pressures and improve the export capacity of Mexican
industry.  To this end, the number of decontrolled items was increased to
7,159 (90% of all items), which account for 62% of total import value Cbased
on 1984 figures).   This means that the protection system has now shifted
towards the use of tariffs, which apply to goods ranging from raw materials
to highly processed products manufactured by both public and private
enterprises.
The liberalization dld not extend to all General Import Tariff
(TIGI) items.  A total of 909 items still remain subject to the import li-
cense requirement, due to the national interest in protecting certain sectors
and preventing wasteful imports of luxury goods.
The substitution of tariffs for licenses was accompanied by the
adoption of generally higher tariff rates, to avoid a sudden and disruptive
removal of protection and instead phase in the tariff gradually, after more
than 40 years of quantitative restrictions.  In net terms, tariffs have been
increased to date for 1,252 items (2,036 tariffs were raised and 784 were
lowered), but only 19% of total imports in value terms have been affected, as
is reflected in the fact that the import-weighted average tariff increased
from 8.6% to 12.3X.
The tariffs in effect for about 95% of TIGI items are thought ade-
quate to the structure established on the basis of the criteria adopted until
now (degree of processing, kind of product, and priority of use or destina-
tion) to begin the programmed tariff reduction.   This means that a small
amount of tariff reorganization still remains to be completed.  The current
structure should be seen as a tool that has been useful for the stage of
transition from licenses to tariffs.
Through rate unification and the elimination of the tariff "saw,"
these changes yielded a more homogenous tariff structure, but did not alter
the tariff dispersion.   In addition, they resulted in a broader use of the
25% and 40% levels, whose coverage increased from 1,946 items in January 1985
to 3,117 items today, representing a change of from 7% to 23% in value terms.
The progress made under the protection rationalization policy in
July 1985 means that the greatest possible trade openness has been achieved
for now. Since that time, adjustments have been made to eliminate inconsis-
tencies and discrepancies that went unnoticed at the time tariffs were sub-
stituted for import licenses.
These recent adjustments have further reduced the number of items
subject to the import license requirement (818), bringing their share in

total import value down to 35%. Also, the increase in the 25% and 40% tariff
rates was offset by eliminating the 75% rate and reducing the use of the 100%
rate.
After these changes, the TIGI now contains 8,100 items, distributed
among 9 tariff rates.   Items subject to tariffs ranging from 0% to 25%
account for 86% of total import value, as reflected In the low weighted
tariff (12%).  The largest rate classes in terms of number of items are the
10%, 25%, and 40% groups, which together Include 78X of all items.  It is
worth noting that although the 40% tariff Includes 23% of all Items, it
covers only 9% of total import value.
Guiding Principles of Trade Policy.  The goal of having the Mexican
economy penetrate world markets by promoting its productive efficiency has
been retained for the period 1986-88.  Despite an unfavorable international
environment, especially as regards the oil market, it has been decided to
continue making structural changes that strengthen the country's development
capeacity.   Therefore, firm action will continue to be taken  to make the
industrial structure more efficient, rationalize the excessive level of
protection, and increase the export capacity.
As the President of the Republic stated in this regard in his
message to the Nation on February 21, 1986:
... Domestic economic policy cannot change either in its basic
objectives or in its adopted strategy.  Both before and after
the oil crisis, the basic problems of our economy remain the
same.   The additional obstacles we are meeting today do not
change the nature of those problems.   ... We are still faced
with the need to adjust the economy by making in-depth struc-
tural changes to strengthen our development capacity."
"We will continue to pursue our firm efforts to rehabilitate
the public finances, to make the industrial system more effi-
cient, to rationalize the excessive level of protection, to
increase the Nation's capacity to generate foreign exchange
through diversified exports and enhanced tourism, to make firm
progress in decentralization, and to raise productivity in
agriculture,  fishing,  forestry,  mining,  and  the  service
sectors, that is, in transportation, commerce, the financial
system, and, of course, the government itself."
With these goals in mind, further progress will be made in the
rationalization of the protection system through the use of tariffs instead
of quantitative restrictions, seeking to increase exposure to external
competition and to reduce the bias against exports and primary activities.
To ensure continued progress of the protection rationalization
policy, gradual, transparent, nondiscriminatory measures are planned both in
the area of tariffs and in the intention to retain only a minimum of quanti-
tative restrictions.

FOREIGN TRADE POLICY   (Jue 19, 1986)                               Page 7 of 18
The gradualism of the program is designed to reduce the uncertainty
caused by sudden changes and to grant industry enough time to make the
adjustments needed to adapt to the new conditions of openness to inter-
national competition.
In addition, incentives must be made more uniform, especially by
means of a tariff structure containing fewer rates and less dispersion,
through the adoption of general tariff levels for categories of goods based
on their type, degree of processing, etc. To this end, the trade policy will
focus basically on the objectives of industrial protection, operating effi-
ciency of the productive system, and increased export generation.
As indicative guidelines for policy, the Government will regularly
monitor levels and dispersion of effective protection, with a view to reduc-
ing the differential between maximum and minimum rates.
The tariff levels will determine the level of protection deemed
desirable for a given domestic line of production and will be equal for
products having the same characteristics.   Producers and sectors deemed of
priority to the economy and requiring greater protection for a time in order
to become established in accordance with current development programs will be
granted this protection in the form of temporary tariff surcharges not
exceeding 50% of the basic tariff rate, thus favoring the use of transparent
tariff protection over quantitative restrictions.
To back up the protection given by the tariff, it is necessary to
continue applying mechanisms to prevent unfair external competition from
affecting the protection structure, damaging domestic industry, and distort-
ing the application of the trade policy.
Trade Policy Measures for 1986-88.  In his message of February 21,
the President of the Republic also announced 10 points that will support the
economic policy measures taken to deal with the Nationls present situation.
One of them is that "we will continue to go further ln revising the protec-
tion system through additional progress in tariff policy and resorting as
little as possible to quantitative restrictions." As he also noted, "We will
continue negotiations for accession to GATT, with a view to having a broad
framework in which to promote our trade relations with the rest of the
world."
During the period 1986-88, the protection rationalization policy
will continue to be consistent, with the objective of gradually opening the
Mexican economy to the rest of the world, while avoiding exposing the produc-
tive system to sudden shocks from foreign competition that would cause
unemployment or discourage investment. More precisely, this policy will help
strengthen the export capacity of domestic industry, mobilize a larger share
of existing productive resources, and make more efficient use of them.
The trade policy measures adopted in 1985 represented a significant
qualitative change in the system of protection, as never before had so large
a proportion of total imports been exempt from licenses as today.

MEXICO - GOVERNMENT'S STATHMENT OF                                        ANNEX IV
FOuEIGN TRADE POLICY   (June 19, 1986)                              PBge I of 18
The potential for continuing the substitution of tariffs for import
licenses in the short term will depend on a careful selection of specific
sectors and products whose imports must be handled under the import license
system for structural or legal reasons--whether because of economic and
social priority (as in the case of some agrlcultural products) or because of
public interest or strategic considerations (as in the case of products harm-
ful to health, arms and munitions, and the petroleum sector, among others).
These reasons are discussed in the letter of instructions for
accession to GATT, written by the President of the Republic to the Secretary
of Commerce and Industrial Development on November 22, 1985, which states:
"The protocol of accession must be fully consistent with the
provisions of the Political Constitution of United Mexican
States and of all other laws safeguarding the effectiveness
and exercise of the Nation's sovereignty.  Our sovereignty
over natural resources, and energy resources ln particular,
must be fully respected during the negotiations.  Products
affecting national security or public health, as well as
agricultural products sensitive to the national economy,
should not be considered in the negotiations."
Import licenses are now no longer required for 90.0% of TIGI items,
covering  65.2% of  total  imports.    As  for  the  agricultural  sector  in
particular, 85.0% of its tariff items do not require import licenses, and the
great mejority of agricultural imports still covered by licenses are duty-
free basic necessities of the population.   Even so, further progress can be
made in abolishing import licenses, especially in the capital goods sector.
As regards Mexico's entry into GATT, the Presidernt's instructions
state thtc "Mexico must play an active role in international economic nego-
tiations" and that 'it is in the national interest to initiate proceedings
leading towards Mexico's accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade."
This decision is founded on four basic reasons mentioned in the
same document: "... the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade offers Mexico
not only the possibility of better access for its exports, but also the
provisions necessary to protect its productive system and employment;" "
Mexico is offered one more instrument for the peaceful resolution of disputes
and for the defense of our commercial interests;" and " ... that Mexico make
use of the possibility of actively participating in this forum for purposes
of its own industrial reconversion process."
The work of the Commission on Tariffs and Foreign Trade Restric-
tions will focus on continuing the rationalization of the structure of
protection in a way that will bring the operating environment of Mexican
industry closer to that of other countries at a similar level of development.

The prior import license system will be reviewed twice a year to
eliminate quantitative control. to the greatest  practicable extent.   This
review will exclude Items pertaining to the agricultural, petroleum, pharma-
ceutleals, autoootlve and computer sectors, as well as products harmful to
health or strategic to national defense, since these are covered by specific
legislation and involve speclal economic and social considerations.
Also, import licenses for luxury consumer goods cannot be abolished
at this  time, due  to the  political  impact and the scarcity of foreign
exchange in the current economic situation.   Nevertheless, prohibitions on
Imports of some consumer goods will be eliminated during 1986 and replaced by
quotas, which would be enlarged over time, If conditions permit.
A preliminary estimate shows that approximately 176 items--mainly
capital goods, chemicals, rubber and plastic products, edible oils and fats,
and paper and cardboard--ay be exempted from the license requirement by not
later than September 30, 1987.
A program of gradual tariff reduction, generally appllcable to all
sectors but allowing for the possibility of differential treatment for duly
accredited sectors, is the most appropriate way to pursue the protection
rationalization policy and to eliminate the excessive protection now granted
to certain sectors.
A timetable is proposed for reducing the tariffs for items covering
locally manufactured products, involving reductions every 10 months, starting
from April 30, 1986, as shown in the following table:

This procedure will yield a fLve-rate tariff structure by October
31,  1988, distributed as follows:   exempt and lOX for goods not produced
locally or produced In insufficient quantity, depending on their priority and
taking Into account the fact that the zero rate wlll apply to raw materials

For productive industries or specific sectors deemed of priority or
special importance to the national economy under present or future developr
ment programs and which require additional protection for a time in order to
get established, such protection will be granted through temporary tariff
surcharges not to exceed 50% of the base tariff rate set for the product.
Similarly, the Federal Government reserves the right to establish a 50% base
tariff rate, under exceptional domestic or international economic circum-
stance, for certain activities justifying a special level of protection.
The targets set for further sabstitution of licenses by tariffs and
for the tariff reduction program were made public on April 30, 1986 in order
to remove uncertainty and allow the productive system to make investment,
production, and pricing plans, and to give it adequate time to make the
adjustments necessary to face competition from abroad.
The tariff reduction process now begun will be continued in a
gradual and homogenous manner, in order to prevent speculative practices and
the development of expectations that could hinder its success.  Moreover,
preannouncement of these measures and their timing reduces uncertainty in the
productive system and provides it with sufficient time to make the necessary
adjustments in its production plans. The time required for such adjustments,
including acquisition of machinery and know-how, plant design, relocation,
and the like, usually ranges from two to five years.

MEXICO - GOVflUMEZ'S StATEMENT OF                                        ANNM     I
FOREIGN TRADE POLICY   (June 19, 1986)                              Page 11 of 18
A first step in the tariff reduction process was the publication of
a Presidential Decree implementing actions scheduled for April 30, 1986.  It
introduced changes affecting 4,580 tariff items, of whlch 4,282 are tariff
reductions.
In general, items previously subject to the 20%, 25%, and 30% rates
had their tariff level cut by 2.5 percentage points.  In addition, the 100Z
rate was abolished, and all items previously subject to it were reduced by up
to 45% and brought together with those formerly subject to the 50Z tariff.
The decree also did away with the 5% rate.  Of the 325 items that
were dutied at this rate, 297 were raised to 10%, and the remainder was
exempted from the import tax.  Thus, the relief process excluded those items
currently exempted from tariff and those dutied at the 10% rate.
The 4,580 items included in the published decree cover 36.1% of
total imports, and, as a result of these changes, there will be a decrease of
slightly less than 2 percentage points in both the average tariff and the
tariff dispersion, while the tariff weighted by 1985 imports will decline by
one-half percentage point.
Official import reference prices will continue to be used as until
now to combat unfair foreign trade practices until December 1987, s0 as to
avoid the risk of damage to local industry from such practices, while setting
up the data bank and infrastructure needed to bring into full operation the
new countervailing duty mechanism established by the Foreign Trade Law. This
data bank will be created to collect the international experience needed to
permit implementation of the countervailing duty mechanism, with the support
of the services of an internationally reputed firm in the area of customs
valuation.
The existence of unfair trade practices in the international market
justifies retaining a streamlined, obstacle-free handling of the reference
price system, while rapidly implementing the countervailing duty mechanism
set up by the new Foreign Trade Law of 1985. To this end, the implementing
regulations for this Law will be put into effect before September 1986.
At present, 1,171 tariff  items are  subject  to official import
reference prices, covering 8.4% of total 1985 imports.   This is a smaller
number than the 1,348 items covered by Import reference prices at the start
of 1985.
Import reference prices will be reviewed every three months with a
view to eliminating redundant protection, such as in the case of items simul-
taneously subject to import licenses, high tariffs, and reference prices, or
the case of recorded import prices that exceed the official reference price.
In normal circumstances, reference prices will not at any time apply to more
than 10% of the total value of imports. Moreover, the reference prices will
be analyzed in the second half of 1986 in the light of progress achieved in
implementing the countervailing duty mechanisms, to establish the possibility
of a gradual disappearance of reference prices as this new system comes Into
application.

Lastly, during the second halE of 1986, Mexico will announce its
intention to adapt its nomenclature to that of the Harmonized Commodity
Description and Coding Sytem, replaning the current Customs Cooperation
Council Nomenclature, as from January 1, 1988, as befits its position as
candidate for accession to GATT and the fact that the future rounds of multi-
lateral negotiations within GATT will take place under the nomenclature of
the Harmonized System.  The new system will not only permit better identifi-
cation, but will also facilitate trade flows with the rest of the world.
The Hacropolicy Framework for Trade Liberalization
As early as December 1984, the daily devaluation of the controlled
exchange rate was increased--this rate applies to about 80% of all foreign
exchange transactions,  including all merchandise trade.   The procedure was
repeated after the price of crude fell in February 1985.
A few months later even more drastic measures were implemented. On
July 11, the Mexican commercial banks were allowed to operate in the free
foreign exchange market through their own bureaus of exchange.   This action
sought to broaden the free foreign exchange market in order to make it less
prone to excessive instability.   Less than two weeks later, the controlled
exchange rate was devaluated by 20%, and a new system of managed float--
instead of the preannounced rate of crawl--was implemented.
These policy adjustments have enabled the free and controlled
exchange rates to exercise a more flexible and timely equilibrating function
of the external sector of the economy.   In real terms,  the free and con-
trolled rates depreciated significantly during 1985.   Not surprisingly,  in
view of the evolution of oil prices, real devaluation has continued during
the present year. Consequently, as of the end of last April, the controlled
exchange rate--the relevant one for foreign trade--had been devalued in real
terms by 20% as compared to the end of 1983, when it was correctly deemed
undervalued by most analysts, as proven by the fact that during 1984 the Bank
of Mexico's international reserves grew by US$3.2 billion.
Enhanced flexibility has also narrowed the differential between the
free and controlled  rates.   At  the beginning  of  the  two-tier system  in
December 1982, the differential was as wide as 50%.   During the first five
months of 1986 it averaged only 2.5%.
The reaction of the trade and service flows to the adjustment of
real exchange rates and other macroeconomic variables is already evident.
Exports of manufactured goods grew at an annual rate of 10% during the last
four months of 1985, and at the rate of 17.5% in the first quarter of this
year. During the latter period, the value of merchandise imports has fallen
at an annual rate of 6.5%.  Value added by in-bond industries and net income
from tourism are also expanding very dynamically.
It is the Government's intention to maintain the enhanced flexi-
bility of exchange rate policy, with a view to maintaining export competi-
tiveness and adequate reserves and avoiding the reimposition of quantitative
import restrictions for balance of payments purposes.

MNICO - GOVERNNEUT'S ST&TENEWE OF                                        ANNE   IV
VOEEIGN TRADE POLICY   (June 1_9 1986)                              Page TS13Tf
Another major component of the macropolicy framework that is needed
to ensure the success of the trade liberalization process is adequate fiscal
policy.  This is another lssue on which international perceptions have been
adverse.   It is widely believed that a relaxation of the fiscal adjustment
effort of 1983-84 began to occur In the last months of 1984.
Indeed, the conventional fiscal targets were significantly over-
ridden in 1985.
Last year, the target for the overall fiscal deficit as a propor-
tion of GOP called for a maximum of 5.1Z.  In practice, that proportion
reached 1OZ.   The  fall in oil income,  the difficulties involved in the
further reduction of public expenditure after two years of strong fiscal
austerity--a circumstance severely complicated by the September earthquakes,
and  the  persistence  of  higher-than-expected  inflation,  which  greatly
increased interest payments on the domestic public debt: all these are among
the determining factors in the adverse budgetary outcome of 1985.
The task of restructuring public finances in Mexico is far from
over, and the Mexican Government-notwithstanding adverse internal and exter-
nal conditions--continues working very actively to that end.  At the same
time, however, it is believed that by focussing on the overall fiscal
deficit, observers of the Mexican economy may overlook the magnitude of the
underlying fiscal adjustment accomplished since 1983.
The overall fiscal deficit, as a measure of the pressure exerted by
the public sector on aggregate demand and the external balance, has a funda-
mental  deficiency  under  high-inflation  conditions.    To  elucidate  this
problem, it may be useful to recall that nominal interest payments on any
credit have two components: first, the real payment; and second, the nominal
payment necessary to keep the real value of the credit intact. Economically
speaking, the inflation induced component constitutes a payment of principal,
not of real intetest, and it tends to be many times greater than the real
interest component when inflation is high.
Therefore, in an inflationary economy a serious implication of this
phenomenon is that very substantial payments of principal on the public
debt--hidden as interest payments-are computed as part of public current
expenditure.   Consequently, the overall fiscal deficit, that in principle
should measure only net borrowing requirements, in an inflationary situation
includes financing undertaken simply to roll over past liabilities.   This
procedure is as misleading as if, at the corporate level, payments of debt
were computed as current outlays.
Consequently, it has been suggested by various analysts, and put
into practice in some instances, that a better concept of public sector
deficit is one that excludes the inflation-induced component of interest
payments.   This concept, known as the operational deficit, does provide a
true measure of the net additional borrowing requirements of the public
sector and its size determines the evolution of the stock of public debt in
real terms.

FOEEIGI TRADE POLICY   (Jum. 19, i986)                               Page 14 of 18
It is oE interest to note how this operational deficit has evulved
in Mexico during the last few years.   It averaged about 1% of GDP in the
period 1978-80, and jumped to 3.62 in 1981-82.  Over the period 1983-85, it
has averaged less than 1% of CDP?  We should also add that as a consequence
of the oil price drop a number of measures have already been undertaken by
the Mexican Administration to reduce real government expenditure further and
increase non-oil fiscal revenues, so that the operational deficit substan-
tially disappears in 1986.  This result should be reviewed in the light of
the oil export earnings to be lost during the current year estimated at about
5Z ot GDP.   In other words,  had  the loss not occurred,  Mexico would be
running a substantial operational surplus.
Logically, the counterpart of the 1983-85 performance of the opera-
tional deficit was a reduction in the real size of the public debt.  During
this period, both the external public debt, in constant value dollars, and
the internal public debt, in constant value pesos, diminished by almost 5%.
While the operational deficit more accurately reflects fiscal ef-
foL by the Government, nonetheless the Government fully recognizes that it
is the full nominal deficit that must be financed and that it therefore
remains critical to the objective of reducing inflation.
The Government's fiscal program for 1986-88,i/ as detailed in
Table 1, presently envisages substantial further fiscal adjustment effort to
bring inflation under control and to reduce overall public sector borrowing
requirements to less than 42 of GDP by 1988.
Industrial and Other Sectoral Reconversion ProsraoJ
The process of gradual opening of the Mexican economy will bring
about a major shift in the structure of incentives and relative prices, and
will therefore require commensurate adjustments in the patterns of produc-
tion, investment, and employment.  To facilitate these adjustments,  the Gov-
ernment has begun to implement a series of programs of reconversion of the
principal sectors that will be affected by the change in the trade policy
environment. The industrial sector is a primary area of reconversion efforts
now under way, but the agricultural sector will be a major beneficiary of the
reduced anti-export bias and will also need reconversion assistance in order
to exploit the expected new opportunities for exports.
The Government's industrial reconversion strategy is aimed at both
large parastatal enterprises and support for private industrial firms in need
of adjustment assistance.   In the parastatal sector, the Government has al-
ready implemented programs to restructure FERTIMEX (fertilizers), SIDERKEX
(steel), railroads,  shipbuilding, and sugar.  Additional restructuring pro-
grams are under review for other industrial subsectors and the relevant para-
statals.   Some 278 smaller  parastatal  firms are  in the process of being
merged, privatized, or closed, with agreements already completed for the sale
of 112 firms.
I/         It should be emphasized that the specific quantitative targets of
the Government's present fiscal program are continually under
review and may be subject to further adjustments.

FOREIGN TRADE POLICY   (June 19, 1986)                                 Page 15 of 18
In the agricultural sector, the Government has progressed consider-
ably in the restructuring of CONASUPO (farm and food subsidies), and plans
are under review for the restructuring of BANRURAL (the Government rural
bank).  In addition, the private sector is increasingly participating in the
importation and commercialization of some agricultural goods that were previ-
ously subject to state monopoly.
Internal trade and price controls are being splectively relaxed or
eliminated in both the industrial and agricultural sectors, and further
progress in this area is expected to accompany the external liberalization
process, so as to facilitate the gradual conversion of domestic and
international prices.
The External Fimancin Progra for 1986-88
As is well known, Mexico is presently subject to an external shock
that could easily prove to be the biggest in at least half a century.  Last
January, oil prices started to drop sharply.   The current average price for
Mexican crude is about 53% less  than it was at the end of 1985.   Export
volume has also decreased significantly.   if the present situation continues
during 1986, the country will lose about US$7.5 billion in oil exports
revenue compared to last year and almost US$10 billioe. with respect to 1983.
A conservative estimate would put LU.e size of this external shock in the
vicinity of 5% of GDP.
Considering the dimension of the oil shock, it is obvious that the
country's current account perspectives are somewhat adverse for the near
future, in spite of all efforts to promote non-traditional exports and sub-
stitute imports.  A loss of revenue as big as the one caused by the collapse
of oil prices cannotp in the short-run, be fully compensated by increased
exports and reduced imports alone.
For this reason three months apo the Mexican authorities started
consultations with the country's creditors, their respective monetary author-
ities and with international agencies, to arrange a suitable financing pack-
age as quickly as possible.   Such a request  is warranted not only by the
gravity of the situation, but also by the way in which the economy was ad-
justed during the three previous years, is being adjusted at the present
time, and shall continue to be adjusted in the future.
Relying partially on a moderate increase in external indebtness to
absorb the oil shock cannot be considered an unwise policy, if one takes into
account that Mexico, for three consecutive years, far from increasing, has
reduced the size of its external debt  in real terms.   In support of this
view, consider that during the period 1983-85 the net flow of external
indebtedness--inclusive of changes in suppliers credits--was of US$3.0
billion, which is only slightly more than one-fifth of what would have been
required to keep the total external debt at the same level of December of
1982 in terms of constant value dollars.2/

1985)  estimate  of US$4.0 billion.   The original estimate was based on an
expected average price of crude of US$22.50 per barrel for 1986, whereas the
revised financing program assumes an average price of US$12.30.  The original
projection of total oil revenue  for 1986 was US$13.6  billion,  down  from
US$14.8 billion in 1985.   Instead, the revised estimate of total oil export
revenue for 1986 is US$6.2 billion, a decline from the original projection of
US$7.4 billion.   Thus,  while expected oil export revenue has declined by
US$7.4 billion, the revised projections of financing requirements have
increased by only US$1.3 billion.   Evidently, a significant part of the oil
revenue shortfall is being compensated for by policy adjustments and domestic
effort to increase non-oil exports, reduce imports, and economize on inter-
national reserves, added to the drop in nominal international interest rates.
Net financing needs decline gradually to US$4.9 billion in 1987 and
to US$4.5 billion in 1988, on the assumption of continued domestic effort and
an international price of crude that improves slowly from US$12.3 per barrel
in 1986 to US$13.0 in 1987, and US$15.0 in 1988.
Conclusion
The present Mexican economic situation does not fulfill the favor-
able expectations that Mexico and the internatinnal financial community had a
couple of years ago. The achievements, however, are by no means negligible,
if seen in the context of the extremely adverse external conditions.   The
Mexican terms of trade have deteriorated by 452 since December 1982, whereas
real interest rates on our foreign debt, although lower than they were, have
remained high by any historical standard.
It is a fact that Mexico has paid a high price for having to adjust
under  such difficult  external conditions.   Real GDP per capita and real
average wages in 1986 will certainly be substantially below the levels
attained five years ago.  It cannot be taken lightly that the deterioriation
in the Mexican standard of living has coexisted with a situation in which the
process of servicing responsibly our foreign debt has implied an enormous
transfer of resources to the creditor countries.
Fiscal discipline and structural adjustment are not new concepts to
Mexico. Making them part of the strategy to solve the crisis that erupted in
1982 was a sovereign decision adopted more than three years ago.  In living
up to this decision, the Mexican Government has undertaken very courageous
and unprecedented actions.   However it is expected  that creditors,  their
respective monetary authorities, and the international agencies lend their
support to the resolution of this problem as well, and thereby contribute
significantly to the realization of these goals.
3/    The specific quantitative targets of the Government's presently pro-
posed external financing plan are continually under review and may be
subject to further adjustments.

MEMORANDUM ON METHODOLOGY
MEASURENINT OF TRADE POLICY TARGETS AND OBJECTIVES
(June 25, 1986)
DOMESTIC OUTPUT WEIGETING FACTORS FOR IMPORT TARIFF ITEKS
1.     Background
1.        Traditionally,  the Government  of Mexico has  regulated  imports
through a combined system of tariffs and permits.  The degree of restric-
tiveness of this system has undergone variations, principally in terms of
the balance of payments situation.   At the end of the 70s,  for example,
when there was a hard currency surplus because of income from oil exports,
import restrictions were relatively relaxed.  But in September 1982, when
the country experienced the greatest payments crisis in its modern history,
all  imports were subjected  to the requirement of prior permits, and no
permits were granted unless strictly necessary to keep productive capacity
in operation.
2.       In recent years,  there has been growing recognition that import
restrictions are not the most appropriate instrument to resolve problems
relating to the balance of payments.  Even if this policy may be the most
effective one to bring about a swift reduction in the outflow of reserves,
it creates a discriminatory, discretionary, and intransparent structure of
incentives to internal production, which, in the long run, has resulted in
an overprotected and unresponsive production system that is not competitive
with foreign producers.
3.       These are the chief considerations that in July 1985 prompted a
significant change in trade policy.   For the first time in the country's
history a significant liberalization of the import regime was decreed at a
time when  the balance  of payments  prospects  were  far from reassuring.
Before the reforms of the system, 4,513 out of 8,077 items were subject to
the prior permit requirement.  Of the 4,153, items, 3,604 were liberalized
on July 25, leaving only 909 under control, through which 38% of the value
of total imports (1984 figures) were channeled.
4.      At the same time, it was realized that the most appropriate way of
achieving equilibrium in the external balance did not consist of restrict-
ing imports through permits and tariffs, but in adjusting the exchange
rate. This was made explicit with the devaluation of the peso simultaneous
to the freeing of imports and the announcement of the official intention to
pursue further trade liberalization.

MEXICO - MEMORANDUM ON METHODOLOGY                                      ANNEX V
(June 25, 1986)                                                     Page 2 of 8
5.      The Government's program of trade liberalization calls for new ways
of measuring the degree to which the import regime has been liberalized, in
order to better design, monitor, and give increased trinsparency to the
Government's trade policy targets and objectives.   This Memorandum des-
cribes some alternatives in this connection, and a system of measurement
based on weighting factore of domestic output is defined.
2.     Measuring Degree of the Openness of the Trade Regime
a.     Simple Averaging
6.     There are several ways of quantifying the advances of the liberali-
zation program.   With respect to control through prior permits, the most
obvious one is to simply report the number of tariff items that are subject
to this restriction.  For example, the reforms of last year freed 3,604 of
the 4,513 controlled items out of a total of 8,077 items, leaving 909
controlled. Similarly, the simple average of the tariff rates of the items
can be used to obtain an indicator of the restrictiveness of tariffs.
1.     However, these methods in no way account for the relative importance
of each of the items, for the same weight is attributed to algae as to
crude oil or to sodium citrate.  It would thus be easy to give the appear-
ance of considerable liberalization in items of little importance in terms
of shares in trade or output.
b.     Weighted Averaging based on Imports
8.      In light of the foregoing,  it is necessary to find a method that
accounts for the relative importance of each item through a system of
weighting  factors.    For  exarple,  one  could  use  the  value  of  imports
channeled through each item during a certain period.  Under this procedure,
the indicator for the coverage of permits is no longer the number of
controlled items, but the share, in the value of imports accounted for by
these  items;  and,  for  the  tariffs,  the  indicator  is  the  average
import-weighted tariff, instead of the unweighted tariff mean.
9.       Unfortunately, weighting by import values has the disadvantage of
underestimating  the restrictiveness  of the regime.   In fact,  the more
restrictive the measures, the fewer imports there will be, so that the
weighting factors of the hardest hit items decrease.   In the extreme case
in which all permit applications  are denied,  no imports  enter  through
controlled items, and the weighting factors of these items will be zero.
Consequently there will be an appearance of complete freeing when a very
restrictive system will actually be in place.
co     Weighted Average based on Domestic Production
10.    To avoid this bias, it is normal practice to use weighting systems
that reflect the relative importance of goods in domestic production.

Instead of asking what is the percentage of imports channeled through items
subject  to permits  or  other  non-tariff  barriers  (NWU),  the  question
becomes:    What  percentage  of domestic  production  is subject  to NTBs.
Likewise, tariffs can be averaged on the basis of domestic production.
11.    It is necessary to mention some disadvantages of weighting based on
domestic production.   The first is of a practical nature and consists of
the statistical work necessary to establish a correspondence between
domestically produced goods on the one hand and tariff items on the other.
12.     Another disadvantage resides in the fact that,  from the point of
view of national accounting, the concept of production has more than one
meaning.   The intermediate inputs elaborated in a factory and then incor-
porated into subsequent production within the same factory are normally not
considered  part  of output  at the national  level.   Thus  output at the
national level depends on the statistical unit of input.   It can happen,
for instance, that the primary smelting of iron or steel appears indepen-
dently in the production accounts, or it can be eliminated as a direct
input in secondary smelting.
13.    Perhaps a greater disadvantage lies in the fact that much of domes-
tic output does not compete directly or indirectly with imports, so that
the regime remains without effect for such goods.   For example, the fact
that crude oil imports are subject to NTBs is a largely institutional
matter and may have little or no protectionist effect. Nevertheless, crude
oil represents 14% of Mexico's tradeable output, for which reason the
percentage subject to permits is commensurately raised by 14 points.
14.    However, other export commodities exist for which a permit or import
tariff is not totally superfluous.   Take,  for example,  coffee and beer,
which are export commodities whose importation is subject to the prior
import requirement.   If imports of these were allowed, other varieties of
coffee and other brands of beer would surely be imported, even though
domestic  equivalents  are  perfectly  competitive  on  foreign  markets.
Therefore, it is not easy to determine for what commodities the NTB regime
is operative and to what extent.
d.     Weighted Average based on YFifl Demud
15.      To avoid  the disadvantages deriving  from  the ambiguity  of the
concept of output in national accounting, weighting factors of tinal demand
can be used in place of those of domestic output.   However,  it must be
pointed out that information seldom exists on the final demand per product
at the required  level of detail.   An approximation can be achieved by
assigning a fixed economic destination (intermediate or final) to each
product of domestic output. But many commodities--the most important among
them-are destined to both intermediate and final demand (sugar, gasoline,
textiles, etc.).

e.     WeLghted Average based on Domestic Deomd
16.    To mitigate the bias introduced by the fact that the NTB regime has
little if any impact on the protection of exported or nontraded good., the
weighting factors can be measured in terms of internal demand, i.e., domes-
tic output plus imports minus exports.   This approach would entail some
statistical classification and appraisal difficulties, though these do not
seem insurmountable, but the approach in any event would not be totally
correct for biases.
3.     Estimation of Domestic Output Weighting Factors
17.      The methodology here chosen involves weighting  factors based on
domestic output for approximately 2,500 products encompassing more chan 902
of Mexico's traded goods production.  The manner in which these weighting
factors have been estimated is explained in the methodological appendix.
18.    When these weighting factors are applied to the NTB regime in effect
on March 31, 1986, the result is that 55.02% of domestic output was subject
to prior permits (QRs) and 17.5% to official reference prices (ORPs). The
net MTM coverage (excluding double-counting of items subject to both
Permits and ORPs) is 67.5%.   Siuilarly,  one finds a production-weighted
average tariff rate of 22.7Z, with a standard deviation of 25.6%.
19.    The results, broken down by branch and subbranch, are presented in
the  statistical  appendix  (Annex VIII).   The  tables  in the  statistical
appendix show which sectors are affected by the various types of NTBs and
in which part of their domestic output that impact occurs.  More than half
of QR coverage, for example, is traceable to petroleum and natural gas
(15.9%); agricultura (7.4%); oil refining (4.6%); apparel (2.5%); and the
assembled auto industry (1.9X).  Similarly, the heaviest incidence of ORPs
is found in soft textiles (2.22); the assembled auto industry (1.9%); the
basic iron and steel industry (1.8%); paper and coal (1.2%); and the beer
industry (L.1Z).
20.      The set of domestic output weighting factors makes possible the
immediate estimation of changes in the sectoral incidence of new or reduced
NTBs, as well as the weighted sectoral tariff structure and its spread.

MEXICO
METHODOLOGICAL APPENDIX
ESTIMATION OF DOMESTIC-OUTPUT WEIGUTINC FACTORS
1.     Level of Atgregation
21.     The weighting factors were estimated for three levels of aggrega-
tion: (i) branch level (59 branches that produce tradeable goods); (ii)
subbranch  level (157 branches);  and (iii) product  level.   The weighting
factors of the branches and subbranches were calculated based on the value
of output at current prices, reported in the National Accounts of 1983.
2.     Sources of Information
22.     The principal source of information used to estimate the weighting
factors of commodities in the subbranches was the list of Products Obtained
by Type of Activity of the Industrial Census of 1975.  To date there is no
more recent equally detailed information.   This list contains information
on the production value of 9,000 products approximately classified by value
in descending order according to 256 types of activity.
23.    Other sources of information used in the estimates were:  (1) Annual
Industrial Survey of 1983; (ii) Statistical Yearbook of Domestic Agricul-
tural Output of 1981; (iii) Report of Petroleos Mexicanos (PENEX) Activi-
ties for 1984; and (iv) the Input/Output Matrix for 1970.   These sources
were used to estimate weighting factors of the products of branches 1 to 4,
33, 34, and some special subbranches.   For example, in the assembled auto
industry, where a structural change in favor of cars with fewer cylinders
has been carried out, the most recent report of the Industrial Survey,
1983, was used.
3.     Classification of Commodities in Accordance with Tariff Items
24.    As a first step, an attempt was made to determine, for each commod-
ity contained in the lists, the corresponding tariff position.  It should
be pointed out that this involves a classification of commodities towards
the tariff position, not of the tariff positions towards the commodities.
In other words, the commodity remains within the tariff position, but the
coverage of the position may be broader.
25.     It can happen, and in fact it has happened frequently, that dif-
ferent commodities are mapped in one single tariff item.  To avoid as much
as possible such repetitions, commodities that can be classified under dif-
ferent tariff items have been grouped in one single category when the repe-
titions are witlhn the subbranches.   Where repetitions occur within one
branch, but in different subbranches, the commodities involved have usually
been transferred to the subbranch of greatest output.

26.      The repetitions in different branches have not been eliminated.
Another difficulty that has often arisen is that the commodity, or the
description thereof, did not lend itself to classification as a single
item.  For dresses, for example, there are more than five possible items,
depending on whether they are of cotton, synthetic or artificial fibers,
wool, or another fiber.  In such cases, the weight of the weighting factor
was spread over the possible items in subjectLve fashion.  In many cases a
simple pro rating was the only solution.
27.     There were also cases in which an aggregation of tariff items was
applied.  Domestically-produced pigments, for instance, are classified as
75 items, almost all with a tariff rate of 40% and no permit requirement.
To prevent consequent repetition of the product, the items involved were
aggregated according to regime and subsection.
28.     Finally, it must be noted that for a number of products it proved
impossible to find the corresponding item.  Sometimes the reason for this
was that the description of the product was so unclear that its classifi-
cation was impossible; in other cases, too much tie would have been spent
searching.   This applied especially to products of little Importance in
domestic production, which were omitted if the deadline for finding the
item was not met.
29.    In this manner, a total of 2,388 commodities were classified, cover-
ing more than 90% of domestic production. Among them, there are 355 repe-
titions of items, so that, without repetitions, 2,033 tariff items are cov-
ered. However, among these 2,033 items, 8 are added items, which actually
represent 73 individual items, increasing the number of items relresented
to a total of 2,098. The annexes contain the list of items included in the
eight added items.
4.     Weighting Factors
30.    To calculate the ueighting factors of the pr-oducts included, first
their reported production values in the lists were recorded.  Ther these
production values were standardized in terms of the value of the weighting
factor of the corresponding subbranch.
31.    Of course, this procedure assumes that the structure of the included
products is representative of those aot incorporated, which is not entirely
justifiable.  However, it must be borne in mind that the included products
represent more than 90% of total output, so that any possible bias cannot
be very great.
32.     An alternative form sr3gested in order to take account of products
not included consists of:  (i) adding all non-included products for each
st bbranch; (ii) estimating its relative value in the output of the sub-
branch; and (iii) evenly spreading the resulting weighting faccor among all
the items belonging to the subbranch but not present among the items of the
included products.

33.    There are three reasons why much a procedure does not appear advis-
able. The first is that there is no cortainty that the non-included prod-
ucts should not also be classified in items already included; the second is
that no satisfactory classification of items by subbranches exists, and the
third is that, among non-included products, there are many belonging to the
so-called "secondary output," that is to say, products that would be
classified in other subbranches.
5.     Derived Indicators
34.    Four indicators of the protection provided by the import regime were
derived from the weighting factors calculated in the above manner:
a) The percentage of domestic output subject to prior permits;
b) The percentage of domestic output subject to official prices;
c) The average tariff; and
d) The tariff variance (-dispersion squared).
All these  indicators can be calculated by branch, by subbranch for any
aggregation of branches or subbranches, and for the tradeable production of
the whole economy.
35.     The first two indicators are obtained by accumulating the weighting
factors of the products controlled separately. The average tariff and the
tariff  variance  were  calculated  on  the  basis  of  output,  evaluated  at
domestic prices, while the averaging of the tariff rates should ideally be
done with weighting factors for foreign prices. To convert the evaluation
of the foreign price weighting factors, it would be necessary to have a
ratio between domestic and  foreign prices  for all commodities.   In the
absence of this type of information, one can consider the division between
(1 + t) as a Eirst approximation of this conversion.  It is easy to prove
that below this given, the proposed form is equivalent to a direct
averaging with weighting factors for foreign prices.
6.     Tariff Variance
36.      The tariff variance was also obtained with weighting factors at
approximate foreign prices. It should be noted that the total variance can
be broken down into two elements:   the weighted average of the variance
within the sectors and the intersectoral variance of the sectoral
averages. A similar breakdown can be applied at the branch and subbranch
level.
37.     Finally, it must be observed that tariff dispersion is defined as
the square root of the variance:
dispersion   -rvariance

VII. Exchange rate arrangement: Since August 5, 1985 two official markets
have been operative in Mexico:  a controlled market covering speci-

sactions  and a parallel market.   The controlled market  rate  is
determined under a managed float system guided by a set of indica-
tors, whereas the parallel market rate is established by market
forces.   The controlled market  rate undergoes  daily  unspecified
discreet adjustments.   Parties eligible to utilize the controlled
market (with the exception of office and agencies of the public
administration) can choose to complete any transaction at a "retail
rate" agreed between the parties and the financial institutions
authorized to operate in this market, or at the "equilibriu' ex-
change rate" of the day.  The daily "equilibrium exchange rate" is
determined each day at a fixing session at the central bank, where
representatives of the various financial institutions operating in
the market exchange bids for purchases and sales of foreign ex-
change; the central bank may also submit bids in these sessions.
For transactions exceeding US$50,000, the parties concerned may make
completion of the transaction contingent upon the equilibrium
exchange rate achieving a particular minimum or maximum value. As
of March 1986 the "controlled market equilibrium exchange rate" was
Mex$472.70 per U.S. dollar, and the spread between the exchange
rates in the controlled market and the parallel market was about
2.4X.

EVOLUTION AND REFORM OF TRADE POLICY
1.              Mexico's  postwar  trade  policy has  been geared toward import
substitution, particularly for the indurtrial sector.  In agriculture, domestic
supply has taken precedence over tra3e, and trade policy has been closely
intertwined with domestic price  controls and  marketing arrangements.   This
chapter describes the changes in Mbxico's trade policy from 1960 to the present,
and analyses the range of policies and instruments that affect industry and
other sectors.  This Annex provides an overview of policies directly affecting
imports and exports, such as tarif±s, import and export restrictions, and other
discretionary controls on trade.
A.    EVOLUTION OF MEXICO'S TRADE POLICY REGIMES
2.        Mexico entered the 1950s with a relatively open economy, characterized
by few quantitative restrictions on imports and low to moderate tariffs.
Prices, however. rose rapidly initiating an inflation-devaluation cycle which
resulted in an increase in the peso-dollar exchange rate from 4.85 in 1945 to
12.50 in September 1954, when it was fixed at a level that would prevail until
September 1976. Although the period under the fLxed exchange rate regime has
been characterized as one of "stabilizing development", rates of domestic
inflation, nevertheless, exceeded those of most of Mexico's major trading
partners, resulting in an appreciation of the real exchange rate.
3.          With the increasing overvaluation of the peso pressures emerged to
increase protection levels.   Tariffs were first raised in 1956 as part of a
general revision of the tariff classification system. The unification of customs
classifications in 1960 provided another opportunity for an increase in tariff
rates, and all tariffs were again increased in 1965. Average tariff protection
increased dramatically from 14.9Z in 1977 to 20.12 in 1978, and then rose
continuously, but at a slower rate, to around 27% in 1982. The dispersion of the
tariff structure (measures by the standard deviation of tariff rates) rose from
11.7% to 19.9%.  Both the average tariff rate and dispersion increased further
until 1982.
4.        While average tariff protection increased from 1965 to 1982, it cannot
fully account for the dramtic increase in effective protection (based on price
comparisons) during this period (see Table VIII.1). Nor can differences in tar-
1ff rates across industries fully explain observed differences in implicit
nominal protection.   Changes in the coverage of quota restrictions, price con-
trols, combined with movements in the exchange rate have been more important
determinants of nominal protection over time. The scope of import controls was
substantially enlarged during the 1960s, with approximately 1000 import catego-
ries per year added to the control list (Table VIII.2).   Controlled imports
represented approximately 602-65Z of total imports throughout the second half of
the decade (See Figure 15 of main text).
5.          In the early 1970u a moderate decline in the percentage of imports
under quota occurred, due to an increased import share of raw materials and
fuels that were not subject to controls. Between 1972 and 1976, however, the

coverage of imports by the quota system increased sharply, from 56% to 94%, as
the peso became increasingly overvalued.   The peso devaluation of 1976 was
accompanied by a rollback of the coverage of the quota regime to the levels
which had prevailed  in the  late 1960s.   The Lopez-Portillo administration,
moreovert committed itself to further reductions in the quota regime which were
carried out between 1977 and 1980. Tariffs were increased on liberalized items
to assist producers to adjust to the removal oi the quantitative restrictions.
Import categories subject to liberalization were primarily in intermediate and
capital goods.  Coverage of final consumer goods and consumer durables remained
largely unchanged, although by 1980 the Ministry of Trade (Comercio) Lad
developed plans for a substantial deepening of the liberalization process.
6.         By 1980, however, expansionary monetary and fiscal policies had begun
to spill over into substantial domestic inflation. Devaluation of the peso was
avoided through increases in oil revenues and foreign borrowing, and as a
result, the real exchange *--e appreciated markedly.  The Government responded
in the area of commercial policy by abandoning the liberalization program for
the second half of the presidential term (sexenio), and by turning progressively
back  toward  the reimposition of quantitative  import controls.   The process
gained momentum in 1981, when tariffs were also increased, and by the time of
the 1982 crisis import controls had been extended to cover 100% of tariff
categories and all of total imports.
Trade Policy and Effective Protection 1960-1982
7.          Table VIII.1 shows the level of effective protection in five broad
industry groups for 1960, 1970, and 1980. In general the structure of effective
protection changed  little in more  than twenty years.   Mexico exhibited  the
pattern of "cascading" effective rates of protection, from very high levels on
final goods to low or negative levels on primary commodities, normally
associated with import substitution regimes, vith the exception that final,
non-durable consumer goods received substantially lower levels of protection
than consumer durable and capital goods.
8.         Effective protection to the primary goods sectors of the economy was
low. In mining it has remained consistently negative, while in agriculture the
price supports introduced under the Sistema Alimenticio Mexicano (SAM) during
the Lopez Portillo administration reversed the trend toward negative effective
protection in agriculture by 1980. Effective protection to non-durable consumer
goods rose slightly between 1960 and 1970 and then declined to its lowest level
in twenty years by 1980. To a large extent this decline reflected very low (and
sometimes negative) levels of effective protection to basic consumer goods, such
as  food  products and  beverages which were available at   subsidized  prices
through the CONASUPO system. However, in a number of important consumer goods
industries such as clothing, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, effective protection
increased and remained high relative to other consumer goods industries and to
levels of effective protection in general.   Of particular note was the rapid
rise in effective protection to the clothing industry which was heavily
protected by quantitative restrictions on imports.
9.              Intermediate goods  industries experienced a continuous overall
increase in levels of effective protection during the period 1960-1980. For the
most part this reflected a shift in the composition of output toward relatively

more highly protected industries, rather than an increase in levels of effective
protection at the industry level.   Basic chemicals,  rubber products, and non-
metallic minerals were among the activities with the greatest increases in
effective protection rates.   Fertilizers are an interesting case of a reversal
in levels of effective protection, from extremely high in 1970 to negative in
1980.
10.         Durable consumer and capital goods registered the highest overall
effective protection, as well as persistent growth in levels of protection
during the entire period.  Particularly notable increases in levels of protec-
tion occurred in machinery, electrical and electronic machinery and apparatus,
transport equipment and automobiles and parts. In automobile production protec-
tion declined between 1960 and 1970 and then sharply increased during the period
1970-1980.
11.         The overall level and dispersion of effective protection increased
steeply from 1979 to 1981, primarily because of the rapid expansion of the quota
regime (Table VIII.3).  Internal inflation increased more rapidly than external
inflation, with widely differing impacts on implicit nominal protection depend-
ing on the effects of import quotas.  The range of ERPs was the greatest among
import substitution industries, while exportables seem to have had a more
limited spread of protection.   Agriculture generally has negative protection.
The combination of strong price controls in agriculture and increased protection
for import substituting industries accounted for these widening differentials in
protection to various industries.
Export Controls
12.         In 1976, about 797 export positions (fracciones) out of 3,026 were
subject to export controls.  The rationale for quantitative control of exports
was primarily to enforce domestic production and marketing controls.   Export
supply was viewed as the residual of domestic production in excess of
consumption. This general motivation was evident in the types of goods covered
by controls--important basic food items, such as meat and milk, products
regulated by parastatals like sugar and coffee and products with sanitation
regulations, for example seafoods.   By 1980, controls had been reduced to 578
positions, comprising 60% of total exports (about 85% of nonoil exports). Goods
conLsidered as internal market priorities are the major group remaining under
export controls (Table VIII.28).
13.         Export controls, while ensuring that supply of the domestic market
took priority, discouraged production by depressing domestic prices below FOB
equivalents. This effect was reinforced by regulation of price changes and/or
administered pricing which created additional divergences between international
and domestic relative prices. As the regulated pricing system became increas-
ingly misaligned with international relative prices, levels of negative effec-
tive protection increased in primary goods production and the requirement for
strict control of exports increased.
s. INITIAL EFFORTS AT WEFORN: 1983-85
14.        The de Is Madrid Administration took office in late 1982 with two
primary economic policy objectives: first, to stabilize the economy and provide
a viable short- to medium-tern strategy for recovery from the external and

internal crises of 1982; and second, to promote longer term structural change in
the Mexican economy with the objective of making it more internationally
competitive  and  less  dependent  on  petroleum  exports.    Both  the  National
Development Plan of 1983 and the sectoral Plan for Industry and Foreign Trade of
1984 emphasized the need to increase the efficiency of Mexican industry through
greater exposure to international competition.
15.      The exigencies of the stabilization program and the perceived political
difficulty  of  initiating  meaningful  trade  liberalization  resulted  in  very
limited action on commercial policy  in 1983.   Coverage  of the quota regime
remained  at 100%  of  total  imports.   The Ministry  of Commerce and Industry
initiated a program to rationalize the tariff structure in order to achieve a
greater uniformity of effective rates of protection based on tariffs alone.
Early implementation efforts, however, primarily involved "ecreasing nominal
tariff rates on a number of intermediate s'd capital goods on which quantitative
restrictions had been reimposed in 1982.
16.      in 1984, the Government moved quite slowly in its reform of commercial
policy and by end 1984, only 17% of total imports had been freed from quanti-
tative controls.   Tariff adjustments continued primarily to consist of donward
adjustments in categories subject to quantitative restrictions.   In early 1985
the Government announced its intention to reduce the coverage of the quota
regime to between 55% and 65% of total imports by the end of the year.   The
Ministry of Commerce and Industry also proposed to alter the structure of tariff
protection to provide transitional support to activities in the sectors to be
liberalized.  Some limited removal of licenses and restructuring of the tariff
schedule was accomplished in the first half of 1985, against substantial opposi-
tion in many segments of the bureaucracy and the private sector, and by end-June
the coverage of import restrictions had been reduced to 75.5% of total imports
(1984 weights). Average tariff rates, weighted by imports, for both controlled
and freed imports were approximately equal at 8.6% and 8.9% respectively.
17.        By 1985, export controls were reduced to about 265 tariff positions,
and about 14.8% of total exports (44.1% of non-oil exports).  The structure did
not substantially change.   Agriculture still accounted for the major share of
the controlled nonoil exports, about 37.8%.   In the manufacturing sector,  the
introduction of voluntary export restraints on steel and steel products led to
the imposition of export controls on these items, but no other major changes
were apparent.   Prior to 1983,  the procedure for applying for permission to
export was quite extensive and tedious; by 1985, this procedure has been
substantially simplified and shortened.
Movements in Nominal Implicit Protection
18.      The magnitude of the 1982 devaluation, coupled with some stickiness in
domestic prices, resulted in widespread negative nominal implicit protection to
import substitution activities throughout 1983.   Internal price controls were
present for about 52.2% of domestic production (1983 values) and significantly
affected nominal protection.  A high incidence of price controls are found in
agriculture and agro-based products, petroleum and deriv. cives, fertilizers,

pharmaceuticals, soaps, domestic appliances, and automobiles.  However, except
for a few agricultural commodities, the negative nominal rates were not sus-
tamned in later years as domestic inflation rose faster than international
inflation.
19.       Agricultural support prices in peso,terms were well below their border
price equivalents, resulting in negative protection of most agricultural commod-
ities, which was not reversed until early 1985.  The negative nominal implicit
protection to agriculture was supported by export restrLetions which prevented
export sales of agrlcultural commodities at international prices. Similar pat-
terns of colnciding negative nominal protection and price controls were also
observed in basic consumer goods and some intermediates.   Some of the nonagri-
cultural products with negative protection and extensive price controls are
paper and cardboard, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, petroleum and its deriva-
Lives, fertilizer, glass, and basic metals. Home electrical appliances and auto-
mobiles are two sectors where, despite price controls, nominal protection is
still substantially positive.
20.       Positive implicit protection prevailed for some intermediate products,
metal products, and consumer durables, which had very high protection prior to
1982.   Among these heavily protected industries are rubber products, resins,
plastics, machinery and equipment, and household appliances and automobiles.
Thus, although by 1982 quota coverage was comprehensive, the protective effect
of the quota regime was primarily felt in manufactures of heavy intermediate and
consumer durables, sectors in which high rates of protection had prevailed
throughout the post-war period.   Most manufacturing activities benefited from
positive and rising protection due to the quota system. By early 1985, negative
implicit nominal protection prevailed mostly for agriculture, agro-industry, and
oil and oil products, while positive implicit protection was observed for miner-
al products and the major part (about 67Z of production activ ties) of non-food
manufacturing industries. Furthermore, among the manufactured products that had
negative protection were fe-tilizers, pharmaceuticals, and printing, products
that were heavily subjected to price controls.
Movements in Effective Protection
21.       The movements in implicit protection between 1982 and 1985 are reflec-
ted in similar changes in effective protection.   In the period following the
1982 devaluation, levels of effective protection diminished due to the temporary
fall in domestic prices below their peso equivalent international prices. The
reintroduction of quantitative restrictions in 1982, coupled with differing
rates of internal relative price movements, caused an increase in the variance
of effective protection rates. Much of the negative effective protection asso-
ciated with the devaluation and stabilization period had begun to erode by late
1984, and prior to the July 1985 reduction in quantitative restrictions prelimi-
nary estimates show that effective protection rates were rising again to their
historical levels.
22.        Due to the limited change in commercial policy, the structure of ef-
fective protection in Mexico remained largely unchanged between 1982 and mid-
1985.  Primary products, especially agriculture and crude oil, basic consumer
products, and other agro-industrial products, received low or negative effective
protection, while mineral products and most of non-food manufactured products

received high effective protection.  The highest rates of effective protection
(greater than 50%) were found in capital goods, consumer durables, and import
competing intermediates (Table VIII.5).
C. THE JULY 1985 AND SUBSEQUENT REFORNS
23.         On July 25, 1985 the Government announced the elimination of quota
restrictions on 3604 tariff positions, representing approximately 37% of 1984
imports. This brought the percentage of total imports covered by licenses down
to 38.8%, the lowest level since 1960.  Tariff rates on liberalized Items were
adjusted upward to cushion the fall in relative prices, and the import weighted
average tariffs for controlled and liberalized items diverged substantially at
6.3% and 17.1%, respectively.
Changes in Quntitative Restrictions
24.        Table VIII.6 summarizes the extent of liberalization of quantitative
restrictions  carried out on individual industries.   All lntermediate  goods
industries were heavily liberalized, together with a few consumer goods
products, pharmaceuticals, and selected industrial capital goods. Quantitative
restrictions on consumer durables, notably household electrical appliances and
automobiles, remained unchanged. Limited liberalization was carried out in
agricultural commodities, processed food products, alcoholic beverages, apparel,
and leather products  (See Table VIII.6).   Among manufactured food products,
major changes occurred in animal foods and malt beverages, and minor ones in
nixtomal products and animal and vegetable oils.   Among nondurable consumer
goods, apparel, tobacco, and, to a lesser extent, soap, are still heavily
restricted.   Most capital goods were only partially released from (Rs, with
heavier liberalization in electronic equipment, structural shapes, and metal
furniture-
Changes In the Tariff Structure
25.          Tariff adjustments made following the July reform have somewhat
increased levels of nominal tarlff protection.   Between 1982 and June 1985,
average tariff protection declined from 27% to about 21.7%, and the standard
deviation  from 24.8% to 18.6%.   The July, 1985 reform then increased this
average to about 25.3Z, although the level of dispersion was virtually
unchanged.  The number of tariff rates decreased from 20 rates in 1978 to 10 at
present.
26.       Tariffs were increased to replace QRs in all cases where the QRs were
binding (when nominal implicit protection exceeded tariff protection) and
increased slightly when implicit protection was positive but less than the
tariff.  Tariffs remained unchanged in most cases when the initial protection
was negative with the exception of forestry, basic chemicals, glass products,
animal foods and other manufacturing (see Table VIII.6).
27.         In cases where the QR was binding, it appears that nominal tariffs
were raised to provide the levels of the implicit protection prior to July,
1985. For example poultry, meat and mllk products, resins, plastics, nonelectri-
cal machinery, electrical machinery, and chemicals had implicit nominal protec-
tion rates under the quota regime (141, 30Z, 23%, 431, 181, 48%, and 29%,

respectively) whlch exceeded the level of tariff protection. In each case, upon
removal of import controls, tariff rates were raised to equal approximately the
levels of implicit protection.
Official Reference Prices
28.           Following the July 25 reductions of quantitative restrictions,
official reference prices were extended from 4.4% to 7.6% of total 1984 imports,
and from 749 to 1,215 tariff positions.  By April 1986, this coverage decreased
to 7% of  1984 imports, and to 1,177 tariff positions.   As of March  1986
reference prices covered 17.5Z of production, 12.5% of which are on prodLcts
with no quantitative restrictions. While official reference prices were origin-
ally used for exchange control and antidumping purposes, there is some evidence
to indicate that they are now used for protectionist purposes. For example, in
the second half of 1985, official prices were adjusted or imposed only for items
that had been freed from import controls.  Preliminary estimates from a sample
of 1189 products with official prices show that, on average, Implicit protection
for commodities under reference prices is 36.8% higher than the nominal protec-
tion permitted by the tariff rates alone.   Within the sample, the effect on
implicit protection of reference prices is widely dispersed (Table VIII.19).
Nominal and Effective Protection
29.       Preliminary estimates of implicit nominal protection since July, 1985
show a reversal in its rising trend. The average fell to -11.O in July, -20.3%
in August, and declined further to -22.4% in December 1985.  The peso devalua-
tion of about 70% during this period, coupled with the remaining price and quota
controls, largely explains the fall in overall implicit protection.  Since the
majority of Mexico's productive sectors continue to be regulated by quotas and/
or domestic price controls, It is not surprising that overall implicit protec-
tion declined. The decline, however, is transitional and will be eroded in the
same fashion as that experienced between 1982 and 1984.
30.        One of the more dramatic changes in early 1986 was the relaxation of
price controls on tortillas and corn products, and the release of a plan to do
the same for bread, wheat products, and other basic foodstuffs. Domestic price
controls have been mainly responsible for negative protection for these
industries.
31.          Effective protection rates also declined after July 1985 (Table
VIII.8).  Overall, average effective protection dropped from -6.0Z in January-
June to -102 in July, and to -19.1% in August 1985. The average EPR appears to
have remained at about -20% until the end of 1985. The degree to which effective
protection rates declined differed among commodities, and some commodities
Lctually had increased protection.   Agriculture and other products with price
controls had negative effective protection. Capital goods, a few intermediates,
and consumer durables retained their positive effective protection.  Thus, high
protection basically remained for most of nonfood manufactures, especially for
consumer durables.
32.           The extensive liberalization of import permits in mid-1985 was
strongly biased against intermediate goods and toward consumer durables and
capital goods (Table VIII.22).  There is some indication that while effective

protection declined for almost all items after the July devaluation, it declined
more for intermediate goods than for capital goods, consumer durables, and some
agro-based products that remained controlled by import licenses (Table VIII.-
22).   Relatively small decreases In EPRs were observed for wheat and agricul-
tural products, primarily because of changes made to domestic prices by the
government. Protection of consumer durables such as automobiles and domestlc
appliances and some capital goods also seems not to have declined substantial-
ly. Large decreases were observed for some intermediate products, such as
resins, basic chemicals, basic metals and metal products, and consumer noadura-
bles like meat and milk products. Interesting cases of increased protection,
despite the devaluation, were found in coffee processing, animal fats, cement,
and plastics (whose EPR fell in mid-1985 but recovered in December). Protection
remained unchanged for nonferrous metals and clay and stone. The trend seems to
show a greater reduction of protection for Intermediates, than for agriculture
'nd consumer durables.
33.       The dispersion of effective protection decreased between 1982 and mid-
1985, and increased substantially, because of the dcvaluation, in the second
half of 1985. While dispersion of nominal protection has reversed to predevalu-
ation levels, the dispersion of effective protection has not which implies that
the liberalization may partially account for an increased disparity in incen-
tives in favor of some capital goods, consumer durables, and automobiles.   A
large part of the disparity in incentives seems to be accounted for by the pre-
sence of some goods whose domestic price controls lead to highly negative
protection. The more prominent of these goods are corn, wheat anid bread, torti-
llas, sugar, animal feeds, beverages, fertilizers and pharmaceuticals. If these
goods are excluded total dispersion decreases dramatically (and average effec-
tive protection rises as well).   Goods with historically very high protection
such as meat and milk, synthetic fibers, other chemicals, plastics, electric
appliances, and automobiles also seem to have wide fluctuations in their effec-
tive protection rates from one period to another, primarily due to differential
movements and domestic on international prices.
D.  THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE TRADE POLICY REGIME
34.       Since July 1985 chere has been a continuous process of gradual libera-
lization of the trade policy regime.  This section summarizes the Vnesent status
of tariff and non-tariff restrictions on trade in Mexico.
Quantitative Restrictions and Other Non-7briff Barriers
35.        There are still 816 tariff positions under quantitative restrictions,
accounting for 38.5% of the value of 1984 imports (in comparison to 83% before
the July, 1985 reforms) (Table VIII.2).   An estimated 55% of 1983 production
(43.4% of nonoil production) and 50 of final demand are protected by import
licenses (Table VIII.13). Of the 38.5% of total imports remaining under quanti-
tative restrictions, 20.4% of total imports is accounted for by agriculture and
forestry and 7.4Z by capital goods and automobiles. The majority of controlled
tariff positions require import licenses (permiso previo), while imports for 311
tariff positions are automatically banned (negativa automatica).

TRADE POLICY                                                           ftPge 9 of 15
36.         Coverage of the quota regime is neither uniform across sectors nor
among types of goods.   Figure VIII.14 illustrates the coverage of value added
among sectors and by types of manufactured goods.  Oil and agriculture have the
highest incidence  of  production  coverage  of  import  quotas.   Manufacturing,
although less heavily protected, continues to have 441 of total value added
protected by import controls.   Within the manufacturing sector the changes in
July, 1985 reduced the production coverage of import permits more for Intermedi-
ate and capital goods than for consumer goods. Approximately 70% of the produc-
tion of consumer goods and 981 of the production of consumer durables remain
under import control.   As Figure VIII.4 illustrates, the production coverage
dimlnishes substantially for capital goods, light and heavy intermediates.
37.       The disparities between production coverage and import coverage of the
quota regime are apparent from Table VIII.14.   In manufacturing quantitative
restrictions account for a substantially larger share of production than imports
for consumer goods, consumer durables and capital goods.  In these sectors the
quantitative restrictions are nearly prohibitive of imports.   In intermediate
goods, on the other hand, import and production weights coincide more closely,
as a result of less restrictive controls on competing imports.
38.         A comprehensive estimate of the coverage of non-tariff barriers to
imports in Mexico can be obtained by combining the estimates of coverage of
import quotas and official reference prices.   Official reference prices cur-
rently are imposed on product groups accounting for approximately 17.3% of
production. of these product groups 5.0% of production is also covered by quan-
titative import restrictions, while 12.3Z is subject to reference prices alone.
Since about 55% of production is covered by quota restrictions, about 67.8% of
total productioi. is subject to non-tariff barriers to trade.
Nominal Tariff Rates
39.      The reforms in July replaced quantitatlve restrlctions with tariffs as
the major instrument for protection, primarily to increase the transparency of
the protection structure.   Thus, together with the reductions in quantitative
restritions, the government undertook a series of adjustments in the tariff
rates.  The average tariff rate weighted by 1984 import values increased from
8.6% in early 1985 to 12.4%.  Products which have been freed from QRs have an
import weighted average of 17.4% (compared to 9.41 prior to July, lA85), while
those still under QRs have an average of 4.5% (compared to the pre-July average
of 7.85). Production weighted average tariffs also increased from 18% in early
1985 to 22% in late October.  The standard deviation of tariff rates decreased
from 22.5% in early 1985 to  18.91.   Prior to the replacement of QRs with
tariffs, 50% of the tariff rates were between 0 and 15%; now, they fall within 0
to 25%. The number of tariff positions with rates above 75% also fell.
40.        Among the various sectors, manufacturing has a higher average tariff
than agriculture or minerals. Finished consumer goods also have higher tariffs
than intermediate or capital goods.   Tariff rates of around 101 dominate for
capital and intermediate goods not produced or only partially produced in
Mexico, between 25% and 40% for all other industrial products, and from 50 to
100% for "unnecessary" consumer goods.  Across industries, malt and alcoholic

beverages, selected textiles, garments, leather and shoes, cosmetics, glass
products, electronic equipment, automobiles, and miscellaneous have tariff
averages greater than 50%.
Export Mazes and Controls
41.          As of July 31, 1985, export controls were imposed on 265 export
classes (fracciones), accounting for 14.4% of total exports and 44% of non-oil
exports, while export taxes, or a combination of taxes and controls, were
imposed on 171 export classes.  In October, 1985, 15 fracciones were freed from
the controlled list, but these were minor exports and the removal did not signi-
ficantly change the export coverage of the restrictions. The administering
institutions for export taxes are SECOFI, the Ministry of Fisheries, and the
various parastatals which canalize the exports of their respective products.
42.         The bulk of the QRs on exports apply to three broad categories: (1)
ccmmodities for which Mexico has to abide by international quota agreements,
such as coffee, tobacco, cotton, and some minerals.  These products account for
about 4.8% of all exports; (2) products such as processed food, seafood,
pharmaceuticals, iron and steel products, and petroleum derivatives, where
export controls have been introduced either for reasons of quality and price
controls, and/or because of the voluntary export restraint agreement with the
United States. These products represent about 5.2% of Mexico's exports; and (3)
agricultural products in which Mexico's domestic production is considered
deficient (staples such as corn, soybeans, sorghum, and flour), for which
domestic prices are well below world market prices and where there are monopoly
marketing and distribution channels (e.g. CONASUPO and/or some other parastatal
enterprises). This category accounts for 3.4% of total exports.
43.         Export controls are, therefore, linked with the presence of pricing,
marketing, and bilateral trade policies, and liberalization of such controls
would entail changes in these  complementary policies.   In agriculture, for
example, liberalization would depend on the reform of domestic pricing policies
and distribution channels. Among manufactures, public sector efforts at quality
control would have to be replaced by private initiative and international
agreements would have to change to eliminate fully export restrictions.
Sector Program. (Programas de Ram)
44.         One of the key omissions of the current trade policy reform is the
continued use of trade restricting measures in industrial sector promotion
programs.  Sector programs for industrial promotion with built-in protectionist
measures, such as domestic content requirements and quantitative restrictions on
competing imports, have historically been used in Mexico.   One of the major
features of the existing industrial programs (programas de rama) is an incentive
and regulatory package designed to encourage increased use of inputs produced
domestically, while simultaneously increasing production and exports.  The set
of incentives used 'oy these programs include fiscal incentives, import permits,
and credit preferences.   So far, automobiles  (implemented in August, 1984),
pharmaceuticals  (February,  1984),  and  capital  goods  (September,  1981) have
industrial programs.  A program for electronic products has been designed, but
it is still not approved.

45.        Under the automotive sector program, firms producing automobiles will
purchase 50% of the value of their parts from the local autoparts industry
starting in 1986. Also, the autoparts industry has a domestic content require-
ment of 50 to 60%.  By 1987, cars will have domestic content of 60%, buses 70%,
heavy transport  80%, and construction transport  90%.   The domestic content
requirement (whose minimum is 33%) diminishes, however, the larger the percen-
tage of the output sold in the external market.  Final output of the sector is
protected by quantitative restrictions on competing imports.   Domestic content
requirements are also imposed on capital goods (about 50%) and pharmaceuticals.
Importation of competing pharmaceutical products is prohibited under the terms
of the program.  The still pending industrial program for electronics includes
domestic content requirements (of 55% for microcomputers and 45% for mini-
computers) within three years of the implementation of the program. Other
electronic equipment or supplies must have a 35-70% domestic content (depending
on the type of product) at the end of the same three year period. The program
also gives lmport permits only for inputs not produced domestically and
guarantees a procurement policy of the government that is biased toward
domestically produced electronic products.
46.         Recent discussions with the authorities charged with development of
the sectoral programs indicate, however, that future sectoral programs will be
designed around  the  use  of  more  transparent  promotional  instruments.    At
present, the other sectoral programs under development are being designed to use
tariff  protection  of  domestic  production  as  the  principal  promotional
instrument, and there is some indication that existing programs may be revised
to increase the transparency of protection.
Rule Eight (Regla Octava)
47.         Producers covered by the industrial promotion programs of tte Trade
and Industry Ministry may avail themselves of thre benefits pruvided by Rule
Eight. These priority industries are granted the right to import their inputs
at a tarifff rate of 5%.  The impact of rule eight is to increase effective
protection for industries producing for the domestic market. For industries
under the industrial programs, the rule offsets part of the firms' losses from
conforming with the domestic content requirement.   The net effect on effective
protection to the affected firms and products is not measurable with existing
data.
The Proposed Foreign Trade law
48.         The proposed Foreign Trade Law, which was submitted to Congress in
November, will provide the first comprehensive legislative framework for trade
policy instruments and policies that are currently in use by the Executive
branch of the Government and for various individual laws that deal with aspects
of trade  policy.   It will also  provide a legal framework for anti-dumping
measures and countervailing duties that will, upon implementation, replace
official reference prices.

49.        The impact of the proposed law will depend on its actual administra-
tion and implementation, particularly because of its generality, and the few
limits it sets on the use of trade policy measures by the executive body.  In
particular, implementing instruments will need to distinguish between injury to
domestic producers caused by competitive international prices and unfair trade
practices, an area in which the legislation itself is unclear.
E. THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM OF TRADE POLICY REFORM
50.         The discussion above shows that despite substantial reform of the
trade policy regime, Mexico continues to rely to a considerble degree on
discretionary policies to restrict imports and exports; quantitative restric-
tions on imports and exports cover a substantial part of production. Official
reference  prices  are  also  used  as  another  instrument  to  reduce  import
competition.   Tariffs, thus, still are not firmly established as the primary
instrument  for  trade  regulation.    Furthermore,  protection  is  liuked with
domestic price control policies and  selective industrial programs that impose
domestic content requirements in exchange for some fiscal incentives and import
permitB.
51.        The impact of this trade regime on the system of incentives is a lack
of transparency and a bimodal distribution of protection. Negative nominal and
effective protection prevails for agricultural products, while highly positive
protection is given to some consumer and capital goods and to consumer
durables.  The dispersion and levels of effective protection rose from 1979 to
1982  as  effective  protection  increased  for  selected  import  substituting
industries.  Since then, effective protection levels have fallen because of the
overall effect of the series of devaluations coupled with quantity and price
controls on tradeable goods. However, because of the different impacts of deval-
uation on implicit nominal prutection of various industries, disparities in
effective protection did not decline as much, and the high variance in effective
protective rates, characteristic of the trade policy regime, was preserved. The
following section provides a set of guidelines for policy reforms that are
directed toward increasing the transparency in the incentive system and toward
reducing the level and dispersion of protection across various industries.
Elimination of Semaining Qmutitative Restrictions of Imports
52.       Further trade policy reform, as described in the main text and in the
Statements of Trade Policy (Annex IV), will endeavor to eliminate in a phased
way the remaining quantitative restrictions on imports. The thirty year history
of quantitative restrictions as the major instrument of trade policy in Mexico
suggests that further reform of the quota system may encounter substantial
resistance from affected sectors. About 56.4% of total imports (1983 values)
have continuously been subjected to QRs, since the 1960s. A look at the tariff
positions that have been subjected to QRs for an extended time period shows
that, across product groups, agriculture accounts for the highest percentage of
imports (1983 values) that have been historically subjected to QRs, about
19.2%. The other categories with high historical levels of quota protection are
petrochemicals, chemicals, sugar, non-electric and electric machinery and
equipment, and transport equipment.

53.         The current coverage of quantitative restrictions is much less than
the coverage of long-standing protected industries given above.  The critical
sectors resain the same however, notably agriculture, petrochemicals and other
petroleum derivatives, capital goods, and consumer durables.   (Tables VIII.13
and VIII.15 show the existing shares of these sectors in the total percentage of
production and imports still under Import controls.)
Reductlon In the Dispersion of Nomimal and Effective Protection
54.        As quantitative restrictions are replaced by equivalent tariffs, the
simplest way to reduce the dispersion of effective protection Is to reduce the
dispersion of the nominal tariffs, as the Government has decided to do.   The
Government intends to limit the range of tariffs to within narrower limits,
i.e., both maximum and minimum tariff limits ¶aave been set for each stage of the
program.
55.       A policy simulation can be undertaken which shows the effect of intro-
ducing a lower dispersion of tariffs on the level and dispersion of nominal and
effective protection. In the table below the mean and standard deviation of the
tariff structure, based on 1983 weights, is estimated for the early 1986 tariff
range of 0-100Z, for a range of 0-502, and for four possible end-target ranges.
Two of these end targets have a minimum tariff of 1OZ, with maximum tariff rates
of 30% and 40%, while the others retain the present 0 duty categories of the
tariff structure.
Tariff Range             Mean       Standard Deviation
0-100                 22.0              22.14
0-50                  21.0              17.14
0-40                  18.0              15.56
0-30                  15.0              12.03
10-40                  23.0               8.75
10-30                  11.0               3.34
(Note: The means are weighted by 1983 production weights.)
56.       The range 10-30% leads to the lowest dispersion (as measured by stan-
dard deviation of the tarLffs across tariff positions) of 3.34% and mean of
11.0%. The range 10-40 has a higher dispersion of 8.75 and the highest average
tariff, but a substantially lower coefficient of variation than options main-
taining the minimum rate at 0%. The higher mean in the range 10-40% indicates
the relative importance (in total production) of the tariff positions with
tariffs of less than 10% compared to those with tariff rates greater than 40%.
57.       The impact of these scenarios on the structure of effective protection
cannot be readily established, given the extensive protection provided by the
quota system, and price controls. If, however, the absence of any binding quan-

titative restrictions and the erosion of any "water" in the tariffs due to price
controls is assumed, a simulated structure of effectlve protection based on
nominal tariffs alone can be constructed for each of the tariff ranges discussed
above.
Tariff Range    Mean EPR               Range            Standard
(Z)         (Simple)        Minimum    Maximum    Deviation
0-100           47.9         -4.5        216.5        40.9
0-50            39.9         -4.0        113.1        27.5
0-40            33.6         -3.2         92.8        20.9
0-30            25.6         -2.6         60.6        14.0
10-40            33.3          3.7         74.5        16.1
10-30            26.2          5.3         50.5        10.2
58.       The tariff range that has the lowest average effective protection rate
and standard deviation is 0-30%, which is the one chosen by the Government
(Annex IV), followed closely by the range 10-30%.  The dispersion changes only
slightly, from 14.0X to 16.1%, as one moves from the range 0-30Z to 10-40%, but
the average EPR changes from 25.61 to 33.3%. This is evident from Figure 2.5,
which shows a shift of a basically unchanged distribution to the right between
the two acenarios.  The increase in the average EPR reflects the importance of
the iteus whose nominal tariffs increased to 10%. Due to the structure of nomi-
nal protection, average EPRs and their dispersion decline as the upper limit Is
reduced from 100% to 30% while maintaining the lower limit at O. Moving from
the range 0-40% to 10-40Z hardly alters the average average EPR, but reduces
dispersion, which shows that there was an even distribution of increases to 10%
on inputs and outputs.
Reforu of Official Reference Prices and Sectoral Programs
59.        Official reference prices which have been set to monitor antidumping
practices will be phased out and replaced by a set of implementing rules of
Mexico's new Foreign Trade Law (see Annex IV and sain text). Of paramount impor-
tance to the successful implementation of these rules will be the need clearly
to distinguish between unfair trade practices and low international prices which
do not arise from dumping. The law provides for an injury test which should be
applied in all cases, and countervailing duties should be specific to the
product and country in question.
Reforming Export Controls
60.       Export controls have shown reduced coverage since the 1970's. At this
point, the majority of the existing export controls may be removed only if
changes are made to the domestic price controls and domestic marketing arrange-
ments (e.g. the use of parastatals as conduit between producers and buyers),
otherwise they have to coexist for the domestic controls to be feasible.   The
current liberalization of tortillas, and the potential one for bread and other

foodstuffs, are avenues for reform of export controls in wheat and corn products
and basic foodstuffs. Export controls in Industry as well are heavily linked to
domestic price controls, with the exception of fibers and steel where controls
are imposed to ensure compliance with quotas imposed by international
agreements.

this trend are s oll and nonsysteintic.  A slmple aproximatlon of the growth of labor productivity can W obtalned by dividing an Index
of rel gros domestic product (GOP) by an Index of the labor fore. For Mexico during the period fro 1971 to 1980, this ylelds an

Notes:  Mexican labor form  totals for 1940, 1950, and 1970 are from the ansus data on econoically activw  populatlon age 12 and aver
(Including unaqplored). The 1960 census figure ms adjusted to correct for avorcaunting of rural workers ifor details. see C. W.
Reynolds, "Labor Merkat Projectlons for the United States and Mexlco and Current Migration Controversies." Food Research
institute Studies 17, no. 2 (1979) Stanford mnlwrsity. 1,979)1. A detailed discussion of Meican labor forcm and upIcymnt
data Is In D. S. Keusing, *Eiploy.nt and Lack of Eploymnt In Mexico, 1900-1970)1 In J. W. Wiklke and K. Ruddle, Qumntitative
Latin America StudIe  (Los Angeles:  UCLA Lation Asrican Center, 1977):  his adjusted labor form  total for 1950 Is 8272 and for
1960 Is 9691. For 1940 and 1970 they ara the same as the consus figures. The estimates In row 2 are based an the nuuter of leal
tampoary workers (including Bracerca from 1942 to 1964) plus an estimat  of undocumanted workers during the previous 5-year
period (double the numbor of Illegals dported reduced by one-fourth for nonpartlelpants In the work forcm). The fIgure Is
reduced by 20 percant more In 1975 to pravide the mst conservatiw  possible estimat  In view ot the speculativ  nature of the
mthodology used. Row 3 Is based on the assumptlon that 10 perceant of the seaoonal migrants In row 2 elect to remain In the
United Status *ech year. Row 4 represents the next cumulatlwe legal migratIon of workers assuming that legal migrants from Mexico
have an 0.65 labor forme partllpatlon rate and a 5 percent attrition rate.
