REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE PHILIPPINES
FOR A FIaHERIES CREDIT PROJECT
I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of the Philippines for the equivalent of $11.6 million to
help finance a project for providing medium- and long-term credit for the
development of the fisheries sector. The loan would have a term of 17
years, including six years of grace, with interest at 7.25 percent per
annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.   A report entitled ICurrent Economic Position and Prospects of the
P:ilippines (78-PH dated April 20, 1973) was circulated to the Executive
Directors on   May  2, 1973.   Since the previous economic report in May 197.2,
the Philippines has suffered one of the worst floods of the century in the
Central Luzon area, President Marcos has imposed martial law, and a new
constitution, establishing a parliamentary system of government, has been
promulgated. The President has announced that martial law will continue
under the new constitution and that elections for a national assembly will
be postponed for six or seven years. The President is undertaking social
and economic reforms in the country and has announced that aside from law
and order, implementation of an agrarian reform program is a high priorit-y
in the Philippine development program for the immediate future. In addition
to decrees on agrarian reform, the President has promulgated decrees on tax
reform and on a number of bills which had been awaiting Congressional
approval, including the customs and tariff bill and the government reorgani-
zation bili.
3.   In the past three years the authorities have pursued policies of
monetary and fiscal restraint and have succeeded in improving substantially
the maturity structure of the external public debt. In spite of this, the
performance of the Philippine_economy hasg been somewhat disa ppinting, with
real GNP increasing by about 5 percent a year. Expansion in the economy
has been hampered by a combination of factors. First, a series of disruptions
to agricultural output since 1970 that was capped by the severe floods in July
1972, have seriously retarded the growth of food, and in particular rice
production. Second, there has been little improvement in export prices since
1970. At the same time, import prices have increased substantially, and the
result has been a 30 percent deterioration in the external terms of trade.
Because of this decline real gross national income per capita has been stationary
at about $200 since 1970. Third, the economy has experienced a period of rapid
inflation with consumer prices rising by more than 50 percent during the three
years 1970-72 due to the combined effects of devaluation, imported inflation
and shortfalls in domestic food production. These adverse trends have been
especially serious for the wage earning group. There has been a 20 percent
fall in real wages and a further rise in unemployment. However, in recent



- 2 -
months the rate of inflation has been reduced substantially and there has
been some recovery in the growth of real wages.
4.     The floods in July, which caused extensive damage, made the economic
situation in the Philippines more difficult.   Plublic infrastructure, in
particular, roads, flood control dikes, irrigation works and schools, were
damaged. Together with production losses and damage to private property,
the total cost of the flood damage was estimated at about $200 million.
Because of the extensive damage to the rice crop, the Philippines' rice
imports will be about 500,000 tons in FYI.973/74.  This will furthler strain
the balance of payments. In response to the flood disaster the Philippines
received about $76 million in assistance from foreign governments and
international agencies.
5.     The administrative, fiscal and monetary reforms that the Marcos
administration has begun to -implement under martial law could lead to
improved economic performance in the years ahead.   There can be little
question that the Philippines has the resources - both physical and
human - to achieve broadly based economic improvements, given the right
policies and adequate suipport for development within the country and from
outside.  The main elem.ents of the Government's development strategy
include:  (a) improvement of agriculture and other rural conditions;
(b) faster industrial and mineral development, including a large increase
in manufactured exports;   (c) an investment program that complements the
sector development programs by balancing the allocation of resources
between agriculture, industry and infrastructure; (d) financial manage-
ment to encourage exports, limit inflation and its aggravation of income
maldistribution, and furt;her improve the maturity pattern of the external
debt;  and (e) more adequate gover-nent revenue program and better public
sector managemen't.
6.     Capital formation in the Philippines is quite high, and the problem
will be to ensure that investrment outlays are more effective in future.
lThis would involve better use of industrial capacity than was achieved
during the sixties and sharply accelerated public development outlays if
bottlenecks in production are to be avoided and if the deterioration in
social services is to be reversed.  Public investment spending in FY 1972/73
is expected to be about I.5 billion pesos, compar-ed with 0.9 billion pesos
in the previous year.  Expenditures for rehabilitation, which are expected
to reach about 500 million pesos in FY 1972/73, account for a large portion
cf 1i increase.   During 1973-77 the total public investment program is
expected to be about 10 billion pesos.  Ou-tlays would rise from about 1.7
percent of GNP in 1968-72 to about 2.6 percent in 1973-77. About 4o
percent of the program would be for transportation, and 20 percent for power.
Irrigation would account for about 14 percent.
7.     Substantial additional taxation will be needed to finance the proposed
public investment program. Public savings during 1970-72 were about 2 percent
of GNP. A disappointing level of tax revenues was at the root of the problem.
The tax reforms introduced since martial law have resulted in a substantial
increase in revenue collections, wiith real revenues projected to grow by
about 8 percent this financial year, despi-te the real GNP growth rate of
only about 4 percent. A further rapid growth in revenues is expected



- 3 -
again in FY74   But if the Government is to undertake its ambitious develop-
ment program successfully, real revenues would have to expand by about 8 perce;it
a year during 1973-77, which in turn means that the Government's fiscal
effort will have to be intensified further.
8.      If both economic policy and sectora:L growth evolve as described,
incomes, employment and the balance of payments should ail improve. Even,
however, with rather optimistic assumptions about improvements within the
country and support from outside, the international payments position and
import capability will be tight. Merchandise exports are projected to grow
at about 8 percent a year during 1973-77, including a 3 percent increase
in prices.  Provided rice imports can be reduced after FY73/74 and imparts of
other consumer goods kept at about current levels, imports of raw materials.
intermediate goods and capital goods could be allowed to rise at about o-7
percent a year.  This may be sufficient to provide for a 6-8 percent growth
in GNP, without resulting in the balance of payments deteriorating.
9.      The foreign capital inflow to be met from transfers, direct invest-
ment and loan capital would need to be about $2,990 million, or about
$660 million a year, during 1973-77. Grants and private remittances wouLd
provide about $850 million and net direct investment about $60 m-_lion
during 1973-77.  Gross disbursements of medium- and long-term loan capi-tal
woul-d have to be about $2,090 million during 1973-77, or about $420 million
a year. Disbursements of commercial loans are estimated at about $1.1
billion during 1973-77.   The balance of disbursements during 1973-77 of
about $1 billion would have to come in the form of official development loans
from bil-ateral and multilateral sources.  During 1973-77 total disbursements
of project assistance could amount to about $550 million. The balance of
about $X40 mllion would be needed in the f'orm of quick disbursing commodity
assistance. There would be need for official commodity aid disbursements
of abou't $100 million a year over the next two years, at least, when the
capacity to absorb project assistance would still be quite limited. The
Philippines has received substantial amounts of commodity aid over the last
two years. The Consultative Group, which last met in June 1972, has
accepted that such aid will continue to be needed and has indicated amounts
which do not fall far short of these levels. Disbursements of commodity
assistance at these levels would help ensure a flow of raw materials that
should be sufficient for a smooth expansion of the economy, and that would
serve to avoid the potentially disruptive effects on output and employrment
that follow from raw material shortages ind'oced by a lack of foreign
exchange.
10.     Provided imports can, in fact, be contained as indicated above, and
provided the projected levels of official aid for commodity imports and
project assistance are forthcoming, management of the Philippines' external
debt and debt servicing, while difficult, would not present serious problems.
The level of external medium- and long-term debt would rise from $1.8 billion
at the end of 1972 to about $2.1 billion by 1977.   The level of debt service
would rise from about $410 miillion in 1973  to about $520 million in 1977,
while the debt service ratio on public and private debt would decline from
27 percent in 1973 to about 25 percent by 1977.   Even with the projected



official assistance program total service paymen-t would exceed the inflow of
medium- and long-term loan capital by about $250 million during 1973-77.
The heavy debt service will clearly be a handicap to the Philippine develop-
ment in this period and it will require continued close scrutiny over foreign
borrowing patterns to further improve the maturity structure of the debt.
11.     The Philippine development program will continue to require resources
in excess of expected local savings and of the foreign capital which will
become available for financing the import component of development projects.
Part of' these resources will be provided from commodity assistance. In
addition some financing of local currency expenditures will be justified
especially for projects of economic and social importance which need only
limited amounts of foreign exchange.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES
12.     The Philippines has received 17 Bank loans and two IDA credits
totalling $290 million, net of cancellations.    A little over half of the
Bank Group's lending,about $t150 million, has been for priority infrastructure
projects in power, transportation, water supply and education.    The remainder
has been divided about equally between agriculture and industry.   About
$75 million of this has been for irrigation, livestock, rice processing and
rural credit and about $65 million for industry in three loans to the
Private Development Corporation of the Philippines.
13.     Of total Bank/IDA lending for the Philippines of $290 million, two
loans and two credits totalling $52.2 million were made since the beginning of 1972
Disbursement on three of these havre Just begun while the fourth became
effective on April 11, 1973.    Of the remaining $238 million, the undisbursed
balance on March 31, 1973 was about $47.2 million, almost all of which was
accolnted for by five loans made since the beginning of 1969.   Disbursements
on three of these, all credit projects, are behind schedule due in part
to the general economic slowdown in the Philippines following the February
1970 devaluation and the subsequent stabilization program.    However,
disbursements on these loans began to pick up last year, although the
closing dates of two loans have recently been postponed.    Annex II gives
the status of Bank Group operations.
14.     Future Bank/IDA lending will continue to concentrate on public
infrastructure and agriculture.    The Bank Group will also continue to
help industry and provide more assistance for projects in the social sector.
The Government is giving top priority to rural development and land reform.
A recent Bank Agricultural Sector Study noted that expanding and improving
irrigation was essential to support land reform and to permit agricultural
production and rural incomes to increase.    The Upper Pampanga project,
at present under way, will make a vital contribution in the heavily tenanted
areas of Central Luzon.   Several additional irrigation projects are being
prepared, the first of which will probably be ready for approval in FY 1974.
The Government is formulating a rural development project and a number of
settlement projects within land reform areas which may be developed into
proposals suitable for Bank Group financing.    Further loans are also



likely to be made over the next two or three years for rural credit and
livestock.
15.     Bank/iDA infrastructure lending will continue to emphasize
transportation and power projects.  A second port project. was appraised
last December and is expected to be presented to the Executive Directors
for approval in early FY1974.  Further projects for highways, ports, ship-
ping and power are being prepared for Bank/IDA financing, In the social
sectors an IDA  credit was signed in Januariy 1973 for a oecond education
project and a proposed population project is being prepared.
16.     With an increased number of possible lending operations in sight,
I expect Bank Group lending to rise substantially above present levels
provided that the econoim  is managed reasonably well and that the Philippines
continules to improve its capacity to prepare and implement projects.
17.     IFC has made comnitments -in the Philippines totalling $64.5 million
for Investments in nine coTpanies in the fie:Ld of developmant banking,
power, telecommunications, ceramic tiles, paper, petroleum products, nickel
mining and refining, and chemicals. Of these investments, as of February 28,
1973, $17.8 million have been sold, $0.4 million cancelled and $1.1 million
repaid, leaving a net portfolio of $43 million. On the same date $17.8
million were undisbursed. Preliminary proposals have been received for an
aluminum smelter and other projects in the pulp and paper, dinnerware,
metal alloys and shipbuilding fields.
PART III - THE SECTOR
18.     Although the fisheries sector presently contributes only L percent
to GNP, it has considerable economic potential.   The arc hipelago with over
7,000 islands provides excellent access to fishing grounds and the
coastline with its many estuarine areas is ideal for brackish water fish
farming.   Fisheries employ directly about 700,000 persons (about 5.5
percent of total labor force) mainly in the traditional sector and fish
production is estimated to be about 1 million tons a year.    Further,
fish is a staple in the Filipino diet and provides about half of animal
protein intake - more than milk, eggs and meat combined.    Exports
consist of shrimp and tuna and amounted to $5.4 million in 1971 while
annual fish imports for human consumption, mainly canned mackeral from
Japan, stood at a value of about     $18 million.   Domestic demand for
marine products is growing rapidly and the Government proposes to give
additional emphasis to fisheries development over the next several years.
There is scope for productive investment in the commercial fishing fleet.
It contains about 2,200 vessels, mostly small.    However, the number of
larger and more specialized vessels (over 70 GT) has increased in recent
years to a level of about 500.    The fleet is mainly based in the Manila
area and around the Visayan Sea. In 1971 the commercial fleet caught
380,000 tons, representing only about 40 percent of the estimated potential.
Inland fisheries also offer promising avenues for development. The annual
production from fishponds is estimated at about 100,000 tons from about
170,000 ha (1971). Annual average yield of these ponds is about 570 kg/ha,
which compares to 300 kg/ha in Indonesia and 1,700 kg/ha in Taiwan.



There is scope to increase both the area under fishponds and the yields.
19.     While no specialized fishing port is yet in operation in the
Philippines, Navotas (near Manila) is being developed into a fishing
port with the financial assistance of the Asian Development Bank. The
project, to be completed in 1975, will greatly improve marketing in the
Manila area where a large proportion of total fish consumption takes place.
While projected fish landings may not justify investments in specialized fishing
port facilities at places other than Navotas, there is a growing need for
improved marketing and distribution facilities to handle increased fish
production throughout the Philippines.
20.     There are about 33 shipyards in the country, mostly located near
Manila. About eight of these are capable of constructing steel vessels
up to a size of 1,000 tons. The rest mainly build and repair wooden
vessels. Repair and maintenance facilities for the fishing fleet around
Manila are adequate.
21.     Institutional sources for fisheries credit are commercial banks,
rural banks and the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP).     Credit
from non-institutional sources such as traders, equipment suppliers, etc.,
has become very scarce because of the tight credit situation.     Commercial
banks are a source of Liort-term loans mainly for marine fisheries.     The
rural banks are a source of credit for inland fisheries but have limited
themselves mostly to short-term financing.    DBP is the only major source
of medium- and long-term credit for fisheries development.    Up to mid-
1972 DBP's fisheries loans totalled some $20 million equivalent.     These
loans accounted for about 13 percent of DBP's total loans for agriculture.
However, during the past three years, DBP's loans to this sector have
substantially declined because of lack of funds.
22.     In November 1972, a Presidential decree was promulgated creating
a Fisheries Industry Development Council under the chairmanship of the
Secretary of Agriculture to formulate development policies in this field.
The Department of Agr-iculture coordinates overall policy and the Bureau of
Fisheries (BOF) implements it. The present policy aim is to be self
sufficient in fish products. This means not only more and better equipped
vessels and fishponds. It also means more supporting infrastructure and
improved extension services. The proposed project would help meet these
needs.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
23.     The proposed project was prepared with assistance of a mission
of the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program which visited the Philippines in
January/February 1972 and was appraised by a Bank mission in November.
Loan negotiations were held in Washington from April 16 to 18, 1973. The
leader of the Government's negotiating team was Ambassador Eduardo Z. Romualdez.



7-
The appraisal report (No. 105a-PH dated April 23, 1973) is being distributed
separately to the Executive Directors.
24.     The proposed loan would be the Bank Group's first operation in the
Philippines exclusively for fisheries.
Description of the Project
25.     The project would assist the Government in carrying out its
program of increasing fish production for domestic consumption by pro-viding
supervised credit to be administered by DBP. It would provide credit to
individuals and companies, over a four-year investment period, to finance
marine fisheries including the construction of fishing vessels, ice-making
facilities and slipways and the purchase of fish carriers and equipment.
The project would also help develop inland fisheries by financing the
construction, rehabilitation and improvement of fishponds. The project
includes technical assistance by a marine specialist, a naval architect
and a fish farming extension expert who would assist in implementing it.
It also provides assistance in conducting studies needed to prepare future
projects for fish marketing and smallholder fishponds.
26.     The lending arrangments would be similar to those of the Rice
Processing Project (Loan No. 720-PH) and Livestock Project (Loan No. 823-PH).
The Bank loan would be made to the Government which would bear the foreign
exchange risk and relend the proceeds to DBP under a subsidiary loan
agreement. DBP would onlend the Bank funds, supplemented with its own
resources, to sub-borrowers.
27.     DBP, a wholly owned Government institution, has total resources
of about $4 billion (us $596 million) making it the largest development
bank in the Philippines and the most important source of finance for
agriculture and industry. It has a professional staff of more than 700
including about 200' agriculturalists and engineers and has a wider
experience in fisheries lending than any other institution in the Philippines.
While DBP's overall financial position in the past has given cause for
concern, it came under new management in 1970 and since then its financial
situation has improved steadily. A loan of us$50 million to DBP from an
international banking consortium,signed last year in London, will help to
relieve the heavy pressure on DBP arising from debt service obligations
incurred as a result of its guaranteeing a large amount of private foreign
borrowing in the late 1960's. After the peso devaluation of 1970, many
borrowers defaulted, leaving DBP to make good on its guarantees. Since
then it has succeeded in collecting a substantial part of the loans in
default and has foreclosed on collateral in other cases.
28.     The proposed project would assist DBP to expand its lending for
fisheries development and would improve the technical and administrative
operations of its Fisheries Group. DBP has agreed to appropriate changes
in the organization and lending procedures of this Group. The Bureau of
Fisheries through its extension services has agreed to assist with technical



- a -
appraisal and to provide technical supervision and guidance to the sub-
borrowers. In order to do this the Bureau has agreed to employ a fish
farming (aquaculture) extension and training specialist to train its own
and DBP's Dersonnel for extension and appraisal using the facilities of
the University of the Philippines (Fisheries College).
I'ost and F'inancing of the Project
29.     The total cost of the project is    $18.5 million with an estimated
foreign exchange cost of about $8.4 million.   The Bank loan of    $11.6
million would finance about 63 percent of total cost. It is estimated
the loan would cover the full foreign exchange cost of the marine fisheries
component and technical assistance and 50 percent of the total cost of the
fish-pond component which has an average foreign exchange component of
only about 10 percent.    Operators would finance on average approximately
14 percent, of project cost from their ovm resources and th_ remainder would
come from DBP.   The financing pattern is set out below:
Sub

Percent of Total          14 %      22 %       1 %      63 %      100 %
The 't3.2 million of local costs that the Bank will finance will be entirely
thr fishpond development, which has great potential for increasing rural
incomes and for improving the diet of the population. It will also help
to reconstruct and improve fishponds damaged in the 1972 floods.
30.     DBP would charge an interest rate of 12 percent on sub-loans.    The
spread between DBP's lending rate and average cost of funds would be 4.5
percent which would be adequate to cover overhead and administrative costs and
leave a reasonable net income.   Sub-loans would be committed over a four-year
period.  Terms of sub-loans would be flexible and based on the needs of
individual sub-projects. On average they would range from 5 to 13 years
including grace periods of 1-3 years.



Project Execution
31.     DBP's Fisheries Group would be responsible for implementing the
credit operations. The Group would be headed by a senior officer. His
staff would be strengthened by experienced technicians, a marine specialist
and a naval architect employed under the technical assistance component.
The Bureau of Fisheries would be responsible for the training program and
the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources would be responsible
for employing and supervising the consultants who would prepare the two
feasibility studies mentioned in para. 25.
Procurement
32.     Sub-borrowers for vessels would mainly be operators who already
own several fishing boats. For this reason, the additional vessels must
be equipped in a manner compatible with the owner's other vessels so as to
minimize the costs of operating and maintaining the owner's total ileet.
The hulls and the equipment would therefore be procured separately. Fishing
vessels hulls would be acquired through local competitive bidding between
prequalified local shipyards while engines, fishing gear and other equipment
to be installed in the hulls would be chosen by individual operators from
qualified suppliers represented or established in the Philippines. Suppliers
not yet established or represented in the Philippines would have an oppor-
tunity to do so since DBP would advertise internationally its intention to
procure this equipment at least three months before quotations for the
equipment were invited.  Equipment for vessel improvements would be acquLred
through normal trade channels because of the need to match and complement
existing equipment. Second-hand carriers would be procured from abroad by
advertising vessel specifications in potential supplier countries and
allowing sub-borrowers to choose from lists containing surveyed and suitable
carriers.Turnkey contracts for construction of ice-making facilities and
slipways would be awarded after international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Competitive bidding for fishpond
rehabilitation and development would not be appropriate because individual
needs vary, sites are scattered and the work would be mainly performed by
manual labor. Fishpond operators would therefore make arrangements,
approved by DBP, for labor or contractors in their area to carry out the
work.
Disbursement
33.     The loan would be disbursed to meet the full amount of DMP sub-loans
(equivalent to the estimated foreign exchange cost) for all items except
fishponds where 56 percent of DBP sub-loans (equivalent to 50 percent of
sub-project cost) would be met. Disbursements would also cover the full
foreign exchange cost or 90 percent of the total cost of technical assistance.
Economic Justification
34.     The project forms an important part of the Government's efforts to
increase fish production, the major source of animal protein in the
Philippines. At full development, i.e. within eight years, the project
would have increased fish production by about h8,o00 tons a year, equal to



- 10 -
about 5 percent of present fish production and valued at about US$13.2
million. The economic rate of return is estimated at 34 percent with a
rate of 22 percent for the marine fisheries conmonent and 43 percent ior
the inland fisheries component.   Financial rates of return (after taxes)
would vary from 20 to 27 percent for new investments and from b6 to 82
percent for supplementary investments, clearly high enough to create a
demand for credit facilities under the project.   The project would benefit
about 1,100 sub-borrowers and their dependents, provide about 2,400
permanent positions for unskilled and semi-skilled fishermen and labor and
employ about 4,000 unskilled labor per annum during the 4-year investment
period. The project would also help the future development of fisheries
by increasing knowledge of marine resources, demonstrating the value of

. .rojects in Lxecution
Loani 4.l-H-1  - Fourth Power
This project was -to assist the National F'ower Corporation (NPC) in
fiinancing the construction of a 74-TT-P  thermal plant on the '3ataan Peninsula
and a P)-'' addition to the Maria Christina THydroelectric 'lant in Mindanao.
Ine e  aria Christina addition was completed in 1970.  The Rataan thermal unit
lias scheduled for final acceptance in December 1972, about two years behind
schedule. 'i'he delay was due initially to slow government approval of contract
awards and subsequently to financial difficulties of the civil works contractor
and mechanical failures.  The undisbursed balance of l.3 mi]lion of the Bank
loan represents the retention requirements for equipment su5pplLed under the
project. The Closing Date has been further postponed by 18 months to December 31,
1')73.
Loan 6U7-PH - ,econd Rural Credit
The slow progress of the Project at first was mainly due to the steep
rise in prices of farm machinery after the peso was allowed to float in
1'ebruary 1970. The subsequent increases in prices of farm produce, together
with decentralization of loan sanctioning, strengthening of staff and promotion-
al efforts, have helped improve the pace of disbursements.   The Closing Date,
originally March 31, 1973, has been postponed to June 30, 1974, when present
projections indicate that the loan would be fully disbursed.
Loan 630-rH - Development Finance Company
The third loan in an amount of $25 million f)r the Private Develop-
ment Corporation of the Philippines (PDCP) has been fully committed for sub-
.rojects, but as of March 31, 1973, f1.3 million of the loan remained undisbursed.
The Closing Date has been further postponed from March 31, 1973 to September 30,
1973.   An unused balance of about $800,000 has been cancelled.
Loan 637-l'i - Irrigation
This project is to help finance the construction of a dam on the Upper
Panmanga River in Central Luzon and the construction and rehabilitation of
irrigation facilities serving about 70,000 hectares. The project got off to a
good start and is progressing sat-isfactorily.
Loan 720-PH - Rice Processing and Storage
This uroject was designed to provide long-term credit to the private
sector f'or setting up modern integrated rice processing and storage units.
_1/ These notes are designed to inform the EBcecutive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.   They
should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not
ruroort to present a balanced evraluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.



ANNEX II
Page a of 4
Disbursement has been very slow in part because of the deterioration in the
investment climate following the peso devaluation. Another factor was the
detrilmental effect of poor weather, disease and reduced use of fertilizer
due to credi-t reslrictions, on the 1970/71 rice crops. There was consequently
a lower dem;and for investment in new integrated storage units. The project
was substantially revised in accordance with the memorandum of the President
to the Executive Directors dated June 8, 1972 (R72-40) to allow for more
emphasis on lending for rehabilitation and improvement of existing facilities,
and to simplify administrative arrangements and procedures.    These changes
have produced a number of' Inew loan requests. However, a supervision mission
which visited planila in February 1973 has reported that the project is still
moving slowly and discussions are continuing with the Philippine authorities
on measures to speed up disbursements.   These measures include streamlinirng
procurement procedures and intensifying the promotional efforts of DBP.
Loan 731-PH - Highway
The project for the construction and improvement of the Cotabato-
Digos road (160 km) in Mindanao is in general progressing satisfactorily.
Work was, however, suspended in March 1973 because of civil disturbances in
the Cotabato area, but the contractor has since resumed work from the Digos
end which is outside the area affected by the fighting. The project also
includes two components financed by UPDP: technical assistance to the
Bureau of Public Highways (BPH) for operational improvements and feasibility
studies for future highway projects.   Work on the technical assistance
component is progressing well and the feasibility studies have been completed.
Loan 809-PFH and Credit 296-PH - E fth Power
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance the construction of a second thermal unit of 150 MW at Bataan and
transmission facilities in Luzon. Tne project is behind schedule because
procurement has taken longer than expected.   Further tariff increases are
expected in the first half of 1973 to achieve a rate of return of 8 percent
in FY74 and thereafter as required under the Loan Agreement.    S-teps have
also been taken by the Government to coordinate the planning and implementa-
tioin of fuLure power development.
Loan 823-PH - Livestock
The project is assisting the Government in carrying out its livestock
development program through supervised credit by the Development Bank of the
Philippines with assistance of consultants. The loan became effective on
November 9, 1972. The project is progressing satisfactorily.
Credit 340-PH - Second Education
The credit was signed on January 5 and became ef'fective April 11,
1973.  The project will assist improvements in such areas as education
planning, management and curriculum development, science teacher training,
training of technicians for industry and agriculture, and training of
skilled craftsmen and farmers.
