PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES FIRST AND SECOND FISHERIES PROJECTS
________  __ (LOANS 891-PH AND 1270-PH)
PREFACE
This is a performance audit for the First and Second Fisheries
Credit projects, for which a loan was approved in May 1973 for US$11.6 million
and a further loan in May 1976 for US$12 million.     Final disbursement for the
first project was made on August 23, 1979, the loan was closed on August 23,
1979 while that for the second project on February 27, 1981 closed on June 30,
1981.
The audit report consists of an audit memorandum prepared by the
Operations Evaluation Department and two Project Completion Reports dated
July 22, 1980 and July 1982.      The first PCR was prepared by the East Asia
and Pacific Regional Office on the basis of a country visit in January and
February 1980. The PCR for the second project was prepared by the Development
Bank of the Philippines (DBP).    The audit memorandum is based on a review of
the Appraisal Reports (105A-PH and 1101B-PH) dated April 23, 1973 and May 7,
1976 respectively, the President's Reports (P-1213-PH and P-1850-PH) dated
May 2, 1973 and May 13, 1976, and the PCRs. Internal Bank memoranda on
project issues as contained in relevant Bank files have also been consulted
and Bank staff associated with the projects have been interviewed.
An OED mission visited the Philippines in November 1981.      In addi-
tion to discussions with staff of the Ministry of Natural Resources, Bureau of
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and the Development Bank of the Philippines,
visits were made to Iloilo and Bacolod.     The information obtained during the
mission was used to test the validity and conclusions of the PCRs.
The draft report was sent to the Borrower for comment on April 24,
1982. Borrower comments are attached to the audit memorandum.
The audit finds that the PCRs cover the projects' salient features
adequately and the Project Performance Audit Memorandum generally agrees with
their conclusions.    In addition   to summarizing the objectives of the two
projects and highlighting their satisfactory outcome, for which considerable
credit must be given to DBP and Bank staff concerned with project implementa-
tion and supervision, there are some features which give rise to concern.
These include the provision of technical guidance and supervision to sub-
borrowers; the future viability of certain shore facilities and the organiza-
tion and funding of the exploration fishing survey.
The valuable assistance provided by the Government of the Philip-
pines and by the staff of the Development Bank of the Philippines is grate-
fully acknowledged.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES FIRST AND SECOND FISHERIES PROJECTS
(LOANS 891-PH AND 1270-PH)
HIGHLIGHTS
These projects aimed at developing inland and marine fisheries
in support of the government's goal of self-sufficiency in fish production.
Both projects also contained institution-building objectives in respect of the
Development Bank of the Philippines, which was responsible for implementation.
Fisheries I was the first Bank loan to finance inland fish pond development;
it was expected that the introduction of fresh water fish cultivation in areas
with only limited alternative opportunities for employment would contribute
measurably to increased incomes.      As the Bank's first major loan to the
Philippines for fisheries development, the project also provided funds for
surveys to assess the resource base for future fishery development programs.
Fisheries II was essentially a continuation of the strategy developed for the
first project.
At appraisal the first project was estimated to cost US$18.5 million
of which IBRD would provide US$11.6 million.       The second totalled US$23.5
million with the Bank financing US$12 million.
Implementation of both projects has been sharply affected by the
1973/74 oil crisis.    The marine component of both projects, but principally
the first, experienced rapid cost increases for construction of new vessels
and in respect of operating costs. As a result only about half the 60 vessels
expected to be financed under the project were built, furthermore, most were
purse seiners rather than the trawlers anticipated at appraisal.      This trend
towards smaller and less costly marine vessels continued under the second
project. Rising construction and operating costs also affected inland fresh
water fish pond development, more particularly under the second project.
Financial returns are no longer attractive for new fish ponds, although
returns for rehabilitated ponds continue at a level which is satisfactory,
even though lower than expected at appraisal.     Employment resulting from the
project has, however, exceeded original expectations primarily because of
increased labor intensity; incomes have also increased for between 65-72% of
fish pond operators.
Both projects had positive institution-building effects although
there is room for improvement.     Sub-borrowers in both the marine and inland
sectors requested additional technical support, particularly during implemen-
tation. This lack of supervision, which has become an increasingly important
omission as costs have risen thereby requiring greater efficiency of re-
sources, is the principal reason for the high proportion of loan arrears.     In
1980, the year for which the most recent data is available, collections for
sub-loans extended under the project amounted to only 28% of total collect-
ibles.   This is having a significant effect on DBP's financial position.



These two projects offer the following lessons:
the need for more critical examination of national trained manpower
resources during preparation and appraisal to insure that adequate
provision is made for technical assistance and training of key local
personnel (PPAM, paras. 23-26).
the need   to deploy more    technical  expertise during supervision
of fisheries projects than has been the case (PPAM, paras. 22, 41
and 42).
the need to enforce regular project reporting and sample surveys
early on in the project to ensure proper and timely evaluation at
the project completion stage (PPAM, para. 18, and PCR, para. 4.03).
Points of special interest are:
inter-departmental    coordination in planning fishing industry
requirements could be considerably strengthened (PPAM, paras. 37-
41).
studies and the test fishing program initiated as a result of
the first project have been disappointing (PPAM, paras. 27-29).
bank supervision missions can be ineffective if required to super-
vise too wide a range of projects within a short period of time
(PPAM, para. 42).

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT MEMORANDUM
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES FIRST AND SECOND FISHERIES PROJECTS
(LOANS 891-PH AND 1270-PH)
I. SUMMARY
1.        The First Project was appraised in November 1972; the Second Project
in September 1975, very shortly after the launching of the first trawler
completed under Fisheries I.     Both projects were designed to increase fish
production by expanding the fish farming and offshore commercial fishing
subsectors and were executed by the Development Bank of the Philippines
(DBP) in collaboration with the Government's Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic
Resources (BFAR).
2.        An FAO/CP mission identified and prepared the First Project during a
visit to the Philippines in January-February 1972.     Originally, it provided
for:
(a) the construction and/or rehabilitation of 12,000 ha of fishponds
mainly for milkfish (Chanos chanos) production;
(b) the construction of 60 fishing vessels of between 70 gross tons and
130 G.T. each;
(c) the acquisition of 10 imported second-hand fish carrier vessels;
(d) the modernization of up to 100 existing fishing vessels;
(e) the construction of 3 ice plants and 2 slipways;
(f) the cost of two studies by consultants, one focussing on the
national fish marketing and distribution system and the other on a
smallholder fish pond project;
(g) further technical assistance by a marine specialist and a naval
architect to undertake vessel design and construction specification
and generally to assist DBP marine sector lending, and a fish
farming extension expert to train BFAR extension workers and DBP
inland fisheries appraisal staff.     The recruitment of these three
experts was stipulated as a condition of loan effectiveness;
(h) the project also included agreement that BFAR would undertake at its
own expense an exploratory fishing survey, using its existing
research vessel fleet in Southern Philippines waters, in an effort
to locate new fishing grounds and additional fish stocks for the
growing commercial fishing fleet.



3.        The Second Fisheries Project, which was essentially a continuation
of the First, was prepared by DBP and provided for:
(a)  the construction and/or rehabilitation of an additional 9,000 ha of
fishponds;
(b)  the construction of 17 fishing vessels of 45-90 G.T. each;
(c)  the modification of four     local vessels   to become carriers;   and
(d)  the construction of three ice plants and one slipway.
4.        Following approval of the original loan in May 1973, DBP experienced
some delay in recruiting the two marine specialists. In consequence, although
the fish pond component was declared effective in June 1973, the marine
fisheries component did not become effective until December 1973 following a
bilateral aid agreement with the United Kingdom to provide the necessary
expertise. The Second Project became effective in November 1976, on schedule,
some four months after the Agreement was signed.
5.        The 1973/74 oil crisis and resultant steep cost escalation had a
fundamental effect on the First Project's marine component and to a lesser
extent also on that of the Second Project.       The cost of a 70 G.T. vessel,
which at appraisal in 1972 was estimated at US$60,000, had increased to
US$200,000 by 1976.    Part of this increase was, however, caused by the re-
design of traditional hulls to more acceptable stability standards, by
increasing beam to length ratios and by insistence on stricter construction
specifications and timber quality standards.     The sharply increased cost of
steel directly attributable to oil-price rises, meant that new steel vessels
were no longer economical under local conditions and the 15 projected vessels
of this type had to be eliminated.     In consequence, only 35 of the projected
60 vessels under Fisheries I were financed) all in the 70-95 G.T. class and
built of wood, despite the fact that wood also doubled in price during the
course of the project.    Furthermore, as time went on, it became increasingly
difficult to obtain lumber of suitable size and quality.
6.        The effect of rising oil prices on vessel operating costs also
increased in severity during the project period. Diesel fuel more than
quadrupled in cost between 1975 and 1980, and by 1979 accounted for about
55% of trawler operating costs.      Fishing gear, mostly made nowadays from
petroleum-based synthetic fibers, also showed similar price rises, whereas
catch values only increased by about 50% over the same period. Purse seiners
were found to be more fuel efficient than trawlers - fuel accounting for only
about 40% of operating costs - so that 12 of the 35 vessels built under
Fisheries I were equipped as purse seiners, whereas at appraisal, it was
envisaged that all of the vessels would be trawlers, except for the 130 G.T.
class steel vessels which were eliminated from the project.     In addition, the
1975 Presidential Decree which amongst other measures, excluded trawlers from
the coastal zones was a necessary step, but one which caused a marked decline
in trawler catch rates.



7.        The  trend continued into Fisheries     II, with 29 purse seinersl/
built of the total of 47 craft.2/     A further consequence was a progressive
departure from appraisal guidelines in the matter of vessel size and power in
favor of smaller and less costly vessels.      This was particularly marked in
Fisheries II when in place of the projected fourteen 90 G.T. and three
45 G.T. vessels, 16 vessels were built ranging in size from 12 to 50 G.T.,
and 27 larger vessels (80 G.T. and up),3/ most of which were purse seiners
designed to work the more distant Palawan fishing grounds.     Rising costs also
tended to limit fishing by most vessels, other than the larger purse seiners,
to nearby already heavily-fished waters and to a reduced number of fishing
days - 215 days/year for trawlers and 218 days for most purse seiners, in both
cases only about 80% of DBP projections.     The trend towards smaller vessels
has also continued into the third Fisheries and Livestock project.
8.        Only one of the three ice plants projected in Fisheries I was
financed, apparently because clients could obtain better terms under the Small
and Medium Industry Development project (Loan 1120-PH), but conversely, all
three loans for the ice plants projected in Fisheries II were made.4/        Two
slipways were projected in Fisheries I and one in Fisheries II, but only one
was built.    The two projects contained provision for 14 fish carriers, but
partly because of the requirement for international competitive bidding, none
were taken up, although BFAR statistics do show an increase in the carrier
fleet from 241 in 1977 to 302 in 1980. Few applications for vessel moderniza-
tion were approved because the main interest of the industry was in re-
engining generally obsolete vessels rather than up-grading serviceable vessels
with additional modern equipment.5/
9.        The inland fish ponds component was also affected by inflation.
The total area financed from Fisheries I at 12,728 ha exceeded appraisal
estimates by 7%, with average yields also slightly better than appraisal
estimates. The area developed during Fisheries II is 13,459 ha which compares
very favorably with the appraisal targets of 9,100 ha of new and rehabilitated
ponds.   The average cost of pond development per ha was P6,000 during Fish-
eries I against the appraisal estimate of P5,000 per ha.     The latest figures
for Fisheries II indicate a development cost of P35,000-40,000 per ha for
the fishponds and P19,900-22,800 for partially developed ponds.

while two trawlers were re-engined.



- 4 -
10.       Fish pond operating costs are also increasing at a rate which is
giving rise to some concern.    The ex-farm price of fish has been stable for
the last two years at p5.50 to P6.50 per kg, but input costs have increased,
in the case of fertilizer by 19%, organic manure by 20%, and milkfish fry by
30% in the same period. Recent increases in interest rates charged by DBP on
loans are also worrying many borrowers, to the extent that the cumulative
effect of rising costs may cause some fish farmers to start economizing on
inputs, even though this will cause a decline in yield from their ponds.
11.       The provision of marine specialists envisaged at appraisal, but
supplied under bilateral aid arrangements, had an important institution-
building effect for the project in general and for DBP in particular.     Their
services produced significant improvements in the quality of vessel construc-
tion in several Philippine boat yards, and by a combination of on-the-job and
overseas training of key DBP specialist staff, promoted a higher degree of
staff capability, deepening DBP's involvement in and understanding of the
fisheries sector.
12.       The training program for BFAR fish farming extension personnel and
DBP inland fisheries appraisal staff, under BFAR direction and utilizing the
services of an expatriate aquaculture extension expert, proved highly success-
ful. The program has produced a number of highly qualified staff and teach-
ing aides whose services are clearly well appreciated by the fish farming
industry.   However, the numbers of trained extension workers in relation to
the geographic areas they have to cover is still far from adequate.
13.       The project's test fishing program, carried out by BFAR to explore
the potential of new fishing grounds in the southern part of the Philippines
was less successful, mainly because of operational difficulties experienced
with the three rather elderly BFAR research vessels.      In consequence, rela-
tively little information was obtained of value to the commerical fishing
fleet.
14.       The Smallholder Fish Pond Study developed a "fish pond estate"
concept which, although of interest to Government in terms of providing
smallholder involvement on a large scale, has not found practical application
so far, mainly because of its substantial minimum size and the need for
extensive prior engineering studies and costs. The Fish Marketing and Distri-
bution Study resulted in the collation of a large volume of information but
did not result, rather disappointingly, in the identification of any specific
projects for future external financing.
15.       Development of cooperative arrangements between DBP and BFAR
proceeded very slowly and only became operationally significant towards the
end of Fisheries I after an agreement was concluded in 1978 to collaborate
in the provision of technical support to fish pond borrowers.        As regards
marine fisheries, technical support has been extended only by DBP's own
marine staff and consultants, and mainly in respect of vessel design and
construction.   DBP has not sought, and BFAR has not extended on its own any
assistance in this field, although there is clearly an unfulfilled need. Many



- 5 -
marine proponents have stressed the need for technical assistance after the
completion of vessel construction, during the start up period of vessel
operations when new operators are gaining familiarity with their new vessels
and equipment.    This particularly applies to such matters as the correct
design and use of fishing gear, the use and maintenance of electronic and
acoustic fishing aids, care and handling of the catch and crew training, etc.
There is evidence to suggest that DBP/BFAR's inability to provide such assis-
tance, as part of the general supervisory function, is a contributory factor
to the very rapid increase in the number of sub-loans which have fallen into
arrears.   The lack of appropriately qualified staff in these fields should
have been identified in time for remedial provision to have been included in
Fisheries II.
16.       DBP performance in general appears to have been very good.      With
the establishment of a Fisheries Group within its Agricultural Projects
Department, DBP was able to deploy an effective and well qualified team to
the tasks of appraising and supervising loan applications and their imple-
mentation.   During both projects, and especially during the latter stages of
Fisheries II, extra emphasis was placed on sub-loan recoveries, despite which,
the growth in arrears must occasion considerable concern.   Foreclosure action
has already had to be taken on some fishing vessel sub-loans, and more cases
are under consideration.
17.       Procurement procedures were modified during implementation in
efforts, not always successfully, to make them more responsive to changing
circumstances. Fisheries I disbursements were ahead of schedule during
1974 and 1975, but slowed down during 1976 when DBP was involved in the
promotion of large, socially oriented governmental lending programs and
other major activities.    There was a period during 1977/78 when Fisheries
II lending to the marine sector slowed down whilst an attempt was made to
introduce a system of local competitive bidding, but accelerated again
after the idea was dropped, having unfortunately proved counter-productive.
In the end, Fisheries I was fully disbursed only two months later than the
original Closing Date, and Fisheries II was completed three months ahead of
schedule,l/ performances which reflect considerable credit on the DBP staff
concerned.
18.       In general, DBP complied with all loan covenants except that sample
sub-borrower monitoring studies were only being initiated on an ad hoc basis
during the final year of Fisheries I.      To date, this still remains to be
organized as a regular and continuous activity.
19.       It is not possible to measure the overall impact of either project
with any degree of accuracy because of insufficient data and often conflicting
statistics. However, it is clear that the fish ponds financed under Fisheries
I achieved higher levels of productivity than estimated at appraisal, and
1/   But as DBP points out the Loan was only fully disbursed three months
after the original Closing Date (see Borrower comments).

that Fisheries II fish ponds appear to have performed at least as well as
projected. In contrast, the Fisheries I marine sector seems to have achieved
little better than half of the incremental production estimated at appraisal.
The sector is, however, well-known for its reluctance to disclose full quanti-
ties of fish caught or details of earnings and the statistics are, there-
fore, in doubt.   As regards Fisheries II vessels, the smaller trawlers (19-40
G.T.) and the larger purse seiners are proving most productive, whereas
trawlers and seiners in the 50-95 G.T. classes are having difficulty in
breaking even.1/    Comparison with appraisal estimates for Fisheries II is
difficult because the majority of vessels were built in sizes either smaller
or larger than appraisal guidelines.
20.       In mid-1980, the completion mission for Fisheries I assessed the
financial rates of return on an average 25 ha fish farm as ranging between
29% and 59%, depending on the state of development, with economic rates of
return varying from 26% to 53%.     The FRR on a 75 G.T. trawler was assessed
at about 22% and the ERR at about 28%.     At that stage, the returns were in
line with or better than the rates estimated at appraisal. As regards
Fisheries II, and pending completion of a sub-borrower survey which DBP was
only on the point of starting at the end of 1981, no figures are available
on which to base rates of return calculations.       It is believed, however,
that fish farm returns should show only a marginal reduction, if any, on
appraisal estimates, but in the marine sector it seems inevitable that the
50-95 G.T. vessel classes will fail to achieve appraisal target rates.
Their failure may be sufficiently offset, however, by better returns from
the smaller trawlers and largest purse seiners to give overall FRR and ERR
figures close to appraisal estimates.
21.       The non-quantifiable benefits of the projects have been signifi-
cant.   Fisheries  I, in particular, represented an important institution-
building undertaking as far as DBP was concerned and, to a lesser extent,
also  BFAR.    Both  projects provided  incremental employment opportunities,
expanded the knowledge of new technologies and improved the dissemination
of such information by means of enlarged extension operations.     The projects
promoted vessels with better sea-keeping qualities, and the vessel construc-
tion programs not only created additional employment in small boat building
yards but spread the improved designs and higher standards of vessel con-
struction to various parts of the country.
22.       Supervision of the two projects by Bank staff was generally adequate
in terms of numbers and frequency of visits.       During the early stages of
Fisheries I, supervision mission members undertook several field visits to
inspect work in progress, but few, if any, of the later supervision reports
include any mention of visits to centers outside Manila.    While the Bank was
certainly responsive to changed circumstances resulting from the 1973/74 fuel
oil crisis, performance might have been significantly improved by more fish-
eries technological input during the later stages of#supervision, more field
1/   DBP points out (see Borrower comments) that in its survey, undertaken in
preparation of the PCR for Fisheries II, there are strong indications
that all classes of fishing vessels, except purse seiners with inadequate
facilities, are currently operating profitably because of higher prices
for fish.

inspection visits and, notwithstanding the need for economies in supervision
costs, by less frequent recourse to the practice of assigning multi-project
responsibilities to single missions.
II. MAIN ISSUES
A.   Provision of Technical Guidance to Inland and Marine Borrowers
23.       Largely as a result of Fisheries I, supplemented by bilateral
technical assistance and overseas training, DBP created a range of technical
competence within its Fisheries Group.l/     Such skills were suitable both for
the task of appraising loan applications from both marine and inland sectors,
and for supervising the construction stages of such subloans.2/        Neverthe-
less, many of the marine sub-borrowers interviewed by the project comple-
tion and project audit missions stressed the need for technical assistance
after the completion of vessel construction, during the start up period of
vessel operations when new operators are gaining familiarity with their new
vessels and equipment.
24.       This requirement might have been foreseen at the start of Fisheries
I, but at the very least, should have been included in the terms of reference
for Fisheries II. DBP Fisheries Group staffing does not include expertise in
such matters as the design and use of fishing gear, the use and maintenance of
electronic and acoustic fishing aids, care and handling of the catch and crew
training etc., and the BFAR establishment also contains very few people
possessing  these skills.    Thus,  the needs remain largely unsatisfied and
vessel owners are denied the sort of guidance on improvements to fishing
efficiency which could significantly increase vessel earnings and thus reduce
the growth of loans in arrears.
25.       The provision of a fish farming extension expert enabled BFAR to
improve the quality of its inland extension service for fish farmers in
general.   Following the 1978 Agreement between BFAR and DBP, there was a
belated but marked improvement in the provision of technical assistance to
DBP's fish pond borrowers.    This particularly in respect of drawing up tech-
nical plans for fish pond development, supervising pond construction and
conducting regular visits to provide operational guidance. However, as noted
in the Fisheries I PCR,3/ it was not possible to implement the Agreement
evenly throughout all the regions, and even where it was applied, the numbers
of trained extension workers were barely adequate to meet the needs of fish
farm borrowers, considering their numbers and wide geographical distribution.
1/   The region considers that DBP's role is to provide finance and that it
should draw on technical services from elsewhere as necessary.
2/   PCR Fisheries I, para. 3.53.
3/   PCR Fisheries I, para. 3.51.



A further concern, as expressed by one BFAR provincial head, was that the
assignment of two of his staff to concentrate on DBP sub-borrower needs was
not accompanied by any increase in his establishment, and therefore served
only to dilute the extension service he could offer to all the other fish
farmers in his province.
26.       There is a clear need for project preparation and appraisal to give
more thorough consideration to the numbers and calibre of trained staff avail-
able to organizations responsible for providing essential back-up services to
these lending programs.     In this case, more definite targets, as regards
numbers of BFAR and DBP personnel to be trained, should have been set for the
Fisheries I training program, and     Fisheries II should also have contained
provision for training additional staff.
B.   Conduct of Exploratory Fishing Surveys
27.       As noted in the Completion Report!/, the second of the two compo-
nents to be carried out by BFAR was a test fishing program to be conducted by
three BFAR research vessels using purse seines, trawls and long lines to
explore the potential of new fishing grounds in the southern part of the
Philippines.   The results were disappointing.    BFAR experienced considerable
difficulty in keeping the three rather elderly vessels in working order in
areas far distant from their home base.     The report makes no mention of crew
difficulties, although it seems probable that this may have been an additional
factor.   It is not uncommon to find that research vessel crews, who are paid
fixed wages, lack the incentive or motivation of commercial fishermen to work
long hard hours for weeks on end, under conditions of considerable discomfort.
28.       An alternative approach worth considering in such circumstances, is
to charter commercial fishing vessels with their crews to carry out the
exploratory work, and to assign a fishery officer to sail on the vessel to
record the results and ensure that the vessel does fulfill the charter condi-
tions.   A significant advantage of this approach is that any worthwhile dis-
coveries are immediately fully known to at least the one commercial vessel and
it does not take long for others to follow in its wake when they see one of
their number landing a good catch. This resolves the problem of disseminating
information about new fishing grounds to the fishing fleet, which is often
suspicious and reluctant to take up advice proferred by research ships.
29.       Given that nearby fishing areas in Manila Bay and the Visayan Sea
were known to be heavily fished even before the start of Fisheries I, insuffi-
cient importance seems to have been accorded during preparation and appraisal
to the need to locate new grounds and so disperse overall fishing effort over
a much wider area.    It is thus unfortunate that the nature and scope of the
exploratory fishing survey was not defined in greater detail and that it was
not included for financial support.      It is still not too late, and it is

recommended that provision be included in later projects for a revival of
this activity, including trials with other less fuel-costly methods such as
mechanized line jigging and set-net fishing.l/
C.   Fishing Vessel Performance
30.       One project objective in funding the construction of new fishing
vessels, was that they would be acquired, either singly or jointly by cap-
tains, master fishermen and other crewmembers. Thus, at one stage, DBP waived
the standing requirement regarding real estate security and made loans only
on the security of the boat itself.2/ This objective went largely unfulfilled
because very few fishing captains possessed sufficient cash, let alone real
estate, to qualify for the size of loan needed for the vessels built during
Fisheries I.    Indications are that some captains would have been able to
qualify for the smaller and less costly Fisheries II vessels, but by then the
requirement for collateral in the form of real estate had been reintroduced.
31.       Analysis of the sub-loans indicates three main categories of
borrowers:
(a) companies - some of which had prior connections with fishing either
on the marketing side, or as agents for marine engines, etc.;
(b) owners of existing fishing vessels who wished either to replace
obsolete trawlers, or to expand their fleet;
(c)  individual  businessmen,   sugar  plantation  owners  or professional
people, having little or no prior connection with the fishing
industry, but who took advantage of relatively cheap loans to
diversify their investments and business interests.     The borrowers
had to rely on the technical skills of captains and crews whom they
employed to operate the vessels.
Although the finding is not conclusive, the first two categories of borrowers
have experienced less trouble in keeping up with loan repayments, whereas the
majority of loans in arrears fall in the third category.3/      This is not too
surprising because the successful management of a fishing enterprise demands
broad knowledge of fishing, of vessel operation and maintenance, and most
particularly, detailed knowledge of the intricacies of the fish trade.
1/   DBP agrees:    "we now fully realize the benefits that could have been
derived....had the projects provided for financial support in the under-
taking  of a comprehensive    marine  resource  assessment"  (see Borrower
comments).
2/   PCR Fisheries I, para. 3.35.
3/   DBP also points out that the bulk of the problem accounts in terms of
arrears are with borrowers who have obtained liberal collateral and
equity terms (see Borrower comments).



- 10 -
32.       Captains and crews are paid basic wages with a bonus on vessel
earnings which is intended to provide a suitable incentive. Overall, however,
their earnings are not particularly high, (P1,200 to P2,000 per month,
inclusive of basic wage and bonus was quoted as average pay for captains) with
purse seine captains commanding rather higher payments than trawlermen.
Several people spoken to asserted that crews often sold part of the catch
illegally to supplement their own wages to the detriment of the owner's
income._/  Thus, although owners were dependent on the expertise of captains
and crews, they tended to put only a low value on that knowledge relative to
their own investment in the vessel, instead of recognizing their mutual
dependence.
33.       The original aim of captain participation in vessel ownership could
be combined with the best long-term interests of the investor if the owner
assigns a share of the vessel to the captain in a form of partnership, not-
withstanding the captain's lack of finance.      A partnership agreement which
enables the captain to increase progressively his share from vessel earnings
would provide the sort of incentive needed to ensure maximum effort and care
of the vessel and equipment while minimizing the risk of misappropriation of
the catch. Such arrangements are common in several parts of the world to the
mutual benefit of both parties, and would be well worth encouraging in the
Philippines as another means of reducing the growth of loans in arrears.
D.   DBP On-Lending Policy
34.       Two issues dominated discussions with borrowers in both the inland
and marine sectors.     Firstly,  the question of interest rates, which have
recently increased, and secondly, the requirement for collateral in the form
of real estate.   Interest rates clearly have to reflect DBP's administrative
costs and the cost of borrowing.     So long as DPB's rates are less than the
cost of borrowing from commercial banks, borrowers have few grounds for
complaint.    As regards collateral,   applicants  for fish farming sub-loans
should have little difficulty in providing the necessary security, whereas
prospective marine sector borrowers may have more problems.
35.       Experience to date, especially with the category of fishing vessel
borrower who lacks prior experience of fishing, provides every justification
for continuing to demand security.    The present level of 25% self-financing
does not seem unreasonable, if only as a means to deter those who would be
most likely to fall into arrears as difficulties and demands for expert
management increase.   On the other hand, there does seem to be a fair case to
argue on behalf of proponents who do possess appropriate experience, but who
lack the necessary unencumbered real estate.     This applies particularly to
those who already have an earlier loan which is being kept up to date by means
of good management, but who see an opportunity to expand.       Such borrowers
could be offered loans on slightly easier terms as regards collateral.
1/   This is also inferred in the footnote to PCR Fisheries I, para. 5.08.



- 11 -
36.       The pattern to date has been all or nothing, at one time all bor-
rowers had to provide a certain level of security to qualify, the requirement
was then relaxed for all loans but later reintroduced. It is suggested that,
within the basic guidelines, there should be flexibility to fit the collateral
requirement to the circumstances of the particular application, based on an
assessment of the risk involved in each individual case.l/
E.   Government Planning Procedures
37.       The audit found evidence which indicates that inter-departmental
coordination in planning fishing industry requirements could be improved.
This is particularly important in respect of planning decisions which, at
present, jeopardize the future viability of enterprises already established
with loans from Fisheries I and Fisheries II.
38.       The only slipway funded under the first two projects is located in
Iloilo.   It was inspected during the audit and found to be in working order.
A vessel was on the slip at the time undergoing repair and maintenance.       The
slipway owner asserted that the facility was not yet being used anywhere
near capacity, despite efforts to promote his services for fishing vessels.
The majority of vessel owners apparently still prefer to careen their vessels
on suitable beaches during spring tide periods because it is less costly,
even though the practice tends to encourage marine borer infestation of hull
planking and other possible ill effects.     However, despite the fact that the
existing slipway still has surplus capacity, a start has been made on the
construction of a new fishing port complex at Iloilo under a bilateral aid
program, which includes among other facilities, another marine workshop and
slipway for fishing vessel repairs.
39.       One of the three ice plants funded under Fisheries II is also
located at Iloilo and is capable of producing 90 tons of ice daily.      Current
demand is for about 40 tons daily and the factory is thus substantially
underutilized.   It was, however, pointed out that the new fishing port com-
plex includes additional ice making facilities, which would also appear
unnecessary in the circumstances.2/
40.       Conversely, at Bacolod a number of project vessel owners complained
of a shortage of ice, in that the only bulk ice factory, with a daily output
of 25 tons, was incapable of supplying all their needs and also charged very
high prices.   The lack of ice means that vessels often have to wait several
days after landing a catch before they can be supplied with sufficient ice to
resume fishing.3/
1/   DBP argues that making this recommendation operational is easier said
than done (see Borrower comments).
2/   New Government guidelines have been prepared which would prevent such a
situation from occurring in the future (see Borrower comments).
3/   DBP-s survey confirmed these complaints (see Borrower comments).



- 12 -
41.       These anomalies were not identified by project supervision missions
and brought to the attention of Government for action.       However, this pre-
supposes that each mission would be allocated sufficient time for field visits
outside Manila.    As stated above (para. 22) supervision missions had spent
insufficient time in the field.
F.   Bank Supervision Arrangements
42.       Staff continuity on the supervision missions judging from the
files has been quite adequate, but concern is expressed about the practice of
requiring one mission to supervise a whole range of on-going projects.    During
Fisheries I, supervision mission No. 7, which in addition to doubling as
Fisheries II supervision mission No. 3, was also required to oversee another
seven Bank-supported DBP projects, all within a period of four weeks, and was
thus unable to give more than cursory study to any of them.         The need to
contain supervision costs is acknowledged.     It does not, however, make eco-
nomic or any other kind of sense to cut costs to the extent that a mission can
only devote two or three days to look at the previous six months record of a
complex and costly project, identify incipient problems and devise remedial
action plans, and then have to repeat the process with another totally differ-
ent kind of project.     The members, or on at least one occasion, the sole
member of a mission, no matter how well briefed, cannot possibly be suffi-
ciently familiar with the intricacies of several different projects as to
perform the supervisory role effectively, particularly with such a limited
time scale. It seems essential that the time scale and manpower allocated to
each supervisory mission, to be effective, must err on the side of generosity.
Furthermore, the selection of staff members to perform this function must be
based on their knowledge and understanding of the history of the particular
project and definitely not because the staff member concerned just happened to
be in the area for other reasons.l/
1/   DBP appreciates "the concern raised in the audit over the effectiveness
of supervision missions required to oversee more than one project during
a single mission" (see Borrower comments).

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES FIRST AND SECOND FISHERIES PROJECTS
(LOANS 891-PH AND 1270-PH)
BORROWER COMMENTS
Comments on the First Draft of the Project Performnance Audit Report on the
Philippines First and Second Fisheries Projects (Loan: 891-PH of 1973 &
1270-PH of 1970).
Generally, the observations, issues raised, and findings of the project
performance audit reflected a valid and reasonable assessment of the results
of project operation as of the time of audit. It will be noted, however,
that at the time the audit was conducted in November 1981, DBP was only to
start a survey of sub-projects financed under Fisheries II which provided
the more significant data on project performance as detailed in the PCR of
the Second Fisheries Credit Project. This PCR, therefore, reflects DBP's and
the GOP's official findings and evaluationof project achievements, from where
the following items appear to be inconsistent or not in agreement with the
performance audit report:
1.       Para. 7 - Fisheries II financed 20 purse seiners out of total of 43
units of fishing vessels. Sixteen (16) vessels were built ranging in sizes
between 12-50 GT while twenty-seven (27) units were of the larger types
(80 GT # up). More details are given in Chapter V of the Fisheries II PCR.
The audit report mentioned 29 purse-seiners which may have included six (6)
units of Bagnets and two (2) trawlers converted to purse seiners under this
classification.
2.       Para. 8 - Fisheries II approved loans for the construction of three
(3) ice plants. However only two (2) were actually constructed of which one
(in Iloilo City) is now in operation while the other (in Pagadian City) has
yet to be completed.
As mentioned in item no. 1 above, two (2) units of 90 GT trawlers were con-
verted into purse seiners. In addition, two (2) trawlers were re-engined.
3.       Para. 9 - The average cost of inland fisipond development of 18,500
per ha. for Fisheries II indicated in the audit report is much too low com-
pared to PCR survey results of P35,000 - i,41,000 per ha. for new fishponds
and U19,900 - P22,800 for partially developed ponds.
4.       Para. 17 - Fisheries II was fully disbursed tnree (3) months or one
quarter later than the original Closing Date and not one quarter ahead of
schedule as reported in the audit report.
5.       Para. 19 - While it is of ,eneral belief that statistics on the
marine sector cannot be relied upon, Fisheries II survey finding gave strong
indications that in this sector, all classes of fishing vessels except purse-
seiners with inadequate facilities, are currently operating profitably
because of highler prices of fish nowadays.



- 20 -
6.       Paras. 27 & 29 - W4e now fully realize the benefits that could
have been derived, principally the ability to aave fornulated a lon,,-term
policy of marine fishery development lad tne projects provided for finan-
cial support in the undertakin., of a comnprehensive marine resource assess-
ment.
7.       Para. 30 - The observation is an analysis of a possible reason
for poor loan repayalents by categorizing borrowers on tne basis of trade
experience which is in no way conclusive by itself as tne audit report
also su-tests. One should also relate arrearages to borrower's shared
risk in the project as represented by his equity exposure and collatera-
lized assets. Althougn debatable, our experiences aave snown that sub-
projects with liberal collateral and equity requirements make up the bulk
of our problem accounts.
3.       Paras. 35 & 3t -   Tne argument is well taken but operationalizing
a lendin- program providin, flexibility to fit various circumstances is
easier said than done. Within the constraints i-posed by internal control,
tniis would be ver3 difficult.
9.       Para. 39 -   Under the proposed "Guidelines for the Establishment
of Ice & Cold Storage Plants to Service the FisAing Industry" oeinl finalized
oy the Fishery Industry Develop,ment Council, autnorities would not allow
establishment of new ice plants within any fishing port complex if it can
be serviced by existinc, plants in the area.
10.      Para. 40 -   The new ice factory, reported closed within a day or so
of its commencing operations, was not financed out of a DBP loan,     It was
lathered tnat this plant was constructed by two (2) chinese businessmen
whose operation was opposed by a DBP - financed ice plant with a 285 tons
capacity per day sufficient to supply the normal demand of the area except
during tne pea' fishin, season.    Our own survey confirmed nowever the pre-
sence of complaints ,nentioned in the audit report.
Lastly, we appreciate the cancern raised in the audit report (Paras. 42 &
43) over the effectiveness of supervision missions required to oversee more
tnan one project during a single mission.

PHILIPPINES
FISHERIES CREDIT PROJECT (LOAN 891-PH)
1. PROJECT BACKGROUND AND SECTOR SETTING
1.01      The Republic of the Philippines consists of over 7,000 islands and
islets, with a total land area of about 297,000 sq km. Eleven islands (Luzon,
Mindanao, Samar, Negros, Palawan, Panay, Mindoro, Leyte, Cebu, Bohol and
Masbate) account for 95% of the total land area. Forty five percent of the
population live on the single island of Luzon, where there is a further con-
centration in the center of the island, especially in Metro Manila.
1.02      The Republic is predominantly an agricultural country, with rice and
corn as the staple foods; the contribution of the fishingindustry to GDP is
relatively small (4% in 1972). Nevertheless, at 1972 levels of production the
country ranked about sixteenth among the fishing nations of the world and fish
represented the main source of animal protein in the national diet. With the
achievement of self-sufficiency in rice supplies, increasing attention is
being given to the improvement of the quality of the national diet. Rela-
tively high targets were established under the Four-Year Development Plan
(1971-74) for fisheries as well as livestock products. The Plan aimed to
increase the annual growth of Gross National Product at the rate of 5.5%. In
the fisheries sector the target was to achieve a real annual growth rate of
8%.
1.03      The fishing industry of the Philippines is classified into two major
categories: the marine and inland fisheries. The marine fisheries are further
divided into the municipal fisheries, consisting of small traditional craft
fishing within a three mile limit, and the commercial fisheries made up of
larger vessels (over three gross tons) operating outside that limit. The
inland fisheries are made up of a freshwater sector and a brackish water
sector producing Chanos chanos (milkfish). Basic data on the Philippine
fishing industry are provided in Annex 1.
1.04      In 1972 production /1 by this sector totalled 599,000 tons and
production by the commercial sector totalled about 425,000 tons. As much as
86% of total commercial catch derived from three main fishing grounds, namely
the Sulu Sea, the Visayan Sea and Manila Bay. The area under fishponds
totalled about 174,000 ha, yielding about 100,000 tons.
/1 Although fisheries statistics are improving, in 1972 the data reflected
the Government's judgment as to the degree of underreporting of commercial
catch because of tax implications. The base for fisheries statistics
for the municipal sector was revised in 1978.



- 24 -
1.05      The project represented the first major Bank loan for fisheries
development in the Philippines, although a small component for the development
of fisheries had been provided in the Second Rural Credit Project approved by
the Bank in June 1969.
2. PROJECT FORMULATION
Preparation Stage
2.01      The project was identified by the Philippine Government and prepared
with the assistance of the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program in early 1972./l The
thrust of Government policy was to increase and improve vessel operations in
the municipal and commercial fisheries, and expand the area and raise the
standards of management practices and technology in the inland fisheries.
2.02      It was not clear at the time which banking institution should be
used as the credit channel for the proposed project. The FAO/CP favored the
rural banks. The Bank disagreed because there had been insufficient loan
demand under the Second Rural Credit Project, which included a credit of
US$1.3 million for the development of fishponds through the rural banks./2
The Bank believed that the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) had
sufficient lending experience in the marine as well as the inland fisheries
sector. Due note was taken, however, of the need for organizational and
procedural strengthening of DBP and it was agreed that the project would
incorporate the necessary provisions to this effect.
2.03      At this stage, it was therefore considered preferable to proceed
with a relatively modest first phase project, focusing on fish production
only, with the incremental production restricted to a level which could be
accommodated by existing infrastructure.
2.04      The project as prepared by FAO/CP consisted of two components: (a) a
marine fishery component involving the financing of large trawlers and purse
seiners (20 to 130 GT), and improvement of existing vessels through the
provision of modern deck equipment, electronic equipment and machinery; and
(b) an inland fishery component for financing improvement and expansion of
generally larger fishponds (over 100 ha).
/1  The Cooperative Program also investigated the potential for improved
fishing port facilities. While the estimated fish landings did not justify
investments in fishing port facilities at that stage, the need for
improvement and construction of marketing and distribution facilities was
fully recognized and subsequently the Asian Development Bank (ADB)
financed a major port improvement project in Navotas for Metro Manila.
/2 Under the Rural Banking Act, leases were not acceptable as collateral
for lending by the rural banks.



- 25 -
Appraisal Stage
2.05      The Project was appraised by a Bank mission in Nlovember 1972.     The
mission reformulated the project to change the emphasis in the inland
component from large scale fishponds to smaller fishponds (averaging about
25 ha), for which it was difficult to obtain finance. In the marine sector
the project focused on 70 G.T. to 130 G.T. trawlers and the improvement of
existing vessels. In addition, the mission included a provision for fish
carriers, ice-plants, slipways, technical assistance and training, and two
studies for facilitating fisheries project preparation.
2.06      Project Description.   The broad objectives of the project were to
assist Government to increase fish production for domestic consumption, reduce
constraints hampering long-term development of this sector and prepare a
follow-up project suitable for external financing. The project was to
support, therefore, further development of small- and medium-sized commercial
operations and rehabilitation and improvement of flood-damaged fishponds. In
the marine component, credit was to be provided to finance 60 fishing vessels,
of which 15 were to be of steel construction in the 130 GT class, and 45 of
the 70 GT class of wood construction. The project was also to provide credit
to finance 10 second-hand fish carriers to be acquired on the international
market. Three ice-plants and two slipways were also to be financed. Some 100
vessels were to be improved with the financing of the replacement of obsolete
machinery and addition of complementary equipment such as short-wave radios,
echo-sounders and fish finders. The inland component included rehabilitation
of typhoon damaged brackish water fishponds (4,500 ha) and fishpond improve-
ment and development (7,500 ha). A marine specialist and a naval architect
were to be engaged by DBP. An aquaculture extension expert was to be engaged
by the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) to assist in training
its key extension personnel and DBP's appraisal staff in the inland fisheries
sector. Two studies were to be undertaken to make specific recommendations
towards future external financing, one focusing on the national fish marketing
and distribution system, and the other on a smallholder fishpond (brackish
water) project.
2.07      Project Objectives.   Vessel construction and improvements were to
increase commercial marine fisheries production by about 34,000 tons per annum
at full development, while the inland component would add about 11,000 tons
per annum to fishpond output and restore 3,000 tons per annum of fishpond
production lost as a result of typhoon damage. The value of total incremental
fish production at full development was to be about US$13.2 million per annum.
2.08      The responsibility for credit operations was vested in DBP Fisheries
Group, a part of the Agriculture Projects Department. The Fisheries Group was
to be suitably reorganized and strengthened. Its staff was to be supported by
BFAR's extension staff, particularly in preparing technical appraisals in the
inland fisheries sector. Technical appraisals for marine operations were to
be assisted by the marine specialist. The Government, with the assistance of
consultants, was to prepare the fish marketing and the smallholder fishpond
project.



- 26 -
Effectiveness
2.09      The inland component became effective June 20, 1973.     The marine
component did not become effective until December 6, 1973, when the Bank
waived the remaining condition of effectiveness that a marine specialist and a
naval architect be employed, having received sufficient assurances that the
British bilateral assistance through the White Fish Authority would make the
two specialists available shortly. However, DBP was unable to undertake
lending operations for some time because of staffing constraints caused by
unattractive conditions of employment, substantially below those of the
private sector. Lending for the inland component began as scheduled but
further strengthening of the Fisheries Group's inland fishery staff was slow.
Releases of subloans commenced in June 1973 but subsequently progressed faster
than projected at appraisal.
3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Objectives and Results
3.01      Marine Fisheries.   By the time the various factors delaying the
project start-up were overcome (para. 2.09), the 1973/74 oil crises and the
resulting steep cost escalation began to increasingly affect the original
project targets.   By 1976 the cost of a 70 GT vessel had risen to about
US$200,000 equivalent, compared to US$60,000 at appraisal.
3.02      Spiraling inflation also affected all vessel operating costs,
particularly the fuel-intensive trawlers. Cost of diesel fuel oil rose at
least four-fold as did that of most of the petroleum based fishing gear (nets,
ropes, floats). Consequently, the number of fishing vessels financed
totalled only 35, of which 23 were trawlers and 12 were purse seiners as
compared to the appraisal estimate of 60 trawlers. A further consequence
was a marked departure from appraisal guidelines in the matter of vessel
construction and design. W4hile the original plan was to finance the
construction of 15 steel vessels and 45 wooden vessels, all the vessels
financed had wooden hulls. Steel vessels were no longer financially and
economically viable. The decision to use only wooden hulls was made on the
recommendation of the marine consultants.
3.03      The Bank appraisal report envisioned capacities to be 70 GT for
wooden vessels and 130 GT for steel vessels. The wooden vessels actually
financed had, however, varying capacities, ranging from 72 to 175 GT, but all
except six vessels were 72 to 100 GT in size. Choice of size was dictated
largely by experience and the subborrowers' expectations of potential catch in
the proposed fishing grounds. However, the vessel sizes were also affected by
increasing shortage of suitable lumber, whose price doubled between 1974 and
1976. Moreover, construction of vessels was often delayed by the relative



- 27 -
inexperience of local boat builders /1 with the non-traditional design and
specifications prescribed by the project consultants. Construction delays
resulted in further escalation of vessel construction costs, which would have
had a serious impact on proponents' liquidity position and on their eventual
loan repayment performance.
3.04      The continuing escalation of petroleum prices had its greatest
impact on trawl fishing, which was the main fishing method envisaged at the
time of appraisal. By its very nature, trawl fishing is highly fuel
intensive. By 1979 fuel oil costs accounted for an estimated 55% of trawler
operating costs, thus cutting deeply into the viability of trawl fishing as
compared to purse seine fishing. Loan demand for purse seine fishing vessels
resulted in the financing of 12 purse seiners under the project.
3.05      In addition, escalating operating costs tended to limit vessel
operations to nearby, heavily exploited fishing grounds and decrease the
number of fishing days, so that the reported incremental production did not
attain appraisal estimates.   A DBP survey of 16 vessels in 1977-78 established
that trawlers fished only 215 days, about 80% of DBP projections, while purse
seiners fished 218 days, also about 80% of DBP projections. Unfavorable
weather, the violation of restrictions on fishing on some traditional fishing
grounds in the Samar Sea, which resulted in the impounding of some vessels,
and long periods spent in dry dock for repairs and outfitting, were cited as
some of the factors affecting the number of fishing days.
3.06      Fish Carriers.   No second-hand carrier vessels were acquired under
the project. This was due partly to the fact that the international market
for used fishing vessels improved because of the high cost of steel.
Secondly, a number of proposals were examined for the acquisition of carrier
vessels, but most of them failed to meet the project requirements.     Thirdly,
the procurement procedures under the project were too slow to permit procure-
ment of desirable used fishing vessels which were rapidly bid for by venture
capital.
3.07      Ice-Plants.   Only one plant of ten ton capacity (as against three
of 30 ton capacity provided for in the project) was financed. The appraisal
expectation of a plant with a 30 ton capacity did not materialize because the
ice-plant requirement in the project area was in the meantime financed by
private capital. The project financed ice-plant was not completed due to
difficulties encountered by DBP's client in procuring the necessary machinery
and equipment. Building construction was also hampered by typhoons. DBP also
noted that their clients could obtain better terms under the Small and Medium
Industry Development Project (Loan 1120-PH), which discouraged further loan
demand.
/1 Although inexperienced, the yards had a substantial cost advantage because
of their low operating cost and overheads.



- 28 -
3.08      Slipways.   A number of slipway proposals were examined by DBP but
only one was financed.   Financing was provided for water depth surveys,
installation of machine shops and equipment. The yard handled fishing vessel
repairs and has helped in the construction of some of the project vessels. It
appeared to be well managed but was operating at only 50-60 percent capacity
at the time of the PCR mission's visit. The sharp rise in vessel operating
costs has also adversely affected the demand for slipway services.
3.09      Modernization of Vessels.    A number of loan applications were
examined, but none were approved. The view held by DPP's consultants was that
vessel improvement was impractical in light of the generally low standard of
hull conditions of eligible vessels, as the type of modernization envisaged
was main engine replacement. It appeared that an entirely new vessel would in
most cases cost only slightly more than merely re-engining an old vessel. In
addition, the project envisaged the replacement of obsolete machinery, such as
net drums, winches, power blocks, generators and transmissions, and the
addition of equipment such as short-wave radios, echo-sounders and fish
finders, but, re-engining was not included in this component.
Inland Component
3.10      From the outset, the lending for the inland sector maintained a
fairly rapid pace. As of June 30, 1979, the inland fisheries component
accounted for an aggregate of 698 subloans,/1 covering a total fishpond area
of about 13,000 ha. At appraisal about 12,000 ha of brackish water ponds were
projected for financing. None of the projected 100 ha of fresh water ponds
were financed. A comparison of appraisal estimate with actual results is
shown in Table 3.1.
3.11      The total cost of development and rehabilitation of the fishponds
financed by DBP, which came to P 76.0 million, exceeded the appraisal target
of P 59.9 million by 27%. Thus the average development cost per ha of
development was about P 6,000 against that projected at appraisal of
P 2,000 per ha for pond rehabilitation and P 5,000 per ha for pond
improvement. In addition to inflation, the fact that 28% of the loans were
for new pond construction accounted for the higher development costs.
Table 3.2 shows the sizes of the fish farms financed by DBP.
3.12      It can be seen that 78% of the area developed belonged to fishpond
holdings of 20 ha and above. The average size of fishpond in the largest size
category (50 ha and above) was 79 ha. The distribution in Table 3.2 is
generally in line with the expectations at the time of project appraisal.
/1 Most subborrowers have two or more accounts: one at 12% p.a. for subloans
secured by real estate and one at 14% p.a. not so secured. DBP does not
keep records of the total number of borrowers.

3.13      In early 1978 DBP conducted a sample study of the fishponds financed
up to the end of 1977.   The main findings of the survey were that: (a) pro-
duction per ha averaged 1,900 kg/ha/year, considerably higher than the
national average of about 600 kg/ha/year; (b) fishponds of 20-50 ha in size
showed the highest yield per ha among the different size groupings, and
rehabilitated ponds showed a higher yield per ha than new ponds; (c) owner-
operated ponds exhibited higher yields than those which were managed by hired
caretakers; and (d) formal training of pond operators, provision of technical
assistance, and the application of advanced cultural techniques (fertilizer,
supplemental feed and/or pesticides) all resulted in higher yields.
3.14      As a result of project concentration on pond rehabilitation and
improvement, as well as on ponds of 20 ha and above, production results as
compared to appraisal objectives were satisfactory.   Most fishponds reached
full production much earlier than the projected four years.    (Incremental
production is discussed in Chapter 5.)
Technical Assistance and Training
3.15      Two expatriate marine consultants (para. 2.09) provided by bilateral
assistance from the British Government were appointed under the project to
prepare boat designs and give technical advice to DBP. In the early stages of
project implementation it became apparent that due to the continuing need to
strengthen DBP's technical and practical expertise the naval architect's
assignment had to be extended.
3.16      Generally, the terms of reference for the consultants were followed
and accomplished with favorable effect on DBP's broadening assimilation of
expertise in subloan appraisal and supervision of vessel construction.
Other Project Components
3.17      The project included two components to be carried out by BFAR: (a) a
test fishing program and (b) an inland fisheries training program. In the
test fishing program, three fishing vessels of BFAR conducted purse seining,
trawling and long-line cruises, primarily in experimental fishing in the
southern part of the Philippines. The contribution of this program was
disappointing because BFAR experienced considerable difficulties with the
operation of a relatively old research fleet. In the inland fisheries
training program, the Pond Fishery Extension and Training Group under BFAR's
direction conducted training courses and field extension service demonstra-
tions in five principal field extension units. This program has developed
into one of the best training programs of its kind in the region and has
produced a number of highly qualified extension personnel and teaching aides.
3.18      Consultants were retained by BFAR to carry out two studies: (a)
a Smallholder Fishpond Project Study; and (b) a Fish Mfarketing and Distri-
bution Study. The Smallholder Fishpond Project Study was conducted jointly by
Sinotech Engineering Consultants, Inc. of Taipei, Taiwan, and International
Engineering Co., Inc. of San Francisco, California, USA. The Smallholder



- 31 -
Study developed an "estate concept" for a scheme conceived by the Philippine
Government to develop large tracts of mangrove swampland (1,500 and 3,000 ha)
into fishpond estates. The estates were to be subdivided into hundreds of 3
to 5 ha plots farmed by local residents, most without previous fish farming
experience. The report of the consultants underlined the fact that the high
cost involved in building up the required infrastructure for the project
adversely affected its feasibility. To some extent the feasibility of the
project also suffered from the fact that the study focused on a remote and
inaccessible area in Mindanao.
3.19      The Fish Marketing and Distribution Study, was carried out by
Norconsult, A.S., Norway. Although the study did not lead to the preparation
of any specific projects for external financing, it presents a large body of
useful fisheries data and analyses which are believed to have been of value in
planning fisheries programs by BFAR.
3.20      The project brought about a number of important changes in terms of
organization, staffing and operating policies. These are described below.
3.21      Organization, Staffing and Training.    In 1973, the Agricultural
Projects Department consisted of only 28 professionals (of which 18 were at
headquarters) and a handful of support personnel; quite often the
professionals had to carry out extraneous tasks. Contact with the field was
limited. The department's five divisions worked along functional lines
(Appraisal, Supervision, Loans, Branches and Agencies, and Loan Releasing
and Records). The growing involvement of DBP in the fisheries subsector
during project implementation led to three important developments: (a) DBP
reorganized its agricultural lending by commodity groups, (b) strengthened
the Fisheries Group; and (c) established a Planning and Evaluation Group.
3.22      DBP Fisheries Group.   The project's major contribution has been in
building up the Fisheries Group, which started with a small nucleus of three
technical staff. At present it has a total of 33 staff in the marine section
and 44 in the inland section. The corresponding staff strength in the
branches is 36 and 62. The fisheries staff at Head office is divided into
three groups: (a) Fisheries Group for Metro M4anila operations, (b) Fisheries
Group in charge of branch operations, and (c) Foreshore Fisheries (head
office). The Foreshore Fisheries (head office) is mainly concerned with
supervision and collection of the Foreshore 'Selda' loans./I After
considerable delay in the recruitment of staff for the marine subsector,
caused by the absence of competitive salaries, the Fisheries Group has only
now all technical positions filled.
/1 About 65,000 of these socially oriented loans were made at Government's
behest. Their purpose was to finance motorization and fishing gear of the
municipal (artisanal) fishermen's bancas. These loans have since proved
largely uncollectable but Government recently set up a Trust Fund with DBP
from which DBP will be able to cover its losses. Method of establishing
losses still has to be worked out.



- 32 -
3.23      With the strengthening of head office, and recruitment of more
fisheries staff for branches, the latter are now in a position to handle the
loan cases on their own, thus reducing the subloan processing time.     The
Fisheries Group has done well in reorganizing itself in the inland sector and
developed a capable technical and financial staff who have been active in
investment counseling, loan preparation and appraisal and loan disbursement.
There appears to be a need, however, to strengthen the loan supervison
function in order to ensure closer technical involvement during subproject
execution and to enable DBP to measure subborrower performance.
3.24      Training.   The training program was planned and executed as
envisaged at project appraisal. BFAP provided the requisite senior
extension staff to assist in training BFAR and DBP's appraisal staff in the
inland fisheries sector. Nearly 110 trainees received training over the
years 1973-77. A limited number received more formal training in the
University of the Philippines (College of Fisheries, Inland Fisheries
Project) at Los Banos and Iloilo City. Fellowship grants were awarded to
two staff members of the Fisheries Group in the field of marine fisheries,
undertaken in the United Kingdom, each for a period of three months. The
Assistant Manager of the Fisheries Group participated in a UNDP/FAO sponsored
training course on the management of small-scale fishery enterprises.
Another senior staff of the Group attended a session of the Indo-Pacific
Fisheries Council on inland fisheries held in Sri Lanka.
3.25      Loan Processing.   Compared to lending in other sectors subloan
processing under the project was slow. This can be explained by slowly
developing administrative procedures, establishment of additional branches
and the lack of supporting administrative staff. A closely related develop-
ment which placed additional demands on DBP's limited staff was a number of
government-initiated socially oriented agricultural programs (para. 3.27).
This involvement in large numbers of small loans reduced DBP's normal lending
activities. As a result lending under the project came largely to a halt
during this period. The Selda program was phased out during late 1976 when
normal lending operations were resumed. Another activity undertaken on a
massive scale which affected the progress of the project was an overall review
of the DBP loan portfolio in 1977, including evaluation of collateral values,
in order to determine an appropriate provision for insufficiently covered
loans.
3.26      Subloan Recording.   DBP's centralized financial recording system is
based on six-monthly updating of branch accounts by the head office computer.
The final computer print-out depends therefore on the accuracy of the
information supplied by each branch. While the controls over the financial
status of the many thousands of individual branch accounts are satisfactory,
the system is not able to accurately determine under which project individual
subloans are made. Thus for instance it cannot be reliably determined whether
each branch correctly designates subloans as originating under this or any
other ongoing program. Conscious of this weakness DBP established a separate,
manual reporting system for the branches to meet the World Bank reporting
requirements. This represents a duplication and, in any case, the two sets of



- 33 -
resulting figures have proved to be irreconcilable.     The Third Livestock and
Fisheries Project, negotiated in June 1980, provides funds for a consultancy
to design and introduce a new management information system to remedy this and
other weaknesses relating to controls over specific projects and programs. In
the meantime the Bank has agreed to wave quarterly reporting in favor of
semi-annual reports.
3.27      Portfolio Quality.   As of June 30, 1979 the past dues as percentage
of loans outstanding stood at 17.3%. Although this is better than for
instance all DBP's agricultural projects combined (39.3%) and the Bank-
financed Livestock I (25.2%), there is room for substantial improvement which
DBP hopes to achieve through its current strategy. This requires each Branch
Manager to review the status of each agricultural program to determine, in
conjunction with his Regional Manager, actions to be taken and the assistance
needed from the head office in this regard. The emphasis is on selectivity
under specific programs and concentration on arrears where amounts are
substantial and the loans are older, rather than tackling the entire agri-
cultural portfolio, including the numerous socially oriented and largely
uncollectable subloans made at government's behest. A new group, consisting
of ten senior staff has been established at the head office (Arrears Task
Force of the Branches and Agencies Department) oversees this operation and
makes recommendations on further actions.
3.28      Detailed review of the various aspects of the Fisheries I arrears is
given in Annex 2, Tables 1-4. The tables present the Fisheries I subloan
situation as of June 30, 1979 and the main conclusions are summarized below
in paras. 3.29 through 3.33.
3.29      By size of loan the heaviest concentration is in the P 100,000
to P 250,000 and P 250,000 to P 500,000 loan categories at the head
office and the branches; the concentration of proportionately the highest
arrears is similarly distributed, with the branches, however, showing more
arrears in the P 100,000 to P 250,000 category.
3.30      By age of arrears the head office (branches in brackets) shows 53%
(46%) of all loans to be up to date, 25% (22%) less than one year overdue,
with the balance of 22% (32%) distributed over 2 to 3 years of age.
3.31      By location and amount outstanding the Visayas represent the largest
investment (P 45.8 million and P 8.7 million for Western and Eastern
Visayas respectively), followed by Southern Mindanao (P 11.7 million) and
Luzon (P 10.8 million). As percentage of the total portfolio of P 88.1
million the above represent 52.7%, 5.7%, 13.3% and 12.3% respectively.
3.32      By loan amortization period, 55% of the head office loans are annual
and the rest quarterly. In the branches, amortizations are more widely
distributed: annual 55.9%, semi-annual 11.5% quarterly 29.6% and monthly
3.0%. In terms of arrears relating to the various amortization periods the
head office shows 68.0% relating to the annual repayments and 32.0% quartely.
In the branches these percentages in the order of amortizations mentioned



- 34 -
above is 56.1%, 6.3%, 32.9% and 4.6%. This gives an indication that the head
office annually amortized accounts perform worse than the quarterly accounts;
at the branches the semi-annual accounts perform the best. As the statistics
cannot be further disaggregated (fishponds, vessels, etc.) the use of this
analysis is limited to flagging issues for future examination by DBP.
3.33      Comparative analysis of the Fisheries I loans with DBP's total port-
folio and total agricultural portfolio shows that in the up-to-date category
Fisheries I with 47.0% is the best: total DBP 43.2%, total agriculture 29.8%.
Split into the global inland and marine subsectors, the inland (by age of
arrears) is somewhat better than the marine.
Lending Policies and Procedures
3.34      DBP's Loan Conditions.   DBP generally followed the suggestions made
at the time of appraisal and loan negotiations. It made subloans on the
basis of investment proposal evaluations by Fisheries Group appraisal staff
and in the case of the marine fisheries sector, recommendations by the marine
specialists as to their technical, financial and economic feasibility.
Evaluation of subloans included an examination of management capability and
experience. Loan disbursement was, as far as possible, made directly to
suppliers, manufacturers and contractors.
3.35      Collateral.   At the time of loan appraisal it was clear that to
expand the credit program in the fisheries sector, DBP would have to re-orient
its collateral requirements towards a more project-oriented lending policy
based on thorough technical, financial and economic evaluation of investment
projects.   This expectation has been fully realized.   DBP waived standing
requirements regarding real security to comply with the project's legal
covenants and made loans for acquisition of fishing boats on the security of
the boat itself, in the hope that captains and other crew would singly or
jointly acquire fishing boats as anticipated at appraisal. This expectation
was not realized, and DBP subsequently /1 altered the collateral requirement
to require at least 25% in the form of real estate. In the case of inland
fisheries, the assignment of the leasehold rights together with the value of
permanent improvements constitute DBP's security for the loans.
Grace Period
3.36      At the time of appraisal it was envisaged that grace periods ranging
from 1 to 3 years would be granted by DBP to marine fisheries borrowers and 1
to 4 years for inland fisheries. The mission observed that while this
requirement was followed, adequate grace periods were not allowed in the case
of subloans for acquisition of fishing boats. Normally, DBP expected
repayment of principal to commence within 6 months of the completion of the
boat building process. The marine operators interviewed by the mission
stated that due to heavy expenses involved in the early stage of the vessel
/1 During implementation of the Second Fisheries Project.



- 35 -
operations, it was not practiable to start repayment of the principal so
early. This difficulty was further accentuated by the fact that most of the
borrowers were not availing themselves of any working capital loans for
covering their operating expenses, generally because they were either unable
or unwilling to offer a real estate collateral, a standard DBP requirement.
DBP should reconsider its future policy in this regard. The total period
allowed for the repayment of subloans was along the lines envisaged during
appraisal and was generally considered adequate by most subborrowers.
Repayment periods were 4-10 years for marine subloans, and 5-12 years for
inland subloans.
3.37      Seasonality Pattern.   It appears that in some cases the amortization
schedule for repayment of the principal amount of the fishpond operations did
not adequately provide for seasonal production patterns. DBP at head office
has since amended its procedure and it now fixes the schedule after
development work on a fishpond has been completed and a clear picture of the
production cycle of the proponent can be envisaged.
3.38      Collection of Accrued Interest.    The practice followed by DBP during
the period of implementation of the project was that, while making the second
and subsequent progressive disbursements, accrued interest on prior disburse-
ment was deducted from the amount being released. This resulted in the
borrowers receiving a smaller amount than budgeted to carry out the agreed
investment and at times led to the clients' failure to complete the planned
job or forcing them to raise funds from other, more expensive sources. This
practice caused particular difficulty for new subprojects (as against
incremental projects) in which very little or no surplus income was generated
in the early period, with some defaults resulting in this account.
3.39      Penalty Rate of Interest.    During the later part of the execution of
this project, loan amounts past due for more than 60 days were subject:
(a) to an additional interest on the basic loan interest rate, and (b) a
penalty charge of 36% per annum./l This led to a rapid build up of heavy loan
arrears which in many cases were beyond the borrower's capacity to repay. In
early 1979 the Bank agreed to a reduction of the charge to 8% per annum for
loans up to P 3 million, and 16% for loans above P 3 million. However,
the grace period was reduced from 60 to 30 days and it was stipulated that
only accounts with all arrears paid within six months from April 2, 1979 would
benefit from this amendment. As a result, not many clients were able to
benefit from this reduction. The additional interest and the penalty charge
at 36% p.a. continues to inflate the past dues of the clients and repayments,
if any, made by them go only to reduce these additional charges, leaving the
principal and interest on the account unchanged. The mission considers that
/1 The penalty charge at this high rate was introduced under the Bank
financed Second Industrial Loan (1190-PH) signed in 1976, to block the
possible diversion of funds by DBP clients into the money market, where
shortage of domestic funds had pushed short-term rates well beyond 25%.



- 36 -
it would be more equitable to apply the lower rates to the current arrears as
well.
3.40      Pre-operating Costs and Contingencies.    While drawing up the sub-
project development budgets at the time of subloan appraisal, no provision was
made for pre-operating costs and contingencies to cover cost overruns due to
price escalations or unforeseen losses. This led some clients to raise
supplementary loans from other sources at a higher cost. This has indirectly
affected DBP loan recoveries as the surplus funds generated by the project go
first towards repayment of the higher cost borrowings. Standard marine
insurance is required in the case of loans for fishing vessels. To strengthen
its ability to collect repayments in cases of failure for whatever reason, DBP
is currently considering introduction of a repayment guarantee scheme similar
to the guarantee coverage under the CB/IBRD Fourth Rural Credit Project (Loan
1399-PH) under which the financial institution is covered up to 80% of the
unsecured portion of medium and long-term loans. In the case of calamities
DBP provides special assistance by additional (emergency) loans and
restructuring of existing loans.
3.41      Supervision.   Supervision was usually limited to loan disbursements,
billing and account collection, with intensive follow-up only on those
accounts which have been in default for some time. As a result, technical and
operational problems facing subprojects, particularly in the inland subsector,
remained unnoticed in the earlier stages. Supervision of vessel loans was
adequate during the vessel construction period, but ceased thereafter. A
number of marine subborrowers made this point to the mission and stressed the
need for continued assistance during the start-up period while familiarity was
being gained with new equipment and fishing techniques.
3.42      In response to the Bank's October 1977 agriculture Review Mission
DBP intensified its subloan supervision subsequent to the completion of loan
disbursements. At head office these efforts have been evident but the
branches, with the exception of those in Regions V and VI (where the staff of
BFAR are assisting) lack sufficient staff for this important activity. This
matter has been drawn to DBP management's attention by this the completion
mission.
3.43      Emergency Financing.   As fishponds in several areas of the
Philippines suffer almost regularly from calamities, arrangements for quick
financial assistance are essential. Standard arrangements for emergencies
were not available under Fisheries I, but subloans made under the Second
Fisheries Project provide in the subproject cost estimates 15% for price
escalations, and another 15% for unforeseen calamaties like floods, typhoons,
etc.
3.44      Subloan Restructuring.   DBP's policy is restrictive on the grounds
that a lenient posture would encourage borrowers' delinquency. Until recently
there was a requirement that at least 20% of the overdue principal and
interest must be repaid even by a calamity-affected client, before his debt is
rescheduled. Last year this limit was lowered to 5%, but it appears that not



- 37 -
many borrowers availed themselves of this facility and the requirement may
still be too severe.   The mission recommends that DBP should review its loan
restructuring policy and procedures to avoid hardships in those cases where
clients have genuine problems.
3.45      Insurance.   The mission observed that in the case of marine subloans
made by the Bacolod branch, the insurance coverage obtained for vessels
financed was inadequate in two respects. Firstly, the vessels were insured
only up to the amount of the DBP loan and not for their full cost or
replacement value. Secondly, in some cases the vessels were insured only
against total loss and not against partial damage. As a result, DBP's
collateral appeared inadequate in some cases. DBP's management is currently
looking into the matter.
Contribution of the Project to Agricultural Credit Resources
3.46      The Bank did not substitute for credit which would otherwise have
been available from other sources. Rural banks, private development banks,
the Philippine National Bank and DBP would not have financed project benefi-
ciaries because of: (a) leasehold properties were not acceptable as
collateral, and a policy of not financing incremental operating expenses
(rural banks); (b) limitations on repayment periods (PDBs); (c) financing only
short-term lending (PNB); and (d) limited funding (DBP). The loan was,
therefore, instrumental in channeling additional funds to the credit system
and in satisfying the substantial needs of medium-sized operators for
long-term purposes.
Refinancing of Working Capital Loans
3.47       Financing arrangements for this project had envisaged that
incremental working capital would be provided partly by subborrowers and,
if not available from other sources, partly by DBP.     In practice, in the
case of loans for the rehabilitation and development of fishponds the
incremental working capital needs of a subproject were built into its budget
and DBP financed 85 to 95% of the subproject cost. In the case of marine
subloans, however, a separate working capital loan was provided if the
borrower could provide additional collateral.
3.48      It appears that the working capital loans were administratively
isolated in the case of marine vessels, but not clearly identified in the
case of fishponds. The mission was unable therefore to acertain whether past
claims for reimbursement had included incremental working capital loans for
fishpond operators. Records of many of the lending branches are involved and
it is doubtful whether at this late stage the time and effort required to
reassemble and review all the records is warranted. However, this does
clearly indicate that arrangements for disbursing against statements of
expenditures need to establish more formal procedure for audit by the Bank,
particularly in those cases where extensive consolidations of branch figures
are undertaken.



- 38 -
Procurement
3.49      Fishing vessels of the sizes envisaged by the project are normally
constructed by small contractors to whom the owner supplies all materials.
These are small "beach operations" and consequently competitive bidding by
local boat builders as stipulated in the Loan Agreement was not feasible. The
Bank agreed subsequently to owner-supervised procurement under the general
guidance of DBP. In March 1977, however, in response to suggestions that boat
prices under owner-supervised procurement had been artificially inflated, DBP
reverted to competitive bidding. The expectation was that the tax advantages
on imported boat components enjoyed by the prequalified boat builders would
enable them to supply boats at relatively lower prices than owner-procured
boats. However, it was found that the prequalification requirements for boat
yards tended to exclude the smaller boat yards, set up in response to
opportunities provided under the loan, thereby causing a decline in local
employment opportunities. Further, the boat yards capable of submitting bids
tended to be relatively over-capitalized, resulting in a higher unit cost. On
June 10, 1977, the first competitive bidding was conducted for two fishing
boats. A technical committee consisting of DBP staff and a consultant was set
up to evaluate the bids received. A comparative analysis of the cost of the
vessels financed under the previous (owner-procured) procedure and the lowest
bid received in the first competitive bidding showed that the latter was 8%
higher. Subsequently, DBP reverted to the old procedure for all but the
larger vessels.
3.50      Quotations for imported vessel equipment were obtained through
international advertisement and qualified suppliers were evaluated according
to responses received. Equipment items specified by beneficiaries were
ordered through DBP and installed at local shipyards. Procurement of
second-hand fish carriers outside the Philippines through international
competitive bidding was found infeasible and no carriers were acquired under
the project (para. 3.06). DBP's experience with international competitive
bidding for ice-making and slipway facilities was that the scale of investment
in these components was too small for this mode of procurement, and
additionally too small to support the Bank- required consultants for facility
design and project formulation (para. 3.07).
Cooperation with BFAR
3.51      From the inception of this project DBP was aware of the need to
strengthen its provision of technical assistance to its clients. Apart from
building up its own expertise, this was also to be achieved through a
cooperative arrangements with BFAR. These, however were not formalized
until early 1978, when DBP and BFAR signed an Agreement (Annex 3) under which
BFAR was to provide technical assistance to DBP's fishpond borrowers in
drawing up technical plans for fishpond development, supervising the
construction thereof, and conducting regular subproject visits. The Bicol and
Western Visayan regions were to serve as pilot areas for the cooperative
effort. However, due to other pressing BFAR activities, full implementation



- 39 -
of the Agreement proved difficult for BFAR./1 The basic constraints include
the following factors: BFAR extension staff assigned to work with DBP have
remained under the administrative control of BFAR, and as such are not
answerable to the DBP Branch Manager; BFAR staff, whose salaries are below
those of equivalent DBP staff, have not been given any financial incentive for
the added responsibility of intensive supervision over DBP's fishpond clients;
the extension staff are not stationed in DBP's branch offices./2 There is a
need for a joint review of the standing arrangement by senior staff of DBP and
BFAR, which is expected be introduced by the Third Livestock and Fisheries
Credit Project.
3.52      There is also a need for extension of the scope of DBP/BFAR farmer-
related assistance to include examination of input supplies, the marketing
situation, recommendations on fishpond management techniques coupled with
financial, recording and reporting methodology (farm records). In this
context, the BFAR staff should contribute to the broadening of DBP's develop-
ment efforts, with the ultimate objective of improved subproject implemen-
tation and a concomitant improvement to DBP's loan portfolio quality. To
enhance the interaction between the field staff of DBP and BFAR, the duties
and responsibilities of each of the institutions will require more specific
definition than exists presently. Finally, in planning any training course, a
provision needs to be made for the BFAR supporting staff to undertake
familiarization and training in DBP's objectives, methods and procedures to
foster their more intensive participation and to broaden their perspective in
terms of the financial and economic implications of technical assistance to
farmers.
3.53      For marine fisheries, technical support was extended mainly by the
DBP's marine consultants, particularly in boat designing and construction.
DBP did not seek and BFAR did not extend on its own any assistance in this
field. Most of those marine proponents interviewed by the mission stressed
the need for technical assistance after the completion of vessel construction,
during the start-up period of vessel operations when new operators are gaining
familiarity with new vessels and equipment.
/1 For instance in Bacolod there appeared to have been no contact between
DBP and BFAR.
/2 The mission felt that DBP's head office should review more frequently
various Branch Managers' cooperation with local BFAR staff.

4. SPECIFIC PROJECT ELEMENTS
Disbursements
4.01      Cumulative disbursements compared to appraisal estimates were as
follows:
FY       1974    1975    1976     1977    1978     1979
-------------- (US$ million) --------------

As shown above, the disbursements were ahead of schedule in 1974-75, espe-
cially in the latter year. Increased discretionary lending authority granted
branch managers, and the increases in the number of DBP branches and staff
involved contributed to accelerated disbursements in 1976 and particularly
1977, when disbursements exceeded the planned level. Shortfalls in 1975, 1976
and 1978 were due primarily to the fact that applications for Bank reimburse-
ments were made much later than field loan releases, due to slow branch
reporting to headquarters. The loan was fully disbursed by August 1979, about
two months after Closing Date.
Reallocation of Funds
4.02      At DBP's request, the Bank loan funds were reallocated in October
1976 so as to transfer the entire provision under the "Unallocated" head to
"Inland Fisheries," as subloan demand was strong. On final disbursement on
August 23, 1979, further reallocation of unutilized "Consultant's" funds was
took place.

Fulfillment of the Main Loan Covenants
4.03      Annex 5 reviews the compliance with various loan covenants.
Briefly, the Government and DBP generally complied with the loan agreement
except for the delay in (i) initiating a monitoring system and (ii) in under-
taking a meaningful review of the project's loan portfolio. In July 1979 DBP
made a start with a Monitoring and Evaluation Survey under the Second
Livestock Project (Loan 1225-PH) with the assistance of local consultants.
The survey is to be broadened to include fisheries and other agricultural
projects when fully developed. Its continuation will be financed under the
Third Livestock and Fisheries Credit Project. It must be added that DBP
undertook various ad hoc studies under Fisheries I but, except for preparing a
basic document for this completion report, did not in fact create a coherent
monitoring function responsive to the loan covenant. As for the fisheries
portfolio review, DBP conducted a survey in 1978 as part of its general
portfolio review. DBP staff is currently supervising the fisheries operators
having difficulties quite intensively on an individual basis to determine if
there is a need to restructure the subloan or to institute coercive legal
steps.
5. PROJECT FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT
Project Output and Costs
5.01      A summary of the number of units financed by the project and their
total cost, as well as appraisal estimates, are shown in Table 5.1. About
13,000 ha were financed for brackish water fishpond development; this
slightly exceeded planned brackish water pond hectarage, but total projected
inland component costs at about P 76 million exceeded appraisal estimates
by 26%. A total of 35 wooden-hulled fishing vessels were financed at a
total cost of about P 55.4 million, 42% less than the estimated number of
new fishing vessels but 54% above the estimated costs at appraisal.
5.02      Inland Component.   As shown in Table 5.1 of the about 13,000 ha of
brackish water fishponds financed, an estimated 6,800 ha, or 53%, were for
pond rehabilitation; 2,400 ha (19%) for pond improvements, and 3,600 ha
(28%) for new fishponds funded. Most (88%) of the financed pond hectarage
was in Luzon and the Visayas. Over 1,800 ha were financed in Mindanao.
Ponds financed averaged 21 ha, and 56% of the loans - accounting for 91% of
total hectarage - were made to farms of 10 ha or larger (see para. 3.13).
5.03      Table 5.2 shows a comparison between project unit costs and output
at appraisal compared with actual operating results as of January 1980. For
comparable components financed by unit: (a) costs for brackish water fish-
ponds were 24% higher than appraisal estimates, and production was 58% higher;
(b) costs for wooden fishing vessels were almost 400% higher and production
was slightly lower (8%). The enormous cost increase in the marine component
is attributable to the steep cost escalations resulting from a continuous
series of oil price increases. Wholesale and retail price indices 1972-78
are shown in Annex 3, Table 1.

Performance of Subborrowers
5.04      Inland Component. Gaining a clear picture of the results and
performance of fishpond subborrowers is difficult due to the diversity in the
characteristics of ponds financed. Differences in pond location, size, type
and stage of development, management, and culture techniques, all affect pond
productivity, operational costs and income. Annex 3, Table 3 summarizes data
describing pond production per hectare, as determined by the DBP random survey
in 1977/78 of 64 subborrowers' accounts. The table clearly shows the gains to
production realized from pond rehabilitation, optimum size (about 25 ha),
management experience, extension assistance, and selected use of inputs; all
these factors raise production from low levels of about 800 kg/ha/yr to levels
of up to 3,100 kg/ha/yr with an average of about 1,900 kg/hr/yr.
5.05      A measure of the financial performance of the average 15 ha fishpond
financed by the project during its first two years of operation, as well as a
revised projection of its future operations, is provided in the cash flow
analyses (Annex 3, Tables 5, 6 and 7). These analyses reveal revised FRRs of
29% for new pond development, 36% for pond improvement, and 59% for pond
rehabilitation. These rates are higher than those projected of 10 ha: as
shown in Annex 3, Table 4 subborrowers achieved higher production on the
average than that projected at appraisal and due to the marked changes in
absolute and relative prices for key inputs and for milkfish, which have
occurred since appraisal. They also achieved higher average profitability.
As indicated in Annex 3, Table 1, ex-farm prices for milkfish more than
doubled between 1972 and 1978, while prices for the major elements of pond
operating costs - labor, fertilizer and fry appear to have increased by a
smaller amount.
5.06      DBP financed 35 vessels under the Project and as of June 30, 1978
26 were operating (Annex 3, Table 10). Two vessels were not completed by the
subborrower and three had sunk. Annex 3, Table 12 compares appraisal
production estimates with data on 16 project vessels compiled by DBP for 1977,
as well as with Bank estimates for 1978/79.    On the average the 16 vessels
surveyed performed about as well as expected at appraisal although the data
should be interpreted with care.    The number of fishing days of project
vessels (215-218) was lower than expected at appraisal (270) and the survey
results show catch performance to be about those expected at appraisal (about
1.5 tons/day), but accurate operating results from specific borrowers to
provide such data is extraordinarily difficult to obtain because of the
reluctance of fishermen, captains, and owners to reveal actual catch infor-
mation which could be directly related to financial performance, ability to
repay and income tax obligations. Actual catch for most project vessels in
service is regarded as higher than appraisal estimates. Knowledgeable
industry sources (not subborrowers of DBP) generally regard catch rates of the
order shown in Annex 3, Table 12 as reasonable for the sizes of vessels
financed (shown in Annex 3, Table 10).
5.07      The underlying reasons for the generally poor reported performance
and repayment record of financed vessels are complex. Some problems commenced



- 45 -
during the construction phase in most cases. As can be seen from Annex 3,
Table 2, vessel construction ran in excess of 11 months for most vessels.
The construction periods both increased construction costs and reduced the
amount of loan funds available to beneficiaries - due to the DBP practice of
deducting interest on previous disbursements from subsequent disbursements.
The net result of these two factors was a reduction in subborrowers' cash
reserves. Commencing operations with reduced cash reserves, marine subbor-
rowers were immediately faced with high initial operating expenses to be
expected during the start-up stage of new vessel operations - as operators
attempted to familiarize themselves with new equipment, and with the addi-
tional demands of loan repayment (para. 3.33). This difficult situation was
often exacerbated by the relative inexperience of many subborrowers with
vessel management and operation. Further, most subborrowers did not possess a
large fleet of fishing vessels with which to offset losses by one or two
vessels.
5.08      Yet another element in this equation, driving up initial as well as
subsequent operating costs, was the very sharp increase in diesel fuel oil
prices (Annex 3, Table 1) and the larger than anticipated crew complements
(Annex 3, Table 12). Fuel costs alone were estimated by Fisheries Industry
Development Council (FIDC) to comprise an average of 45% and 55% of total
operating costs of purse-seiners and trawlers, respectively. Primarily as a
result of escalating diesel oil prices, vessel operators, after some
exploration of nontraditional fishing grounds, confined their fishing
activities to closer traditional grounds and limited the number of fishing
days. These actions appear to have reduced reported vessel productivity and
income./I There is some evidence of declining catch-per-effort in traditional
waters (about 1%-2%/yr decline) in recent years, particularly in those around
the Visayas where nearly all financed vessels operate (see Map). Vessel
operators also claimed that unfavorable weather, restrictions on some
traditional fishing grounds and long periods taken up by repairs also reduced
the number of fishing days.
5.09      The net result of the various factors discussed above was that, in
spite of a 150% increase in wholesale prices for marine fish between 1972 and
1978 (Annex 3, Table 1), vessel operators were caught in a squeeze between
somewhat lower revenues and higher operating costs. The effect of these two
forces is difficult to evaluate as available operational data is not con-
sidered sufficiently reliable, although cash flow analyses it should have been
possible for subborrowers to service their loans. The revised FRR for an
average trawler is in line with the 25% projected at appraisal; the FRR for an
average purse seiner is higher than that for a trawler, because of the greater
productivity and lower operating costs of a purse-seiner.
/1 Many subborrowers had little or no experience in the fishing industry but
they had highly experienced captains and fishermen as operators. This may
have led to a source of systematic catch underreporting,a prevalent
practice in many such situations in many different fisheries.



- 46 -
5.10      The problems of marine subborrowers discussed above may or may not
account for the fact that as many as 23 of 31 subborrowers were in arrears on
their repayments. The picture is far from clear, but there is a real possi-
bility that all vessel revenues are not reaching some subborrowers. Two
subborrowers complained to the mission of surreptitious sales by their crews.
Another operator described putting into place a complex checking system to
prevent such practices.
Project Impact
5.11      The project met with some success in addressing its broad objectives
of assisting the government's strategy of increasing fish production for
domestic consumption, and reducing constraints hampering long-term development
of the fisheries sector, but fell short of total production objectives,
particularly in the marine component.
5.12      Direct Effects.   The direct effects of the project can be seen in
the vessels constructed, pond hectarage improved, rehabilitated and brought
under milkfish cultivation, slipways upgraded, incremental fish production,
and expanded employment. Over 12,700 ha of fishponds were rehabilitated,
improved or brought under cultivation by the project, 7% above the appraisal
objective of 11,900 ha of brackish water pond area (Table 3.1, para. 3.10).
5.13      A total of 35 new fishing vessels were financed, of a planned
60 vessels. Twenty-six of these were operating at the time of the mission's
visit (para. 5.06). Except for two vessels, which were constructed and are
based in Navotas, all the vessels were constructed and are based in the
Visayas. One of two planned slipways was financed. One of three planned new
ice-plants was financed. None of the ten planned second-hand fish carrier
vessels were acquired (para. 3.06) or the 100-plus vessel improvements
financed (para. 3.09).
5.14      Estimated project incremental production in 1977 (year 4 of project
implementation) is summarized in Annex 3, Table 12. Because of the greater
than projected productivity and hectarage financed, incremental production in
the inland component, at an estimated 19,100 tons, exceeds the volume of
annual incremental production projected at appraisal by 229%. Besides the
factors mentioned above, the preponderence of larger and rehabilitated ponds
among those financed (over 50% of the total accounts) was also an important
element in the margin of actual over appraisal estimates. The conservative
projection of pond productivity at appraisal was an additional factor. In the
marine component, estimated project incremental production in 1977, at 8,900
tons, was only 59% of the appraisal volume estimate.
5.15      Although detailed data describing the one financed slipway
improvement are not available, interviews with the manager of this operation
indicated the facility was operating at 50-60% of capacity. The manager
attributed this to escalating operating expenses, especially fuel, and the
resultant attempt by vessel operators to delay, forego or otherwise cut
corners in vessel maintenance.



- 47 -
5.16      Whether production of financed vessels represented incremental
production in the national context is not certain. Examination of Annex 1,
Table 1, reveals total Philippine commercial fisheries production increased
19,600 tons between 1975 and 1977 (the first project vessels came on stream in
1976). Annex 1, Table 2 shows, however, that total production by both
trawlers and purse-seiners of the 50-100 GT size range declined between 1975
and 1977. Further, total commercial landings in Navotas, Iloilo and Cebu also
declined during these same years; only landings in Bacolod showed a notable
increase. (Nearly all financed vessels land the bulk of their catches in
Bacolod, Iloilo, Roxas, Tacloban, Cebu and Navotas, and are in the 50-100 GT
size range.) Thus it appears that actual project incremental production in
the national context may have been even less than 8,900 tons in 1977. As
project vessels primarily exploited heavily fished Visayan fishing grounds, it
is quite possible that stable or only slightly increased catches on these
grounds were merely distributed among a greater number of vessels. Data
describing the total numbers of commercial fishing vessels in the Philippines
(Annex 1, Table 2) appears to contradict this conclusion, however. These data
show the numbers of both 50-100 GT trawlers and purse-seiners declining
between 1975 and 1977. But it must be remembered that these are national
data; similar data covering only Visayan ports are not available.
5.17      Overall project economic rate of return was estimated at appraisal
at 34%. Due to the lack of information on the number of units coming on
stream each year, computation of a reasonable estimate of project ERR was not
possible but achievement of this rate is very likely. The revised financial
rates of return for the three main types of fishponds have been computed, and
are provided in Annex 3, Tables 5, 6 and 7. These rates are: new pond
construction 29%, improved ponds 36%, pond rehabilitation 59%. Annex 3 Tables
8 through 16 shows a similar series of financial and economic analyses for a
15 ha fishpond, also based on 1979 prices, prepared for the Third Livestock
and Fisheries Credit Project. The four stages examined were: new
construction, major reconstruction, partial reconstruction and minor
rehabilitation. The corresponding FRRs and ERRs in that sequence are 27%,
23%, 18%, 41% and 43%, 33%, 26%, 53%. A typical 75 GT vessel (Annex 3, Table
17) shows financial and economic rates of return of 22% and 28% respectively.
Insufficient data was available to provide separate returns for trawling and
purse seining.
5.18      Another direct effect of the project was on employment:     permanent
employment on financed vessels, fishponds and the slipway, and temporary
employment for vessel, slipway and fishpond construction. Total employment
generated by each of these elements are estimated in Table 5.3. In the
marine component, permanent employment, at 600 jobs, was less than that
projected at appraisal, but higher than one would expect comparing only the
number of vessels planned (60) with the number in operation in 1977 (25).
Actual permanent employment generated by new vessels was relatively high due
to the financing of purse seiners, each of which carries a crew of 30-35 men.
Crews of only 15 men were projected at appraisal. Estimated temporary
employment actually generated by the marine component was less than half that
projected at appraisal, but in line with expectations in that only slightly



- 48 -
more than half of the number of planned bessels were financed.     In the inland
component, both permanent and temporary employment actually generated was less
than appraisal estimates due to the increase in labor costs. DBP postulates
that a greater proportion of labor than was originally estimated was and is
being done by formerly under- and unemployed family members, because of
escalating wage rates.

5.19      Secondary Effects.   Secondary effects of the project on the
Philippine economy, while difficult to quantify, should not be overlooked.
These effects were a product of the direct effects discussed above, the
feasibility studies financed by the project, the assistance provided BFAR
and DBP by the project for training purposes as well as institutional
improvements (in the case of DBP), and BFAR's test fishing program.



- 49 -
5.20      In the fishpond sector, but particularly the marine sector, the
project introduced or helped disseminate innovations in fishing techniques
and technology. Project vessels, of greater beam and depth in relation to
length than traditional vessels, have better sea keeping qualities, better
stability, and greater carrying capacity than vessels of traditional design.
New vessel construction techniques are being assimilated by local boat
builders, although vessel construction quality must continue to be improved.
The advantages of the vessels financed by the project are being recognized
by vessel operators in spite of their apparently poor financial performance.
Similarly, vessel operators' acceptance of the advantages of more sophis-
ticated electronic equipment (such as echo sounders and fish finders) and
fishing gear (such as power blocks) has been speeded up by the use of this
equipment on many project vessels. In the fishpond sector, industry
acceptance of the advantages of formation ponds has been speeded up as a
result of the experience of project beneficiaries.
5.21      The BFAR test fishing program, as well as the initial fishing
operations of some financed vessels, contributed to a better knowledge of
previously under- and unexploited fishing grounds. The dividends of these
activities will be a measure of relief to heavily exploited traditional
fishing grounds and increased future production.
5.22      The feasibility studies financed by the project, while not result-
ing immediately in projects suitable for external financing, have already
borne some secondary fruits, in that the Fish Marketing and Distribution
Study was utilized in the Government's planning of five new fishing ports.
5.23      The training provided to key BFAR extension personnel and DBP tech-
nicians by the project represents another contribution of the project to the
industry's long-term development.
6. BANK PERFORMANCE
6.01      The Bank's performance has been analyzed at the three phases of the
project: (a) during preparation; (b) at appraisal and negotiations; and (c)
during implementation.
6.02      During Preparation.   Bank performance was good in defining the
problems and in orienting the project towards their solution. A major deci-
sion to select DBP as the on-lending agency proved crucial to the success of
the project; the other possible choice was the rural bank structure.
Experience with the series of rural credit projects financed through the
Central Bank of the Philippines shows that subloans for fisheries did not move
well through this credit structure.
6.03      At Appraisal and Negotiations.    Additional improvements in project
design were made, including emphasizing lending to smallholders, establishing
the Fisheries Group in the Agricultural Projects Department of DBP, appointing



- 50 -
specialists, and providing for an appropriate training program. However, the
project design overlooked the need to assign a definitive role to BFAR.     The
project would have benefited from a closer tie-up such as was forged between
DBP and BFAR in September 1978. Closer collaboration between the two agencies
in the earlier stages would have enabled DBP's field staff to provide more
intensive and and more technically oriented supervision of the fishponds. On
the marine side cooperation between BFAR and DBP still needs to be developed.
6.04      Certain loan covenants proved to be difficult to comply with.     These
include international competitive bidding requirements for second-hand
carrier vessels (para. 3.06), and slipway and ice plant facilities (para. 3.07
and 3.08), as well as the Bank requirements for design consultants and
step-by-step Bank approval of slipway and ice-plant subloans.
6.05      During Implementation.   From the start the Bank continued to build
up a close relationship with DBP. It provided assistance to DBP and BFAR in
locating suitable consultants. Once the consultants were in position,
implementation began to move smoothly and there were no real problems in this
phase of the project. The choice of the consultants was sound and DBP
benefited from their advice in the early stages of project execution. The
Bank also showed flexibility in agreeing to raise the free limit for subloans
from US$250,000 to US$400,000.
6.06      The interval between the supervision visits was reasonable all
through the implementation period and the composition of the mission teams
quite appropriate in that in most of the full supervision missions a fisheries
expert was included. Reasonable continuity of Bank personnel was maintained
and the relationship between the Bank and DBP continued to be enhanced. This
cooperation established the basis for future institution building develop-
ments, particularly in the field of DBP's organizational structure,
improvement to DBP's management information system, gradual development of
monitoring of subprojects, resolution of procurement problems, emphasis on
reduction of loan arrears, and subloan appraisal and supervision techniques.
6.07      Given the constraints under which DBP was working, it is doubtful
whether the Bank should have been more forceful in requiring DBP and BFAR to
provide more technical assistance to subborrowers. However the Bank should
probably have been more insistent on DBP's engagement of monitoring
specialists to help in a field relatively new to DBP.
Lessons Learned
6.08      Marine Fisheries.   The lessons learned from the continuing cost
escalations after the 1973/74 oil crisis, the gradually declining catch per
unit of fishing effort and other developments described in this report are
best described in terms of current industry trends:
(a) shift in preference to smaller vessels;



- 51 -
(b) shift from trawling to purse seining, primarily because of fuel
saving;
(c) trend towards economies of scale in fleet management and saving in
transportation costs (carrier vessels);
(d) continuation of the development of the more distant fishing grounds
for domestic catch and growing fish supply to regional urban
centers; and
(e) growing importance in the catch of high value export species,
particularly tuna, brought about by technological changes in fishing
(floating rafts). This has both attracted new capital and caused a
shift in capital resources from the "domestic" fleet to the "tuna"
fleet.
6.09      Except for the tuna potential the industry's investment in new
vessels should now be limited in general to replacement of old and obsolete
vessels. The first and second projects correctly foresaw these trends by
providing finance for a wide range of vessel sizes (particularly with the
second project) and fish carriers. The latter were included in the first
project but it appears that DBP and its potential clients were not ready for
this subcomponent's fairly complicated Bank procurement procedures; under the
second project conversion of fishing boats into carriers was envisaged but
again this subcomponent did not attract subborrowers.
6.10      Any future project of this nature would benefit from the following
considerations:
(a) conditions relating to boat sizes and designs should be
flexible to allow some experienced subborrowers more leeway
to procure facilities for their unique requirements and to
allow for continuing changes in the industry;
(b) the project should include finance for fitting new equipment
(engines, hydraulic winches, radar, sonar) and so be more
responsive to subborrowers' needs, each of whom will have
requirements strictly applicable to his own enterprise; the
implication for DBP is to build up relevant expertise to meet these
demands;
(c) past performance of subloan applicants must be scrutinized very
closely: of particular importance will be applicants' experience in
the industry, organizing ability, management experience and finan-
cial background. This calls for a high degree of various skills and
experience which few new entrants would possess. Consequently this
component's success will depend not only on promotion by DBP but
also on its ability to respond to the industry's needs. Promotional
and technical assistance activities for DBP in the future should be
increasing at the lower end of the industry scale, the 12 GT fishing



- 52 -
vessels, and re-equipped traditional motorized canoe-type vessels
(bancas), as well as in promoting adoption of construction standards
and evaluating technical change;
(d) DBP should redeploy its staff to concentrate its marine lending
activities in the more remote regions to support the gradual shift
to fishing these waters, and to promote the introduction of lower
size vessels (12 GT and bancas); and
(e) volume of lending to fisheries enterprises supplying the domestic
market should be limited, so as not to exacerbate the declining
catch per effort, particularly in the traditional fishing areas near
Manila. On the other hand it is the mission's judgment that a
significant opportunity for lending exists in the financing of
small-scale tuna fishery for export. DBP should therefore examine
the possibility of redeploying its staff for closer involvement in
the financing of Ia wider range of fishing technologies.
6.11      Inland Fisheries.   There appears to have been no major sectoral
shift in this activity, which has suffered major cost escalation while the
value of the fish produced had shown a very small real price increase.      The
reduced profit margins focus on the importance of improving yields from
existing facilities through cost effective management. In this instance the
experience of the previous project is not as significant as the current
changes in the regulations governing the awarding of fishpond leases.
Recently introduced, they will enable conversion of one and ten year leases to
a term of 25 years, thus creating a better investment climate. Conditions of
these conversions have been liberalized and it can therefore be anticipated
that DBP will over the next two or three years be involved in financing a
substantial amount of incremental investments on low investment fishponds
established on leaseholds previously under short duration tenure status.
While Government is also moving in the direction of making a very limited
amount of additional mangrove areas available for new leases, investments in
new ponds will probably continue to be dampened by rising costs which make
construction, development and operation of new fishponds a very risky
proposition for the time being.
6.12       Institutional.  In future there will be a need to structure Bank
loans to allow both DBP and the Bank sufficient flexibility to respond to
changing circumstances during project implementation. This will require a
change in the relationships among the participating agencies and the Bank. In
particular, Bank supervision will need to focus on the project's response to
changing circumstances rather than reviewing implementation according to a
prescribed schedule.
Future Subsector Outlook
6.13      With the increasing cost of fuel and the gradual decline in catch
per unit of fishing effort in such traditional waters as Manila Bay, the
Visayan Sea and Sulu Sea, a shift in this subsector's mode of operation in



- 53 -
domestic waters is foreseen. Gear changes and vessel conversions, for
example, from trawling to purse seining have already been initiated by the
private sector; as have improvements in fleet management and market services.
MNR's Fisheries Industry Development Council (FIDC) is well placed to assist
in this transition. BFAR, however, will be concentrating its resources on
artisanal fisheries development, encouraging fisheries in traditional areas
with improved gear and basically traditional boats and small trawlers (12 GT).
The upgrading of some of the progressive artisanal fishermen to ownership of
such vessels is called for. Infrastructure development to support artisanal
fisheries especially to strengthen the market access is envisaged under the
National Fisheries Project, now under preparation.

PHILIPPINES
SECOND FISHERIES CREDIT PROJECT (LOAN 1270-PH)
OVERVIEW ON PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
1.        The Project Completion Report, prepared by staff of the Development
Bank of the Philippines (DBP), is well done and self-critical, although it was
submitted far later than scheduled. Except for information exclusively held
in the Bank files and unavailable in DBP, the report covers all salient
information and, except where indicated otherwise, provides a full statement
and interpretation of events. The information in this overview reflects
information in the PCR and the Bank files and, where appropriate includes Bank
comments on conclusions of the PCR.
2.        The project is a continuation of the First Fisheries Credit Project
(891-PH) and a predecessor to a combined livestock and fisheries credit
project (1894-PH), which is now about 30% disbursed. Loan 1270-PH is a
project with no norr-credit components, although it is important to note the
technical assistance provided under 891-PH continued through July 1977; i.e.,
through the very early stages of the project. Specifically, the project
sought to develop both inland and marine fisheries in support of the
Government's effort to attain self sufficiency in fish and to continue
institutional support of DBP as a lender for fisheries investment. At full
development it was anticipated that 15,000 additional tons of milkfish would
be produced in project fishponds and project vessels would catch an additional
10,000 tons of marine species.
Project Achievements
3.        In terms of loan approvals the project exceeded appraisal estimates
by a considerable margin. As is to be expected in a credit project, not
all investments made were precisely what had been expected at appraisal
(Table 1.1). In terms of output of fish, at least at the time data were
gathered for the PCR, production tonnage was considerably below estimates
(13,565 tons vs 25,949 tons, or about 50% lower). The PCR states that at the
time it was prepared many fishing vessels were not operating (see para. 4) and
a large proportion of the fishponds were not at full production or fully
constructed. It estimates, however, that at full development i.e., if all
vessels were operating and all fishponds are at full production, production
would be 32,467 MT per year, or 25% above appraisal estimate. The Bank
believes that this level of development is unlikely to be acheived, owing to
high fuel prices and declining returns to marine fisheries. The Bank agrees,
nevertheless, with the PCR's conclusion that total inland production will
exceed appraisal estimates after the fishponds are fully producing.
4.        Concerning the marine vessels, the project financed more units than
expected but, owing to the impact of inflation on various types of vessels,
boats of a different character turned out to be more attractive to borrowers.

DBP financed (i) the construction of 43 vessels of various sizes, (ii) re-
powering of two trawlers, (iii) conversion of two trawlers into purse seiners
and (iv) the construction of 3 ice plants. No application was received for a
slipway. By 1981 six of the financed vessels had been lost or abandoned.
Research for the PCR showed 37 vessels operable in 1981 but apparently only
13 were actually operating. The PCR does not comment on the difference, but
the vessel survey was carried out during one of the traditional three lean
fishing months. Two of the three ice plants were inoperable. The third was
operating substantially below capacity. Although not explained in the PCR, it
is the Bank's view that this results from poor market analysis and oversatura-
tion of local markets with icing facilities. One of the difficulties of DBP's
current project monitoring system is that there are no data available
regarding actual operations of subprojects. As stated in the PCR, this
reflects weaknesses in DBP's supervision effort and monitoring and evaluation
system. The Bank agrees with this view.
5.        At appraisal it had been expected that 9,100 hectares of brackish-
water fishponds would be built or rehabilitated for milkfish culture. In
fact, a total of 13,459 ha (48% higher) of both brackish and fresh water ponds
were financed to raise milkfish and shrimp (brackish water) and carp and
tilapia (fresh water). Average output per hectare, however, is likely to be
67% of appraisal estimates, although farmers applying careful management
techniques far exceed appraisal estimates. According to the PCR, the
inclusion of shrimp culture was owing to rising export demand and new culture
technologies; the inclusion of fresh water projects was owing to residual
demand from the first fisheries project. In both the inland and marine
components the difference between appraisal estimates and actual outcomes
reflects changing perceptions of individual private entrepreneurs concerning
the potential returns in alternative investment. This, in turn, increased or
reduced demand for particular kinds of loans. In this regard the differences
are not only to be expected, but also welcomed, and the Bank supports the
changes in emphasis.
Project Implementation
6.        The project became effective on November 11, 1976, about 5 weeks
later than expected owing to delays in the completion of the subsidiary loan
agreement between DBP and the Government. Disbursements began relatively
quickly because of an existing pipeline of approvals from the first fisheries
project. Subsequently, they slowed down so that actual disbursements took 8
months longer than estimated at appraisal, but the project was fully disbursed
and closed 4 months ahead of schedule. Although not covered in the PCR, the
slow down in commitments resulted from reduced demand for new trawlers
resulting from fuel price increases. In addition, diminished financial
returns to investors in new fishponds, owing to rapidly accelerated
construction costs of new ponds, reduced demand somewhat, but rehabilitated
ponds remained attractive and kept overall aquaculture loan demand high.

7.        The project provided for IBRD to finance 50% of the total cost of
aquaculture investments ($7.3 million) and the foreign cost of marine sector
investments ($4.6 million). At appraisal, it was anticipated this would
result in the Bank financing 61% of aquaculture loans and 71% of marine loans.
In fact, owing to higher total project costs (including working capital
amounts), tne Bank's share of total project costs were 47% and 56% respec-
tively. The increased amount was financed by the investors themselves as
equity and by DBP as working capital loans, but the PCR does not specify the
proportion between the two.
8.        On the institutional side the PCR reports a definite positive impact
on DBP. After 1976, and directly resulting from the project, DBP increased
its fisheries staff by 90% and began the reassignment of head office fisheries
personnel to branches. In addition, in the course of project implementation
the fisheries group in DBP was divided into separate evaluation and supervi-
sion divisions, and a new agriculture planning and programming staff was set
up to plan all agriculture operations, including fisheries work. These
changes, and well prepared appraisal formats for project evaluation, have led
to good technical subproject appraisal, although the Bank believes that
frequently nonbanking considerations have affected loan approvals. The PCR
states that supervision has, however, been less well handled. This is true.
This resulted partially from the limited usefulness of DBP's collaboration
(described in the appraisal report) with the Government's Bureau of Fisheries
and Aquatic Resources (BFAR). Although in concept BFAR was to assist DBP in
project preparation and supervision, it did not, according to DBP, have the
staff available for this after meeting its other commitments.
Financial Impact on DBP
9.         The financial impact of the project has been negative for DBP,
largely owing to high past dues and low collections. In 1980 (the last year
for which data are apparently available) cash and noncash collections for
subloans under the project amounted to only 28% of total collectibles.
Although this performance was slightly better than agriculture operations as a
whole, it is still cause for serious concern. Assuming collections for this
project followed the overall institutional trend in 1981, this level probably
deteriorated further. DBP in its PCR offers no comment on the reasons for
this poor performance. In the Bank view it stems from: weak supervision, a
public perception that DBP loans are Government grants and diminished returns
for marine fishing. Consistent with the poor collections, the project is
currently a negative cash drain on DBP. In addition, and unrelated directly
to project implementation results, the PCR calculates that the Government will
suffer a foreign exchange loss on the Bank loan of at least $1.7 million
through 1994. This loss would result from exchange rate fluctuations between
the time of disbursement of Bank funds and final repayment.

Financial and Economic Impact
10.       As part of the PCR, DBP calculated financial and economic rates of
return for actual marine vessels financed and typical fishpond construction
and rehabilitation projects. DBP's methodology in carrying out this work is
acceptable. The results of these calculations show that the larger trawlers
expected at appraisal are not financially attractive and only marginally
satisfactory economically. These conclusions are consistent with current
experience which has seen a tapering off of loan demand for larger marine
vessels. Similarly, financial returns on new fishpond investment are no
longer satisfactory, although in some cases economic returns are. (Unlike the
SAR, DBP calculates economic returns on a regional basis, which reflect local
cost and benefit structures and different rates of return). In contrast to
new ponds, rehabilitated ponds remain attractive, although less financially
attractive than expected at appraisal.
11.        Survey results from January 1982 indicate that employment resulting
from the project far exceeded estimates owing to the larger number of vessels
financed and greater labor intensity on fishponds (1 employee per 11 hectares,
vs I employee per 16 hectares estimated at appraisal). DBP also carried out
a sample survey of 74 fishpond owners to gauge the rough income impact of
the project.   These data showed that 72% of investors involved in rehabilita-
tion/expansion reported higher incomes as opposed to 65% of investors in new
ponds. Of all classes surveyed 29% experienced no change or lower income.
There are no data on income from fishing vessels.
Subloan Policies and Procedures
12.        The PCR indicates that although appraisals and credit checks were
adequately done, the supervision by DBP and assistance from BFAR did not
fulfill expectations. This could in part explain the poor collection levels.
The PCR indicates that this resulted from a shortage of staff.      During the
course of project implementation onlending rates were raised from 12%-14% to
14% to 16%, depending on collateral. This was appropriate in view of a
general rise in market rates. On the other hand, a rise in the penalty rate
to 3% per month had the negative result of increasing arrears of projects
suffering initial implementation delays. Subsequently, the penalty rate was
removed.
Effectiveness of Bank Supervisions
13.        DBP was unable to find in its file extensive evidence of Bank
supervision efforts, although the PCR concludes that the comments made in one
aide-memoire played a key role in institutional strengthening of DBP. Full
reports of supervision missions were unavailable to DBP in preparing the PCR
and DBP cannot fully comment on internal Bank reports. As the Bank had a
number of ongoing operations with DBP during this period, it is difficult to
say that the official supervision reports represent the sum of field



- 98 -
supervision work. Indeed, the Bank files show extensive supervision support
(especially to review ferroconcrete boat construction) which was of assistance
to DBP, but whichi is not part of field supervision work. Having said this,
however, it appears that supervision missions were fewer than warranted.
There is a 28-month period from 1978 to 1981 when apparently no supervision
report was submitted and there is also no evidence in the files that one
mission (the first) produced a report.
Conclusions
14.        DBP has prepared a useful, self-critical PCR which recognizes its
own strengths and weaknesses. In some ways the project exceeded apprasial
expectations, while in others it did not, but on balance the overall project
outcome was favorable. The project exceeded its lending targets and the
analysis in the PCR states its economic impact at full operations would be
above appraisal estimates. Nevertheless, the financial impact on DBP has been
negative, loan recovery weak and the income benefits to subborrowers In some
cases modest. Employment generation has exceeded estimates and the
institution building impact on DBP has been good.
