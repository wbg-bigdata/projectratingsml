MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF IDA
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF CAMBODIA
FOR A PHNOM PENH POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Kingdom of Cambodia for SDR 25.8 million, the
equivalent of US$40 million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help
finance a project for the rehabilitation of Phnom Penh's power system.
Background
2.    The Kingdom of Cambodia, with an area of 180,000 km2 and a population of
around 10 million, is one of the poorest countries in the world: per capita gross domestic
product (GDP) is US$200. The largest city is Phnom Penh, the capital, with a population
of about 800,000. After a long period of war and political disruption, the Government has
made impressive progress on the macroeconomic front; high inflation has been brought
under control, the exchange rate stabilized and growth has been relatively strong -- official
data show real GDP growth of 4.1% in 1993 and 4.0% in 1994. This improvement is
associated also with the introduction of market reforms and the political security provided
by a United Nations intervention that allowed the election and establishment of a coalition
government, business activities to increase and foreign investment to begin flowing into
the country. Nevertheless, progress is threatened by a breakdown of basic infrastructure,
including the power supply, which was virtually destroyed in past years, and by an overall
fragile security situation.
3.    The organizational framework of the energy sector was changed when the current
administration took office. The Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy (MIME) was
established in 1993 with the following broad responsibilities: (a) planning, formulating
policy, regulating and auditing the sector; (b) generating and distributing electricity; and
(c) coordinating energy projects (including donor activities). Electricity supply is the
responsibility of Electricite' du Cambodge (EDC), a national utility that reports to, and
operates under the direct supervision of, MIME. EDC is the largest organization in the
sector. The private sector also supplies various forms of energy.
4.    The Government's overall objective is to rebuild the country, sustain its
development, and realize its full economic potential. To achieve this, its energy policy
aims to: (a) provide an adequate supply of low-cost energy throughout the country; (b)
ensure a reliable, secure electricity supply at prices that facilitate investment; (c) encourage
exploration and environmentally and socially acceptable development of energy resources
to supply the needs of all sectors; and (d) encourage the efficient use of energy and
minimize environmental degradation related to energy use. While this policy addresses
long-term issues, short-term Government objectives focus on restoring an adequate energy
supply as soon as possible.



-2 -
5.    All the commercial energy used in Cambodia is imported. Electricity is generated
through small, isolated thermal systems that are usually diesel fired. By far the largest is in
Phnom Penh, where consumption accounts for more than 85 percent of the national total.
At the national level, electricity use was approximately 26 kWh per person per year, one
of the lowest levels in Asia (average consumption among countries of the region is 815
kWh per capita, while in Thailand and Vietnam it reaches 980 kWh and 110 kWh,
respectively). In Phnom Penh, only 25 MW (of the total 71 MW installed capacity) are
available for normal operations; this does not meet the city's demand, which is estimated
at 55-60 MW. Thus, if Cambodia is to sustain moderate economic growth, Phnom Penh's
power shortage needs to be overcome. To this end, various new generating sets are being
installed, with the support of several donors (Asian Development Bank, Japan
International Cooperation Agency and IDA). However, this additional capacity of about
40 MW will not be enough to meet future demand and provide a reliable supply. Thus, the
Government has decided to expand generation through direct private participation. A
power purchase agreement for a 35 MW diesel plant was signed recently, and generation
additions beyond 1998 are being assessed.
6.    Phnom Penh's distribution network is old and minimally maintained. Hence, the
network is expected to suffer from interruptions, failures and high losses (currently around
35-40 percent) until it is rehabilitated. Power outages are so acute that economic
activities and essential services (such as water treatment and pumping) are severely
curtailed. As a result, many consumers have installed their own generating units at high
investment and operating costs.
7.    EDC's financial situation is precarious. Although electricity tariffs are relatively
high -- 245 and 350 Riel/kWh (9.8 and 14 UScents/kWh) for wholesale and retail
customers respectively -- steep production costs, high losses and a poor collections record
have caused EDC to run a large cash deficit in past years, covered by the Ministry of
Economy and Finance (MEF). At present, 148 wholesalers distribute power, obtained
through metered supply from EDC and sold to approximately 40,000 individual
customers. Although this arrangement relieves EDC from retail operations, it is a main
source of inefficiencies resulting in high technical losses and a major constraint to EDC's
finances.
8.    The sector's maladies go beyond its poor technical and financial performance.
EDC is a weak utility that lacks skilled management and technical staff. A large part of
the problem stems from past policies which treated the power sector as a public service
instead of a commercial operation. Consequently, the Government's role was not limited
to formulating policy but included direct intervention in daily operations. The sector's
new organization still mandates that EDC report directly to the MIME, and it gives no
autonomy to operate the utility efficiently. Also, it gives the MIME multiple roles -- as
policy maker, regulator and operator -- that create a conflict of functions. The
Government is aware of these problems and is committed to introducing reforms that will
commercialize the sector and introduce efficiency incentives. A first step towards these



- 3 -
objectives has been the agreement reached between MIME and EDC to implement a two-
year Performance Plan.
9.    The Government issued in 1994 an energy sector position paper that proposes to
enact a new power sector law that would facilitate private participation, and to establish
EDC as an autonomous juridical entity. The Government's immediate strategy aims at:
(a) re-establishing an adequate supply of electricity nationwide; (b) strengthening the
sector's managerial and implementing capability, to ensure the effectiveness and
sustainability of current and future operations; and (c) creating the appropriate
environment needed to promote a sustained, efficient and environmentally sound growth
and operation of the sector, open to competition and private sector participation. In
support of this strategy, measures are being launched with assistance from the IDA (under
both the project and the on-going Emergency Rehabilitation Project), other donors and
the private sector to: (a) expand the generating capacity in Phnom Penh and several
provincial regions; (b) rehabilitate Phnom Penh's distribution system; and (c) strengthen
EDC's management and technical capability through a United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP)-funded Bank-executed technical assistance (TA) project.  In
addition, IDA has been supporting the MIME's preparation of an Electricity Act and
statutes to establish EDC as a separate juridical entity. Further IDA support will include
TA for designing a suitable structure for the sector and utility, and setting up an
appropriate regulatory framework.
10.   The Government has agreed on a timetable for sector reform that includes: the
establishment of EDC as a separate juridical entity by December 31, 1995, the enactment
of the Electricity Act not later than June 30, 1996, and the establishment of an
autonomous regulatory body for the sector by September 30, 1996.
Project Objectives
11.   The main objectives of the project, which has been designed to be consistent with
the Bank's power sector strategy, are to support the rehabilitation urgently needed for
Phnom Penh's distribution system as well as the Government's initial efforts to strengthen
sector institutions. Also, the project would help create an environment in which the power
sector can be developed and operated efficiently, including the involvement of the private
sector. To this end, the project will finance priority investments and provide much needed
TA.
Project Description
12.   The project includes the following principal components:
(a) Rehabilitation of Phnom Penh's distribution system comprising: (i)
construction of about 23 km of 115 kV transmission circuits around the
perimeter of Phnom Penh to connect three new primary 115/22kV
substations; (ii) construction of about 100 cct-km of 22 kV underground and



- 4 -
overhead lines, 300 km of low voltage lines, 40 MVA of distribution
transformers, 20 MVAr power factor correction equipment and about 40,000
consumer connections; (iii) provision of support facilities, including tools and
equipment, communications, storage areas and logistics controls; and (iv)
improvement of environmental and safety conditions at existing power
plants.
(b)  TA  comprising assistance for:  (i) within EDC  -- procurement and
engineering, importation of management services, strengthening of
commercial operations, setting up of an environmental unit, implementing the
land acquisition and compensation plan and training EDC staff, and (ii)
within MIME -- defining and implementing a new sector structure and
regulatory framework, and training staff in energy planning.
13.   The IDA Credit equivalent to US$40 million will be made to Cambodia on
standard terms. The financing required for the project (including capitalized interest
during construction) is estimated at about US$46 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of about US$37 million equivalent. The Credit would finance the
full foreign exchange cost less interest during construction (US$34.3 million equivalent)
and 64% of local costs for locally manufactured items, equipment and construction net of
taxes (US$5.7 million equivalent). The Government would use about US$0.8 million of
the Credit towards the TA for MIME. The balance would be fully passed on to EDC in
two parts, the equivalent of US$6 million as equity contribution, and the remaining about
US$33.2 million equivalent as a subsidiary loan. The Government has agreed that it would
enter into a subsidiary loan agreement with EDC within three months after EDC is
established as a separate entity (i.e., by March 31, 1996). It also agreed that onlending
will be in US$ at a variable interest rate equal to LIBOR plus one half of one percent
(1/2%), with repayment over 17 years, including a grace period of 5 years. A breakdown
of the project costs and the financing plan are presented in Schedule A. Procurement
amounts and methods and the disbursement profile are shown in Schedule B. The
timetable of the project's key processing events and status of Bank Group operations in
Cambodia are presented in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 14378-KH, dated September 5, 1995 is being distributed
separately.
Project Implementation
14.   The project will be carried out in accordance with a project implementation plan.
EDC will be responsible for implementing the project, except for the TA activities within
the MIME which will be implemented by the MIME. It will obtain adequate consultant
services for management, design and procurement activities, as well as for supervising
construction. EDC has established a Project Management Unit (PMNU) with responsibility
for ensuring implementation of all project components in accordance with the project
design and objectives. The 115 kV transmission lines will be constructed and the 115/22
kV substations installed through single-responsibility turnkey contracts. The PMU will
establish project teams to supervise the construction of the distribution works. Planning



- 5 -
for the medium voltage (MV) rehabilitation program will be linked to the commissioning
of the 35 MW private plant; this will ensure that power can be evacuated without
incurring penalties. Planning for the low voltage (LV) construction program will be
coordinated with EDC's plans to phase out or change the role of electricity wholesalers.
The project will encourage the participation of local contractors in the construction of
distribution components under the supervision of the PMU.
15.   Procedures for monitoring the physical works and financial reports have been
agreed upon with EDC, which will furnish quarterly progress reports. These procedures
are reflected in EDC's Project Implementation Plan. Project supervision will focus on the
following: (a) EDC's investment plan and tariffs; (b) compliance with financial covenants;
(c) technical supervision and consultant studies, (d) compensation for the transmission line
right of way (ROW); and (e) reforms in the power sector.
Project Sustainability
16.   The technologies for all project components are conventional and well proven. All
project components are essential for re-establishing an adequate power supply in Phnom
Penh, hence they are clearly justified in economic terms. Continuation of ongoing
management support to EDC and the fact that the PMU is already established will be
conductive to the utility's strengthening and the project's efficient implementation, thus
assuring its physical and economic sustainability. On the financial side, the Government is
committed to keeping energy prices at market levels and has agreed to support EDC in
meeting its financial targets. Current efforts in strengthening EDC's management and
commercial capability, complemented by a considerable reduction of losses to be achieved
by the project, as well as the maintenance of current tariff levels, would contribute
towards the project's financial sustainability.
Lessons from Previous IDA Involvement
17.   There have been no previous direct IDA operations in the power sector in
Cambodia. However, the ongoing IDA credit for the Emergency Rehabilitation Project
contains an infrastructure component, including additional 10 MW generating capacity in
Phnom Penh. Two main lessons have been learnt from this ongoing operation. First: public
entities' implementation capacity is extremely weak; and second: local ownership is an essential
condition to guarantee an effective implementation of projects. These lessons have been
incorporated in the preparation of the project. Accordingly, a TA component will be provided
to strengthen EDC's implementation capability, and the project has been designed in close
coordination with EDC staff, including an early preparation of bidding documents.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
18.   The policies and programs pursued by the Government and supported by the
project are substantially in compliance with the Bank's policies and guidelines for power
sector operations. The project fits well with the IDA's Country Assistance Strategy



-6 -
(CAS, Report No. 14465-KH) presented to the Board on June 8, 1995. As discussed in
the CAS, the Bank's support to Cambodia for the next year will focus on: (a) assisting the
Government to strengthen its capacity in setting clear priorities and implementing
development programs; (b) carrying out further analytical work; and (c) supporting critical
measures that will have a significant and quick impact within each sector. The project is in
compliance with all of the above mentioned approaches.
19.   Cambodia's investment requirements in power are large (above US$170 million in
the medium-term). While IDA can only finance a fraction of these needs, its participation
in supporting urgent distribution investments will help fill a critical gap and at the same
time will provide enough confidence to help in attracting funds for generation from public
and private sources. The Government has stated clearly its interest in reforming the power
sector, attracting private participation, and strengthening its institutions. Through its
involvement in financing EDC's program, IDA will be able to play a key role in helping the
Government in the initial stage of reform, and over time help the Government effectively
address  issues  relating  to:  (a) power sector regulation,   restructuring  and
commercialization; (b) institutional strengthening; (c) investment planning and resource
pricing; (d) environmental discipline; and (e) establishment of a land acquisition and
compensation policy.
Agreed Actions
20.  Agreement has been reached with the Borrower that it would inter alia:
(a) implement a timetable for the reform of the power sector, which includes the
establishment of EDC as a separate entity by December 31, 1995, the
enactment of the Electricity Act by June 30, 1996, and the establishment of an
autonomous regulatory body for the power sector by September 30, 1996 (if
any of these events do not take place by their respective date, IDA would
have the right to suspend Credit disbursements);
(b)  implement the Land Acquisition and Compensation Plan in a manner
satisfactory to IDA, and monitor its implementation on a regular basis;
(c)  enter into a subsidiary loan agreement with EDC, under commercial terms
satisfactory to IDA, within three months after EDC is established as a
separate juridical personality;
(d)  take all action necessary to ensure that MIME and EDC carry out the
Performance Plan;
(e)  ensure that EDC redefines the role of, or phases out, all electricity wholesalers
prior to the initiation of the low voltage construction program under the
project;



- 7 -
(f)  review  annually EDC's investment program  and electricity tariffs, in
consultation with IDA, and thereafter make the necessary adjustments;
(g)  approve the reconstituted balance sheet of EDC and assist EDC to collect
outstanding account receivables not later than February 28, 1996; and
(h)  take all measures required to ensure that EDC: (i) produces sufficient
revenues to cover all its expenses; (ii) produces rates of return on revalued
assets of not less than 6% in FY99 and thereafter; and (iii) reduces account
receivables to three months of sales revenue by December 31, 1998, and to
2.5 months of sales revenue by December 31, 1999.
Environmental and Social Aspects
21.   The project's overall environmental impact is expected to be positive, since an old,
hazardous distribution system will be replaced, energy losses will be reduced and
consequently, a large number of inefficient generating units will cease to operate. In
addition, the project will upgrade the existing power stations in Phnom Penh, improving
environmental and safety conditions. Accordingly, the project has been classified in the B
category.
22.   The project's environmental impact was assessed focusing on: (a) route selection
and effects of the proposed transmission line and associated substations; and (b) clean-up
and safety at existing power stations. Social and environmental issues were key factors
for the selection of the transmission line route and location of substations. Overhead 115
kV pole-mounted lines routed along roads will minimize ROW requirements. The
following components will involve land acquisition: two (out of three) grid substations
and the 23 km transmission line. In total, the project will affect 32 households, of which
15 houses will need to be relocated. The Government has given its official approval for
the Land Acquisition and Compensation Plan and it will implement this Plan, in a manner
acceptable to IDA, before the transmission line and substations contracts are awarded.
Benefits and Risks
23.   The project would help ensure the country's economic growth, as it would provide
badly needed capital to rehabilitate Phnom Penh's power system, which, in turn, would
remove a main infrastructure bottleneck. The main benefits of the project are: (a) the
improvement of the reliability of supply to existing consumers; (b) the reduction of system
losses and increase of transmission and distribution efficiency; and (c) the provision of
additional distribution capacity to satisfy rapidly growing demand. Improved reliability
will increase quality of supply and reduce the economic losses from outages and voltage
fluctuation; loss reduction and capacity increase will allow to increase sales at least cost
while contributing towards a more efficient use of energy. The internal economic rate of
return of the project is estimated at 21.5%. The project will contribute also towards the
strengthening and modernization of sector institutions, preparing them to handle



-8 -
effectively the urgent requirements of the power system and enabling the environrnent for
a sustained and efficient growth and operation of the power sector, open to private
participation. The achievement of these long term objectives would allow ultimately the
reduction of real tariff levels while keeping an adequate quality of supply.
24.   Project risks are primarily associated with the weaknesses of the sector
institutions. If these weaknesses are not addressed effectively, the project could face
delayed procurement and implementation, cost overruns and poor operation and
maintenance. To mitigate these risks, the TA component of the project will provide the
services of foreign experts to adequately train the local staff, supervise the works and
control the quality of the results. With regard to the broader institutional framework, the
Government has demonstrated the willingness to implement reforms to create an efficient,
autonomous and commercially viable power utility and open the sector to private
participation; this would indicate that the risk of lack of commitment is low. The TA and
capacity building component of the project will specifically assist the power utility and the
Ministry in defining and implementing the reform process. Country risks that may affect
the project are of political nature. The current political situation is fragile and could
change in any number of directions. The project is proposed under the assumption that
governance will improve as legal reform, civil service reform and training programs
progress and the political situation remains stable.
Recommendation
25.   I am  satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
