STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT ON THE
PROPOSED SECOND CALI WATER SUPPLY
AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
CHAPTER I
THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Introduction
1.01      Empresas Municipales de Cali (EMCALI), a municipally-owned public
utility, has requested Bank financing for a proposed second water supply and
sewerage project. The information normally obtained during appraisal was
collected by a supervision mission in October 1976. A second mission, which
consisted of Messrs. Robert Wildeman, Ernesto Maisch, and Jorge Culagovski,
completed field appraisal in February 1977. Technical studies for the project
were carried out by EMCALI, together with their consultants, Planes Indecom of
Colombia. The total financing required is estimated at US$33.7 million. A
Bank loap of US$13.8 million is recommended to cover the foreign exchange
component as well as interest and commitment charges during construction.
National Context
Population
1.02      The total population of Colombia is about 24.2 million people and
is growing at an average annual rate of 2.8%. Unlike many Latin American
countries, the urban population is widely distributed among several inter-
mediate and large cities. Of the total population, about 15% are living in the
capital city, Bogota, which now has a population estimated at 3.5 million.
Medellin and Cali, the second and third largest cities respectively, have
already surpassed the one million mark, while Barranquilla has over 700,000
inhabitants; Cartagena, Bucaramanga, Manizales and Pereira each have about
300,000 and 13 other cities have over 100,000 inhabitants.
Urban Growth
1.03      Colombia has experienced high rates of urban growth.  The proportion
of the urban population (living in towns of more than 2,500 inhabitants)
increased from 31% of the population in 1938 to 61% in 1973 and is estimated
to exceed 70% or about 16 million people by the end of 1977.  During the
period from 1951 to 1964, which coincided with widespread rural violence,
urban growth peaked at an average annual rate of 5.5%, but decreased to an
average annual rate of 4.6% during the 1964-75 period. This was 50% more than
the rate of total population growth, which also decreased from a peak of 3.2%
during the 1951-64 period, to 2.8% during the 1964-75 period. This rate is
expected to remain relatively constant over the next few years.



1.04      Recent estimates of the rates of net migration indicate that the
predominantly urban orientation of the migration continues to hold, and net
inflows have tended to converge on those cities which have the best employment
opportunities. Given the age selectivity of migration, the population of the
cities is relatively young. More than 64% of the urban population are less
than 25 years old. The labor force under 25 years old in the cities tends to
be especially high, and in recent years, it has risen from 29% in 1964 to 32%
in 1973.  The urban population includes a disproportionate number of women;
115 women for each 100 men, compared with 91 women for each 100 men in the
rural areas.  About 20% of the population of Cali ranks among the urban poor.
This compares to an estimated 25% for Latin America as a whole.
1.05      Industry is concentrated around the four largest cities, Bogota,
Medellin, Cali and Barranquilla, which account for over 80% of the industrial
employment and output. The continued migration to the cities has created
intractable problems of unemployment and urban poverty, and has put severe
pressure on the infrastructure resources of the communities. The urban
growth resulted in a significant housing deficit.
Sector Context
Service Levels
1.06      The availability of water supply and sewerage facilities in Colombia
ranks among the highest in Latin America. However, even though the aggregate
growth in services has been fairly rapid during the last 10 years, service
levels vary by both family income and size of city. One-fourth of the aggre-
gate urban population still do not have direct access to public water
supply, and about 60% do not have direct access to public sewerage systems.
In the rural areas, about 33% of the aggregate population have access to water,
while only 13% have access to public sewerage systems.
1.07      Sewage and industrial wastes are largely untreated.  So far,
pollutant loads have been low compared with the natural purification of the
receiving rivers, and wastewaters have been dispersed without much nuisance
or causing harmful deoxygenation of the river waters. Problems, however,
have emerged in Bogota, Cartagena and Cali. The Bank is considering a River
Rectification and Regulation Project for Bogota, a study of which was financed
under the Bank's loan 741-CO. The Bank is also considering an Urban Develop-
ment Project for Cartagena which would address this problem. The existing
problem for Cali would be solved with the proposed project.
Finances
1.08      Urban water and sewerage systems are financed partly from internally
generated funds, and partly from direct grants from the National Government.
The local taxing power of urban governments is limited by the regional admin-
istration for all cities except Bogota. Prior to 1968, most urban infra-
structure was financed by National Government agencies and subsidized from



- 3 -
national funds. The 1968 reforms, however, created among other things a
decentralization of responsibility for public services to the cities, with the
requirement that tariff structures be more effective for income distribution
purposes, and that they be set at levels at least sufficient to recover all
costs. Water sewerage and storm water drainage systems not susceptible to
user charges are frequently financed through a betterment levy (impuesto de
valorizacion) imposed on the presumed beneficiaries of public infrastructure.
Such levies have been particularly successful in Colombia, especially regarding
urban road and sewerage systems construction.
Past Investments and Financing
1.09      Annual investments in the sector increased from US$21.6 million in
1965 to US$55.8 million in 1975, and total investments for that period were
US$392 million. Of this, 72% was expended by the municipal entities, 20% by
INSFOPAL, and 8% by INAS communities. About 35% of the total investment was
financed by the national budget, 20% from external sources, and the remaining
45% from domestic credits and internally generated funds.
1.10      External assistance for the sector started about 15 years ago, and
US$232.4 million was committed from 1961-75. Of this amount, 68.2% was from
the Bank, 24.0% was from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and the
remainder from USAID, Eximbank, and the German Kreditanstalt. The Bank has
already made 6 loans amounting to US$158.6 million for Bogota, Cali and
Palmira, as well as to INSFOPAL for 15 medium-size cities and 30 towns. IDB
has made 10 loans totalling US$43.4 million. Two of these, made to INSFOPAL
in 1962, amounted to US$10.6 million and were for 327 towns. In addition,
USAID made a sector loan of US$29 million in June 1971 for urban development.
Sector Organization
1.11      The water supply and sewerage sector comprises three main categories:
(i)  The Empresas:
Twenty-one cities with populations ranging from 25,000 to
3 million have their own municipal entities to provide
public services. These cities have a combined population of
about 8 million, or about one-third of the total population.
From 70% to 96% of this population receive water supply
services, and about 50% to 80% are connected to public sewerage
systems. In general, the empresas are reasonably well-run,
and finance their system expansion with internal funds,
suppliers' credits, and loans from the National Government
and foreign lending institutions.



-4-
(ii) INSFOPAL:
The remaining cities with more than 2,500 inhabitants have their
water supply systems coordinated by the Instituto Nacional de
Fomento Municipal, which was recently reorganized as a government
agency in charge of the finances, planning and technical assistance
for the sector. The total population served by these systems is 6
million, or one-fourth of Colombia's population. Approximately 70%
of the inhabitants in this group have direct access to piped water
while only 50% are connected to a sewerage system. The quality of
services is poorer than that of the empresas previously described,
administrative competence is usually less, and their operating
deficits and investments are generally financed with Government
grants.
(iii) INAS:
The rural communities of fewer than 2,500 inhabitants have their
systems planned and executed by the Instituto Nacional de Salud
(INAS). About 33% of the population in this group receive water
supply services, while only 13% have access to sewerage facilities.
Government Objectives
1.12      The Government's objective is to extend by 1980 water supply and
sewerage facilities to a least 80% of the total urban population. Within this
objective, the Government has pursued a policy of improving the infrastructure
services in the smaller and medium-size cities, which it hopes will slow down
the migration into the four largest urban areas. An important expression of
this policy has been a program of lending for medium-size cities by INSFOPAL,
which was supported by a Bank loan of US$9.1 million in 1973 and US$27.0
million in 1975. The purpose of these loans was to help finance water and
sewerage facilities in 15 cities with populations from 50,000 to 700,000. The
Government's effort in attaining these objectives has been directed not only
to providing funds for priority projects, but also to strengthening certain
key agencies, so that they would become more efficient and would be better
able'to identify, plan and evaluate projects in the sector.
Constraints
1.13      At the national level, a major constraint is the generation of
sufficient savings to implement the necessary public investment program, and
to ensure adequate resources for private investment activity. At the local
level, the major constraint has been primarily institutional problems, espe-
cially poor planning by the local entities and the traditionally low tariffs
which have made it difficult to raise large capital sums needed for new works.
Inflation and opposition to tariff increases have aggravated the situation.
In some of the cities water demand has not increased at quite the rate
forecast, and consequently some of the empresas have experienced diffi-
culty in financing their share of the investment costs. In this connection,
the mobilization of internal resources through increased tariffs is of



-5-
vital importance. The magnitude of the required increases, however, is in
many cases such that the Government goals may not be reached on schedule.
Bank objectives
1.14      In lending to Colombia for Water Supply and Sewerage, the Bank
assists the Government in achieving four major objectives. These objectives
are interdependent and complementary. One objective is to improve the
standard of living of the lowest 50% of the population, while providing some
additional employment and raising labor productivity. A second objective is
to help Colombia relieve the existing and potential near-term problems of
pollution, both in the disposal of sewage (paragraph 1.07) and solid wastes.
A third objective is to support programs that will bring about improvements in
management practices and, particularly, that will help to strengthen public
institutions and financial intermediaries. A fourth objective is to establish
financial policies that will ensure an adequate level of investments in a
framework of self-financing within the sector.
1.15      Naturally, many operations in the water supply and sewerage sector
serve more than one of the ends listed above. Thus, the proposed second Cali
water supply and sewerage project is designed to improve the living conditions
of the poorest sectors of Cali's populations, to give the neighboring Munici-
pality of Yumbo an input that will enable it to attract industry and thus
increase employment and production, and to strengthen the financial situation
of EMCALI which, both in terms of assets and employees, is the largest enter-
prise in the area.

CHAPTER II
THE BORROWER
Introduction
2.01      The proposed project would be the second Bank operation in the water
supply sector in Cali. The borrowing and executing agency would be the Empresas
Municipales de Cali (EMCALI), which is a decentralized municipal agency respon-
sible for the administration, construction and maintenance of the water supply,
sewerage, power and telephone facilities within the city of Cali. In 1956
EMCALI agreed to provide power service and in 1966 extended telephone service
to the Municipality of Yumbo, an adjacent community where most of the indus-
trial activity of the region is located.
Background
2.02      EMCALI was created in 1931 as a separate water agency administered
directly by the municipal government. The facilities, which were previously
operated as a city department, consisted of the San Antonio water treatment
plant and the related distribution system. The plant was inaugurated on
December 31, 1930 with an installed capacity of 0.9 m3 per second. In 1944,
E14CALI acquired Colombiana de Electricidad y Telefonica del Pacifico, a
privately held company authorized to sell power and telephone services in
Cali.  In 1961, EMCALI was fully decentralized and was established under law
as an autonomous government agency. In 1962, it assumed responsibility for
providing sanitary sewerage and stormwater drainage services.
Organization
2.03      Until 1972, EMCALI was headed by a six-member Board of Directors,
which consisted of three representatives nominated by the City Council,
and one representative each nominated by the Mayor, the Banco de la Republica,
and the Banco Fidecomisario. Since 1972, EMCALI has been governed by a seven
member Board of Directors appointed for a two-year term by the City Council.
The Mayor of Cali is the ex officio Chairman of the Board and is appointed by
the Governor of the State of the Valle del Cauca, who is in turn appointed by
the President of Colombia. The General Manager is appointed by the Mayor but
his term in office must be ratified by the Board of Directors.
2.04      Effective March 1, 1977 the organizational structure was decentral-
ized into three self-contained operating units, so that water and sewerage,
energy and telephones would function independently, and the units report
directly to the General Manager. Previously they functioned as divisions
responsible only for the physical characteristics of production and distri-
bution. The organizational structure is shown in Annex 1 and is divided into
six major departments--planning, financial, administration, water and sewerage,
energy and telephones--each headed by a sub-manager reporting directly to the
General Manager.



7-
Personnel Review
2.05      In recent years, there have been frequent changes in the position
of General Manager, appointments to which have been clearly political. These
changes contributed significantly to the difficulties encountered by EMCALI in
the recent past. The next level of management has undergone little change,
and is generally considered competent. At the present time, EMCALI has a
total of 2,506 staff members, of which 988 work in the water and sewerage
division, 388 work in the energy division, 609 work in the telephone division,
and 474 are assigned as headquarters administrative staff. Among the total
staff members working in EMCALI, 12 hold executive positions and 53 have
specialized training in engineering. Insofar as an index of one employee per
1,000 persons served is generally considered as more than adequate for water
and sewerage enterprises, the existing level (0.95) indicates that EMCALI is
not overstaffed.
Billing and Collection
2.06      EMCALI customers are presently billed at the end of each month for
up to six services: water, sewerage, energy, telephones, garbage collection
and valorization. Garbage collection is provided by another municipal agency.
However, in order to expedite administrative processing, the service is billed
and collected on behalf of this agency in conjunction with the water and
sewerage bill. Meters are read monthly. With the exception of telephone
service which is billed separately, all five services are rendered on the same
account. Sewerage charges are proportionately fixed at 60% of the water bill.
2.07      In addition, EMCALI collects connection charges and guarantee
deposits. Customers can either make their payments at the central office
of EMCALI, or to designated commercial banks. Delays in payment are minimal
since there is a surcharge after the 10th of the month, and services are
suspended if payment is not made within 60 days of the billing date. Services
are normally reinstated once the consumer has made satisfactory arrangements
to repay the delinquency.
Accounting Practices and Procedures
2.08      The accounting system of EMCALI is computerized, and provides for
the separation of costs by department and by specific work functions within
each department. The accounting practices and procedures are considered
adequate. EMCALI performs an annual physical inventory and the recorded
levels of inventories are considered reliable. However, more useful and
timely information through the accounting system should be established.
The problem appears to be more of a lack of definition of what is required by
management rather than a lack of capability on the part of either the staff
or the accounting system. Assurances were obtained during loan negotiations
that by June 30, 1978 EMCALI would: (i) prepare a program, satisfactory
to the Bank, for the improvement of its management information and budgeting
(paragraph 2.09) and internal auditing procedures (paragraph 2.10), and for
the strengthening of the coordination of the administration and operation of
its divisions (paragraph 2.11); and (ii) to the extent that would be required



- 8 -
by the Bank, employ consultants whose qualifications, experience and terms and
conditions of employment would be satisfactory to the Bank to assist the
borrower in the carrying out of the program referred to above (Sections 3.02
and Schedule 2 Part C 2, Loan Agreement).
Planning and Budgeting
2.09      The financial department is responsible for evaluating the various
financial alternatives available to EMCALI. It is also responsible for the
preparation of the current and capital budgets. Budget controls are weak
and there is still no systematic comparison of actual vs. budgeted results,
nor are there reliable analyses of the budget variances. Assurances were
obtained during loan negotiations that EMCALI would set up a budgetary control
system satisfactory to the Bank under such terms and conditions as described in
paragraph 2.08 above (Schedule 2, Part C 2, Loan Agreement).
Audit
2.10      EMCALI is audited by three separate groups fulfilling three separate
roles. The first two, the Municipal Audit Group and the Internal Audit Group,
are required by law, whereas the last one, the External Auditor, is a require-
ment of the Bank. The following is a description of the functions of each
group:
(i) Municipal Audit Group. This group, also referred to as the
"Auditor Fiscal," assists in the budget preparation, verifies
the legality of payments, and checks inventory quantities. The
municipal audit is a requirement of Colombian law, and the group
reports directly to the Municipal Council.
(ii) Internal Audit Group. The function of the Internal Auditors,
who report directly to the General Manager, is similar to
that of the Municipal Auditors, and has been concentrated
almost entirely on the auditing of expenses; little or no
auditing of revenues is conducted. The group has almost no
expertise in computing technology, and as a result, the
internal control over the computer has been largely ignored.
In addition, the group conducts no procedural audits nor does
it contribute significantly to the management style of EMCALI.
Improving the performance of this section would provide EMCALI
with an important tool for controlling all aspects of its
operation. Assurances were obtained during loan negotia-
tions that EMCALI would improve its internal control procedures
under terms and conditions as described in paragraph 2.08 above
(Schedule 2, Part C 2, Loan Agreement).
(iii)  External Audit.  This function has been performed since 1968
by competent auditors acceptable to the Bank. Although the
practices and procedures of the municipal and internal auditors
are comparable to those of independent auditors, there are
some important differences between the two functions. The
primary concern of the municipal and internal auditors is to



-9-
induce compliance with established policies and procedures.
However, there is a need to obtain reliable financial data
prepared by professional practitioners independent of manage-
ment, both in fact and in mental attitude. Therefore,
assurances were obtained during loan negotiations that the
engagement of external auditors satisfactory to the Bank
would continue, and that their report, complete with the
annual financial statement, would be submitted to the Bank
not later than four months after the end of the fiscal year
(Section 5.02, Loan Agreement).
Work Coordination
2.11      The overall coordination between the departments needs to be streng-
thened, and significantly so between those departments having planning and
financial management responsibilities. Assurances were obtained during loan
negotiations that EMCALI would continue the reorganization started on March 1,
1977 to strengthen coordination of its planning and financial management as an
integrated program with the internal control functions under terms and condi-
tions as described in paragraph 2.08 above (Schedule 2, Part C 2, Loan Agree-
ment).
Insurance
2.12      All EMCALI properties are adequately insured against loss or damage.
In addition, all supply and construction contracts of the proposed project
would be insured against loss and damage in shipment, accidents, fire and
property damage.
Review of the First Project
2.13      The first Bank operation in the water supply sector in Cali (Loan
Agreement 682-CO) was appraised in 1970. The original loan of US$18.5
million is fully disbursed. Civil works are completed and all machinery
and equipment is installed. The Puerto Mallarino water treatment plant, which
is the largest project component, is expected to become fully operational by
January 1978. The project aimed at increasing the overall production and
service levels of water in the city. In this respect good progress has been
made. The percentage of total population served by water increased from 70%
in 1970 to 96% in 1976. In addition, about 80% of the population is served
with sewer connections.
2.14      Initially, progress under the project was slower than anticipated,
mainly because of political and institutional problems and shortfalls in
internal cash generation. The Bank agreed in 1974 to modify the content of
the project by deleting the completion of two sub-projects, the Aguablanca
sanitary interceptor and the Napoles stormwater drainage canal, estimated
at the time of appraisal to cost US$2 million and US$1 million respectively.
At the same time, EMCALI agreed to make financial provision to start const-
ruction of the deleted subprojects by 1976 and complete them by 1978. Largely



- 10 -
because of financial difficulties, EMCALI was unable to comply with the
agreement, and in the meantime, the technical features, designs, costs and
benefits have changed very substantially (paragraph 3.09).
2.15      As shown by the figures in Annex 2, the project increased in price
by 64% during the 1970-76 period; from US$29.8 million in 1970 (net of the two
subprojects that were deleted in 1974) to US$49.0 million in 1976. Of the
total cost increases of US$19.2 million, the Puerto Mallarino subproject
accounted for US$9.3 million, or about 50% of the total, and the other
subprojects accounted for the balance of US$9.9 million. The combined
contingency provision was quite insufficient, and construction costs doubled
in contrast to the 44% increase estimated at the time of appraisal.
2.16      Financial assistance, however, remained unchanged at US$27.5 million,
and consisted of US$18.5 million from the Bank and US$9.0 million from the
National Government. Correspondingly, the portion of the project required to
be financed from its own resources increased from US$2.5 million to US$21.5
million. In order to maintain its construction program, EMCALI relied on the
unsecured creditors to cover the deficiency. This steady erosion of EMCALI's
financial position is discussed in Chapter V.
2.-17     Traditionally, Cali's demand for water has exceeded available supply.
The Puerto Mallarino subproject was intended to eliminate the water shortage
that had characterized Cali in the past. However water consumption has grown
at a considerably slower pace than originally anticipated under Loan Agreement
682-CO. Therefore considerable excess production capacity now exists.

2.18      Population and demand forecasts used in the appraisal estimates were
based on extrapolated growth rates and urbanization trends from the 1945-68
period (paragraph 1.03), and reflected the consumption characteristics of the
higher income groups then served. The difference between forecast and actual
consumption during the 1969-76 period is attributable to the lower growth
rates and urbanization trends, together with the lower per capita consumption
of the poorer income groups, which accounted for the largest portion of the
new consumers during the period. As a result, the volume of water sold was
71% of the appraisal estimates for the 1970-76 period as a whole.

2.19      The lessons learned from this project necessarily involve consider-
ations other than those associated with just the physical constiuction of
production facilities. In this connection it is obvious that the interaction
between (i) population growth, (ii) per capita consumption, and (iii) cost
overruns are fundamental considerations to planning and executing projects.
Specifically the lessons gained from this project were incorporated into the
proposed project and underscore the importance of:
(i) Population Growth and Demand. Projections of future demand
requirements depend almost entirely on the assumptions made
as to changes in population growth and urbanization trends,
which in Colombia have changed significantly in the last few
years. The downward trend in growth rates at the national
level has been reflected in the trend at the local level. As
a very tentative generalization, this suggests that after a
certain stage of development, a tendency exists toward a less
top-heavy distribution of urban size, and also leads to some
expectation of a gradual decline in the growth rates of the
large urban areas. This has been reflected in a downward
revision of demand requirements for the proposed project.
(ii) Per Capita Consumption. The majority of new consumers recently
connected to the Cali system are from the lower-income groups.
There is considerable evidence to suggest that consumption by
this segment of the population is considerably lower than that
of the medium to higher income groups, and that the per capita
consumption of the lower-income groups does not appreciably
increase beyond a certain level. This has been reflected in
a flattening out of the estimated future per capita consumption
for the proposed project.



- 12 -
(iii) Cost overruns. Higher than anticipated inflation rates
have resulted in substantial cost overruns. The acute-
ness of the shortage of resources squeezed the financial
capability of EMCALI. Great care was taken in the pro-
posed project to ensure that the investment costs reflect
realistic estimates of future inflation. To protect the
financing plan and ENCALI's future financial viability,
provision has been made for automatic monthly tariff
increases.

CHAPTER III
SERVICE LEVELS AND DEMAND
City of Cali - Water Supply
3.01      Cali is now served by three water treatment plants: the San Antonio
plant, which draws water from the Cali River, the Cauca River plant and the
Bank-financed Puerto M4allarino plant, which draw water from the Cauca River
and which operate by pumping. The three plants provide a maximum installed
capacity for the city of 9.1 m /sec (paragraph 2.17).  During the last 6 years,
the percentage of total population served by water increased from 70% in 1970
to 96% in 1976. Residential users in 1976 accounted for almost 73% of total
consumption, commercial users 15%, industrial users 4%, and government users
8%. During 1976, approximately 16% of the users accounted for 52% of total
consumption, 38% accounted for 31% of total consumption, and 46% of the users
accounted for the balance. The water consumption during the previous 5 years
was distributed among the following users:

3.02      The population of Cali as recorded in the 1973 census was 0.94
million inhabitants. This was about 23% lower than estimated by a study
conducted by a consulting firm in 1969, and which formed the basis for esti-
mating the demand requirements in the first project. The downward trend in
growth rate is matched by a similar trend in the population of the country as
a whole, and leads to some expectation that lower growth rates are likely to
be permanent. Bogota, the capital city, for example, has experienced a
similar situation. As a result the average annual urban growth rate has been
reduced from 6.0% as estimated under the first project, to 3.9% during the
coming decade. This rate is a composite of the following factors:



- 14 -
(i)  the average annual population growth rate of 2.6% for the
country as a whole as evidenced during the 1964-73 period,
and which has been taken as the basis for estimating the
future natural population growth.
(ii)  an estimated average annual rate of migration from the
rural areas of 1.3%.
3.03             The projections on rural migration are less certain, since they
depend not only on the assumptions made on employment opportunities and the
rise in income levels, but also on changing standards of housing, water
supply, sewerage, streets, and social services, both in the rural areas
affected and Cali. The tentative nature of the growth rates, however, does
not pose a significant risk to the proposed project, since its main emphasis
is on improving the sanitary infrastructure for an existing population. On
the basis of the foregoing assumptions, the population of Cali is expected to
increase from a level of 1.05 million as estimated at the end of 1976, to 1.22
million at the end of 1980, and 1.54 million by the end of 1986.

3.04      Given the expected population growth, the planned increase in
service coverage, improved metering, and the tariff increases already in
effect for excess water use, the total water consumption for the city is
expected to increase at an average annual rate of 4.1% during the 1977-86
period. Per capita consumption, which was as high as 269 liters/person/day in
1972 has been gradually declining over the last 5 years, and was as low as 224
liters/person/day during 1976 (paragraph 2.18). The declining consumption
was partly the result of low-income, low-consumption consumers being connected
to the system, and probably in part due to price elasticity, about which rela-
tively little is known. As service levels approach the 100% mark, the impact
on the average per capita consumption of additional population connected to
the system is expected to be relatively slight. On the other hand, the impact
of price elasticity is expected to be offset by future increases in income
levels. Accordingly, the recent decline in per capita consumption is expected
to level off at 224 liters/person/day, and remain unchanged over the next
decade.
3.05      As improvements are made to the system, unaccounted-for water
which now stands at 27% of production is expected to be reduced to 23%.
On the basis of available information, maximum hourly demand is about 1.5
times the aggregate daily average. To the extent possible, hourly demand
fluctuations are evened out through use of water storage tanks. The proposed
Water Supply Subproject is aimed primarily at extending the distribution
system to the urban poor.
City of Cali - Sanitary Sewerage
Service Levels
3.06      About 80% of the population is connected to the sewerage system.
Of the total area of Cali, about 75% is serviced by a combined sewerage
system; 18% by a separate sewerage system; and about 7% is not serviced at
all. Combined sewers carry both sanitary sewage and stormwater drainage, as
opposed to separate sewers which carry the household and industrial wastes
only. EMCALI is discontinuing the construction of combined sewers. Stormwater
drainage canals have been laid transversely to the sewers, and were designed
to reduce flooding by providing drainage facilities for stormwater flowing
down from the surrounding hills. As an added safety device, and in order to
prevent sewers from backing up during the rainy season, relief sewers connect
the sewerage system to the stormwater drainage canals. The relief sewers were
designed to carry the excess over a certain volume of combined sewage from the
existing sewers to stormwater canals.
3.07      The topography and the place of disposal of sewage in Cali is
such that sewage from the southern zones must be carried outward through
the existing and somewhat smaller trunklines and interceptors of the northern
zones. As shown on the map, the population growth in recent years has been
largely concentrated in the southern zones of the city, and there are now
400,000 people, or 40% of the population, living in these areas. With the
increased volume of sewage, the existing system is of insufficient capacity,



- 16 -
so that sewage is backing up and is diverted through the relief sewers and out
into the surface stormwater drainage canals. As a result the original drain-
age canals are now being used as raw sewage interceptors.
3.08      About 200,000 inhabitants living in the southeastern part of the
city are discharging sewage directly into one of the stormwater drainage
canals, which traverses a densely populated area en route to the Cauca River.
Another 200,000 inhabitants living in the southern and southwestern zones are
discharging sewage into a stormwater drainage canal which flows into the Cauca
River upstream from the water treatment plants. The population discharging
sewage into the latter canal is expected to increase from 200,000 to 400,000
inhabitants by the year 2000. Presently, the contamination of the Cauca River
at the intakes of the two water treatment plants reaches at certain periods a
level of 500 times the bacteriological load that is admissible at the intake of
a water treatment plant. The two water treatment plants supply about 85X of the
total potable water to the city. Consequently, the health risk is serious.
Any failure in the operations of the treatment plants could spread waterborne
diseases in epidemic proportions. The proposed Cauca Interceptor Subproject is
designed to deal effectively with the problem by collecting the sewage from the
southern part of the city and discharging it 300 meters downstream from the
existing water treatment plants into the Cauca River.
3.09      The first Cali Water Supply and Sewerage Project included the Agua
Blanca Interceptor which the Bank agreed in 1974 to delete when the content
of the project was modified (paragraph 2.14). The Aguablanca Interceptor
was estimated at the time of appraisal to cost US$2 million. If the Aguablanca
Interceptor had been completed at the end of 1976, the additional funds neces-
sary to upgrade it to meet the new requirements would have resulted in a total
investment larger than that required for the Cauca Interceptor. The Cauca
interceptor in fact replaces the Agua Blanca Interceptor, but its technical
features, designs, costs, and benefits are substantially different from
those conceived in the original project. As shown by the figures below, the
service area is much larger, and the total length of the interceptor will be
increased by 75%; from 7.4 km to 12.5 km. In addition, the diameter of the
proposed Cauca River interceptor is larger, and its flow capacity is 6.0
m3 /sec instead of 4 m3 /sec. The design horizon has also been increased by
15 years from 1985 to 2000. This would accommodate an increase in the
population to be served, which is expected to increase from 380,000 to 600,000
inhabitants. The Cauca Interceptor subproject is the result of the study of
three alternative solutions (paragraph 4.10).

City of Cali - Stormwater Drainage
3.10      Cali and its suburbs are located in the Cauca Valley and extend
upwards into the foothills which circumscribe the valley to the west. During
the rainy season, which occurs twice a year, from April to June and from
October to December, sudden rainstorms interceded by light showers are common.
Because of the shape of the drainage area and the steep slopes of the surround-
ing hills, the run-off is intense.
3.11      The topography of Cali is such that rainwater drainage does not
require extensive underground collectors, and is concentrated in a few surface
stormwater drainage canals. Two of the existing facilities originally con-
structed by CVC are the stormwater drainage canals that are currently being
used as raw sewage interceptors. These canals, in fact, form the basic
framework for the stormwater drainage system in Cali. The existing stormwater
drainage canals became overloaded during the rainy season, and frequently
flooded certain parts of the city. The problem was reduced by the construc-
tion of the Canaveralejo Reservoir, which was constructed at a somewhat higher
altitude at the western outskirts of the city, and which was financed by the
first project. The reservoir was designed to retain some of the run-off water,
so as to even out the flow and reduce the discharge requirement of the exist-
ing stormwater drainage canals. As a result, the flooding was partially
reduced.
3.12      While the facilities were adequate to relieve the problem in the
western part, the situation persisted in the southern cone. The Canaveralejo
Canal, which drains the reservoir, diagonally traverses the southern part of
the city, en route to the Cauca River. During the rainy season, the canal is
subject to large discharges and spills over and floods large areas in the
southern part of the city. Initial feasibility studies indicated that the
problem would be eliminated with the construction of the Napoles Canal which
was included in the first project.
3.13      When the Bank agreed in 1974 to modify the content of the first
project, the Napoles Canal, which was estimated at time of appraisal to cost
US$1 million, was excluded because of financial constraints (paragraph
2.14), and because the technical aspects appeared not to best meet the require-
ments. The original concept envisioned the Napoles Canal as the additional
overflow facility for the Canaveralejo Reservoir. As a result of two major
floods in 1974 and 1975, engineering consultants were hired to restudy the
precipitation, run-off frequency and peak flows of the entire drainage area.
Consequently, the Napoles Canal was redesigned to eliminate flooding through
its own drainage area and function independently of the Canaveralejo Reservoir.
Therefore the proposed Napoles Canal reflects a different concept than the
canal included under the same name in the first project. To reduce flooding
from Canaveralejo Canal the consultants recommended enlarging the capacity of
the reservoir. This work however has been postponed for some years because of
financial constraints.

The Municipality of Yumbo - Water Demand
3.14      The Municipality of Yumbo is located about 10 km north of Cali.
Its economic growth, related largely to industrial development, has been
constrained by inadequate infrastructure.  The situation has it-proved soewhat
in recent years, particularly with the construction of a new road connecting
Yumbo to Cali, and Yumbo to the Palmaseca International Airport. In addition,
recent improvements to the highway between Cali and the seaport of Buenaventura
have given the industrial community in Yumbo easier access to international
shipping. Energy and telephone services are already provided by EMCALI, and
under the proposed project Yumbo would be connected to Cali's water supply.
3.15      The industrial community of Yumbo, including about 65 industries
employing about 4,000 people, still does not have direct access to a potable
water supply system. Consequently, certain industrial users have constructed
their own facilities, while other smaller consumers have made arrangements to
have their potable water trucked in from Cali. In addition to potable water,
some of the industries use water that does not require extensive treatment.
Water for these uses is drawn from the following sources:
(i)  The Cauca River provides about 0.8 m 3/sec.  Since Yumbo
is located downstream from Cali, the water is highly
polluted and not suitable as a source for drinking water.
.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(ii)  Groundwater, providing about 0.2 m 3/sec from 106 wells, is
adversely affected by a high content of calcium and magnesium.
Water hardness is about 400 mg/l as compared to 50 mg/l from the
Cali water supply system.
3.16      The residential population, on the other hand, is served by a small
municipally owned water treatment plant which has a production capac tt of
0.07 m /sec. The capacity of the plant is limited by the flow of the Yusfio
River from which it draws water. At present, the plant is operating at
about 0.06 m /sec, and only about 60% of the residential demand is satisfied.
As a result, there is rationing, and poor and intermittent service. At times,
water service is shut off for up to 24 hours, so that the risk of contaminate.
groundwater infiltrating the distribution system is significant.  Waterborne
diseases are not uncommon, particularly among infants. The situation is nol:
much better during the rainy season, when the discharge of the river is higler.
The treatment plant still does not have sufficient capacity, and in order to
satisfy the demand, untreated river water is mixed with treated water for
distribution to the consumer. The distribution system is generally in a poor
state of repair, mostly because the Municipality has been unable to finnance an
effective operating and maintenance program.
3.17      As shown by the following table the residential population of Ytmbo is
expected to increase from 32.4 thousand in 1976 to 52.8 thousand by the end of
1986.  The growth in population is expected to decrease from an annuai rate of
7% during the 1972-76 period, when there was an exceptionally high growth due
to the establishment of many industries, to 5% during the 1976-86 period.  Tae
decrease in growth is also commensurate with the trend in Cali and in other
parts of the country.



- 19 -
3.18     3During 1976, water3production and consumption in Yumbo totalled 1.8
million m and 0.9 million m respectively. Unaccounted-for water, which was
0.9 million m3, represented 50% of production. Per capita consumption, which
has been estimated at 190 liters per person per day, and which is expected to
remain unchanged during the next decade, indicates that had the water been
available, consumption would have been about 2.2 million m  during 1976.  In
spite of low production, service levels are high, and it is estimated that 96%
of the population have a water connection. Similarly, almost everyone who has
a water connection has a sewerage connection.
3.19      Statistics for water consumption, however, are not considered
reliable, since more than 50% of the connections are not metered. Corres-
pondingly, it is difficult to establish whether the high proportion of un-
accounted for water is a function of the distribution network, improper
billing practices, or both. Therefore the proposed project would include a
leak detection program and installation of meters. Operation, maintenance and
billing would be handled directly by EMCALI. Assurances were obtained during
loan negotiations that investments will not be made until EMCALI and the
Municipality of Yumbo have entered into an agreement satisfactory to the Bank
defining the procedures under which the network will be operated and maintained
(paragraph 4.07, and Section 5.07(b), Loan Agreement).
3.20      Given the expected population growth, the metering program, and
access to a safe potable supply of water, yearly residential consumption is
estimated to be 2.7 million m  by the end of 1980, and to increase at an average
annual rate of 5% thereafter. As water meters are installed, and the leak
detection program carried out, unaccounted-for water is expected to progressively
decline to 25% by the end of 1986. On the other hand, industrial consumption
is estimated to be 1.9 million m' by the end of 1980 and to increase at an
average annual rate of 8% thereafter. This is considered conservative insofar
as it excludes additional demands that may result from major growth in the
industrialization of the area.

CHAPTER IV
THE PROJECT
Objectives
4.01      The proposed project aims to relieve the existing and potential
near-term problems of Cali through:
(i)   improving sanitary conditions in Cali by moving a raw
sewage discharge to a point downstream from the the city's
main intake of water, and by separating domestic and
industrial sewage from stormwater run-off;
(ii) increasing utilization of EMCALI's installed water production
capacity by extending the distribution network in Cali and
supplying water to the adjacent municipality of Yumbo;
(iii)   improving standards in certain low-income areas by providing
facilities to reduce flooding in them, and extending water
supply and sewerage networks;
(iv) increasing the area available for orderly urban growth; and
(v)   improving the efficiency of E14CALI's management and strengthen
its financial position.
Scope
4.02      The water supply components of the project will be constructed in
areas which have an above average concentration of urban poor or low provision
and access to services. The components would benefit about 160,000 people,
of which about 45% or 70,000 are among the urban poor (paragraph 6.02).
This includes the Municipality of Yumbo which will be connected to EMCALI's
system by the construction of a water transmission pipeline.
4.03      Although about 80% of Cali's population is connected to the sewerage
system, the quality of the service is poor, and constitutes a health hazard,
for several reasons. Firstly, about 75% of the area of the city is serviced
by a combined system carrying both sanitary sewerage and stormwater drainage.
Concentration of recent population growth in the southern zone, where 40% of
Cali's population live, has rendered inadequate the existing system, so that
often sewage backs up and out into the surface stormwater drainage canals.
Secondly, about 200,000 inhabitants living in the southeastern zone discharge
sewage into a stormwater drainage canal which traverses a densely populated
area. Thirdly, another 200,000 inhabitants discharge sewage into a stormwater
drainage canal which flows into the Cauca Rivers upstream from the intake for



- 21 -
two water treatment plants that supply about 85% of Cali's potable water. The
contamination level of the Cauca River has reached 500 times normal health
standards. The proposed Cauca Interceptor sub-project, Sanitary sub-project,
and Stormwater sub-project will remedy these situations. The Stormwater
sub-project aims at stabilizing 535 hectares already urbanized, as well as
1,500 hectares that will enable orderly growth of the city.
Detailed Features
Water Supply Subproject
4.04      The water supply subproject comprises:
3
(i) construction of a 7,500 m water storage tank in Ciudad Jardin
to improve water distribution in this sector;
(ii)  construction of the La Normal pumping station to convey treated
water from the low level distribution network to the high
level distribution network;
-(iii) installation of distribution network in the low income neighbor-
hoods; and purchase and installation of 20,000 house connections,
including water meters, and purchase of maintenance equipment.
Yumbo Subproject
4.05      The Yumbo subproject comprises:
(i) construction of a 12 km water transmission pipeline varying
from 24" to 30" in diameter to transport water from Cali
and to interconnect the water with the existing water distri-
bution network of the Municipality of Yumbo; and construction
of additional service pipes for connecting industrial consumers
along the route;
(ii)  rehabilitation of the existing water distribution system,
establishment of a leak detection and repair program,
pitometric investigations, installation of house water
meters.
4.06      In selecting the design criteria, the following alternatives were
studied: (i) construction of a system of wells and distribution system;
or (ii) utilization of the excess capacity of the Cali treatment plants by
bringing the water by pipeline. The first alternative was rejected because it
was higher in capital and operating costs than the second alternative for any
discount rate up to 22%. The construction of a pipeline utilizing Cali's
water production facilities is the least-cost solution, and is therefore
recommended.



- 22 -
4.07      Apart from the social merits of providing potable water to the resi-
dential community of Yumbo, and the possible incentives for future industrial
expansion with an assured supply of potable water, the proposed subproject is
also attractive on financial and technical grounds. Excess production capac-
ity already exists in Cali, so that the incremental costs of producing the
additional water will be negligible. On the technical side, the proposed
sub-project consists only of a transmission line; that for the residential
community will connect directly to an already existing distribution network,
and for the industrial community, will require only a small investment in
secondary distribution mains. Assurances were obtained during loan negotia-
tions that investments in the Yumbo Subproject will not be made until EMCALI
and the Municipality of Yumbo have entered into an agreement satisfactory to
the Bank under terms and conditions as described in paragraph 3.19, including
provisions requiring the connection to the transmission line of all new
industrial consumers under the jurisdiction of the Municipality of Yumbo
(Section 5.07(b), Loan Agreement).
Reforestation Subproject
4.08      The reforestation subproject comprises the purchase and planting
of about one million trees in the Cali, Canaveralejo and Pance River basins.
This is required to increase the water retention capacity of the surrounding
area. The subproject aims at regulating the run-off from these areas by
decreasing their peak flow and consequently decreasing the demands on the
existing drainage system.  Adequate legislation for forest conservation
already exists.
Cauca Interceptor Subproject
4.09      The Cauca Interceptor Subproject comprises:
(i)  Construction and installation of a 3.0 km, 0.45 m diameter
sewage collector to receive sewage from the zone of Ciudad
Jardin; construction and installation of a 2.1 km, 0.40 m
diameter sewage collector to receive sewage from the zone of
Ciudad Universitaria; construction and installation of a 5.4
km, 0.60-2.35 m diameter main sewage interceptor to receive
sewage from the two collectors, as well as from adjacent zones
in the southern and eastern parts of the city, and convey it by
gravity into a sewage pumping station;
(ii)  Constrlction of pumping facilities with an initial capacity of
2.64 m /sec, and construction and installation of a 2 km
pressure pipeline to convey sewage from the pumping station
to a point 300 m downstream from two existing water treatment
plants;
(iii)  Construction and installation of a 1.14 km; 1.0-1.20 m
diameter secondary sewage collector; and



- 23 -
(iv) Rehabilitation of two regulatory stormwater drainage lagoons,
which are silted and heavily polluted by sewage.
4.10      In selecting the design criteria, the following alternatives were
studied:
(i) moving the intake works for the water treatment plant upstream
from the sewage discharge point;
(ii) treating the sewage before it enters the river; and
(iii) constructing an interceptor.
Moving the intake works was rejected because of: (i) the high costs of con-
structing the pressure pipeline and operation and maintenance of the pumps;
and (ii) because large segments of the existing canals, particularly those
portions which traverse densely populated areas, would still have to be
protected from sewage discharges by the construction of a parallel interceptor
in order to eliminate the total sanitation problem. Construction of a sewage
treatment plant was eliminated because of (i) the high costs of constructing,
operating and maintaining the plant; and (ii) the costs of constructing an
alternative for the interception of sewage discharge to the existing drainage
canals that traverse the residential areas. The Cauca Interceptor subproject
is the least-cost solution at any positive discount rate.
Stormwater Subproject
4.11      The Stormwater Subproject comprises:
(i) Rehabilitation of 8.0 km of stormwater drainage canal (Canal
Sur); rehabilitation and reinforcement of the confluence of the
Ferrocarril, San Fernando and Canal Sur; and separation of storm-
water drainage between gravity discharge and pumping discharge;
(ii) Construction of about 22 km (0.20 m - 1.4 m diameter) of the storm-
water drainage network in various low income neighborhoods; and
(iii) Excavation and construction of 2.5 km of concrete-lined exten-
sion to the existing Napoles Canal; construction of confluences
to feeder lines;
Sanitary Sewers Subproject
4.12      The Sanitary Sewers Subproject comprises:
(i) Rehabilitation of old sewers; and
(ii) Construction of sewerage laterals and trunk lines in various
low income neighborhoods.



- 24 -
Other Proiect Components
4.13      These components comprise:
(i) Sewage and treatment studies to establish the degree and type of
treatment required to reduce the contamination of the Cauca River
to an acceptable level, and preparation of preliminary designs for
sewage treatment facilities.
(ii)  Purchase of equipment for maintaining the water, sewerage and
stormwater drainage systems.
(iii)  Engineering services for the detailed design and construction
supervision of the project.
Cost Estimates
4.14      The estimated cost of the project is US$25.7 million excluding
interest during construction of US$8 million. The table of cost estimates
is shown in Annex 4, and includes:
(i) 10% of construction costs for engineering and administration;
(ii) 15% of base costs for physical contingencies; and
(iii)  16% of the 1977 US$ Project Cost for price escalations
and exchange corrections.
4.15      Base cost estimates were prepared by consultants in June 1975, and
were updated to price levels of June 30, 1977 after verification by direct
inquiries of civil works contractors and equipment manufacturers.
4.16      The project contains an estimated 240 man-months of consulting
services to assist in the preparation of engineering drawings, specifica--
tions, bidding procedures, and construction supervision. The estimated
cost of these services, in prices of June 1977, is US$1.2 million, or an
average cost per man-month of US$5,000. The designs for the Cauca Interceptor
and Yumbo Transmission Line have been already awarded to Hidrosan-Inca and
Inesco Ltda, Colombian consultants that were found to be acceptable to the
Bank.
Financing
4.17      The foreign exchange requirements amount to US$13.8 million including
US$2.4 million interest during construction. The Bank loan would finance the
full foreign exchange requirements of the project. The Government of Colombia
has agreed to provide or cause to be provided financing in the amount of
US$11.4 million equivalent and the balance would come from the internal
resources of EMCALI. The Bank loan includes interest during construction which
is justified because of EMCALI's cash flow position. Despite water supply
tariffs well in excess of incremental cost (para. 6.06), and the recovery of
a substantial share of investment through betterment levies (para. 5.11),



- 25 -
which will enable it to cover 41% of its requirements through internally
generated funds, EMCALI faces a tight financial situation during the project's
construction period. The emphasis of the proposed project on sanitation (59%
of the project's total cost corresponds to the sewerage component), means that
a large share of EMCALI's incremental investments will produce no significant
receipts from operations. In addition, the gradual utilization of the excess
water production capacity from the Puerto Mallarino Plant which was due to an
overestimation of water demand growth (para. 2.18), means that the incre-
mental volume of water sold from the plant will not produce enough revenues to
cover the debt service payment related to the first project.
Implementation
4.18      The project would be carried out by EMCALI.  Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that EMCALI, to the extent that would be required by the
Bank, would employ engineering consultants satisfactory to the Bank in the pre-
paration of detailed designs of the project, the supervision of the carrying
out of the project, and the carrying out of the sewage treatment studies

CHAPTER V
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Finances - Consolidated Overview
5.01      In recent years EMCALI's overall financial position has been poor
and despite substantial increases in water and sewerage and power tariffs in
1975 and 1976, EMCALI was unable to generate sufficient funds to reverse the
erosion of its finances which had taken place during the 1972-74 period. To
cover its debt service requirements, working capital needs and the large
contributions required to finance new works, on which there were sizeable cost
overruns, EMCALI resorted to heavy medium-term borrowing at high rates of
interest, and by the end of 1976 had taken up Col$ 540 million (US$15 million)
for these purposes. Of this amount, Col$ 327 million was related to the water
and sewerage division, Col$ 142 million to the power division, and Col$71
million to the telephone division. In addition to the bank loans, water and
sewerage owed the power and telephone divisions Col$ 198 million. Despite
these borrowings, EMCALI's overall liquid position as of December 31, 1976
stood at less than one month's cash operating expenses:  this is below the
required minimum to meet day-to-day expenses. A summary balance sheet as of
December 31, 1976 analyzing water and sewerage, power and telephones is shown
below. The finances of each division are discussed in subsequent paragraphs.

- 30 -
5.02      EMCALI's poor overall operating performance for the period 1972-76
mainly resulted from higher operating expenses due to the higher than
anticipated rates of inflation, lower than anticipated water sales and the
failure to implement timely and adequate tariff increases. Consolidated net
income which was Col$ 70 million in 1973 decreased to Col$ 59 million in 1974.
Some improvement was shown in 1975 and 1976 when, following tariff increases,
net income was Col$ 78 million and Col$ 92 million respectively. However,
these earnings were totally inadequate to meet EMCALI's overall requirements.
An analysis of the results shows that, while on average, the power rates of
return were generally in line with the covenanted targets, after 1972, the
water and sewerage and telephone divisions consistently failed to meet their
covenanted rates of return by considerable margins. The under-mentioned
tables are indicative:

/1   Fixed assets have been revalued using the cost-of-living index, as
required under Loan 682-CO.
Banking and Funds Flow
5.03      EMCALI views the utility as a single public sector enterprise and
maintains one bank account covering all three divisions. Under this arrange-
ment the internally generated funds from one division can be used to support
the others, and therefore help the enterprise meet its overall financial
objectives. The power division, for example, has traditionally produced a
cash surplus, a portion of which has been transferred to the other divisions--
mainly the water and sewerage division. The financing plans assume that
the cash generated by all three divisions would in future be reinvested
in their respective investment programs. Correspondingly, the future tariff
levels and investment program for each division have been structured so that
water and sewerage, power and telephones are on a self-financing basis.
Although the power and telephone divisions took up loans and are currently
paying debt service, ostensibly on the amounts transferred to the water and



- 31 -
sewerage division, EMCALI decided that the amounts owing by the water
and sewerage division to the power and telephone divisions would be can-
celled effective June 30, 1977, the justification being that while it would
be difficult to implement appropriate water tariffs (paragraph 6.06) or
obtain the amounts through general taxation, there was scope for indirect
taxation through the power and telephone divisions, whose main source of
revenues are from the higher income groups and business community. Assurances
were obtained during loan negotiations that: (i) effective June 30, 1977,
EMCALI would only permit the use of funds of one operating division by another
if those funds are surplus to the operational, debt service, and investment
requirements of the transferring division; futhermore (ii) any transferred
funds would be treated as a loan from the transferring division on commercial
borrowing terms and conditions (Section 5.08, Loan Agreement).
Water and Sewerage Department
Past Finances
5.04      The water and sewerage division was mainly responsible for EMCALI's
poor overall financial performance during the 1972-75 period. The financial
performance of the division fell considerably short of all targets: water
sales (paragraph 2.18) were lower than anticipated; following inflation
operating expenses were higher than expected; tariff increases were delayed
and insufficient. Furthermore, the cost of improvements to the water and
sewerage system considerably exceeded the original estimates; the first
Bank-financed project alone sustained cost overruns of US$19 million (para-
graph 2.15). As a result, it was impossible for EMCALI to finance its 30%
share of the first project and, in fact, during the 1972-76 period, net
internally generated funds accounted for only 13% of total investment costs.
Furthermore, since EMCALI could not secure additional government or external
financing to cover the cost overruns, the entire burden fell on the internal
resources of the enterprise. Although the power and telephone divisions
contributed Col$ 141 million during the 1972-76 period to help finance the
deficits, the amounts were insufficient, and the balance was financed by a
build-up of suppliers credits, contractors accounts and borrowings from local
banks (paragraph 5.01). Despite these borrowings, as of December 31, 1976,
the water and sewerage division had overdrawn its bank accounts.
Tariffs
5.05      Water tariffs for domestic consumption are structured so that higher
income groups bear a larger proportion of the costs. This is accomplished
through 13 progressive rate categories, with each rate category related to a
progressively higher range of property assessment values. Each rate category
has a fixed monthly minimum, and additional charges are levied for consumption
over that amount. Water and sewerage charges are in the range of 4-5% of the
salaries of the lower-income groups. Of the total consumption within each
category, about 60% is subject to an excess consumption surcharge. From



- 32 -
January 1, 1976, water rates have been increased by 1.5% per month on excess
consumption. Assurances were obtained during loan negotiations that the rates
would continue to increase monthly, automatically, and at the current rates
stated above until December 31, 1981 (Section 5.04(a), Loan Agreement). Water
tariffs for industrial users are based on actual consumption. The sewerage
tariff is proportionately fixed at 60% of the water bill. The tariff structure
is acceptable. All areas connected to the Cali water system are subject to
the same uniform tariff structure which is shown in Annex 3, and would include
the Municipality of Yumbo, to be connected under the proposed project.
5.06      Additional revenues would be obtained from a program of reassessment
of property values, started in early 1977, which moves the affected proper-
ties into higher rate categories. The reassessment is complete and is
gradually being applied to water and sewer charges over three years. About
20% of the properties affected have already entered the billing cycle. The
new assessment would generate not less than Col$ 340 million in additional
water and sewerage revenues during the 1978-81 period. Assurances were
obtained during loan negotiations that the program of reassessment of property
values would be fully brought into the billing cycle by June 30, 1979 (Section
5.04(b), Loan Agreement). This would be closely monitored during supervision
missions.
5.07      The net effect of the combined measures--automatic monthly tariff
increases and higher property assessments--would be to raise average water and
sewerage tariffs by 22% in 1977, 28% in 1978, 15% in 1979, 10% in 1980, and
13% in 1981. Further minor increases are required to meet the rate of return
covenant (pjragraph 5.14). The average tariff inciuding sewerage was
Col$ 3.60 m  in 1976, and 3would reach Col$ 8.64 m/ , in current prices, by the
end of 1981 or Col$4.50/m in 1977 prices compared with a tariff of Col$4.40
in 1977.
Financing Plan
5.08      Looking forward, the capital requirements of the water and sewerage
division during the 1978-81 period total US$42.9 million. This amount includes
the .proposed project of US$33.7 million, improvements to existing systems of
US$2.1 million, and an increase in working capital of US$7.1 million. About
half of this amount is required to finance higher inventory levels due to
inflation, while the balance is required to restore EMCALI's liquidity posi-
tion. About 41% of the requirements would be financed from net internally
generated funds: 26% from loans; 31% from the proposed Bank loan, and 2% from
contributions. The proposed Bank loan of US$13.8 million would finance all
the foreign exchange costs of the project, including interest and other
charges on the Bank loan during construction.
5.09      The following summarizes the cost of the project, the additional
funds r-cuired during the period of execution, and the sources of funds:

/1   Includes Col$ 587 million betterment levy revenues (paragraph 5.11).
5.10      To protect the financing plan and EMCALI's future financial viabil-
ity, assurances were also obtained during loan negotiations that EMCALI
will not undertake without the agreement of the Bank any investments in the
water and sewerage division during the period of execution of the proposed
project, if the aggregate cost of all its investments in excess of those
agreed to in paragraph 5.09 exceed US$1 million in any year (Section 5.07(a),
Loan Agreement), nor would it in the future incur any new long-term debt for
water and and sewerage without the Bank's agreement, unless the net revenues
before betterment levies, interest and depreciation for the fiscal year next
preceding such incurrence or for a later 12-month period ended prior to such
incurrence, whichever amount is the greater, shall be not less than 1.3 times
the maximum debt service requirements for any succeeding fiscal year on all
debt, including the debt proposed to be incurred (Section 5.06, Loan Agreement).
Special Aspects of the FinancinR Plan
5.11      In Colombia, as in some other countries, certain investment costs
are recovered through a betterment levy (impuesto de valorizacion) imposed
on the presumed beneficiaries of public infrastructure. Such levies have
been particularly successful in Colombia, especially for urban road and



- 34 -
sewerage systems construction. EMCALI proposes to charge and collect in four
annual installments not less than Col$ 587 million (about US$11.5 million)
during the 1978-81 period and Col$ 203 million (about US$4.1 million) during
the period 1982-84 through such levies for certain works included in the
project. This would represent about 50% of the total cost of the project,
including interest during construction. Assurances were obtained during
loan negotiations that betterment levies would be charged and collected, in
the proportions and under the terms stated below for each subproject (Section
5.09, Loan Agreement). Disbursements of the Bank loan on account of expen-
ditures for each subproject in respect to which valorizacion must be collected
will be made only after the Bank receives satisfactory evidence that all neces-
sary authorization and approvals required to charge and collect valorizacion
in respect of such works shall have been obtained (schedule 1, para. 4 Loan
Agreement).

5.12      To complete the financing plan, in addition to the Bank loan, EMCALI
proposes to obtain in the form of two additional loans Col$ 600 million in
counterpart financing. They include:
(i)  a loan from the National Government of Col$ 300 million
amortized over 20 years with 4 years of grace at an annual
interest rate of 16%;  The proceeds of the loan will be with-
drawn during the period 1978-81;
(ii)  a loan from the Banco Central de Hipotecario of Col$ 300
million amortized over 10 years with 2 years of grace at
an annual interest rate of 24%. The proceeds of the loan 2il1
be withdrawn under the same terms and conditions as the one
above.
5.13      Assurances were obtained during loan negotiations that the counter-
part funds would be provided under the terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank. The loans would be received in accordance with the schedulz belcv.
The Bank loan will only become effective after EMCALI obtains these loans on
terms and conditions, including the schedule of disbursement, satisfactory t'-
the Bank (Section 8.01(a), Loan Agreement).

Financial Covenants
5.14      Present forecasts indicate that the water and sewerage department
would need to achieve the following annual rates of return on its net revalued
fixed assets in operation: 3% during the 1978-81 period; 4% in 1982; 4.5% in
1983, and 5% in 1984 and thereafter. To achieve these rates, EMCALI would
need to raise the average tariff, in addition to that already agreed (para.
5.05), by a further 4% in each of the years 1978 and 1979, which is not
considered a major constraint. Assurances were therefore obtained during loan
negotiations that tariffs for 1978 and up to and including 1981, would be at
least sufficient to generate a financial rate of return of 3.0%, increasing to
4% in 1982, 4.5% in 1983, and 5% in 1984 and thereafter, on the revalued cost
less accumulated depreciation of revenue producing fixed assets in service in
any fiscal year (Section 5.05(a), Loan Agreement). Assurances were also
obtained during loan negotiations that the existing methodology would continue
to be used to revalue fixed assets (Schedule 5, para. 5, Loan Agreement).
5.15      Despite the substantial tariff increases, the financial rate of
return during the 1978-81 period would be considerably lower than the 8.0%
covenanted for the same period in the previous Loan Agreement 682-CO: the
latter was based on a much higher estimate of the volume of water sold
(paragraph 2.18) and it is no longer reasonable to expect that EMCALI can
reach this target in the foreseeable future. In addition to being more
realistic, the lower rate of return now proposed is acceptable for the
following reasons:
(i) The covenanted annual financial rates of return will require
EMCALI to set up tariffs at levels above the estimated average
incremental cost of water supply (para. 6.06). Besides,
tariffs far above the average incremental cost of water would
discourage consumption while significant idle capacity exists
in the Puerto Mallarina treatment plant;
(ii) The proposed 3% rate of return target would generate
sufficient funds to cover future debt service requirements,
working capital needs, and the contributions needed to
finance new works. An 8% rate of return on the new rate base
would require further significant tariff increases during the
1978-81 period and given present tariff levels (paragraph



- 36 -
6.06), this would not be appropriate and would only serve to
generate excess cash estimated at Col$ 522 million (US$10
million).
(iii)  Unlike other water utilities in Latin America, EMCALI also
acts as a conduit through which the Municipality of Cali
raises additional funds. A tax of 4% on gross water and
sewerage, telephones and power revenues is collected by
EMCALI. In addition, the water and sewerage division
absorbs the cost of maintaining city parks, which have
traditionally been treated as operating costs in the rate of
return computations.
5.16      Taking into account municipal taxes and park maintenance, EMCALI's
forecast financial rate of return would be of the order of 5% for the 1978-81
period, increasing to about 7% by the end of 1984, which is among the highest
rates achieved in the sector in Latin America.
Future Finances
5.17      On the basis of the proposed tariffs, revenues should more than double
from an estimated Col$ 379 million for 1977 to Col$ 906 million during 1981.
The estimated operating expenses include additional amounts for the expected
higher level of activity as well as for general price increases. The projec-
tions also include the additional revenues and expenses that would result from
connecting Yumbo to EMCALI's system.  The operating ratio before depreciation
would remain at about 57% throughout the period, which is considered acceptable.

5.18      On the basis of the foregoing the financial structure and liquidity
position of the water and sewerage department would become substantially
stronger over the next 5 years. As shown by the figures below, which are an
extract from Annex 5, the current ratio would be satisfactory throughout the
period. The debt/equity ratio would be 29/71 at the end of 1981 which would
be acceptable.

Power Department
Past Finances and Present Position
5.19      The power division has averaged over the last few years a rate of
return higher than that to which EMCALI had committed itself to the Bank
(paragraph 5.02), and has always produced a cash operating surplus. However,
EMCALI has weakened the liquidity of the power division by permitting the
uncontrolled transfer of funds to the water and sewerage division, so much so,
that in order to maintain its liquidity, the power division had to take up
medium-term bank loans. As at December 31, 1976 these loans stood at Col$ 142
million (paragraph 5.01).
Future Investments and Financing Plan
5.20      Effective January 1, 1976 automatic monthly tariff increases of 2.2%
per month were implemented. This will raise the average power tariff by about
30% per year during the 1978-81 period. Unlike the water and sewerage division,
no investment in production facilities is required since EMCALI buys its power
in bulk from a regional supplier. The power department proposes to finance most
of its investment program through internally generated funds. Assurances were
obtained during loan negotiations that the power rates would continue to
increase monthly, automatically, and at the current rates of increase stated
above until June 30, 1979 (Section 5.05(ii)a, Loan Agreement).



- 38 -
5.21      Looking forward, the capital requirements of the power department
during the 1978-81 period total US$15.2 million. This amount covers extensions
and improvements to the existing systems estimated to cost US$8.3 million,
and will require an increase in working capital of US$6.9 million. About 90%
of the requirements would be financed from net internally generated funds
and 10% from contributions and other sources. The following summarizes the
cost of the proposed investments, the additional funds required during the
period of execution, and the sources of funds:

Financial Covenants
5.22      The Power Department's investment program could eventually be
expanded, if necessary, without jeopardizing its financial viability since
the cost of the present program will be financed entirely by internally
generated funds and customers' contributions and since the indebtedness
capacity of the Department is rather large. On this basis, assurances were
obtained during loan negotiations that EMCALI would not undertake any invest-
ments in the Power Division in excess of US$30 million equivalent during the
execution of the proposed project (US$7.7 million in 1978, US$7.2 million in
1979, US$7.3 million in 1980, and US$7.8 million in 1981) that would exceed
in aggregate in any one year US$1 million without prior consent of the Bank
(Section 5.07(a), Loan Agreement), nor in the future would it incur any new
long-term debt for power without the Bank's agreement, unless the net revenues
before interest and depreciation for the fiscal year next preceding such in-
currence, whichever amount is the greater, shall be not less than 1.3 times
the maximum debt service requirements for any succeeding fiscal year on all
debt, including the debt proposed to be incurred (Section 5.06, Loan
Agreement).   In order to achieve its



- 39 -
objectives the power department would require a rate of return of 8% on its
net fixed assets. While EMCALI has already agreed to specific tariff increases
in the power division, assurances were obtained during loan negotiations that
tariffs would be at least sufficient to generate a financial rate of return of
not less than 8% of the revalued cost less accumulated depreciation of fixed
assets in service during any fiscal year (Section 5.05(a), Loan Agreement).
The net effect would be to raise the tariff, in addition to what EMCALI has
already agreed to, by an additional 4% in 1978 and 2% in 1979. Small tariff
increases such as these are not considered a major problem. Assurances were
also obtained during loan negotiations that the existing methodology would
continue to be used to revalue fixed assets (Schedule 5, para. 5, Loan Agree-
ment).
Future Finances
5.23      The earnings and cash flow of the power department should be favor-
able during the 1978-81 period. Revenues will quadruple throughout the
period from Col$ 1,000 million to Col$ 4,032 million. Expenses are expected
to increase consistent with the general price increases. As shown by the
figures below, the operating ratio before depreciation will gradually increase
from 85% in 1977 to 92% in 1981. This is the result of additional increases
in the cost of bulk power, a portion of which EMCALI is absorbing. The rate
of return would remain steady at 8%.

financial projections in Annex 6, the financial structure and liquidity
position of the power department would become substantially stronger over the
next 5 years. The current ratio would be acceptable throughout the period.
The debt/equity ratio would only be 3/97 at the end of 1981. Debt service
coverage would be satisfactory.

of return equal to that to which EMCALI had committed itself to the Bank
(paragraph 5.02). This has resulted in cash deficits during the 1973-76
period. In addition, the telephone division transferred about Col$ 50 million
to the water and sewerage division during the 1972-76 period. Like the
other divisions, the telephone division took up medium-term bank loans, which
at December 31, 1976 stood at Col$ 71 million, and delayed settlement of its
creditors. These arrangements did not prevent the division from having an
unsatisfactory cash posit*on as of the end of 1976. The telephone department
owes the Bank's borrower TELECOM, the national long distance entity, about
Col$ 160 million (about US$4.4 million) as of September 30, 1977 for bills
which it has collected from subscribers on behalf of TELECOM and has failed
to remit. TELECOM needs these funds for its own expansion under Bank loan
1073-CO. EMCALI has agreed with TELECOM to pay back its outstanding debts
to this entity in 10 equal monthly installments starting March 1978, including
interest, guaranteed by a local bank. This guarantee will also apply to
monthly bills to be collected by EMCALI on behalf of TELECOM during 1978.
Future Investment and Financing Plan
5.26      Effective May, 1976, telephone rates for local calls were increased
from Col$ 0.10 per impulse to Col$ 0.16; effective October 1, 1977, they were
increased to Col$ 0.25 per impulse and will be automatically increased to



- 41 -
Col$0.30 per impulse on December 31, 1977. At the same time, an application
is before the authorities for an increase in TELECOM's long-distance rates,
which should result in an increase in EMCALI's participation. In addition
to the measures described above, assurances were obtained during loan negoti-
ations (Section 8.01(b), Loan Agreement) that all steps would be taken,
including the appropriate Resolucion of EMCALI's Board of Directors and by
the Junta Nacional de Tarifas del Departamento de Planeacion to enable EMCALI
to increase its tariffs for telephone services during 1978, so as to obtain
the annual rate of return for 1978 provided for in paragraph 5.28. This was
specified as an additional condition of effectiveness. Looking forward, the
capital requirements of the telephones department during the 1978-81 period
total US$52.9 million (US$11.9 million in 1978, US$17.5 million in 1979,
US$17.0 million in 1980, and US$6.6 million in 1981). EMCALI plans a major
increase in telephone service and expects to install about 38,000 telephones
during the 1978-81 period. This would raise the population served from 61%
at the end of 1977 to 84% by the end of 1981. To meet this target additional
investments of US$49.2 million and an increase in working capital of US$3.7
million would be required. About 24% of the requirements would be financed
by net internally generated funds, 29% from customers' deposits and other
contributions, and 47% from medium term suppliers credits. The following
summarizes the cost of the proposed investments, the additional funds
required during the period of execution, and the sources of funds.

Financial Covenants
5.27      To protect the financing plan and EMCALI's future financial viability,
assurances were obtained during loan negotiations that EMCALI would not under-
take any investments in the telephone division in excess of those specified in
paragraph 5.26 during the execution of of the proposed project that would



- 42 -
exceed in aggregate in any one year US$1 million without prior consent of the
Bank, (Section 5.07(a), Loan Agreement) nor would it in the future incur any
new medium or long-term debt without the Bank's agreement, unless the net
revenues before interest and depreciation for the fiscal year next preceding
such incurrence or for a later 12-month period ended prior to such incurrence,
whichever amount is the greater, shall be not less than 13 times the maximum
debt service requirements for any succeeding fiscal year on all debt, includ-
ing the debt proposed to be incurred (Section 5.06, Loan Agreement).
5.28      While EMCALI has already agreed to specific tariff increases in
the telephone department, assurances were obtained during loan negotiations
that tariffs would be at least sufficient to generate a rate of return not
less than 5.5% in 1978, increasing to 8.0% in 1979 and thereafter on net
revalued fixed assets in service (Section 5.05(a), Loan Agreement). This
would require substantial tariff increases in addition to those already agreed
to. Assurances were also obtained during loan negotiations that the existing
methodology would continue to be used to revalue fixed assets (Schedule 5,
para. 5, Loan Agreement).
5.29      The earnings and cash flow should be favorable during the 1978-81
period. Revenues will more than triple during the period from Col$ 193
million to Col$ 730 million. Expenses are expected to increase consistent
with the increased level of operations and the general price increases. The
operating ratio will gradually decrease from 91.1% to 74.1%. This is the
result of tariff increases and economies of scale due to an increased volume
of business.
Future Finances
5.30      As shown by the figures below, which are an extract from the detailed
financial projections in Annex 7, the financial structure and liquid position
of the telephone division would also become substantially stronger over the
next 5 years. The current position would be acceptable throughout the period,
although it could be tight in 1979. The debt/equity ratio would be 28/72 in
1981, which would still leave a margin for further borrowing.

of 1981 would be 26/74. The consolidated weighted average rate of return on
overall revalued fixed assets will average about 5.5%.

suggested by the Bank (Section 3.04(b), Loan Agreement). During supervision
missions, EMCALI's performance will be discussed with its staff and evaluated

CHAPTER VI
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Summary
6.01      The overall program consists of six subprojects, as well as two
smaller components: sewage treatment studies and the purchase of maintenance
equipment. The internal economic rate of return of the project is estimated
at 22%. Of the six subprojects, the Cauca subproject, the Stormwater sub-
project and the Sanitary Sewers subproject are interrelated. The estimated
aggregate internal economic rate of return for these subprojects is 21%; these
subprojects, the cost of which is US$13.0 million, account for 59% of the
total project cost. The estimated internal economic rate of return of the
Yumbo subproject is 13%, the cost of which is US$4.0 million, and represents
18% of the total project cost. The estimated incremental rate of return as a
proxy for the internal economic rate of return of the Cali Water Supply
subproject is 36%. The cost of this subproject is US$3.2 million, or 14% of
the total project cost. This high rate of return reflects the low marginal
costs compared to average tariffs, since considerable excess water production
capacity currently exists. Internal economic rates of return were not computed
for the following subprojects because of the predominance of non-quantifiable
factors, but there is strong evidence that the incremental benefits of the
services provided by these subprojects are high: (i) the Reforestation sub-
project; (ii) Sewage Treatment studies; and (iii) Maintenance Equipment.
The cost of these subprojects, for which no quantitative economic analysis was
carried out, amounts to US$1.9 million, or 9% of total project cost. All
costs include engineering and administration, and physical contingencies, but
exclude price escalation and interest during construction.
Population Benefited
6.02      The proposed project will be concentrated in areas which have an
above average concentration of urban poor, or low provision and access to
services, including poor environmental conditions. The project would benefit
directly about 250,000 people, of whom 180,000 or about 70% are among the
urban poor earning less than US$150 per capita per year and who are among the
poorest 40% of the country. In addition, about 160,000 people of whom about
45% or 70,000 are also among the urban poor will benefit through water house
connections. A major feature of the program is the reduction of contamination
levels of the Cauca River at the intakes of two existing water treatment
plants. Presently, the contamination levels are 500 times greater than normal
health standards allow. The two water treatment plants supply about 85% of
the total potable water of the city, affecting virtually the entire population.
Internal Economic Rate of Return
Sewerage Subprojects
6.03      The Cauca, Stormwater and Sanitary Sewers subprojects are all inter-
related, so that an aggregate internal economic rate of return was calculated
for the combined total. The subprojects, which aim at improving the living
conditions and social opportunities of the people, have benefits well beyond



- 46 -
those that can be measured directly through the tariff structure. Consequently,
externalities such as improved physical and environmental conditions were quan-
tified through increased land values. However, intangible benefits such as
overall improvements in public health and labor productivity were excluded.
The sewerage subprojects presented a positive net present value for any dis-
count rate up to 21%. This high return indicates that a substantial part
of the costs can be recuperated through taxation on increased land values and
still leave additional benefits to the property owners. To this end EMCALI
will charge a valorization tax that will recover about 45% of the subproject
cost (paragraph 5.11). The costs and benefits are shown in the following table:

6.04     In computing the benefits, improvements to the physical and
environmental conditions were relatively easy to measure, since they are
normally reflected in an increase in land values. In this connection, the
benefits were estimated for both the land that is presently urbanized in or
near the project zones, and also the land that has been earmarked for future
development. The methodology is outlined as follows:
(i)  Increase in land values in existing populated areas.
Areas presently subjected to frequent flooding will experience
an immediate increase in the land values once the problem
has been eliminated.  For the purpose of the computations in
the preceding table, the increase in values was assumed to
reflect other intangible benefits such as a diminution of
health hazards and an improvement in the aesthetic conditions.
No other benefits were quantified. The increase in land
values was estimated by comparing present land values in
areas subject to flooding with similar and nearby areas free
of flooding. The estimated increase in values was conservative;



- 47 -
(ii)   Increase in land values in areas earmarked for future expansion.
One of the objectives of the proposed project is to improve land
use. In order to achieve this, certain areas of the southern
part of the city presently not suitable for urbanization will
t- upgraded.  The attendant increase in the  land values for
this area was estimated to be equal to the difference in the
value of this land as compared with similar land not subject
to flooding, and also without similar infrastructure components.
Fluctuations in market conditions as a result of these improve-
ments were evened out by reflecting the increases over a 10
year period. In the same way, it was assumed that real estate
sales in the new areas would be proportionate to the population
growth, and that the market would not be artificially manipulated
by either dumping large tracts of land, or on the other hand,
by withholding land from the market in anticipation of further
price increases.
Yumbo Subproject
6.05         The tariff structure  of Yumbo will be the same as Cali.   Accordingly,
the appropriate average tariff for domestic and industrial consumption as well
as increases in the non-urbanized land values were used as a proxy for economic
benefits. The increase was reflected during the 1981-84 period to coincide
with other improvements, which would result in an almost immediate increase in
the market value of land. Other benefits, such as overall health improvements,
were not quantified.  The estimated IERR is 13%.  The cost benefits are shown
in the following figures:

Cali Water Supply Subproject
6.06      The average incremental cost for the Cali3Water Supply Subproject, at
an 11% discounted rate, is estimated at Col$ 1.47/m in prices of June 1977.
While this cost is higher than the average tariff for the lowest income  3
consumers, it is still lower than the average water tariff of Col$ 2.55/m for
the city as a whole. This indicates that on a resource allocation basis, the
water is overpriced. However, the large spread is necessary to cover the
debt service of past investments, which is mostly being absorbed by the higher
income groups. This has resulted in an incremental rate of return of 36%.
The incremental costs and volumes of water are shown in the following table:

Sensitivity Analysis
Sewerage Subprojects
6.07      A sensitivity analysis for the internal economic rate of return on
the sewerage subprojects shows that a positive net present value would still
be achieved at any discount rate up to 11% - estimated opportunity cost of
capital in Colombia - even if:
(i)  construction costs were 35% higher than estimated; or
(ii)  increase in land values in already urbanized areas was
53% lower than estimated; or
(iii)  increase in non-urbanized land values was 44% lower
than estimated.



- 49 -
6.08      Construction costs are not likely to significantly increase - in
constant prices - over estimates, since they (i) include a high civil works
component which by its nature is not subject to wide fluctuations; and
(ii) already include 15% for physical contingencies which is considered
adequate for the nature of the works involved.
6.09      Increase in land values have been projected based on actual evidence
from similar areas of the city. The new land that would be made available
for urbanization may have a negative impact on the value of already urbanized
areas. However, this impact, although not predictable, is unlikely to offset
a major part of the project benefits in vacant land.
Yumbo Subproject
6.10      A sensitivity analysis for the internal economic rate of return on
the Yumbo subproject shows that 11% would still be achieved even if:
Mi)  construction costs were 11% higher than projected; or
(ii)  operating costs were 24% higher than projected; or
(iii)  increase in land values was 20% lower than projected; or
(iv) revenues from tariffs or the volume of water sold were 12%
lower than projected.
6.11      Construction and operating costs are not likely to be higher than
projected - in constant prices - due to the relative simplicity of the works
involved. Increase in land values projections corresponds to a minimum estimate
and is likely to be higher.
6.12      If revenues from tariffs turn out to be lower than projected--in
constant prices--a subsequent low internal economic rate of return would
indicate the inadequacy of water tariffs, rather than that the investment was
not justified. Demand projections have been based on historical data and on
a survey on existing industries (paragraph 3.20), and the risk of significant
deviation from these projections is considered minimal.
Risks
6.13      The project is technically feasible and offers limited risk.  The
only risk is that the project may not be implemented in the time proposed if
EMCALI, because of inaction on further rate increases, will be unable to
mobilize the required local currency resources. Given the assurances obtained
from EMCALI that rate increases and betterment levies will be implemented in a
timely fashion, and, more importantly, the general acceptance of the need to
strengthen EMCALI's finances, it is expected that the project will be carried
out in the intended period.



- 50 -
6.14      Frequent changes in the position of General Manager contributed
significantly to difficulties encountered by EMCALI in the recent past. The
current General Manager, who was appointed in 1975, is competent and is able
to count on an experienced second level of management that has undergone
little change.
Environmental Implications
6.15      The change of the point of discharge of sewage inside the limits of
the city of Cali does not noticeably change the Cauca River's condition down-
stream of the town. On the other hand, the discharge of raw sewage does not
pose an urgent problem since cities located downstream from Cali do not use
the Cauca River as a source of water.
6.16      The project provides for studies to establish the degree and type
of sewage treatment required to reduce contamination of the Cauca River on
the basis of standards to be applied by the Cauca River Authority (CVC) which
is responsible for river quality (para. 4.13 (i)).

CHAPTER VII
AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During loan negotiations assurances were obtained that:
(a) EMCALI will, by June 30, 1978: (i) prepare a program satis-
factory to the Bank for the improvement of its management
information budgeting, internal auditing procedures and
strengthening of the coordination of the administration
and operation of its division; and (ii) to the extent that
would be required by the Bank, would employ consultants
whose qualifications, experience and terms of reference and
conditions of employment would be satisfactory to the Bank
to assist the borrower in carrying out the program (paras.
2.08, 2.09, 2.10 and 2.11);
(b) EMCALI's financial statements and accounts will be audited
by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank (para. 2.10);
(c) EMCALI will make investments in the Yumbo Subproject only
after reaching an agreement satisfactory to the Bank with
the Municipality of Yumbo on the terms and conditions under
which EMCALI will take over the operation, maintenance and
billing of Yumbo's water supply system; and that said
agreement will provide that new industries in Yumbo be
required to connect to the system (paras. 3.19, 4.07);
(d) EMCALI will, to the extent that would be required by the Bank,
employ engineering consultants to prepare the detailed designs
for the project and to assist it in the supervision of construc-
tion (para. 4.18);
(e) EMCALI will place the supply and civil works contracts
of the project in accordance with an agreed schedule
(para. 4.19);
(f) EMCALI will transfer funds generated by any of its divisions
to another of its divisions only if the funds to be trans-
ferred are in excess of those required for the operations,
debt service, and investments of the division originating
the funds, and it will treat such transfers made after
June 30, 1977, as loans from one division to the other, on
commercial terms and conditions (para. 5.03);
(g) EMCALI's rates for water and sewerage and for power services
will continue to be increased automatically each month, at
the current rates of increase (paras. 5.05 and 5.20);
(h) EMCALI will fully implement the property reassessment program
by June 30, 1979 (para. 5.06);



- 52 -
(k) EMCALI's investments, other than those already agreed to,
for each of its divisions will not exceed, without the
Bank's concurrence, US$1 million in any year (paras. 5.10,
5.22 and 5.27);
(1) EMCALI would not incur long-term debt without the Bank's
concurrence, unless its net revenues before betterment levies,
interest and depreciation for the fiscal year next preceding
such incurrence or for a later 12-month period ended prior to
such incurrence, whichever amount is the greater, shall be not
be less than 1.3 times the maximum debt service requirements
for any succeeding fiscal year on all debt, including the debt
proposed to be incurred (paras. 5.10, 5.22 and 5.27);
(m)  EMCALI will charge and collect, for certain works in-
cluded in the project, not less than Col$ 587 million as
valorizacion during the 1978-1981 period and not less than
Col$ 203 million during the 1982-84 period (para. 5.11);
(n) EMCALI will obtain annually, starting in 1978, financial
rates of return as set forth in the appropriate paragraphs for
the water and sewerage division, the power division, and the
telephone division, based on the revalued cost less accumulated
depreciation of the fixed assets in service of each division
(paras. 5.14, 5.22 and 5.28);
(o) EMCALI's fixed assets will be revalued for all of its
divisions in accordance with methods satisfactory to the
Bank (paras. 5.14, 5.22 and 5.28);
(p) EMCALI will prepare quarterly reports and information
on the progress made in achieving the monitoring indices
(para. 5.32); and
7.02      The following condition of effectiveness were specified:
(a) that EMCALI enter into arrangements with the Government and
Banco Central Hipotecario for the Col$ 300 million to be made
available by each of them to EMCALI on terms and conditions,
including a schedule of disbursements, satisfactory to the
Bank (para. 5.13); and
(b) that EMCALI increase its tariffs for telephone services during
1978 so as to obtain the specified rate of return for 1978
(para. 5.26).



- 53 -
7.03      The following condition of disbursement was specified:
A condition of disbursement for each sub-project in respect
of which valorizacion would be collected would be that the
Bank receives satisfactory evidence that all necessary
authorizations and approvals required to charge and collect
valorizacion in respect of such works shall have been obtained
(para. 5.11).
7.04      Provided the foregoing conditions are met, the proposed project would
be suitable for a Bank loan of US$13.8 million. The loan would be for 17 years,
including a grace period of four years and US$200,000 retroactive financing for
consultant expenditures incurred after June 30, 1977.
