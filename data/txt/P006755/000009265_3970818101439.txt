PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COLOMBIA: SECOND CALI WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
(LOAN 1523-CO)
PREFACE
This is a project completion report of the Second Cali Water Sup-
ply and Sewerage Project, for which Loan 1523-CO was approved in February
1978 in the amount of US$13.8 million. The Loan was closed in October 1982
after cancellation of US$5.76 4llion.
The Project Completion Rjm',ort (PCR) was prepared by the Latin
America and Caribbean Projects Der.&rtment on the basis of the findings of
a July 1983 mission, documents contained in regional files and information
provided by Bank staff involved during various stages of the project cycle.
The Borrower (Cali Municipal Enterprises - EMCALI) was most helpful in
providing information. The Borrower's opinion on the project experience
is attached as Annex 11.
In accordance with the revised procedures, for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Onerations Evaluation Department
COED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following normal procedures, OED sent a copy of the draft report
to the Government and the Borrower for their comments, but none were
received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COLOMBIA: SECOND CALI WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
(LOAN 1523-CO)
HIGHLIGHTS
This project was the second Bank-financed operation in the sec-
tor in Cali.   The project included water supply, sewerage and drainage
works in Cali, Colombia's third largest city, and Yumbo, an industrial
center to the north of Cali.  A primary objective was to strengthen the
Borrower's (Cali Municipal Enterprises - EMCALI) management and its finan-
cial position.
Project execution proceeded more slowly than anticipated in the
overly optimistic schedule prepared at appraisal. The delays began in the
early stages of execution with managerial/staffing problems (para. 3.03),
compounded by technical difficulties  (Annex  4)  and, most importantly,
EKCALI's continuously poor financial performance.
ENCALI 'S financial problems became evident during execution of
the first Bank-financed water and sewerage project (Loan 682-CO, US$18.5
million, approved May 26, 1970; para. 1.07) and continued throughout the
life of the second project. A major factor in EMCALI's poor financial per-
formance was the political pressure which offset measures designed to
improve EMCALI's position, (para. 9.03). Other factors were slow growth in
demand, high inflation and difficulties in collecting betterment levies.
In mid-1979, EMCALI arranged for a loan from the Euro-Latin
American Bank, guaranteed by local banks in return for a revenue pledge,
and requested that the Bank waive its negative pledge rights. The Bank
decided to use granting the waiver to cause EMCALI to improve its finan-
ces.  Over the next three years, proposed Bank solutions met with little
success, leading to suspension of disbursements between January and
September 1981, and refusal to extend Loan closing beyond the original date
of June 30, 1982 (paras. 3.06-3.13). About 42% (US$5.76 million) of Loan
funds was cancelled.
The project was slightly less than 50% complete by the closing
date.   Two subprojects have been postponed indefinitely, but most other
works are scheduled for completion by end-1984. The last project component
is to be completed in 1986 (para. 3.05). This schedule is financially and
technically feasible (para. 9.01).
Population befitting from the project will be close to the number
estimated appraisal (para. 7.01).  An indicative estimate of the overall
internal financial rate of return is 21%, versus 22% estimated at appraisal
(paras. 7.03-7.04). But EMCALI remains financially troubled, and unable to
set realistic goals and achieve them.

SECOND CALI WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
The Project Area
1.01       The project was to finance water supply, sewerage and drainage
works in Cali and Yumbo, both located in the Cauca River valley.  Cali,
Colombia's third largest city, had an estimated population of over one mil-
lion In 1976, 20% of whom were urban poor.  The Municipality of Yumbo,
about 10 km north of Cali, is the area's Industrial center. Its 1976 popu-
lation was estimated at 32,400. Both cities had grown rapidly until 1975;
annual growth rates were expected to level off at 2.8% in Cali and 5% in
Yumbo during 1976-86.
The Sector
1.02       The Ministry of Public Health is in charge of overall sector
planning under the coordination of the Wational Plann--n  Department.  The
National Institute for Municipal Development (INSFOPAL), a decentralized
Government agency under the Ministry of Health, is in theory the principal
financial, coordinating and supervisory agency for water supply and sanita-
tion activities in urban areas.1/   In practice, however, INSFOPAL has
little or no influence on sector activities in the 21 major cities which
contain about 40% of the country's total population.   In these cities,
including Cali, water supply and sewerage services are provided by munici-
pal enterprises.   Many of these entities also provide such services as
power, telecommunications and solid waste disposal.
Service Levels
1.03      Cali is served by one treatment plant which draws water from the
Cali River and two which draw water from the Cauca River. At appraisal,
96% of Cali's population was connected to the water supply system. Indus-
trial users in Yumbo were not connected to a public water supply system and
only 60% of residential demand was being met. Yumbo's distribution system
was in poor repair, largely because the municipality had been unable to
finance an adequate maintenance program.
1/ Cities with more than 2,500 inhabitants.



1.04      About 80% of Cali's population was connected to the sewerage sys-
tem at appraisal, but service was so poor as to pose a health hazard.  Con-
centration of population growth in the southern part of the city overloaded
tb- com.ined stormwater drainage and sanitary sewage system, ard caused
sewage to back up into open stormwater drainage canals. In addition, about
200,000 people living in the south and southwest discharged raw sewage into
an open stormwater drainage canal that crcossed a densely populated area.
Raw sewage from another 200,000 Inhabitants in the southern and southwest-
ern parts of the city was discharged directly into a stormwater drainage
canal which flowed into the Cauca River upstream from the Intake for the
two water treatment plants.
The Borrower and Executing Agency
1.05       The Borrower and executing agency is Municipal Enterprises of
Cali (ENCALI), a decentralized municipal agency responsible for administra-
tion, construction and maintenance of water supply, sewerage, power distri-
bution and telephone facilities in Cali. At appraisal ENCALI was also res-
ponsible for power distribution and telephone services in Yumbo and had
agreed to provide water supply services as well. At appraisal, EMCALI had
about 2,500 employees, 988 of whom were assigned to the Water Supply and
Sewerage Department (WSD). With 7 employees/l,000 connections, EMCALI was
not overstaffed.
1.06      Although ENCALI's accounting practices and procedures were con-
sidered adequate, management information provided by the computerized
accounting system needed improvement.  Budget controls were weak.  There
was a need to strengthen coordination among departments.
1.07      EMCALI's most serious problems were financial, mainly because of
WSD's poor performance in 1972-75. The sources of WSD's financial diffi-
culties were:  (a) low water sales caused by slow growth In demand; (b)
high operating expenses caused by inflation; (c) delayed and insufficient
tariff increases; and (d) substantial cost overruns in improvements of the
water supply and sewerage system, particularly those financed under the
Bank-financed First Water Supply and Sewerage Project.2/ Despite substan-
tial transfers from the Power Department, large tariff increases in late
1975 and heavy medium-term borrowings, WSD's financial performance con-
tinued to be poor. WSD had not complied with the rate of return covenant
under Loan 682-CO and was unable to contribute the agreed percentage of
project investment.
2/ Loan 682-CO (US$18.5 million) approved May 26, 1970; see Project
Performance Audit Report No. See.N79-632 of August 22, 1979.

Preappraisal and Appraisal
2.01       The project works were part of Call's water and sewerage master
plan, prepared in 1969 and financed under Loan 682-CO. EMCALI and its con-
sultants completed feasibility studies of the planned works in October
1975.   There were two major issues during preparation and appraisal:
whether two components could be included in the project; and EMCALI's poor
financial performance.
2.02        Construction of the Aguablanca sewerage interceptor and the
Napoles stormwater drainage canal had been dropped from Loan 682-CO because
of overall project cost overruns, and because changes in urban development
patterns and unexpectedly heavy flooding during project execution made it
necessary to redesign both components.   ENCALI was to have financed the
works, but lacked the funds to do so. It was decided that the components
were so different from the original concept that they could be included in
the second project.
2.03      The Bank informed EMCALI in July 1976 that the new project would
not be appraised until substantial tariff increases had been implemented.
ENCALI's Board of Directors opposed the tariff increase and proposed a
property reassessment scheme that was to increase revenues by moving con-
sumers Into higher rate categories. The reassessment scheme, combined with
a one-year extension of the investment period and public sector loans of
Col$600 million, was to provide the necessary improvement in ENCALI'a
finances.   The Bank agreed to this proposal, and the tariff increase
requirement was dropped.
Negotiations
2.05      Negotiations with representatives of the Ninistry of Finance, the
City of Cali and ENCALI were held in Washington In mid-December 1977.
Major topics of discussion included the type of assurances that would be
given to ensure the provision of the public sector loans; establishment of
a system to ensure that interdivisional transfers of funds would be handled
on commercial terms; agreement on the annual amount to be collected through
valorization and the mechanisms for collecting it; and arrangements for
EKCALI to take over Yumbo's water supply system.   The Loan covenants
related to these and other key issues are summarized In Annex 2.
Principal Objectives
2.06      The project was aimed at improving sanitary conditions, Increas-
ing utilization of installed water production capacity, Improving living
standards in low-income areas (Barrios Populares), increasing the area



-A-
available for urban growth and strengthening EMCALI's management and finan-
cial position.  The project components designed to meet these goals are
presented in Annex 3. The sewerage and drainage component-s were to benefit
250,000 people directly, of whom 155,000 were urban poor. Another 160,000
inhabitants, 70,000 of whom were uzban poor, were to benefit from house
water connections.
III.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.01      The Board approved the project on February 21, 1978. Because of
delays in Government approval, the Loan was not signed until June 20, 1978.
The original effectiveness date was set for September 20, 1978, and comple-
tion was expected in December 1981.
Effectiveness and Start Up
3.02      There were two special conditions of effectiveness.  The condi-
tion requiring that Telephone Department tariffs be increased was met in
January 1978.  The condition requiring that satisfactory arrangements be
made for the Government and BCH loans to ElCALI was fulfilled in late
1978. In the meanwhile, it had become evident that WSD would not meet the
covenanted 3% rate of return in 1979 unless tariffs were substantially
increased.  In November 1978, the Bank informed EMCALI that the Loan would
not be declared effective until EMCALI's Board approved a tariff increase
sufficient to increase revenues by 39%. The increase was to become effec-
tive January 1, 1979.  On January 5, 1979, EKCALI's Board approved a 25%
increase which the Bank believed would allow the Borrower to comply with
the rate of return covenant, even though WSD was still expected to incur a
net loss in 1979. The Loan was declared effective on January 31, 1979.
Project Execution
3.03      The contracting schedule prepared at appraisal was overly opti-
mistic.   In addition, EMCALI's managerial/staffing problems and lack of
funds caused delays during the early stages of execution.  EICALI did not
put into effect the organizational structure adopted in March 1977 until
one year later, and was slow to reassign personnel thereafter. This prob-
lem was compounded by a change in management in 1978 and a labor problem
that resulted in the resignation of more than half WSD's engineers in
January 1979. These positions were not filled until mid-1980.
3.04       Because of the shortage of funds, ENCALI was unable to pay its
consultants.   EMCALI's Board delayed some project components in 1979 while
financial problems were being reassessed.  Another major source of delay
was the lengthy process of arranging for the collection of betterment



-5 -
leVIes (valorization) for the sewerage and drainage works and for the Ymubo
component, a condition of disbursement. The agreements with the valoriza-
tion off-ces of the Cauca Valley Department (for Yumbo) and the Municipal-
ity of Cali (for the sewerage and dralnage works) were signed In March 1980
and collection began in March 1981.
3.05      Because of these delays, continuing shortages of funds and tech-
nical difficulties discussed In Annex 4, the project was slightly less than
50% complete by the time of cancellation.  Completion of two subprojects,
representing 6% of the appraisal cost estimate, has been postponed indefi-
nitely. Most components are scheduled for completion by the end of 1984,
while completion of network rehabilitation In Yumbo's residential area is
projected for mid-1986. These goals are attainable, if timely financing is
obtained.
Suspension of Disbursements and Cancellation
3.06      After effectiveness, ERCALI's financial situation remained poor.
The property reassessment program was implemented but did not generate the
hoped-for revenue increase.   Tne tariff increase approved in January 1979
as a condition of effectiveness was not implemented until June 1, 1979.
Payments on EKCALI's short-term debt, incurred to finance overruns under
Loan 682-CO and to cover uncollected valorization, were overdue and subject
to penalty Interest of up to 36% per annum. The Bank suggested that EKCALI
refinance the debt, but attempts to do so had been unsuccessful. EWCALI
was financing its deficits by deferring its accounts payable.
3.07      By early June 1979, EKCALI had arranged to borrow USS21.8 million
from the Euro-Latin American Bank (EULABAKK) to refinance its short-term
debt.   As the Government was not willing to guarantee the loan, EKCALI
obtained the guarantee of a consortium of local banks, on the - condition
that EKCALI pledge a portion of Its revenues as collateral.    ENCALI
reqti. sted that the Bank waive its negative pledge rights.  The Bank decided
to use granting the waiver as leverage to ensure that ENCALI would take
measures to improve its financial position.
3.08      EMCALI was officially informed of the Bank's conditions for waiv-
ing Its negative pledge rights in July 1979. Tne major conditions required
that EXCALI: increase water and telephone tariffs to ensure compliance with
the rate of return covenants; start collecting valorization charges;
present a financial plan to cover the projected deficits; and ensure that
funds would be provided from the public sector loans. These conditions
were not met, -out as ENCALI had made some efforts to improve its position,
the Bank extended deadline for compliance until tne end of February 1980.
EICALI was warned that non-compliance could result in suspension of dis-
bursements.



- 6 -
3.09       In mid-February, URCALI dropped its request for waiver of the
negative pledge rights and arranged to grant the Bank an informal revenue
pledge similar, but not equivalent, to the one granted to EULABANK. ERCALI
and the Bank began negotiating a formal agreement. A request for water and
telephone tariff increases was presented to the Wational Tariff Board (UTB)
at the end of January, and valorization agreements with the Departmental
and Municipal offices were signed in March. The Bank decided to extend the
deadline for compliance until May 31, 1980.
3.10      A water tariff restructuring and Increase, below the amount the
Benk had recommended, were implemented In Jume 1980. The Bank Informed
ENCALI that it would have to begin collecting valorization by the end of
October, increase phone tariffs by the end of September and request another
water tariff Increase In September, or the Bank would suspend disburse-
ments. The telephone Increase was Implemented In November 1980, but col-
lection of valorization was postponed, and EXCALI's Board was not willng
to take any action to increase water tariffs until mid-1981. Disbursements
were suspended In January 1981.
3.11      ENCALI was informed that before disbursements would be resumed,
it would have to: (a) implement tariff increases that would allow RSD to
meet its rate of retu-rn covenant In 1981 and thereafter; (b) collect the
first valorization payments; (c) furnish adequate financing plans for all
three Departments; and (d) complete arrangements to provide the Bank with a
revenue pledge equivalent to the one given to EULABANK.
3.12        In August 1981, ERCALI and the Bank agreed that ENCALI would
i^plement one-time water and sewerage tariff Increases of 21% In September
1981 and 10% in July 1982.   Automatic monthly Increments were to be
increased and continued Indefinitely.  ENCALI was to take any other mea-
sures necessary to permit WSD to earn a 5% rate of return in 1982. ERCAL
had begun to bill for valorization charges in March 1981, but collections
had reached only 47% of billings.  ENCALTI agreed to ensure  that at least
50% would be collected in 1981 and thereafter, and to prepare a plan to
improve the collection rate. As part of this plan, EKCALI was to provide
evidence that the Cauca Valley Department had provided ENCALI with two pay-
ments of ColS50 million each In December 1981 and June 1982.  EMCALI also
agreed to revise WSD's Investment program to keep it consistent with avail-
able Internal resources. Interdepartmental transfers were to be treated as
commercial loans, in accordance with the Loan Agreement.   Because of
Government objections to ENCALI's plans to enter Into an agreemen.: with the
Bank on the negative pledge rights, the Bank decided to resolve the issue
with the Government, rather than ENCALI.  Disbursements were resumed on
September 4, 1981.



- 7 -
3.13      In mid-June 1982, EMCALI requested that the closing date be post-
poned from June 30, 1982 to June 30, 1984. Byr the time of the request, It
had become evident that ENCALI's compliance with the August 1981 conditions
was mixed. Tariffs were Increased by about 25% in September 1981, but no
farther tariff action was planned until October 1982, and the agreed rate
of return would not be met. Valorization collections had Increased to 53%,
but the plan to further Increase the percentage had not been prepared. The
Department had made its December 1981 payment, but the June 1982 payment
was delayed.   Tnterdepartmental transfers were not yet accruing interest.
There had been no progress on resolving the negative pledge rights issue.
In early August 1982, the Bank Informed ENCALI that St could not then
extend the closing date, but that It would not make a formal decision until
after the newly elected municipal government had been able to review the
situation. After a thorough review of aUl the issues In September-October
1982, the Bank decided not to extend the closing date and to cancel the
remaining funds (US$5.76 million).
Procurement
3.14       All contracts were awarded In accordance with Bank guidelines.
Civil works and consulting contracts were awarded to local fims.  Con-
tracts for supply of equipment and materials were awarded to local and
foreign firms.
3.15       A procurement problem arose over a disagreement on how to dis-
burse for EXCALI's expenditures for the supply of pipe fabricated locally
from Imported steel plate.  ENCALI's contract with the pipe fabricators
caUled for ENCALI to pay the suppliers of the materlals directly, in dol-
lars.   ENCALI wanted the procurement of materials to be treated as a
foreign cost (and thus reimbursable at 100%) and the cost of fabrication, a
local cost.  The Bank considered the entire cost local.  The Bane  allowed
the purchase of the materials to be treated as a foreign cost on an excep-
tional basis because obtaining foreign currency would have caused delays
and increased costs.
Performance of Consultants and Contractors
3.16         The consultants retained to prepare feasibility studies and
final designs and to supervise construction performed well, with one excep-
tion. The designs for the Cauca interceptors were found to be based on In-
adequate soil studies. The consultants in charge of supervising construc-
tion completed the studies.  The designs for the pumping station caisson
and for some sectors of the interceptor then had to be revised.



-8-
3.17       Civil works contractors and suppliers generaUly performed satis-
factori}y. One prime contractor, however, had little experience with the
unstable solls along the Cauca river.  The contractor and ENCALI are set-
tling the resulting claims for pipe failure.  A contract with one local
pipe supplier who failed to supply pipe of the specified quality was can-
celled.
Project Cost
3.18       Project cost estimates are summarized on the following page, and
presented in detail in Annex 5. ENCALI's cost estimates are acceptable, if
there are no  furtner delays in  execution.   Overruns in project cost,
excluding interest and other charges during construction, are estimated at
68% in current prices and 13% in 1977 prices. Altnough the costs of all
components exceeded appraisal estimates, overruns in the Tumbo, Cauca
interceptor and sanitary sewerage components are responsible for the
greatest increases. The cost of the Yumbo component increased because the
condition of the network in the residential area was worse than expected.
The appraisal estimates for the Cauca interceptor and sanitary sewerage
components were not based on final designs, and thus were subject to varia-
tion. In addition, the scope of the sewerage component was expanded.
3.19       Interest and other charges during construction were 85% less than
estimated during appraisal in current prices, and 90% lower in 1977 pri-
ces. This was caused by the delays in drawing down the Loan, the Bak *s
not financing charges during the time disbursemeents were suspended and a
reallocation of funds to cover cost overruns in other categories.

Disbursements
3.20      A cumulative schedule of disbursements is presented in Annex 6.
Disbursements initially lagged behind the appraisal estimate because the
Loan did not become effective until almost one year after Board presenta-
tion. Slowness In arranging for ENCALI to take over the Yumbo system and
in signing the valorization agreements (conditions of disbursement for the
Yumbo, sewerage and drainage components) and the January-September 1981
suspension of disbursements were the causes of the remaining delay.  In
August 1982, the percentage of disbursement for local expenditures was
reduced from 25% to 11% and funds were reallocated because of the cost
overruns (Anmex 7).
IV. OPERATIgG PERFORNANCE
4.01      The volume of water sold was 6% less than expected at appraisal.
The shortfall was the result of the lower than expected number of new con-
nections In Cali, the delay in completing the Tumbo residential component
and high unaccounted-for water.
4.02      Unaccounted-for water, which was to have been reduced from about
30% in 1977 to 23%, reached 41% in 1979. It was reduced to about 38% in
1982 through a leak detection and repair program begun under the project.
Most of the remaining unaccounted-for water is due to Mllegal connections
in low-Income neighborhoods, particularly In the Aguablanca area.

Automatic monthly tariff increases during most of 1977-82 and the one-time
increases implemented in 1979-81 (paras. 3.09, 3.13 and 3.15) kept USD's
revenues above the appraisal estimates.   These revenues were not bigh
enough to offset increases in operating expenses, however. By far the
largest increase was in wages and salaries, which were more than twice the
amount estimated at appraisal in current prices.  This is partly the result
of higher than forecast pension expenses and partly because of a 40%
increase in staff between appraisal and the end of 1982. These two factors
were the main causes of EMCALI's shortage of usable funds from operations.
Funds from valorization were 60% less than estimated at appraisal (Annex
9).   EMCALI had little influence over this result, as the Departmental and
Municipal valorization offices were responsible for billing and collec-
tion. The deficit was covered by pension reserves, transfers from other
divisions and long-term debt.   Despite the chronic shortage of funds,
EMCALI's investments in water supply and sewerage works were much higher
than anticipated at appraisal.
5.02       EMCALI's record of compliance with financial covenants is poor.
WSD's debt service coverage ratio was below the covenanted level (1.3) in
all years except 1982.  Rates of return on WSD's revalued fixed assets in
operation are shown below:

Power Department, Telephone Department and Consolidated Results
5.03           During 1977-1982, despite lower than projected sales and a
progressively less satisfactory financial performance, the Power Division
complied with its rate of return covenant.  The Telephone Division fell
short of the covenanted rate of return during 1977-1982, mainly because of
its inability to extend networks and increase connections.  ENCALI's total
net operating revenues in current prices were 15% lower, and loans received
11OZ higher, than estimated at appraisal. EMCALI's overall debt service
coverage ratio was 0.89 against 1.97 at appraisal.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
6.01      WSD's staff grew from about 1,000 employees at appraisal to about
1,400 employees in 1982, despite the labor problems and hiring freeze in
1979-80.Z5/ The ratio of employees per 1,000 connections had increased to
eight by 1982, versus seven at appraisal. The General Manager was changed
frequently, but there has been relatively little turnover in the next level
of managers.  Staff are competent and qualified.  EMCALI's organizational
structure, which has changed little since 1977, remains satisfactory.
6.02       EMCALI did not contract the technical assistance called for by
the Loan Agreement.    ENCALI's staff modestly improved interdepartmental
coordination, accounting, internal controls, budgeting and management
information systems.  Physical plans, however, still do not adequately con-
sider operational capabilities and financial limitations. ENCALI now has
timely and satisfactory accounting and budget compliance information, but
the systems are not integrated and accounting and report processing costs
need to be reduced. EMCALI's ability to improve its financial performance
has been limited not by inadequate systems, but rather by political pres-
sures which resulted in overstaffing, inadequate tariffs and high unac-
counted-for water.
5/ Most of this growth occurred just before the 1982 elections.

VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
7.01        The social objectives of the project set at appraisal will be
substantially  met.    An  additional  population  of  about  160,000  (as
appraised), including 70,000 urban poor, is expected to benefit from water
connections in Cali. Water rationing for about 20,000 middle- and high-
income residents will be eliminated.   A population of 225,000 (against
250,000 at appraisal) will benefit from the sewerage and drainage subpro-
jects.   About  155,000 of these beneficiaries are urban poor  (180,000
estimated at appraisal). In addition, 85% of Cali's population will bene-
fit from reduced contamination of the Cauca River above the treatment plant
intakes.   Improved quantity and quality of water service will benefit a
population of 47,000 (about as appraised) in Yumbo.
7.02        At appraisal, an overall financial rate of return (IFRR) was
estimated based on five subprojects.6/ The IFRR on the Cali water supply
subproject (8% of project cost) was estimated using tariff revenues as a
proxy for benefits. The IFRR on the Yumbo subproject (22% of project cost)
was based on a combination of tariff revenues and an estimated increase in
land values. A combined IFRR was estimated for the sewerage subprojects
(57Z of project cost) using an estimated increase in land values as a bene-
fit.
7.03      Completion rates of return have been estimated for the Cali water
supply and Yumbo subprojects based on actual tariff revenues for the for-
mer, and actual tariff revenues and valorization collections for the lat-
ter. Since valorization collections were expected at appraisal and actual
records show that investment costs of the Yumbo subproject will be sub-
stantially recovered, valorization better reflects project benefits now
than unreliable estimates of the increased value of land. -
7.04         EMNCALI did not keep detailed records to monitor the actual
increases in land values attributable to the Yumbo and sewerage subpro-
jects.   In the absence of these records, reliable and detailed data on
actual increases could not be developed. Based on rough estimates of the
possible increase in land values, and compared to the value of land in
areas with similar characteristics, some data has been developed to permit
the calculation of at least an indicative rate of return for the sewerage
subprojects.   Substantial valorization collection were not expected at
appraisal.
7.05       The estimated IFFR for the Cali water supply subproject is 38%
compared to 36% at appraisal. The estimated IFFR for the Yumbo subproject
is 2%, compared to 13% at a,praisal.  Yumbo water sales are expected to be
about 10% lower than estimated at appraisal, because many industries have
built their own facilities to obtain water for industrial use.  In addi-
tion, tariffs, which were expected to be the same as for Cali, are now
expected to be lower.

Yumbo subprojects.

7.06      Using the rough estimates for land value increases based on the
methodoloy and assumptions at appraisal and discussions with the Borrower
(para. 7.03), the indicative IFRR for the sewerage subprojects is estimated
at 20% (21% at appraisal).   A weighted average IFFR for the project is
estimated at 21% (22Z at appraisal).  This estimate should be considered
indicative, because the sewerage subprojects account for 57Z of project
cost.
VIII.   BANK PERFORMANCE
8.01      The combination of an overly optimistic execution schedule and of
EMCALI's less than satisfactory performance led to an expected four-year
delay in project completion.  It would have been difficult for the Bank to
foresee all the problems that arose during execution, but experience under
Loan 682-CO and EMCALI's plans to revise its organizational structure
should have persuaded the Bank to adopt a more realistic schedule.  A later
start and a longer execution period should have been estimated.
8.02       Despite intense and well-directed supervision, the Bank was of
Limited help in improving EMCALI's operating and financial performance.
The supervision missions were comprehensive and Bank staff worked closely
with the Borrower to identify technical and financial problems and agree on
so_utions.  It is doubtful the Bank could have better assisted EMCALI in
reducing unaccounted-for water (para. 4.02) in view of the increase in
illegal connections. Measures the Bank proposed to improve EMCALI's finan-
cial position were watered down or offset by other policies (such as staff
increases).
8.03       The main question to be asked now is whether the Bank was too
patient with EHCALI's failure to improve its financial performance.  The
Bank consistently required ENCALI to take specific measures. Just as con-
sistently, the Bank accepted the less stringent measures EMCALI was pre-
pared to take.  Since EMCALI's difficult situation allowed little margin
for financial measures to be softened, the Bank should have been more firm,
particularly during loan processing and the early stage of project execu-
tion.   The Bank rightly decided not to extend the Loan closing date; by
that time, it was quite clear that local authorities were not committed to
strengthening EMCALI's finances.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01      The project will be successful in improving water supply services
and sanitary conditions in Cali, using better the water produced and
increasing land for urban use, but these objectives will be met four years
past the appraisal estimate. The present schedule to complete the project



- 14 -
is technically realistic.   Because the investment needed to complete the
project is a relatively small part of EMCALI's total investment program and
because EMCALI has assigned priority to project completion, this schedule
is also financially feasible.
9.02        Because revenues were insufficient to adequately finance high
expenses and debt service, EMCALI's financial performance was poor. EMCALI
could improve its performance by better controlling expenses and invest-
ments. Since it would take some time for such measures to yield important
results, and because of its large debt service, EMCALI will have to in-
crease tariffs soon to be able to carry out its entire investment program.
9.03      Although ENCALI has competent staff and has improved its informa-
tion systems, it has been unable to set realistic goals, carry out the mea-
sures to reach these goals and improve its operational efficiency. Politi-
cal pressures to carry out more investments, employ more people and provide
even greater subsidies to poor customers and inability to increase tariffs
have prevented EMCALI's management from performing better.
9.04      With the benefit of hindsight, it is easy to question the wisdom
of proceeding with the project in 1977. EMCALI's financial performance had
been poor under Loan 682-CO.  The prospects for substantially increasing
revenues through the property reassessment scheme were uncertain.  It is
doubtful that valorization should have made up such a large part of the
financing plan because the effectiveness of recovering costs through such
charges in Cali was unproven, and because billing and collection were not
under EMCALI's direct control.   In the face of such uncertainty, the Bank
should have delayed Board Presentation until a more certain plan to improve
ENCALI's finances could be defined.

(EKCALI)
Cali, Colombia
2-GG-870              Cali, September 21, 1983
Mr. Guillermo Yepes
Deputy Chief, Water Supply
and Sewerage Division
Latin America and Caribbean
Regional Office
WorLd Bank, Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Yepes:
During the week of July 4-8 of this year, we had the pleasure of
a vislt from a Bank mission consisting of Messrs. Julio Linares and Adman
Cajina and Miss Madeline DeVan, which came to prepare the Completion Report
on the water supply and sewerage project financed by loan 1523-CO in an
initial total amount of US$13.8 million.
ECALLI has considered the Bank missions to be of special import-
ance because they contribute by their knowledge and experience to the
strengthening of financial and technical management in the areas where the
loans are applied.
During the life of the loan agreement in question EHCALI carried
out the following:
1.        Actuarial study to determine pension liabilities;
2.        Contracting of the collection of bettermeat levies for facilities
instalnled under the project through the municipal and departmen-
tal Valorization Offices;
3.        Establishment of  internal  procedures  to  recover investments
directly.
4.        Reclassification  of  certain  nonoperating  costs  as  operating
costs.
5.        Implementation of control and rationalization policies for expen-
ditures in general, and regular payroll, overtime, fuel consump-
tion and vehicle use in particular;
6.        Billing illegal connections at -minimum coasumption  rates in
areas with illegal connections, until legal water, sewerage and/
or power connections are installed;

7.        Reduction of unaccounted-for water from 41% in 1981 to 37Z in
1983;
8.        Tariff increases of 30.72 in 1979, 25.5Z in 1980, 44.2Z In 1981
and 44.5Z in 1982; and
9.        Establishment of mechanisms to collect official accounts receiv-
able. By its Resolutiou No. 029 of April 25, 1983, the Board
approved treating official entities as private consumers, i.e. by
cutting off service.    At the same time, 24-month refinancing
overdue amounts was autborized.
The mission asked ENCALT's opinion on the administrative, techni-
cal. and financial aspects of the project.
To meet this request, three topics wiU be analyzed:
(1) project execution period;
(2)  cost;
(3) achievement and/or postponement of proposed targets.
1= Execution Period
The project was originally scheduled for execution between June
1978 and December 1981. Bowever, the Loan was not declared effective by
the Bank until 1979, which led to delays in the design and contract award.
The problems that arose in the execution of the project, aggra-
vated by the cancellation of the Loan balance of US$5 million, have caused
further delays, and it is now estimated that the project works wiU not be
completed until November 1984, three years behind schedule, except for the
Yumbo residential systems, which will be completed in 1986.
The main problems with contracting, administrative and financial
in nature, were the following:
- Failure on the part of the Coltubos company to supply sewer
pipes, when the installation contracts were under wy.
- The initial schedule for calling for bids and awarding con-
tracts for the works was too tight and failed to take into
account the time required for administrative and other official
procedures.

ANRE I}I
Page 3 of 4
- The delay in declaring the loan effective resulted in resched-
ulings and delays in preparing the designs and therefore held
up execution of the works, especially as regards the designs
for the Cauca subproject and the execution of the Tumbo subpro-
ject works.
- The squatter settlements which grew in the areas earmarked for
execution of the drainage subproject impeded progress.
2. Cost
As a result of the delay in execution, the total cost of the pro-
ject has risen from CoL$1,777 million to Col$3,680 million.
The basic cost of the Cauca subproject is higher than estimated
as the initic_ estimates were made before the plans were ready and the
information was incomplete.
The quality of the soil was subsequently found to be poor and
this considerably increased construction costs and helped to delay the
works even further.
3. Achievement and/or Pbstponement of Proposed Targets
The cancellation by the Bank of the balance of the loan has had a
major impact on achievement of project targets, so that the estimated com-
pletion date of end-1983 will have to be put back to end-1984 and, for the
Yumbo subproject, to 1986. As a result, project goals will not be achieved
until later than scheduled,  or will only be partially achieved and this
will be an additional factor in increasing the cost of the project.
The degree of achievement of the project goals is analyzed below
by subproject:
1. CaJli Water Supply Sub-roject
The Ciudad Jardin tank and the distribution systems have been
installed.   The La NormaL pumping station has been deferred
indefinitely as there is a better alternative, so the aim of
eliminating rationing in the higher areas during summer has still
not been achieved.
2. Yumbo Subproject
Service has been installed in the industrial zone. Yumbo' s resi-
dential area depends on the pumping station in Puerto Isaacs,
which will be completed in mid-1984, and on rehabilitation of the
systems, which will be carried out gradually between now and
1986. The aim of supplying Yumbo with drinking water has accord-
ingly been partially achieved.

3. Stormvater Drainage Subproject
System construction in the low-income districts bas been par-
tially completed.
4. Cauca Subproject
This subproject win be finisbed at the end of 1984.
ENCALI considers the World Bankk's assistance in financing pro-
jects with a social impact to be of vital importance and has made it a pri-
ority to lay the administrative and financial bases that will make it pos-
sible to obtain further loans from the Bank.
