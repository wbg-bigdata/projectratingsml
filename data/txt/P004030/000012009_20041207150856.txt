                                  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

    Background
In relation to the Kompong Kdei (or Praptos) ancient bridge, the initial scheme as contained in the
construction documents was that it remain a part of the newly rehabilitated National Road number
6. It was intended to strengthen the bridge by casting a continuous reinforced concrete slab beneath
the roadway over the whole width and length of the bridge in order to distribute the loading more
evenly over the arches. However, due to the ever increasing traffic and more particularly, the
heavy nature of this traffic, it was decided to re-examine the viability of continuing to keep the
bridge an essential part of this national road. Subsequent studies of other options resulted in a
decision to construct a bypass around the bridge. This meant that villages currently off the road
would be affected, hence the need to undertake further investigation into the environmental and
social impacts of this new design as well as to develop a comprehensive resettlement action plan to
take into consideration the necessary compensation means to be adopted in relation to these
affected people.

    Scope and methodology
The environmental impact assessment (EIA) was conducted afresh in relation to the
selected bypass route but the social impact assessment (SIA) was conducted to update the
information collected by Oriental Consultants Co. in 1999, due to the length of time
elapsed since this information was collected. The methodology adopted for these two
studies included individual household interviews with both affected and non-affected
families, focus group discussions using PRA related tools with groups of villagers both
along the bypass route and off the route, interviews with village leader and elders. The
field work was completed over a one month period in March 2004, with the results being
analysed and the report completed in April 2004.

    Key findings
The main issues raised by the people in relation to environmental concerns centered more
strongly on the immediate impacts during construction work rather on the longer term
issues. They are most concerned about disturbances due noise and dust factors arising
from the operation of construction equipment. However, longer term issues were raised
and also observed by the assessment team and these issues included the need to be
conscious of protecting where possible existing valuable trees, avoiding erosion and
sedimentation of the Chikreng stream, and ensuring there is no deterioration in the water
quality of this stream. Measures proposed to address these issues are discussed in Part II of
this report under the environment management plan (EMP)
Regarding the social issues, the information collected largely confirms the results of the
OCC study conducted in 1999 in that there has been little change in the quality of life of
the people in the meantime. Many problems remain regarding rural infrastructure, water
supply, health, education and social problems that need to be addressed urgently to
complement what the people see as a major contribution to their communities, namely the
rehabilitation of the National Road # 6. These issues are discussed in more detail in Part
III of this report.

    Conclusion
The conclusion of the studies is that the bypass is generally viewed as a positive
contribution to the communities. There is no opposition to it, only some concerns related
to environmental and social issues that can readily be addressed through adherence to the
agreed environment management plan (EMP) as well as additional projects by either

1   Policy, legal and administrative framework

The Royal Government of Cambodia had received technical assistance by the
ADB (TA 2078 CAM) to strengthen the capacity building of the relevant authorities
in incorporating environmental considerations into project design where
appropriate.

The training course on the fundamentals of environmental impact assessment
(EIA) was given to thirty-eight governmental officials between October 1995 and
June 1996 (EIA, 1997).

During that time, the Ministry of Environment developed the policy on
environmental assessment according to requirement by donor, especially ADB
foundation. This policy development was supported by ADB, both technical and
financial, in collaboration with Ministry of Environment to ensure any development
interventions do not give rise to negative impact on the environment.

Declaration No 49 of Ministry of Environment, mentioned that any private
individuals, private companies, joint-venture companies, public companies,
ministries, government agencies must prepare a report of environmental impact
assessments for the proposed projects, activities and existing activities.

Adapted by JOC (1998), the law on Environmental Protection and Natural
Resources Management is general but nevertheless identifies the Ministry of
Environment as the lead agency with regard to Environmental Assessment.
Decrees (policies) and sub-decrees (regulations) in Appendix A1 dealing with
Environmental Assessment, pollution and other related matters must now be
developed to fully empower the Ministry of Environment to do its job.

In the Article 3 of Cambodian Sub-Decree, the Ministry of Environment has the
duties to:
    -  Examine and evaluate the report on EIA in collaborating with other lined
       Ministry-Institutions.
    -  Monitor and have the measure on project's owner to comply with the
       Environmental Management Plan during construction, operation, and
       closure, the project as it is mentioning in the approved EIA report.

The 5 agencies joint in collaboration in Environmental Assessment with Ministry of
Environment, those are Ministry of Public Work and Transportation, Ministry of
Rural Development, Ministry of Industry, Mine and Energy, and Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery. The MoE established a branch for responsibility
at the provincial level namely Provincial Department of Environment.

Recorded of Sub-Decree No 72 ANRK.BK, the MoE shall cooperate with relevant
agencies to stop the activity of those projects, which fall to implement the
Environmental Management Plan contained in the approved EIA report.




                                                                                 7

2   Project description

2.1 Type of Project

The project under consideration is part of an overall project of rehabilitation and
upgrading of the main national roads. It traverses predominantly rural areas with
small urban areas and small villages perched along the road. The rehabilitation
stretch of circa 80 km covers four districts including Siem Reap, 17 communes and
52 villages comprising about 370,500 people (Vijghen, J.L., 2001).

This project concentrates on the proposal to construct a new bypass in Chikreng
District to protect the ancient bridge at Kompong Kdei. This bridge is considered to
be one of the most important Angkor period bridge structures within Cambodia and
is the gateway from the south into the Angkor region.

The rehabilitation proposals for this structure, as contained in the contract,
requires that the bridge, after the provision of a reinforced concrete deck slab,
laterite block footpaths and certain minor repairs to one abutment, continues to
serve as an integral part of National Road No 6. However, further examination of
the current condition of the fabric of this laterite block structure has indicated that it
would be most unwise to continue to subject the bridge to the loadings and
vibrations from present day heavy goods vehicle traffic. The contract rehabilitation
proposals are, therefore, no longer deemed to be appropriate and a bypass of the
bridge has been determined as necessary to safeguard the long-term integrity of
the structure and to maximize its potential as a significant heritage attraction. (PCI,
2003).

The new bypass was initially proposed by the Apsara Authority to the Ministry of
Public Work and Transportation with agreement of all relevant agencies. In
December 3rd 2002, Prime Minister Hun Sen declared his support for this idea to
construct the bypass. Before coming up with the bypass option B, studies were
conducted on three possible options, however, option A and C are expensive and
high negative impact (PCI, 2001) rather than option B so that this option B was
selected for implementation. The main purpose is to protect the Kompong Kdei
Ancient Bridge.

2.2 Location

The Ancient Bridge is located between the two villages of Thmey in Kok Tlok Krom
commune to the west of the bridge, and Kampong Kdei I village to the east of the
bridge. It was constructed during the Cheya Varamogn VII period of the Angkor
regime in the 12nd century and is 85 metres long and 15 metres in width.

The new proposed bypass stretch 1300 metres long across Thmey, Anlong Vile
and Kampong Kdei II villages (map in Figure 3.1).




                                                                                        8

2.3 Objective of the study

    a. To conduct a preliminary environmental assessment screening of the
       alternative alignments identified,
    b. To conduct environmental assessment of the environmental issues and
       impacts along the recommended alignment of the proposed Kampong Kdei
       Bridge Bypass due to construction work and future traffic,
    c. To determine the environmental issues and impacts on the Kampong Kdei
       community due to the change in the flow of traffic caused by the bypass,


2.4 Scope and Methodology

2.4.1 Scope of works

The study focused only on the chosen bypass option B and included interviewing 7
villages through group discussions with selected villagers in each of the
communities. The villages interviewed were Thmey, Anlong Vile, Korkos, Krabei
Real, Kompong Kdei I, Kompong Kdei II and Prasat (Map in Figure 3.2).

It should be noted that the timeframe was limited with the whole study being
completed a 1 month period.

2.4.2 Methodology of the study

Three main steps were carried out as part of this study: firstly, review of all
secondary information from World Band Guideline regarding the World Bank
Operational Directives and review of information from Governmental Guidelines,
as per the terms of reference. Secondly, the collection of data from the villages.
This comprised three components such as field visit, formal interview through
group discussion (or PRA), reconnaissance survey along the route and informal
meeting with local residents. The information was systematically collected for
analysis by using the agreed questionnaires and checklist (See Appendix B). The
group discussion generally consisted of 10 to 15 people per group with separation
of affected and non-affected families. Thirdly, the data collected was analyzed
through qualitative analysis.

3    Baseline data

3.1 Physical Environment

3.1.1 Geology, Soils and Topography

Adapted from SMEC (1997), the project on National Road No 6 lies wholly within
the Great Lake Basin (Tonle Sap Lake) where is divided into two units:
    · the areas that are inundated each year from the annual flood, and
    · areas of older deposition to the north, south and west of the lake, including
       those streams that drain the southern uplands and the south and south east
       of the Korat plateau.



                                                                                  9

Within the Cambodia, two difficult soil have been noted, those are Acid sulphate
soils and Dispersive soils (SMEC, 1997).

The acid sulphate soils are generally poorly drained, heavy textured, very acidic
alluvial clay soils occur in some area of Prey Veng and Svay Rieng. These soils
only cause a problem when they are disturbed, such as during the construction of
a road or bypass. Adapted from SMEC (1997), fortunately none of these occurs in
the project area on National Road No 6.

Adapted from SMEC (1997), dispersive soils are recorded in the project area. It is
the property of certain clay soils to readily move into suspension in still water.
Such soils are highly erodible, and embankments constructed from them are liable
to failure from piping and surface erosion unless suitable provisions are taken.
Quoted from Abrams (1994), dispersive soils are related to the chemistry of water
adsorbed onto the surfaces of the clay particles, specifically high levels of sodium.

The majority soils of the National Road No 6 have low or moderately dispersive
clays (SMEC, 1997).

According to the PRA's conducted during this assessment, most of the community
land of the bypass area are wetlands which flood almost every year at the low
topography level.

3.1.2 Climate and Wind Flow

Within Cambodia, the climate is tropical monsoon that two main seasons within the
country are, wet season from May until early October results from the south-west
monsoon origin over the Indian Ocean, and dry season from November to April
results from the northeast.

Adapted from SMEC (1997), 85 % of precipitation occurs during the monsoon.
Average annual rainfall in the project area should ranges between 1360 mm at
Kampong Thom to over 1430 mm at Siem Reap. Evaporation of the project area
should vary around 1020 mm as recorded at Siem Reap annual evaporation
records. The rainfall generally has started within the wet season from May to
October; however it occurs also un-normally in dry season.

At the end of the year around October-November the wind is cooler than the other
months and its direction flows from north of the project area while multiple direction
flows at the early year between February until April with warm temperature almost
over 30 oC.

3.1.3 Hydrology

Hydrology in Cambodia results from the flooding of the Mekong and Great Lake
basins that flows approximately 70% from Tibet, (northeast Thailand, and Laos),
as a source of mother water of the Mekong, while the remainder comes from
natural rainfall. Very large areas of the country are flooded each year due to the



                                                                                    10

fluctuation in Mekong water levels. Within the country, floods occur from August to
October every year with the highest peak during the Phchum Ben festival
(September/October).

Water flows across the national road 6 from either north or south of the road,
depending on time of the year, where source of water comes from high land and
Great Lake.

As noted by residents in the community, water flows and levels have fluctuated
over the past decade. The fluctuations largely depend on the precipitation during
the raining season. In 2000, there were heavy rains such that it flooded certain
parts of the affected villages, particularly village areas near by the Chikreng stream
such as Kampong Kdei I, Kampong Kdei II, Anlong Vile, Thmey, Krabei Real,
Prasat and Korkos villages.

The water levels reported in the community varied between 0.5 m to 1 m high
depending on the land level, with the exception of Thmey village which resulted
from improper culvert system. Mostly, flooding resulted from rainfall rather than
excess water from the Great Lake. This is an important consideration for the
bypass construction as it could affect the bypass during and after construction.
However, the level of rainfall that could adversely affect construction is rare.

An unusual occurrence in 2003 and 2004, was that rainfall was less than usual
such that it resulted in drought in the community which had an adverse affect on
agriculture production.

According to residents, the Kampong Kdei Bridge has never suffered serious
impact from any seasonal flooding even during the year 2000 when many villages
were inundated.     The residents report that the Chikreng water level peak is
normally between 7 m to 10 m depending on the water sources from Great Lake
and rainfall. The people strongly suggest that any construction undertaken
regarding this bypass takes all measures to ensure that this situation is retained
and that the construction does not result in floods or droughts in the future.

Generally there is lack of clean drinking water sources in the community and some
families go to collect water many kilometers from their houses. The water of the
Chikreng stream is utilized by residents for drinking, agricultural irrigation, animal
watering and for washing purposes.

3.2 Ecological Resources

3.2.1 Vegetation

Cambodia contains a lot of tropical rainforest with rich bio-diversity; however it has
been gradually deforested by humans for various purposes. 73 % of the forest
covered in the country during the last 3 or 4 decade have almost been depleted.

Along the embankment of National Road No 6, many fruit trees can be seen such
as mango, coconut, guava, milk tree, thagan, areca, palm tree, bamboo, banana



                                                                                    11

trees etc. On the north and south of the road, the rice field landscape is marked by
numerous palm trees, tamarind, sour apple and kawit trees around the various
small wetlands.

Large tracts of land to the South, near to the Great Lake side, are swamp, shrub
swamp and herbaceous swamp, mostly along the Great Lake bank. In the village
inhabited areas, there is little natural vegetation remaining as it was cleared over
the last few decades for housing and agriculture, except along the Chikreng
stream where there are many shrub trees (see picture in Appendix A3).

Similarly, the proposed bypass area is likely to affect around 20 trees, however,
only 5 or 6 trees can be classified as valuable trees. The trees mainly affected are
planted fruit trees rather than natural species, such as banana, mango, coconut,
bamboo and others ­ these are detailed in the RAP.

3.2.2 Wetlands and fisheries

The major wetland associated with the bypass project is the Great Lake (Tonle
Sap Lake). The Lake is created by a unique phenomenon not known in any other
part of the world, in which the flow reverses its direction twice a year. It is also one
of the most fertile plains and fresh water fishing areas in the world. It has been
designated an area for special protection for its rich natural resources.

The Tonle Sap Lake is currently the subject of a number of major studies, mainly
supported by the UN and UNESCO in particular. The Strategy and Action Plan for
the Protection of the Tonle Sap was officially released in December 1997. It
proposes inscription of selected parts of the Great Lake and its flooded plain onto
both the World Heritage; and as a Ramsar site, under the Convention on Wetlands
of International Importance, usually referred to as the Ramsar Convention. The
plan also proposes the establishment of a Biosphere Program. The proposed
boundaries for this reserve are RN 5 and RN 6 (SMEC, 1997).

The Lake receives about 62% of its water from the Mekong River, with the
remaining coming from rainwater in its catchment areas (Sethy, S, 2003). The lake
acts as a storage basin or outlet for Mekong River during the monsoon season. By
mid June, the Mekong water level rises faster than the Tonle Sap, the drainage
capacity of numerous outlets of the Mekong's delta system to the south China Sea
no longer keep up with the sheer volume of water flowing in the Mekong River, and
water is pushed westwards through the 120 km long Tonle Sap River into the
Tonle Sap Lake and its tributaries (including the Chikreng stream).

Due to the higher water levels in the Mekong during wet season flows through this
Tonle Sap River into the lake there by enlarging it 3 to 6 times from 2,700 km2 to
9,000-16,000 km2 (Juha, S., 2003).

Adapted from EIA volume III (1997) of Steung Chinit, the Lake ecosystem has
been fundamental to Cambodia's fisheries production from time immemorial. The
inundated forests of the floodplains serve as key spawning grounds and nursery
for most fresh-water fishes. The high organic content of the floodplain further



                                                                                      12

supports fish expansion and is a key factor in the inherent productivity of the inland
fisheries. Over 200 fish species have been recorded in the Tonle Sap area
including the giant Mekong Catfish.

The Lake is also effluence from the Mekong both water level and some species of
fish, however, regarding to Cambodia Daily dated March 26, 2004 in Volume 28
issue 76, the low Mekong water level is being blamed on a lack of rainfall during
last year's rainy season, but suspicion has also fallen on the massive dam projects
on the upper dream. The fish reduced quite a bit this year and fish larvae float
down the Mekong and grow in the flooded areas during the wet season.

Some fish species found at the project areas are changva, riel, kranh, chlang,
chpin,deap,ta'own, andaeng, kanchah, kreh, kantrab beng, chlonh, pdout,
kompleanh, kompel, kompoat, and bot; but, but some species were not currently
found in the stream (Chikreng stream) such as sanday, ros, kahay, ta'aon, kaek,
keh, damray, khla, chtoh, and trey bah. Loss of the fish resulted from over fishing
and illegal fishing such as use of bombs (over the last 10 years) and electrical
fishing. It could be additionally affected during bypass construction if provisions are
not taken to ensure uninterrupted flow of the downstream water.

3.2.3 Wildlife

During the field work for the EIA, very few birds were sighted in the proposed
project site while large wildlife (including tiger, lion, elephant, etc.) were non-
existant as they disappeared a number of decades ago due to civil war, forest fires
and deforestation for housing. Many of these animals were either killed or they
migrated to other parts of the country, generally more mountainous areas.

Water birds now occur only in the Tonle Sap Lake areas which is being preserved
by the Ministry of Environment. These water birds are likely to breed in the Lake
flood plain swamp. The swamps harbor a number of extremely rare water birds,
including a significant of Greater Adjutant (Leptoptilus dubius) comprising 10% of
world population (EIA volume III, 1997).

3.3 Socioeconomic conditions

3.3.1 Population and communities

The proposed bypass transects through 3 villages on the south of the RN 6 beside
the Ancient bridge-Kampong Kdei and 3 other villages are affected due to the
movement of the road from its existing course. The 6 villages are:

No     Village Names                         Family             Population
1      Kampong Kdei I                        97                 558
2      Kampong Kdei II                       148                770
3      Korkos                                176                927
4      Krabei Real                           115                656
5      Thmey                                 130                711
6      Anlong Vile                           181                1050



                                                                                     13

Examining the ethnic composition in the villages, we can see that the population is
mostly Khmer and Khmer-Chinese while only 2 families are Cham (Muslim). More
information of the socio-economic has discussed in Socio-Economic Assessment
Report.

3.3.2 Infrastructure

Improvement to RN 6 will greatly facilitate access to Siem Reap and the Angkor
Wat Temples. It connects the roads to Thailand through Banteay Meanchey
Province and to Viet Nam through either Phnom Penh capital city or Kampong
Cham Province. It is a major route used by tourists from Phnom Penh and
currently crosses the Kompong Kdei bridge over the Chikreng stream. Now in
order to preserve this ancient bridge as a national heritage and tourist attraction,
the proposed bypass will be constructed not over but very close by the bridge so
that it can be seen clearly from the road. Improvement of this road is also
benefiting not only travelers from other provinces but also the people living along
or near by the road.

3.3.3 Qualify of life values

It is important to note that RN 6 as elsewhere in the country is used for many other
purposes other than transport. Normally, the road is used as a service area, work
surface and selling of goods. At the edge of pavement and shoulders of the road at
proposed bypass community are used for retail activities, pedestrian movement
including schoolchildren, bicycle and motorcycle.

It is also expected by residents that similar activities will be done along the
proposed bypass after completion of the construction works.

3.3.4 Agriculture and Fishing

The main farming activities in the community areas of bypass are lowland rice
production, livestock rearing (including crocodiles), fruit tree production such as
mango, coconut, jack-fruit, banana, guava, soursop and areca palm trees, and
small scale vegetable growing.

It noted that there are only a few families engaged in the fishing business during
wet season at the Chikreng stream, and most of fishing activities take place to
supply food for the family.

Most agriculture and fish produce are sold within the community with the Kampong
Kdei market being the most popular selling place.

3.3.5 Education

In the villages interviewed, there are 2 primary schools, one in Kumro, and one in
Krabei Real, and 1 high school (including secondary school) namely the Kampong
Kdei High School.



                                                                                  14

During interviews with the village chiefs, they noted that all of children of school
going age have the chance to go to school but some children of poor families in
Korkos, Kampong Kdei II and Anlong Vile do not attend.

It is noted that 1476 students (including 1076 from secondary school) come from
12 communes in the Chikreng district but most of secondary students come from
the project's affected area.


4    Environmental impacts

Both positive and negative impacts resulting from implementation of the proposed
bypass near by the Kampong Kdei Bridge over the Chikreng stream are described
in this chapter.

4.1 Project Location

Positive Impacts:

Referring to the discussion paper on alternative alignments dated 21 July 2003, it
compared 3 options of bypass alignment referred to as Options A, B and C (see
Appendix A2).      The conclusion was that Option B would have less negative
impacts and was more economically sound than the other options studied and was
therefore proposed for implementation. This alternative satisfies the requirement of
the Government for the ancient structure to be clearly visible from the bypass, it
minimizes impacts on existing properties whilst preserving the integrity of the
existing town development and ensuring its continued viability and it will readily
allow existing businesses that will be bypassed to be relocated to positions along
the proposed alignment. It will also release the area surrounding the ancient bridge
for comprehensive redevelopment as a major tourist attraction of potentially
international significance and it will allow the bypass to be constructed under the
existing construction contract thus ensuring that the existing ancient bridge
structure is relieved of HGV loadings or vibrations at the earliest possible time. It is
also likely to be the cheapest overall solution, even when property appropriation
costs are taken into consideration as shown in the table below:

  Alternative      Description                                   Approximate cost
                                                                        (US $)
  A                Local bypass immediately adjacent to                 780,000
                   Ancient Bridge
  B                Local Bypass retaining view of Ancient               615,000
                   Bridge
  C                Bypass outside the limits of Kampong               1,200,000
                   Kdei town development

Construction of this bypass will increase the life expectancy of the Ancient Bridge,
as it will keep away heavy loads whose vibrations could easily cause destruction
and it will avoid the possibility of destruction during the reconstruction phase. This



                                                                                     15

bypass will also make travel to the Kompong Kdei market easier and shorter for
the villagers of Anlong Vile and retail activities can be resumed in close proximity
to the original locations.

Negative Impacts:

The property of 80 families, in three villages, will be impacted by the construction
of the bypass, including land, buildings, fruit trees and other crops.

There will also be a loss of business during the period of resettlement. Additionally,
Thmey village is in danger of suffering flooding after construction of the bypass if
the existing culvert system in the village will be blocked or not rehabilitated. It is
noted that the proposed bypass will be across this existing culvert.

4.2 Impacts due to Project Design

Positive Impacts:

Project design has been carried out in compliance with national development
policies which take into consideration the laws on Environmental Protection and
Natural Resource Management. It ensures optimal conditions for the protection of
the natural and physical resources.

Negative Impacts:

Without careful design, there is the danger of increased traffic accidents and loss
of valuable trees in the area.

4.3 Impacts during Project Construction

Positive Impacts:

Employment:

Over the planned one year implementation period, it is expected that there could
be significant benefit to the local people through employment on the project if the
contractor can be encouraged to use local labor where appropriate. This period
should also see additional income to the service providers in the area as there will
be increased demand for their services. The business community could benefit
also if the contractor is encouraged to buy local materials were appropriate. The
more the local people benefit from the project construction phase, the less likely
they are to cause friction with construction crews due to the expected disruption
that will naturally occur during any construction works.

Negative Impacts:

Health Impacts:
Impacts on public health, particularly local communities and workers during the
construction will happen. Most of direct impacts come from air pollution as dust



                                                                                   16

and gases will rise mainly from the movement of materials for the project
construction. There will be an increase in the volume of noise from the operation of
the construction equipment..

Erosion and sedimentation

Regarding to SMEC (1997) recorded that on RN 5 & 6 erosion and sedimentation
are not considered to be significant potential problems due to the flat terrain and a
landscape dominated by bunds (paddy fields). However, the proposed bypass
project will be across the Chikreng stream, the erosion from bypass and
sedimentation into the stream will rise, the extent of which depends on the
Engineer, how he/she pays attention to the environment and the disposal of
excessive waste.

Water quality

With clearing forest and plantation, more erosion and sedimentation will occur; this
issue will decrease water quality, reduce the depth of the stream which means that
water temperatures will rise. This could also affect the fish species in the stream.

Traffic:

During the construction period, it is not expected that there will be too much
disturbance to traffic as all traffic will continue to be routed along the existing
bridge until completion of construction. According to the traffic census conducted
during the field work which was taken at 15 minutes intervals, it shows a high
number of bicycle and motorcycle as opposed to other modes of transport.
Similarly private cars (small cars and trucks) are also higher than public transport
(vans and buss) that they operate from the morning until evening time or night
time.

4.4 Impacts during the bypass operation

Positive Impacts:

Social Infrastructure:

This project directly addresses the governmental policy of provision of social
infrastructure to rural areas. Many kinds of services will be accessed through the
provision of this bypass including retail activities, commercial, education, tourism
and health services.

Negative Impacts:

Traffic and accident:

Generally, with the improvement of the road condition, the number of travelers will
increase, and with this increased traffic flow, more accidents are likely to occur.
Those accidents are mostly due to increased speeds, with curved parts of the road
likely to be the highest danger points. It is strongly recommended that all potential
danger points are clearly marked with clear recommendations for speed level at
these points.    Implementation of these speed limits will need to be strongly
enforced to reduce the potential of accidents which impact not only on the vehicles
involved but also on other road users such as pedestrians and shop sellers along
the road.




                                                                                        18

Noise:

Noise will increase due to the increasing traffic, which will be nuisance not only
during the day time but also at night. Heavy goods trucks which are noisier than
normal traffic generally travel at night time and this can impact on the old and sick
people.

5   Analysis of alternatives

5.1 Alternative of proposed bypass

As mentioned in the project location of Bypass Alternative Alignments, the option B
is the best alternative accepted in the economically and environmentally sound
than other option A and C (Appendix A2). This option-B is also favored by
APSARA and MPWT in acceptation that tourists across this bypass have
opportunity seeing the ancient bridge. This has already been agreed following the
previous studied carried out and therefore no other alternatives need to be
considered at this stage.

5.2 Alternative Design

As the route has already been agreed on, the key issues that the MPWT need to
take into consideration in developing the contract agreement for construction are
the proper marking of curved areas along the route as well as the issues
mentioned above regarding disposal of waste to reduce sedimentation, building in
a provision to avoid blocking the existing drainage of Thmey village and the need
to preserve any valuable trees that can feasibly be retained along the bypass
route.

5.3 Alternative Technologies

As the contractor will likely have freedom to choose workers of his/her choice, it
should be an inherent part of the contract that preference be given to the use of
local labor. This will increase the local villagers perception of the project and their
acceptance of the necessary adjustments that it will bring to their lives. The same
consideration should be built in for the supply of materials.

Over the previous chapters, the anticipated impacts due to the project
implementation have already been discussed. This chapter sets out proposed
mitigation measures to reduce the envisaged negative impacts during and after
project implementation.

                                        ancient bridge until bypass completed.
Operation of the Traffic accident       Road signs installed in all places where
bypass                                  it is recommended to reduce speed (i.e.
                                        curved parts of the road). Road signs
                                        to    indicate  maximum     speed    limit
                                        allowed.    Local police empowered to
                                        efficiently enforce the speed limits.
                 Noise                  This can only be addressed by banning
                                        heavy goods traffic after certain hours
                                        of night time. If this can not legally be
                                        enforced, then reduced speed limits for
                                        heavy goods vehicles after 9.00 pm at
                                        night time should be introduced

6.2 Monitoring

6.2.1 Compliance Monitoring

The compliance monitoring program requires controlling all activities of the
contractors to ensure they adhere completely to the terms of the contract.
Activities of contractors during construction will be supervised by a senior engineer
acting on behalf of the Client or MPWT-WB. Regarding the environmental issues,
the engineer should have direct access to the project manager or has access for
decision making. The engineer needs to consider the environmental issues with as
much significance as the technical and economic aspects.


6.2.2 Monitoring Program

After the construction, the monitoring program should concentrate on the following
environmental indicators in the management plan including:

   · Provision of social infrastructure
   · Implementation of the forest program through the bypass shoulder sides
   · Avoidance of traffic Accident
   · Bypass user and people willingness survey
   · People displacement and resettlement survey


6.2.3 Institutional strengthening

Within the environmental assessment, an MPWT official has joined in the
environmental assessment training in terms of improving researching skills for
qualitative research.

During field work, our teams worked in collaboration with the MPWT and local
authorities which can yield more effective research results and ensuring the
sharing experiences of environmental knowledge.


7   Conclusion and recommendation

Conclusion:

The Environmental Impact Assessment of the Bypass at the Kampong Kdei has
revealed significant potential benefits of the project to the affected communities.
However, there are a number of areas of concern that need to be addressed to
minimize any negative impacts.

The key benefits include the preservation of the ancient traditional bridge for new
generation and tourism; the provision of improved social infrastructure to rural
areas as per government policy; increased economic activity along the bypass and




                                                                                   21

easier access to markets and other essential services for the communities along
the bypass route.

The potential negative impacts raised by the communities include dust, noise,
displacement and resettlement, depletion of natural vegetation, erosion and
sedimentation, and danger of accidents. However, these negative impacts can be
minimized or prevented through appropriate minimization measures as outlined in
the Environment Management Plan set out in the table in 7.1 above.

Recommendation:

   -  To avoid flooding of the bypass, the proposed bypass height would be
      constructed similar to RN 6 high level. It also commended to start
      implementation in dry season with low or no water in the stream where can
      be minimized ecological and physical impacts.

   -  To be avoiding flood at the areas of Thmey village, it requires improvement
      of the culvert system which drains to the low wetland areas. Residents here
      recommend that the bypass point across with this existing culvert water
      ensure least disruption to the natural drainage pattern.

   -  To reduce deforestation, engineer should consider preserving any trees that
      do not interfere unduly with the construction work.            A program of
      reforestation along the entire bypass should be undertaken following
      construction.

   -  As regards fish and other ecological issues during project construction, it
      would be better to start construction from the dry season while the stream is
      almost dried up.

   -  A study should be done to determine the type of traffic that can use the
      bridge after the construction of the bypass. Local residents would like to
      continue to use for light traffic such as small cars, motorcycles and bicycles
      while other heavy trucks can access to the new bypass. This would
      increase interest in the bridge rather than all traffic moving in the distance.
      To make the area more scenic, garden parks on both bridge sides are
      recommended.

                                    INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background

This socio-economic review was conducted prior to the construction of the Praptos Bridge
bypass to update the information from the social assessment study conducted by Oriental
Consultants Co. (OCC) conducted in 1999. The social assessment of OCC includes
historical background, population and social structure, economic activities and services,
history of the bridge and proposal for a site development plan. Since 1999, the government
has increased investment for an improvement of road number 6 passing the Praptos bridge
and consequently there has been an increase in the traffic from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap.
There is now a public transport "bus from Phnom Penh to Siem Reap" was started in 2002
and, although it is not yet very popular, it has lowered the transportation cost significantly.
The local tourist activities in the province have increased drastically since 2000. This
continually increasing business activities and traffic into future will likely deteriorate the
current poor condition of the Praptos bridge. The historical bridge needs to be conserved
and the alternative bypass bridge has been recommended by previous study and agreed by
the government for the bypass "B". The construction of new bypass bridge could have
positive and negative affects to the local communities living in the area, especially those
who need to be resettled.

The social impact assessment of National Road No. 6 has been conducted in 2001 and the
social assessment in Kampong Kdei and Kok Thlok Kaom communes has been conducted
in 1999 by OCC. Some information of the previous reviews remains unchanged such as
history and background information of the Pratos Bridge and Kampong Kdei district and
local tradition and are therefore has not been included in this review. This socio-economic
review is conducted to provide an updated data on socio-economic variable to monitor the
affects of the new bypass construction on the socio-economic condition of the two directly
affected communes (Kampong Kdei and Kok Thlok Krom).


1.2 Objective of the Study

The overall objective of this study is to confirm the social assessment of the Kampong
Kdei community made by OCC in 1999. This confirmation study results will be the final
information for the MPWT' decision on construction of the Kampong Kdei bridge and will
be served as baseline indicator for the impact monitoring of the bypass during and after
construction.

This study is focused mainly on confirmation of information on social assessment of the
Kampong Kdei by pass reported by Oriental consultants in October 1999. The report
covered the following areas:

        o The historical background (with a particular interest in the recent history of the
            bridge and the road).
        o An identification of the populations and social structure
        o Economics: Livelihood strategies



                                                                                            36

        o The bridge: traditions, practical use, environmental and land use
        o Recommendation for action

The six villages covered under this study are: Kampong Kdei II, Anglon Vil and Thmei,
Korkos, Krabei Riel and Kampong Kdai I. These villages are along the selected bypass "B"
as well as near the existing bridge.

1.3 Limitations

The wider affect of the bypass & bridge will be large and cover people living along the
road to Siem Reap and other business areas. However, this study covers only the areas
where the people may receive direct or very close indirect impacts in the bypass areas. It is
a review of the OCC' s report, which focused on confirmation of information and changes
of demographic and socio-economic status.

The study is conducted at the dry season therefore information regarding the traffic and
socio-economic activities during the raining season is based on memory record of the
interviewees and participants.

The study is for the monitoring of socio-economic activities, which exclude the poverty
mapping which could be an important indicator for the socio-economic development in
conjunction with the poverty reduction strategy and millennium development goal for
Cambodia.

1.4 Methodology for the Study

The approach and methodology of the OCC have been reviewed and taken into account for
designing the research methodology in order to make the results comparable. The historical
information has been reviewed and as by its nature, the information does not change over
the period, this therefore has not been included in the review's report. The useful
information for monitoring the affects of the bypass bridge is the current socio-economic
information in which the key indicators to be used as the baseline value of the Project were
identified.

As part of the development, the impact on the socio-economic development of the bypass
communities will be monitored together with other social infrastructure development. It is
suggest that the baseline socio-economic information of the OCC report will be used for
the impact monitoring for the fact that the road construction/renovation was started since
2000.

        1.4.1 Selection of bypass:

The option "B" has been already selected by the MPWT and the Apsara Authority.

        1.4.2 Selection of villages:

The purpose of the village selection is to make the result is comparable with the study
conducted by OCC and therefore the two communes covered by the OCC were selected
again for this study. Three affected villages and three nearby villages were randomly



                                                                                          37

selected for this study. The listing of the affected and non-affected villages has been
conducted prior to the fieldwork from which the households for interviews were randomly
drawn.

        1.4.3 Selection of Household

The households (HH) for discussions were selected following systematic random sampling
technique of every 5th house. The summary of the selected households are presented in the
table below.

The existing relevant documents reviewed were the OCC's report on Social Assessment in
Kampong Kdei and Kok Thlok Kraom communes, the Social Impact Assessment of the
Road Rehabilitation Project, The socio-economic study, Demographic Health Survey, and
other relevant reports. In addition, the scope of works have been discussed and agreed upon
by the MPWT.

The questionnaires for FGD, HH questions and village leader questions for discussion were
developed based on the reviewed information.

The data was collected by a team of two trained researchers: one facilitator and one note-
taker. The team were supervised by a senior researcher and assisted by a research
administrator.

Identification of the site was assisted by a staff from the MPWT. The remark columns
which were removed have been relocated for reference.

                                       CHAPTER II
           REVIEW OF THE POPULATION AND SOCIAL STRUCTURES

2.1 Demography

Demographic study of the OCC was conducted at four levels: at the provincial level,
district level, commune and village level. Since no updated information was available at
the four levels, only the current information at commune and village level have been
collected. The commune population records have been examined and confirmed by
respective village leaders.

2.1.1 Status of Population

Like elsewhere in the countryside, the life expectancy of this area is short, in general
shorter than 50 years old. Elderly person represents in a very small population in the area.
The reasons for this short life expectancy include professional accident, traffic accident,
lack of access to quality of health care services, lack of knowledge on health with low
education and occurrence of new diseases such as HIV/AIDS. It was reported that there are
women who died of HIV/AIDS.

The average size of the households in the two communes is 5.4, which is still high
comparing with their low household socio-economic profile. However, the population
within the most productive and active age (18 to 49) is increasing, indicating that the
productivity activities could be better with the appropriate interventional supports from
government, NGOs, or civil society.

2.1.2 Ethnical Issues

The original Khmer is on a par with Chino-Khmer and both categories represent about 95-
98% of the total population and ethnic Cham represent only about 2-5%. They all socially
communicate in Khmer except within their family where they may speak Cham or Chinese.
There is no severe or unsolvable conflict among the ethnic groups. Usually, their minor
conflicts are solved amicably by their groups or some time assisted by a respected person
in their village. All ethnic groups celebrate the Khmer traditional ceremony, for example,
Khmer New Year, Pchum Ben, Boat Racing and other activities. It could be concluded that
there is no major race conflict existing among the various ethnic groups.

2.1.3 Migration

The access to paddy land is becoming problematic for the younger generation as there is an
constantly increasing transformation of paddy fields to homeland. Previously, families used
to give part of its land heritage to the newly married in the family. Since there is an
increase of costs of land including paddy land due to an increase of business activities and
population growth, the young generation is facing problem in getting a paddy field and
they are trying to find other alternative businesses. Migration for work is gradually
increasing over the past five years despite an improvement of socio-economic conditions.
It was reported that in fact people prefer to work in their home district so that they can at
the same time provide care to their family. The decision to migrate for work is generally



                                                                                          39

not by their own choice. Many of them migrate for work only when there is nothing to do
in their village. Permanent migration has also been found in situations where they find
good business in Phnom Penh or in Siem Reap. Usually, a whole family leaves for other
provinces.

Family numbers in some villages decreased due to permanent migration to other provinces
or to Phnom Penh for their businesses. The total population of the two communes
increased from 22,417 in 1999 to 22,772 in 2003 (about 1.5%). The low population growth
in these two communes in comparison with the national data (2.5% per annum) could be
explained by immigration and, possibly, high mortality rate.

2.2 Social Activities

2.2.1 Social Issues

Young people seem to be creating more problems than the other age groups. They have
formed groups of what locally so-called Krom Steay who create conflict among their group
and others. Some of them ware reported as having joined the group because they have low
education and jobless. The improvement of business opportunity, rural infrastructure, and
primary and secondary education would help to reduce the numbers joining these groups.

Except for Kampong Kdei 1 which is considered as having better off educated people,
violence in families seem to be a common social problem. The violence usually happens
for reasons such as conflict after drinking liquor, jealousy, losing money from gambling,
poor living condition, and joblessness. People who do not have jobs usually spend their
free time discussing on other families' issues which sometime create problems.

It was also noted that there is a change of attitude toward serving alcohol drink for party
such as local liquor, beers, fermented palm juice. This type of party was not popular during
the period before 1990 due to the insecurity and getting people together was very difficult
and sometime was very suspicious by the security institutions. The majority of road
accident and social conflicts occurred after happy times. These problems may be prevented
by an increase of social education, which is a ongoing effort of the current government
agencies and NGOs.

2.2.2 Local Association and NGOs

Six villages have recorded the activities of associations or NGOs who are supporting the
villages. Those are presented in the table below:

     Villages name        Association/NGO           Activities

2.2.3 Schooling

The number of children attending primary school has increased over the past five years due
to an improvement of local infrastructure in the area. Transportation means have also been
developed which has improved access to schools.

In Korkos village there are 30% of children under school age who could not attend school
because their families are very poor. This is a very high un-attendance rate among the six
visited villages, which needs to be considered as a top priority of the village to seek
support from NGOs or the government. It is also noted that there is are NGO's or
associations supporting Kor Kos village.

   Krobei Real                   0.5               3.5                     No


2.2.4 Water Supply

All villages visited expressed the same water problems especially in the dry season.

Water prices in the dry season, especially from February to May, are very expensive.
Depending on the distance to the water sources, the price of water varies from R2500 to
R6000 per m3 which is too high comparing R350 to R600 per m3 (depending on quantity
used) in Phnom Penh. If they want to bring water by their own means from ponds or wells,
they need to spend at least half an hour. Children also assist in collecting water. About 15%
of children in the village did not attend school, which is very high comparing with other
villages in the commune. There is somehow a linkage between the source of water and
children attending school.


                                                                                            42

2.2.5 Health Problems

The most common health problems in the areas are:

    1. For children: diarrhea, acute respiratory infection, fever, cold, dengue fever (at the
        raining season), and conjunctivitis (in particular at after Khmer New Year and
        beginning of the raining season). Majority chose private health provides as the
        primary treatment for these disease for the fact that they are close to their house and
        can access services quickly.
    2. For adults, the common diseases are: fever, flue, fatigue, dizziness indicating that
        the level of health education is still low and people may not consume enough
        energy foods or vitamins.

Private health services are reported to be the important primary place for the people for
treatment of common diseases. The public Health Center and Referral Hospital are not
used so much as they are a little far away from the villages and transportation and
opportunity costs are high. People consider opportunity cost as travel time, need to wait for
services, and the loss of time spend on productive works (people who bring patients to
hospitals are generally people who are responsible for generating income for the family or
household heads who are busy with other homework). In addition, there was a report of
unsatisfactory behavior of health staff with patients - "health staff are polite only with rich
person/family".

Road improvements is one factor for improving accessibility of health services. However,
at the same time the government needs to strengthen the health services at referral hospital
or health centers and make it available for 24 services. The health expenses for private
sector seem to be higher than it should be if the public health system is strengthened.

2.2.6 Transportation
In general the transportation means have been improved over the period from 1999. Of the
six visited villages only one village, Korkos, has limited transportation means. The lack of
transport may result in low school attendance for children and other business activities. Kg.
Kdei 1 and 2 have better transport systems than the other villages.

It is expected that the transport means will improve following the improvement of the
socio-economic conditions.

2.2.7 Energy sources

There is a scarcity of energy resources in the region. No villages visited, except in
Kampong Kei market, have access to electricity. People use the candle light, kerosene
lamps, or other local types for lighting. Hiring generator cost very high and this happen
only for party, social ceremony and weeding.

Most of families use firewood and charcoal as the principal sources of energy for cooking.
The cost of the firewood is about from $3 to $7 per m3 and charcoal is about $0.06 to $0.07
per Kg. Some people collect fired woods or produce charcoal by themselves from jungle.
"Ponror Leu about 30 Km from village or Prey Tap Siem". They need to spend whole day
for collecting firewood ¼ m3 from jungle. They are aware that, in terms of opportunity
cost, they lose their time in collecting firewood but if they do not do that, they have no
other options.


2.3 Business/ Income Generation

Business activities in Kg. Kdei district are growing gradually since there has been an
improvement of infrastructure in the area.

       Business                         Monthly Revenue

       Hair cut                         $15


2.3.1 Kampong Kdei Market

The construction of the new market was completed and the business activities have been
slightly increased especially during and after road construction/renovation. Local people
considers it as a big market and it creates a lot of competition as the number of sellers has
increased. Buyers are happy with the new market for the fact that this promotes choices of
products and reduced prices. Before the road construction, the prices of products in the area
were more expensive compared to those in Phnom Penh or Kampong Thom.

The local vegetables are available but seem insufficient compared with the needs, sellers
buy vegetable from other market to sell at Kampong Kdei market.

2.3.2 Daem Poth Market

This older market still exists and the business activities have been increased from the
activities in the afternoon only to selling both mornings and afternoons. This market is
mainly for selling local food such as vegetables. Some imported goods with lower price
have been disposed in the small market.

2.3.3 Repair Services

There has been an increase of repair services including radio, TV, car, bicycle, motorbike,
and others such as hair cut, tailors, and master of ceremony (wedding). These were
increased in the past five years due to an increase of local means of transport and
improvement of business communication. People expect that their businesses could be
more profitable if the road condition is improved (both national road and secondary roads).

2.3.4 Agriculture

The rice production depends almost 100% on the rainfall. The land fertility is also a
problem, they need to use fertilizer to improve their rice production, which makes the
production cost very expensive. The average yield per hectare averages about 1.5 tons,
which is also about the average of the rice yield for the country.

Fishing can be done only in the rainy season, whereas in the dry season, fishing is only
possible far from the villages.

There are some small amounts of land with irrigation system in the communes. However,
according to the FGD results, people produce rice only one time a year. The irrigation
system is useful for a temporary complement to the rainwater.

Rice types:

Short-term (about 3 months):
Pkamalish Chao Y Pdao, Phkar Romchang, Phkar Romdoul, Sen Pidor, Phkar Rumchek,
Nang Meng and Nang Mon.

Medium and Long Term (from 4 to 6 months):
Nang Kung, Chong Banla, Prambei Kour and Phka Doung.

The long-term rice types are more productive than the short-term. Local fertilizers are most
commonly used for the rice production. However, it was noted that there is an increase in
utilization of synthetic fertilizer for the richer people because it yields better. People are
concerned that the use of the synthetic fertilizers will have negative impact on environment
such as harder land, diminishing fishes, frogs and other creatures who live off the soil.

Vegetables:

Farming includes production of sweet potato, cucumber, watermelon, corn, mango, banana,
guava, and green been. However, the production is only secondary to the rice production.
Income generated from this farming is quite small. Many vegetables are brought from the



                                                                                           45

provincial town or from other districts. Some families grow vegetables for their family not
for selling in the market.


Economic Problems

The very poor people are facing almost every year a shortage of rice, especially during
October and November. Those people borrow rice from their relatives or neighbors with a
very high interest rate. It was mentioned that if one family borrows rice this year the
repayment is double for next year because of high interest charges. Villages located far
away from national road or from big market are facing economic problems, especially
Korkos village.


2.3.5 Feeding crocodiles

Unlike other area where people feeding fish in their private small ponds, people in this
commune feed crocodiles. Out of 12 families feeding crocodiles, only one family feeds
fish. Crocodile business is more lucrative than fishery but it requires more capital
investment. Price of crocodile varies from $30 (for small crocodile) and about $1200 for
(pregnant crocodile). Only the richer family can do this crocodile business.


2.3.6 Other Businesses

Other businesses are also functioning very well and generate moderate incomes. Those
include: Pig slaughtering, food sellers, local trading of various goods, sellers of
construction materials, rice mills, taxi driver, koyjun drivers, and construction workers. In
general a construction worker get about R90,000 (USD22.25) per month which is not
sufficient to support their daily expenses.

Note: Most families are engaged in many different types of business - for example the
husband works as construction worker and grows vegetables and wife sells some goods in
a small local shop or market.

2.3.7 Child Labor

It was reported that there are children earning money through serving as waiters at
restaurants, house maids for young girls, selling of small goods/cakes with an average daily
income of not more than R2000, guarding cars/motorcycle at markets or when there is a
big ceremony. The income from these jobs can contribute very little to their family day-to-
day expense. This child labor results in low school children, under weighted children, and
they acquire more diseases and accidents. It was mentioned that child labor is also a cause
for using addicting drugs because they stay together and they can imitate each other
without control easily. Child labor could be reduced through social intervention on
improving access to education.

           condition.
        ·          Men and women over 15 years old illiteracy: drop out case and
           accessibility to school services.
        ·          Irrigable land: improvement of agriculture knowledge and practice.
        ·          Use of fertilizer and insecticide: change in agriculture practices.
        ·          Social insecurity: level of social education and strengthening of social
           security system.
        ·          Conflict in land property: clear definition of the land property and

                                          Chapter V
             Perceived Socio-Economic Impact and Future Development


5.1 Perceived Socio-Economic Impact of the Bypass

People in the area perceive that the bypass will promote economic growth through
improved communications, encourage more external assistances from NGOs, encourage
investment (local), improve infrastructure such as facilities for education, health and
other administrative offices. People indicated that they will spend less time for accessing
all public and private services, especially time spent for traveling to markets.

The two communes visited, Kok Thlok Krom and Kompong Kdei are ambitious in
developing their commune development plans for 2004 and their three year rolling plan
until 2006. Their plans include renovation of secondary roads, repair of small dams, and
other social activities. They expect NGOs and government will increase funds to support
these development plans.

There was also a perceived potential negative impact in that the people think that an
increase of traffic activities will increase road accidents and result in a lot of noise. Land
will be come more expensive for the younger generation to own land property. In future
many people may sell their land and resettle in the cheaper land areas, which will be
farther from the main road.


5.2 Future Development

The commune development plans for Kg. Kdei and Kok Thlok Krom communes
suggested that in order to ensure sustainable development in the area, the commune
development plans shall be used as a basic guiding principal for comprehensive district
and provincial development plans.

        Business activities

The current market location is good for business activities. However, this should be
organized to facilitate passengers/tourists for their shopping (they have a short time to
stop by for shopping of local products). The drainage and sewerage system should be
built and maintained regularly to avoid flooding around the market area.

        Water

Ground water is the major source of water in the dry season. As the cost of a drilled well
is very high for the villagers, a subsidy from the government or external funding
assistance is critical for accessing the good quality water with reasonable cost. The
estimated number of drilled wells needs for each commune has been included in their



                                                                                            53

commune development plans for 2004 and three year rolling plan 2004 to 2006. Water is
one of the major causes of poverty.


        Tourism activities

A parking area for viewing the ancient Praptos Bridge should be placed in very suitable
location. This location should be defined in close consultation between the district
authority and the architect. The local products shall be promoted to capture the interest of
tourists.

        Secondary roads

In addition to the development of the national road, the secondary roads for the benefits
of local people should be the priority to improve socio-economic conditions.

        Education and Health

Some primary education facilities are in very poor condition and need major
renovation/reconstruction. The primary school should support gender equity, for example
providing toilets for schoolgirls.

        Agriculture

Improvement of canal irrigation for the small-scale paddy rice and vegetation production
is, prima facie, a prime concern for the socio economic development. The community
plan for restoration of the canal irrigations should be supported.

6. Conclusion

The main conclusion reached from this review is that it largely confirms the results of the
study conducted by Oriental Consultants Company in 1999. The people are positive
about the proposed rehabilitation of the National Road 6 and have no opposition to the
plans for the bypass of the Kompong Kdei ancient bridge. Rather they tend to highlight
the general development needs of their communities. These needs are still extensive and
will not be fully addressed by the rehabilitation of the national road only. There is a need
for complementary projects by either government or non-government agencies to address
the issues secondary roads, water supply, health and social problems that exist in the
villages. These issues have been examined and recorded in detail through the commune
development planning process but so far there has been little done to solve the many
problems raised. Nevertheless the people remain hopeful and are ready and willing to
participate in any relevant development projects proposed for their communities
