CREDI1 AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           Republic of Senegal
Benefiela=:         Ministries of Health and Social Affairs; Economy, Finance
and Planning; Interior; Youth and Sports Services; Women
Credit AmL nt:      SDR 25.4 million (US$35.0  illlion equivalent)
Ten:                Standard, with 40 years maturity
Deseriftion:        The objectives of the proposed project are to support Government's efforts to:
(i) control fertility and reduce the rate of population growth, through the
implementation of a National Population Program; and (ii) restructure the
health sector to enable it to provide basic health services of improved quality
and wider accessibility, through the implementation of its National Health
Policy. To achieve these objectives, the project would finance investments for
(a) population to: (i) strengthen the National Family Planning Program;
(ii) promote the status of women; (iii) sensitize youth on family welfare
issues; and (iv) strengthen institutional capacity to promote the national
population program; and (b) health to: (i) develop the district health
system, including the promotion of community health organizations;
(ii) promote the use and availability of essential drugs; and (iii) strengthen
institutional capacity in the health sector, with emphasis on manpower
development, and budgeting and financial planning.
While the project is a specific investment operation, it will involve the
adoption and implementation of key policy measures in both the population
and health sectors including: (i) liberalization of regulations on contraceptive
distribution and use; (ii) adoption of organizational norms for the district
health system, ensuring sufficient budgetary allocations, personnel
redeployment, and adoption of organizational and procedural guidelines for
community health associations; and (iii) promotion of essential drugs.
Beniefits and
Risks:              The population component would have broad benefits in terms of increased
awareness of population issues and increased receptivity to family planning,
especially among women in rural areas and youth in semi-urban areas.
Family planning services would be extended to over 350 health posts in the
country (from an insignificant number at present), and over 150 practitioners
and pharmacists in the private sector would be able to offer services and
information. Government's ability to coordinate, implement and evaluate
population-related action programs would be strengthened. As a result of the
above package of services, the contraceptive prevalence rate should rise from



the present level of 3.4% to around 14% by 1995, providing the momentum
required for an increase to around 22% by the year 2000 - assuming the
necessary level of effort is maintained. Restructuring measures in the health
sector would help reduce unit costs of basic health care, making possible a
significant improvement in quality and coverage with relatively minor
increases in resource allocations. The exact value of these cost savings is
difficult to quantify. They would include savings on the cost of drugs (around
50-75% decrease in cost per episode), scale economies derived from
integrating vertical programs into the standard service package for health posts
and health centers, and savings on hospital costs of primary cases pre-screened
at the post and center levels. Increased mobilization of private resources to
cover the cost of health services would improve the long-term sustainability of
gains in quality and coverage and increase accountability within the health
service system. The health compQnent would benefit most of the population
through improved availability of drugs and quality of services which would
increase utilization rates in about half of existing facilities by as much as three
times current levels. In addition, over three million peopie in three regions in
the project's zone of concentration would gain improved access to basic
services through a 30% increase in the number of health posts in these
regions. Although the project makes no direct investment at the hospital
level, hospitals will be relieved of present excessive demand for basic care as
a result of improved primary- and secondary-level services and hence be
better able to provide specialized services.
Tlhe main risks are: (a) the complex nature of the project and consequent
expected implementation difficulties; (b) the many different changes required
in policy orientation of the Government at the macro level, and in the
behavior of service providers at the field level, and the possibility that these
changes may not occur at the desired pace; and (c) heavy dependence on local
health committees for resource mobilization at the health post level, and the
difficulty of ensuring their efficient operation. To minimize implementation
risks, close attention has been given during preparation to definmng
implementation arrangements and inter-ministerial working relatonships; the
project will, however, require more than average supervision. k;xtensive
policy discussions during preparation within the Government and between the
Government and IDA (and including other donors) improve the chances of
continued Government commitment to its newly adopted policies. To
minimize risks stemming from the "human element" in service providers,
close attention has been given to supervision and training aspects of all
components. Special efforts to improve management of community health
organizations (including revision of internal regulations, and training for
health personnel on supporting their development) and information campaigns
aiming to clarify the role of these organizations to the general public would
improve their chances of success.

HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Population and Health
I. INTRODUCTION
1 .1         The Government of Senegal has requested IDA's assistance in financing a project to help
achieve its goals for human resources development. Total project costs are estimated at US$37.9 million.
The Government would contribute about US$2.9 million. The remaining US$35.0 million would be
financed by IDA. The Basic Data Sheet and comparative indicators are found in Anmex 1.
1.2          The proposed project is the first of a series of operations to be developed under the
umbrella of a comprehensive human resources development program which constitutes a key element of
Senegal's medium-term social and economic development plan. The proposed project focuses on the
population and health sectors; a second project, scheduled for FY92, will focus on the education and
training sectors. Both projects aim to maximize quality of and access to basic social services through a
clearer definition of sectoral priorities, strict adherence to these priorities in the allocation of rescerces,
improved relevance in the content of services delivered, greater operational efficiency, and the
mobilization of additional resources, public and private. These objectives would be attained through a
combination of policy reform measures and investments to support the adopted reforms.
1.3          The proposed project would be IDA's second intervention in the development of health
services in Senegal. The first project did not include any significant investment in the population sector,
thus the present project is IDA's first intervention in that sector. Policy measures and investments
included in the project have been developed through extensive dialogue with Senegalese authorities based
on a Population Sector Memorandum (June 1987), and through discussions leading to the preparation of
the National Population Policy (April 1988) under the third SAL and of the National Health Policy (June
1989) under the ongoing Rural Health Project (Cr. 1310-SEN). Donors involved in both the health and
population sectors have participated actively in policy and program formulation. Experience in
implementing policy and program activities under the ongoing project has also been applied.
II. THE POPULATION AND HEALTH SECTORS
A. Population: A New Policy and Action Program Taking Shape
1. Sectoral Background
2.1          The National Population Program. Senegal's population totalled 6.9 million according
to the 1988 census, and is estimated to be growing at 3.2% p.a. (up from 2.4% prior to 1975). Prospects
are bleak for a significant decrease in this rate by the year 2000, given continued reductions in the death
rate (1.2% projected for 2000, compared with 1.9% at present), unless a reduction in fertility takes place.
Increasingly concerned by these prospects and their impact on the country's future social and economic
performance, Government adopted a comprehensive Population Policy Staternant in April 1988, calling
explicitly for reduced fertility and setting out a multi-sector strategy to attain this objective. While not
setting specific demographic targets, the policy statement presents two scenarios for Senegal's



-2-
demographic transition: a low-growth scenario which calls for a contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) of
29% to reach a rate of natural increase (RNI) of 2.87% in 2001, and a medium-growth scenario calling
for a CPR of 15% for a RNI of 3.21% in the same year. The conclusion drawn is that a 'significant"
decline in fertility is necessary if development efforts are to remain unshackled by excessive population
growth.
2.2           Since adoption of the national policy. Government has defined a US$85 million Priority
Action and Investment Program (PAIP) designed to give a major impetus to ongoing population and
family planning activities. Among the key elements of the PAIP is the definition of a National Family
Planning Program that sets quantitative objectives for tl- short and medium terms - CPRs of 14% by
1995 and 22% by 2000 1 -- and defines a coherent framework for all family planning (FP) activities in
the country. The magnitude of the effort required can be seen in perspective by noting that CPR was
estimated at only 2.6% in 1986, compared with a rate of I % in 1978. Not limited to family planning
activities, however, the PAIP includes a cross-sectoral range of actions that would help transform the
social and economic environment to favor more rapid fertility decline (including improved maternal and
child health, promotion of women's status, increasing involvement of youth, improved employment
opportunities, and population-related legislation). The multi-sectoral nature of the PAEP signifies an
important evolution in official attitudes towards population-related actions, from a narrow concern for
the effects of high fertility on the health of mothers and children, to wider concerns for family welfare
and national development objectives. Adoption of the program and actions takea so far by the
Government to initiate implementation of the policy (public information campaigns have been stepped up,
family planning effcrts intensified) make Senegal one of the more advanced Sahelian countries in terms
of its outlook on population issues.
2.3           Family Planning (FP? Activities. First introduced in 1970 in a private clinic, modern
contraceptive services have become increasingly available over the past two decades. In 1974, the
Senegalese Family Planning Association (Association senegalaise pour le bien-8tre familial - ASBEF),
an affiliate of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), was created, opening a PP clinic
in Dakar. The first puMlicly-run FP center opened in Dakar in 1975. With the establishment in 1981
of the USAID-funded Family Health and Population Project (Projet Sante Familiale et Population - PSFP)
covering six regions, FP services became available on a larger scale. That project is now in its second
phase (through July 1992). Mole recently, the UNFPA-funded Family Welfare Project (Projet Bien-Etre
Familial - PBEF) has undertaken expansion of services in the four remaining regions (1988-1992). The
first officially-sponsored attempt to offer services outside the public sector was initiated in 1985 through
the Private and Parapublic Sector Component (Volet Secteur Prive et Parapublic - VSPP) of the PSFP.
This component, which aims to introduce FP services in clinics serving large private and parapublic
enterprises, has covered 45 clinics to date, serving 4,158 contraceptors as of June 1990. A growing
number of NGOs, including ASBEF and Pathfinder Fund, have become involved in various aspects of
family planning service delivery and IEC. In July 1990, an NGO called Sant6 de la Famille (SANFAM)
was organized to continue private sector activities initiated under the VSPP.
2.4          Because of the still widely respected pronatalist tradition and the general lack of
knowledge about FP methods in Senegal, even among health professionals, activities to promote FP and
to provide correct information regarding benefits and risks, as well as service availability, are essential
to the FP program. Information, education and communication (EC) activities to promote FP have to

date focused on: (i) training of health personnel, social development agents, and volunteer auxi'iaries,
who together constitute the principal channels for face-to-face communication on FP; (ii) production of
pedagogical materials for field personnel and promotional materials such as posters and tee-shirts; (iii)
production and diffusion of radio and television spots and other written and audio-visual material for the
mass media; and (iv) seminars o-i FP for local journalists. A highly visible and apparently successful
mass media campaign was carried out from July 1988 to June 1989. Most of these activities have been
carried out with support from the USAID-funded PSFP.
2. Issues in Family Planning Delivery
2.5          Knowledge. attitudes and practice. Important changes in attitudes towards family planning
have v en attained over the past years. The Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) of 1986 showed that
70% of women of childbearing age knew of at least one modern contraceptive method, compared with
only 23% in 1978. Two other surveys, conducted in 1986 and 1987, showed a favorable attitude of men
towards FP as a means to space births; however, there was almost unanimous opposition from men to
FP as a means to limit the number of births. The second survey also showed interest in FP among both
urban and rural populations. Without necessarily attributing causality, it is encouraging to note that these
changes have occurred during a period marked by efforts to promote FP through Cz-e-to-face
communication as well as through the mass media. However, contraceptive prevalence rates remain low
(in 1986, 10.0% for all methods combined: 2.6% for modem methods) compared to the level of
knowledge and the reported positive attitudes. Evidently, more intensive IEC efforts as well as more
extensive provision of FP services must be undertaken if the ambitious targets of the national FP program
are to be attained. In addition, the multi-sectoral approach of the PAIP, which goes beyond specific FP
activities to create the social and economic environment that would favor wider acceptance, is becoming
increasingly important.
2.6          FP Service Delivery. The number of centers/clinics offering FP services increased from
24 in 1984 to 90 in 1988; the number of FP acceptors served in these centers increased from 397 to
45,811 during the same period. These figures represent an impressive achievement and provide grounds
for optimism with regard to the feasibility of FP program targets, provided expansion of service delivery
continues and service quality is maintained. To date, service delivery in the public sector has focused
on health and MCH centers, located mostly in urban areas. Training of health personnel has been largely
limited to doctors and midwives in these centers, with only a small percentage of nuiqes trained. While
urban-based services must be maintained, even strengtlhened, to meet growing demand, expansion must
now turn towards serving rural communities, primarily through the network of rural health posts
(typically served by one nurse), village-level "cases de sant6" (served by a community health agent and
a "matrone") and, eventually, through other existing networks of social service or development agents.
At the same time, service delivery in urban areas could be strengthened through the establishment of new
FP clinics in key urban centers through the continued expansion of services in private and semi-public
enterprises (VSPP), and through the network of private health practitioners.
2.7          Institutional Issues. The recent government restructuring has combined responsibility
(within MOHSA) for both FP delivery and FP-IEC, thus simplifying the institutional zetup for program
management. Inter-ministerial coordination remains important, however, because implementation of FP-
IEC activities depends on a variety of communication channels: social development agents of the
Ministries of Interior (for women's groups), of Youth (for youth groups), and of Agriculture (for
farmers), and the Directorate of Social Affairs of MOHSA; the Ministry of Education (schools and



-4 -
functional literacy programs); and mass media channels of the Ministry of Coxmmunication and Culture.
It is essential that MOHSA, and in particular the Health Education Vnit responsible for FP-IEC, take
strong initiatives to develop and maintain working relationships with these ministries to maximize access
to its different target populations.
3. Government's Population and Family Planning Strategy
2.8          Government's population and FP strategies are embodied in the PAIP and the National
FP Program document. The key elements of these strategies include expanding FP-IEC and service
delivery, promoting the status of women, involving youth in population and FP efforts, reducing legal
and regulatory constraints to fertility decline, and strengthening sectoral leadership in population. These
strategies are described briefly below. The proposed project would assist Government in carrying out
key elements of this strategy. Official adoption of the FP Program document, as discussed and finalized
at negotiations, is a condition of credit effectiveness.
2.9          Developing FP-IEC. The Government's FP-IEC strategy aims to continue past and
ongoing efforts, with a particular focus on: (i) broadening and deepening research on fertility-related
behavior; (ii) linking FP-IEC to activities of interest to target groups such as maternal and child health,
functional literacy, and promotion of women, to facilitate its acceptability; (iii) standardizing operational
methods and messages, and improving coordination among different projects; (iv) optimizing resource
use; and (v) using a multimedia approach with mass media and face-to-fpe communication channels
operating in tandem. The objective is to have 80% of the population informed correctly about the
benefits of FP and about the existence and correct utilization of modem contraceptive methods by the year
2000. [In contrast to the 70% of women reported to "know of" a modem contraceptive method in 1986,
this objective stresses the importance of coffect information about contraceptives and their use.]
2.10         To implement this strategy, at least three important changes must occur. First, because
the proposed program will require a significant infusion of resources, it is necessary to instill greater cost
consciousness than is presently evident, thus the need for careful monitoring and evaluation of all aspects
of the program including assessment of the cost-effectiveness of various aprroaches. Second, there is
need to "professionalize" promotional efforts, perhaps learning from commercial marketing methods
which, like FP-IEC, also aim to change "consumer" behavior. This translates operationally into more
scientific "market" research, coordinated orchestration of messages sent through different communication
channels, and other similar methods used in commercial marketing. Above all, a strong locus for
leadership and professional expertise must be established. While the Health Education Unit in MOHSA
has some of the necessary technical competence in communication and production, it needs further
reinforcement in research and management skills if it is to take on this lead role for FP-IEC, in addition
to growing demands for its other services.
2.11         The interpersonal communication program involving social development agents and their
network of volunteer auxiliar'es demands particular attention. Considerable effort is being invested in
training these agents and auxiliaries in FP-IEC, and an ambitious expansion program is proposed. While
the training program is well developed, there is litde follow-up on implementatioa in the field and little
knowledge as to the impact of their activities. Anecdotal evidence indicates, for example, that logistical
constraints significantly curtail agents' mobility, hence their effectiveness. These operational aspects of
the IEC "delivery system" must be reviewed with a view to improviag efficiency and effectiveness.



2.12         Expanding Family Planning Services. Government proposes to speed up expansion of
FP services within the public health system. The immediate priority is to expand FP to the health post
level, of which there are over 600 at present. The objective of this strategy is to capitalize on the
interactions between FP and maternal and child health (MCH) by completely integrating these services,
in particular taking the opportunity to provide FP-IEC or offer FP services during other MCH contacts
(prenatal visi.s, vaccination, nutritional surveillance and education, etc.). Hence, increased credibility
of all MCH services at this level would be a necessary prerequisite for successful FP expansion. In the
long run, the objective is to "de-medicalize" FP service delivery, making contraceptive advice and
distribution available through as many channels as possible.
2.13         MOHSA is preparing to issue, by early 1991, a series of instructions clarifying
regulations on the prescription and distribution of contraceptives. A new version of the decree defining
MCH services wouIh .aiclude FP as part of the basic MCH package and authorize health post nurses
(HPNs) to distribute all types of contraceptives, except IUDs. Village health workers and "matrones"
would distribute condoms and spermicides; in addition, "matrones" would be allowed, upon completion
of appropriate training, to resupply pills after prior prescription. The proposed project will provide
assistance for training programs to accompany this liberalization of contraceptive distribution.
2.14         Finally, MOHSA recognizes its lack of sufficient resources to reach its ambitious FP
targets and the need to t-ke a stronger position on encouraging FP service delivery through channels
outside of public health facilities. Among key potential participants would be private medical and
paramedical practitioners, pharmacists and staff of pharmaceutical "depots" (to whom people often go for
advice on FP), non-health workers involved in the "social marketing" of contraceptives, and private FP
organizations such as ASBEF and SANFAM. Thus its role will have to expand from strict service
delivery to promotion and development of alternative FP channels. The proposed projet will provide
assistance for FP activities in the private sector.
2.15         Promoting the Status of Women. Recognizing that significant change in fertility rates
would require radical change in women's behavior, particularly in taking decisions regarding their
reproductive lives, the national population program calls for actions to improve women's status in society,
specifically calling for: improving schooling and literacy rates for women and girls; promoting technical
and professional training for women; organizing information campaigns for men and women on these and
related issues; diffusing technologies to alleviate women's domestic and agricultural chores; and
supporting women's groups, of which there exist over 3,600 at present. Some of these actions have been
included in the Action Plan for Women adopted during the Decade for Women (1975-1985) and
implemented with assistance from various donors and NGOs. These actions will receive additional
support under the proposed PAIP.
2.16         Reaching Young Men and Women. The Population Policy Statement correctly identifies
young men and women as key participants in the effort to change fertility behavior in the immediate and
long run. It thus calls for efforts to help mobilize their energies to contribute to their self-improvement
while participating more effectively in their country's development goals. The PAIP calls for
strengthening programs identified in the Ten-Year Action Pean fc YGU  -    c  "nurses, vocational
training, social and cultural facilities, vyn"th asociations - and combining these programs with informa.cX
and education programs fobrsdi on family welfare, safe sexual practices, and responsible parenthood.



- 6 -
2.17         Reducing Legal and Regulatory Constraints. The Population Policy Statement calls for
revising or fine-tuning legal and regulatory measures which could have an impact on couples' desired
number of children and their access to family planning information and services. A study conducted by
Government found that, in addition to inexplicit regulations directly governing FP and contraceptive use,
existing fiscal laws and social security measures also worked in favor of larger families. Beyond these
measures, the legal environment was found to be fairly liberal compared to other countries. However,
implementation of existing legal statutes was found lacking, due to the public's ignorance about their
rights and, for aspects concerning women, the "social-religious" interpretation made by officials
responsible for applying them. Government proposes to: (i) take immediate action to clarify regulations
on FP access (para. 2.13); (ii) further explore the socio-economic implications of revising specific fiscal
and related measures; and (iii) initiate information campaigns targeted at those responsible for making
and applying the laws audges, politicians, etc.) as well as those most affected by them (women, youth,
health personnel, etc.).
2.18         Strengthening Sectoral Leadership. "Population" is only beginning to take shape as a high
priority "sector" within the Senegalese administration and has yet to develop a strong locus of leadership
for policy promotion as well as for coordination of its multi-sectoral operational elements. The
institutional structure responsible for population-related activities is well-defined: the National Population
Commission (CONAPOP), serving as advisory body to the Interministerial Council on all population
matters; and the Division of Human Resources (DHR) in the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Plan
(MEFP), serving as Secretariat to the CONAPOP. This structure, which has successfully led the effort
to develop and adopt a national population policy and to define the PAIP, must now shift efforts towards
coordinating the implementation of a large, cross-sectoral action program involving around ten ministries
and numerous NGOs and dornor agencies. It must also lead the effort to gain legitimacy for population-
related issues by increasing their visibility and raising consciousness at the highest levels of political
leadership.
B. Health: A Sector in Need of Reform
1. Sectoral Background
2.19         Health Status. While significant improvements in mortality were experienced particularly
in the '50s and '60s, mortality rates remain high in Senegal. The death rate is 16 per thousand, and life
expectancy at birth is 48 years. These rates, while better than in the rest of the Sahel, are worse than
in most other African countries or in other countries at a similar income level. Infant and child mortality
predominate (86 and 113 per thousand, respectively, in 1986), with diarrhea, respiratory disease and
malaria as the leading causes of death and illness. Among adults, maternal mortality is a leading cause
of death for women of reproductive age. The high fertility rate is recognized as a major factor affecting
maternal and child health. Ironically, high fertility rates are, in turn, a consequence of high infant and
child mortality. Malnutrition is also a contributor to poor health. Senegal's serious nutritional problems
are not problems of overall food supply but rather of seasonality, infectious disease, and maternal
overwo.k. Cardiovascular disease, trauma and sexually transmitted diseases (STD) are also important
health problems. The Government is conscious of the potential threat of the spread of the HIV infection
and is taking active preventive measures to stem this threat through the implemantation of a medium-term
action plan on AIDS, with strong assistance from the international donor community.

2.20          The Health Service Sector. The public healti' system consists of administrative units and
health facilities under the direction of the Ministr3    Health and Social Affairs (MOHSA).
Administrative units are defined according to po.itico-administrative government units at the central,
regional and departmental levels (the latter are called "circonscriptions m6dicales"). Public health
facilities are organized in pyramidal fashion: (i) at the bottom of the pyramid, the hgaith post, which is
the first level of contact with the formal health system, but which may supervise a number of community
health units ("cases de sante" and "maternites rurales") staffed by community health agents (village health
workers and "matrones"); (ii) the second level, the health center, which is the referral level for the health
post and which may be linked with a maternal and child health (MCH) center; (iii) the regional hospital;
and (iv) the National Hospital System (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire - CHU) consisting of three
hospitals in Dakar. The "circonscription medicale', which consists of one to three health centers and all
health posts in a given department, is considered to be the basic operational unit at the periphery. In
1988, there were 1,400 "cases de sante" (1 per 5,200 inhabitants), 659 health posts (I per 11,500
inhabitants) and 47 health centers (1 per 142,300 inhabitants). Seven of the ten regions (excluding Dakar,
Fatick and Kolda) have a regional hospital.
2.21          The private health care sector is active but mostly concentrated in the Dakar Region.
There are 25 private clinics, 47 health posts, and 272 doctors/dentists and 32 nurses with private
practices. The private, non-profit sector runs one hospital and 85 health posts. Finally, several
government ministries offer health services to their particular constituencies; outstanding among these is
the HBpital Principal run by the Armed Forces Ministry and considered to be the best hospital in the
country. Large private and public enterprises also offer on-site health services, which are funded through
a social security-type system known as the Instituts de Prevoyance Maladies (IPM).
2.22         Drug Supplies. The pharmaceutical market is divided into a dynamic and growing private
sector, and a stagnant and inefficient public sector. The private sector consists of two local manufacturers
(SIPOA, which produces about one hundred products under generic form and in which government owns
a minority interest; and PARKE DAVIS); three importers-wholesalers; and around 120 pharmacies
(mostly in the Dakar area) and 140 commercial distribution points - Wd6pOts" - where drugs are sold
along with other commercial products (in Dakar and larger towns). The public sector consists of the
National Pharmacy (Pharmacie Nationale d'Approvisionnement - PNA), managed by MOHSA, which
supplies public health facilities and community health organizations. SIPOA has been the main supplier
vis-4-vis the public sector for all drugs it produces. Otherwise, the PNA supplies itself through the
international market (primarily French sources) and receives donations from international aid agencies.
Donated drugs also reach health facilities directly at all levels of the health pyramid. Finally, there is
an active black market in drugs.
2.23         Prices in the private drug market are controlled, based on a fixed margin on purchase
price. Smaller margins are allowed for a number of drugs on a "social list" in order to lower prices.
However, these smaller margins reduce the private distributor's incentive to carry "social" drugs and have
had the contrary effect of limiting availability. In addition, because the private market carries drugs
mostly in non-generic form, drug prices can be several times higher than they would otherwise be for
the least expensive generic equivalent.
2.24         Traditionally, all pharmaceutical needs of clients of public health facilities were met
through the public distribution system. Because of budgetary limitations and the growing needs of a
larger popula.ion, the public sector has failed to meet that need, and clients are turning to the private



-8 -
commercial sector. As a consequence, the private pharmaceutical market has grown, with annual sales
of about 15 billion CFAF; in contrast, the public sector budget for drugs is around 1 billion CFAF. To
the public, this has meant significant increases in the cost of health care, growing inaccessibility of drugs,
particularly in rural areas where there are few private commercial outlets, and declining confidence in
public health services. Furthermore, prescription practices characterized by frequent overprescription
and use of specialty rather than generic names contribute to increasing, unnecessarily, the cost of drugs
to health sector clients. Finally, although the Goverment has a stated policy on promoting essential
drugs and has had an official essential drugs list for several years, it has taken little concrete action to
date to implement this policy.
2.25         Helth Personnel. In 1988, there were 459 doctors in Senegal (1 per 17,000 population),
2,487 nurses (1 per 3,000 population), and 482 midwives (1 per 14,000). These numbers indicate a
shortage of doctors - relative to standard norms of 1 per 10,000, and of midwives (norm: 1 per 5,000);
however, nurses are present in satisfactory numbers (norm: 1 per 5,000). The majority of health
personnel are employed in the public sector, particularly in MOHSA. A census of public health
personnel counted, as of December 31, 1989, a total of 5,027 agents of whom 5% were in central and
regional administration, 31 % in hospitals (19% in national hospitals in Dakar), 42% in health centers and
health posts, and 22% in other specialized services. These figures do not include community health
agents and traditional midwives working in "cases de sante" who, in 1986, numbered 2,424. At the
health post and health center levels, there is a deficit of doctors and administrative personnel, but a large
excess of support personnel, both technical (nurse's aides, medical technicians, etc.) and non-technical
(janitors, etc.). Paramedicals (nurses, midwives and "agents sanitaires") are also largely in excess at
present, but this excess should be absorbed over the coming years if the number of health posts increases,
as needed to keep up with population growth. (See Annex 3-7 for a discussion of personnel allocation
issues.)
2.26         Forty-five percent of public health personnel are concentrated in Dakar, which has 22%
of total population. A large number of those personnel, however, are found in the different national
services and in the National Hospital. In fact, only 28% of health center and health post level personnel
are located in Dakar, indicating that Dakar, while generously endowed, is in fact less privileged than may
appear as far as basic care services are concerned.
2.27         Health Financing. The latest comprehensive analysis of health expenditures was done in
1981, when the Senegalese population spent about US$18 equivalent per capita on health. This figure
was in line with the average for lower middle-income countries like Senegal. Forty percent of health
expenditures originated in the ,rivate sector; public sector sources included the central budget (33%),
local budgets (9%) and foreign aid (18%). At the time, health expenditures constituted about 1.2% of
GDP, and private spending, about 1.4% of total private consumption expenditure, of which about half
went to drug purchases. Trends in funding sources for health have not been well documented since 1981,
except for central budget allocations. After dropping to an all-time low of 3.8% in 1986-88 from a high
of 9% in the early 1970s, MOHSA's share in the national budget has recovered in recent years, reflecting
Government's concern to protect social expenditures during this period of economic adjustment. A total
of 11.5 billion CFAF (4.7% of national budget) is commnitted in the revised FY90-91 budget. In spite
of this recent increase and because of overall budgetary constraints and an increasing population,
allocation per capita has decreased in real terms. In addition, data on actual expenditures show a growing
gap between budget commitment and actual spending, this gap reaching 15% in 1986-87. The shortfall



- 9 -
has mostly affected non-wage expenditures which, as a result, would have received only half of the
original commitment.
2.28          Not surprisingly, private spending on health increased rapidly during the 1980s. Drug
imports net of public sector consumption doubled, and the two private hospitals in Dakar remained filled
to capacity, their combined budgets reaching a level as great as the combined budgets of the national
hospital complex and the seven regional hospitals. Health insurance exists but on a limited scale - a
Social Security System for employees in the modem sector (IPM), and private insurance, mostly used
by expatriates - and little is known of the amount actually spent in these programs. Civil servants,
military personnel and students also have their own health facilities and subsidized access to hospitals.
2.29          Since the early eighties, Senegal has experimented with users' fees in basic health
facilities. Attempting to duplicate a highly successful experiment in Pikine, a suburb of Dakar, a network
of community health organizations - consisting of "Comites de sante" (CS) at the health post level,
"Associations pour la promotion de la sante" (APS) at the health center level, and "Associations pour la
promotion de l'hOpital' (APH) at the hospital level - was developed and codified under a ministerial order
dated February 25, 1983. Amounts collected have been low, representing less than 5% of total private
spending (over the past five years, fees collected averaged US$1 million equivalent per year or about
US$0. 15 per capita). There is every indication, however, that these contributions constitute the bulk of
funding for drugs reaching health posts since only a small amount of publicly provided drugs seems to
trickle down to these facilities at present. A disturbing factor is the apparent loss of momentum of these
associations, as evidenced by the decrease in amounts of funds mobilized since 1985.
2. Issues in Health Service Delivery
2.30          Performance of the Public Health Sector. Between 1978 and 1986, the number of
consultations registered in public health facilities decreased by 58.5%, the number of consultants by
35.8%, the number of hospital days by 67.3%, and the number of persons hospitalized by 22.5%. These
figures are even more striking given that, during the same period, Senegal's population grew by almost
25%, and the number of health facilities actually increased. The decline in utilization resulted from a
critical degradation in the quality of services at all levels of the health service system as a result of: (i)
insufficient recurrent resource allocation to the sector; (ii) inefficient use of available resources; and (iii)
a dysfunctional health service system.
2.31          Insufficient Allocation for Recurrent Expenditures.  The limitations in budgetary
allocations to the health sector (para. 2.27) have mainly affected availability of material inputs. Drug
shortages are severe at all levels, but especially at the lowest levels of the pyramid. Other important
inputs to health operations have been constrained: resources for the purchase of fuel and the maintenance
of vehicles, essential inputs for supervision of field personnel, are practically non-existent except where
project-related donor funds are available. Lack of supervisioa is a major cause of deteriorating service
quality. Finally, maintenance of physical infrastructure is similarly neglected, fuelling the constant
preoccu    n to reconstruct facilities.
2.32          Inefficient Use of Sector Resources. There are striking inefficiencies in the use of the
sector's principal resources: manpower, drugs, and financial resources. Certain types of health personnei
are in short supply (doctors and administrative staff) while others are present in excess (paramedicals,
technical specialists and support personnel). Deployment to rural health posts is particularly difficult;



- 10-
in 1989, around 5% of the 618 health posts were "non-functional" for lack of personnel. The lack of
clear norms on staffing needs and task definition for different levels of the health pyramid has resulted
in unsystematic allocation of personnel, unequal distribution of work load, and a lack of accountability.
Whiie norms for distmZI  level personnel have recently been defined, there is urgent need to define norms
for hospitals and other specialized structures. Insufficient equipment and drugs, as well as poor personnel
management practices have led to low productivity and widespread demoralization. There are also
fundamental problems in the basic training for medical and paramedical personnel which continues to be
modem-sector hospital-oriented, not adjusting to changing priorities in the sector nor to the realities of
conditions in the health service sector in the country.
2.33          Inefficiencies in the use of dr    stem from two basic problems: (i) non-cost-effective
prescription practices, including incorrect prescription, over-prescription, and excessive reliance on
expensive brand-name products where generics are available; and (ii) inefficient procurement, distribution
and storage practices at the National Pharmacy and in most health facilities. The National Pharmacy is
plagued with problems: chronic shortages of the most essential drugs, lack of qualified personnel (most
pharmacists prefer to work in the profitable private sector), inflexible financial and procurement practices
tied to the rigid public accounting and procurement systems, and overall weak management (see Annex
_-2). Personnel in health facilities are not trained in drug management, resulting in excessive losses due
to wastage and theft. While the private pharmaceu:ical sector is highly profitable, profits are made
largely on expensive brand-name and highly specialized drugs to the detriment of low-cost essential drugs
which would better serve public health objectives.
2.34          Financial management of the extensive network of health facilities is constrained by the
rigidities of the public budgeting and accounting system and by weaknesses in budget management and
planning. While budgetary allocations are defined for the basic operating units in the system - hospitals
and health departments ("circonscriptions m6dicales") - these units have little effective control over their
resources. Control rests with administrative units at the central level and, to some extent, at the regions,
which are largely unable to cope with the vast planning effort required. The annual budget exercise is
a mechanical process by which current allocation is rarely submitted to re-assessment. Any cuts caused
by shortages of funds are applied across-the-board with wages being protected. Budget sub-categories
are added on a case-to-case basis, to meet specific emergency or ad hoc needs. The budget has thus
become an heterogeneous list of items making the document ineffective to use as a tool for planning,
execution and control.
2.35          The large potential for community participation in health financing is also constrained by
poor management of CHO funds. In many cases, receipts from service fees collected by these
associations are either used to hire support personnel in excessive numbers, channeled to uses not directly
related to health service delivery, or hoarded for use as political war chests by local leaders; health
personnel are often not associated in decisions on the use of funds. Even where funds are made available
to purchase drugs, these associations are frequently obliged to buy high-cost (non-generic) drugs from
private sources because of chronic shortages in the National Pharmacy system.
2.36          Finally, poor financial management is manifest in the lack of oversight of resources
pouring into the sector from international donors and NGOs. There is no systematic effort to monitor
external resources: information on the nature, size or geographic distribution of resource flows from
individual projects/donors are not centrally maintained, much less information on the aggregate of all
contributions. Priorities are defined by individual donors rather than government and, because system-



- 11 -
wide norms on resource use do not exist, government is in no position to propose alternatives. There
is clearly much potential to channel extemal resources more productively.
2.37          Dysfunctional Health Pyramid. The health pyramid described in para. 2.20 above is not
functioning as it should. While some problems can be attributed to inefficient resource allocation, they
are also due to organizational flaws, the most prominent being: (i) absence of realistic and/or clearly
defined norms governing the functions assigned to each level of the pyramid, staffing patterns, individual
staff assignments, minimum resource needs, geographic coverage, etc.; (ii) undefined norms for
administrative, managerial and supervisory roles linking successive levels of the system; (iii) insufficient
distinction, de facto, between first line and referral levels, with most health centers unable to offer basic
surgery, laboratory and radiology services needed for effective referral; (iv) unequal distribution of health
posts, with a shortage in urban areas, resulting in excessive recourse to hospitals for even minor
problems; and (v) excessive reliance on vertical programs. In responding to the call for emphasis on
primary health care (PHC) services in the early 1980s, various special programs were established to
promote different elements of the PHC package (vaccination, MCH care, diarrhea management, family
planning, etc), lrgely with assistance from donors. These programs were mostly established with
separate, highly centralized management, supervision, and logistical systems, resulting in gross
inefficiencies in the use resources. There is need to integrate these services into the existing system,
which itself should develop into an efficient health pyramid able to deliver the minimum PHC package
through multi-purpose health posts in the first instance, and through efficient referral, supervision and
support at the higher levels of the system.
3. Government's Health Strategy
2.38          The National Health Policy. Over the past two years, MOHSA has made an exceptional
effort to reassess performance in the health sector and to plan reform in the health service system. After
extensive discussions within MOHSA and consultation with donors active in the sector, Government
issued in June 1989 a Declaration of National Health Policy defining principal strategic orientations for
the sector. The new policy presents a 13-point strategy for reform of which the key elements are:
(a)    increased participation by the population through CHOs and through the private and NGO
sectors;
(b)    rationalizing the use of drugs, as well as drug production, procurement and distribution;
(c)    promoting decentralization by strengthening the health district system, integrating vertical
programs, and improving support capacity at the central and regional levels; and
(d)    improving management of human, material and financial resources.
The policy statement also calls for institutional reform including the reorganization of MOHSA,
restructuring of the National Pharmacy, defining the legal status of community health organizations,
revising texts governing use of municipal funds earmarked for health, obtaining financial autonomy for
hospitals, greater budgetary autonomy for other health facilities, and restructuring of the system of
schools and training facilities in public health.
2.39          Efforts to further develop elements of the above strategy are ongoing, and advances have
been made in several key areas. These strategies are described briefly below and, where appropriate,
presented in detail in annexes to this report. The proposed project would assist Government in carrying



- 12 -
out key elements of this strategy, with focus on the district health system, drug availability, community
participation, and management and planning.
2.40         Developing the District Health System. Reform in the organization of basic health
services through the development of health districts Is the centerpiece of the sector reform program. The
"district", which would consist of a health center (serving a population of 150,000 to 300,000) and all
health posts within its zone of responsibility (around 15-30 health posts per district), would replace the
"circonscription medicale" as the basic operational unit in the system. While the latter is defined strictly
along politico-administrative lines, the district will also take demographic and geographic criteria into
consideration. Services at the district level will be reorganized on the basis of the following principles:
complete and equitable coverage of the entire population through the definition of "zones of
responsibility" for each health post and health center; clear delineation of tasks of the health post and the
health center and of staffing norms and resource needs; integration of vertical services into the appropriate
level of health facility; organization of a district management team and definition of its functions; and
organization of community participation through community health organizations. Forty-five districts
have been identified to cover the entire country. The proposed district health service system is described
in detail in Annex 3-4.
2.41          Comparison of new coverage norms with the existing network indicates a sufficient
number of health centers but a lack of health posts to cover the present population. In addition, health
posts are inequitably distributed, with an excess in some rural areas but with marked shortages in urban
areas. Health center and health post personnel would need to be redeployed to conform with staffing
norms (para. 2.44) and retrained on new technical and managerial skills required for the system. To
implement the proposed reforms, each district will prepare a District Health Development Plan (DHDP)
delineating zones of responsibility per health post, outlining an action plan for personnel reallocation and
retraining and for establishing improved management and service delivery systems, and describing
resource needs and funding sources. (3he DHDP is described in detail in Annex 3-6.) To ensure the
ultimate success of the district system, more efficient mechanisms to facilitate budget execution at the
district level, and hence to strengthen the district's budgetary autonomy, will be sought.
2.42          Promoting Essential Drugs. To meet its objective of improving the cost and availability
of drugs, MOHSA intends to operationalize its essential drugs (ED) program on a countrywide scale.
To this end, it has revised the official ED list, giving closer attention to cost-effectiveness in drug
selection and the use of generic names, and defined regulations for its application. These regulations
include the strict application of the ED list by the PNA, by all regional hospitals and district-level
facilities, and by community health organizations. A medium-term reform program for the sector will
focus on: (a) ensuring sufficient and timely financial flows from two principal sources - user fee revenues
and budgetary allocations - to support purchases of essential drugs for health system clients; (b)
improving procurement, distribution and management of EDs in the public health system through (i) a
reform of PNA, and (ii) improved drug management in public health facilities; (c) improving prescription
practices; and (d) informing the general population on the existence of lower-cost options for drugs'.
Although the medium-term focus of the reform would be the public distribution system, the strategy for
the longer run is to create a strong, open market for low-cost essential drugs involving both public and
private sectors. The demand- and supply-generation objectives of the medium-term program are pre-
conditions for eventually creating this market. In the long term, growing demand combined with other
incentives should encourage private pharmacies to carry essential drugs under their least expensive forms.
A long-term strategy for promoting essential drugs, including deflning PNA's role in the pharmaceutic-a-



- 13 -
market and identifying appropriate incentives for the private sector, will be the subject of a study to be
undertaken under the proposed project.
2.43         Promoting Community Health Organizations (CHO). Recognizing that Government alone
can no longer support the growing cost of health services, MOHSA intends to strengthen its partnership
with CHOs and improve their ability to mobilize and manage community resources. The immediate
priorities are to: (a) clarify the terms of the "contract" between Government and CHOs, stressing the
type of participation expected from the community and the nature of assistance to be provided by
Government (para. 2.49); (b) assist CHOs in setting a structure of user fees or seeking other funding
sources (including local governments) to meet their financial commitments; (c) define rules on
organization and internal procedures of CHOs to be applied nationwide to reduce misallocation and
improve management of funds; and (d) train District Medical Officers and Health Post Nurses to support
CHO development. A review of experience with CHOs over the past decade and of their current
problems shows the need for the following organizational and procedural changes: (i) granting legal status
to health committees which operate at the health post level; (ii) ensuring better representation in the
designation of representatives to the CHO general assemblies and the selection of CHO board members,
and periodic re-election of board members; (iii) giving first priority to operational expenditures of the
health facility in the use of user fee receipts; and (iv) establishing a system of co-management of CHO
funds raised through user fees, making the DMO or HPN a co-signer, together with a designated CHO
representative, on CHO fund withdrawals. The proposed revised structure of health organizations and
their organizing principles are detailed in Annex 3-10.
2.44         Manpower Planning. MOHSA recognizes that there is an urgent need to strengthen its
personnel management policies and is taking corrective measures to this end. Immediate priority has been
given to identifying reallocation and recruitment needs for basic health care. Upon completion of a
census of all health personnel and comparison of current deployment patterns to current needs and
projections for 1995 (to adjust for population growth), MOHSA has defined a redeployment and
recruitment plan in two phases: an emergency plan for FY90-91, and a medium-term plan for FY91-92
to FY95-96 (see Annex 3-7 for details). The FY90-91 plan calls for reallocation of personnel to: (a)
fill 60 of the 85 positions for doctors at the district level through redeployment, and make provision for
recruitment of the remaining doctors in the FY91-92 budget; (b) satisfy naramedical requirements in 565
existing health posts to be retained under new coverage norms and 44 health centers; (c) endow all
regional hospitals with at least one surgeon and one gynecologist; and (d) appoint or identify one
administrative agent (could be a paramedic, in the absence of a trained administrator) for each district.
This plan would involve the redeployment of 17 doctors and the recruitment of 25 new ones. Health
personnel recruitment is protected, within certain limits, under the SAL IV civil service restructuring
program, and the proposed recruitment would not exceed those limits.
2.45         The medium-term plan (1991-96) gives priority to the following actions: (a) assignment
of a nurse, midwife or "agent sanitaire' to each new health post as expansion proceeds; (b) redeployment
of support personnel at the health post level, possibly to be re-hired by local health committees through'
user fee revenues; (c) redeployment of personnel at existing centers and posts considered to be in excess
under new coverage norms and of all excess personnel in centers to be retained; (d) recruitment of a third
doctor in districts where the population exceeds 250,000 (about 13 districts by 1995) and of district
administrative personnel; and (e) definition of staffing norms for hospitals and other specialized structures
and subsequent reallocation, recruitment or dismissal of personnel following these norms. Personnel



- 14 -
allocation within and among districts will be a key element of district and regional development plaw
(para. 2.41).
4. Financing the District Health System
2.46         Cost of the District System. The proposed district health system, once in place, would
cost around 6.1 billion CFAF annually to operate: 3.4 billion for salaries, 1.8 billion for drugs, and 0.9
billion for other costs. These estimates are based on a population size of 8.7 million, the projected
population for 1995. They are also based on assumptions of improved levels of utilization and
operational efficiency as well as reductions in drug prices to international market levels, conditions which
are expected to be in place after implementation of district-level and drug sector reforms during the
period 1991-95. (These assumptions and others on which the following discussions are based are detailed
in Annex 3-8.) It is estimated1 that a total of 4.3 billion CFAF is currently available to fund the district
system, from two principal sources: 4.0 billion from the national budget (or 35% of total MOHSA
budget allocation for FY90-91), and 0.3 billion from user fees raised through community health
organizations. Of this total, 3.3 billion CFAF would go to salaries, 0.6 billion to drugs, and 0.5 billion
to other costs. Comparing current funding levels with projected needs for FY95-96 would thus indicate
a need to increase the overall level of resources for the district system during the years 1991 to 1995 by
1.7 billion CFAF, almost all of it needed for non-salary payments. The funding gap could be as much
as twice that amount, however, if no improvement in current drug prices and prescription practices are
realized.
2.47         The proposed financing plan for the district system for 1995 is summarized in Table 1
below. It takes into consideration the limited prospects for budget expansion in the medium term, as well
as the large potential for increasing user fees if the right conditions prevail. Hence, it relies heavily on
an increase in revenues from user fees, from 0.3 to 1.6 billion CFAF over the five-year period.
Government contribution to non-salary costs would increase from 0.9 billion to 1.4 billion CFAF. The
sections that follow describe how the proposed resource mobilization and reallocation will be
accomplished, for both user fees and budgetary contributions.

Other costs        (-)           0.09                 (e)
2.48         User Fees. At the health post (HP) level, user fees are expected to cover 100% of the
cost of drugs and of salaries for support personnel (45% of total cost, 76% of costs excluding the nurse's
salary), with Government budget allocations covering the nurse's salary and other operating costs. This
would amount to 1-3 million CFAF per year per HP, for utilization rates of 2,500-7,500 episodes per
year, and would correspond to an average client contribution of around 400 CFAF per episode. This rate
is higher than current rates of 250-350 CFAF but lies within what s considered to be affordable in
Senegal. Given the higher unit cost of services at the health center (HC) level, the share of client
contributions would be significantly less at this level, covering only 5% of total cost (12% of costs
excluding salaries). These contributions would be derived from fees to be charged for hospitalization
(1000 CFAF per stay) and from laboratory fees (250 CFAF per exam).
2.49         Under the proposed financing plan, client (or community) contributions are essential to
the functioning of the HP, and the organization of a local health committee to mobilize and manage the
required resources is a sine qua non for HP survival. In addition, sufficient resources must be mobilized,
whether from direct user fees or from other sources (ocal governments, etc.). If current practice of
relying on user fees continues, rates would need to increase to around 400 CFAF per episode. Finally,
revenues earned from user fees must be used appropriately, that is: (a) channelled back into HP
operations (and not hoarded or used for other "projects"), and (b) allocated appropriately between drugs
(at least 70% of revenues), salaries (around 25%), and other recurrent items (around 5%). These
elements will have to be included in the rules on CHO procedures to be adopted by the Government.
2.50         Although the share of client contributions would be smaller at the HC level, active
participation of the district-level association (Association pour la Sant6) is also required. In addition to
allowing participation by the client community in routine HC management, the association's involvement
would make it legally possible to retain receipts at the HC level without turning them over to the
Treasury, as would otherwise be required if fees were collected directly by the health facility.



- 16-
2.51         Budget allocations. The proposed total increase of 0.5 billion CFAF in budget allocations
for non-salary costs over the five-year period would represent an annual increase of around 1% per year
of total MOHSA budget allocations. If MOHSA's share of national budget allocation were allowed to
increase from its current level of 4.7% to around 7% by 1995 (the WHO-recommended level is 10%),
and assuming that the national budget remains at least constant (in real terms), the 0.5 billion would
represent no more than 10% of the total increase in MOHSA's budget and is hence clearly affordable.
The projected increase in MOHSA's budget would be in line with Govermment's stated policy of
protecting social sector expenditures during the current period of budget restructuring, and is being
proposed under the ongoing Public Expenditure Review.
2.52         The resource mobilization effort required of Government during the period under
discussion involves not only increased budgetary allocations for the district, however, but also measures
to ensure that the full amounts allocated are actually made available at the district level. This would
involve an effort to facilitate actual transfers from Treasury through MOHSA, to the district level, thus
strengthening the spending autonomy which presently exists at the DMO level. One priority measure
would be to present MOHSA's budget on a functional basis, distinguishing allocation for non-salary items
(separating essential drugs) for each of the 45 new health districts.
C. The Bank Group's Role
2.53         The Bank Group's involvement in the population and health sectors in Senegal includes
the Rural Health Project (Cr. 1310-SEN), signed on February 2, 1983, and assistance for the development
of the National Population Policy and the elaboration of the PAIP through SPPF funding. The adoption
of the population policy and the subsequent definition of an action program have gone a long way in
legitimizing the "population issue" in Senegal. The present project proposes to capitalize on that
momentum to accelerate the desired decline in fertility levels and hence, in population growth.
2.54         The ongoing Rural Health Project (scheduled completion is December 31, 1991) is the
Bank's first intervention in the health sector. Its objective is to provide technical, logistical and
management support for primary health care in rural areas in Senegal. It consists of five components:
(a) strengthening basic health services through the construction/rehabilitation of 9 health centers;
(b) upgrading training of health personnel; (c) improving the supply and utilization of basic drugs;
(d) developing health education services; and (e) strengthening planning and management capacity in the
MOH.
2.55         The project has had mixed success in attaining its objectives. Activities under the first
component contributed to completing coverage nationwide with respect to health centers. As a result,
infrastructure needs at that level are well met. However, the accompanying improvements in service
quality that were expected through the training and 'drugs" components have been less satisfactory, due
principally to two problems: first, implementation of these activities was long-delayed and sporadic,
causing significant differences between the project's targeted outputs and what has actually been
accomplished; second, specific training activities were selected in an ad hoc manner, rather than being
part of an integrated program with a well-defined strategy. Progress has nevertheless been made in the
development of a pharmaceutical sector strategy, including improvementr in the official list of essential
drugs, preparation of practical recommendations for the reform of the National Pharmacy and
recommendations for improvements in the cost recovery system. These reforms will be implemented
under the present project.



-17 -
2.56         Support to the Health Education Unit (HEU) in the MOH has helped to create a stronger,
more professional unit. This unit has, for example, been at the forefront of the highly-visible AIDS
prevention program. With its new responsibilities for FP-IEC, the HEU has assumed still another
difficult task. It is also expected to take the lead in developing and implementing public information
campaigns on essential drugs and on community health organizations. To help it better structure its wide-
ranging activities, the HEU is receiving technical assistance from USAID to prepare a general strategy
on health education. It will also receive material and technical assistance under the present project.
2.57         Finally, support for planning and management activities at the central level have also had
mixed results. An overly ambitious program to develop health planning (including the preparation of a
computerized macro-model for health sector planning which has had no practical application to date, and
the development of an elaborate methodology for the preparation of regional health plans) has been a
learning experience at best, the result of inappropriate technical assistance. Computerization of health
personnel data has been attempted with unclear results to date.
2.58         Rationale for IDA Involvement. IDA's involvement in the human resources sectors has
grown over the last few years, particularly with the increasing focus on human resources as a key asset
in development in the Sahel and on improved basic services (education and health) as essential to the anti-
poverty effort. In population, IDA's position as Government's lead partner in the macroeconomic
dialogue has provided the opportunity to maintain needed focus on the population question and its
relevance to the country's total development effort. This dialogue reached a watershed point with the
declaration of the national population policy under the third SAL. Satisfactory implementation of this
policy will require continued support, in collaboration with concerned donors, to help Government define
and mobilize the means to implement the Population Action Program. In health, preparation activities
of the present project have provided a vehicle to advance reflection within MOHSA and dialogue between
MOHSA and the donor community on much needed reform. Both the donor community and concerned
government agencies are looking to the Bank to maintain this position of leadership and ensure that the
momentum of reform continues and that sufficient resources are mobilized within and outside the country.
2.59         D)onor Assistance and Coordination. Many donors are involved in the population and
health sectors. UNFPA and USAID have been particularly active in the population sector. Recent
advances in that sector would not have been possible without these two agencies' continued presence over
the last decade in both areas of policy development and family planning operations. IPPF's affiliate in
Senegal, ASBEF, has been active particularly in Dakar, although it has kept a relatively low profile.
Besides their activities in support of publicly-provided family planning services, USAID has contributed
to private sector initiatives, UNFPA to youth-oriented activities, and both donors to Women in
Development (WID) efforts. UNDP and UNIFEM are also traditionally involved in the WID sector.
In health, donor participation has until recently been scattered and, for the most part, geographically- or
program-focused. A large number of donors are involved, including bilaterals (Belgium, France,
Germany, Italy and USAID), multilaterals (UNICEF, UNFPA, WHO, the European Community, the
Islamic Bank, the Arab Fund, and IDA), and NGOs (AFVP and World Vision). Much needed
coordination in both population and health sectors has developed gradually over the last two years with
UNFPA and Belgium serving, respectively, as lead agencies. Preparation of the present project has in
large part served as the stimulus for such coordination, with donor groups participating extensively in
discussions on policy and program elements of the project. This coordination has also facilitated dialogue
between Government and the donor community.

111. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives and Description
3.1          The project will support Government efforts to: (i) control fertility and reduce the rate
of population growth, through implementation of its National Population Program, following strategies
described in paras. 2.8-2.18; and (ii) restructure the health sector to enable it to provide basic health
services of improved quality and wider accessibility, through implementation of its National Health
Policy, following strategies described in paras. 2.38-2.45. While the project would be an investment
operation, it will involve the adoption and implementationi of key policy measures in population and
health including: (i) liberalization of regulations on contraceptive distribution and use; (ii) measures In
support of the district health system, including adoption of organizational norms for the district, ensu c1ng
sufficient budgetary allocations, personnel redeployment, and adoption of organizational and procedural
guidelines for community health organizations; and (iii) measures to restructure the health sector towards
the promotion of essential drugs.
3.2          As appraised, the Government's five-year Human Resources Development Program would
include investments organized in two parts: population and health.
3.3          For population, the program would:
(i)    strengthen the National Family Planning Program through (a) expansion of FP services
in the public health system, (b) extension of FP services through private sector channels;
and (c) promotion of FP through information, education and communication (Base cost:
US$4.8 million);
(ii)   promote the status of women through (a) functional literacy training; (b) extension of the
network of "cases-foyer" (centers for local women's group activities); (c) provision of
labor-saving equipment for household work; and (d) institutional strengthening of the
Women's Ministry (Baseco : US$7.1 million);
(iii)  sensitize youth on family welfare issues through Family Life Education programs (Mms
M: US$2.0 million); and
(iv)   strengthen institutional capacity to promote the national population program through (a)
population research and information dissemination; and (b) strengthening capacity for
monitoring and evaluation (Base cot: US$0.6 million).
3.4          For health, the program would:
(i)    develop the district health system through (a) development of training programs for health
district personnel; (b) development of financial management systems for districts; (c)
promotion of community health organizations and (d) assistance for implementation of
district development plans in the regions of Dakar, Thies and Diourbel (Base cost:
US$17.6 million);



- 19 -
(ii)   promote the use and availability of essential drugs through (a) reform of the National
Pharmacy; (b) supply of an initial stock of drugs for health districts; (c) information
campaigns for prescribers and the public; and (d) development of a long-term strategy
for the pharmaceutical sector (Base cost: US$4.8 miiiienI); and
(iii)  strengthen institutional capacity in the health sector, with focus on managing manpower
development, and budgeting and fi. ancial planning (Baseost: US$0.5 million).
B. Part I: Implementing the National Population Policy
1. Strengthening the National Family Planning (FP) Program
3.5           This component will support implementation of the National Family Planning Program.
In complement to activities under other ongoing projects, particularly two major ones funded by USAID
and UNFPA, it aims to increase contraceptive prevalence rate in Senegal to 14% by 1995 and expand
the delivery infrastructure to allow continued increase in FP acceptance beyond 1995 (to 22% by 2000).
It has three sub-components:
(a)    Expanding FP services through the public health system
(b)    Extending FP services through private sector channels
(c)    Promoting FP through information, education and communication (IEC)
Activities of this component are described in dettail in Annex 3-1.
3.6           Expnd!ug FP Services through the Public Health System. The USAID- and UNFPA-
funded projects have so far given priority to establishing FP services at the health center (MCH center)
level and building capacity at the national level to plan and manage a national program. This program
would extend the accesmibllity of services to the health post (HP) level, thus representing a major effort
to expand FP coverage  by taking them one level further down in the health service pyramid. In keeping
with Government's stiategy for FP delivery, a fully-integrated MCH-FP package will be offered at the
HP level. Around 720 FA-s in both urban and rural areas will offer the MCH-FP package by the end of
the program period. To aacomplish this objective, program activities will include:
a)    Training in. UP for 720 health post nurses (HPN)
b)    Provision (if contraceptives to meet 25% of national needs
c)    Support foi Iv CH and nutrition activities at the HP level
d)    Improving M,C;I/FP instrction in Schools of Public Health
3.7           Training of HPNs 'In FP will focus on: (i) contraceptive techniques for all methods except
IUDs, for which clients would be referred to the health center; (ii) FP counselling; (iii) promotion of FP
during other MCH service con acts (pre-natal visits, vaccination, nutritional surveillance and education,
curative services, etc.); and (iv) follow-up of FP acceptors. In keeping with Government's strategy to
develop a unified approach to FP activities, the program would assist in the development of a standard
set of training modules to be used throughout the country, pulling together materials currently being used
in ongoing projects. The standardized modules would be discussed and finalized at a national seminar
(to be held in PY1) at which representatives of different projects and donor agencies, as well as MOHSA
staff, would participate. Training of HPNs would begin in PY2 (see An=  3-5 .



- 20 -
3.8          Contraceptives will be provided to supplement supplies expected through ongoing
UNFPA- and USAID-funded projects, which would meet around 75% of national needs. A standard list
of contraceptives (types of pills, injectibles, etc.) has been drawn up by MOHSA and agreed on by
UNFPA and USAID. This list has been integrated into the official list of essential drugs. Project-
supplied contraceptives will be selected from this list.
3.9          An important pre-condition for the rapid expansion of FP is the liberalization of
regulations on the distribution and use of contraceptives. To this end, MOHSA has recently issued
instructions to (i) lift laboratory exam requirements for prescription of hormonal contraceptives, and (ii)
authorize distribution of contraceptives in pharmaceutical "depots". In addition, as gnditins of
effectiveness it will adopt a new version of the decree defining MCH services that would include FP as
part of the basic MCH package, and authorize HPNs to distribute all types of contraceptives except IUDs.
3.10         Successful promotion of FP activities at the HP would depend on the credibility of MCH
services being offered in these facilities and their ability to attract potential clients for FP. For this
reason, the program would also strengthen MCH services at the HP level, with particular emphasis on
pre-natal consultation, well-baby care (including growth monitoring and vaccination), and nutritional
rehabilitation. Program activities would include: (a) training for HPNs on MCH service delivery,
maintaining family records for proper monitoring of clients, and time-management skills to better
organize their tasks; (b) provision of material and equipment for MCH-FP services; (c) development of
operational approaches for nutritional surveillance and education, including the following experimental
activities: social marketing of growth charts, introduction of nutritional activities into women's groups'
programs and in activities of social structures (social centers, etc.), and strengthening nutritional activities
of village health workers; and (d) preparation of a national nutrition strategy and program taking into
account results of these experiments.
3.11         Finally, the need for high-cost on-the-job training programs will be eliminated in the long
run by improving MCH-FP instruction in Schools of Public Health. To accomplish this objective, the
program will provide assistance for the development of revised curricula, production of teaching materials
and training of instructors in the National Schools of Public Health.
3.12         For this sub-component, program assistance would include: (i) specialist services for the
preparation of revised curricula (1 month international); (ii) 2 seminars (on the MCH-FP training module
and on the basic training curriculum); (iii) re-equipment for MCH-FP services of HPs in 26 districts
outside the zone of concentration of the district services component; (iv) contraceptives to meet 25% of
national needs in the public sector; (v) the cost of nutrition experiments; and (vi) training of instructors
in the Schools of Public Health. Costs of development of training modules and direct costs of HPN
training would be financed under the district services component (para. 3.37).
3.13         Extending FP Services Through Private Sector Channels. This sub-component will extend
FP services through private sector channels including:
a)    Strengthening and extending FP services in private and parapublic enterprises, in private
clinics and through commercial pharmaceutical outlets; and
b)    Institutional and operational support for the IPPF-affiliated Association Senegalaise pour
le Bien-etre Familial (ASBEF).



- 21 -
3.14         Activities in part (a) build on achievements of the "Private and parapublic sector"
component (VSPP) of the USAID-funded project (PSFP). They will be implemented by the newly-
formed NGO SANFAM (para. 2.3) or by other NGOs with similar objectives. Thirty-four new clinics
in public and private enterprises will be added to the program, and 65 others already in the program will
benefit from follow-up supp'rt. One hundred twenty pharmacists, each accompanied by two assistants
and 200 pharmaceutical "depot" agents, will be trained in FP-IEC.
3.15         Assistance to ASBEF will include: (a) the creation of a FP clinic in Kolda (this would
be its fifth clinic outside Dakar); (b) support for IEC activities; and (c) direct institutional support. For
its IEC activities targeted specifically at youth groups, ASBEF will also have access to funds under the
"youth" component of this project.
3.16         For this sub-component, program assistance would include: (i) training in FP of private
sector doctors, nurses, pharmacists and their assistants, ASBEF staff and volunteers; (ii) contraceptives
(except for contraceptives for the commercial pharmaceutical sector which will be supplied by USAID);
(iii) equipment for MCH/FP services (private enterprises) and FP-IEC (ASBEF); (iv) partial support for
operating costs of SANFAM, ASBEF or other participating NGOs. Participation of NGOs not heretofore
identified will be subject to prior IDA approval.
3.17         Promoting FP through Information. Education and Communication aEC). This sub-
component will:
a)    Develop and implement improved operational approaches for face-to-face communication
through:
i)    an initial evaluation of ongoing field operations in PY1;
ii)    development of improved operational approaches on the basis of evaluation
results
iii)   extension of coverage of face-to-face communication activities through social
development agents of MOI and MCJHSA and volunteer auxiliaries
b)    Develop and implement FP-IEC programs through the mass media
c)    Strengthen institutional capacity at the national level through:
i)    institutional support for the Health Education Unit (HEU) of MOHSA
ii)    a program of "market research" on contraceptive acceptance and use.
3.18         The evaluation of ongoing field operations will focus on agents of the MOI ("mattresses"
and "monitrices") and of the Directorate of Social Affairs (DSA) of MOHSA ("agents sociaux",
"assistants sociaux", etc) who have benefitted from training in FP-IEC under ongoing USAID- and
UNFPA-funded projects. The objective is to assess both impact and efficiency of these activities, with
a view to recommending possible changes in approach. In particular, focus will be given to the
integration of FP-IEC activities with other responsibilities of these agents. A key feature of the
evaluation will be to assess the extent to which the "training and visit" approach used for agricultural
extension agents could be applied to improve the operational efficiency of the "social extension" system.
To this end, the evaluation team will include a T&V specialist (see terms-of-reference in Annex 3-1).
Results of the initial evaluation will be used to reassess ongoing activities, revise training programs and
message contents and, if appropriate, reorganize field services. Training and equipment of social
development agents under this sub-component will thus start in PY2, after completion of the initial
evaluation.



- 22 -
3.19         At the national level, special attention will be given to finding ways to apply commercial
marketing techniques to FP promotion and to building capacity within the HEU in this respect. To this
end, the HEU would receive assistance to set up a twinning arrangement with a firm or institution with
the relevant experience in marketing (e.g., a commercial marketing team) that would help plan strategies
and transfer know-how. The program would also include support to carry out market research studies.
3.20         Program assistance would include: (i) specialist services on evaluation of face-to-face
communication, "training and visit" systems, marketing and design (30 months local, 16 months
international); (ii) training for HEU staff and MOI and DSA field personnel; (iii) a fellowship on social
psychology; (iv) operating costs of the initial evaluation; (v) incremental recurrent costs for HEU;
(vi) production costs of radio and TV programs, press releases and promotional materials; (vii) equipment
for HEU and MOI and DSA field personnel; and (viii) market-research studies. Fifty "monitrices" and
"maftresses" participating in the WID component as well as 750 volunteer auxiliaries belonging to
beneficiary women's groups will have priority in receiving training, equipment and logistical support.
2. Promoting the Status of Women
3.21         This component will support the network of women's groups and their associations (i.e.,
unions of women's groups), key vehicles for improving women's status. It has four sub-components:
a)    Functional literacy training for 6,300 women - members of management committees of
women's groups and women's associations
b)    Extension of the network of "cases-foyer" (centers for local women's group activit As)
in 45 "arrondissements"
c)    Provision of labor-saving equipment for household work
d)    Institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Women
The first three sub-components will be managed and implemented by the Ministry of Interior (MOI),
working through its network of monitors ("monitrices") in the local Centers for Rural Development.
Program activities will cover five regions chosen for the large number of active women's groups: Fatik,
Kaolack, Louga, St. Louis et Ziguinchor. Ten monitors per region will be assigned to participate on a
full-time basis in program activities. Seventy-five groups and nine associations per region will receive
program assistance. Activities of this compotrnt are described in detail in Annex 3-2.
3.22         Functional Literacy for Women. This sub-component will organize functional literacy
courses for over 6,000 members of management committees of women's groups that would benefit from
the "cases-foyer" and the labor-saving equipment installed through the program. Reading materials will
be oriented towards subjects of interest to women: management of labor-saving equipment or of income-
generating activities, health (including nutrition) and family planning. Women will also learn to prepare
simple project proposals for income-generating activities to help them seek financial assistance from
ongoing projects such as the UNDP-funded "Projet economique des femmes" (PEF) and the IDA-funded
Small Rural Operations (SRO) Project. Pedagogical materials developed under the PEF and other similar
projects will serve as basic training documents, with a minimum of revision or development. Literacy
classes will be led by village literacy agents who will be trained and supervised by the program monitors.
These monitors will in turn be trained by literacy experts of the Directorate of Literacy and Basic
Education of the Ministry of Education or of the PEF. Program assistance would include: (i) training



- 23 -
of monitors and of village literacy agents; (ii) development and production of literacy materials; and
(iii) operating costs for functional literacy classes.
3.23         Extension of the network nf "cases-foyer". This sub-component will extend the network
of "cases-foyer" in 45 "arrondissements" to serve as a locale for women's group activities (including FP-
IEC) and to be managed by the local women's association. It builds on a successful pilot experience with
seven cases-foyer organized under the USAID-funded project (PSFP) and the PEF project. One problem
identified under the pilot experience was the poor maintenance of the physical infrastructure. To address
this problem, beneficiary women's associations will be encouraged to organize income-generating
activities from which a part of revenues could be used to cover maintenance costs of the case-foyer; if
necessary, they would apply for funds available through the SRO Project (of which up to US$1.4 million
equivalent has been reserved for women's groups) for the start-up of such projects. Literacy training
for members of management committees for the cases-foyer (para. 3.22) will provide the necessary
assistance in project preparation. Program assistance would include construction and equipment of 45
cases-foyer.
3.24         Labor-saving Equipment for Household Work. This sub-component will provide food
processing equipment and manual water pumps to 375 women's groups. Provision of food processing
equipment would be combined with a group-savings scheme that would familiarize women with the
practice of savings and of making monthly payments, and thus prepare them for eventual contact with
the formal credit system. It builds on successful experience in the PEF and other NGO-supported
projects having similar objectives, as well as similar experiences in neighboring countries.
3.25         Upon receipt of the food processing equipment, each women's group would sign a
contract agreeing to "repay" 50% of the cost of the equipment. Monthly payments would be deposited
into a bank account held in the group's name which would be monitored (but not controlled) by the
Component Support Unit (CSU) in the MOI (para. 4.8), in collaboration with a banking institution.
Upon completion of repayment, the group would be allowed to withdraw the total amount paid for use
in other income earning or social welfare projects. Beneficiary groups would have to meet certain
qualifying criteria to demonstrate their readiness to operate and maintain the equipment, including
organizing a management committee to oversee equipment use, and setting up maintenance and cost
recovery arrangements. Groups receiving manual water pumps would not be required to "repay" any part
of investment cost; they would, however, be subject to the same qualifying criteria, including presenting
a plan for maintenance of the equipment. Support structures to facilitate installation and maintenance of
equipment (including training programs for maintenance personnel, identification of sources of spare
parts, etc) have been put in place under the PEF and similar NGO-funded projects. Project monitors will
guide beneficiary groups in seeking assistance from technical experts of these projects to fulfill qualifying
criteria. Functional literacy training to be provided for members of the management committee
(para. 3.22 above) will include subjects on equipment management and maintenance. Details on the
management and terms of the savings scheme and on qualifying criteria are given in Annex 3-2.
3.26         For this sub-component, program assistance would include: (i) the cost of equipment for
up to 375 women's groups; (ii) training for community millers and repair mechanics; and (iii) an initial
stock of spare parts. To avoid problems experienced in withdrawal of funds from the collaborating
banking institution under the PEF, Government gave assurances during negotiations that, by December
31, 1991, an agreement will be signed between the CSU of the MOI and a banking institutionunder terms
acceptable to IDA.

3.27         Institutional Strengthening of the Women's Ministry. The Ministry in Charge of Women
and Children (MCWC) Is presently preparing a long-term WID strategy with assistance from IDA (under
proposed SPPF financing and Bank sector work) and other donors. To contribute to that exercise as well
as to assist in the continued development of practical operational approaches to promote WID, MCWC
will monitor and evaluate the effectiveness and impact of activities carried out under this project as well
as the overall success of all programs aimed at improving women's status and their access to improved
economic opportunities. In addition, it will review curriculum content of basic training programs for
monitors in order to adapt them to the new roles played by these agents under the proposed WID
strategy. Finally, it will participate actively in the mid-term review of the proposed project, focusing on
the sustainability of the approaches used to promote and support women and their associations. To
generate greater awareness about women's roles and problems, the MCWC will also carry out
informational and promotional activities through the mass media and through a series of seminars.
Assistance to MCWC for strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation activities as well as for its
informational activities would be provided under the program. It would include: (i) specialist services
for monitoring and evaluation and for information-awareness campaigns (11.5 months international); (ii)
training for MCWC staff; (iii) seminars at the national and regional levels; (iv) production and
dissemination of mass media materials; (v) incremental recurrent cost support; and (vi) office equipment
and furniture for MCWC.
3. Reaching Young Men and Women
3.28         This component will support FP-IEC activities for youth through:
a)    IEC programs on Family Life Education (FLE) and related topics of interest to youth
including family planning, population issues, family welfare, STD, AIDS, etc.; and
b)    rehabilitation of youth centers (centers for youth association activities).
It complements assistance of the proposed UNFPA-funded FLE Project which covers both IEC and
community-oriented activities of youth associations. For IEC activities, the Ministry of Youth and Sports
(MYS) will call on the services of the Health Education Unit of MOHSA which will develop youth-
oriented programs and will provide the services of trainers, training material, and IEC materials targeted
to youth. MYS will be responsible for seeking ways to best integrate FP-IEC activities with other youth
association activities. Rehabilitation of youth centers will take place in the context of a broader program
to train youth in artisanal skills (carpentry, masonry, etc.) organized under the UNFPA-funded project.
Under that project, these skills would be applied as well to other community-oriented activities such as
sanitation, reforestation, etc. Program activities will cover the peri-urban areas in the regions of Dakar,
Thies, Kaolack, and St. Louis.
3.29         Program assistance would include: (i) rehabilitation and equipment of 12 departmental
youth centers (Centres departementaux d'Education populaire et sportive - CDEPS) and 26 training
centers ("Foyers de jeunes"); (ii) specialist services on FLE and related topics; (iii) training of MYS
agents on FLE; (iv) vehicles for 4 regional offices; and (v) production of mass media materials.
Activities of this component are described in detail in Annex 3-3.

4. Institutional Strengthening for Promoting the National Population Program
3.30         This component will strengthen institutional capacity to create and maintain a policy
environment conducive to the attainment of the objectives of the national population program. It has two
sub-components:
a)    Population-related research and dissemination of information on population-related issues
to natioial and local leaders;
b)    Monitoring and evaluation of implementation of the Population Action and Investment
Program (PAIP).
These activities will be led by the Division of Human Resources in the Ministry of Economy, Finance
and Planning in its capacity as lead agency for the population program and secretariat to the National
Population Council (CONAPOP). Program assistance complements ongoing assistance from UNFPA to
the Population Unit in this Division and the Communication Unit (UNICOM) in the Ministry of
Communication and Culture.
3.31         Population Research and Information Dissemination. This sub-component will provide
assistance for continued research on key determinants of population growth in Senegal (women's
economic and social roles, girls' education, infant mortality, urbanization, and legal and regulatory
constraints), channel information on research results to appropriate sector planners and policy-makers,
and assist these leaders in adjusting sectoral or regional plans to be more responsive to population
objectives. Research on legal and regulatory constraints will focus on priority topics identified through
an earlier study including- the legal age at marriage, laws on matrimonial status (choice between
polygamy and monogamy), family allowances and other family-support measures, and the application of
laws affecting women's status in society. Dissemination seminars on legal constraints would address
those responsible for making or applying laws audges, politicians, religious leaders, law enforcement
authorities) as well as groups most affected by these issues (women, youth, social workers, health
personnel). An Advisory Committee on Population Research consisting of academics and operational
personnel will be created to review research proposals from individual researchers or research institutions,
preferably Senegalese or from the Sahel region. Proposals should identify policy-makers or sector
planners who will use research results and include a program for their dissemination (seminars,
workshops, etc.) and application. To ensure coherence and avoid duplication, it is recommended that the
Advisory Committee on Research screen all population research activities managed by the Human
Resources Division (HRD), regardless of source of funding. The HRD will seek agreement from other
major donors in this respect and will invite them to participate in the selection of committee members.
Annual research and dissemination programs will be discussed with IDA during the annual project
implementation reviews (para. 4.11).
3.32         Program assistance would include: (i) specialist services to carry out research studies (50
months local); (ii) 10 dissemination seminars; and (iii) translation and printing of research results.
3.33         Monitoring and evaluation of the National Population Program. The Human Resources
Division (HRD) will develop and maintain a system to monitor progress in the implementation of the
national population program. In collaboration with lead agencies for each of the eleven components of
the PAIP, it has prepared a list of key measurable indicators, principal sources of data and the agencies
responsible for collecting them (see Annex 3-1 l. By project start-up, HRD will have developed and



- 26 -
installed (under PPF financing) a central monitoring system including the supporting data-
collection/updating systems organized in collaboration with concerned agencies. This matrix of key
indicators will be presented to IDA for review each year during the annual project implementation review.
To evaluate the overall impact of the population program over time, a second Demographic and Health
Survey will be conducted in late 1991 and a third one in 1996. (The first DHS was conducted in 1986.)
This survey would provide information on fertility, contraceptive prevaicnce; knowledge and attitudes
on family planning, and infant and child mortality. Special evaluation studies on specific elements of the
population program will also be carried out during the period between the two household surveys.
3.34         To support these activities, program assistance would include: (i) specialist services for
developing the monitoring system (2 months local, 2 months international); (ii) equipment and recurrent
costs for computerization; and (iii) costs of special evaluation studies and partial costs for two DHS
surveys (the DHS Project and USAID would fund the remaining costs, at least for 1991).
C. Part II: Implementing the National Health Policy
1. Developing the District Health System
3.35         This component would assist Government to put in place the new district health system
that will serve as the basic operational unit for health care delivery (para. 2.40-2.41 above and Annex
- 4). This would involve the application of new norms of coverage, staffing, and resource allocation and
the establishment of new managerial systems in the 45 health districts in the country. To achieve this
objective, this component would include four sub-components:
a)    development of training programs for health district personnel
b)    development of a financial management system for districts
c)    promotion of community health organizations
d)    assistance for implementation of District Health Development Plans (DHDP) in 19
districts in the regions of Dakar, Thies and Diourbel
The first three sub-components would cover all 45 districts in the country. The last one, which largely
involves construction and equipment activities, would cover all districts in the three selected regions.
3.36         To set the stage for implementation of the above project activities, Government has issued
instructions (a) defining the structure and norms of coverage, function, staffing, management and
supervision of the district system, and (b) delineating the 45 health districts in the country. In addition,
to ensure appropriate allocation of personnel resources to the district system, the completion of
implementation of the redeployment and recruitment measures defined in the emergency plan for FY90-91
(para. 2.44) is a condition of credit effectiveness; and Government gave assurances during negotiations
that it vould, through 1996, implement the redeployment and recruitment measures defined in the
medium-term plan for FY91-96 (para. 2.45).
3.37         Development of Trainine Programs for District Health Personnel. This sub-component
will support the development of a package of training programs for District Medical Officers (DMO) and
Health Post Nurses (HPN) to prepare them for their new responsibilities, both managerial and technical,
and assist them in preparing a districL plan to guide the implementation of reforms in their district. The
second district doctor (DM02), who will share supervision and training responsibilities with the DMO,



- 27 -
will participate in the relevant training program. He will also receive training in emergency surgery.
Regional Medical Officers (RMO), who are responsible for overseeing health district development within
their regions, will participate in all programs addressed to DMOs. Programs to be developed include:
For DMOs:
a)    Preparation of a District Health Development Plan (DHDP) and set-up of district
operations
b)    Management of drugs, community health organizations, and financial management of
health districts and health posts
For DMOs and DMO2s:
c)    Management of district operations, and supervision and training of HPNs
For DMO2s:
d)    Emergency surgery; each DMO2 will be accompanied by one health center nurse who
will be trained in anesthesia techniques
For HPNs:
e)    Management of a health post, including the minimum  package of survices and
administrative activities
Approaches, objectives, organization and implementation calendars for each of the above programs are
detailed in Annex 3-5. Given the large number of HPNs in the country (over 600 at present, over 900
in principle by 1995) and the importance of practical aspects of their training, nurses' training will be
carried out in two phases: an initial two-week seminar followed by a series of supervision-training visits
by the doctor over a six-month period. The supervision visit is thus an essential element of the proposed
training program. Around 720 HPNs will be trained during the five-year program implementation period.
3.38         Training in emergency surgery will be joindy organized with the Belgian and French TA
programs, which are providing surgeons at three facilities to be used as training centers: the health center
at Guediaweye, regional hospitals in St. Louis and Ziguinchor. A total of 24 DMO2s and 24 nurse-
anesthetists will be trained during the program period. Priority will be given to DMO2s and nurses in
the program's zone of concentration and in the nine health centers that were constructed or rehabilitated
under the IDA-funded Rural Health Project.
3.39         In addition to the above training activities, two districts will be set up as Training Zones
where "best practice" in district management and service delivery will be established in a "real-world"
environment. Except for an initial intensive investment in technical assistance and training, and regular
supervision visits from technical assistance teams, the two districts will function on budgets and
allocations of human and other resources no different from other districts. The Training Zones would
serve as a place for practical training of DMOs where they would return for refresher training after an
initial period of managing operations in their own districts. Thirty PMOs will be trained here during the
program period, with priority given to DMOs in the three regions of concentration (para. 3.45). The
practical training course will also serve in the long run as an orientation course for new doctors taking
up posts as DMOs for the first time. Two districts have been selected (one urban - Nabil Choucair
(Dakar) - and one rural - Tambacounda) as training zones.
3.40         Program assistance would include: (i) specialist services (65 months local, 7 months
international) to set up and supervise the Training Zone; (ii) development of training materials and
operational guidelines; (iii) participation by DMOs, DM02s, and HPNs in training seminars; (iv) 20



-28 -
vehicles for supervision and on-the-job training; (v) minor rehabilitation and equipment of health centers
in the Training Zones; (vi) recurrent costs of training and research activities in Training Zones; and (vii)
annual meetings of all DMOs at the national level. Operating costs directly related to service delivery
in the Training Zones will be financed through the districts' normal operating budgets.
3.41         Developing a Financial Management System for Districts. This sub-component aims to
develop budgeting and financial management procedures for health districts in preparation for establishing
financial autonomy by 1992. Activities will include: (a) development of mechanisms to facilitate actual
expenditures by districts of their budget allocations, including a review of procedures for preparation and
execution of district budgets; (b) a review of criteria applied in allocating budgets to different health
facilities; and (c) establishment of a standardized, simplified accounting system at the district level.
During negotiations, Govermment gave assuranges that it would present MOHSA's budget in a format that
would clearly delineate drug and material allocations for the 45 districts in the country throughout the
project period. Finally, to ensure sufficient budget allocations to health in general and to the health
district system in particular, Government gave assurances that:  (a) the percentage share of the
government's recurrent budget allocations to MOHSA for the health sector would increase to 5.25%
during FY 91-92, to 5.75% during FY93, to 6.25% during FY94, to 6.75% during FY95, and to 7.25%
during FY96; (b) total drug and material allocations to the 42 districts would be at least 1.5 billion CFAF
in FY91-92, 1.1 billion CFAF in FY93 and, subsequently through FY96, this amount would increase by
at least 10% every year in real terms2; and (c) it will furnish to IDA, by October 30 of each year, (i)
the draft recurrent budget for health for the upcoming fiscal year, and (ii) the draft investment budget for
the health sector for the coming three years.
3.42         Program assistance would include: (i) specialist services on budgetary and accounting
procedures for the public sector (I month local, 4 months international); and (ii) training of 45 district
administrators on the accounting system.
3.43         Promoting Community Health Organizations. CHOs will play an essential role in
mobilizing local resources for district operations, particularly at the health post level. Public health
personnel, local officials, and the general public need to be made fully aware of this fact and to
understand the terms of the partnership between Government and the community. Training for DMOs
and HPNs on district operations (para. 3.37) will include orientation on the role of CHOs and skills on
how to support CHO development. To further promote CHO development, this sub-component will
provide support for:
a)    public information campaigns on CHOs and how they should function
b)    dissemination of guidelines for members and officers of health committees and
associations
c)    a study on the effectiven; ss of the cost recovery system in PY3.
To strengthen the regulatory framework within which CHOs would function, in particular to reduce
misallocation and improve management of funds, Government will issue regulations governing the
2 Smegal's Fisd Year will change from July I-June 30, to January l-Dcember 30, tarting in 1992. Its 1991-92
budget thus rpiaen  an 18wmonth budget.

organization and management of CHOs, defining procedures for the transformation of existing CHOs to
conform with new regulations, and requiring that only CHOs in conformity with new regulations will be
permitted to operate in public health facilities. These regulations were discussed and finalized during
negotiations; their adoption is a condition of credit effectiveness.
3.44         Under this sub-component, program assistance would include: (i) specialist services for
development of information campaigns and guidelines, and evaluation of cost recovery efforts (4 months
local, 4.5 months international); (ii) seminars for local leaders (mayors, "prdfets'); (iii) production of
radio and television spots and posters in 6 local languages; and (iv) printing of guidelines. This
component is discussed in detail in Annex 3-10.
3.45         Assistance for Implementing District Development Plans in Three Regions. This sub-
component will provide assistance to 19 health districts in the regions of Dakar, Thies, and Diourbel to
implement the.ir district health development plans (DHDP). Assistance will include:
a)    Establishment of the network of district health facilities through (i) construction,
equipment of 90 new HPs; (ii) transformation of 12 MCH centers into HPs; (iii) re-
equipment of around 190 existing and transformed HPs; (iv) rehabilitation, re-equipment
of 5 existing HCs and 7 district pharmacies
b)    Logistical support for supervision and management systems at the district level
c)    Strengthening management and support capacity at the regional level
Districts will also receive an initial stock of essential drugs under the essential drugs component
(para. 3.54). Each participating district must have adopted a district development plan, with IDA
approval, to qualify for assistance. All facilities receiving assistance (including new construction) must
be included in the approved district coverage plan. In addition, no civil works on HPs will be started
unless a local health committee has been organized in accordance with new regulations (para. 3.43). For
the supervision of construction of new HPs, MOHSA will employ consultants, although MOHSA may
want to use AGETIP (Agence d'execution des travaux d'inter8t public contre le sous-emploi) as executing
agency since all the new HPs will be in urban areas.
3.46         Each district will receive equipment and furniture worth up to 5 million CFAF to partially
re-equip and refurnish existing and transformed HPs. The DMO will determine priority needs for HPs
in the district selected from a standard equipment and furniture list for HPs and will present a request to
the Component Support Unit (CSU) in MOHSA, which will procure the equipment for all districts.
3.47         At the regional level, the Regional Medical Officer (RMO) will oversee the district level
reform program and provide the needed technical and administrative support for its implementation. He
will be particularly involved in the preparation and monitoring of DHDPs and in planning and
implementing personnel redeployment between districts. RMOs in the three regions of concentration will
receive the necessary training and logistical support to carry out their leadership responsibilities.
3.48         Program assistance would include: (i) construction/rehabilitation and equipment of HPs,
HCs and district pharmacies; (ii) information system registers and instruction manuals for HPs, HCs and
district management teams; (iii) fellowships for master's degrees in public health with an emphasis on
the management of health district operations for two of the three RMOs, and study tours for all 3 RMOs



- 30 -
to observe successful projects in other countries; (iv) minor rehabilitation of 3 regional health offices, and
provision of material and equipment; and (v) establishment of regiontal document centers.
2. Promoting Essential Drugs
3.49         This component will support MOHSA's strategy to promote wider use and availability
of essential drugs and to significantly reduce their cost, focusing on strengthening demand and supply
elements in the public distribution system, as called for in its medium-term plan for the pharmaceutical
sector (para. 2.42). It includes four sub-components:
a)    reform of the National Pharmacy
b)    supply of an initial stock of drugs for health districts
c)    information campaign. for prescribers and the public
d)    development of a long-term strategy for the pharmaceutical sector
Certain activities to be undertaken under the district services component, including training of health
personnel on the use and management of drugs (para. 3.37), measures to ensure sufficient budgetary
allocations for drugs at the district level (para. 3.41), and support for CHO resource mobilization efforts
(para. 3.43), also constitute key elements of the essential drugs program.
3.50         Reform of the National Pharmacy. This sub-component will support actions necessary
to enable the National Pharmacy (PNA) to perform its function as the principal supplier of low-cost
essential drugs to the public health system. It will include:
a)    adoption of restructuring measures to grant PNA the financial flexibility to fulfill its
commercial functions while retaining its status as a government entity
b)    support for the establishment of improved managerial, financial, procurement and
distribution systems.
3.51          As part of its restructuring program, PNA iLas been granted a three-year exemption from
standard Government procurement procedures which are slow and unsuited to the nature of the
pharmaceutical market. In addition, to ensure prompt release of budget allocations for drug expenditures,
funds from budget drug allocations will be channelled on a regular basis into a commercial bank account
to be held at the level of PNA. To access these funds, each district would submit to PNA every four
months a list of drug purchases worth up to one-third of its annual budgetary allocation. PNA will cede
the equivalent amount in drugs, in addition to any other drugs to be purchased on a cash basis using
district revenues from CHO contributions or other sources. PNA will monitor drug transfers and budget
allocation expenditures separately for each district, as it will for each of its other clients. An initial
deposit of 350 million CFAF will be made into the commercialibank account to be held by PNA as a
condition of credit effectiveness. During negotiations, Government gave assurances that it will replenish
this account every three months.
3.52         PNA will undertake major organizational reforms to improve its internal efficiency
including: staff reinforcement and clearer task definition, restriction of its product range to items in the
official list of essential drugs; improved managerial, financial and procurement systems (including
maximum use of ICB procedures and placing multi-year drug orders); and adjustment of its pricing policy
tc cover internal operating costs (to be set initially at a margin of 5% over acquisition cost). The



- 31 -
proposed internal reorganization of PNA is described in detail in Annex 3-9. During negotiations,
Government gave assurances that PNA stocks will be maintained in conformity with the official list of
essential drugs throughout the project period (starting in PY2) and revise the list of essential drugs only
after prior agreement with IDA.
3.53         Program assistance would include: (i) specialist services on PNA organization and
management (11 months international); (ii) training on drug management and distribution for PNA
personnel (210 days local, 10 months external); (iii) minor civil works, equipment and furniture;
(iv) salaries of 2 pharmacists and a "contrBleur de gestion" on a declining basis (100% in PYI-3, 50%
in PY4-6); and (v) other recurrent costs for PY1-3.
3.54         Provision of an Initial Stock of Drugs for Health Districts. To stimulate district
operations and to revive cost recovery efforts, this sub-component would "prime the pump" of the drug
supply system by providing an initial stock of drugs at the PNA, the HC and the HP levels. Program
assistance would include: (i) 200 million CFAF worth of drugs for PNA to complement its existing stock
(400 million CFAF value) and thus complete an initial revolving stock of 4 months' drug needs for
district level facilities; (ii) 4 months' supply of drugs for all district HCs; and (iii) 4 months' supply of
drugs for 16 HPs in every district in the country (a total of 720 HPs). Supplies to PNA and to all HCs
will be provided in PYl. Supplies for each HP will be provided upon completion of the HPN's training
under the district services component and would thus be phased in over PY2-6. Because the level of
referrals to the HC is expected to be at less than full capacity at the start of the program, drug needs are
estimated for this purpose at 70% of capacity.
3.55         To ensure that the initial stock will be renewed through efficient management and cost
recovery, each district must fulfill the following criteria to qualify for assistance under this sub-
component: (a) adoption of district health plans consistent with nationally adopted norms; (b) completion
of training in drug management for the DMO; (c) organization of the district pharmacy according to
guidelines, and (d) setting of fees for the health center and agreement to apply them immediately upon
receipt of project-supplied drugs. Each HP receiving assistance must fulfill the following criteria:
(a) completion by the HPN of the initial two-week seminar on HP management; (b) (re)organization of
the local health committee according to new regulations; and (c) setting of fees for the health post and
agreement to apply them immediately upon receipt of project supplied drugs. All facilities receiving
assistance must be included in the approved district coverage plan of the DHDP. The DMO will certify
to the fulfillment of the above criteria for the district as a whole and for each HP receiving assistance.
The CSU will verify ex post, through random checks, the validity of these certifications. During
negotiations, Government gave assurancA that it will allocate the initial stocks of drugs provided under
the project only to those Health Centers and Health Posts that meet the above-mentioned eligibility
criteria.
3.56         Informnation Campaigns on Essential Drugs.  This sub-component will support the
promotion of essential drugs through a public information campaign aimed at the general public, members
and officers of community health organizations, and public and private health practitioners and
pharmacists. Two types of activities are planned, in addition to the training programs for district health
personnel to be carried out under the district services component: (a) information campaigns for the
general public; and (b) dissemination of essential drugs lists (including price information) and prescription
guidelines to health personnel in the public and private sectors. The project would finance: (i) services
of a specialist in social marketing (1.5 months international); (ii) production of television and radio spots



- 32 -
and of posters in six local languages; (iii) reprinting of the essential drugs list and prescription guidelines
ior distribution to private health practitioners and pharmacists, NGOs and medical insurance plans of
large enterprises (1PM).
3.57         Development of a Long-term Strategy for the Pharmaceutical Sector. This sub-component
would provide assistance for the development of a long-term pharmaceutical sector strategy whose
objective would be the development of a strong, open market for low-cost essential drugs involving both
public and private sectors (para. 2.42). Two special studies will be carried out under management of the
CSU in PY3 as inputs to the preparation of the strategy: (a) analysis of the long-term flnancial viability
of PNA; and (b) alternative market structures for the supply of essential drugs, with focus on the role
of PNA and of the private sector. These studies will take into consideration experience during the first
two years of project implementation, particularly as concerns operational efficiency of PNA and any
improvements in the cost and availability of essential drugs. Among other things, the option of
transforming PNA into an autonomous public entity will be considered in the light of study findings.
Representatives of the commercial drug sector as well as concerned NGOs will participate to the extent
possible in preparation of the strategy. Program assistance would include: (i) 8.5 months of specialist
services (internationally recruited) to carry out the two studies and prepare the strategy; and (ii) a national
seminar to discuss the proposed strategy.
3.    Institutional Strengthening in the Health Sector
3.58         This component continues support initiated under the Rural Health Project (Cr. 13i0-SE)
for institutional development at the national level. It focuses on: (a) manpower planning and
development; (b) budgeting and financial planning; (c) physical asset management; and (d) institutional
support for the Directorate of General Administration and Equipment (DGAE) in MOHSA.
3.59         For manpower development, MOHSA would: (a) carry out studies to define staffing
norms for regional hospitals and specialized structures of the ministry (Public Hygiene, specialized health
centers, etc); (b) continue development and maintenance of a computerized personnel information system
to monitor progress in redeployment and recruitment; and (c) prepare a program for the restructuring of
the education and training system in the health sector. The restructuring program could be financed under
the proposed second Human Resources Development Project on education and training (FY92S). During
negotiations, Government gave assurances that it will complete the studies on staffing norms for regional
hospitals and specialized studies of MOHSA, and discuss the findings of the studies and recommendations
with IDA by June 1993.
3.60         For management and planning, MOHSA would: (a) in complement to work to be carried
out for the district level (para. 3.41), review existing procedures for budget preparation and execution
for the ministry as a whole, and recommend measures for improvement; (b) develop and introduce
mechanisms to monitor the flow of financial resources from the budget, community health organizations,
local governments and donors and their use; (c) complete the inventory of existing assets (infrastructure
and equipment), assess their condition, and introduce an asset management system (including methods
for programming new purchases and maintenance and for maintaining up to date records of facilities);
and (d) review the functions and activities of the four divisions of DGAE, recommend an appropriate
organization and suitable management syst-ms, and assist in the implementation of recommendations.



- 33 -
3.61         Program assistance would include: (a) specialist services to carry out six studies (31
months local, 13 months international); (b) seminars and workshops on various management systems; (c)
local training of staff on computer utilization (10 months); and (d) 1 vehicle, office equipment, and their
operating and maintenance costs for DGAE.
D. Project Costs and Financing Plan
3.62         The total program costs over the five-years of implementation is estimated at US$52.8
million equivalent (net of taxes and duties). No decision has been made on the financing plan for the
complete program but a number of bilateral and multilateral donors have expressed interest in
cofinancing. They include France, Belgium, Canada, UNICEF, UNFPA. Program costs net of taxes
are shown in Annex 3-12, pages 1 to 5.
3.63         Given the urgent need to renew efforts in the population and health sectors and to
capitalize on the current momentum of reform, and because anticipated cofinancing may not be
completely available for several more months, the available funds (IDA, US$35.0 million; Government,
US$2.9 million) would be used to support a project consisting of all activities planned for the first three
years of the five-year program. In the event that cofinancing is obtained for certain components or
activities in the project, it would be possible to reallocate IDA funds thus freed to other activities in the
program, which has already been appraised in its entirety by IDA.
3.64         The reduced project would cover the same range of activities described in the preceding
section, with the following changes in physical targets:

- 34 -
3.65         7ne total cost of the project, net of taxes, is estimated at US$37.9 million equivalent with
a foreign exchange component of US$26.4 million (70%). Base cost estimates are US$31.3 million at
February 1991 prices. Costs exclude direct taxes and import duties which, although not waived, would
be paid by government. Physical and price contingencies are estimated at US$6.6 million (17.4% of total
cost) with physical contingencies representing 8% of base cost. Price contingencies assume: (a) a
domestic inflation rate of 5% during the life of the project; and (b) foreign inflation rates of 9.0% for
PYl, 1.1 % for PY2, .4% for PY3 and 1.6% for PY4. The project would be financed by IDA (US$35
million or 93% of total cost), and budgetary allocations from the government (US$2.9 million or 7% of
total cost). More detailed project cost estimates and terms of financing are given in Annex 3-12, pages
6to 11.
3.66         Recurrent cost implications. Program invesmn  would generate net incremental
operating costs estimated at about US$8.0 million over the five-year implementation period, of which
US$4.2 million would be absorbed by Government, with the balance to be absorbed by health system
users. Expressed as a percentage of the FY90-91 health budget, incremental Government cost would be
0.7% in PYI and 2.3% in each subsequent project year. Salaries of 25 district doctors account for 25%
of these costs, drugs 57% and other costs 18%. A large part of contraceptive costs are included under
the "drugs" category above, except for those to be distributed through the private sector which would be
financed through donors' contributions or direct purchase by users. Non-health components of the
program are not expected to generate significant recurrent costs. Restructuring measures taken under the
ptrogram would generate significant cost savings which are, however, difficult to quantify. These would
include savings on the cost of drugs (average cost per episode would decrease by 50-75%), scale
economies derived from integrating vertical programs into the standard service package for health posts
and health centers, and savings on hospital costs of primary cases pre-screened at the post and center
levels.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Status of Project Preparation and Readiness
4.1          Following adoption of the National Population Policy in April 1988, project preparation
started under coordination of the former Directorate of Human Resources in the Ministry of Planning
(currently the Division of Human Resources in the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Planning). The
population component was prepared by staff from the former Ministries of Planning and of Social
Development and from the Ministries of Youth and of Health, and the health component by staff of the
Ministry of Health.  Preparation was complicated by one major and two minor Government
reorganizations that occurred over the last eighteen months, all of which affected key ministries involved
in project preparation and/or implementation. Notwithstanding the resulting transitional problems,
preparation has continued on track owing primarily to Government's strong commitment to promoting
human resources development.
4.2          During preparation, much attention was given to building consensus on newly-adopted
policy orientations, both within Government and within the donor community, and on developing
common approaches to operationalizing these new policies. Measures touching on specific elements of
the larger policy package (contraceptive use and distribution, essential drugs, decentralization, norms for
the district health system, etc.), are in advanced stages of preparation. Implementation plans have also



- 35 -
been clearly defined. Draft terms of reference for the preparation of the training activities scheduled for
PY1 as well as for the initial evaluation of ongoing FP-IEC activities also scheduled for PY1, have been
prepared by Government. Furniture and equipment lists have been finalized. Preparation of training
programs and of construction standards for "cases-foyer" and for health posts have been initiated under
PPF funding and under the ongoing Rural Health Project. Under the PPF (No. P572-0-SE), an amount
of US$600,000 was approved by IDA on June 12, 1989. Senegal benefitted also of an SPPF of
US$180,000, approved on November 25, 1987, for the preparation of the national population policy.
B. Project Coordination and Management
4.3          Because of the complexity of the project, comprising seven components involving six
different ministries, high-level coordination will be provided by an Interministerial Committee. The
Interministerial Committee is chaired by the Minister of Economy, Finance and Planning, and includes
the Ministers of Interior, Health, Education, Women's condition, and Youth and Sports. The Committee
will provide overall guidance and supervision for project implementation. It will be responsible for
policy decisions, especially of an interministerial nature, and for the resolution of any major
implementation problems that may arise. The Committee will approve annual work programs and
budgets for each component, review progress reports and evaluate results, and initiate any corrective
actions that may be necessary, including modifications to policies, programs and budgets already
approved.
4.4          While implementation responsibility for project components rests with the respective
ministries, a Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) in the MEFP will be responsible for overall project
coordination and administrative and financial matters, as well as monitoring and evaluation. Specifically,
the PCU will:
serve as a secretariat to the Interministerial Committee;
*   consolidate annual work programs and budgets prepared by the ministries responsible for project
components;
-   procure goods and services (preparing bidding documents based on executing ministries' requests,
calling for bids, organizing bid evaluation, etc.) for its own needs and for the women, youth and
population sector institutional strengthening components;
-   handle disbursements (preparing the documentation necessary for withdrawal applications) and
manage the Special Account established for the requirements of the PCU and the women, youth
and population sector institutional strengdtening components;
-   maintain the project accounts and make arrangements for Audit;
-   consolidate progress reports for all project components for submission to the Interministerial
Committee and to donors;
-   supervise and coordinate monitoring and evaluation activities for all project components; and
-   liaise with donors on all project matters.
4.5          The PCU will be headed by a Project Manager with a good knowledge of administrative
procedures and experience in management and will also include a deputy project manager, preferably an
economist/planner, responsible inter alia for monitoring and evaluation, an accountant, an administrative
and financial assistant, and support staff. The PCU will employ short-term experts, particularly to assist
in project monitoring and evaluation.



- 36 -
4.6          Since the bulk of the project will be implemented by various divisions in the Ministry of
Health (MOHSA), the Ministry will maintain a Component Support Unit (CSU) for Health that will be
autonomous and will provide logistical support to the executing divisions and handle procurement and
disbursement (including a separate Special Account) for all the requirements of the Ministry. The CSU
for Health will consist of:
-   a Director, with experience in management and in public health;
-   a Deputy Director, preferably a health planner/economist;
-   a civil e.-gineer; and
-   three accountants, and support staff.
4.7          For the various MOHSA  components and sub-components, management and
implementation responsibilities will be as follows:
-   the National Family Planning Program component will be implemented by the MCH-FP division
of MOHSA and NGOs for the sub-component aimed at expanding FP and MCH services and by
the Health Education Unit of MOHSA in collaboration with the MCH-FP division and the Social
Affairs Directorate of MOHSA, the MOI and the Ministry of Culture and Communication
(MOCC) for the IEC sub-component;
-   the District Health Services component will be implemented by the Directorate of Public Health
in collaboration with the Directorate of General Administration and Equipment and the HEU of
MOHSA, Dakar University or other sources of training expertise, and the Ministry of Interior;
-   the essential drugs component will be implemented by the Ministry of Economy, Finance and
Plan (MEFP), the National Pharmacy, and the CSU, the Directorate of Public Health and the
Health Education Unit of MOHSA;
-   the Component for institutional strengthening in the health sector will be implemented by the
Directorate of General Administration and Equipment and the Training and Research Bureau of
MOHSA in collaboration with the Directorate of Public Health.
4.8          The component for promoting the Status of Women will be managed and implemented
by the Ministry of Interior (MOI) in collaboration with the Ministry in charge of the condition of women
and children (MCWC). At the central level, a CSU for Women in the Executive Secretariat of the
Centers for Rural Development of the MOI will be responsible for overall component coordination. The
CSU for Women will consist of a Director, a Deputy Director, three specialists in functional literacy, FP-
IEC and community development, an administrative assistant, an accountant and support staff. The
component will be implemented in the field by staff of the Centers for Rural Development in
collaboration with the Health Education Unit of MOHSA and the Directorate of Literacy and Basic
Education of MOE. The MCWC, which will also have a Component Support Unit (CSU) responsible
for monitoring and evaluation, will be closely associated with the component implementation.
4.9          The component for reaching young men and women will be managed and implemented
by the Ministry for Youth and Sports (MYS)/Directorate of Youth and Socio-educational activities, in
collaboration with the MOHSA/Health Education Unit. The CSU for Youth, to be established in MYS
for the UNFPA-funded project, with the participation of the International Labor Organization (ILO), will
also be responsible for overall coordination of this component.



- 37 -
4.10         The staffing of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and of the Component Support Units
(CSUs) in MOHSA, MOI, MCWC and MYS with personnel whose qualifications and experience are
satisfactory to IDA would be a condition of effectiveness. During negotiations, Government gave
assurances that the PCU positions and those of the CSUs in MOHSA, MOI, MCWC, and MYS will be
filled at all times with personnel whose qualifications and experience are satisfactory to IDA.
C. Project Monitoring and Evaluation
4.11         Monitoring and Evaluation will be carried out during the life of the project by the
implementing ministries and agencies as well as by the CSUs and the PCU. Each implementing unit
would monitor its own activities and submit semi-annual progress reports to the component's CSU, who
would in turn report to the PCU. The PCU would therefore have an overall view of problems and issues
in project implementation and would be in a position to recommend to the Interministerial Committee any
corrective actions that may be required. Joint IDA/Government reviews of project implementation would
be carried out on an annual basis. Such reviews are designed to examine the progress of implementation
to date, discuss the results of the previous year's work program and agree on the following year's work
program and budget. Donors supporting the project would be invited to participate in the annual reviews.
During negotiations, Government gave assurances that, by October 31 of each year, it would organize
a review meeting to be attended by staff of the PCU and CSUs and representatives of IDA in order to
review (i) the draft annual work program and budget for project activities to be undertaken during the
next fiscal year, (ii) the draft recurrent budget for health for the next fiscal year (para. 3.41), and (iii)
a draft investment budget for the health sector for the coming three years (para. 3.41). The final versions
of the project annual work program and budget, and investment budget for health would reflect the
comments made by IDA.
4.12         After three full years of implementation, the Government, IDA and cofinanciers would
undertake a more comprehensive and detailed evaluation of the progress of project implementation,
including assessments of whether the strategies being followed are producing expected results and whether
those strategies need to be modified in light of changing circumstances. During negotiations, Government
gave assuranc  that it will undertake, by June 30, 1994 at the very latest, a comprehensive evaluation
of the project.
D. Specialist Services
4.13         The program includes a total of 389 person-months of specialist services (of which 67%
to be locally recruited). Program costs also include about CFAF 480 million (about US$1.84 million
equivalent) for technical fees comprising architectural services and engineering services for studies and
supervision of construction. Details on specialist services are given in Annex 4-1.
E. Procurement

NOTE: Figures in parentheses are the respective amounts financed by the IDA credit.
4.15           Contracts for goods, including vehicles, equipment, materials and drugs totalling US$8.8
million equivalent, representing about 70% of the total value of contracts for goods financed by IDA,
would be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (May 1985) and would be grouped, to
the extent practicable, into bid packages of at least US$100,000 each. Where ICB procedures are used,
a preferential margin of 15%, or the applicable customs duty, whichever is less, over the c.i.f. prices of
competing goods would be given to domestic manufacturers In accordance with IDA's guidelines. To
help ensure the quality of drugs purchased under the project, which will be specified in the bidding
documents under the international non-propriety name, prequalification of manufacturers/suppliers would
be required; details on prequalification and other aspects of the drug procurement procedures are given
in Appendix B of Annex 3-9. Civil works estimated to cost more than US$1,000,000 equivalent each,
totalling US$10.3 million equivalent, and representing 79% of the total value of civil works contracts
financed by IDA, would also be suitable for procurement through ICB.



- 39 -
4.16         The remaining 30% of the total value of goods and the rerm8aining 21% of the total value
of civil works financed by IDA would be suitable for procurement other than ICB. The exceptions to
ICB procurement would be for (a) contracts for goods (other than drugs) estimated to cost less than
US$100,000 equivalent each, which in the aggregate would not exceed US$3.1 million, and (b) small-size
civil works contracts for rehabilitation/improvement, which, in the aggregate, not exceed US$2.7 million.
These items, which are not expected to attract foreign bidders because of their small size, would be
awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertized locally (LCB) in accordance with procedures
acceptable to IDA which would include: advertising in local papers, public bid opening, clarity of
evaluation criteria, and award to the lowest evaluated bidder; foreign bidders would not be precluded
from participating. Another exception to ICB would be for contracts for drugs required in health
emergencies duly declared by competent authorities estimated to cost less than US$60,000 each, which,
in the aggregate, could not exceed US$0.5 million; those contracts could be awarded on the basis of
comparison of price quotations, solicited from a list of at least three local or international suppliers
eligible under the guidelines, in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Association.
4.17         Incremental operating costs (including spare parts, office supplies, repairs and
consumables) which cannot be grouped into bid packages of at least $30,000 equivalent would be
procured on the basis of price quotations from at least three suppliers, provided that the aggregate amount
of such procurement does not exceed US$2.4 million equivalent.
4.18         For contracts estimated at more than US$100,000 equivalent each, the bidding documents
and proposed contract awards would be reviewed by IDA prior to decision on the final awards. It is
estimated that this review would cover about 85% of the total value of the amount contracted for goods
and works financed by IDA. For goods and civil works contracts estimated at less than US$100,000
each, representing about 15% of the value of these contracts, all procurement decisions would be subject
to IDA's selective post-award review.
4.19         Consultants and training financed by IDA, totalling US$7.7 million, would be contracted
in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by
the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981).
4.20         During negotiations Government gave assurances that it will apply the procurement
procedures and arrangements outlined above.
F. Disbursements
4.21         Since the project corresponds to the first three years of the program, disbursements have
been estimated using a four-year period.
4.22         The IDA credit would be disbursed on the basis of categories shown below.

4.23         Disbursement of the IDA credit will be fully documented except for expenditures valued
at less than US$20,000 equivalent, which would be against Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). The
documentation for withdrawals under SOEs would be retained at the PCU for review by IDA staff during
supervision missions and for regular semi-annual audits.
4.24         To facilitate disbursement, Government would open two special accounts in a commercial
bank to cover IDA's share of eligible expenditures: special account A, to be managed by the PCU and
Special Account B, to be managed by the CSU for Health in the MOHSA. The authorized allocations



-41 -
of those Special Accounts would be CFAF 75 million for special account A and CFAF 175 million for
account B. IDA would make initial deposits of those amounts from the proposed credit immediately upon
credit effectiveness. IDA would replenish the special accounts upon receipt of satisfactory proof of
incurred eligible expenditures. Replenishment requests should be accompanied by up-to-date bank
statements and reconciliations of the special accounts.  All applications for direct payments,
reimbursements or requests for special commitments should be for contracts above the equivalent of
US$20,000.
4.25         Government would deposit its counterpart contribution into two separate project accounts
("Caisses d'Avance") that it would open and maintain for financing its share of project costs (about CFAF
25 million for the PCU account and CFAF 50 million for the CSU for Health account).
G. Accounting. Auditing and Reporting
4.26         While each implementing agency would keep its own accounts for project-related
activities, overall responsibility for the project's financial management will rest with the PCU which
would maintain the consolidated project accounts. The PCU would submit to IDA: (a) semi-annual
progress reports on project implementation; (b) annual financial statements on project expenditures;
(c) annual work programs and budgets (as approved by the Interministerial Committee) for the following
year; and (d) a project completion report within nine months of the credit closing date. Project accounts,
including the two special accounts, would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to IDA;
all disbursements under SOEs would be audited semiannually. The audit reports would be submitted to
IDA within six months of the end of the fiscal year.
V. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
5.1          Benefits. The poDulation component would have broad benefits in terms of increased
awareness of population issues and increased receptivity to family planning, especially among women in
rural areas and youth in semi-urban areas. By the end of the project period, family planning services
would be extended to over 350 health posts in the country (from an insignificant number at present), and
over 150 practitioners and pharmacists in the private sector would be able to offer services and
information. Government's ability to coordinate, implement and evaluate population-related action
programs would be strengthened. As a result of the above package of services, the contraceptive
prevalence rate should rise from its current estimated level of 3.4% to around 14% by 1995, and the
momentum would have been set for an increase to around 22% by 2000, assuming the necessary level
of effort is maintained. Restructuring measures in the health sector would help reduce unit costs of basic
health care, making possible a large improvement in quality and coverage with relatively minor increases
in resource use. The exact value of these cost savings is difficult to quantify. They would include
savings on the cost of drugs (around 50-75% decrease in cost per episode), scale economies derived from
integrating vertical programs into the standard service package for health posts and health centers, and
savings on hospital costs of primary cases pre-screened at the post and center levels. Increased
mobilization of private resources to cover the cost of health services would improve the long-term
sustainabilityof gains in quality and coverage and increase accountability within the health service system.
The health component would benefit most of the population through improved availability of drugs and
quality of services, which would increase utilization rates in around half of existing facilities by as much
as three times current levels. In addition, over 3 million people in three regions in the project's zone of



- 42 -
concentration would gain improved access to basic services through a 30% increase in the number of
health posts in these regions. Although the project makes no direct investment at the hospital level,
hospitals will be relieved of present excessive demand for basic care as a result of improved primary- and
secondary-level services and hence be better able to provide specialized services.
5.2          RiskA. The main risks are: (a) the complex nature of the project and consequent potential
implementation difficulties; (b) the many different changes required in policy orientation of Government
at the macro-level, and in the behavior of service providers (district health officers, health post nurses,
"monitrices") at the field level, and the possibility that these changes may not occur at the desired pace;
and (c) heavy dependence on local health committees for resource mobilization at the health post level,
and the difficulty of ensuring their efficient operation. To minimize implementation risks, close attention
has been given during preparation to working out implementation arrangements and inter-ministerial
working relationships; the project will, however, require more than average supervision. Extensive
policy discussions during preparation within Government and between Government and IDA (and
including other donors) improve the chances of continued Government commitment to its newly adopted
policies. To minimize risks stemming from the difficulties in realizing essential changes in the behavior
and attitudes of personnel responsible for carrying out project activities, close attention has been given
to supervision and training aspects of all components. Special efforts to improve CHO organization and
management (including revision of their internal regulations and training for DMOs and HPNs on
supporting the development of CHOs) and information campaigns to clarify the role of CHOs to the
general public would improve their chances of success.
VI. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.1          Prior to negotiations, the Government:
(a)   adopted the list of essential drugs and issued regulations on its application, including
obligatory use by the National Pharmacy, in regional hospitals, health centers and posts,
and by Community Health Organizations (para. 2.42);
(b)   lifted laboratory exam  requirements for prescription of hormonal contraceptives
(para. 3.9);
(c)    provided IDA with the final versions of instructions to: (i) authorize distribution of
contraceptives in pharmaceutical "depots" (para. 3.9); (ii) define the structure and norms
of coverage, function, staffing, management and supervision of the district system and
delineate the 45 health districts in the country (para. 3.36); and
(d)   adopted the program of reform of PNA and authorized special procurement procedures
for PNA (para. 3.51).
6.2          During negotiations, Government and IDA agreed on the list of key measurable indicators
to monitor progress in implementation of the national population program, principal sources of data and
the agencies responsible for collecting them (para. 3.33).



-43 -
6.3          During negotsations, Government gave assurnce that it will:
(a)   ensure that by December 31, 1991, an agreement be signed between the CSU of the MOI
and a banking institution under terms acceptable to IDA (para. 3.26);
(b)   through 1996, implement the redeployment and recruitment measures defined in the
medium-term plan for FY91-96 (para. 3.36);
(c)   increase the percentage share of the government recurrent budget allocated to MOHSA
for the health sector to 5.25% during FY91-92, to 5.75% during FY93, to 6.25% during
FY94, to 6.75% during FY95, and to 7.25% during FY96 (para. 3.41);
(d)   starting with the budget law of FY91-92, revise the presentational form of MOHSA's
budget to clearly delineate drug and material allocations for the 45 districts in the country
(para. 3.41);
(e)   ensure that total drugs and material allocations to the 45 districts be at least 1.5 billion
CFAF in FY91-92, 1.1 billion CFAF in FY93, and that, subsequently through FY96,
this amount increases by at least 10% every year in real terms (para. 3.41):
(f)   ensure that (i) PNA shall submit its requests for replenishment of the commercial bank
account held for the purpose of receiving annual budgetary allocations for drugs every
three months, and (ii) the account shall be replenished within one month of submission
of such request (para. 3.51);
(g)   maintain PNA stocks in conformity with the official list of essential drugs and revise the
list of essential drugs only after prior agreement with IDA (para. 3.52);
(h)   allocate the initial stocks of drugs provided under the project only to those Health Centers
(HCs) and Health Posts (HPs) that meet the agreed upon eligibility criteria (para. 3.55);
(i)    by June 30, 1993, complete the studies on staffing norms for regional hospitals and
specialized structures of MOHSA (Public hygiene, specialized health centers, etc.), and
discuss study findings and recommendations with IDA (para. 3.59);
(j)   ifill positions of the PCU and of the CSUs in MOHSA, MOI, MCWC, and MYS at all
times with personnel whose qualifications and experience are satisfactory to IDA
(para. 4.10);
(k)    by October 30 of each year, beginning in 1992, organize a review meeting to be attended
by Staff of the PCU and CSUs and representatives of IDA in order to review (i) the draft
annual work program and budget for project activities to be undertaken during the next
final year, (ii) the draft recurrent budget for health for the next fiscal year, and (iii) a
draft investment budget for the health sector for the coming three years. The final
versions of the project annual work program and budget for the project and the
investment budget for health would reflect the comments made by IDA (para. 4.11);



-44 -
O)    by June 30, 1994, undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the project (para. 4.12); and
(m)   during project implementation, apply the procurement procedures and arrangements
agreed upon during negotiations (para. 4.20).
6.4          Conditions of credit effectiveness would be that Government would:
(a)   adopt the National FP Program Document, and the decree including FP as part of the
basic MCH package and authorizing HPNs to distribute all types of contraceptives except
IUDs (para. 3.9) as discussed and agreed on at negotiations;
(b)   complete implementation of the redeployment and recruitment measures defined in the
emergency plan for 1990-91 (para. 3.36);
(c)   issue regulations governing the organization and management of CHOs, detailing
procedures for the transformation of existing CHOs to conform with new regulation and
requiring that only CHOs in conformity with new regulations be permitted to operate in
public health facilities (para. 3.43);
(d)   make an initial deposit of CFAF 350 million in a commercial bank account to be held by
PNA (para. 3.51); and
(e)   staff the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and the Component Support Units (CSUs) in
MOHSA, MOI, MCWC and MYS with personnel whose qualifications and experience
are satisfactory to IDA (para. 4.10).
6.5          Recommendation. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the proposed project would
be suitable for an IDA credit of US$35.0 million equivalent on standard IDA terms.

REPUBLIQUE DU SENEGAL
PROJET DE DEVELOPPEMENT DES RESSOURCES H                NMINES
Popuation et Sante
Renforcement du Programme National de Planification Familiale
1.           La composante SMI/PF a pour but de contribuer I la reatisation des objectifs sp6cifiques
d6finis dans le Programme National de Planification Familiale (PF) et d'aider au renforcement global du
systeme de sante. Conformement aux options d6finies et retenues lors des discussions avec les
responsables nationaux, elle s'attachera, en complementarit6 avec l'action des autres bailleurs de fonds -
notamment l'USAID et le FNUAP a:
(a) soutenir et developper les activites visant I 6tendre l'accessibilitd des prestations
integrees de SMI/PF au niveau des postes de sante et ameliorer la qualite des prestations
de service par le renforcement de la supervision formative des postes de sante par le
Medecin chef de district. Les deux domaines d'activites principalement vises sont:
-     I'integration des services cliniques de PF dans l'ensemble des activites de SMI conduites
dans les centres de sante et les postes de sante.
-     le renforcement des services SMI appuyant sur le suivi de la grossesse et des conditions
d'accouchement, la consultation des nourrissons sains, et le renforcement de la
surveillance et de la rEhabilitation nutritionneile.
(b)    developper l'extension des services de PF dans le secteur prive.
(c)    promouvoir l'acceptabilite des services de PF par le renforcement et l'amelioration des
activites d'IEC en matiere de communication interpersonnelle faisant appel I differentes
categories d'agents de terrain (personnel de sante et agents sociaux) et par une action
multimedia de sensibilisation et d'information.
1.    Etendre l'accessibilit6 des servic3s FE au niveau des postes de santE et amEliorer Ia
qualitf de ces prestations
2.           Cette sous-composante a pour but de soutenir et developper les activites visant I etendre
l'accessibilite des prestations de PF et a ameliorer leur qualite particulibrement au niveau des postes de
sante. II s'agit d'atteindre 14% de couverture contraceptive nationale d'ici 1995 et d'installer
l'infrastructure necessaire I la prestation des services PF qui permettrait l'augmentation continue du taux
d'accptabilit6 au-dell de 1995 (& 22% d'ici 2000). Dans los cinq ans k venir, 305.000 femmes
pratiqueront une methode d'espacement des naissances et parmi elles 186.100 utiliseront une methode
modeme de contraception.

Formation en PF des infirmiers chefs de poste
3.           La composante SMI/PF apportera un soutien pour la formation des infirmiers chefs de
poste (ICP) en matibre de PF. 11 s'agit de rationaliser, d'harmoniser et de standardiser la methodologle
de formation, et de standardiser, de produire et de diffuser des manuels d'instructions et des supports de
collecte d'information a leur intention. La formation s'adressera essentiellement aux sujets suivants:
(i) les techniques de contraception pour toutes les methodes, I 1'exception des DIU pour lesquels les
clientes seront renvoyees aux centres de sante; (ii) le "counseling" en PF; (iii) la promotion des activites
de PF au cours des consultations SMI (consultations pre-natales, vaccinations, services curatifs, etc.); et
(iv) le suivi des acceptrices. Au cours des annees ecoulees, nombreux est le personnel de sante qui a
bendfici6 de formation tn matiere de SSP et SMI/PF, tant localement qu'a 1'etranger, pitr le canal des
projets Sante Familiale, Bien-Etre Familial ainsi que par celui du projet "Thies". La duree, le contenu
et la methodologie de ces formations a ete variable portant tantot sur I'amdlioration de l'ensemble du
processus de gestion des SSP (projet Thies), tantot sur le renforcement des connaissances en matibre de
PF (projet SFP), tantot sur une formation en cours d'emploi visant l'ensemble des activites concourrant
I l'amelioration de l'etat de sante du couple mere-enfant (projet BEF). De mOme, des instruments de
support des activites (fiches d'instructions, supports de collecte des donnees, protocole de supervision
etc.), differents dans leur forme et leur contenu selon le projet qui leur a donne naissance, ont ete mis
au point par le biais de ces projets et sont actuellement utilises dans les diffErentes regions du pays.
4.           Avec la mise en oeuvre d'un Programme National de Planification Familiale, dont,
rappelons-le, le volet "prestations cliniques" prdvoit l'integration des services de PF au sein des activites
de SMI, il s'agit maintenant de rationaliser, d'harmoniser et de standardiser la methodologie de formation
du personnel en cours d'emploi en matibre de SMI/PF; de standardiser, produire, diffuser et utiliser des
modules de strategie d'intervention en matiere de SMI/PF I l'intention des medecins chefs des districts
ainsi que des manuels d'instructions et des supports de collecte d'information pour les infirmiers chefs
de postes.
5.           Les modalites retenues pour la formation des ICP sont conformes et s'inskrent dans le
cadre general de la strategie de formation mise au point par le programme a l'intention du personnel des
districts de sante. II est prevu un stage initial theorie/pratique de 15 jours au CS, par groupe de deux,
et la poursuite de la formation, essentiellement assuree par des visites de supervision formative du
medecin chef le district (voir Annexe 3-5).
Approvisionnement en contraceptifs
6.           Une Etude realisee en mai 1990 par le Dr. Boutsen de l'agence d'execution du projet
Bien-Etre Familial (ULB) a estime l'ensemble des besoins en contraceptifs (secteur public et prive
confondus) pour les cinq annees a venir. Cette etude fait appel au modele de Bongaarts et Potter et se
base sur un indice synthetique de fecondite de 5,7 enfants/femmes en l'an 2000. La prevalence
contraceptive parmi les FMAR, toutes methodes, est estimee a 22,2 en 1995 et a 28,0 en I'an 2.000;
celle des methodes modeme a 13,6 en 1995 et 21,8 en 2.000. En complementarite avec lUSAID et le
FNUAP, la composanto SMI/PF contribuera I l'approvisionnement en contraceptifs du secteur public par
le canal de la PNA. La participation du programme DRH en ce domaine sera de 25% des besoins
nationzux du secteur public.

Support aux activitds SMI et nutritionnelles au niveau des Postes de sante
7.            Le succes de la promotion des activites PF au niveau des postes de sant6 d6pend de la
cr6dibilite des services SMI actuellement fournis par ces structures et leur capacite d'attirer des clientes
potentielles en PF. Pour cette raison, le programme renforcerait les services SMI I ce niveau et
s'adresserait particulierement aux consultations pre-natales, le soin des nourrissons sains (y compris le
suivi de la croissante et la vaccination), et la rehabilitation nutritionnelle. Les activites du programme
comprendraient: (a) la formation des infirmiers chefs de poste en prestation des services SMI, la
maintenance des fiches de famille pour le suivi des clientes, et les activites de gestion de temps pour une
meilleure organisation des taches; (b) la provision des equipements et du materiel SMI/PF; (c) le
developpement des approches operationnelles pour la surveillance et l'Education nutritionnelles, y compris
les activites suivantes a titre d'essai: le marketing social des fiches de croissance, l'introduction des
activites nutritionnelles aux activites des groupements feminins ainsi que des structures sociales (centres
sociaux, etc.) et le renforcement des activites en nutrition des agents de sante communautaires; et (d) la
formulation d'une strategie nationale ainsi qu'un programme pour les activites nutritionnelles tenant
compte des resultats des diffdrentes experiences.
8.            Outre la PF, le contenu de la formation en SMI s'adressera essentiellement aux sujets
suivants: consultation prenatale; surveillance et pratique de l'accouchement; PEV; nutrition; lutte contre
la diarrhee; consultation de nourrissons; et MST. Chacun de ces sujets fera l'objet d'un module de
strategie destine au medecin chef de district ainsi que d'une fiche d'instruction technique destinee aux
infirmiers chefs de poste. Ces modules d'instruction serviront egalement de cadre de reference pour la
supervision des structures sanitaires effectuee par les medecins chefs de districts. De la mOme fagon que
pour la formation en PF, la formation SM! s'insererait dans le cadre general de la strat6gte de formation
4 l'intention du personnel des districts de sante de la composante "districts sanitaires".
9.            A 1'exclusion de ceux des trois rEgions de Dakar, Thies et Diourbel - qui seront equipes
au titre du volet "districts sanitaires" - les postes de sante des autres regions du pays seront equipEs de
petit materiel medical et de bureau necessaire aux activites de SMI/PF. Les quantites et la nature exacte
des equipements a fournir ne pourra etre etablie qu'apres inventaire detaille des equipements - et de leur
tat - existant dans les postes de sante et sera 6galement fonction des apports de l'USAID et du FNUAP
en ce domaine. Chaque district des sept region sera dote en equipement et mobilier d'une valeur
maximum de 5 million FCFA pour reequiper et remeubler les PS existants et transformes. Le MCD
determinera les besoins prioritaires des PS de son district sur la base d'une liste d'equipement et mobilier
standards; celui-ci soumettra sa demande k l'Unite de Coordination du Projet au sein du MSPAS qui sera
charge de l'acquisition de l'dquipement pour tous les districts.
Amelioration de l'enseignement en PF des ecoles de Sante Publigue
10.          La gdneralisation de l'integration des activites de planification familiale dans les activitds
de SMI implique que les futurs infirmiers, infirmitres et sages-femmes soient formes dans ce domaine
au cours de leurs etudes. Une revision des curricula de formation de base en ce sens s'avbre donc
necessaire.
11.           Une Commission ad hoc (task force) composee d'une douzaine de personnes, membres
du corps enseignant et utilisateurs du personnel de sante, sera chargee de revoir et d'actualiser les
programmes d'enseignement des infirmier(e)s et sages-femmes d'Etat. A partir des tches et
responsabilites confiees sur le terrain I ces agents, la commission elaborera un module d'enseignement
en matibre de SMI/PF base sur des objectifs d'apprentissage (savoir, savoir ftre, savoir faire) et

presentant la methodologie d'enseignement a appliquer (cours theorique, demonstration, travaux pratiques,
stages etc.). Elle elaborera egalement des documents de reference destinds aux eleves.
12.          La commission se rdunira une premibre fois en seance plenibre pendant une semaine afin
de definir sa methode de travail, preciser les r6sultats attendus, et repartir les thches techniques de
revision, actualisation, redaction parmi ses membres. En groupes de travail plus restreint ces derniers
procederont pendant un mois a l'elaboration de leur partie respective. Lors d'une deuxieme reunion
pldnibre, la Commission examinera les resultats de ce premier travail et y apportera les modifications
jugees necessaires avant la publication des nouveaux modules d'enseignement et des documents de
reference destines aux eleves.
13.          Le programme apportera un soutien a l'actualisation de la formation de base des
infirmier(e)s et sages-femmes d'Etat pour:
(i)   la revision des curricula de formation:
-     assistance technique;
-     frais de fonctionnement et support administratif de la Commission chargee de la
revision des curricula;
-     organisation de seminaires ateliers de la Commission.
(ii)   la production de documents et de materiel didactique:

Page 5 sur 10
(iv)   la realisation, en 1989, d'une etude sur la commercialisation des contraceptifs et des
preservatifs sur le march6 libre qui a conclu qu'environ 17.500 femmes utilisent une
methode contraceptive moderne par le canal des cabinets medicaux, cliniques privees et
officines pharmaceutiques.
Des 1988, le Directeur de cette composante a entrepris des d6marches administratives et lgales aupres
des instances gouvernementales concernees afin de cr6er une ONG susceptible de prendre la relbve des
activitds initi6es par le volet VSPP. Cette ONG, intitul6e "Sant6 de la Famille" (SANFAM) a vu
officiellement le jour le 8 juin 1988.
15.          Afin de maximaliser les acquis, de poursuivre les initiatives entreprises par le volet VSPP
et d'innover d'autres approches en vue d'etendre l'acces aux services de PF dans le secteur prive,
SANFAM s'est tourne vers differents bailleurs de fonds susceptibles de l'aider I poursuivre et I
d6velopper ses programmes d'action. Dans cette perspective, la composante 'SMI/PF" du programme
DRH se propose d'apporter un soutient a SANFAM ou toute autre ONG qui serait jug6e apte a la fois
par le MSPAS et l'IDA dans les domaines suivants:
(i)   la poursuite du programme d'appui au d6marrage d'activit6s de PP dans les formations
sanitaires des entreprise privees et semi publiques;
(ii)   le renforcement et la consolidation des activit6s de PF dans les structures sanitaires des
entreprises ayant ben6ficie pr6c4demment du concours du VSPP;

18.          Participation du secteur pharmaceutique aux activitds de PF. II existe au S6negal 160
pharmacies privees et 200 depots pharmaceutiques. Commenc6 en juin 1988 par un s6minaire
d'information et de sensibilisation de 60 pharmaciens et suivi en juin 90 par un second s6minaire
interessant 35 pharmaciens, le programme intensifiera ces efforts en vue d'accrottre la participation du
secteur pharmaceutique priv6 dans 1'activit6 de sante familiale et de PF. Ce programme a pour objectif
d'accrottre l'utilisation de la contraception orale et des condoms dans le secteur pharmaceutique de 17.362
utilisatrices en 1989 a 28.186 en 1995 soit une augmentation de 62% en six ans.
19.          Dans le cadre de ce programme, SANFAM ou une autre ONG, qui fen.t appel I
l'USAID pour son approvisionnement, pourra vendre aux officines pharmaceutiques les contraceptifs
oraux a raison de 75 FCFA le cycle et les condoms I raison de 35 FCFA l'unit6. Es seront revendus
sur le marche public aux prix respectifs de 100 FCFA le cycle de pilule et 50 FCFA le condom.
20.          Le programme soutiendra la formation en technologie de la contraception, IEC et

de prendre en charge une partie des frais de fonctionnement des ONG pour un montant equivalent a 20%
des composantes du volet.
Soutien aux activit6s de l'ASBEF
22.          PlacE sous la tutelle du MSPAS, I'ASBEF - ONG affili6e I l'IPPF - dispose d'un Bureau
National a Dakar qui comprend des services administratifs, des services techniques (IEC et Programmes)
et une clinique qui offre, outre des services de PF, des consultations prenatales, de gyn6cologie (y
compris le traitement des MST et des services relatifs a l'infecondit6) et de p6diatrie.
23.          Les activit6s d'lEC de l'Association sont principalement ax6es sur des causeries sur la
PF et 1'6ducation I la vie familiale, destin6es aux clientes de la clinique ainsi qu'aux membres de
structures informelles (associations de jeunes, groupements f6minins), sur la formation de monitrices
d'6ducation familiale rurales, sur la conception, la production et 'a diffusion de matEriel de vulgarisation

dans la presse et magasines locaux). Enfin I'ASBEF forme des stagiaires sages-femmes et m6decins en
PF (nationaux et etrangers) dans ses cliniques de Dakar et de Louga.
24.          Les ressources de I'ASBEF proviennent essentiellement de l'IPPF qui, pour un montant
d'environ 100 millions de FCFA par an prend en charge les frais de fonctionnement (y compris les
salaires du personnel), I'approvisionnement en contraceptif& et le financement de certains projets.
D'autres bailleurs de fonds appuient actuellement ou prevoient appuyer les investissements et les coats
recurrents de I'ASBEF, y compris l'USAID, la Cooperation japonaise, les Pays-Bas et le GTZ.
25.          Trois antennes regionales sont en instance de s'ouvrir: a Ziguinchor - avec l'assistance
du FNUAP; I St Louis - avec l'assistance du Pathfinder Fund; et I Kaolack - avec l'assistance de la
Fondation Ford.

26.           La composante SMI/PF du programme DRH se propose de soutenir les activites de
l'ASBEF dans trois domaines: (i) le renforcement de ses capacites de gestion; (ii) un soutien I ses
activites socio-educatives; et (iii) un soutien a l'extension de ses activites cliniques.
27.           Renforcement des capacites de Gestion de l'ASBEF. L'objectif de ce volet est de
permettre h I'ASBEF de renforcer ses capacites institutionnelles en matiere de collecte et d'exploitation
des donnees des services cliniques et IEC, d'evaluer ses actions en ces domaines et d'ameliorer la qualite
des services fournis. Le programme prendra en charge la formation du personnel de l'ASBEF a
l'utilisation du nouveau systeme de collecte/analyse des donnees, I'achat de l'equipement informatique
pour le siege, et les frais de fonctionnement de cet equipement.
28.           Formation d'animatrices en education a la vie familiale (EVF). Ce volet a pour objectif
de poursuivre et d'etendre, a Dakar, S.t Louis et Ziguinchor, les actions de sensibilisation de
groupements de femmes en EVF et PF par le canal d'animatrices choisies au sein de ces groupements.
Le programme soutiendra la formation de 15 animatrices dans chacune de ces regions ainsi que les frais
de suivi/evaluation de leurs activites.
29.           Causeries educatives. II s'agit egalement ici de permettre I I'ASBEF de poursuivre une
activite en cours depuis 1984 a savoir le deroulement de causeries, effectuees par le personnel volontaire
de chaque antenne, aupres d'associations de femmes, de jeunes et des habitants des quartiers populaires
et des zones rurales. En 1987 et 1988, environ 7.000 hommes et femmes ont ete touches (chaque annee)
par ces causeries. Le programme soutiendra l'organisation materielle des causeries (transport, location
de chaises, frais de publicite).
30.           Publication d'un bulletin d'information. L'objectif de ce volet est de permettre une
meilleure circulation de l'information entre le staff et les volontaires de 1'ASBEF, ainsi que d'ameliorer
l'information entre les differents acteurs concernes par la PF par la production et la diffusion d'un bulletin
trimestriel. Ce bulletin devrait 6galement permettre de faire mieux connattre et de susciter l'adhesion aux
objectifs et aux activites de I'ASBEF et d'6largir la base des volontaires de l'Association. Le programme
soutiendra cette initiative par l'achat d'un petit 6quipement photographique, les frais de publication et les
frais de diffusion du bulletin.
31.           Foire de Dakar. Tous les deux ans, I'ASBEF participe I la foire de Dakar, par la tenue
d'un stand oti sont expos6s des contraceptifs et du mat6riel publicitaire. En 1988, on a estim6 a 20%
I'augmentation des nouveaux/nouvelles accepteurs(-trices) de PF dana les deux mois qui ont suivi la foire.
L'objectif de ce volet est de poursuivre cette action de sensibilisation/information du pub;ic lors de la
foire de Dakar par une exposition permanente, des causeries, des services conseils et la distribution de
contraceptifs. Le programme contribuera aux frais d'organisation et de fonctionnement de cette activite
de I'ASBEF (fournitures diverses, location, carburant, repas du personnel).
32.          IntEgration de, 'Education a la Vie Familiale aux activites socio-&ucative du Centre de
Sauvegarde de Pikine. Le Centre de Sauvegarde de Pikine est une structure de reinsertion scolaire,
sociale et professionnelle qui accueille un peu plus de 1.000 jeunes filles et gargons, soit places sur
decision judiciaire, soit places volontairement par leur parents. Les risques de delinquance juvenile,
d'usage de drogue, de MST, de grossesse chez les adolescentes y sont eleves. L'objectif de ce volet est
d'6duquer ces jeunes filles et garcons a la vie familiale, d'am6liorer la qualite de la formation
professionnelle et d'6radiquer les cas de grossesses. Le programme soutiendra les efforts de 1'ASBEF
en ce sens par la formation d'Educateurs, l'organisation de journ6es d'information pour les parents

d'eleves, de l'equipement technique de menuiserie, de l'equipement IEC audio-visuel, du mobilier pour
l'enseignement secondaire, un equipement de labo-photo, de l'equipement de couture pour la section
feminine, la motivation des educateurs et la vacation d'un professeur d'economie familiale.
33.          Extension des activites cliniques de I'ASBEP. Au cours de la mission d'evaluation,
I'ASBEF a emis le souhait d'ouvrir une antenne regionale I Kolda. Les objectifs sont semblables I ceux
des autres antennes regionales, I savoir: (i) sensibiliser 1.500 hommes et femmes en age de procreer
aux avantages de la planification familiale; et (ii) offrir des services de PF, integres aux activites de SMI,
a 500 nouveaux accepteurs/acceptrices par an. Le programme contribuera I l'ouverture de cette nouvelle
antenne par un support a l'organisation de la structure des volontaires (per diem et transport des
responsables du siege), les frais de fonctionnement de l'antenne (ocation des batiments, salaire du
personnel, frais de fonctionnement divers), du materiel de bureau et de l'equipement medical.
3.    Promouvoir les services de SMI/PF par le renfoncement et I'amelioration des
acivitdEC
Amelioration des activites de communication interpersonnelle
34.          La contribution de la composante SMI/PF se concretisera par un soutien a:
(a)   l'execution, pendant la premibre annde d'implementation du programme, d'une importante etude
d'evaluation des activites IEC menees sur le terrain, en vue (i) d'identifier les contraintes
organisationnelles et op6rationnelles qui affectent leur bonne execution, (ii) d'evaluer l'adequation
et l'impact de la formation IEC dispensee aux agents sociaux, et (iii) de formuler des
recommandations en vue d'am6liorer l'organisation, le fonctionnement et la gestion des activites
IEC sur le terrain avec l'accent sur la possibilite d'appliquer des principes "formation et visite"
du systeme de vulgarisation agricole (es termes de reference de cette Etude sont trouves ci-joint
k cette annexe); et
(b)   la mise en pratique des recommandations de cette evaluation concernant (i) I'amelioration des
methodologies de travail (suivi et supervision, evaluation continue), (ii) le developpement
d'instruments de collecte des donnees et d'evaluation des performances, (iii) une revision des
contenus et methodologies des programmes de formation/recyclage, et (iv) une meilleure
utilisation du materiel de support didactique a la communication.
(c)   l'extension de la couverture de la communication interpersonnelle par la formation des agents de
terrain (du MI et du MSPAS) et des auxiliaires benevoles.
35.          Les efforts en matiere de formation du personnel et de renforcement des capacites de
gestion des activites d'IEC au niveau regional et departemental se feront de fagon progressive en
s'appuyant sur les acquis et les experiences des annees precedentes. 11 est prevu que chaque region
disposera de dix personnes "fonctionnelles", c'est-a-dire ayant acquis les connaissances, et capables de
les mettre en application, en matiere de planification/gestion/evaluation permanente de programmes IEC
et susceptibles de former les agents de terrain, de suivre et de superviser leurs activites. Au niveau local,
chaque departement disposera de 20 agents "fonctionnels" - dont notamment des auxiliaires - qui
connaftront leur population cible, seront capables de l'encadrer selon un programme de travail defini
comportant des objectifs quantifies, qui disposeront de supports audiovisuels appropries et qui seront
regulierement suivi et supervise par le personnel regional. Au total, 100 responsables regionaux et 600
agents de terrain au niveau departemental seront formes k ces fins.

Renforcement des capacites de production/diffusion
36.          Dans le souci de permettre I la cellule EEC du niveau central de soutenir l'action du
personnel de terrain, le programme completera l'equipement technique de l'EPS necessaire I la
production du materiel de support a la communication interpersonnelle.  Le materiel prodult
(flanellographes, botte I image, depliants, brochures etc.) sera diffuse dans les regions et departements
afin d'etre utilise par les differents agents sociaux - notamment ceux du MSPAS et du Ministere de
l'Interieur - lors de leurs activites d'information et d'education en direction de leur population cible
respective.
Ddevelo2pement et l'execution de programmes d'action IEC en matiere de PF I transmettre par les mass
37.          Les objectifs fondamentaux sont de:
(a)   sensibiliser les leaders et cadres nationaux, regionaux et departementaux au contenu et I
l'application de la politique nationale de population;
(b)   sensibiliser le grand public aux thbmes pronant la necessite d'un equilibre entre ressources
humaines et ressources physiques du pays en vue d'assurer son developpement social et
Economique;
(c)    eduquer et informer les adolescent(e)s sur les probl&mes associes I la sexualite (MST, SIDA,
grossesses non desirees);
(d)    promouvoir la connaissance des consequences nefastes d'une sexualite irresponsable et d'une
fEconditd elevee en vue d'accroitre l'utilisation de la contraception; et
(e)    coordonner et rationaliser les activites et interventions de divers departements et organismes et
leur apporter un appui technique, materiel et financer dans l'execution de programmes lies I la
politique de population.
38.          La realisation de ce programme d'action sera sous-traitee I l'Unite de communication
(UNICOM), financee par le FNUAP. Le soutien du programme I UNICOM se fera par le canal de
l'EPS, mattre d'oeuvre de toutes les activites IEC-PF dans le cadre du programme. Les themes a
aborder, le contenu et la forme des messages I produire ainsi que les canaux de diffusion a utiliser seront
definis de concert avec UNICOM.
39.          Le programme financera essentiellement les productions mediatiques en relation directe
avec la planification familiale (spots radio, production de romans et magazines radiophoniques, spots
dramatiques et sketchs televises, publication d'articles de presse, de romans photos et de bandes
dessinees), laissant au financement FNUAP les productions relevant d'autre themes en relation avec la
dynamique de la population. Le programme soutiendra egalement la mise en oeuvre de mecanismes
d'evaluation permanents de l'impact des programmes multimddia en tant qu'outils indispensables b
l'ameliorat{on et k I'affinement des messages, a la sElection des audiences et I la poursuite d'activites
multimedia readaptEes de fa&on permanents aux populations cibles.

40.           La restructuration organique du MSPAS a confie au Service de l'Education pour la Sante
(BPS) la responsabilit6 des activitds d'IEC relatives I la SMIVPF. Une cellule IEC-SMI/PF a ete
spdcifiquement creee pour mener I bien ces activites; elle sera plus particulierement chargee de:
(a)    concevoir des strategies et developper des programmes d'action IEC en matiere de PP. L'accent
portera notamment sur l'amelioration de la qualite de la communication interpersonnelle des
agents socio-sanitaires de terrain;
(b)    produire et tester du materiel de support audio-visuel destine I ces agents;
(c)    rationaliser, coordonner, assurer le suivi et evaluer les activitds IEC menees sur le terrain (en
collaboration avec d'autres ministeres concernes);
(d)    entreprendre des recherches operationnelles;
(e)    participer aux actions de formation/recyclage du personnel de terrain; et
(f)    proceder I l'identification des axes de communication et definir les messages I transmettre par
les mass media.
41.           La composante SMI/PF soutiendra le renforcement institutionnel de la cellule IEC/SMI/PF
du Service EPS. Une attention particulibre sera accordee aux moyens d'appliquer les techniques de
marketing social k la promotion de PF ainsi qu'au developpement de cette capacite au sein de l'Unite de
l'Education pour la Sante (EPS). A cette fin, l'Unite EPS recevrait une assistance visant l'etablissement
d'un accord de type "jumelage" avec une firme ou autre institution dot6e d'une experience appropriee en
marketing (e.g., une equipe de marketing commercial); celle-ci serait chargde de la formulation de
strategies et le transferts du savoir-faire. Le programme soutiendrait egalement les activites suivantes:
(i) une bourse de formation d'un agent du Service de l'EPS pour l'obtention d'une maltrise en psycho-
sociologie ou en communication; (ii) le renforcement technique du personnel de la cellule EEC en
planification familiale (stages de specialisation k court terme); (iii) la prise en charge pour 2 ans du salaire
du maquettiste/dessinateur dont le contrat se termine fin 1991; (iv) la fourniture de materiel de bureau,
de l'equipement technique et d'un vehicule de supervision; et (v) une participation aux frais de
fonctionnement de cette unite.
42.           En outre, le programme apporterait son appui I la realisation de quatre etudes du type
"market research" dont les themes devront etre precises au cours de l'assistance technique sur le
marketing et en fonction des connaissances acquises par des etudes anterieures (eviter les duplications),
viser I confirmer ou infirmer des hypotheses d'ordre clinique, motivationnel ou autre (pourquoi?) et
susceptibles d'identifier des axes d'intervention realistes (comment?). Commanditees par l'EPS, elles
feront appel t des ressources nationales - instituts de recherches, professeurs/staff universitaire, etudiants
(these de fin d'Etudes) pour leur execution.

APPENDICE
Etude/Analyse du personnel de terrain pour les activites
d'information d'&ducation et de communication en matiere de SMIIPF
Information de Base
1.    Le Ministbre de l'Interieur et la Direction de l'Action Sociale du Ministbre de k Sante comptent
1012 agents de differentes categories (monitrices et mattresses d'economie faniliale, assistantes sociales,
inspecteurs et agents techniques d'animation, etc.). Parmi eux, environ 350 ont ete form6s en differents
domaines touchant la PF (management et gestion des programmes de PF, techniques de communication,
techniques audiovisuelles, etc.). De plus, ces deux ministbres beneficient du concours benevole de 515
auxiliaires dont 478 ont ete formes pendant une semaine en technique d'IEC/PF.
2.    Ces differentes categories d'agents travaillent dans differentes structures ou sont en contact direct
avec les populations qu'Us encadrent. Ils mettent en oeuvre des strategies diverses pour toucher
differentes populations cibles et utilisent des supports pedagogiques mis I leur disposition par le biais des
projets Sante Familiale et Bien-Etre Familial.
3.    Avant de poursuivre le recyclage et la formation de plusieurs centaines d'agents et de milliers
d'auxiliaires, il importe de se pencher sur le devenir de ces agents et auxiliaires, apres leur formation,
d'analyser les mecanismes de fonctionnement de leurs activit6s et d'evaluer l'efficacite et l'impact des
investissements deja consentis. En d'autres termes, U s'agit de repondre aux questions suivantes:
qu'attend-t-on des differentes categories d'agents sociaux en matiere d'IEC/PF?
comment s'articulent les activites d'IEC/PF dans l'ensemble des taches attribuees a ces
agents?
dans quelle mesure, comment et avec quel impact les agents formes au cours des annees
precedentes interviennent-Uls en matibre d'IEC/PF sur le terrain?
dans quel type de structure travaillent ces agents (par structure il faut entendre: maisons
de jeunes, foyers feminins, maisons communautaires, comite rdgional ou departement de
developpement, CER, etc.)?
quelles sont leurs activites et leur domaines d'intervention specifique?
quelle est la taille et la nature des populations cibles prises en charge par la structure
considkree, tel que par exemple: les associations de jeunes, les groupements feminins,
les quartiers urbains ou sub-urbains, les villages, etc.?
quelles sont les strategies utiisees pour toucher les populations cibles: communication
interpersonnelle, individuelle, reunions de groupe, organisation de conference, etc.?

-      avec quelles frequences leg populations cibles sont-elles touchees?
-      quel est la nature et les quantitds de materiel de support existant dont dispose ce
personnel?
-      par qui et comment s'effectue la supervision de ce personnel?
-      quel sont les besoins, au niveau du terrain, pour ameliorer et rentabiliser davantage les
activitds d'IEClPF des agents sociaux et des auxillaires?
Objectif general de I'etude
4.     L'objectif fondamental de l'etude est d'ameliorer la qualite et l'organisation des services d'IEC
en matibre de planification familiale et de sante de la mere et de l'enfant offert par le personnel social
et les auxiliaires des Ministeres de l'Interieur et de la Direction de I'Action Sociale.
5.     A cette fin, 1'4tude comprendra trois parties:
preninbre partie: analyse et evaluation des potentialites du terrain
deuxibme partie: identification des voie et moyens pour ameliorer la qualitd des actions
IEC et l'efficacite des agents de terrain
troisibme partie: mise en pratique des recommandations de cette etude/evaluation au
niveau des regions et districts.
Resnonsabilite de l'etude
6.     La responsabilite gen6rale de 1'exdcution de cette etude sera confiee au Service de I'Education
pour la SantE du MSPAS, assiste de deux consultants finances au titre du Projet DRH: I'un, specialiste
en IEC/PF et I'autre en systbme de vulgarisation agricole pour la formation et les visites.
Termes de refErence
7.     Dans un premier temps, I'equipe charg6e de cette etude et les consultants s'attacheront a:
-      faire l'inventaire de l'ensemble des agents sociaux de terrain, par categorie, affectation
gEographique, et appartenance a l'un ou I l'autre ministbre
-      identifier les structures formelles et informelles dans lesquelles operent ces agents
-      analyser les tAches et les responsabilites des differentes categories d'agents de terrains
-      evaluer qualitativement et quantitativement les actions d'IEC menees en matibre de SMI/PF par
les agents sociaux et les auxiliaires formes au cours des annees precddentes (strategies
d'interventions, populations touchees)
-      evaluer l'adequation des programmes de formation/recyclage (dureo, contenu, methodologie) de
ces agents aux tAches specifiques attendues des diff6rentes categorie d'agents

identifier les contraintes organisationnelles et operationnelles qui affectent la bonne execution des
activites IEC sur le terrain, telles que par exemple: manque de programmation des activites,
absence d'objectifs precls, insuffisance de supervision/suivi des agents et auxillaires, manque
d'instructions, defaillance du systeme de collecte des donnees, insuffisance de moyens pour
assurer leur mobilite, etc.
-      formuler des recommandations specifiques en vue d'ameliorer l'organisation, le fonctionnement
et la gestion des activitds d'IEC des agents sociaux de terrain en appliquant notamment les
principes de l'organisation du travail et I la supervision des agents sociaux.
Ce systeme repose sur les principes de base suivants: professionnalisme, chatne de responsabilite unique,
concentration des efforts, calendrier de travail, orientation vers des populations ciblees, formation
r6guliere et continue, lien avec la recherche.
Methodologie do 1'etude
B.     L'etude pourrait se derouler selon quatre axes d'investigations.
(a)    Enquete par questionnaire, envoy6 aux agents sociaux et aux auxiliaires qui ont ete formes dans
les annees precedentes en matibre d'IEC. Un tel questionnaire viserait essentiellement a: (i)
recueillir des informations sur la perception des agents formes en IEC sur l'adequation, la
pertinence et la mise en pratique des acquis de ces formations, tels que pergus par ces agents; (ii)
recueillir leurs observations d'ordre pratique sur les difficultts qu'its rencontrent dans l'execution
de leur tftches; (iii) recueillir des informations quantitatives sur le nombre de personnes qu'ils
touchent et informent en matiWre de SMI/PF.
(b)    Des interviews d'un echantillon representatif des principales categories d'agents de terrain et de
leur sup6rieurs (chef de CER, inspecteur regional et departemental du developpement social, etc.)
(c)    L'analyse des documents existants (structures, effectifs..) au niveau du Ministere de l'Interieur,
de la Direction des Affaires Sociales, de la Delegation de la Condition de la Femme et de
l'Enfant et des rapports d'activites de ces agents au niveau des projets Sante Familiale et Bien-
Etre familial.
(d)    Des interviews des repr6sentants de certains groupes cibles touches par ces agents (associations
feminines, notables, villageois, personnes d'un quartier encadr6 par des monitrices et/ou
auxiliaires).
9.     Ces analyses devraient deboucher sur des recommandations pratiques en matiere de:  (i)
organisation, gestion, programmation des activites I mener sur le terrain; (ii) mise au point de strategies
de suivi et de supervision; (iii) mise au point d'un systeme d'evaluation continue de l'impact des actions
IEC menees par ces agents; (iv) developpement d'instruments de collecte des donnees et d'evaluation des
performances; (v) amelioration des methodologies de travail (identification des populations et des groupes
cibles prioritaires I toucher par ces diffdrentes categories d'agents; elaboration de canevas de programmes
d'action detaille, mensuel ou trimestriel; mise au point de stratEgies d'intervention (par exemple, combien
de causerie, k qui, par qui, quand, oi, avec quel support...); (vi) revision (si besoin) des contenus et des
methodologies appliquEe dans les programmes de formation/recyclage; (vii) revision (si besoin) des
messages I transmettre; et (viii) identification des supports et materiel pedagogiques necessaires k l'action
d'IEC des agents soclaux du terrain.

Appication prlatigue
10.   Dans un deuAieme temps, la cellule IEC de SMI/PF de I'EPS procedera I la mise en application
des mecanismes de gestion, suivi et evaluation des activites IEC dans les regions et districts. Plusieurs
interventions sont prdvues a cet effet.
(a)    Formation des responsables regionaux et departementaux: organisation d'un sdminaire atelier
rdunissant des responsables du Ministbre de l'Interieur, de la Direction de l'Action Sociale du
MSP, les responsables de la division de l'Education pour la Sante, les membres de la cellule
IEC/recherche et les responsables regionaux et ddpartementaux de la region test afin d'analyser
le contenu de l'etude mentionnee precedemment et mettre au point les modalites d'application
concretes des recommandations de cette etude dans les regions et departements.
Formation des responsables regionaux et departementaux du Ministere de l'Interieur et de l'EPS
I l'organisation et la gestion des activites IEC. Cette formation se fera selon les modalites
suivantes: organisation d'une ceision de formation d'une semaine par r6gion animti par quatre
membres du niveau central suivie de visites de supervision/formation I raison de cinq jours par
mois dans la region par un ou deux membres du niveau central; fourniture du materiel et des
6quipements techniques necessaires:   matdriel de bureau, equipement audio-visuel,
flanellographes, affiches, depliants, films, video, support de collecte d'information, moyen
logistique.
(b)    Formation du personnel de terrain: auxiliaires et autres relais. Parallelement k la mise en oeuvre
de mecanismes de planification/gestion des activitds EEC dans une region, on procedera I la
formation et/ou au recyclage des agents du MI et de la DAS de cette region ainsi qu'k la
formation d'buxiliaires. Le principal directeur, tout en guidant les activites de formation,
s'Eloignera autant que possible des seminaires et cessions de recyclage classiques pour s'orienter
davantage vers une veritable strategie de formation en cours d'emploi, sur le terrain et le lieu de
travail, par l'instauration d'une supervision formative permanente. Certes des cessions de
formation formelles seront toujours necessaires - notamment pour la formation des auxiliaire -
mais le suivi, 1'encadrement, la motivation des agents et des auxiliaires sera renforce par la mise
en application d'un systbme de supervisinn I tous les niveaux.
11.   Durant la premiere annee du projet, les efforts en matibre de renforcement des capacites de
gestion des activites d'IEC des structures rdgionales et d6partementales du MDS et de formation du
personnel se concentreront dans une region. Ulterieurement, ils seront progressivement etendus aux
autres regions, en s'appuyant sur les acquis et les experiences des annees precedentes.
12.   11 est prdvu que chaque region disposera de 10 personnes "fonctionnelles', c'est-k-dire ayant
acquis les connaissances, et capable de les mettre en application, en matiBre de
planificationlgestion/evaluation permanente de programmes IEC et susceptibles de former les agents de
terrain, de suivre et de superviser leurs activitEs. Au niveau local, chaque ddpartement disposera de 20
agents ("fonctionnels" - dont notamment des auxiliaires - qui connattront leur population cible, seront
capables de l'encadrer selon un programme de travail defini comportant des objectifs quantifies, qui
disposeront de supports audiovisuels appropries et qui seront rEgulibrement suivi et supervisE par le
personnel rEgional.

REPUBLIQUE DU SENEGAL
PROJET DE DEVELOPPEMENT DES RESSOURCES HUMAINES
Population et Sante
Promotion du Statut de la Femme
1.           Cette composante s'inscrit dans une perspective de responsabilisation des groupements
de femmes afin que celles-ci maftrisent leur d6veloppement ant sur le plan social qu'economique. Elle
a pour objectif d'entreprendre, voire d'etendre certaines actions specifiques en faveur des femmes pour
faciliter leur participation plus effective a l'effort national dans le cadre de la Politique de Population.
Elle s'appuie essentiellement sur le reseau existant de groupements de femmes et d'unions locales
d'arrondissement de groupements de femmes, qui servent de vehicule aux actions entreprises pour
ameliorer le statut des femmes.
2.           Les activites prevues concernent:
(ik)         I'alphab6tisation fonctionnelle des femmes;
(ii)         I'extension des case-foyers dans 45 arrondissements;
(iii)        la fourniture d'equipements pour l'allegement des travaux domestiques; et
(iv)         le renforcement institutionnel du Ministbre Delegue de la Condition de la Femme
et de l'Enfant (MCFE).
3.           La composante PSF interviendra dans cinq regions du Senegal (Fatik, Kaolack, Louga,
St. Louis et Ziguinchor) choisies compte tenu de leur nombre elev6 de groupements de femmes et du
dynamisme de ces derniers. Au total 375 groupements et 45 unions locales d'arrondissement ont etW
selectionnes.
4.           La r6ussite de cette composante depend de l'organisation efficace des operations de terrain
par les "monitrices" des Centres d'expansion rurale du Ministre de l'Interieur et de la formation qui leur
sera dispensde. Une evaluation des operations de terrain et la refonte du programme de formation des
monitrices sont prevues au titre de la composante PF-IEC.
1.    Alphab_tIsation fonctionnelle des femmes
5.           Le taux d'analphabetisme des femmes senegalaises est de 81% en moyenne et atteint des
pointes de 91% (rdgion de Louga). 11 semble egalement trbs eleve dans les groupements de femmes otx
il est a la source de plusieurs problames (de gestion, de contr6le, de developpement des activit6s, de
representation et de pouvoir des femmes, d'information, d'accbs au credit).  L'alphabtisation
fonctionnelle est donc une condition essentielle pour la promotion de ces groupements et le developpement
d'activitds economiques rentables.

Obiectifs
6.            Les objectifs de cette sous-composante sont:
(a)    d'amener les femmes I sortir de leur etat d'analphabetisme par I'acquisition de connaissances en
lecture. ecriture et calcul dans les langues nationales;
(b)    d'initier les femmes aux techniques de gestion pour ameliorer le suivi, le developpement et la
rentabilite de leurs activites economiques; et
(c)    de favoriser chez les femmes une meilleure apprehension des problemes de sante, de nutrition et
de planning familial.
La population cible
7.            Cette sous-composante doit assurer en priorite I'alphabetisation fonctionnelle des membre
des comites de gestion des 375 groupements de femmes (impliques dans la gestion des equipement
d'alldgement des taches) et des 45 unions locales (impliquees dans la gestion des cases-foyers) soit, I
raison de 15 femmes par groupement/union, en total de 6.300 femmes.
Programmes et materiel pdedagogique
8.            Les activites de l'alphabetisation fonctionnelle se derouleront en six etapes. 11 s'agit de:
(a)    la sensibilisation des autorites et membres des groupements feminins des cinq regions retenues
lors d"q missions des responsables du programme;
(b)    I'etude du milieu, analyse des problemes et des besoins exprimes ou ressentis. Cette etude sera
entreprise par l'unite d'alphabetisation de l'Unite de Coordination du Projet (UCP) au sein du
Ministere de l'Interieur lors des missions de sensibilisation;
(c)    I'elaboration des programmes et materiels d'alphabEtistion et de post-alphabetisation. C'est au
cours d'un seminaire atelier qui regroupera les spEcialistes du UCP, les monitrices d'economie
familiale et d'autres specialistes, que le programme d'alphabEtisation sera congu et elabore;
(d)   la formation des monitrices et des alphabetisatrices dans les mEthodes d'alphabdtisation
fonctionnelle et dans les techniques d'evaluation. Pour les monitrices, il est pr6-'u: (i) une
formation initiale en alphabetisation fonctionnelle de 30 jours; (ii) une formation I la mdthodes
participative de 15 jours; et (iii) une formation en dvaluation et en post-alphabetisation de 15
jours. Quant aux alphabetisatrices, elle se recevront une formation initiale de 30 jours, suivie
de deux recyclages annuel de dix jours. Certains de ces recyclages seront consacres I l'utilisation
des instruments d'evaluation, et d'autre en 3e et 4e annee notamment, seront consacres aux
activites de post-alphabetisation;
(e)    1'execution du programme se fera en deux phases de six mois chacune, phases qui seront suivies
d'activites de post-alphab6tisation. Le ddmarrage des cours d'alphabdtisation de la premiere
phase est prevu au mois de novembre, compte tenu de la non disponibilite des femmes (de juin
I septembre, periode des grands travaux champetres). Cette premibre phase concernera 1.170
femmes dont 195 des comites de groupements villageois. Ces 1.170 femmes sont issues de

centres d'alphabetisation (15 cases-foyers et 75 abris amenages par les groupements villageois)
repartis entre les cinq regions;
9.           Suivi et fvaluation. Le suivi de l'action d'alphabetisation est assure par les monitrices
d'economie familiale qui ont ete formees a cet effet. A l'occasion de chaque visite periodique du centre,
elles relevent les information consignees par les alphabetisatrices sur les instruments d'evaluation. GrAce
a ces instruments, il est possible I tout moment de: (i) determiner le niveau des connaissances des
apprenantes; (ii) examiner les applications pratiques de l'alphabetisation au sein des activites du
groupement; et (iii) inventorier les moyens fournis pour le programme et les modalites d'organisation et
de gestion adoptees dans le village.
10.          Les programmes seront adaptes aux conditions et interets specifiques des femmes et du
projet (sante maternelle et infantile, planification familiale, problemes de population),et k la specialisation
de chaque groupement/union (gestion et entretien de la case-foyer, gestion d'un equipement, gestion de
petits projets). Le materiel pedagogique sera realise par des specialistes (DAEB ou autres organismes
competents) sous la supervision de l'UCP. Le materiel de qualit6 dejk mis au point par le projet
'Promotion Economique des Femmes" (PEF) et par d'autres projets similaires pourra ete utilise apres
un minimum de modifications.
Methodes de formation
I1.          Habituellement, le programme d'alphabetisation en langue nationale est dispense en deux
phases de neuf mois chacune:
(i)    une phase d'acquisition des mecanismes de la lecture, de l'ecriture et du calcul; et
(ii)   une phase d'approfondissement des connaissances qui assure au neo-alphabete un niveau
lui permettant d'interpreter des testes mis I sa disposition, de traduire sa propre pens6e
par ecrit et de resoudre certains petits problemes relatifs I sa vie quotidienne.
C'est apres ces deux phases que le n6o-alphabete entreprendra des activit6s de post-alphabMtisation.
12.          Comme on peut le voir, une telle formation est longue. En raison de sa duree, elle
favorise souvent chez les apprenantes le d6couragement, l'absent6isme puis les abandons. On rencontre
parfois les m8mes difficultes au niveau de l'alphab6tiseur.
13.          C'est compte tenu de ces problemes qu'il a et6 decide, au niveau du programme, I d6faut
d'une approche de formation intensive en 60 jours, au coOt tres elev6, d'entreprendre une formation
etalee, s'etendant sur deux periodes relativement courtes de six mois chacune, suivies d'activites de post-
alphabetisation. En plus de cette approche, le programme d'alphabetisation fonctionnelle du programme
"Promotion de la Femme dans le Developpement" applique une strategie selective car il ne s'adresse
qu'aux femmes des unions locales et des groupements membres des comites de gestion des cases-foyers
ou des equipement (moulins I mil, decortiqueuses, equipements hydrauliques, etc.).
14.          Le cours d'alphabetisation fonctionnelle comprend trois seances, qui sont:
(a)    une causerie - prise de conscience, appele seance d'animation axEe soit sur un sujet de formation
technique, soit sur un sujet de formation socio-conomique ou socio-sanitaire. Cette seance
s'appuie sur une affiche probleme I defaut d'une situation reelle;



- 66 -
ANEXE 3-2
Page 4 sur 8
(b)    une seance de lecture-ecriture qui part de I'analyse d'une phrase cle tiree de la s6ance
d'animation; et
(c)    une seance de calcul decoulant soit d'un seance de formation technique, soit d'une seance de
formation socio-economique ou socio-sanitaire.
15.          Chaque cours prend trois heures, de 15 heures I 18 heures. II est pr6vu quatre cours par
semaine, soit 12 heures. L'ensemble du programme est dispense en 600 heures, soit six mois, en deux
phases suivies d'activites de post-alphabetisation pendant la 3e et 4e annee. Cette methode de formation
ne regroupe que 13 membres de comite de gestion. La selection de ces membres repond aux criteres
suivants: (i) etre volontaire et disponible; (ii) age de 20 a 45 ans, pour des raisons de vision, d'audition
et d'assimilation; (iii) etre dynamique; (iv) etre sedentaire; (v) non marginal; et (vi) prOt I reinvestir au
profil de la communaute.
La Dost-alDhabdtisation
16.          Le concept de post-alphabetisation est ne de plusieurs constatations. En effet, il ne sert
I rien d'avoir appris I lire, I ecrire et I compter aux membres des comites de gestion des groupements
feminins si ces connaissances ne trouvent pas d'application quotidienne et concrete, et si les femmes
nouvellement alphabetisees ne beneficient d'aucune possibilite d'assumer des responsabilites dans leur
groupement et dans leur communaute.  L'acquisition de ce nouveau pouvoir d'expression et de
communication doit Otre soutenue et renforcee par la production de livres, de journaux et par la creation
de centres de lecture adaptes I leurs besoins et I leurs capacites. La formation d'ecrivains locaux en
langues nationales, de communicatrices rurales et de bibliothecaires rurales et l'implantation au niveau
de chaque case-foyer d'une bibliotheque contribueront a creer un environnement lettre favorable I une
meilleure gestion, par les femmes, des cases-foyers, des moulins et des projets d'accompagnement. Par
ces activites de formation visant le transfort aux femmes de nouvelles competences, Ia post-alphabetisation
se presente de ce fait comme un processus de consolidation et de perfectionnement des connaissances ddj&
apprises en vue d'une meilleure mattrise de 1'environnement et une transformation qualitative du milieu.
2.    L'Extension des Cases-Foyers
17.          Sept cases-foyers pilotes sont deja operationnelles au Senegal dans le cadre des projets
PSFP (USAID) et PEF. Au titre de la presente sous-composante il est prevu un appui I la construction
et a i'equipement de 45 nouvelles unites.
Objectif des cases-foyers
18.          Pour l'ensemble des femmes, la case-foyer repond I un besoin longtemps ressenti d'avoir
un lieu precis et fixe de regroupement, de discussion, d'echanges d'iddes, de formation et
d'apprentissage. Son objectif est donc de servir de lieu privilegie d'information, de formation,
d'echanges et d'activites pour les unions locales feminines. II est prevu de construire une case-foyer par
arrondissement dans les cinq regions d'intervention du programme. L'Agence d'execution des travaux
d'inter8t public contre le sous emploi (AGETIP) pourrait agir comme agence d'execution pour la
construction des cases-foyers. Dans ce cas-la, un protocole d'accord serait elabore, pendant la periode
de demarrage du programme, entre I'AGETIP et l'Unite de Soutien de la Composante (USC) precisant
les termes de 1'entente. La construction de la case sera entierement prise en charge par le programme.

L'installation des infrastructures sanitaires, du toit, de la terrasse et de la cloture sera assuree par l'Union
locale avec le concours de la communaute villageoise.
19.          Le site d'implantation devra etre un lieu polorisateur de plusieurs groupements, I
proximite d'un point d'eau afin de reduire les cocats d'installation de l'eau et faciliter la tenue de plusieurs
activites.
Gestion des cases-foyers
20.          Cette gestion sera assuree par un comite de gestion elu parmi les femmes membres des
unions locales. I1 aura plus particulibrement pour responsabilites: (i) l'organisation et la programmation
des activites, leur suivi et leur evaluation; (ii) 1'entretien et la reparation de la case-foyer ('insuffisance
de la maintenance des infrastructures est l'un des problbmes des cases-foyers pilotes); (iii) la recherche
du financement des activites; et (iv) 1'expansion de la case-foyer.
21.          Le programme d'alphabetisation fonctionnelle des membres des comites de gestion sera
en partie axe sur les problemes de gestion et sur la preparation de projets donnant lieu a la formation de
revenus. Pour le demarrage de ces projets il pourrait etre fait appel I un financement de l'IDA dans le
cadre du projet "Petites Operations Rurales" dont une partie des fonds est reservee I l'intention des
groupements feminins.
3.    Emuiiements pour I'allEement des trairaux d=mestIgu
22.          Cette sous-composante doit fournir a 375 groupements de femmes certains equipements
specialises destines avant tout I reduire la penibilite des thches domestiques et k permettre aux femmes
de mieux maitriser leur temps.
Choix des Equipements
23.          II sera tenu compte de lexperience acquise dans ce domaine par le PEF et par certaines
autres ONG ayant les memes objectifs, et qui disposent deja d'un reseau confirme de ressources humaines
et materielles pour assister k la mise en place des equipements aupres des groupements. Une
collaboration devra s'etablir pour ce qui est du choix des fournisseurs (moteurs et pieces de rechange),
des artisans locaux (fabrication des carcasses des equipements), des mecaniciens locaux (suivi technique
des equipements) et pour la formation de nouveaux mecaniciens et de meunieres. En ce qui concerne les
equipements hydrauliques, le projet pourra collaborer avec deux ONG qui ont dejk developpe une
expertise dans la fabrication et l'installation de pompes manuelles, soit le CAD et l'AFATEC; une etude
sera menee dans la phase de demarrage du programme afin de bien connattre, identfifier et surtout
prevenir tous les problemes inherents I l'installation des equipements hydrauliques.
24.          Le choix de l'equipement sera fonction des resultats d'une etude prealable qui identifiera
la technologie la plus appropriee (selon la nature et l'importance de la production agricole), le site
d'implantation, les ressources humaines et la capacite du milieu I pouvoir rentabiliser l'equipement. Pour
80%, les equipements seront constitues de materiel de traitement des produits agricoles (moulins I mil,
decortiqueuses, moulins a pate d'arachide, etc.) et pour 20% d'equipements hydrauliques notamment de
pompes manuelles.

ANNEXE 3-2
Page 6 sur 8
Gestion et Financement des &quipements
25.          Pour favoriser une meilleure prise en charge et la responsabilisation necessaire k une
bonne gestion, les equipements agricoles ne seront pas distribues totalement gratuitement aux
groupements. lls seront fournis en partie sous forme de subvention (50%) et en partie sous forme de
"credit" (50%).
26.          Dans les faits il ne s'agira pas d'un veritable credit car il n'y aura pas transfert de fonds
entre le UCP et les groupements concernes. Les equipements seront acquis par le UCP qui les fera livrer
aux beneficiaires. Ces derniers devront s'engager a financer 50% des costs de leurs equipements
respectifs; a cet effet ils ouvriront un compte dans une institution bancaire qu'ils approvisionneront
mensuellement d'un montant donne jusqu'au remboursement total du credit. Lorsque le remboursement
du credit sera arrive h terme, ces sommes ainsi degagees constitueront le fonds de roulement pour le
financemw.i d'activites economiques ou pour l'entretien de l'equipement. lt serait nEcessaire que les
groupemnts beneficiaires remplissent certains critbres de qualification pour demontrer leur capacite
d'operer et maintenir 1'equipement, y compris l'organisation d'un comite de gestion pour superviser
l'utilisation de l'equipement ainsi que l'etablissement des normes de maintenance et de recouvrement des
colits. Les groupements beneficiant des pompes hydrauliques manuels ne seraient obliges de repayer
aucune partie de l'investissement; ils seraient, pourtant, soumis aux memes critbres de qualification, y
compris la definition d'un plan de maintenance de l'equipement.
27.          Les gestionnaires et utilisatrices des equipements seront sensibilisees et form6es I un
systeme de gestion simple et facilement maitrisable. Les revenus mensuels gen6res par les equipements
seront repartis ainsi: 1/4 pour le fonds d'amortissement, 1/4 pour les charges de fonctionnement, 114
pour le salaires (meunibre), et 1/4 pour le remboursement du credit. Lorsque le fonds d'amortissement
atteindra 500.000 FCFA, la repartition pourra se faire I raison de 1/8 I l'amortissement et 1/8 I
l'epargne.
Collaboration avec une institution bancaire
23.          Pour toutes les questions relatives aux credits accordes, une institution bancaire sera
choisie qui facilitera l'ouverture de tout compte utile aux groupements en permettant l'ouverture
simultanee de deux comptes lies: un compte d'operations courantes et un compte d'epargne qui recevra
les remboursements mensuels des credits et dont les depots resteront bloques jusqu'au remboursement
total du credit. Cette institution bancaire s'engagera par ailleurs a participer a la formation prealable du
personnel d'encadrement du programme charge du suivi des groupements. La CNE (caisse nationale
d'epargne) avait ddj& ete choisie comme institution partenaire parce qu'elle est la plus accessible en terme
de representation territoriale pour les groupements de femmes: 28 bureaux departementaux et 125 bureaux
de poste sur 1'ensemble du territoire. La CNE avait egalement ete choisie I cause de t'expertise
developpee avec les groupements feminins dans le cadre du projet "Promotion economique des
groupements de femmes"; I cet effet, un poste de responsable des groupements feminins avait fte cr66
en juillet 1988 a la CNE, et certains documents de formation avaient ete elaboreos, tel: organisation et
suivi des comptes d'epargne des groupements fEminins juillet 1988. Mais en raison de certaines
difficultes que rencontrent actuellement les groupements concernes I effectuer des retraits ou autres types
d'operations, il serait souhaitable de re-evaluer cette decision. Ainsi de nouveaux contacts seront
egalement pris avec la CNCA.

CritOres d'Eligibilitd des Groupements Beneficiaires
29.          Les groupements qui prdsentent des demandes seront selectionnees en fonction des crittres
suivantes:
-     l'importance du village - 500 habitants au minimum dans un rayon de 3km et une
production agricole suffisante
-     leur adhesion I la politique d'alphabetisation fonctionnelle
-     leur organigramme
-     leur cohesion, leur dynamisme, leur capacite d'organisation des activitds et de
mobilisation des moyens
-     leur capacite de gestion des fonds
-     le choix d'une technologie appropriee aux conditions locales (dtudes sur l'environnement
et la situation economique du village)
-     la construction d'abris pour les equipements
Tous les groupements beneficiaires devront creer un comite responsable de la gestion de l'Equipement.
Les dix femmes membres du comite qui seront selectionnees devront repondre aux criteres suivants: (i)
8tre suffisamment actives et dynamiques au sein du groupement; (ii) avoir des capacites de leadership;
(iii) avoir un intdr8t marque et une disponibilite rdelle pour la gestion d'un equipement collectif; et (iv)
participer a un programme d'alphabetisation qui s'etendra sur une periode de six mois. Ces critbres de
sElection, les actions de formation et la responsabilisation entiere des femmes devraient contribuer I
l'atteinte des objectifs de cette composante.
4.    Le Renforcement institutionnel du Ministere Delgue I I_u Condition de Ia
Femme et de I'Enfant (MCFEI
30.          Une stratEgie I long terme de promotion de la femme est en cours de pr6paration par le
Ministere ddlegue charge de la condition de la femme et de l'enfant, avec l'assistance de l'IDA
(financement SPPF et etudes sectorielles) et d'autres bailleurs de fonds. Pour contribuer & cette exercice
et pour appuyer le developpement continu des approches operationnelles pratiques visant la promotion
de la femme dans le developpement, le MCFE sera charge du suivi et de l'evaluation des activites I cet
egard menees dans le cadre du projet PDRH. Le Ministere sera egalement responsable de l'evaluation
de l'impact de tous les programmes visant l'amelioration du statut de la femme et leur acces aux
opportunites economiques. En dernier lieu, il examinera le contenu des curricula destines aux monitrices
des activites en vue de les adapter k leur nouveau rBle dans la mise en oeuvre de la stratEgie k long terme.
Pour augmenter le niveau de connaissance des rOles et des problemes de la femme, le MCFE sera charge
de l'execution de certaines activites de sensibilisation et de promotion I travers les mass media ainsi
qu'une serie de seminaires. Le projet apportera un appui au MCFE dans ses activites de planning
strategique, suivi et evaluation, et sensibilisation et financera: les services de specialistes pour les
activites de suivi et evaluation (dix mois international), la formation du personnel du MCFE, les
seminaires aux niveaux national et regional, la production et la dissemination des materiels mass media,
les cotits recurrents, et l'equipement et le mobilier de bureau pour le MCFE.

REPUBLIE DU SENEGAL
PROJET DE DEVELOPPEMENT DES RESSOURCES HUMAINES
Population et Sante
Sensibilisation des Jeunes par l'Education a la Vie Familiale
et la Promotion d'Activites Participatives des Associations
1.    RuciMund
1.           La Declaration de politique de population du Senegal consacre une place importante I la
promotion des jeunes du fait de son role et leurs effets dans la dynamique de ce secteur. Le Senegal
compte actuellement 7 millions d'habitants dont 53 % de jeunes de moins de 21 ans. Ce poids
ddmographique est extr8mement important et constitue une preoccupation majeure de la population adulte
et du Gouvernement. Beaucoup de jeunes adolescents, du fait des difficultes rencontrees, ne reussissent
pas I l'Age adulte, les conditions necessaires a leur epanouissement mental et physique, moral et materiel.
2.           Les enqu8tes realis&es au SEnEgal durant l'annde internationale de la jeunesse ont montre
chez les jeunes des preoccupations prioritaires de l'emploi, de la formation, de la sante, de la
communication, de l'epanouissement par le sport, le loisir et les activitds socio-culturelles.
3.           Parmi les mesures contenues dans la Declaration de politique de population, il est prevu
pour la promotion des jeunes de favoriser les actions suivantes:
-     L'integration dans la formation scolaire et extra-scolaire des jeunes d'elements
d'education I la vie familiale (EVF) pour les preparer a une conduite responsable a P'age
adulte.
-     Le soutien I l'organisation des jeunes capable de leur offrir des perspectives de
mobilisation, de concertation et de loisirs qui s'inscrivent dans le cadre de leur
epanouissement et de leur participation au developpement national.
-     La mise en oeuvre de programme preparant les jeunes a leur insertion I la vie
professionnelle.
-     La sensibilisation des jeunes sur les risques lies a la sexualite et la maternite precoce.
-     L'amelioration des infrastructures sanitaires, socio-educatives et socio-culturelles pour
favoriser leur epanouissement.
-     L'elaboration d'une documentation et de materiaux appropries pour l'information et
l'education des jeunes sur les problbmes lies I l'espacement des naissances et tous les
autres volets de la politique de population.

2.    PROBLEME EI ENJU
4.           Le taux de scolarisation au Senegal atteint seulement 53,6 % avec une deperdition scolaire
qui reste tres elevee comme en atteste les statistiques suivantes:
-     81,7 % a l'entree en 6eme
-     48,3 % au BFEM (Brevet de fin d'etudes moyennes)
-     69,67 % I la premiere partie du Baccalaureat
-     43,37 % k la deuxieme partie du Baccalaur6at.
Ce taux faible de scolarisation et cette forte deperdition permettent d'apprecier la proportion de jeunes
hors du cadre scolaire ot constituant souvent les cibles les plus exposees aux fleaux sociaux.
5.           Des enquetes durant l'annee internationale de la jeunesse ont montre un developpement
des fidaux tels que la toxicomanie, la ddlinquance, la prostitution et ses consequences mais aussi lo
desarroi devant la dispersion des valeurs traditionnelles et de nombreux cas de grossesses precoces et non
ddsir6es.
6.           Les structures d'accueil pour l'organisation des activites socio-4ducatives sont tres limitees
en nombre et celles qui existent sont peu fonctionnelles du fait d'une absence d'entretien et de
participations effectives des jeunes a leur gestion. Les services traditionnels de l'administration charges
de leur encadrement no presentent pas de programmes soutenus et pertinents pouvant mobiliser les jeunes
dans ces structures. Les actions d'information, de communication et d'education envers les jeunes
s'arretent aux seules s6ances theoriques de seminaires. Les thbmes abordes ne sont souvent pas le resultat
de recherche participative des groupes-cibles pour repondre k leurs besoins et pourtant de nombreux
travaux sont effectues dans ce domaine par des organes de recherche comme l'IFAN et le BNR et
quelques ONG.
3.    OB.ITECmS
7.           Le programme de promotion des jeunes dans le cadre du PDRH contribue a l'application
des mesures prevues par la politique de population adoptee par le Gouvernement. n1 s'agit notamment:
faire prendre conscience aux jeunes non scolarises, descolarises et l'ensemble des jeunes
du secteur associatif, en vue de les preparer I une conduite responsable I l'age adulte,
en particulier en matibre de fdcondite;
de soutenir les organisations de jeunes capables d'offrir des perspectives de mobiisation,
de concertation et de loisirs qui s'inscrivent dans le cadre de leur epanouissement;
d'am0liorer les infrastructures socio-educatives et socio-culturelles destinees a favoriser
cet epanouissement.
8.           Le PDRH appuiera le Ministbre de la Jeunesse et des Sports (MJS) dans le renforcement
de sa capacite de mise en oeuvre d'un programme d'information, de communication et d'education (IEC)
en particulier dans le domaine de l'education a la vie familiale. Environ 86 agents du MJS et d'autres
organismes menant une action similaire dans les quatre r6gions de Dakar, Thibs, Kaolack et St-Louis
couvertes par le programme, auront renforce leurs connaissances et competences dans les contenus de



- 73 -
ANNEXE 3-3
Page 3 sur 6
I'EVF et les techniques de communication afin qu'ils realisent les actions d'IEC et de conseils des jeunes
qu'ils encadrent.
9.           Le PDRH soutiendra les actions d'information, de sensibilisation et d'education des
membres des 54 associations de jeunes selectionnes dans les regions couvertes par le programme afin de
les rendre responsables de leur sante et fecondite et reduire, par consequent le nombre de grossesses
precoces, avortements provoques et maladies sexuellement transmissibles (MST). La repartition regionale
de ces associations est la suivante: Dakar: 27, Thies: 7, Kaolack: 12, St-Louis: 12.
10.          Les structures d'accueil des activites de jeunesse dans les regions du programme seront
renovees par la restauration de 12 Centres departementaux d'Education populaire et sportive (CDEPS),
26 Foyers de jeunes, l'amenagement d'aires de jeux pour les associations de jeunes, la realisation
d'investissements humains dans les domaines du nettoiement, du reboisement, etc... des quartiers, grace
a des activites participatives et volontaires des associations et ONG participant au programme educatif;
ces travaux de restauration et d'amenagement seront organises quand cela est approprie, sous forme
d'ateliers de formation artisanale. Dans le prolongement de cette formation, il sera suscite aupres des
groupements de jeunes ayant participe au programme d'EVF d'initier des idees de projets generateurs de
revenus dans le secteur informel. Des primes d'incitation leurs seront allouees pour le lancement de ces
projets. Les regions sont decoupees en departements qui abritent chacun un CDEPS qui est le service
administratif local regroupant le personnel technique du MIS. Autour d'un CDEPS gravite un reseau de
foyers de jeunes faisant office de sieges des associations de jeunes. Le nombre de foyers varie d'un
departement I l'autre selon le dynamisme du mouvement associati
11.          La strategie de mise en oeuvre de cette composante s'articulera autour de deux types
d'activites:
(a)    un programme IEC en matibre de vie familiale et plus g6ndralement sur tout ce qui
touche la population;
(b)    un soutien aux activites participatives initiees par les associations de jeunes et des
organisations non gouvemementales (ONG) menant des actions similaires y compris la
rehabilitation des CDEPS et les foyers de jeunes.
II s'agit de profiter de l'existence des nombreuses organisations ou associations qui rassemblent la
jeunesse en dehors du systbme scolaire pour vEhiculer les messages educatifs a travers une approche IEC.
12.          Les actions au point (b) ont un role de renforcement du volet (a) qui constitue I'element
de base du programme. Ce volet (a) commencera avant ces actions et se poursuivra tout au long du
programme; il sera exEcutE en etroite collaboration avec le Ministere de la Sante Publique et de l'Action
Sociale (MSPAS) dont les competences seront utilisees principalement dans la definition des contenus de
l'EVF et la formation des formateurs. Pour cela, le service de l'Education pour la Sante (EPS) du
MSPAS, qui beneficiera d'un soutien du PDRH dans le cadre de la composante SMI/PF, sera mis I
contribution.

13.          Les contenus des thbmes de l'information, I'education et la sensibilisation des groupes-
cibles vont ressortir des recommandations d'un comite interministeriel d'orientation, form6 de specialistes
et techniciens en la matibre (cf. para. 23) et des besoins ressentis comme prioritaires par les jeunes et
signales par une recherche. Cette recberche sera congue de fagon a completer les donnees obtenues par
les enqu6tes menees au Senegal conjointement par l'IFAN et le BNR, sur la fecondite des adolescents et
les travaux futurs du service EPS.
14.          Le programme se concentrera dans les zones peri-urbaines des grandes villes senegalaises.
Dans sa premibre phase, il couvrira les quatre regions de Dakar, Thibs, Kaolack et St-Louis pour
s'etendre progressivement I l'ensemble des grandes viles du pays dans les cinq annees I venir au fur et
I mesure que le financement est mobilise. Les regions ont ete choisies sur la base des enquetes
demographiques et de sante. La priorite a ete egalement donnee aux regions dynamiques du point de vue
des mouvements associatifs, de l'existence des services PF et leur accessibilitd. Le Canada et la France
pourraient participer a ce programme qui s'elhve k environ deux millions de dollars E.U. Le FNUAP
contribue pour 630.000 dollars E.U. pour voie d'un financement parallble (Projet Education a la Vie
Familiale); ce montant n'est pas inclus dans le coCit du projet.
15.          Parmi lea critbres de selection des associations de jeunes, il sera retenu:
-     1'existence d'une structure organisationnelle;
-     le type de mandat de l'association;
-     la capacite de mobiliser des ressources humaines et financibres meme modestes;
-     I'adhdsion au programme EVF;
-     la capacite de concevoir des programmes et le dynamisme pour les mener k bout.
Les associations selectionnees designeront des membres-leaders qui suivront les seminaires de formation
et recevront du materiel pour l'animation de leur groupe. Dans les zones du programme, I'ASBEF
beneficiera du support de la composante dans ses activites d'EVF et ses programmes d'activites
participatives.
16.          Afin de mobiliser la participation volontaire des jeunes a des occupations saines et
socialement utiles et mettre en pratique un certain nombre de messages educatifs concernant
l'environnement, I'auto-prise en charge, les associations bdneficiant du programme d'EVF, choisiront
d'entreprendre des actions d'amelioration de leur cadre de vie. Le Ministere de la Jeunesse et des Sports
leur offrira la possibilite de contribuer avec leurs competences et leur travail aux activites suivantes:
-     restauration et decoration des CDEPS et autres locaux socio-educatifs sous forme
d'ateliers de formation artisanale (magonnerie, electricite, plomberie, menuiserie,
peinture);
-     assainissement et hygiene des quartiers (evacuation et destruction des ordures, nettoiemen.
des locaux publics, remblaiement des routes, evacuation de rigoles et caniveaux);
-     amenagement des aires sportives;
-     reboisement;
-     autres activites socialement utiles.
17.          Parmi ces activites participatives, celles qui seront menees sous forme d'atelier de

formation artisanale beneficieront de l'appui ponctuel de personnel specialise fourni par le MIS et
disponible au riveau national ou regional ou des consultants ayant une competence dans le type de
formation prevue.
18.          Chaque association interessee s'engagera sur une base contractuelle, speciflant: I'activite
I accomplir; I'equipement necessaire; la maniere et le rythme auxquels l'activite sera executee; le budget
indiquant les apports du MJS et les apports de l'association. Ce document de contrat sera disponible au
demarrage du programme.
19.          Le MJS assurera la mise en route et la supervision de ce volet en particulier, il aura en
charge de:
-     l'identification des associations de jeunes interesses;
-     I'assistance I la mise en forme du document contractuel;
-     le contrOle de l'execution;
-     le suivi de l'octroi des apports des deux parties;
-     I'evaluation finale de l'a-tivite executee.
5.  ORGANISATION ET EXECUTION rU PROGRAMME ET DIIONA
20.          L'organisme de mise en oeuvre du programme est le Ministbre de la Jeunesse, au sein
duquel la Direction de la Jeunesse et des activites socio-educatives sera responsable de son execution.
II sera cree, en collaboration avec le BIT/FNUAP une unite de gestion du projet au niveau de cette
Direction incluant un technicien du MSPAS. Compte tenu de l'implication du MSPAS au volet
IEC/EVF, i sera egalement constitue un comite interministeriel d'orientation des actions jeunes-
population regroupant les representants des services et ONG concernes. Ce comite %"'ra pour tAche entre
autres de deflnir le contenu des themes, d'orienter les objectifs du programme et de tomer son avis sur
les programmes annuels I mettre en oeuvre.
21.          L'execution du programme par la Direction de la Jeunesse sera assuree selon l'approche
decrite ci-dessus dans la strategie. Au niveau regional et departemental, le cher de service regional du
MJS et les directeurs de CDEPS qui sont des inspecteurs d'education populaire et sportive auront la

REPUBLIOUE DU SENEGAL
PROJET DE DEVELOPPEMENT DES RESSOURCES HUMAINES
Population et Sante
Rdorganisation du Systbme des Districts sanitaires
1.           La reorganisation des services de sante au niveau des districts sanitaires (DS) est la piece
maftresse du programme de reforme du secteur de la sante et est une condition indispensable a
l'amelioration de la qualite et de l'accessibilite des soins de sante primaire.    Le principe fondainental
de cette reorganisation est d'assurer une couverture sanitaire totale et equitable de l'ensemble de la
population du Senegal, ce qui exige notamment que soit amelioree la qualite de la planification sanitaire
nationale. Le district sanitaire a ete retenu comme base de cette planification. II est donc necessaire de
dfinir avec precision le district et les structures primaires - postes de sante (PS) et centres de sante (CS) -
qu'il coiffe, ainsi que les zones de responsabilit6 respectives et les taches specifiques I chaque Echelon.
II conviendra ensuite d'identifier les ressources necessaires et de fixer les normes de personnel.
Dfinitions et Attributions
2.           Le district sanitaire est un ensemble operationnel qui couvre une population de 150,000
a 300,000 habitants environ et qui regroupe de 15 a 25 PS articules autour d'un echelon de reference ou
de recours, le CS (ou eventuellement un hBpital regional - HR). Le district est aussi un ensemble
administratif en le sens qu'il est dirige par une equipe unique, dite 6quipe de district.
3.           Le nouveau decoupage prevoit un total de 45 districts, choisis sur la base de criteres
d'accessibilite des CS aux patients referes par les PS, et d'accessibilite des PS a la supervision par
l'equipe des districts (voir Appendice 1). L'accroissement de la population pour la pdriode 90-95 a ete
pris en consideration. La creation de nouveaux districts pourrait 8tre envisagee a l'issue de cette periode
selon que de besoin. Les PS, CS et HR doivent offrir un minimum de prestations, appele par convention
"paquet minimum d'activite", identique pour chaque classe de structure. Ce n'est que lorsque ces
prestations sont offertes en quantit6 et qualite suffisantes, qu'une structure faut developper des fonctions
additionnelles.
4.           Pour aboutir a l'implantation des activites dans les CS et les PS, et pour assurer leur
qualite et leur utilisation, une decentralisation de la decision au niveau du district s'im.pose aussi bien que
celle de la gestion des budgets.
5.           Chaque district est dote d'une equipe cadre qui, en plus des activitEs purement cliniques
au CS et de la supervision des PS, doit gerer les ressources (personnel, mEdicaments, budget, savoir
faire,...). Elle est constitude au min.mum de deux m6decins (un medecin-chef de district (MCD) et un
deuxieme mddecin de district) avec une equipe de quatre superviseurs des .'SP, pharnmacien, specialiste
SMI/PF et EPS, qui peuvent etre des infirmiers d'etat (JE) avec anciennete et brevet du centre de

formation CESSI, soutenus par une equipe consistant en un gestionnaire, un secretaire et un chauffeur.
Ce gestionnaire/comptable sera charge de la comptabilite globale au niveau du district aussi bien qu'au
niveau du CS. II est egalement charge de preparer le plan de developpement du district sanitaire (PDDS).

6.           Le Centre de Sante a pour vocation de devenir un echelon de reference pour les PS. Les
limites geographiques de la zone de responsabilite de CS devront etre precisees compte tenu des
distances, de la population et de sa densite, ce qui suppose un recensement sanitaire et une inscription
individuelles au CS. Dans les capitales regionales, les hOpitaux regionaux (HR) jouent le role de CS pour
la population y residant. nl n'y a pas donc de besoin d'un CS separe dans les capitales regionales, I
l'exception de Dakar oh la taille de la population exige plusieurs CS. Les CS des capitales rdgionales,
et ceux qui ne sont pas destines I devenir une structure de reference selon le plan de couverture des
districts doivent k terme se transformer en PS.
7.           Le paquet minimum d'activite du CS couvre l'hospitalisation (avec une capacite de 100
a 150 lits), la consultation de recours par un medecin, des travaux de laboratoire et de radiographie, la
prise en charge des urgences medico-chirurgicales et la recuperation nutritionnelle. Ses activites
logistiques et gestionnaires concernent la gestion financieres et pharmaceutiques, l'offre de medicaments
essentiels, l'information et l'evaluation sanitaires.
8.           n est prevu un personnel de 29 personnes comprenant: les 2 mEdecins citEs ci-dessous;
14 param6dicaux, soit 4 SF et 10 IE/AS (on admet une certaine flexibilite entre les deux profils et que
les AS peuvent 8tre recycles en IE s'il y a des AS en exces); 10 sp6cialists, soit 1 charge de la
pharmacie (qui devrait 8tre un AS), 3 techniciens (hygiene, assainissement, ondontologie), 3 aide-
infirmiers et 3 matrones; et 3 administratif, dont 1 comptable, 1 billeteur, I secretaire, et 1 chauffeur.
On notera que la presence du troisieme m6decin est necessaire quand les postes I surveiller fonctionnent
a plein et la population depasse 250.000.
Le Poste de Sante (PS)
9.           Le Poste de Sante a une zone de responsabilite de l'ordre de 10,000 habitants qui sera
decoupee en 8 socio-secteurs preventifs de taille approximativement egale. Le PS est le lieu de premier
contact entre la population et le service de sante, mais aussi le lieu de stockage de la memoire clinique
et sociologique des patients. Son paquet minimum d'activite comprend la consultation curative primaire,
la prise en charge des malades chroniques (tuberculeux, lepreux...), la consultation prenatale, la
consultation des nourrissons sains, le planning familial, la recuperation nutritionneile. L'education
sanitaire n'est pas entibre, mais une composante n6cessaire a toutes les autres activites. Le PS assume
en outre des taches logistiques et gestionnaires relatives I la participation, la gestion financiere et
pharmaceutique et l'offre de medicaments essentiels, 1'enregistrement des individus et la tenue de dossiers
familiaux, les tournees de village ou de quartier, la tenue I jour des donnees sanitaires...
10.          Le personnel d'un PS comprend: un jparamedica, pour etre chef de poste (ICP), soit un
IE, une SF ou un AS avec une formation adequate pour les preparer I des fonctions qui ne lour ont pas
ete enseignees dans les ecoles professionnelles de sante; et des agents de soutien. Ces derniers seront

Page 3 sur 5
payes par les associations de sante; le minimum est d'avoir un billeteur-secr6taire pour assurer le
paiement des tarifs de visites, plus de 1 k 2 agents(s) villageois sanitaire(s)-manoeuvres en fonction du
taux d'utilisation du poste.
11.          Lorsque le paquet minimum  d'activite prevu pour un PS est realise, et que la
communication avec la population est satisfaisante, les activites peuvent etre dtendues a de nouveaux
domaines, comme indique ci-apres:
(a)    La promotion sanitaire qui inclut la promotion nutritionnelle, I'adduction d'eau, et
I'assainissement du milieu (dont l'evacuation des dechets solides). Comme la realisation de ces
programmes requiert des ressources superieurs I celles des services de sante, la promotion
sanitaire a pour objet principal l'information reciproque de la population, generalement a
l'initiative de personnalites charismatiques et sont des lors ephemeres. Parce qu'elle exige de la
main d'oeuvre et des changements de comportement, la promotion sanitaire tend generalement
I etre delaissee au-dela d'une phase initiale d'engouement lorsque l'activite ne repond pas a un
besoin ressenti par la communaute.
(b)    Les sous-programmes repr6sentent des ajouts aux activites du paquet minimum, effectu6s selon
les possibilites nouvelles de financement. Ils doivent repondre k l'identification de problbmes
locaux par les professionnels de la sante et/ou a la demande de la population. Exemples:
nivaquinisation des femmes enceintes, deparasitation semestrielle des moins de trois ans,
programme de prise en charge des hypertendus, etc.
(c)    Les PMI mobiles concretisent la prise en charge des populations de la zone de responsabilit6 qui
habitent loin du PS par des visites periodiques destin6es a offrir des soins preventifs, I superviser
I'ASC, et I repondre aux problbmes souleves par la population.
(d)    Les ASC permettent a des populations enclavdes, trop petites pour justifier la cr6ation d'une
infrastructure sanitaire nouvelle, d'entrer en contact avec un CS. Les ASC doivent servir de
relais aux activites des CS et offrir des soins elementaires aux malades.
Les Hopitaux Regionaux
12.          Les hOpitaux regionaux sont les premiers echelons du service de sante ob I'on trouve des
specialistes, parmi lesquels il y a, au minimum, un chirurgien, un gynecologue, un ORL, un p6diatre,
un ophtalmologue et un dentiste. Dans la mesure ou les HR servent comme deuxibme niveau de
reference (au dessus du CS), ils se trouvent au-dela de la structure du district sanitaire; ceci I l'exception
du district desservant la population residente de la capitale rdgionale pour lequel le HR joue le r6le de
CS
La Region Medicale
13.          Fonction de la RM. La planification est un processus dont les pOles principaux sont le
sous-district et le niveau central du MSP. Les regions medicales ont un rOle intermediaire. Elles doivent:



- 80 -
ANNEXIE 3-4
Page 4 sur 5
-contr6ler 1'adequation des PDDS avec les normes et la politique nationale, et verifier
leur qualite technique;
-superviser techniquement leur conception et leur mise en application;
-synthetiser les plans de districts;
-jouer un role modu!ateur dans les allocations de ressources.
Les MCR doivent animer les districts, c'est-a-dire les encadrer techniquement et soutenir
psychologiquement les MSD, dont les succes doivent etre reconnus et les dchecs, corriges. II est donc
souhaitable que les MCR soient en possession d'une mattrise en sante publique. Us doivent aussi posseder
une experience et des connaissances significativement superieures I celle des MSD (une condition sine
qua non a l'acceptabilitd d'une telle supervision) car les MCR doivent Wtre capables d'apporter des
reponses pratiques aux problemes que les MSD rencontrent.
14.           Composition de l'equipe de la RM. Le personnel des RM doit 8tre compose de l'equipe
suivante:
(a)    un groupe de coordination doit regrouper le MCR, le medecin-chef de l'HR, le directeur
de l'HR, le MGE (adjoint du MCR); un pBle technique regroupant les medecins
specialistes hospitaliers charges d'ameliorer le niveau technique des prestations des MSD
dans le domaine qui est leur (chirurgie, gynecologie, ORL, etc.) doit conseiller le groupe
de coordination de la region medicale dans certains domaines. II est necessaire que les
chirurgiens des hOpitaux regionaux supervisent les MSD en matiere d'activites
chirurgicales. Le personnel specialise de niveau infirmier ou assistant social (es
superviseur des programmes specialises) doit Wre retire progressivement des equipes des
RM et etre affecte I d'autres taches;
'I)    I'equipe administrative de la region mddicale est constitu6e en outre d'un gestionnaire,
d'un adjoint administratif et technique Qe "superviseur des SSP", dont le titre indique mal
les fonctions rdelles) devant etre titulaire d'un diplOme du CESSI, d'un secretaire et d'un
chauffeur; le superviseur regional des SSP ne doit pas personnellement superviser tous
les PS de la region. Le superviseur rdgional des SSP: collecte et synthetise l'information
sanitaire; aide I la redaction des rapports de la region; contribue & l'evaluation des
programmes. II peut donc prelever episodiquement de l'information I l'occasion de
visites dans les PS; et il participe I la formation des infirmiers dans les domaines du
nursing et du travail administratif. Les superviseurs regionaux des SSP ne doivent pas
donner d'injonctions directes aux agents travaillant dans les PS.
Les services specialises
15.          IntEgration Administrative et Operationnelle. Divers services specialises possedent leur
propre infrastructure operationnelle: (e service national de sante maternelle et infantile, le programme
de nutrition et le service national de l'hygiene, en particulier). Ces services ont leurs infrastructures
propres (centres de PMI, centres de nutrition, dispensaires anti-tuberculeux, equipes mobiles lepre, etc.)
et repondent chacun d'une division relativement autonome au niveau de la DHPS.

ANNEXE 34
Page 5 sur 5
16.           La politique sanitaire des ann6es I venir sera caracterisee par une integration
op6rationnelle et administrative progressive de ces entites. Les directions spdcialisees doivent s'eloigner
de la gestion directe des programmes pour se concentrer sur la gestion des recherches et la vulgarisation
des resultats. Les directions specialisees ne peuvent pas superviser directement les PS et CS. Elles ne
s'y presentent que pour collecter l'information utile I la conception des programmes. Les raisons de cette
politique sont les suivants:
(a)    l'integration permet de renforcer techniquement les services polyvalents;
(b)    l'aamlioration de leur technicite accrott leur acceptabiite aupres de la population;
(c)    l'integration des activites dans les PS et dispensaires permet d'y developper une medecine
globale; tous les aspects du patient peuvent alors etre reellement pris en consideration par la
structure;
(d)    le maintien de services verticaux est coGteux en personnel et frais r6currents;
(e)    le superviseurs de programme proliferent, et les injonctions qu'ils donnent aux ICP sont
contradictoires: chacun defend les interets de "son" programme, au detriment de l'equilibre de
l'ensemble.
Cependant, l'integration ne peut pas se faire brutalement. Elle doit au contraire repondre I une strategie
d'extension de la couverture a moyen terme. Toutes les activites ne sont pas bonnes a integrer. Celles
qui ne repondent pas a une demande de la population (comme les activites du service d'hygiene, la
surveillance epid6miologique et l'intervention en cas d'urgence epidemiologique), ainsi que celles qui
requierent des techniques non medicales (comme l'assainissement du milieu, la lutte anti-vectorielle) sont
a exclure du processus d'integration. Cependant l'efficience avec laquelle elles utilisent le personnel doit
etre accrue.
17.           Le service des grandes endemies. Les fonctions d'i service des grandes end6mies doivent
consister en conseil des structures polyvalentes en matiere de lutte contre certaines (Oa tuberculose, la
lepre, la shistosomiase et l'onchocercose). Le services des GE ne peut superviser directement les activites
integrees. Par contre le SGE doit en realiser l'evaluation, afin d'ameliorer la pertinence de ses conseils
aux structures polyvalents. Les fonctions operationnelles du SGE ne disparaissent I l'occasion de leur
integration dans les PS et CS. Cette reflexion vaut pour le PEV: les PS ruraux ne sont pas capables
d'effectuer d'emblee l'ensemble des PMI mobiles requises Oa strategie dite avancee). Les equipes
mobiles du SGE doivent dont temporairement en conserver une partie des responsabilites. Au niveau
regional, on prevoit: le MGE, un technicien du CESSI, un logisticien (un agent sanitaire), une equipe
mobile comprenant un infirmier ou agent sanitaire et un chauffeur ainsi qu'une secretaire.
Les equipes mobiles a prevoir pour les diverses RM sont les suivantes: Dakar:1; Louga:2; Diourbel:1;
Ziguinchor: 1; Kolda:"; Tambacounda:3; Saint-Louis:2; Thies:2; Fatick:2; Kaloach:2.

APPENDICE
Nouveau decoupage en districts
1.           Les districts suivants ont etd definis par le Direction de la Sante Publique. Ils ont ete
discutd avec la mission d'evaluation du PDRH .
2.           Les critbres utilises sont l'accessibilite du CS aux patients referes par les PS et
l'accessibilite des PS a la supervision des membres de l'equipe cadre des districts, une taille de population
de 150.000 a 250.000 habitants, et le respect des limites de departement. L'accroissement de la
population pour la pdriode 90-95 a et6 pris en consideration. La necessite de crder des nouveaux districts
pourrait etre reconsiddre a l'issue de cette periode (en particulier dans la region de Dakar).
3.           Cette planification doit Otre scrupuleusement respectde pour 3 raisons:
1) toute creation de CS nouveau induit des coets rdcurrents eleves (environ 15% de
l'in iestissement soit 67.000.000 FCFA par an) si l'on veut que les infrastructures soient
utilisees de maniere consistante avec ce pour quoi elles ont ete prevues; dans le cas
contraire, les CS fonctionnent au mieux comme de gros dispensaires et l'investissement
est partiellement inutile;
2) les infrastructures existantes ne tournent pas, loin s'en faut, I pleine capacit6; la
priorite est d'obtenir que ces infrastructures soient fonctionnelles, plutOt que d'en creer
de nouvelles;
3) la multiplication des CS compromet le fonctionnement des PS en rdduisant leurs
ressources.

* Le CS d'Oussouye n'existe que pour des raison politico-administratives. En aucun cas, une population
de 35.000 habitants ne pourra financer le fonctionnement d'une structure du second echelon. Le
renforcement de ce CS n'est donc pas prevu.
* L'h6pital d'Ourossougui exigerait de telles sommes pour 8tre refectionne que les ingenieurs consultes
sont plutot favorables I la rehabilitation du CS de Matam et I I'abandon de l'h8pital.
*** Les districts de Gossas et Guinguineo, et de Foundiougne et Lokone, respectivement, partagent
l'effectif en personnel normal d'un CS de reference et d'un district ainsi que le materiel, 1'6quipement
et le budget y affdrent.
4.           L'application de cette base de planification a les consequences suivantes:
-     U n'est pas justifi6 de construire de nouveaux CS I Darou Mousti et I Bargny;
-     la presence de cinq CS de reference dans la rEgion de Fatick se justifie pour des raisons
d'accessibilite mais leur dotation sera reduite pour tenir compte de la population moindre couverte
par chacun;
-     les medecins qui travaillent dans des CS non promus comme centre de r6f6rence y restent si le
redeploiement permet de trouver le personnel ndcossaire au fonctionnement des structures de
reference. Toutefois, ces CS ne seront pas renforces, et en cas de d6part, il est conseill6 de ne
pas les remplacer I leur poste.
-     le partage des districts en departements sera effectu6 en tenant compte des flux de patients (no
pas rattacher un PS I un CS inutilisable pour les patients referds) et de manibre I obtenir un
partage equilibre des populations 2.
5.           L'application du decoupage en districts tel qu'il est pr6vu par la planification nationale
vaut pour Dakar. La population actuelle de Dakar (800.000) nejustifie absolumentpas, dans l'etat actuel
des choses, plus de 4 districts, d'autant que les hBpitaux du CHU (HALD , FANN) et de la municipalite
(Abas Ndao) font aussi office d'h8pital de second echelon; ils permettent de reduire les besoins en
infrastructures operationnelles de type CS dans le departement. S! la mairie soubaite faire fornctionner
des CS a Ouakam et aux parcelles assainies. il n'est Das souhaitable que. le MSPAS y affecte du
personnel sous peine de compromettre le developpement des PS prevus en vill. 1 est possible de
reconsiderer le nombre de district en 1995, a la lumibre d'une nouvelle distribution de la population.

REPUBLIOUE DU SENEGAL
PROJET DE DEVELOPPEMENT DES RESSOURCES HUMAINES
Population et Sante
Formation du Personnel des Districts Sanitaires
1.           La decentralisation de la planification des activites operationnelles et gestionnaires au
niveau des districts exige une harmonisation et une normalisation de la methodologie de formation du
personnel medical et paramddical des districts. Au cours des anndes ecoulees, nombreuses sont les
formations qui ont ete dispensees par le canal de projets et programmes, d'oih une grande heterogeneite
quant a leur objectif, a leur contenu, leur duree, leur methodologie, et aux instruments de support. Les
activitds etaient d'avantage choisies sur une base ad hoc que damn la perspective d'un programme integr6
et une strategie bien delimitee. n s'agit maintenant de rationaliser, d'harmoniser et de standardiser la
methodologie de formation du personnel en cours d'emploi et de la mettre I jour tenant compte de la
nouvelle politique nationale de la sante et du nouveau systeme de district sanitaire.
2.           Cette sous-composante soutiendra le d6veloppement d'une s6rie de programmes de
formation pour les medecins-chef de district (MCD) et les infirmiers chefs de postes de sante (ICP) en
vue de preparer ces individus pour la prise en charge de nouvelles responsabilites tant gestionnaires que
techniques. Le projet apportera egalement son appui I la preparation d'un plan de district sanitaire pour
diriger la mise en oeuvre des reformes au niveau des districts. Le deuxieme m&decin de district (MD2),
qui partagera les responsabilites de supervision et formation avec le MCD, participera au programme de
formation approprie et sera aussi forme en techniques de chirurgie d'urgence. Les medecins regionaux
(MCR) charges de la supervision du developpement du district sanitaire au sein de leur region respective
participeront a tous les programmes vises aux MCDs. Les programmes I developper comprennent:
Pour MCDs:
(a)    preparation d'un Plan de developpement du district sanitaire (PDDS) et la mise en place
des operations du district
(b)    gestion des medicaments, comites de santE, et gestion financiere des districts et postes
sanitaires
Pour MCDs et MD2s:
(c)    gestion des operations au niveau des districts, et supervision et formation des ICP
Pour MD2s:
(d)    chirurgie d'urgence (chaque MD2 sera accompagne par un infirmier du centre de sante
qui recevra une formation en techniques anesthesiques)

ANNEXE 3-5
Page 2 sur 9
Pour ICPs:
(e)    gestion d'un poste de sante, y compris le paquet minimum de services et activites
administratives.
Pour tous les themes de formation, l'Institut de Developpement Sanitaire (IDS) de l'universite de Dakar
aura la responsabilite technique de l'organisation des sessions et de la production des documents. La mise
au point de ceux-ci se fera sous la direction du MSPAS et en collaboration avec des representants de
divers projets operationnels tels que les projets "Sante Familiale", "Bien-Etre familial", "Thibs",
"Pikine", "Tambacounda", "Sante Rurale" - USAID, et "Sante Rurale - IDA.

A.    Objectifs et contenu des cours
3.           Plan de couverture geographique du district: Le plan de couverture d'un district
repond I trois questions: (i) Quelles sont les aires de responsabilite dependant d'un PS qui composent
la totalite de la superficie d'un district? (ii) Dans chaque aire, quelle est la localisation optimale du PS?
et (iii) S'il faut ouvrir de nouveaux PS ou transformer certaines structures (PMI, centres sociaux,...) en
PS, quelles en sont les priorites chronologiques? Pour chacune de ces questions, la methodologie de
i'elaboration des plans de couverture a ete formalisee. 1/

5.           Le d6veloppenent d'un PS: Chaque PS doit faire l'objet d'une strategie individualisEe
de developpement, qui sert de support aux supervisions techniques dont il fait l'objet.
(a)   les nouveaux PS: Un ordonnancement de l'ouverture d'un PS par la methode du chemin
critique (PERT) est propose en annexe du document "Progranmation de l'appui de la
Banque Mondiale au developpement des circonscriptions medicales. 11 comprend en
particulier l'engagement de la communaute, la construction et l'equipement, la formation,
les contacts directs avec la population (e recensement et l'inscription) (voir Pangu K.

de la phase preparatoire I cette serie de seminaires.
C.    Calendrier
7.            II est important pour la politique de sante du pays que les PDDS soient prets le plus tot
possible. La formation aura lieu au cours de I'annde qui precede la mise en vigueur du PDRH, sur
financement du Projet Sante Rurale (PSR). On prevoit deux series de cinq seminaires d'une semaine
chacun. Douze mddecins assisteront I chaque serie (45 MCD + 10 MCR + 5 du niveau central du
MSP). Pour chaque serie, les participants seront recrutes dans toutes les regions de maniere a eviter d'en
affaiblir une par le depart simultane de tous ses cadres.

9.            L'approvisionnement en medicaments essentiels depend de la rAussite d'une strategie
complexe dont les elements doivent etre executes de maniere coordonnee. On peut comparer les
medicaments I l'eau d'une baignoire dont le niveau devrait etre maintenu constant ou en legere expansion:

Les objectifs de formation dont l'ensemble est destine k doter les MCD des competences necessaires I
l'organisation de 1'approvisionnement en medicaments sont enumeres ci-dessous:



- 88 -
ANNEXhE 3-5
Page 4 sur 9
1)    Un investissement initial doit Otre trouve (demarches auprbs d'un bailleur de fonds/agence
de cooperation, organisation d'un evenement social (tombola, ffte), pouvoirs locaux,
participation/collecte...). Pas de formation particulibre requise.
2)     Les prescripteurs doivent etre formds a l'utilisation de schemas therapeutiques
standardises; ces schemas doivent decrire les traitements de syndromes et sympt6mes frequents
qui ndcessitent des medicaments chers ou nombreux. De tels schemas ont ete mis au point par
un groupe de travail dirige par la DSP. lls sont decrits dans un fascicule a l'usage des MCD qui
regroupe (a) des conduites a tenir, (b) des notions de therapie, et (c) des donnees
pharmacologiques. Seules les conduites a tenir doivent 8tre enseignees dans le contexte de
l'approvisionnement en medicaments essentiels. L'objectif est de faire appliquer ces schemas par
les medecins eux-memes s'ils sont amenes a traiter des pathologies primaires et de faire former
tous les prescripteurs de leur district au cours de seminalres (eur duree est d'une a deux apres-
midi en tout).
3)     Les prescripteurs doivent etre formes I l'education sanitaire des patients en matibre
d'utilisation des m6dicaments essentiels, ainsi qu'a l'empathie avee les patients. L'objeciif est que
les prescripteurs sachent convaincre les patients de l'efflcacit6 identique ou superieure des
nouveaux schdmas therapeutiques, sachent discuter utiement avec eux des mddicaments
essentiels, et rechercher aussi d'autres solutions que mddicamenteuses a leurs problames
(approche psychotherapeutique, psycho-sociale, etc).
4)     La pharmacie du district doit 8tre organisee efficacement. Le MCD doit savoir former
le personnel de la pharmacie, adapter et utiliser les supports, organiser les stocks et leur securit6,
effectuer les commandes basdes sur l'utilisation anterieure des medicaments. La confection de
pommades et de comprimes, et le recyclage des flacons ne font pas partie des objectifs prioritaires
de la formation.
5)     Des stocks doivent 8tre mis en place dans les services. Les infirmiers chefs de service
et de poste de sante doivent etre formds I l'utilisation des cahiers de requisition, aux commandes
hebdomadaires (pour les services du CS) ou mensuelles (pour les services du PS).
6)     Une pharmacie de detail au CS doit etre organisee. Son responsable doit savoir tenir les
cahiers (enregistrement du nom des patients, numerotation des tickets, description des
medicaments fournis...);
7)     La  participation  de  la  population  doit etre  redynamisee  a  l'occasion  de
l'approvisionnement en medicaments essentiels, non seulement pour assainir la gestion des
finances du PS, mais aussi parce que l'offre d'un service nouveau met le personnel de sante dans
une position favorable 4 la negociation. Les infirmiers chefs de PS devront savoir comment
travailler avec les comites de sant6 et stimuler la participation, mobiiser les avoirs financiers des
comites de sante, connattre les recours et procedures en cas d'abus. Ils devront aussi savoir
former le billeteur aux procddures requises.
8)     Les recettes des structures de sante doivent correspondre au volume de prestations
dElivrEee. Ceci suppose le bouclage du CS par un mur d'enceinte avec mise en place d'une
guerite I l'entree (aucune personne non munie d'un ticket ne peut rentrer le matin), l'impression
de tickets numerotEs, pour chaque activite du PS, la destruction des tickets lors de l'activite ou
de la dotation de medicaments I un particulier, la tenue d'un cahier de vente de ticket par le

billeteur (une colonne pdr ticket, avec premier et demier numero du jour et une ligne par jour),
le contrUle par le MCD ou le superviseur des SSP, en cooperation avec le bureau de I'association
des comites du district, de l'adequation entre les rentrees financibres et le volume d'activite des
PS, le controle mensuel de cette adequation au CS par le major;
9)     Un systeme comptable approprie doit etre utilise au CS, dans les PS, et pour l'ensemble
du district, congu comme un instrument de gestion.
10)   L'equipe cad.-e du district doit savoir evaluer la consommation des medicaments (par
exemple par la comparaison semestrielle des consommations par 100 nouveaux cas des principaux
medicaments dans les PS du district) et le bilan financier des structures sanitaires.
11)   La strategie de developpement pharmaceutique du district doit etre eiaboree. Elle sera
effectu6e par le stagiaire au cours d'un exercice qui lui permettra de preciser pour son district
la programmation de l'extension, les etapes vers un flux du medicament plus efficace (voir
schema), l'integration de l'approvisionnement des structures specialisees (GE, SMI, etc), le
couplage entre approvisionnement en medicaments et financement, etc.

A.    Objectifs et contenu de la formation
14.           A l'issue de cette formation, les MCD doivent etre capables de comprendre et d'etudier
les strategies pour medecins et les instructions pour infirmiers chefs de poste decrivant les activites
operationnelles d'un PS. Ils doivent &tre capables d'apprendre aux agents de leur district ces activites,
et d'en effectuer la supervision t chnique. Les fascicules seront distribues aux participants a l'occasion
des sdminaires de formation, a raison de l/PS et 2/districts pour les instructions, et 2/district pour les
strategies. Le programme decrit ci-dessus est enseigne en une semaine de formation (5 jours et demi soit
44 heures de cours).
B.    Prealables a la formation
1S.           Les supports ("stratEgies" pour les medecins; "instructions" pour les ICP) doivent etre
prealablement elabores par l'IDS, sous la direction de la DSP. nI s'agit de rediger, d'editer, d'imprimer,
de relier, et de distribuer ces documents, qui concernent:
(1) pour les strategies - les activites operationnelles des PS, I savoir, la consultation curative
(comite de rationalisation de la prescription), le planning familial (voir USAID, BEF, SANFAM,
FNUAP...), la prise en charge des chroniques (PNT, instructions du projet de Thies), les
consultations prenatales (Pikine, projet de Thies), les consultations de nourrisson (Jnicef, projet
de Thies, PEV..."', la nutrition (voir SANAS, projet de Thies); l'offre de soins de recours reels
par les CS; et le travail administratif au CS et au district (systeme d'information, dossiers
d'hospitalisation).
2) pour les infirmiers - les instructions relatives I ces m8mes activites;
3) celles relatives aux activites administratives du PS (comptabilite, gestion des mddicaments,
recensement, enregistrement, participation, travail du billeteur, etc).
Avant que ces trois fascicules ne soient constitues, deux autres seront prepares, qui seront distribues avant
d'8tre ulterieurement integres aux trois fascicules sus-mentionnEs:  (i) les strategies relatives a

I'elaboration des PDDS (y compris les plans de couverture et l'initiation d'un PS); et (ii) les instructions
relatives I la distribution du medicament essentiel. Ces deux documents seront ult6rieurement integres
dans les trois fascicules sus-mentionnes.
C.    Calendrier
16.          Le debut de cette serie de s6minaire est conditionne par le travail prealable (relativement
long). La formation commencera la premibre annee du PDRH, environ six mois apres la formation I
l'approvisionnement en medicaments essentiels. On prevoit dix series de seminaires d'une semaine
chacun. Dix m6decins assisteront I chaque serie (45 MCD + 40 MD2 + 10 MCR + 5 du niveau
central du MSP). 11 est souhaitable que pour chaque serie, les participants aient ete recrutes dans toutes
les regions de manibre I eviter d'en affaiblir une par le depart en formation simultan6 de tous ses cadres.
D.    Financement
17.          La preparation des supports est prevue sur PPF, le financement des seminaires proprement
dit etant realise par le PDRH.
E.    Cndit!o
18.          La formation du MCD conditionne la mise en place du stock de medicaments dans les
infrastructures prevues du district.
IV.   Chirurgie d'urgnce
19.          Les deuxibme medecins de district (MD2) seront formes en chirurgie abdominale
d'urgence et en traumatologie. Certains infirmiers seront formes I l'anesthesie (techniques de rachi-
anesthesie et bases de la reanimation). La population cible sera prioritairement les m6decins et infirmiers
des CS enclaves. Les chirurgiens de Guediawaye, Ziguinchor et Saint-Louis seront charges de l'execution
des formations et les cooperations techniques frangaise et belge chargdes de sa realisation. Le suivi sera
assure par les chirurgiens des hbpitaux reg,onaux du medecin. La supervision de la formation initiale
sera la responsabilite de la DSP et les supervisions techniques ultericures celle du medecin forme Oe
chirurgien regional, a raison d'une visite d'un jour tous les deux mois). La duree prevue d'une formation
est quatre mois par medecin, pendant lesquels la DSP assurera leur remplacement par un stagiaire.
V.    Formation des ICP aux activitfs opkrationnelles. logistiques et administratives d'un PS
A.    Objectifs de formation
20.           L'infirmier chef de poste doit maitriser les activites suivantes:
(a)    activites medico sanitaires (celles du paquet minimum d'activites) - consultation curative (y
compris la rationalisation de la prise de decision, la rationalisation de la prescription, la prise en
charge psycho-sociale et l'empathie), la consultation prenatale, la consultation des nourrissons
sains, le planning familial, la prise en charge des malades chroniques (tuberculeux et lepreux),
la recuperation nutritionnelle. Ces activites supposent deux types de capacite, I savoir techniques
et organisationnelles.



- 92 -
ANNEXE! 3-5
Page 8 sur 9
(b)    activites administratives - le recensement, l'inscription, le comptage, I'assistance et la co-gestion
avec le comitd de sante, le traitement discriminatoire des populations (selon qu'elles sont inscrites
ou non), la supervision du clerc (billeteur), la tenue et I'interpretation du systeme d'information.
Ce dernier point comprend en particulier le comptage et la mise I jour du denominateur, le
remplissage du rapport mensuel standard d'activite, la tenue des fiches individuelles et des
cahiers.
(c)    activitds logistigues - la tenue des outils de comptabilite et de gestion des medicaments (cabier
de commande, etc.), l'utilisation des instructions ecrites.
B.    Mdthodologie de formatiQn
21.           La formation des infirmiers chefs de poste (ICP) commencera par un sdminaire de 15
jours. Ensuite leur formation sera essentiellement assuree par des visites de supervision formative du
mddecin chef de district ou du deuxieme medecin de district. Au cours de ces visites seront pris en
compte les aspects cliniques, les aspects d'organisation du travail et les aspects de
commiunication/Education interpersonnelle. La formation complete d'un infirmier chef de poste
demandera 15 visites (une visite de demonstration par le medecin, suivi de deux visites pendant lesquelles
l'infirmier execute les interventions, sous l'oeil du medecin). Ce processus sera r6pete pour cinq groupes
d'intervention:  (i) activitds administratives - inscription de la population/systbme d'information;
(ii) gestion financibre et pharmaceutique/organisation de la participation communautaire; (iii) activitds
curatives; (iv) activites PEV/TRO/Nutrition/IEC; et (v) activites pr6natales/PF/MST/nourrissons
sains/lEC.
22.           Si l'on considere que chacun des deux medecins du district peut consacrer quatre visites
par mois I cette activite, il dispose d'un potentiel de 48 visites de formation par an et il peut donc achever
la formation de deux a trois ICP par an. 11 est prevu de former quatre ICP par district par an. Au
niveau national, huit seminaires de 15 jours (par groupe de 20 ICP) seront organises chaque annee, I
partir de la deuxieme annee du projet. En quatre ans seront donc formes environ 720 ICP (4 ICP x 42
districts x 4 ans).
23.           Une description ddtaillde du contenu de la formation organisee autour de neuf themes
(consultation curative, consultation prdnatale, consultation des nourrissons sains, prise en charge des
malades chroniques, nutrition, planning familial, inscription de la population, tenue et interprEtation du
systeme d'information, gestion fmnanciere et pharmaceutique) est trouvde en Appendice 2 de la presente
annexe.
C.    Organisation des seminaires de formation
24.           Un total de 32 sdminaires de formation des ICP seront organises pendant la periode du
programme, avec deux sdminaires de 15 jours chacun tous les trois mois a partir de la deuxieme annEe
du programme, jusqu'a la fm de la quatrieme annee. L'Institut de Developpement Sanitaire (IDS) sera
charge de la mise en oeuvre du programme, sous la supervision du MSPAS. Pour appuyer son propre
personnel dmns la mise en oeuvre de ce programme exigeant et afin d'etablir des liens etroits entre le
systeme de formation des infirmiers et sage-femmes et le programme de recyclage propos6, l'IDS fera
appel a quelques enseignants des Ecoles des Infirmier(e)s et des Sage-Femmes pour participer en tant
qu'enseignants du programme propose. Les locaux de l'Ecole des Infirmier(e)s seront utilisdes pour
l'exdcution des s6minaires.

25.           L'IDS sera egalement chargE du developpement et de 1'ex6cution d'un plan d'evaluation
sur l'impact de cette formation. A cette fin, il etablira un systeme de 'feedback" de la part des MCD
et des ICP-stagialres et, vers la fin de chaque annee de mise en oeuvre, effectuera des visites auprbs d'un
echantillon prelev6 au hasard des anciens stagiaires en vue d'6valuer les aspects forts ainsi que les
faiblesses du programme. L'IDS reverra le programme tous les ans et apportera tous changements
n6cessaires sur la base des r6sultats de ses examens.

Formation des infirmiers chefs de poste aux
activites operationnelles. logistigues et administratives
Contenue et M&thodoloeie
I.    Consultation curative
Objectifs:
-     application des schemas therapeutiques standardises et negociation avec les patients
-     empathie et prise en charge du probleme du patient
-     utilisation de la fiche curative, du cahier de consultation, et de la fiche de synthese
-     delegation du travail de nursing I un ASC
-     organisation du circuit des patients
MEthodes:
Pour enseigner les schemas therapeutiques, il y a intdr8t I regrouper les infirmiers qui devront
les appliquer en un groupe. Les schemas peuvent etre enseignes en une journ6e. Pour chaque
symptome ou syndrome, 1'enseignement joue des divergences de pratique entre participants pour
montrer l'inefficience ou l'inefficacite de leurs schemas et promouvoir les nouvelles attitudes
cliniques. Les 15 infirmiers chefs de poste peuvent participer au seminaire, mais si l'on ne
demande qu'k une partie d'entre eux de rationaliser effectivement la th6rapeutique, il vaut mieux
ne former que ces derniers.
Comme chaque fois qu'il est question de travail administratif, ce sont des exercices qui suivent
un briefing qui pennettent le mieux d'enseigner l'utiisation des supports (fiches et cahiers). nl
y a int6r8t a prevoir la distribution d'un stock de supports que les participants pourront ramener
chez eux et utiliser imm6diatement.
L'empathie peut s'apprendre theoriquement, mais le mieux est d'organiser l'observation
individuelle d'une consultation faite par un infirmier tres empathique.
L'organisation du circuit des patients doit Wtre faite par le medecin superviseur du PS ot i profite
de la disposition des lieux pour amdliorer le confort, reduire les temps d'attente, 6viter les
bousculades.

II.    Consultation pr6natale (CPN
Objectifs:
-     theorie de la prenatale (detection des femmes I risque d'accouchement dystocique, y
compris le calcul de la dZate theorique de l'accouchement et detection et prise en charge
des anomalies de grossesse comnme les infections des voies urinaires, les infections
gynecologiques, les preeclampsies, et vaccination anti-tetanique)
-     la pratique d'une prenatale, I'application des instructions, le contenu des deux contacts
systematiques prevus pour toute grossesse et celui des consultations non planifiees
-     l'utilisation de la fiche et du cahier de CPN
-     le recrutement pour la post-natale et le planning familial
-     I'organisation d'une PM! mobile
MEthodes:
La theorie et le travail administratif peuvent Wtre enseignes en groupe. Mais il vaut mieux qu'ils
le soient individuellement ou, I la rigueur, par groupes de deux parce que: (i) la partie pratique
doit imp6rativement etre enseign6e par des demonstrations; (ii) celles-i ne peuvent etre
organisees pour tous les CS d'un district simultanement car l'extension par niveau de soins n'est
pas appropriee pour la CPN; et (iii) il n'est pas souhaitable qu'un intervalle de tempe important
separe la formation theorique de l'enseignement pratique.
On preconise donc que soit combines les enseignements theoriques et pratiques, et qu'ils soient
fournis I des groupes de deux ou trois I la fois (une ou deux sessions par an).
L'apprentissage pratique s'effectue de la miniere suivants:
-     on regroupe dans un PS les infirmiers des PS voisins concernes par l'implantation de la
CPN;
-     quelques femmes enceintes sont convoquees pour le jour de la visite du medecin
superviseur;
-     devant un ou deux infirmiers, le medecin effectue quelques prenatales;
-     ensuite, un infirmier en fera une, alternativement, avec le medecin;
-     lors de la seance suivante, l'infirmier les fera toutes, sous la supervision du medecin.
Eventuellement, on peut accompagner cet apprentissage d'un stage dans un PS ob la CPN
rationalisee a deja ete integree.
L'apprentissage theorique prealable concerne la notion de risque, le traitement des anormalitds
de la grossesse, l'organisation d'une PMI mobile et le decoupage de l'aire on sous-secteurs
preventifs (qui seront utilises aussi pour les CNS/PEV).

-     pratique:  application des instructions ecrites, recolte correcte d'une expectoration,
prelevement cutane, deroulement de la premibre consultation d'un nouveau cas
M6thodes:
Pratique: les apprentissages de la fixation d'une lame, de la collecte d'une expectoration et du
pre1evement cutand peuvent 8tre effectues lors d'un bref sejour dans un centre hospitalier oli ces
actes sont pratiqu6s frequemment; le deroulement d'une consultation s'apprend par d6monstration,
comme pour la CPN. On recommande que le materiel imprime, I'echeancier, les lames, etc.,
soient amenes le jour oti le superviseur effectue les demonstrations. On suggere que des
tuberculeux sous traitement soient convoquees ce jour afin d'initier pour chacun d'eux un dossier
nouvelle formule.
Theorie: la th6orie et le travail administratif peuvent etre enseignes comme pour la CPN.
V.    Nutrition

REPUBLIOUE DU SENEGAL
PROJET DE DEVELOPPEMENT DES RESSOURCES HUMA1NES
Populadion et Sant
Les Plans de Developpement du District sanitairm
1.           Pour pouvoir mettre en oeuvre la reforme des services de sante et la d6centralisation au
niveau du district sanitaire, un plan d'action, de couverture et de budgetisation des besoins intitule "Plan
de Developpement du District Saiiitaire, ou PDDS, sera elabore par l'equipe-cadre de chaque district.
11 s'agit d'un plan local qui decrit les objectifs a court terme de la strategie de developpement adoptee
par l'equipe-cadre du district. La frequence des obstacles que l'on rencontre dans l'execution d'un PDDS
et celle des changements de l'environnement, en font un processus iteratif I cycle court; une revision
annuelle est donc necessaire. Des lors il n'est pas souhaitabie que le PDDS soit un document complexe,
ni que son elaboration rnecessite un long travail.
2.           Le PDDS est egalement un outil de motivation et d'engagement pour les responsables du
district sanitaire. II sert de guide k la supervision par le m6decin-chef de rEgion, et de canevas pour
l'evaluation. I doit imperativement s'inscrire dans le cadre des normes 6dict6es par le MSPAS;
l'ignorance de certaines regles dans sa conception exposerait le d6veloppement sanitaire I des risques
serieux. L'appui technique a sa rdalis.cion est fourni par le MCR (qui devrait donc etro titulaire d'une
maltrise en sant6 publique).
3.           Le PDDS indique comment l'organisation des services de sante a 1'Echelon du district se
rapprochera de son organisation optimale, comment les structures parviendront progressivement I assuret
les activites du paquet minimum, et comment les ressources seront procurees et utilisees.
4.           Tous les PDDS d'une region sanitaire seront ensuite integrds au "Plan de Developpement
de la Region sanitaire" (PDRS) apres quo les ajustements necessaires auront ete apportds au vu des
moyens humains et financiers dont dispose la region.
Contenu du PDDS
5.           Chaque PDDS sera compose de deux parties. La premiere partie comportera les elements
suivants:
(a)    un plan de couverture geographique qui delimite les zones de responsabilite de chaque PS existant
ou a creer (une aire d'intervention) ne peut Otre couverte que par une seule zone et qui indique
la localisation de chaque PS I l'interieur de cette zone. Le plan de couverture indique dgalement
les priorites en matiere d'ouverture de nouveaux PS et de rationalisation des PS existants.
(O)   un etat qualitatif et quantitatif de la couverture en infrastructure et prestations sanitaires du
district.

ANNXE 36
Page 2 sur 3
(c)    un plan d'action de l'equipe-cadre du district. Son horizon est a deux ans et iI est destine I
preciser les modalites d'evolution des services de sante vers la physionomie prevue pour eux par
la planification nationale. 11 decrit In profil des PS I creer et explique la rationalisation des
activites, les aitivites I implanter, la rationalisation de l'utilisation des ressources disponibles et
de celles qu'il faut se procurer y compris le redeploiement ou recrutement du personnel, le cas
echeant, et le renforcement du plateau technique du PS et des fonctions de direction/coordination
du district.
(d)    un etat des besoins comprenant un budget et sa comparaison avec les ressources disponibles.
6.            La ueuxieme partie concernera:
(a)    la cooperation multisectorielle: definition de la contribution des autres partenaires et des modes
de cooperation.
(b)    la promotion sanitaire et I'assainissement: identification des taches prioritaires et ddfinition des
responsabilites en matiere d'hygiene. Ce volet ne fait pas pa,tie du paquet minimum d'activite
des services de sante de base; il est cependant necessaire que les problemes d'hygibne importants
et vulnerables soient cibles par le personnel des districts lorsque les ressources le permettent.
Choix des activitEs
7.            Le PDDS precise les objectifs du district sanitaire et il incombe I son equipe-cadre de
decider du choix des activites I mener au niveau:
du PS:
les activites operationnelles (consultations curatives, prenatales, des nourrissons sain; rEcupdration
nutritionnelle; vaccination; PF; prise en charge des malades chroniques).
les activites logistiques et gestiunnaires (identification des sous-secteurs preventifs; PMI mo; as;
recensement; rationalisation de la gestion financibre et pharmaceutique; mobilisation des
ressources; participation et inscription de la population au PS; activites du comit6 de gestion).
du CS:
les activites opErationnelles et gestionnaires (mise en place d'un systbme d'information pour
l'evaluation; realisation du plateau technique, dont les urgences medicales/chirurgicales, le
laboratoire, les radiographies); activites du comite de gestion.
du district:
les activites logistiques et gestionnaires (constitution de l'equipe-cadre; formation des infirmiers;
rationalisation de la gestion et contrOle financier des echelons de base; mise en place de la
pharmacie du district; communication entre les structures; syst&me d'information; rationalisation
des activites et adaptation des programmes nationaux aux realites locales; application des criteres
de fonctionnement du systbme intdgrE).

8.            Le Pan d'action est organise selon les axes suivants:
(a)    la constitution de i'equipe-cadre du district: sa composition, la rdpwvtition des PS a superviser,
autres les membres de I'equipe, le partage de l'activite chimique, la formation de l'equipe cn
sante publique, les reunions, les modalites operationnelles;
(b)    la formation des infirmiers, principalement les chefs de poste: definition du contenu et du lieu
des stages et organisation de la formation;
(c)    la rationalisation de la logistique et de la gestion (en particulier pour la pharmacie
d'approvisionnement);
(d)    la rationalisation des structures de reference et de l'utilisation des ressources. Trois aspects sont
a considerer:  (a) le renforcement de l'echelon de recours, (b) I'approvisionnement en
medicaments essentiels, et (c) le plan de redeploiement du personnel;
(e)    la rationalisation des activites du PS, y compris l'adaptation des programmes nationaux et de leurs
instructions aux conditions du district et l'adaptation des instructions nationales relatives a
l'utilisation des ressources;
(f)    1'extensIon de la couverture:  programmation dans le temps de nouvelles structures ou de
nouvelles activites; amelioration de l'equipement des PS; reorganisation de certains PS;
(g)    la mise en place des comites de sante et le developpement de leurs activites.

EMIuation et Sat
Le programme de redeploiement et
de r ttnent du personnel de sante publique
Cadre general de I'analyse
1.      II a ete demand6 a une firme de consultants senegalaise de: (i) proceder au recensement du
personnel present au debut de 1990 dans les divers services du MSPAS; (ii) d'aider ensuite la DAGE I
actualiser et uniformiser son fichier du personnel avee ceux des autres sources (Fonction publique et
Direction du budget); et (iii) analyser comment repartir le personnel existant pour permettre au MSPAS
de mieux remplir ses fonctions et notamment mieux rdpondre aux objectifs prioritaires de la Politique
nationale de sante (PNS) adoptee en decembre 1989. On notera que cette annexe ne prend pas en compte
le personnel de la Direction de l'action sociale et des autres personnels qui ont ete transf6r6s au MSPAS
apras le remaniement ministeriel d'avril 1990 de m8me d'ailleurs que celui des institutions non gerees
par le MSPAS et donc se limite I celui de sante publique dependant du MSPAS.
Diagnostic sur la situation actuelle
2.       En janviei 1990, 5.601 agents du secteur sante ont Ete recenses. Ils se repartissent en: (a) le
personnel de sante travaillant dans des services sous la tutelle du MSPAS, soit 5.434 individus composes
de 5.320 nationaux (5.027 employes du MSPAS et 293 employEs municipaux), et de 114 assistants
techniques; et (b) 167 agents du MSPAS detaches dans des organismes dont la gestion ne depend pas
directement de ce ministere.
3.       Le regroupement par categories des 5.601 personnel de sante publique recense, resume dans
le tableau 1 ci-dessous, est divise en deux grandes categories: (i) les specialites de sante, largement
representees et clairement identifiables, comprenant le personnel medical (medecins gendralistes,
specialistes, pharmaciens et dentistes), paramedical (infirmier d'Etat (IE), sage-femme (SF), et agent
sanitaire (AS)), et les aide-infirmiers; et (ii) les specialites qui sont nombreuses et faiblement representees
chacune, a l'exception de ceux travaillant I l'HP. Cette Annexe se concentre sur la programmation de
la premiere categorie - personnel mddical et paramedical. En ce qui concerne la deuxieme categorie,
elle differencie certaines specialitds techniques (agent d'hygiene, laborantin, etc.) de celles liees I la
gestion administrative (comptable, secrdtaire, commnis, etc.) et du personnel de soutien (manoeuvre,
planton, etc.); le detail se trouve dans le rapport des consultants. Globalement, on notera un premier
element concernant le personnel medical; 15% des medecins sont encore d'origine etrangere, malgre un
chomage signale dans les diplomds de la Faculte de mddecine; cela tiendrait au manque d'attraction aupres
des Etudiants senegalais de certaines specialites notamment hospitalibres, mais il apparaltrait aussi que ces
jeunes dipldmds refusent d'aller pratiquer la medecine privee en dehors de la region de Dakar ot la
concurrence est deja forte, situation aggravee par les conditions economiques qui se deteriorent. Un

deuxibme element Important pour l'avenir du secteur est la faiblesse numerique du personnel

-    994 dans les postes de sante (auxquels s'ajoutent 230 employes municipaux).
-     1.118 dans les centres, avec 63 employes municipaux en plus.
-    666 dans les h8pitaux regionaux, dont 75 dans les hOpitaux de Dioum et Ourroussogui qui
doivent Wtre restructurds.
-    895 au CHU (compose de 4 hBpitaux I Dakar)
soit pour les soins directs: 3.673 (73% du total) dont 2.112 pour les districts (42% du total)
-    79 dans les regions medicales M)
-    210 aux services des grandes endemies (GE)

-    44 pour la medecine scolaire (MS)
-    277 pour les structures specialisees If dont 150 au centre PMI-Medina et I l'IHS qui vont
8tre restructurds.
-     165 aux services centraux du MSPAS
soit pour les services specialises: 1.354 (ou 25% du total).
1/ Ce sont: CNTS (transfision sanguine, CPS (pediatrie sociale), centres de sante Diop et

AN XE 3-7
Page 3 sur 11
On notera que deux hOpitaux et deux structures specialisees seront vi u. cturees en postes et centres
conformement aux normes d'implantation admises au niveau de-s districts. Si on regroupe les postes de
sante, les centres de sante, les equipes travaillant dans les regions medicales et les services des grandes
endemies et ces quatre infrastructures, on obtient un pool de 2.912 employes qui sera directement
implique dans le plan de redeploiement car toutes ces structures sanitaires ont fait l'objet d'un plan de
redeploiement et de normes d'allocation par categories.
5.       Le Tableau 2, page 6, donne la localisation dans les dix regions et par grandes categories.
Compare I la population residente recensee en 1988, on constate des distorsions importantes. Alors que
la region de Dakar concentre 22% du total de la population du pays, 45% du personnel employe par le
MSPAS y travaille; cela reflete la concentration des services centraux et du CHU. Si on isole les
structures donnant directement des soins - postes, centres, hopitaux - ces distorsions sont sensiblement
attenuees, puisque Dakar meme avec le CHU ne concentre plus que 30% du total; on doit noter cependant
l'impact, pour les deux regions de Fatick et Kolda, de l'absence d'un hOpital regional (HR).
Bases d'evaluation des besois en personnel
6.       Les normes retenues sont les suivantes:
(a)  or le post, qui couvre une zone de 10.000 habitants en moyenne: un paramedical, pour 8tre chef
de poste (ICP), soit un IE, une SF ou un AS avec une formation adequate pour les preparer a des
fonctions qui ne leur ont pas ete enseignees dans les ecoles professionnelles de sante; et dges agnts
de soutien. Ces derniers seront payes par les associations de sante; le minimum est d'avoir un
billeteur-secretaire pour assurer le paiement des tarifs de visites, plus de 1 a 2 ouvriers-manoeuvres-
plantons fonction des activitds du poste.
(b) pour le centre de reference, qui couvre un district sanitaire entre 150.000 et 300.000 habitants vers
1995, soit 20 postes de reference en moyenne, on devrait prevoir un personnel de 30 personnes
comprenant: 3 medecins, afin d'assurer collectivement la supervision de tous les postes avec le
nmddecin chef du centre (MCD); 14 paramedicaux, soit 4 SF et 10 IE/AS (on admet une certaine
flexibilite entre les deux profils et que les AS peuvent etre recycles en IE s'il y a des AS en excbs);
10 specialistes, soit 1 charge de la pharmacie (qui devrait etre un AS), 3 techniciens (hygiene,
assainissement, odontologie), 3 aide-infirmiers et 3 matrones; et 3 administratifs, dont 1 gestionnaire,
1 secretaire et 1 chauffeur. On notera que la presence du troisibme medecin est necessaire quand les
20 postes I surveiller fonctionnent & plein et la population depasse 250.000.
(c) por un disij, qui supervise jusqu'a 20 postes, une equipe de 4 specialistes doit soutenir les 3
medecins; il s'agit d'un superviseur SSP, qui peut etre un XE avec anciennete et brevet du centre de
formation CESSI, 1 superviseur SMI/PF et 1 charge de la pharmacie, qui peuvent 8tre un XE ou un
AS, et 1 charge des programmes EPS; cette equipe sera assistde d'un administrateur-gestionnaire, un
secretaire et un chauffeur. On notera que pour les capitales regionales, ox le centre de reference est
l'HR, il faudra prevoir les 3 medecins et cette equipe de district en sus du personnel de l'HR.
(d) pour les services regionaux, on se limite, dans les programmes decrits dans cette Annexe, a
restructurer le service de la region medicale (RM), soit autour du medecin chef de region (MCR) 5
agents dont 1 IE et 3 administratifs; et celui des grandes endemies (GE), soit 1 medecin et 2 agents
au niveau regional et 1 a 3 equipes mobiles en fonction de la rEgion, chacune composee de 1 XE ou
1 AS, 1 administratif, et 1 agent. On a admis en raison du deficit aigu de medecins qu'il n'y aurait
pas de medecin I temps plein pour les GE d'ici 1995.

(e) pour un h6pital r6gional (HR), on se limitera a ajouter son personnel actuel I'equipe de district et des
2 ou 3 medecins ndcessaires pour assurer les fonctions du district (voir plus haut) en plus de celles
hospitalibres et celles qui resulte du r6le de deuxieme echelon dans toutes les capitales regionales, I
l'exception de Dakar; une priorit6 sera de verifier que ces HR disposent d'un chirurgien et d'un
gynecologue formes. Le rapport des consultants a recommande des normes, qui ont ete discutdes par
un groupe de travail ad hoc convoque par le MSPAS, mais sans etre formellement endossees par la
mission IDA. Pour la preparation de ce projet, le secteur hospitalier regional n'a pas en effet ete pris
en compte, car une etude plus complete re-evaluant les fonctions de ces structures, notamment visa--
vis des districts nouvellement definis, pour finaliser les normes de personnel et les possibilites de
financement, est fortement recommandee, voir para. 17. Z/
(f) pour le CHU, les consultants recommandent un personnel de 1.090 comparees aux 895 actuelles, soit
195 supplementaires comprenant: (a) 35 au niveau du personnel medical comprenant 35 specialistes,
dont 15 psychiatres et 8 traumatologues mais 5 pharmaciens en trop; (b) 70 dans les paramedicaux
comprenant 90 infirmiers specialises mais 13 sage-femmes et 7 agents sanitaires en trop; et (c) 95
autres agents dont essentiellement 87 aide-infirmiers. Ces normes n'ont pas ete revues a ce stade,
le CHU faisant l'objet d'un plan directeur de developpement I long terme, finance par la BAD; on
finalisera ses normes de personnel par la suite.
7.       Pour le plan de redeploiement decrit dans cette Annexe, on retient donc les normes prevues
en ce qui concerne le reseau de postes de sante, des centres de sante et des districts sanitaires (par.3).
En ce qui conceme les h6pitaux regionaux (HR), on verifiera que l'HR dispose d'un chirurgien et d'un
gynecologue, et que le reste du personnel existant est au moins dquivalent I celui d'un centre de sante.
En ce qui concerne les categories, on se concentrera sur comment satisfaire les besoins en personnel
medical et paramedical des districts qui devront etre renforces en priorite d'ici 1995.
8.       Rappelons en outre que la programmation de ces besoins sera liee: (i) k la prdparation et I
l'execution des PDDS - plan de developpement des districts de sante - et des PRDS qui les agregent au
niveau des regions medicales; et (ii) I la creation et au fonctionnement d'un reseau de comites de sante
au niveau de chaque poste, eux-m8mes reunis en associations au niveau des centres de reference
correspondants (Annexe 3-10).
9.       Dans le cadre du developpement d'un systeme de sante performant et repondant aux objectifs
de la PNS (en particulier la priorite aux SSP), il a ete retenu, a l'horizon 1995, une structure pyramidale
de services sanitaires (voir l'Annexe 3-4 sur la composante du PDRH relative a la promotion des districts,
pour dEtails). Elle est basee, dans les 10 regions mddicales existantes, sur 45 districts de sante dans
lesquels seront mis en place 918 postes de sante relies a 44 centres de reference (I'HR de Ziguinchor
couvrant les districts de Ziguinchor et Oussouye). 11 y aura donc 20 postes par district en moyenne, et
pour jouer le rOle de centre de reference, 35 centres de sante et 9 HR dans les capitales regionales, en
admettant que deux centres de sante - Kolda et Fatick -- seront graduellement promus en HR.
Z/ Pour un HR qui couvre une zone de 600.000 k 700.000 personnes, soit trois districts, le
rapport des consultants prevoit un personnel de 130 personnes environ, dont 11 medecins, 49
paramedicaux (18 IE, 11 SF, et 20 AS), 36 aide-infirmiers et 34 autres specialistes et agents de
soutien. N&anmoins, avant d'adopter ces normes pour tous les 9 HR, il est necessaire d'analyser
plus en profondeur le r8le qui sera assignp a ces HR dans le nouveau systeme de reference qui est
en train de se mettre en place. On notera qu'avec ces normes, tous les HR sont globalement
largement deficitaires en personnel, et en pratique pour toutes les categories.

ANNEXE 3-7
Page 5 sur 11
10.           Globalement, et pour le personnel medical et paramedical en dehors des activites
strictement hospitalieres dans les HR et au CHU, ce systeme necessiterait avec les normes resumees
(tableaux 2 et 3 ci-dessous) par rapport I la situation actuelle (tableau 1 ci-dessus):
-  pour les postes de sante et leurs 918 ICP programmes d'ici 1995, on peut les comparer aux 732
paramedicaux actuellement dans ces postes - combinant 343 IE, 96 SF et 293 AS - ces derniers
devant etre recycles avant de devenir ICP.
- pour les 45 districts, on aura besoin de:
85 medecins de sante publique (MSP) immediatement et 44 progressivement en fonction
du croft de la population (plus de 250.000 personnes par district; d'ici 1995, ce sera le
cas dans 13 districts de 6 regions - Dakar, Kaolack, Kolda, Louga, Saint-Louis et
Ziguinchor - Tableau 2 ci-joint). II n'y aurait a l'heure actuelle que 43 medecins dans
les centres existants. Ces 43 medecins pouvant Wtre redeployes dans les districts devront
Wtre completes par le recrutement de 25 m6decins supplementaires.
597 paramedicaux pour les 37 centres de sante (en y incluant ceux de Fatick et Kolda
non encore transformes en HR) et les 45 districts compares aux 624 paramedicaux
actuellement en place, laissant un exces global au niveau national de 27 SF et AS, en
acceptant que (a) IE et AS soient globalement interchangeables, moyennant un recyclage
eventuel, et (b) 48 paramedicaux dans les services des RM (10 IE) et GE (10 AS plus
18 AS pour les equipes mobiles) remplacent les 105 qui y travaillent actuellement.
A ce personnel, il faut ajouter celui en provenance d'un certain nombre de structures converties en poste
et en centre, et qui n'apparait pas dans les estimations utilisees ci-dessus; il sera disponible pour We
redeploye oti cela est necessaire.
Objectift de redoploiement/recrutement sur la periode 1990-95
11.           L'objectif prioritaire retenu privilegie la mise en place du reseau de 45 districts
sanitaires; cela exige donc de disposer du personnel suffisant pour les faire fonctionner ainsi que les 37
centres de reference et tous les postes existants ou a construire au fur et a mesure des possibilites de
construction et ainsi que la formation des nouveaux ICP.
12.           Un deuxibme objectif concerne la mise en oeuvre de plans de restructuration et gestion
du personnel pour toutes les structures de sante publique, autres que les districts Qes hopitaux bien sar,
mais aussi l'hygiene publique et les services specialises et administratifs) pour les rendre plus efficaces
et adaptees aux orientitions de la PNS, mais aussi aux ressources financieres I long terme du pays. Pour
cet objectif, on se cc -- e dans le projet PDRH A inclure un programme d'etudes pour preparer certalns
de ces plans de restr-. _ration, voir par. 17.
13.           En ce qui concerne le personnel medical necessaire au fonctionnement des districts, les
besoins regionaux sont resumes dans le Tableau 2 ci-joint. Les medecins presents dans la region et
susceptibles d'Otre integrEs dans une equipe de district ont ete selectionnes par la Direction de la sante
publique (DSP); on en deduit le nombre de MSP qu'il faut trouver en dehors des regions. Compte tenu
de la rarete en medecins, le MSPAS a examine tous les autres redeploiements possibles dans toutes les
structures autres que les districts avant  dEc 'der d'en recruter 25. De plus, d'ici 1995, 13 des 44

d/ Y compris les 28 WB/AS et 4 SF disponibles des deux hBpitaux de Dioum et Ourrossougi, qui sont converti.
15.            Apres redeploiement intra-regional au niveau des postes, centres, regions medicales et
grandes enddmies on peut estimer qu'il manque globalement 89 ICP, 17 WEAS et 4 SF combines mais
avec un excedent de 137 paramedicaux (dans lesquels 23 SF), ce qui devrait permettre de satisfaire en
priorite les manquants dans les regions ddficitaires; il y aurait donc un excedent global de 27
.naramedicaux. Ceci montre que le redeploiement pour satisfaire les normes de district peut s'effectuer
sans recrutement; neanmoins, ce redepleiement intra- et inter-regional pose plusieurs types de problemes
que le MSPAS aura I resoudre: (i) un probleme d'Equivalence entre les specialitds, pour savoir combien
d'AS peuvent Wtre utilisds comme ICP dans les postes et IE dans les centres; (ii) un probleme de
procddures de transfert inter-regional affectant surtout trois regions, celles de Saint-Louis, Tambacouda,
et Ziguinchor, puisque certains des positions oix l'on pourrait transferer le personnel en exces ne seront
disponibles qu'apres la construction des postes de sante prevus dans les autres regions; et (iii) un
probleme de conversion des structures specialisees en postes et centres, alors que l'on admis que ces
structures seraient alignees aux normes d'ici 1995 (cela se pose I Dakar et Saint-Louis et concerne des
medecins de centres et d'h6pitaux et des paramedicaux). En plus de la priorite donnee aux districts, on
notera qu'en ce qui concerne les HR, il y aurait un deficit important en paramddicaux (en acceptant les
normes retenues par le consultant, par.7); il faudra analyser au cas par cas comment le transfert de
certains paramedicaux pourraient aider a ameliorer les fonctions hospitalieres tout en gardant la priorite
I satisfaire les besoins des districts.
16.            En ce qui concerne le personnel autre que medical et paramedical dans les districts, son
redeploiement est evidemment plus complexe car il y a une plus grande heterogeneite entre les
qualifications existantes et celles qui seraient requises, en particulier dans les districts. Le rapport des
consultants propose un plan de redeploiement intra- et inter-regional pour satisfaire les normes pour les
centres et les h6pitaux. Ces propositions devront 8tre finalisees au niveau de chaque region en un



- 110 -
ANNEXE 3-7
Page 8 sur II
programme qui visera en priorite a fournir les 37 centres de sante. Ce redeploiement pose deux
problemes immediats:
(a) le premier concerne, dans les postes de sante, le personnel de soutien qui devrait etre redeploy6 ou
pris en charge progressivement par les comites de sante correspondants;
(b) le deuxieme concerne le personnel administratif qui devrait jouer un rOle croissant pour le
developpement des districts. Actuellement il y a un deficit enorme en personnel administratif si l'on
s'en tient aux classifications professionnelles; il est vraisemblable que du personnel de sante est utilise
pour ces fonctions. DMs 1991, un membre de l'equipe du district se verra confier les responsabilites
de gestionnaire-comptable, et il est important de prevoir un programme special pour garantir que les
besoins en formation de ce type seront bien pris en compte au niveau de chacun des districts; et
(c) pour les autres specialites, une comparaison grossiere entre le nombre de personnes concernees par
ces programmes et les besoins previsibles au niveau des centres montrent un excedent important qui
devrait donc permettre un redeploiement sans besoin de recourir I une reduction forcee d'effectifs,
moyennant une formation supplementaire, sur place sans doute; ce sera a prevoir dans le cadre du
PDDS.
17.           En ce qui concerne la gestion de l'ensemble du personnel du MSPAS, un programme
d'etudes sera mis en oeuvre, completant les contributions deja prevues des autres donateurs. Compte tenu
des problbmes deja evoques et la structure du MSPAS, le programme d'etudes do restructuration devra
s'articuler autour de quatre volets principaux:
- plan de developpement des hOpitaux regionaux. Le reseau prevu serait de 9 HR si on admet que les
centres de sante de Fatick et Kolda seront promus graduellement en HR. Comme deja mentionne,
les fonctions qu'un HR doit assure dans le contexte des nouvelles orientations de la PNS doivent 8tre
revues et detailldea. 11 en decoulera des besoins en personnel, equipement et charges recurrentes et
une nouvelle strategie de gestion; cette demibre est cruciale pour mettre en oeuvre le recouvrement
des coUts. II est recommande qu'un groupe de travail soit mis en place pour la negociation du projet
avec un donateur qui assure les appuis externes (a France par exemple accorde une grande priorite
aux HR). Le contenu de ce plan devrait 8tre disponible pour discussions un an aprbs.
- plan de developpement du CHU. Le meme dispositif est a prevoir, avec l'assistance d'un autre
donateur, la BAD etant interessee.
- plan de restructuration des services specialises. Compte tenu des services impliques dans le
redeploiement vers les districts, l'accent sera mis sur: (i) les autres services a caractere national -
- hygiene publique et medecine scolaire - tous deux aussi regionalises; et (ii) les services
specialises au nombre de huit, sachant que deux d'entre eux - PMI de la Medina et IHS - sont
integres dans le plan des huit districts de Dakar (para. 5). Ces services doivent 8tre reevalues
dans le but de: (i) diminuer les charges recurrentes, et donc la contribution requise du budget
du MSPAS; et (ii) les integrer autant que possible dans le systeme pyramidal de services qui est
mis en place.
-  restructuration et renforcement du MSPAS. L'Administration centrale de l'Etat fait l'objet d'un
programme de restructuration dans le cadre des programmes d'ajustement structurel et avec
l'assistance d'un projet finance par l'IDA.

Programme de redeploiement pour 1990-91
18.           Le bon ddmarrage du programme de promotion des districts de sante exige qu'un
personnel medical et paramddical y soit affecte immediatement, et donc qu'il soit en place, en particulier,
pour la mise ne vigueur du projet PDRH; ce personnel sera donc a redeployer d'abord a partir des
ressources regionales. Rappelons que les priorites de ce premier programme anruel de redeploiement
sont les suivantes: (i) constitution de l'quipe medicale des SSP autour du MCR et regroupant tous les
medecins de la region qui pourront participer au fonctionnement des districts de sante (para. I 1). Cette
approche devrait permettre la disponibilite d'un medecin pour devenir chef de district (MCD) et d'un
second medecin pouvant effectuer collEgialement avec le MCD la supervision des postes dans tous les 45
districts; et (ii) la disponibilite d'un ICP pour tous les postes existants qui seront maintenus. Le tableau
ci-joint resume ces besoins par regions. A cela, on peut ajouter qu'au niveau des HR (qui deviennent
centres de reference), la priorite sera donnee I leur fournir un chirurgien et un gynecologue.
19.           En ce qui concerne le personnel medical, il s'agira de reallouer des medecins
actuellement en fonction dans les centres (et les anciennes circonscriptions medicales), et les structures
qui dans chaque rEgion seront amenagees pour tenir compte des nouvelles normes uniformisees de
personnel dans les nouveaux districts et leurs centres de sante et/ou de reference. Ces structures incluent
les services regionaux autour du MCR, les services regionaux des grandes end6mies, et certaines
formations a reconvertir (telles que la PMI de la Medina et I'IHS dans la region de Dakar et les 2
hopitaux de N'Dioum et Ouroussogi dans celle de Saint-Louis). Apres examen des possibilites de
transfert, le MSPAS s'est engage I allouer 60 medecins actuellement en fonction aux 45 districts
nouvellement creds. Pour completer les 85 medecins gendralistes necessaires aux Equipes de ces 45
districts, le Gouvernement a inscrit 25 positions budgetaires pour le MSPAS dans la Loi de finances
1991-92; les recrutements seront complEtds avant decembre 1992.
20.           En ce qui concerne le personnel paramedical, il ne devrait pas y avoir d'obstacles k
satisfaire les besoins immediats au niveau des 565 postes existants qui sont conserves dans le plan des
districts a l'horizon 1995 (tableau 4 ci-joint). Pour les normes au niveau des centres, on a besoin en
priorite de 17 E/AS et de 4 SP, qui pourront etre aisement trouver dans les regions fortement
excedentaires (tableau 3).
21.           En ce qui concerne le Dersonnel administratif, le problbme est double (par. 16): on
manque de personnel forme, et on doit promouvoir ce type de qualifications dans les districts restructures.
On recommande donc de mettre en oeuvre un programme de renforcement du personnel administratif qui
comprendra:
un premier programme de formation sur place  Ce programme devra permettre de faire face k ces
besoins les plus urgents et definir comment convertir certains personnels avec un profil non
administratif b remplir ces tfches prioritaires. En particulier, on examinera comment former un
administrateur-comptable et un billeweur pour le centre, et un tresorier et un billeteur pour comite de
poste. Cette formation sera donnee des le demarrage des comites et reprise chaque annee dans une
reunion autour du MCD pour examiner l'execution du PDDS et des budgets.

une reflexion a long-terme sur les profils necessaires. Une telle dtude devrait: (a) examiner de fagon
plus ddtaillde mais dans un sch6ma global de gestion comment executer les taches administratives,
budgetaires et comptables du district; (b) definir les profils des postes correspondants dans la structure
des besoins en personnel du district; et (c) promouvoir une formation en administration de la sante
dans le systeme formel d'education et qui puisse r6pondre I ces besoins. Cette reflexion englobera
bien sftr les problemes rencontres au niveau des h8pitaux (par.6).
Programmation. suivi et contr6le
22.           Les programmes annuelles de redeploiement et recrutement sont donc definis en deux
phases: un plan d'urgence pour l'annee fiscale 1990-91, et un plan a moyen terme pour les anndes
fiscales 1991-92 a 1995-96. Le premier plan demande une reallocation du personnel pour (a) remplir 60
de 85 postes de medecins au niveau de district par le redEploiement du personnel; et recruter les 25
m6decins restants sur le budget de l'annde fiscale 1991-92; (b) satisfaire les besoins en paramedicaux pour
les 565 postes de sante existants a retenir sous les normes de couverture nouveaux et pour 37 centres de
sante; (c) doter touS les h8pitaux regionaux d'au moins un chirurgien et un gynecologue; et (d) nommer
ou identifier un agent administratif (peut8tre un paramedical, dans l'absence d'un administrateur form6)
pour chaque district. Ce plan devra impliquer: (a) le reddploiement de 20 mddecins vers les districts;
(b) le recrutement de 25 medecins supplementaires; (c) la formation de 565 ICP I partir des 732
paramedicaux actuellement dans des postes de sante (ou eventuellement dans des centres); et (d) le
reddploiement de paramedicaux vers les centres et districts. Le recrutement du personnel sanitaire est
protege dans certaines limites sous le programme de restructuration de la fonction publique du SAL IV,
et le recrutement propose ne depasserait pas ces limites.
23.           Le plan I moyen terme (1991-96) accorde la priorite aux actions suivantes:
(a) l'affectation d'un infirmier, sage-femme ou agent sanitaire I chaque nouveau poste de sante au fur et
I mesure de l'expansion; (b) le reddploiement du personnel de soutien au niveau du poste de santE, qui

REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Population and Health
Financing District Health Services
1.           This annex analyzes the operating costs of the district health system described in Annex
34, and their anticipated evolution over the five-year restructuring period of 1991-95, both at the level
of the individual facility as well as at the national level. It also proposes a financing scheme for
supporting operating costs, focusing mainly on government budget and user fee contributions, including
the role of community health organizations (CHOs). Although local governments are potential
contributors to the system, they are excluded from the analysis because there is not a strong tradition of
local governement contribution to operational costs in health in Senegal (except in Dakar) and significant
participation is not anticipated over the next few years. Except for replacement costs for vehicles at the
district level, which are included in the analysis, other costs of amortization on major investments
(infrastructure, equipment) are excluded; the assumption is that the international donor community would
continue to support the bulk of investment costs at least for the medium term. Focus is therefore given
to the flow-of-funds problem which has been plaguing health services in Senegal and preventing
improvements in service quality and coverage.
Halth Posts
2.           Qperatins Costs. The total operating costs of a health post (HP) would vary according
to the level of service utilization. At the low end of the scale, with utilizaion at 2,500 new cases per
year (as in the case of a health post located in a remote rural area with dispersed population), total cost
would be around 2.9 million CFAF per year, averaging 1,144 CPAF per episode (new case); at the upper
end, with utilization at 7,500 new cases per year (as in a fully functioning urban health post), total cost
would be 5.3 million CFAF per year, or 704 per episode. The average cost of drugs per episode would
be 280 CFAF. Table 1 shows these costs broken down by category of expenditure.
3.           Sources of Funds. Table 1 also proposes a financing plan for HPs. At this level, user
fees are expected to cover 100% of the cost of drugs and of salaries for support personnel (45% of total
cost, 76% of costs excluding the nurse's salary) plus a small proportion of other operating costs, with
Government budget allocations covering the nurse's salary and the bulk of other costs. Total user fee
contributions would amount .o 1-3 million CFAF per year per HP, for utilization rates of 2,500-7,500
episodes per year, and would correspond to an average client contribution of around 100 CFAP per
episode. This rate is higher than current rates of 250-350 CFAF but lies within wbat ie conriderad to
be affordable in Senegal.

Health Centers
4.            Operating Costs. Like for the health post, operating cost at the health center (HC) would
depend on the level of service utilization. In addition, the mix of cases served at the center (primary
consultations, referrals or hospitalizations) would also affect costs, in particular the cost of drugs. This
case mix has been observed to evolve significantly over a three-year period immediately following
restructuring of a health center, with primary consultations increasing dramatically at first then gradually
slowing down as services at the HP level improve. Table 2 shows the expected evolution in a health
center's costs after restructuring (for a center serving a population of 200,000). At the end of a three-
year transition period following restructuring, total operating costs would level off at 69.3 million CFAF
per year, of which 59% would go to salaries, 32% to drugs and 9% to other costs.
5.            Sources of Funds. Given the higher unit cost of services at the health center (HC) level,
the share of client contributions would be significantly less at this level than at the HP level, covering
only 5% of total cost (12% of costs excluding salaries) (see Table 2). These contributions would be
derived from fees to be charged for hospitalization (1000 CFAF per stay) and from laboratory fees (250
CFAF per exam); no fees would be charged for referral services. The balance of health center costs
(64.7 million after transition) would be supported by Governement, with the largest part of this assistance
going to salaries (63% of Government contribution) and the rest going to drugs (27%) and other costs
(9%).
District Management Services
6.               erating Cst. District management services consist of the managerial, admnistrative,
and supervisory responsibilities of the district management team. Principal cost elements include salaries
of the District Medical Officers, to the extent that some portion of their time Is applied to these tasks,
salaries for support staff, the logistical costs of supervision, and other routine operating costs. For
purposes of this annex, district doctors' salaries have been included under health center costs, except for
the seven regional capitals where there would be no health center (the regional hospital would serve as
the health center) and for the District of Oussouye which would not have a health center because of its
small population size. In the latter two cases, doctors' salaries are included in estimating costs of district
management services. Table 3 shows total operating cost for district management services. These would
total 5.0 million CFAF per district, excluding doctors' salaries.
7.            Sources gf Funds. It is recommended that all costs of district management services be
covered through Government budget contributions.
The District Health System
8.            Costs and Financing at the National Level. As shown in Table 4, the proposed district
health system, once in place (in 1995), would cost around 6.1 billion CFAF annually to operate: 3.4
billion (55%) for salaries, 1.8 billion (31 %) for drugs, and 0.9 (14%) billion for other costs. Health
posts would absorb 55% of total costs, health centers 41% and districtmanagement services 4%. These
estimates are based on a population size of 8.7 million, the projected population for 1995. They are also
based on assumptions of improved levels of utilization and operational efficiency as well as reductions
in drug prices to international market levels, conditions which are hoped to be in place after restructuring

of the sector during the period 1991-95. These assumptions are described in detail in Appendix 1 to this
annex.
9.           The aggregate financing plan for the district system is shown in Table 5. In 1995, after
the period of restructuring, user fees would cover 27% and Government contribution 73% of the total
cost of the district system. The bulk of user fee contributions (92%) would be made at the health post
level. Sixty-eight percent of Government allocation would go to salaries, 15% to drugs, and 17% to
other costs. Although a distinction is made between two non-salary categories (drugs and other costs)
in the above analysis, this distinction would, in the long-run, become more schematic than real. It is
expected that district resources from user fees and from government non-salary contributions would
eventually be managed as a combined pool, with allocational decisions made directly by district managers
(at the district/center as well as the post level) in conjunction with local health committees.
10.          Mobilizing Resources for the District System. It is estimated that a total of 4.3 billion
CFAF is currently available to fund the district system, from two principal sources: 4.0 billion from the
national budget (or 35% of total MOHSA budget allocation for FY90-91) and 0.3 billion from user fees.
Of this total, 3.3 billion would go to salaries, 0.6 billion to drugs, and 0.5 billion to other costs.
Comparing current funding levels with projected needs for FY95-96 would thus indicate a need to
increase the overall level of resources for the district system during the years 1991 to 1995 by 1.7 billion,
almost all of it needed for non-salary payments. The funding gap could be as much as twice that amount,
however, if no improvement in current drug prices and prescription practices are realized.
11.          The resource mobilization effort needed over the five-year period is shown in the table
below. The proposed scheme reflects consideration that has been given to the limited prospects for
budget expansion in the medium-term, as well as the large potential for increasing user fees, assuming
the right conditions prevail. Hence, it relies heavily on an increase in revenues from user fees, from 0.3
to 1.6 billion over the five-year period. While Government contribution to salary costs would decline
(on the assumption that necessary changes in current staff mix can be accomplished through appropriate
redeployment, hiring and dismissal - see Annex 3-7), non-salary allocations would have to increase from
0.9 billion to 1.4 billion.

12.          Community Health Organizations. The preceding sections have described how the
proposed resource mobilization will be accomplished at *he post and center levels with respect to user
fees. Under the proposed financing plan, client (or communu,y) contributions are essential to the
functioning of the HP, and the organizatic l of a local health committee to mobilize and manage the
required resources is a sine qua non for HP survival. In addition, sufficient resources must be mobilized,
whether from direct user fees or from other sources (local governments, etc.). If current practice of
relying on user fees continues, rates would need to increase to around 400 CFAF per episode. It must
be noted that the proposed fee structure is itself not as important as is the total financial contribution
expected from users (or the community). Hence, current practice of allowing local health committees
to set fees can be kept, with the caveat that total revenues should reach the levels specified above if the
post is to function properly. Alternative financing schemes such as insurance-type arrangements and/or
contributions from local governments could also eventually be considered.
13.          It is equally important that revenues earned from user fees are used appropriately, that
is: (a) channelled back into HP operations (and not hoarded or used for other 'projects") and (b)
allocated appropriately between drugs (at least 70% of revenues), salaries (around 25%), and other
recurrent items (around 5%). These elements will have to be included in the "contract" to be signed
between Government and the health committee.
14.          Given the relatively small contribution expected from clients at the HC level, there is less
justification for active participation of the local health association (Association pour la Sante) in resource
mobilization and management. It is therefore suggested that HC fees be collected and managed directly
by HC personnel. The health association (or the local government) may choore, however, to raise
supplementary resources to subsidize fac payments for all or select clients (e.g., lower-income clients)
or to improve service quality.
15.          Finally, there are imporant pre-conditions for realizing the over five-fold increase in user
fees hoped for over the next five ye-xs: supply of an initial stock of drugs at all district health facilities
to stimulate use of services and restore confidence in the system, application of new fee structures
simultaneousiy with the injection of &.x! supplies, appropriate training on service delivery and
management for health personnel, imprcved organization of health committees to facilitate resource
mobilization and to participate in manager -nt of funds. The present project would support policy
measures and investments to help satisfy tb*  a iove conditions.
16.          Budget allocations. With respect to budget allocations, the proposed total increase of 0.5
billion CFAF for non-salary costs over the five-year period would represent an annual increase of around
1% per year of current total MOHSA budget aVocations. If MOHSA's share of national budget allocation
were allowed to increase from its current level of 4.7% to around 7% by 1995 (the WHO-recommended
level is 10%), and assuming that the nationa! budget remains at least constant (in real terms), the 0.5
billion would represent no more than 10% of the total increase in MOHSA's budget and is hence clearly
affordable. The projectexd increase in MOHSA's budget would be in line with Government's stated policy
of prctecting social sector expenditures during the current period of budget restructuring, and is being
proposed under the ongoing Public Expenditure Review.
17.          The resource mobilization effort required of government during the period under
discussion involves not only increased budgetary allocations for the Sistrict, however, but also measures



- 118 -
ANNEX 3-
Page 5 of 8
to ensure that the full amounts allocated are actually made available at the district level. This would
involve an effort to facilitate actual transfers from Treasury through MOHSA, to the district level, and
to increase spending autonomy at tCiat level. Measures to correct existing constraints and permit budget
autonomy at the district level by 1992 would be undertaken under the proposed project.

APPENDIX
Aggregating Costs of the District System at the National Level'
1.           This appendix explains the assumptions used in estimating the aggregate operating cost
of the district sys m over the period 1991-95. They reflect, to a large extent, assumptions made about
the phasing in of restructuring efforts planned during this period as well as the expected effectiveness -
in terms of resulting improvements in functionality - resulting from these efforts.
2.           Health Posts. For purposes of estimating aggregate costs at the national level health post
are classified into four categories, each with an assumed level of utilization: functional urban HPs (7,500
new cases per year), functional HPs in densely populated rural areas (5,000 NC per year), functional HPs
in dispersed rural areas (2,500 NC per year), and non-restructured or restructured but non-functional HPs
(2,500 NC per year). Estimates are made on the assumption that the restructuring of health posts would
be completed over a period of five years, phased in (schematically) as follows: for each district, 3 HPs
in 1991, 4 in 1992 and 5 each in 1993-95. Based on experience in Senegal and in other African
countries, it is expected that 50% of restructured HPs would become fully functional, with the rest
remaining at low operational levels either because of a weak health post nurse or an unmotivated
community. In the case of success, the transition to full functionality could occur within a year of
restructuring. Appendix Table 1.1 shows the expected evolution in numbers of HPs, by category, based
on demographic projections, the above restructuring program and an expected success rate of 50%.
3.           Appendix Tables 1.2 and 1.3 show, respectively, the annual recurrent costs and financing
plan for all health posts for the years 1991-95. By 1995, the aggregate of HPs would cost 3.3 billion
CFAF to operate, of which user fees would finance 38% (65% if the nurse's salary is excluded). Note
that this plan implies a large investment in construction of new HPs which number 656 at present and
would have to increase to over 900 by 1995 to ensure complete coverage. This applies in particular in
urban areas, where HP construction is a high priority investment need.
4.           Health Centers. Aggregate cost and financing at the national level for the period 1991-95
would be determined by anticipated increases in district-level population and the timing of the HC
restructuring program. Restructuring of all health centers would take place during the first year of
implementation of the proposed project. Hence, the transition period for all HCs would be underway
during the years 1991-94, stabilizing at "steady state" operational levels starting in 1994. On the
'Tke aggregate financing plan presented in this Appendix is based on the district system discussed
at the time of appraisal, i.e., 34 centers and 42 districts. At negotiations, it was agreed that for
political and geographical reasons the number of centers would be increased to 37 and the number of
districts to 45 (see Annex 3-4 for details). However, Government agreed that personnel and
budgetary norms would be reduced for four districts that had been created by the splitting of two
previous ones, keeping total recurrent cost requirements for these four districts equal to those of two
"standard" districts. In practical terms this means that the overall costs and financing of the district
system at the national level would increase by only one health center and one district team or around
two percent of the total presented here. There is no change in the number of health posts.

financing side, because they involve the installation of new tarrif systems and generally more expensive
services, it is also assumed that cost recovery mechanisms would be in place only after a period of
transition. For purposes of this annex, cost recovery at the HC level is assumed to be 25% functional
(on average) in 1991-92, 50% functional in 1993-94, and 75% functional in 1995 and thenceforth.
Finally, increases in the average population size per district over the period 1991-95 would affect not only
non-salary costs but also the number of doctors required in a district. By 1995, 13 districts in the country
would have populations exceeding 250,000 and hence would need a third doctor. To simplify the
analysis, salary costs for the 13 "third" doctors are added in lump-sum in 1995.
5.           The aggregate financing plan for all health centers has been projected as shown in
Appendix Table 1.4. The aggregate of HCs would cost 2.5 billion CFAF to operate by 1995, of which
60% would be for salaries, 32% for drugs and 9% for other costs. Under the proposed financing plan,
user fees would finance 5% of total cost (12% excluding salaries).
6.           District Management Services. Appendix Table 1.5 shows aggregate recurrent costs for
all district management services, aggregated for the 34 districts outside the regional capitals, the seven
regional capitals, and the District of Oussouye.

REPUBLIOUE DU SENEGAL
PROJET DE DEVELOPPEMENT DES RESSOURCES HUMAINES
Population et Sante
Reforme de la Pharmacie nationale d'aprovisionnement
I.    Background
1.           Le secteur pharmaceutique du Senegal est caractdris6 par un secteur prive tres developp6
et dynamique et un secteur public en perte de vitesse et peu efficient. La production locale est assur6e
par deux unit6s:
La SIPOA qui produit une containe de produits gen6riques, ava{t obtenu un monopole de
fait de la fourniture au secteur public pour les produits qu'elle fabrique. Elle cherche I
fabriquer davantage de sp6cialites destines au secteur prive. L'Etat qui y est un
actionnaire minoritaire se desengage au profit de pharmaciens priv6s.
PARKEDAVIS quant I lui ne produit que des specialites.
Le secteur commercial comprend trois grossistes importateurs et environ 120 pharmacies implantees
principalement en zone urbaine et 140 d6p6ts pharmaceutiques tenus par des commergants sous la tutelle
des officines. Le secteur public est constitu6 par la Pharmacie Nationale d'Approvisionnement (PNA)
qui est chargee d'alimenter I'ensemble des formations sanitaires publiques et r6pond en partie aux besoins
des organisations communautaires de sante.
2.           Les m6dicaments sont vendus I des prix fixes selon le bareme suivant: frais d'importation
de 13% du prix de base, une marge du grossiste de 22% du prix de revient et une marge du detaillant
de 48,5% du prix de vente soit le double du prix d'achat hors taxe. Une marge reduite de 9,9% et 9%
respectivement est appliquede  un certain nombre de medicaments de la liste sociale. Cette marge
destinee theoriquement I favoriser la distribution, a eu un effet contraire, car peu incitative a la vente,
ce qui a limite la diffusion des produits de la liste sociale.
3.           Faute de moyens suffisants, I'Etat ne parvient plus a prendre en charge l'ensemble des
besoins pharmaceutiques des formations sanitaires et la participation des communautes au coftt du
medicament ne permet pas I l'heure actuelle de couvrir ces besoins. A l'insuffisance des ressources
s'ajoute la defaillance du systeme d'approvisionnement. Des r6gimes de distribution occupent une part
non negligeable des approvisionnements, il existe une multiplicite de dons et un marche illicite se
developpe, difficile I estimer, mais porteur de risque en terme de sante publique.

II.    Contraintes et difficultes du secteur pharmaceutilque
4.            Les difficultes du secteur pharmaceutique sont un des elements des problemes que traverse
d'une manibre generale le systeme sanitaire senegalais. En effet, le Senegal connaft depuis les anndes
quatre-vingts une degradation de l'acces des populations aux soins de sante primaires due en particuller
a une reduction en termes reels des ressources des services de sante et d'une defaillance du systeme de
gestion de ces ressources et leur utilisation inefficiente. Cette situation a affecte la credibilit6 des
formations sanitaires qui ne delivrent pratiquement plus de medicaments aux patients, surtout les
populations les plus demunies qui ne parviennent pas 4 honorer les prescriptions qu'ils recoivent en raison
de leur coat dans les officines privees.
5.            La participation financibre des populations qui pouvait constituer un complement au
budget de i'Etat n'est pas suffisamment mobilisee dans le systeme sanitaire, faute de prestations crEdibles
marquees par des penuries frequentes de medicaments; parfois quand ils existent, leur gestion par les
formations sanitaires est defectueuse. Apres avoir atteint 400 millions de FCFA en 1985, les montants
de la participation sont passes a 210 millions en 1987. La part consacree aux mddicaments dans le
systame de participation des populations (50% des ressources declarees) no progresse pas et au mOme
moment on remarque un glissement des depenses des comites de sante vers la prise en charge des salaires
de personnel et une derive par rapport aux objectifs de co-gestion pour les soins de sante primaires. Face
h cette limitation des ressources et l'augmentation du prix du medicament, on constate une baisse du
pouvoir d'achat trbs sensible du budget.
6.            L'utilisation et les prescriptions irrationnelles des mddicaments plus orientees sur les
produits de marque plutot que sous leur forme generique resultent d'un manque de formation des
prescripteurs non sensibiises aux medicaments essentiels (ME) et d'autre nart du manque d'information
objective sur les medicaments.
7.            Le systeme public d'approvisionnement et de distribution de medicaments est deficient
et occasionne de frequentes penuries dues en grande partie aux difficultes financibres de la PNA et aux
contraintes qui pbsent sur celle-ci. Ces contraintes sont liWes I son fnctionnment administratif,  son
organisation et I la nature de son activite. L'execution des d6penses de la PNA se fait selon la procedure
des bons d'engagements, liquidation et palement pour ses differents fournisseurs et creanciers. La PNA,
service public rattache au ministere de la Sante, fonctionne selon les rbgles rigoureuses mais lentes de
l'administration; cette lenteur affecte son systeme d'approvisionnement mis au compte des procEdures
d'acquisition imposees au secteur public avec de regulibres ruptures de stock; des paiements hors delais
contractuels qui rendent la PNA tributaire de ces fournisseurs qui lui accordent des credits longues-durees
et en majorant leur prix de vente du coat des financements. Malgr6 les efforts recents de paiement de
sa dette, la PNA tratne encore des arridres de paiements qui remontent d'avant 1986. Le desistement de
certains fournisseurs du fait de ces anomalies a rEduit les possibilites de la PNA de recourir I une
concurrence plus large pour son approvisionnement.
8.            Les procedures d'achat utilisees font peu appel I la concurrence, cependant elles ont
gagne en efficacite en raison de l'am1lioration du paiement des fournisseurs. Pour les mddicaments
g6nEriques qu'elle fabrique, la SIPOA est le fournisseur exclusif de la PNA (en vertu d'une convention
pass6e avec l'Etat), ce qui represente le marche le plus important de la PNA (44%). En ce qui concerne
les autres produits, les appels a la concurrence sont diffuses pour une consultation des fournisseurs, ce
qui permet une comparaison des offres destinees I orienter le choix des fournisseurs. Pour des produits

ANNIE 3-9
Page 3 sur 10
k foumisseurs exclusifs, des marches directs de gre k gre sont passes (ce qui represente la plupart des
produits qui ne sont pas traites sous DEnomination Commune Internationale (DCI), et sont achetds sous
nom de marque).
9.           En ce qui concerne les prix d'achat, la comparaison des prix de quelques medicaments
essentiels (1988) obtenus par contrat de gre I gre avec ceux obtenus sur appel d'offre par un pays voisin
fait apparaltre des differences allant de 30 k 150%  (ex. Diazpam, chloroquine, mebendazole,
gentamycine, phenobarbital, metronidazole, isoniazide, etc.). On peut donc s'attendre I realiser des
economies significatives par l'application d'une politique d'acquisition plus appropriee.
10.          Malgre la disponibilite de moyen de stockage, le systeme reste peu efficace. Le nombre
de references (environ 830 references codees) et la multiplicite des produits en stock obsolete est un
facteur de dispersion qui ne simplifle pas le suivi et la gestion des produits.
II.          Pour la distribution des m6dicaments aux formations sanitaires, la PNA fonctionne selon
plusieurs circuits financiers et administratifs ceci pour differents services du secteur de la sante et les
autres services de l'Etat comme les lycees et l'armee. Ces differents circuits se tradulsent par des
procEdures et des controles divers pour chacun, ce qui complique de maniere tout k fait inutile. Le circuit
de paiements effectu6s par les comites de sant6 est plus direct mais ces recettes echappent k la PNA au
profit du tresor public; ainsi on ne parvient pas I recycler ses ressources dans l'achat de medicaments.
12.          Enfin les effectifs ne sont pas stables, il existe un probleme aigu de motivation pour les
pharmaciens qui ne restent pas dans le secteur public.
13.          Par ailleurs, le secteur prive, malgre son dynamisme, en couvrant 94% du march6 des
medicaments, ne s'intdresse pas encore aux mddicaments sous forme g6nerique qui rdpond aux besoins
de la majorite de la population I faible revenu. Les pharmacies et ddpOts restent concentres en milieu
urbain et les medicaments sont peu accessibles en zone rurale par ce reseau.
14.          Le Gouvernement a adopte en septembre 1989 une politique nationale de sante qui
accorde la priorite aux soins de santE primaires. Cette politique consacre une place importante a la
promotion de medicaments essentiels feront l'objet d'une liste. officielle adoptee par l'Etat sous forme
d'arrete et acceptable par l'IDA. Aussi est-il prevu le renforcement de leur systeme d'approvisionnement
et de distribution. C'est dans cc contoxte que se situe la rEforme de la PNA.
m.   Objectifs et stratWgie de la r_forme de la PNA
A.    Objectifs et contexte de la rdforme
15.          L'analyse de la situation a mis en evidence la defaillance des systemes actuels k assurer
une accessibilite suffisante de la majorite de la population aux medicaments. Cela se traduit par une
couverture pharmaceutique limitEe et une situation de penurie au sein des formations sanitaires publiques.
16.          La reforme de la PNA procede de la strategle globale de promouvoir une grande
utilisation et une constante disponibilite de ME. Elie s'accompagnera donc de la formation des
prescripteurs k l'usage des ME et d'une vaste campagne aupres des prescripteurs et du public. La mise
en place de pharmacies de districts et leur gestion amElioree dans le cadre des programmes de



- 130 -
ANNE-9
Page 4 sur 10
renforcement des districts (cf. Annexe 3-4) constitueront un appoint a la reforme.
17.           La PNA en tant que structure publique dolt assurer I'approvisionnement du secteur
sanitaire public en medicamenu. et produits essentiels (PE) correspondants aux listes nationales, de
maniere regulieres et fiables et a moindre coGt, en s'adaptant a une demande evolutive des differentes
formations sanitaires. Pour cette raison, la PNA doit parvenir I une autonomie d'actions lui permettan;
de fonctionner comme un grossiste repartiteur conforme I son activite commerciale d'achat et de
distribution de ME, mais coherent avec ses objectifs sociaux et non lucratifs. Elle doit concilier les
imperatifs de gestion privee et les devoirs de sa mission d'interet general. Son activite se limitera aux
ME et PE dont elle n'aura cependant pas l'exclusivite (e secteur prive pourra distribuer ces prodults).
Elle aura libre acces au marche international en faisant jouer la concurrence nationale.
18.           Ses moyens de fonctionnement seront finances grace k l'application d'une marge
forfaitaire, pour un premier temps, sur le prix d'achat et qui lui assure au moins la couverture de ses
colts d'acquisition, de stockage et de distribution. Ce principe conduira pour le cas des formations
sanitaires publiques I budgetiser des credits evaluatifs pour chaque exercice en tenant compte de cette
marge. La PNA tiendra des comptes separds pour chaque client important et chaque district pour suivre
la consommation des credits alloues a chaqaie formation. Au dell du reseau de la PN4, la logistique et
la gestion du medicament reviendra aux clients concernes.
19.           Quant au secteur prive, il pourrait servir de support k la distribution de medicaments
essentiels, a condition qu'il soit incite a le faire et qu'il y trouve son intere. En effet l'achat au niveau
international k des prix competitifs de medicaments generiques est en 'contradiction" avec le mecanisme
de fixation des prix de vente qui tend a favoriser l'achat du medicament le plus cher (cf. para 2).
20.           A l'heure actuelle, et selon une logique commerciale, le secteur priv6 vend principalement
des produits de marque plus onereux que les medicaments generiques et donc plus remunerateurs puisque
le systeme de remuneration est 1H6 I la marge. On pourrait imaginer que, danm le cadre de la politique
de medicaments essentiels, les grossistes importent des medicaments generiques dont le prix d'achat est
beaucoup plus faible que les produits de marques equivalents. Mais si on maintient une remuneration
liee k une marge en %, les pharmacies et les grossistes ne seront pas incites k distribuer des ME moins
remunerateurs a marge 6gale et d'autant plus si elle est diminude. II faudrait donc proposer un systeme
de remuneration qui assure un revenu egal par ME en valeur absolue aux produits de marque equivalents
et qui aboutit I un prix public de vente moins eleve. On peut donc envisager un systeme de fixation des
prix diff oents qui, conformement aux objectifs lucratifs du secteur, favorise davantage la distribution de
medicam, its gdneriques, moins chers pour le consommateur, tout en rdpondant a l'inter&t recherch6 par
les distributeurs. Cependant, it existe des limites, voire des obstacles, I ce type de solution liEs
principalement:
au problbme 6thique que souleve l'application de marges deux fois plus importantes sur
les medicaments essentiels que sur les autres produits au nom d'un objectif strictement
commercial;
a l'implantation geographique directement liee I la rentabilit6 et au pouvoir d'achat, ce
qui reduit la disponibilite;
a la pression des laboratoires fjurnisseurs sur les prescripteurs et les grossistes

importateurs. La puissance marketing des laboratoires de produits de marque est en effet
trbs superieure a celle des fournisseurs de generiques de taille en general plus petite;
-     a l'absence de regulation par le consommateur qui n'intervient pas directement sur la
demande (d'oft le poids des prescripteurs); il n'y a pas en fait de concurrence reelle.
21.          Compte tenu de ces dlements et de la difficulte de mettre en place des controles qui soient
reelloment efficaces, il y a un risque rdel de derive par rapport a une politique de ME. Et contrairement
a d'autres biens de consommation et aux lois habituelles du marche, la liberalisation du marchE des
medicaments et le developpement de la concurrence n'entratnent pas une baisse des prix pour le
consommateur. II sera men6 dans le cadre du PDRH (Population et Sante) une etude sur la strategie I
long terme de la distribution de Medicaments essentiels, qui examinera toutes les voies possibles
d'approvisionnement des formations sanitaires en ME/PE y compris par le secteur prive.
B.    RMforme de la PNA
22.          La reforme de la PNA vise a creer les conditions lui permettant d'avoir une souplesse
d'intervention par la mise en oeuvre des mesures et actions identifiees ci-dessus. Una vision du rOle
particulier que doit jouer la PNA a long terme dans une strategie globale de promotion de ME demande
une reflexion encore plus approfondie. Pour cela, la PNA sera maintenue, pour une phase transitoire
d'au moins trois ans, comme service administratif de l'Etat avec une relative autonomie de
fonctionnement.
23.          Les conditions pour garantir cette autonomie sont essentiellement de trois ordres:
-'acces immediat et regulier aux fonds budgetaires alloues a l'achat de ME par
I'amenagement des modalites et procedures de paiement en vigueur;
-     l'accroissement et la diversification des ressources en dehors de l'Etat;
-     la mise en place d'une structure fonctionnant de facon performante et adaptee k la mission
de la PNA par la modification des procedures d'acquisition des medicaments et la
restructuration interne de la PNA.
24.          Pour permettre l'acces facile aux fonds, reduire les delais de paiemer: st ameliorer les
condidons d'approvisionnement de la PNA par une plus grande participation de fournisseurs, il sera
ouvert deux comptes bancaires: l'un recevra les fonds destines aux formations sanitaires et sera alimente
pour un montant initial de 350 millions de FCFA; pour le reapprovisionner, la PNA soumettra au
Ministere de l'Economie, des Finances et du Plan (MEFP) au moins tous les trois mois les pibces
justificatives pour les paiements effectues, le MEFP s"engageant I reapprovisionner ce compte A
maximum un mois anres le depOt de ces pifces justificatives. Le second recevra directement les recettes
provenant de la participation des comitEs de sante et autres clients hors Etat.
25.          La separation de ces comptes procede du souci da conserver au niveau de la PNA les
ressources nees de la participation des populations et permettre ainsi d'apprecier leur Evolution. Le
Directeur de la PNA sera l'administrateur des credits charge d'engager les depenses selon le plan annuel
d'utilisation arr8te dans le programme de la PNA; et les fonctions d'ordonnateur des palements resteront

devolues au MEFP.
26.          11 a ete accord6 a la PNA une derogation aux procedures de passation de marches publics
pour les annees 1991-94. Des procedures d'achat de ME seront basees sur la constitution d'une
commission speciale de marches du medicament composee de representants designes du MSPAS et du
MEFP, faisant recours I (i) des conditions de preselection des soumissionnaires autorises I participer aux
appels d'offres et de publication des offres en utilisant la denomination commune internationale (DCI)
pour les ME; et (ii) aux criteres techniques et financiers de choix de fournisseurs et selon les delais
habituellement requis en matiere d'appel I la concurrence internationale. Des procedures de passation
des marches sont recommandees a l'Appendice B; le Gouvernement doit les finaliser en accord avec
l'IDA avant la premiere requete de d6boursement pour des medicaments sur le credit IDA.
27.          La dette de la PNA d'avant 1986, d'un montant de 365 millions de FCFA, sera apurde
durant les exercices budgetaires 1990/91 et 1991/92. Les mesures suivantes de restructuration interne
de la PNA sont arr8tees:
(a)    Un texte reglementaire sera pris, rattachant la PNA au cabinet du Ministere de la Sante Publiqqe
et de l'Action Sociale; les Pharmacies Regionales d'Approvisionnement (PRA) releveront
hierarchiquement de la PNA de facon I recentrer leur role de succursale pour cette dernibre,
plutot que de dependre de l'autorite sanitaire regionale qui peut Otre tentee de leur assigner des
activites en dehors de la mission de la PNA. L'organigramme de la PNA sera adaptd I ses
nouvelles fonctions de management, d'achat, de stockage, de distribution, clients et de contrfle
de gestion. L'organisation de ses activitds et les procedures decrites par l'etude figurent en
Appendice A. Les effectifs seront quantitativement et qualitativement ajustes dans le cadre du
Plan de redeploiement du personnel du Ministbre de la Sante Publique et de l'Action Sociale. Le
projet recrutera I titre exceptionnel, le personnel dont le profil no sera pas trouv6 suite I ce
red6ploiement tel que le contrOleur de gestion et les pharmaciens manquants.
(b)    Une comptabilit6 commerciale, conformEment au plan comptable en vigueur au S6n6gal, sena
mise en place en liaison avec la comptabilite budgetaire. 1 sera 6labore un guide de procddure
de fonctionnement dont la mise en oeuvre embrassera toutes les fonctions de la PNA et sera
concu de manibre evolutive pour s'adapter I son activit6. Ces deux mesures seront r6alis6es avec
l'aide d'assistances techniques specialisees charg6es d'aider I la conception et I I'exEcution par
un processus interactif et une formation in situ destines I l'appropriation par le personnel de la
PNA de ces nouveaux outils. I1 est par ailleurs pr6vu l'informatisation de ces procedures.
(c)    Le stock de m6dicaments p6rimes de la PNA sera reforme et le stock restant ajust6 pour le rendre
conforme aux listes de ME et PE des la premiere annEe du programme et l'adapter
progressivement a la demande des formations sanitaires. Les co8ts n6s des prestations offertes
par la PNA dans la gestion des dons et programmes sp6cifiques seront supportes par lea structures
ayant initie ces activites. Pour les spdcialites des hOpitaux, la PNA fera des commandes
specifiques et separees des ME et la gestion de ces stocks ser assuree par les h6pitaux memos.

IV.   Conditionnalites, calendrier et indicateur de rdalisation
(voir tableaux ci-joints)
28.          La PNA, par la mise en oeuvre des mesures de restructuration identifiee ci-dessus afin
d'atteindre les objectifs vises (cf. para. 17) doit durant la periode que couvre le programme parvenir h
la situation suivante:
echapper au d6ficit de tresorerie que lui impose I'Etat et disposer d'une tresorerie
autonome qui evoluera selon les estimations des recettes et ddpenses present6es au
Tableau 2 en annexe. Cette evolution favorable sera rendue possible d'une part par la
prise en charge par le projet du financement du stock initial de mddicament pour la PNA
et les formations sanitaires et d'autre part du d6veloppement de la participation des
populations a la prise en charge d'une partie du codt des medicaments. Cette participation
de l'ordre de 20% en 1989 pourrait atteindre 45% des recettes de la PNA en 1993 et
52% en 1994 et 58% a la fin du programme.
Cependant, la viabilite financibre de la PNA restera tributaire du niveau de prix de vente du m6dicament.
En l'absence de donnees comptables flables sur les co(ts d'exploitation de la PNA due au defaut d'un
systeme comptable analytique et commercial, il n'est pas possible de disposer d'une politique de prix
basee sur une structure tarifaire 6labor6e a partir des do;n6es comptables m8me si la PNA ne prend pas
en charge tous les coOts du fait encore de son statut de service administratif. En attendant de mener dans
le cadre du programme une etude sur le recouvrement des coats et les taux de marge applicable au
medicament, il a ete retenu d'appliqu Xr une marge forfaitaire de 5% sur les prix d'achat des medicaments;
suite a une analyse pr6liminaire, cette marge ne couvrira que les frais d'acquisition des medicaments.
Le budget de l'Etat continuera a supporter pour la p6riode transitoire de restructuration, les frais de
personnel, de gestion (eau, electricite, tElephone) et de transport pour un montant annuel moyen de 40
millions FCFA (cf. Tableau 4).
29.          La PNA doit parvenir au cours du programme a couvrir progressivement ces charges pour
l'instant supportdes par le budget tout en equiibrant ses recettes et ses charges d'exploitation. Selon les
hypotheses d'evolution des recettes et les charges d'exploitation retenues dans la limite des previsions
budgetaires, le compte d'exploitation ddgagera un resultat positif I partir de la troisibme annEe du
programme et restera equilibr6 les annees suivantes.
30.          Toutefois, a cet horizon une modification du statut de la PNA vers une autonomie
conduirait I une variation de charges k la hausse dont la couverture dependra du niveau de tarif a adopter
suite I l'Etude sur le recouvrement des cofts. Une evaluation au bout de la 3e annee est necessaire pour
apprecier l'impact des mesures prEconisees et proposer des correcdf si necessaires pour atteindre les
objectifs de restructuration de la PNA.
31.          Le tableau ci.-aprbs constitue les actions a mettre en oeuvre avant l'entr6e en vigueur du
projet et durant la premiere ann6e d'ex6cution. Ces actions seront confort6es au fur et I mesure quo la
PNA atteindra sa montee en puissance, sur la periode du programme. Tout au long de cette mise en
oeuvre dans le cadre du suivi et de l'Wvaluation du PDRH (cf. Annexe 4-4) les points suivants seront
revus pour appr6cier les conditions de succes de la r6forme de la PNA:
les conditions d'Etablissement et de mise a jour de la liste des

Le Directeur de la PNA est charg6 de 1'ex6cution de ces actions et assurera leur coordination avec l'unitE
d'administration du PDRH et les autres volets de la composante sant6.
V. Contenu et rEsum6 des coats
32.          Le projet financera principalement le stock initial de ME tant au niveau des districts que
pour l'ajustement du stock existant au niveau de la PNA. II sera fait appel aux services de spdcialistes
pour la mise en place des outils de gestion, la formation du personnel. Enfin, il sera procdde I de legers
travaux d'amenagements et d'6quipements des locaux et des Etudes complementaires portant sur le
recouvrement des coOts et une strategie k long terme de distribudon de ME au Senegal. Le coot total de
la composante non compris la formation des prescripteurs et les campagnes d'information et les Etudes
sur le d6veloppement d'une strategie I long terme est de 1.119 millions de FCPA dont 875 millions
destiiiEs k l'acquisition de ME at 101,8 millions de coOts recurrents.

Organisation des principales activites de la PNA 1/
1.           Le fonctionnement de la PNA doit s'appuyer sur la simplification et la rationalisation des
procedures, et sur l'utilisation de documents appropries dans l'objectif d'une efficacit6 maximale.
1.    Les proe6dures d'achats
2.           La fonction d'acquisition est primordiale, son efficacite est fonction de plusieurs dl6ments:
I) la centralisation d'un nombre limite de ME et PE
correspondant aux besoins (et I la demande),
ii) Ia connaissance du marche international,
iii) la capacite de payer les fournisseurs.
(a)    Ddfinition des begoins
3.           La premiere etape consist. I quantifier les besoins sur la base des nomenclatures de
reference (issues des listes de ME et PE) en fonction des elements suivants: les donnees de
consommation, les parametres d'approvisionnement, les niveaux de stocks et l'expression des besoins des
clients. Un systeme de collecte de ces donnees sera progressivement mis en place (y compris au niveau
des PRA) et l'exploitation de ces donn6es pourra ttoe informatisee I la PNA.
4.            Ce travail aboutira I 1'6tablissement d'une liste de prevision I partir de laquelle se feront
les achats et sera programme un plan d'approvisionnement.
(b)    Acquisition
5.           Pour mieux orienter les achats sur le marche international il sera necessaire d'etablir un
systeme de recensement et de mise I jour d'informations commerciales concernant : les produits en
generique, les producteurs/fournisseurs de generiques, les tendances du marche international, les indices
de prix, etc.
6.            Les techniques d'achat devront faire intervenir la concurrence et utiliserontdes procedures
speciales d'appels d'offres internationaux ou restreints selon les produits (voir Appendice B pour les
D[.fiMres rewmmandie qui devront 8tre finalisees avant deboursement des fonds prevus par le credit
pour des achats de medicaments). Cela inclut la preselection des soumissionnaires, l'utilisation des DCI
(denomination commune internationale), et l'achat de generiques. Par ces procedures une economie

substantielle (de l'ordre de 30%) pourra Qtre rda1is6e par rapport aux achats actuels.
7.           La nature sp6cifique des produits pharmaceutiques impliquera la redaction d'un cahier
des charges sp6cifiques dont les clauses devront etre definies en vue de garantir une qualite conforme aux
normes usuelles pharmaceutiques (identification des fournisseurs, peremption denomination, qualite
pharmaceutique ...).
8.           Le recours au systbme de certification de l'OMS doit Otre utilise pour permettre la
selection des soumissionnaires et l'achat de gendrique, en attendant que le Laboratoire National de
controle puisse prendre le relais en ce qui concerne certains aspects du controle de qualite.
(c)    Approvisionnement
9.           Les commandes seront planifiees selon une periodicite etablie en fonction des delais
d'approvisionnement et des niveaux de stock. Contrairement au fonctionnement actuel de type centrale
d'achat, la PNA approvisionnera les clients a partir d'un stock, ce qui suppose la detention et la gestion
d'un stock permanent suffisant pour repondre a la demande.
10.          Le suivi de toutes les procedures administratives liees aux approvisionnements et aux
livraisons (importation, dedouanement, transit, etc..) est indispensable pour raccourcir les delais
d'execution.
(d)    Modalite de paiement
11.          II est primordial de pouvoir assurer vis-a-vis des fournisseurs des garanties de paiement
dans des delais acceptables, sous peine de perdre la confiance des fournisseurs et de connaltre les m8mes
difficultEs que par le passe. Dans ce contexte, le MEFP a accepte de garantir le reapprovisionnement
du compte bancaire de la PNA au maximum 1 mois apres la soumission par la PNA des pieces
justificatives.
12.          Pour cela, il est prevu que la trdsorerie soit un element de base de controle de gestion.
2.    Gestion phvsique des stocks
13.          L'organisation des magasins de la PNA devra etre revisee afin d'ameliorer les conditions
de stockage, d'optimiser la rotation des stocks (regle FIFO) et de suivre le niveau des stocks grace I une
gestion physique et comptable rigoureuse. En particulier les stocks perimes seront reformes et une
methode de rangement plus rationnelle sera adoptee.
14.          L'organisation devra permettre en outre une circulation logique des flux (circuit d'entrEe
et de sortie des produits), et un deroulement fonctionnel des operations (zone de preparation, zone de
vdrification, zone de conditionnement, etc.).
15.          Un modble de gestion sera generalise sur la base de methode classique (codification,
fiches de stocks, etc) et un systbme informatique d'exploitation simple sera installe utilisant les ordinateurs
existant a la PNA en attendant l'acquisition d'unites supplementaires fournies par le projet pour
l'informatisation integrale des differentes fonctions de la PNA. L'ensemble des procedures et des

documents correspondants sera mis au point et redige par ecrit.
16.          Par ailleurs les conditions de surveillance et de sdcurite des magasins devront Wtre
renforcees.
17.          Les memes regles d'organisation seront appliquees aux PRA.
3.    Proc6dures de distribution
18.          Cette activite sera organis6ee en fonction de la demande des clients. Les commandes seront
exprimees sur des documents preimprimes, traitees par le departement client et preparees au niveau des
magasins selon un planning et une periodicite "tablie en accord avec le client.
19.          La logistique de livraison dependra des systemes retenus, et des moyens seront prevus
pour conditionner les commandes preparees dans les magasins.
20.          Des documents appropries devront etre mis au point (bordereau de commande, de
preparation, de livraison, de facturation) I l'aide des moyens informatiques disponibles. Ceci afin de
simplifier les procedures actuelles et dans un souci d'efficacite et de fiabilitE maximum.

APPENDICE B
Procedures recommandees pour la passation des marches de medicaments essentiels
1.           La passation des marches pour les medicaments essentiels est un peu plus complexe que
celle des autres biens et services financEs par le Projet, car des criteres specifiques pour garantir la
conformite des medicaments fournis aux imperatifs de qualite doivent etre definis et maintenus tout au
long du processus de selection, d'achat et de reception des commandes. Les procedures qui sont
recommandees dans cette annexe devront atre conformes aux recommandations de l'OMS et aux
Directives de l'IDA pour les passations des marches faisant appel a la concurrence Internationale et seront
donc finalisees avec leur assistance.  Les deux elements importants de ces procedures sont:
(i) I'etablissement et la mise a jour d'une liste unique de pr6-selection de "fournisseurs" en medicaments
essentiels; et (ii) l'utilisation de specifications des medicaments en denomination commune internationale.
2.           Selection des fournisseurs. Elle comprend deux phases: la pr6-selection des fournisseurs
et le suivi en continu de leurs performances. L'execution rigoureuse de ces deux phases est la meilleure
garantie d'etablir un systeme efficace de contrBle de qualite dans le contexte du Senegal. La selection
sera limitee aux producteurs primaires de medicaments puisque le principal critbre de qualit6 sera la
conformite avec laquelle ce producteur respecte les "Bonnes Pratiques Industrielles" telles qu'elles sont
definies par l'OMS -- Good Practices in Manufacturing and Quality Control of Drugs, in Official Records
of the WHO, No. 226, Annex 12, 1975. Un distributeur quelconque ne sera autoris6 I soumissionner
a un appel d'offres de medicaments que s'il est explicitement autorise par un producteur pre-selectionn6
I le faire; I'autre possibilite est pour un distributeur qui a d6jk obtenu l'autorisation de mise sur le march6
au SenEgal pour un produit ayant les specifications requises.
3.           La tache de proceder I cette pre-selection est delicate, puisqu'il y a au moins 300
producteurs primaires qui peuvent demander cette pr6-s6lection; il faudra donc obtenir la documentation
necessaire d'une troisibme partie inddpendante habilit6e; en accord avec l'OMS et dependant du pays
concerne, il pourra s'agir, soit l'agence de contr6le du pays du producteur, soitune agence internationale.
Cette selection implique, au moins, les criteres suivants de selection: un nombre minimum d'annees (cinq
ans en general) a fabriquer un m6dicament spEcifie dans une forme et un dosage fixes, un certificat de
bonne pratique de moins de deux ans certifie par l'OMS, des copies certifi6es de commandes recentes
de medicaments essentiels a des pays non industrialises et aux conditions climatiques similaires b celle
du S6negal, et des documents financiers certifies ou "auditEs". Periodiquement, tous les 2 ans sans doute,
on procddera a la rEvision de cette liste de pr6-selection, soit en excluant ceux pour lesquels des
performances non satisfaisantes sont signal6es, soit pour accepter des producteurs qui soumettraient les
documents pour satisfaire aux criteres mentionnes. Les procedures de publicite seront finalisees en accord
avec l'OMS et l'IDA.
4.           Specifications du produit et de son conditionnement. Tout medicament essentiel ne pourra
faire l'objet d'un appel d'offres que s'il est sur la liste officielle promulguee par le Ministre de la sant6
publique. La specification de chaque medicament essentiel fera l'objet de soins particuliers pour eviter
toute ambiguTte. D'abord, on utilisera exclusivement la liste officielle des noms de medicaments selon
la procddure appelee DCI en fran0ais "denomination commune internationale" ou en anglais,
'international non-proprietary name". Pour chaque produit, on indiquera le contenu et la forme du

Appendice, Page 8
dosage, y compris les durees de validite basees sur une norme pharmacopeenne appropriee I chaque cas
(norme etrangere en vigueur). En ce qui concerne les normes de conditionnement et de labelisation, on
se conformera a celles editees dans le document de 1'OMS sur les bonnes pratiques industrielles, en y
incluant certaines specifications pour tenir compte des particularites climatiques du Senegal.
5.            Probilmes de contrat. Leur contenu devra etre conforme I celui en usage pour les autres
produits faisant l'objet d'un commerce international. Comme il s'agit de medicaments, avec chaque envoi
ou "consigmment" le soumissionnaire fournira le certificat de qualite donnant les rdsultats des differents
tests obligatoires -- verification de composition, analyse chimique, sterilite, test microbien. Certains
medicaments devront etre expedies dans des conditions prdcises de temperature et stockage, et une clause
specifiera les conditions sous lesquelles un produit qui ne respecte les normes prescrites pourra Wtre
refuse.
6.            Procedures de passation des marchds. L'adjudication des appels d'offres de medicaments
pourra se faire sur base de passation pluriannuelle des marches pour chaque medicament avec
Echelonnement des livraisons; cette procedure apparait I la fois plus facile pour selectionner les offres
que celle par lot de medicaments et plus efficace pour obtenir les meilleurs prix. Seuls les fournisseurs
pre-selectionnes pourront participer. Les prix soumis seront definitifs pour la premiere livraison et
estimatifs pour les autres livraisons avec confirmation trois mois avant la date fixee pour ces livraisons.
L'organisme habilite se reservera le droit d'ajuster le volume de la livraison suivante aux besoins exacts
des acheteurs. Un echelonnement de ces livraisons devrait permettre de limiter le stockage et preserver
la qualite des produits.
7.            Mesures pour assurer la gualit . Tout soumissionnaire devra joindre tous les documents
de contrdle de qualite avec chaque envoi. La procedure recommandee est de requerir une inspection de
contrdle avant expedition. Localement, chaque envoi pourra faire l'objet de verifications ponctuelles par
sondage. Cela exigera le renforcement de la structure nationale de contrOle, et l'identification des
substances qui sont le plus sensibles therapeutiquement ou I l'environnement. Le renforcement de ces
mesures implique que la mdthV&l de remplacement de medicaments defectueux soit explicitEe dans les
termes des contrats d'achat, aiusi que le critere d'elimination de tout fournisseur defectueux de la liste
de pre-selection.
8.            Exceptions. En cas d'urgence - epidemie, desastre naturel - les medicaments pourront
etre achetes en utilisant une procddure exceptionnelle. Aprbs declaration d'urgence par le Ministre de
la sante publique, la passation en direct d'un marche est autorisee I condition de ne pas exceder la limite
de 60.000 dollars EU equivalent. Les quotations devront provenir d'au moins trois fournisseurs pr6-
selectionnes; les delais de livraison pourront etre utilises comme criteres de selection du soumissionnaire.
Les agences de sante appartenant I l'ONU seront invitees I soumissionner.
9.            PrEparation des documents. Une condition de deboursement des fonds destines aux
medicaments sera la finalisation des procedures a utiliser et de la premibre liste de producteurs pre-
selectionnes. Pour ce faire, le Ministbre de la Sante se fera assister d'un expert international, s6lectionnE
en accord avec l'IDA et l'OMS, pour aider la Commission des marches, la PNA et autres organismes
habilites a se mettre d'accord sur le contenu detaille des dossiers d'appels d'offres, les critbres de pre-
selection des soumissionnaires, les critbres de selection et autres procedures de passation des marches.

REPUBLIOUE DU SENEGAL
PROJET DE DEVELOPPEMENT DES RESSOURCES HUMAINES
Population et Sante
Le systeme d'organisations communautaires
participant I l'effort de sante
Revision des structures atuelles
Le systbme actuel d'organisations communautaires de sante (OCS)
1.           La participation des populations I l'effort de sante se fait a tous les niveaux du systeme
de sante par l'intermediaire des comites de sante et les associations pour la sante (APS) et pour les
hopitaux (APH). Seules les associations sont codifiees par un Arrete ministeriel du 25 fevrier 1983. Les
comites et associations, qui constituent le reseau d'OCS participant a l'effort de sante, sont autonomes
par rapport aux structures sanitaires publiques et ont pour objectif principal de participer I la gestion et
au fmancement de leurs activites.
2.           Au niveau des formations sanitaires peut se former un comite de san, compose de
representants des populations desservies par une meme structure sanitaire. Le comite de sante est
represente par deux bureaux, un de gestion, comprenant sept membres, et un de co-gestion. Le bureau
de gestion est charge d'executer les plans d'action, tandis que le bureau de co-gestion est charge de
l'execution des actions et du budget de fonctionnement. 11 existe dgalement trois commissions, chacune
ayant des fonctions administratives et financibres, sanitaires et promotionnelles. Les fonds du budget du
comite proviennent de deux sources differentes: les recettes tirees des tarifs preleves sur chaque visite
et les revenus obtenus des cotisations, activites remuneratrices ou des appuis financiers externes. Le
President et le tresorier du comite sont co-signataires de toutes les operations bancaires du comite. Le
Medecin-Chef de la circonscription ou l'Infirmier-Chef de Poste detient ie chequier, et coordonne et
adapte les plans d'action du comite I la politique definie par le Ministere de la sante.
3.           Au niveau de la circonscription medicale (correspondant au niveau administratif du
ddpartement), l'organe de participation est I'APS, representee par une assemblde generale elue par les
comites de sante. L'APS est seule reconnue par le Ministbre de 'Intdrieur comme l'organe officiel
charge de la tutelle des comites de sante. En tant que telle, elle peut creer ou dissoudre un comit6 et
possWde un pouvoir de decision sur celui-ci dans les domaines de l'information, formation, education,
evaluation et supervision. A l'instar du comite, I'APS comprend un bureau de gestion (elu par son
assemblee generale tous les deux ans), un de co-gestion et trois commissions, avec des attributions
identiques. Le budget de fonctionnement de l'APS est alimente par un versement mensuel de 7% des
recettes de chaque comite qui peuvent egalement couvrir les depenses des comites si besoin est.
4.           Au niveau des hOpitaux se sont formees recemment des APH dont la composition, le
fonctionnement, et les attributions des responsables sont semblables I ceux des comites de sante, adaptds
aux besoins specifiques de l'hopital.

5.            Les OCS ont joue un rOle important dans la gestion financibre des recettes dans un
contexte de rarefaction des ressources budgetaires, ces recettes representant la principale source de
financement pour l'achat des medicaments dans les postes et centres de sante. Neanmoins, une enqufte
nationale, mende par le MSPAS pour la preparation du projet, a confirme un certain nombre de faiblesses
dans leur fonctionnement. Ces faiblesses, qui ont contribue I decrottre la participation des communautes
a l'effort de sante publique provoquant un plafonnement des fonds mobilises, concerneraient:
(a)    le fait que seule une APS a une existence legale et possede une tutelle sur les comites au
niveau des postes. Cette tutelle contfre I I'APS un tel pouvoir de decision sur les
communautes se sont senties exclues des activites et s'en sont donc progressivement
desinteressees.
(b)    I'impression que les APS et APH ont ete prises en main par des notables, les conditions
de re-elections et de verification de gestion etant imprecises dans I'arrete ministeriel. Les
associations ont alors ete percues comme servant des interets particuliers.
(c)    I'absence de contrOle externe des fonds collectes, et par consequent souvent thesaurises,
avec une faible priorite donnee aux besoins des centres, tels que les medicaments.
(d)    la faible participation du personnel de sante dans la definition des activites des OCS.
6.            Pour promouvoir la participation des communautes I I'amelioration de lours oonditions
sanitaires et la decentralisation de la gestion des structures de sante publique qui les concernent, et
renforcer les moyens de contrOle sur les activites des OCS, le Gouvernement a decide de modifier les
principes (statut, representativite, rOle et fonctions) qui ont guide la creation des OCS et le systeme lEgal
et r6glementaire existant. De nouveaux principes, exposEs ci-apres, ont et6 adoptes par le MSPAS, apres
consultation avec des personnalit6s nationales et les principaux donateurs concern6s, y compris l'IDA.
Ces principes ont maintenant 6t6 transcrits dans le systame l6gal et r6glementaire, discut6s avoc I'IDA,
et soumis aux autorites concernees pour approbation d6finitive et publication officielle (conditions de mise
en vigueur du projet), permettant ainsi la prise d'un certain nombre de mesures lEgales et rdglementaires
qui regiront le reseau des OCS (para. 14).
7.            La restructuration du systeme d'OCS touchera principalement le comite de sante pour lui
donner un statut l6gal, une autonomie financiere et de gestion, les regles de controle, clairement
specifiees, et la gestion financiere, 6tablie de telle sorte pour donner priorit6 aux besoins des
infrastructures sanitaires. Dans le programme, cette restructuration ne concerne pas les APH dont le
statut, semblable dans les textes officiels I celui des autres comitds de sante ne devrait neanmoins Otre
mis en oeuvre qu'une fois achev6e I'6tude sur le fonctionnement des hOpitaux regionaux et du CHU
pr6vue par le MSPAS.
Organisation d'un reseau d'associations restructur6
8.            Un comiti de san   se compose d'une assembl6e gEnErale et des organes d'ex6cution.
Les membres de l'assembl6e gen6rale sont: (a) pour un poste de sante rurale, tous les chefs de carre de
villages ou leurs reprdsentants, et les repr6sentants des groupements de femmes et des associations de
jeunes; (b) pour un poste de sante urbain, tous les d61egues de quartiers, et les representants des
groupements de femmes et des associations de jeunes; et (c) pour un centre de sante, les reprdsentants
des comit6s de poste (qui dEpendent du centre pour la r6f*rence) et du comit6 des riverains du centre.



- 148 -
ANNEXE 3-10
Page 3 sur 6
Les organes d'execution sont le bureau, le sous-comit6 charg6 de la co-gestion avec les responsables des
formations sanitaires, le sous-comit6 charg6 des actions sanitaires, et le sous-comit6 charg6 du contr6le.
9.            L'assemblee generale sera responsable d'approuver le programme d'action, les tarifs et
conditions de participation ou d'acces aux formations sanitaires, et de l'utilisation des fonds disponibles
aux fins de promouvoir, d'une part, les activites des formations de sante, et d'autre part, les actions
d'am61ioration de l'environnement -anitaire et de l'hygiene publique de la zone couverte correspondante.
Le budget distinguera dans sa presentation: les activites de la formation sanitaire financ6es principalement
a partir des recettes; et les actions sur la zone financees exclusivement par les autres revenus.
10.          La gestion de ce budget sera confide au bureau, 61u par I'assembl6e g6n6rale pour deux
ans et comprenant au moins 3 membres servant de pr6sident, tr6sorier, et secretaire. Le bureau sera en
outre responsable de: percevoir les tarifs sur les visites; honorer les d6penses pr6vues aux budgets annuels
approuves par l'assembl6e generale; passer, avec le responsable de la formation -Infirmier-Chef du Poste
ou Medecin Chef du District-, les commandes de produits pour la formation sanitaire, notamment de
m6dicaments et produits essentiels. Le bureau sera soumis I des regles strictes et pr6cises de gestion,
notamment en ce qui concerne les procedures comptables et l'allocation des fonds, et rendra compte de
ses activites I l'assembl6e deux fois par an. Grace a la nouvelle loi, I voter par l'Assemblee nationale
du S6negal, soumettant les comites au Code des obligations civiles et commerciales, les membres des
bureaux pourront repondre en justice d'actes contraires aux reglements en vigueur, offrant une garantie
de contr6le et sanction qui faisait defaut pour les comit6s actuels.
11.          Les bureaux de chaque comit6 de poste de sant6 de la zone de refErence relevant d'un
centre de sante ou eventuellement d'un hdpital r6gional) constitueront l'assemblde gendrale du comitd &
district (Association pour la sante) qui sera responsable, avec le MEdecin-Chef du District, du
fonctionnement du centre de reference et de l'ex6cution des programmes d'actions au niveau du district;
I ces representants pourront se joindre ceux du comite des riverains du centre pour lesquels il joue le r6le
de poste. 1/ Leur principale fonction est Evidemment d'assurer 1'ex6cution des programmes et du
budget decoulant des PDDS (a mise en oeuvre des PDDS est d6crite I l'Annexe 3-4, et la gestion
financi4re d'un district de sante est pr6sentee en dEtail I I'Annexe 3-8). Ce budget sera alimente soit par
les tarifs percus sur les consultations et interventions du centre de rEfErence, des tarifs eventuels sur les
visites r6fEr6es par les postes de sant6, ou soit par une contribution forfaitaire venant des comitds de sante
relevant du district, soit par des contributions financieres externes. Ces revenus serviront I complEter
le financement des activitds du district, d6finies par le PDDS et le MCD, en particulier en ce qui
concerne le fonctionnement du centre de reference. Comme il en eat pour le poste. de sant6, la gestion
du budget reposera sur un bureau elu par l'assembl6e gEnerale. Les procedures de gestion, en particulier
les procEdures comptables, et les mesures de contrOle s'appliquant I l'association de district et I son
bureau seront semblables I ceux pour le comit6 de poste et son bureau.
Aspects financiers
12.          Sous le plan de financement proposE pour les districts sanitaires (voir Annexe 3-8), les
contributions des clients canalisees I travers les comites de sant6 sont essentielles au fonctionnement du
I/ n faut noter que, dans le cadre de la reforme du secteur de la sant6 proposee, le district
sanitaire remplace la circonscription m6dicale comme unit6 op6rationnelle du systeme de
prestation des services (Annexe 3-4).

poste de sante, et a un moindre niveau, pour le centre de reference. Pour le poste, le comite doit
mobiliser les revenus suffisants pour couvrir 100% du coOt des medicaments et des salaires du personnel
de soutien ainsi qu'une partie des coats recurrents; des allocations budgetaires gouvernementales
couvriront uniquement le salaire de l'infirmier et d'autres coats recurrents. L'obligation totale de la
communaute serait 1 a 3 millions FCFA par an, ceci dependant du taux d'utilisation, et correspondrait
a une contribution moyenne par client de 400 FCFA par visite. En plus de la mobilisation des fonds
suffisants I l'operation des postes de sante, le comite devra assurer l'utilisation appropriee de ces fonds,
a savoir: (a) assurer l'utilisation des fonds dans les operations du poste (avec l'obligation de tenir des
comptes separes pour les fonds utilises pour d'autres "projets"), et (b) assurer leur allocation appropriEe
entre les composantes suivantes - medicaments, au mois 70% des revenues; salaires, environ 25%; et
d'autres depenses rdcurrentes, environ 5%. ZI Cos elements de gestion financibre feront partie des
reglements que le Gouvernement doit edicter pour la gestion des comites de sante et definissant les
obligations specifiques de chaque partie concernee.
13.           Bien qu'une contribution relativement plus faible soit attendue des clients au niveau du
district et surtout du centre de sante (voir Annexe 3-9 pour details), il est prevu un systeme de fixation,
collecte et gestion des revenus au niveau du district semblable a celui qui existe au niveau des postes et
qui impliquera une co-gestion avec le MCD. Les textes officiels prevoient que les comitds sont
entierement responsables de l'utilisation dans le district des rewnus qui collectent. Cette approche est
un complement crucial aux mesures de decentralisation budgetaire au niveau du district mises en oeuvre
en parallele par le Gouvernement. Comme tout comite, I'association du district (en association avec les
collectivites locales eventuellement) pourra choisir de mobiliser des ressources supplementaires en vue
de subventionner les contributions de tous les clients ou seulement une certaine categorie moins favorisee.
Ces ressources supplementaires pourraient egalement servir I ameliorer la qualite des services fournis,
en plus de financer des programmes pour ameliorer les conditions sanitaires au niveau du district.
Aspects lEgaux et L4Iementairos
14.           Pour permettre la mise en place du reseau d'associations ainsi restructurE, il est necessaire
que les mesures legales et reglementaires suivantes soient adoptees:
(a)    la modification du Code des obligations civles et commerciales pour y inclure les
associations participant I l'effort de sante publique, et ce apres approbation de
l'Assemblee Nationale.
(b)   la publication du decret, signe par le President de la Republique, fixant les obligations
particulieres auxquelles seront soumises les associations.
(c)    la publication du statut-type et de reglement pour les comites de sante et leurs
associations. Ce decret sera co-signe par les Ministres de la Sante publique et de
l'Intdrieur.
2/ On notera que dans les statuts officiels adoptes par le gouvernement, il est stipule que
60% au moins des revenus du comite doivent ere affectes I des medicaments. Les calculs de
l'Annexe 3-8 montre qu'en moyenne un comite de poste devrait avoir I depenser 70% de ses
revenus en medicaments, I moins qu'il ne puisse ameliorer la consommation unitaire par
rapport aux normes adoptees dans cette Annexe.

(d)   la mise en oeuvre par les autorites administratives des procedures de transition pour les
comites des APS existants qui seront abolis et soumis au nouveau reglement. En ce qui
concerne leurs actifs, ils seront reverses aux nouveaux comites de sante.
15.          Des projets de textes ont etd discutes avec le MSPAS au moment de 1'evaluation et
finalises I la negociation. Leur approbation definitive et leur publication est une condition de mise en
vigueur du credit IDA.
Mise en place des comites de sant= et leurs associations
16.          Lorsque ce cadre legal et reglementaire aura ete offlciellement adopte, on pourra alors
proceder a la mise en place des associations. Le Medecin-Chef du district sera responsable de
programmer cette mise en place, en collaboration avec les autorites du district (prefets et sous-prefets).
Une fois le Plan de developpement du district sanitaire adopte, un Echeancier sera finalise pour les postes
de sante, en raison de 3 a 5 postes par an sur 5 ans.  DMs l'approbation de cet echeancier par les
autorites regionales (Medecin-Chef Regional et gouverneur), un programme de mise en oeuvre sera etabli
par le Medecin-Chef du district, eventuellement en consultation avec le bailleur de fonds participant I la
promotion des activitds du district. Ce programme de mise en oeuvre comprendra les tournees de
sensibilisation, la reunion des representants k l'assemblde generale de chaque comite en commensant par
les postes, et des journees d'information avec les bureaux et membres des sous-comites de santE elus par
ces assemblees.
17.          Chaque programme de mise en oeuvre, incluant l'echeancier de mise en place des
associations de sante, sera soumis au Medecin-Chef de Region pour non-objection. Une copie sera
transmise au MSPAS pour information. La mise en place des associations sera dgalement suivie par,
d'une part, le service en charge des soins de sante primaire I la Direction de la sante publique qui
preparera un rapport semestriel k cet egard, et d'autre part, au moins dans la phase initiale, un membre
du cabinet du Ministre de la sante designe par le Ministre.
AMpUi prevu dans le cadre du programme pour Dromouvoir les OCS
18.          Parallelement aux mesures institutionnelles, des moyens d'appui pour promouvoir les
associations devront 8tre disponibles. Le programme financera ces moyens qui incluent:
(a)    des campagnes de sensibilisation pour informer le grand public des droits et obligations
des comites de sante et leur role dans la promotion de la sante de base. Ces informations
seront communiquees par les moyens d'information-Education-communication classiques
(emissions de television et de radio; journaux, affiches).  Les campagnes de
sensibilisation seront particulierement cruciales lors des elections des comites. Le
programme financera specifiquement la conception de ces campagnes, dont la duree est
prevue pour 9 semaines, ainsi que deux emissions de television et six de radio chaque
annee pendant cinq ans, et la diffusion de 200.000 affiches.
(b)    un opuscule a l'intention du grand public contenant les objectifs recherches en instituant
les comites et les bEnefices pour les communautes. Cat opuscule sera prepare par un
specialiste en litterature de vulgarisation populaire (2 semaines) et traduit en six langues
nationales, financEs dans le cadre du programme. Cet opuscule pourra 8tre utilise dans

les cours d'alphabetisation fonctionnelle, comme ceux prevus pour les groupements de
femmes (Annexe 3-2).
(c)    un manuel I l'usage des membres des comites et leurs associations contenant le
fonctionnement, les procedures, leurs droits et responsabilites, ainsi que les proc6dures
et documents comptables et de gestion standardises pour faciliter leur travail et les
moyens de controle. La preparation de ce manuel requibrera 24 semaines de deux
specialistes, prevus en deux temps, finances sur fonds PPF.
(d)    une etude sur l'efficacite du systeme de recouvrement des coi1ts, y compris les reactions
de tous les groupes beneficiaires des comites de santE, notamment leur degre de
connaissance sur ces comites et de leur participation. Cette etude sera programmee I la
mi-parcours de l'execution du programme.
La formation des comites sera dispensee par l'Infirmier-Chef de Poste et/ou par le medecin Chef de
district en cooperation avec les autorites prefectorales et sous-prefectorales, qui, pour ce faire, recevront
une formation sur l'organisation de comites de sante. Cette formation est prevue dans la composante
Services de Sante du District. Plus particulibrement, l'Inftrmier-Chef de Poste formera les billeteurs aux
rudiments du systeme comptable ainsi que les responsables des comites I la nature des responsabilites,
obligations et procddures des organes d'execution et des responsables du systeme de sante public.

Population and Health
Supervision Plan
1.           Bank supervision input. Regular supervision needs are described in the table below. In
addition, specific tasks such as review of progress reports, procurement and disbursement actions, audit
reviews, etc., are estimated to require a total of four-staff weeks of various specialists inputs per annum.
2.           Borrower's Contribution to Supervision
(a)    Progress reports will be submitted twice a year, in April and October; they will comprise a
summary of implementation under each project component, as well as financial tables. The
Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) will collect inputs from each Component Support Unit (CSU)
and prepare the reports;
(b)    Project coordination, monitoring and evaluation will be the responsibility of the PCU, under the
overall guidance of the Interministerial Committee;
(c)    Once a year, in October, a joint Government/donors review covering all aspects of the project
would be held on the basis of a report prepared one month earlier by PCU. The joint annual
reviews would be chaired by the Director of Planning in the Ministry of Economy, Finance and
Plan (MEFP). A comprehensive review of the progress of project implementation will be held
in June 1994;
(d)    The PCU will be responsible for coordinating arrangements for IDA supervision missions and
for p. 'viding information to them. Officials from the concerned agencies will accompany the
missions on field trips; and
(e)    Mission briefing meetings on arrival and wrap-up meetings will be chaired by the Director of
Planning in the MEFP with the participation of the heads of PCU and CSUs and representatives
of the implementing agencies.
3.           Cofinanciers' Contribution to Supervision. Cofinanciers will be consulted on, and invited
to participate in supervision activities, and will be kept fully informed regarding TORs, aide-memoires
and results of IDA supervision missions. It is expected that cofinanciers will participate in the April Joint
Annual Review and bring complementary skills to the supervision missions.
