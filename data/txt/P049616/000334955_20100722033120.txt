About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank's work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
the Bank's lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for
which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government,
and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
in local offices as appropriate.
     Each PPAR is subject to internallEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to
the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to
the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEGWB Rating System
     IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to
arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additional information is available on the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, effiCiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's
objectives are consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This report contains a comparative assessment of the performance of three projects
dealing with land administration and redistribution in EI Salvador and Guatemala. The
main report compares findings from the three projects. This is one of a number of
thematically-clustered, cross-country project evaluations that the Independent Evaluation
Group has conducted in recent years.

The Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for each project is presented in
Annexes 1-3. Annex 1 contains the PPAR for the EI Salvador Land Administration
Project, for which a loan ofUS$50 million was approved on March 5, 1996 and closed on
June 30, 2005. Annex 2 contains the PPAR for the Guatemala Land Administration
Project, for which a loan ofUS$31 million was approved on December 3, 1998 and
closed on March 31,2007. Annex 3 contains the PPAR for the Guatemala Land Fund
Project, for which a loan ofUS$23 million was approved on January 7, 1999 and closed
on June 30, 2005.

The report was prepared by the Independent Evaluation Group (lEG), which conducted a
mission to EI Salvador and Guatemala in November-December 2009. The report is based
on the project appraisal and completion reports, the Loan Agreements, project files,
references in the literature produced by academic and advocacy institutions, press reports,
and discussions with 'project participants, Bank staff, government officials and
representatives of non-governmental organizations. A list of those interviewed is
cont'lined in an appendix to each of the PP ARs. The cooperation and assistance of all
stakeholders and the support of the World Bank Country Offices in EI Salvador and
Guatemala is gratefully acknowledged.

Following standard IEG procedures, a draft of the main report and the respective PPAR
was sent to each Borrower for comment before being finalized. No comments were
received from the Borrowers. The final report will be available to the public following
submission to the World Bank's Board of Directors.

Summary
This report assesses the performance of three projects that tackled various aspects ofland
administration and land redistribution in EI Salvador and Guatemala and draws conclusions
based on a comparative analysis of the three projects.

The three projects in EI Salvador and Guatemala that are assessed in this report were each
cases of a long-term, programmatic commitment that the Bank entered into in the late 1990s,
building on the Peace Accords that were signed (in 1992 in EI Salvador; and in 1996 in
Guatemala). The two land administration projects involved a process of systematic
adjudication by area, a region-wide sweep whose aim was to generate more accurate
information, first, on the geographic characteristics of urban and rural properties (cadastre
data) and, second, on the extent of legal property rights (registry data). The Guatemala Land
Fund Project (P054462) was launched simultaneously with the Land Administration Project
and aimed to sponsor the redistribution of lands to poor families, using a willing-buyer,
willing-seller model, with government financing the purchase ofland (through loans) and the
Bank supporting complementary investments in infrastructure and services (through grants).

The assessment of the three projects yielded five main findings:

       There is a lack of evidence that the land administration projects increased tenure
        security and associated economic benefits;
       Progress in integrating registry and cadastre institutions was uneven;
       Land regularization is likely to have more impact on urban than rural areas;
       Redistributive land reform in Guatemala has been hampered by deficiencies of
        project design and wavering commitment; and
       Although the objectives of the land administration projects explicitly referred to the
        aim of paying special attention to the needs of the poor, project design and
        implementation did not take sufficient steps to ensure adequate coverage of this
        group.

The outcome of the El Salvador Land Administration Project is rated satisfactory. There
are signs that the project boosted the dynamism of land markets with potentially efficiency-
enhancing consequences. More importantly, registry and cadastre procedures were greatly
improved and Centro Nacional de Registros (National Registry Center -- CNR) achieved
core financial self-sufficiency, serving as a model for other countries. The unit costs for
regularization were in the range observed elsewhere. Although there are some doubts about
whether land tenure was generally as insecure as assumed at appraisal, the focus on
increasing efficiency by creating a unified cadastre and registry was appropriate and the
improvement of land use capacity is particularly important for the fast-growing urban areas
ofEI Salvador. The project substantially achieved its objectives. Although only two-thirds of
the projected number of parcels was covered, this was what was feasible with the available
funds (the cost per hectare of regularization was underestimated at appraisal).

The outcome of the Guatemala Land Administration Project is rated unsatisfactory.
While the objectives of the project were substantially relevant, the design of the project
contained several flaws, including the questionable appropriateness of Peten as locus of the
operation. Although the project successfully developed a parcel-based geographical cadastral
database, contrary to appraisal expectations, there is no technological platform for integration
                                               x


with the deed-based registry database. Also, targets for cadastral surveying and titling were
not met. Data inconsistencies raise questions about the 27 percent economic rate of return
that the completion report claims.

The outcome of the Guatemala Land Fund Project is rated moderately unsatisfactory.
Project objectives were highly relevant, seeking as they did to serve the ends of equity and
efficiency by redistributing underused land. But there were several flaws in project design,
including notably the failure to set a limit per family on the size of the land purchase loan,
reducing the incentive for beneficiaries to bargain hard over the price. The project achieved
its objectives to a modest extent. Although double the expected number of beneficiary
families was served, there is no solid evidence to demonstrate that land productivity
increased significantly or that the land market operated more efficiently as a consequence of
the land fund. Owing partly to shortfalls in the provision for working capital and the lack of
adequate technical assistance for land fund beneficiaries, the economic rate of return is
probably lower than expected.

Comparative analysis of the three projects yields the following lessons:

       Assumptions about the boost to tenure security that will result from land
        administration initiatives (and corollary assumptions about improved access to credit
        and reduced conflict) should be carefully examined and tested with empirical
        evidence.
       Integrating the databases of cadastre and registry is important to facilitate land use
        planning and tax assessments, but this integration can be attained by providing
        separate cadastre and registry agencies with a common technical platform-it does
        not presuppose creation of a single cadastre/registry agency (which may not be
        politically feasible).
       Land administration initiatives need to be prioritized by geographic area; other
        development programs may be more appropriate for remote rural areas.
       The design problems associated with Guatemala's attempt at market-assisted land
        reform need to be avoided in subsequent projects; there is much scope for learning
        from these design flaws and the relevance of land reform should not be lightly
        dismissed.
       During the design and preparation of land administration and land redistribution
        projects, mechanisms need to be developed for ensuring that the poor will have
        access to the land administration process and to opportunities for obtaining land. The
        effectiveness of these mechanisms needs to be continuously monitored.
       The net gains from land administration and land reform initiatives should not be
        regarded as self-evident; much more attention must be given to measuring the impact
        of these initiatives. This means that when projects are prepared-rather than later-
        provision must be made for conducting baseline and follow-up surveys with
        appropriate control groups.

1. Background
1.1     This report discusses the main findings to emerge from lEG's assessment of the
performance of three World Bank-supported projects on land administration and land
redistribution in El Salvador and Guatemala. It examines issues bearing on the legal
security of land tenure, the adequacy of registry and cadastre institutions, the scope for
redistributive land reform, and the attention to the needs of the poor.

Similarities and Differences: EI Salvador and Guatemala
1.2     The countries share a similar colonial legacy, have both experimented with land
redistribution based on expropriation and, in the 1980s, both underwent civil wars. Both
countries have a concentrated pattern oflandholding (originally associated with export-
oriented plantation agriculture), a long history of tenure insecurity, a number of
indigenous communities with communal property rights, rich biodiversity, and a fast-
growing urban population. There are also significant differences between them:
Guatemala is less densely populated; a larger proportion of its territory is located in
protected areas; a much bigger share of its population is accounted for by indigenous
communities; and more of its people are poor (Table 1).

1.3     The three projects in El Salvador and Guatemala that are assessed in this report
were each cases of a long-term, programmatic commitment that the Bank entered into in
the late 1990s, building on the Peace Accords that were signed (in 1992 in El Salvador;
and in 1996 in Guatemala).

1.4     The two land administration projects involved a process of systematic
adjudication by area, a region-wide sweep whose aim was to generate more accurate
information, first, on the geographic characteristics of urban and rural properties
(cadastre data) and, second, on the extent of legal property rights (registry data). The
                                                     2


programs were ultimately intended to be nationwide in scope, covering all private
property. Coverage of protected areas, indigenous and agrarian reform communities was
limited to boundary delimitation; no attempt was made to adjudicate land within these
boundaries. Both projects were justified by the Bank on the grounds that they would
contribute to more efficient resource distribution and help to reduce poverty, given that
the existing cadastral and registration systems were "overly bureaucratic, costly,
inaccessible, centralized, corrupt and not transparent to the users".l A shared theme was
decentralization of the cadastre and registry offices, which was intended to bring these
services closer to users, encouraging a swelling of the pool of fee-paying customers. A
challenge cornmon to both countries was to move land administration onto a business
footing, creating autonomous agencies that would raise revenues by selling services and
land information.

1.5      There were' two important differences between the two projects. The EI Salvador
project combined cadastre and registry functions in a single agency; and did not include a
land titling component. In contrast, the Guatemala project had separate agencies for
cadastre and registry; and another agency (Fontierras) was responsible for providing
private titles for parcels carved out of public lands (terrenos nacionales) on the rural
frontier and common land (ejidos) in towns. Thus, project design needed to provide for
mechanisms to ensure coordination between three agencies.

1.6     There was another difference in the approach taken by the Bank in each country.
In Guatemala, the Bank advanced both efficiency and equity arguments for supporting a
parallel initiative to redistribute land, launching a market-assisted land reform operation
to run in parallel with the land administration project. In EI Salvador, while still
significant, the inequities in the distribution of landholding were not as marked as in
Guatemala. Although both countries had witnessed earlier, abortive attempts at land
reform, this process had left more of a mark on the agrarian structure of EI Salvador
(Table 2)-and, concomitantly perhaps, had stirred up greater opposition to the notion of
further redistribution. Guatemala was a different story. There are no comparable data on
the area of land affected by reform in 1996 but the evidence indicates that the radical
redistribution programmed by the Arbenz administration in the early 1950s was reversed
by counter-reform. Moreover, unlike in EI Salvador, there is no land formally assigned to
agrarian reform communities. As some measure of the lack of impact of past land
redistribution efforts, the Gini coefficient increased from 0.82 in 1964 to 0.85 in 1979-
giving Guatemala the most unequal pattern of landholding for Central American
countries in the 1970s; the Gini for EI Salvador was 0.61 (in 1996)? This helps to explain
why the Bank and the government strongly supported market-assisted land reform in
Guatemala in the late 1990s. However, a decade later, this support had evaporated,
reflecting implementation difficulties and an erosion of government support.

The Projects
1.7     The EI Salvador Land Administration Project (P007174) sought to consolidate
and modernize land registry and the cadastre, drawing on the results of a pilot conducted
in the Department of Sonsonate that was financed under a Bank-supported project
approved in 1993. A single agency, the National Registry Center (CNR), combines
registration and cadastral functions. The project was designed to be nationwide in scope
but by the end of implementation had covered only two-thirds of the expected number of
parcels owing to higher than expected costs. The remaining area was to be covered by a
follow-on operation but this was cancelled for political reasons not specific to the project.
Bank support was ultimately substituted by a similar operation financed by the Central
American Bank for Economic Integration. A GEF Land Administration and Protected
Areas Project (P092202) is now being implemented, led by the Environment Ministry
(MARN), whose technical capacity and priorities are different from CNR.

1.8      The Guatemala Land Administration Project (P049616) was envisaged as the first
of a three-phase program to extend over twelve years. With respect to the part of the
program financed by the Bank, the first phase was limited to the Peten Department, a
frol1tier region that was selected because of its relatively favorable land policy and legal
framework. One of the aims of the project (not achieved) was to support integration of
the databases for registration and cadastre; unlike in EI Salvador, the functions remained
the responsibility of separate agencies, for political economy rather than technical
reasons. A second-phase, Bank-supported, project (P087106) is now underway.

1.9     The Guatemala Land Fund Project (P054462) was launched simultaneously with
the Land Administration Project and aimed to sponsor the redistribution of lands to poor
families, using a willing-buyer, willing-seller model, with government financing the
purchase ofland (through loans) and the Bank supporting complementary investments in
infrastructure and services (through grants). The project was nationwide in scope and the
number of families served was twice the level forecast at appraisal. There was a
significant shortfall in repayment of the land purchase loans; and complementary
investments were skimped.

Findings
1.10 The assessment of the three projects yielded five main findings, each of which is
explored at length in the following sections:
                                               4


       There is a lack of evidence that the land administration projects increased tenure
        security and associated economic benefits;
       Progress in integrating registry and cadastre was uneven;
       Land regularization is likely to have more impact on urban than rural areas;
       Redistributive land reform in Guatemala has been hampered by deficiencies of
        project design and wavering commitment; and
       Although the objectives ofthe land administration projects explicitly referred to
        the aim of paying special attention to the needs of the poor, project design and
        implementation did not take sufficient steps to ensure adequate coverage of this
        group.



2. Tenure Security and Associated Benefits
2.1      When the Bank prepared its land administration projects in EI Salvador and
Guatemala in the mid-1990s it made the largely unexamined assumption that cadastral
surveying, land registration and titling would necessarily enhance tenure security, thereby
facilitating access to credit, improving land management and reducing conflict.
Increasing tenure security was not just a question of providing legal title to land. An
earlier generation of US AID-funded projects focused narrowly on land titling. By failing
to strengthen the supporting infrastructure of registry and cadastre these projects failed to
ensure that subsequent transactions would be recorded. 3 Various donors, including the
Bank, argued that an alternative approach was needed, focused on building up cadastre
and registry institutions.

2.2     In the analytic work that helped to inform preparation of the Guatemalan project,
the Bank explained how the tenure security of the poor was hampered by the weaknesses
in the registry. "The land registry process ... makes it difficult for the poor to gain access
to land. This system is antiquated, inefficient, overly centralized, complicated, and until
recently was run by corrupt officials. Furthermore, registration requires buyers and sellers
to take costly actions, and in some cases they are required to be able to read and write.
Most land transactions in the Highlands are not legally registered because of the high
costs and inaccessibility of the land registry system. This leaves smallholders vulnerable
to usurpation and acts as a barrier to their access to credit. To transfer land, a buyer and
seller must reach an agreement and pay a notary or lawyer for a title-deed (Escritura
Publica). To guarantee security of ownership rights, Guatemala adheres to the principle
of publicity by having a title-deed registered in the Registro General de Propiedades, with
offices in Guatemala City and Quetzaltenango. If a land title holder does not properly
register the title in the Registry, his or her title cannot be guaranteed. To act in good faith,
a buyer is obliged to investigate the current legal status of the parcel in the Registry
before purchasing. All transactions are done by hand and involve significant legal and
travel costs for smallholders wishing to register their property. Moreover, there is no
mechanism in the system for the provision of a field sketch (croquis) of the property to
establish its characteristics and boundaries, leaving open the possibility of disputes and
rendering the system useless for natural resource management purposes. The

disfunctionality of the registry has become especially apparent in recent years with the
return of the refugees from Mexico, for whom available land must be identified and
purchased for their resettlement". 4

2.3      Clearly, even if it was not enough by itself (as the USAID projects had
demonstrated), the possession of title was a necessary part of the land regularization
package. The Bank was evidently persuaded that there was a more urgent need for a
titling component in Guatemala than in EI Salvador. In Guatemala, the Bank noted that
"only 41 percent of landowner households possess formal title to their land. Only a third
of the poor have land titles compared to almost half of the non-poor. .. Moreover, the
non-poor use land markets more than the poor. In particular, more than half of the land
owned by non-poor households was purchased on the market as compared with only a
third of the land owned by extreme poor households (the remainder being acquired by
inheritance)".s In contrast, in EI Salvador, land titles were widespread (Table 3).
(Although possibly the incidence of titling varied by gender: according to one source, in
urban areas, 78 percent of untitled properties belonged to women. 6) In EI Salvador, the
land administration program started in the most tenure secure areas (in the west of the
country, beginning in Sonsonate), areas where for the most part property was already
titled. According to the registry (CNR), the surveying of Sonsonate revealed that only
about 5 percent of land owners lacked title; but they recognized that for the country as a
whole there was no complete information about the level of titling and the lack of title
was probably more marked in the departments not covered by the project.

2.4     The assumption that regularization necessarily enhances tenure security bears
closer examination. In Guatemala, in particular, there is a rich literature from academics
and advocacy groups arguing that, to begin with, regularization merely seeks to
legitimize the long series of land grabs of which the country's history is made up (dating
back to the Spanish conquest); and that, moreover, even if the tenure status of peasant
farmers is regularized this will not protect them from subsequent acts of coercion,
intended to make them give up their land. 7 In the frontier department of Peten there is a
long history of conflict over land, most recently associated with the traffic in narcotics.
(Peten is a favorite spot for the landing strips used by small aircraft that ship cocaine, by
stages, from Colombia to the United States because it is so lightly populated and policed.)
Faced with this extra-economic coercion and in the absence of a broader framework of
law and order it is a moot point whether farmers hold legal title or whether the
characteristics of their parcels are accurately recorded. There is a whole literature-little

reflected in the Bank's discourse of the mid-1990s when these projects were designed-
that challenges the "a priori assertions of the benefits ofland administration projects:
improved land security, access to credit, increased land market activity, efficient land use
and poverty reduction".8 More recent Bank analytic work is less prone to make these a
priori assertions. 9

2.5      The Bank-supported program of land administration began in Peten. The appraisal
document said that land conflict was less of a problem there than in other parts of the
country. 10 A different picture emerged in a later Bank report. "The Northern lowlands are
comprised mainly of the Department of Peten, a frontier agricultural area with abundant
natural resources and limited infrastructure. In the 1950s migration into this area was
encouraged by the central government. This migration was not a part of a planned
process and land grabbing soon followed. Land grabbing persists today and has resulted
in uncertain land tenure and security. Municipalities, cooperative and associations of
farmers were allocated land for cultivation and exploitation, but often municipality limits,
land plot boundaries and rules of land use are ignored. This has created overexploitation
of land, which is largely not suited for (traditional) agriculture. Deforestation and overuse
oflands threaten protected areas". 11 Indeed, given that the first phase of the Bank-
supported land administration program aimed to steer clear of protected areas, Peten was
not an obvious starting point: covering 24 percent of the national territory this department
contained 76 percent of the land in Guatemala's protected areas. Peten was chosen as the
launch pad for the pragmatic reason that (unlike the rest of the country) it already had a
land law; therefore, project implementation could proceed immediately. But, as it turned
out, it took five years for additional critical legislation (the Cadastral Information Law) to
be introduced: between 2000 and 2005 regularization in Peten proceeded in a legal limbo.
Even if progress in Peten had been swift there is still a question about the applicability of
the experience acquired in this frontier department to other (longer-settled) parts of the
country-given that the ultimate intention was to cover the whole of Guatemala.

2.6      If there is doubt that, from a tenure security viewpoint, the best regions were
chosen as launch pads, what is the evidence that tenure security was actually enhanced by
these projects? Interviewee statements about their perceived level of security are one
measure. 12 But a proper ex-ante analysis of tenure security in a given area (which was not
undertaken in any of the reviewed land administration projects) would have examined
indicators that are not as subjective as respondents' security perceptions: for example, the
incidence of land disputes and their nature; the frequency and likelihood of land
transactions involving outsiders in rural communities; and differences between prices of
titled or registered lands and untitled/unregistered lands of the same quality. Such an
analysis would have allowed a determination of whether and where the types of
interventions considered would address issues of tenure insecurity.

2.7   The following paragraphs focus on the evidence that increased tenure security
enhanced access to credit and reduced land conflicts. In EI Salvador, data from the

12. However, perceptions were not systematically surveyed in either country.
                                             7


2007 agricultural census show that, of farmers receiving credit, on average, 36 percent of
those in the departments covered by systematic adjudication received credit from private
banks, compared to 27 percent for the departments that had not yet been adjudicated.
Only one of the six adjudicated departments (San Salvador) showed a lower rate of use of
private bank credit (22 percent) compared to the mean for non-adjudicated departments.
These findings may suggest the existence of a relationship between adjudication and
credit access but without a before/after comparison they are totally inconclusive. There is
some evidence that the western departments where the systematic regularization by area
started are better off than departments to the east so, irrespective of adjudication, they
may haye enjoyed better access to bank loans. A Guatemala study was subject to similar
limitations. Perez surveyed 48 families in Alta Verapaz who received land titles from
Fontierras between 2002 and 2003. He found that t the lack oftitle had not impeded their
access to credit previously and that, after title was received, there was a reduction in
access because credit terms became less favorable. 13 But the study lacks a control group
of the untitled.

2.8      A more rigorous study (referring to Guatemala) focused not on the enhancement
of credit access but whether there was an investment and productivity payoff to titling.
Based on a survey of ten coffee farms in 1992-1993 (i.e. well before start up of the
projects assessed here), Schweigert reported the following. "The data come from what
approaches a controlled experiment in which a set of formerly landless, rural households
were provided with access to land on which to cultivate a permanent crop. All were
provided credit, but only a subset of households had title. On parcels held by those
households with title, output and yield were, on the average, higher. The data are
consistent with a model of household behavior in which title, by increasing tenure
security, increases the investment of family labor in the present to generate higher future
output. The amount of additional output associated with title in this case is not only
statistically but economically significant". 14

2.9     With respect to the incidence of conflict over land rights, there is no decisive
evidence from either country to show what effect adjudication had. In EI Salvador, the
Procuradoria General de la Republica mediates in some boundary disputes (providing an
alternative to the courts) and its records show a sharp acceleration in the number of cases
attended since 1999, mainly reflecting the opening of new offices in the various
departments. But it is unclear what proportion these cases represent of the total number of
conflicts. The Land Administration Project included a small component to develop
alternative dispute resolution mechanisms (which would be particularly relevant to poor
people unable to afford legal representation) but the project implementing agency (CNR)
indicated that this activity did not proceed. However, absence of evidence is not evidence
of absence: the lack of data does not mean that the security objective was not achieved.

2.10 In Guatemala, the number of reported conflicts has risen sharply since the time
when the project was prepared (Figure 1). Once again, it could be that the number of
actual cases of conflict was constant (or even declined) over this period: there is no
indication of the relationship between actual and reported cases. The government agency
in charge of mediating land conflicts collects data on cases reported and "files closed";
closing the file does not necessarily mean that the conflict was resolved. Also, negotiated
agreements between parties in dispute are not legally binding. IS More relevant are the
data specific to Peten, the focus of the first land administration project. In 2008 and 2009
Peten was the department with the largest number of new conflicts reported. Peten has 3
percent of the population of Guatemala and 10 percent of the people reporting land
conflicts. This does not necessarily mean that the project was ineffective in tackling
conflict in Peten: if the conflict resolution agency (CONTIERRA) shines a spotlight on
disputes that were previously unacknowledged it will serve a useful purpose. 16 However,
the published numbers on reported conflicts probably still understate the total number of
conflicts. "Key land experts emphasized that up to tens of thousands of additional
disputes ... remain latent or unregistered". 17

2.11 It has been argued that full transferability of property rights is one measure of
tenure security. If this is the case, an upturn in property sales following adjudication
might suggest that adjudication has enhanced security. In Guatemala, lEG sought but
could not obtain data on land sales and mortgages (respectively, from the property
registry (GRP) and from Bamural). In EI Salvador, the implementing agency (CNR)
provided lEG with data in abundance but a simple comparison of the number of sales in
adjudicated and non-adjudicated departments was inconclusive (see EI Salvador PPAR
for details).

2.12 The scope for increasing tenure security was ultimately constrained by the
geographic area covered by these projects (plus, in Guatemala, the limited achievement
of titling targets). The EI Salvador project performed better than that in Guatemala but
even it had a substantial shortfall: two-thirds of the expected number of parcels were
registered (the intention at appraisal was to cover all 14 departments in the nation but
only 6 were completed). In Guatemala, the pace of cadastral surveying and titling
exceeded targets in the urban areas of Peten but only 3 percent of rural areas were both
cadastered and titled. Much more rural land was cadastered than titled (reflecting
differences in the efficiency of the agencies responsible for each task); but it is doubtful
that cadastering in the absence oftitling greatly enhances tenure security.

2.13 These various considerations call into question the assumption that these projects
enhanced tenure security. The increase in land registry revenues suggests that there is an
effective demand for the services they provide; implying in tum that those who are
willing and able to pay for the services are convinced that there is a payoff, which
probably includes tenure security and associated economic benefits. (It is less clear that
the poor have a strong demand for these services.) However, the weakness of the
monitoring data makes it impossible to draw conclusions about the socioeconomic profile
of the paying clients. Also, there is a lack of evidence that the three projects substantially
increased the incomes and productivity of project beneficiaries.



3. Integration of Registry and Cadastre
3.1      In EI Salvador, registry and cadastre are handled by the same agency (CNR); in
Guatemala, they are handled separately by the property registry (RGP) and the cadastral
institute (RIC). What can we learn from these two models?

3.2     In its guidance on best practice for investment projects the Bank observes that
where possible it is best to bring cadastre and registration under the auspices of a single
agency, rather than locate them in separate departments. 18 A single agency may permit
savings in the administrative overhead, savings that could potentially be passed on to
customers in lower fees. The cadastre function will always generate lower revenues than
the registry function, based on the relative volume of services demanded; also, in addition
to the revenue from property transactions, registries typically get additional incomes from
registering businesses and intellectual property rights. Integrating cadastre and registry
makes it possible for the former to be directly subsidized by the latter, thus reducing the
need to depend on transfers from the government budget. But the biggest reason for
supporting integration is to establish a seamless interface between the separate databases
for cadastre and registry, thus speeding up and making more accurate the verification of
information about land use and land rights. The payoff in terms of land use planning and
tax assessment is likely to be substantial.




18. World Bank (2006c), Module 10, p. 19.

3.3     There are two counter-arguments. First, integration of cadastre and registry
databases may be achieved by means of a technical fix: a common data platform for two
separate agencies. But the difficulty of securing this fix should not be underestimated.
Integration needs to be highlighted as a project risk in the appraisal report. The steps
toward integration need spelling out and progress needs monitoring. Project design
should include provision for mandatory periodic reports on the data integration progress.
Making coordination and integration the subject of loan conditionality may be advisable
to ensure that it actually takes place. The issue needs to be highlighted in supervision
reports and at the mid-term review.

3.4      Second, in countries where the registry is powerful and well established there is
likely to be stiff resistance to any proposal that, in the spirit of rationalization, it be
merged with the cadastral agency: too much turf and too many rents are at stake. In
Guatemala, the General Property Registry (RGP), founded in 1877, is one of the most
autonomous entities in the country. The Registrar is appointed by the President of the
Republic, and because the institution does not receive regular budget transfers (operating
with its own revenues), it is not subject to the standard fiduciary controls of other public
entities. 19 It would not have been realistic for the Bank to insist on formal integration.
Instead, the focus was placed on creating a common data platform between the registry
and the (new) cadastral institution.

3.5     The process of integration in Guatemala has lagged. Enabling legislation was
passed five years after the Bank loan became effective for the Land Administration
Project; and regulation of the 2005 law was still incomplete when that loan closed. The
project successfully developed a parcel-based geographical cadastral database but,
contrary to appraisal expectations, it had not been integrated with the deed-based registry
database at loan closing. 2o Integration had still not been achieved when lEG conducted its
mission in November 2009. Also, although cadastral data is available on-line, in the
offices of the cadastre, there are no computer terminals available for use by the public.
Under the follow-on project little progress toward integration has been made although
steps have been taken to strengthen working relations between the cadastre agency (RIC)
and the registry (RGP). A cadastre-registry committee has been set up and the technical
linkages have been established to enable the initial steps of the cadastral process to be
undertaken.

3.6      Although integration has progressed further in El Salvador than in Guatemala
there is some concern about the completeness of the regularization process. The project
sought to unify all the topographical and legal information of the parcels covered by the
area-based regularization process, creating a new, digitalized base that would seamlessly
connect registry and cadastre. In three of the six departments covered by the project (La
Libertad, La Paz, San Salvador), this process remained incomplete when implementation
ended; it was partially complete in the other three departments (Sonsonate, Ahuachapan
and Santa Ana).21 Several examples of this incomplete integration include the following.
First, a notary observed that the problem sometimes arose when the owner was absent


19. World Bank (2007), p. 35.

from the property when the surveyors arrived. Even if the landlord was present, the
survey team could still be denied entry. Second, a consultant referred to a specific case in
LaPaz (one of the "completed" departments) where, after adjudication, it was necessary
to pay US$2,000 for a re-survey to rectify measurement of a property of 100 manzanas-
calling into question the value of the initial adjudication process.

3.7     Nevertheless, the extent ofEI Salvador's achievement is considerable. Since the
project closed CNR has made further progress in bringing its offices up to
internationally-certified standards (the ISO 9001 process). Between 2006 and 2009 the
offices in San Salvador, Santa Ana, Sonsonate and Ahuachapan were all certified to be in
line with the international norms both for property registry and for update of the cadastre.

3.8     What is the evidence that EI Salvador, with its more integrated service, has
performed better than Guatemala where cadastre and registry are handled separately?
One performance measure is the time taken to register property. During implementation
of the assessed projects (1997-2007), there was a fall, in both countries, in the number of
working days needed to register a standard property transaction. The trend is confirmed
by an independent, worldwide survey, sponsored by the Bank's Doing Business initiative.
Data from this source suggest that Guatemala has recently outperformed EI Salvador
(Figure 2). Does this weaken the case for integration? A closer look at the data suggests
not. Whereas sale of a property in EI Salvador involves an obligatory pass by the
cadastre, in Guatemala it is only the registry that is involved: the data generated are less
complete in Guatemala, potentially hampering land use planning and tax assessments.

3.9     Moreover, the Doing Business data appear to understate progress made in EI
Salvador. lEG found that in September/October 2008 the average time needed to register
a real estate transaction was 7 days in the 6 departments that had been systematically
adjudicated compared to 19 days in departments not yet covered. 22 Even within the area
covered by systematic adjudication there was substantial variation, ranging from 3 days

in western department of Ahuachapan to 10 days in the capital, San Salvador. These
figures compare favorably with the Bank's Doing Business indicator: in 2008, according
to that source, it took 31 days to register property.

3.10 What of financial self-sufficiency?--one of the arguments for integration. Since
2005, the cash flow of the EI Salvador agency (CNR) cash has deteriorated, because fees
have not increased since 2001 while operating costs rose (Figure 3). However, it could be
argued that project costs (which, in addition to World Bank funding, include a follow-on
operation financed by the Central American Bank for Economic Integration) should be
allocated to the government's budget rather than CNR since it is quintessentially a public
good that is being provided. In this respect it is important to note the difference between
the costs resulting from a one-off process of systematic adjudication-where costs might
reasonably be borne by the government and funded through an externally funded project
because the aim is to jump start institutional development-and the subsequent costs
arising from the "regular business" of on-demand, sporadic adjudication (where costs are
borne by the person requesting the service). If project costs are subtracted, CNR is still
financially self-sufficient. The recent leveling-off of its operating costs increases the
likelihood that this outcome will be sustained.

3.11 There is a further consideration. The design of the EI Salvador model gives no
incentive for CNR to generate a surplus: any surplus that is generated has to be
transferred to the Treasury and cannot be used by CNR to help fund technical upgrading,
capacity building or any other efficiency-enhancing investments. The appraisal report
states that the legislature had approved CNR autonomy and self-financing by allowing
CNR to retain its revenues.23 But the completion report notes that no law had yet been
passed to this effect. 24 This raises the possibility that the Bank had not done due diligence
on legal issues prior to project approval. The law had still not been passed when lEG
conducted the assessment mission.           .

3.12 To conclude, while country circumstances may hamper the Bank's ability to
advocate for a single-agency model, there is still an urgent need to integrate cadastre and
registry data. While the technical means for doing this may be problematic, of much
greater concern is the foot dragging by agencies concerned to defend their turf. Project
design needs to spell out the steps needed for integration, laying out a clear timetable and
monitoring progress regularly.



4. Urban vs. Rural 1m pact
4.1      One of the objections that may be raised against systematic, nationwide
adjudication is that it involves unjustified costs (low priority areas are included as well as
high priority areas) and they tend to neglect the needs of poorer groups. Certain rural
areas may not be a high priority for land regularization. Within long- established rural
communities information on "who owns what" is typically well spread, and if there is not
a lot of mobility, transactions are typically concluded among members of the community,
with little asymmetry in information. On the other hand, in places with much mobility,
such as urban areas, newly settled frontier areas, and fertile agricultural areas,
transactions often take place among strangers and information asymmetry is significant
(the seller knows the validity ofhislher land rights, but the buyer knows less). It is these
areas where the payoff to regularizing land rights is likely to be greatest. By the same
token, if a would-be land buyer doubts the authenticity of title documents presented by
sellers, registration would alleviate such constraints on land market activities, but such
benefits would accrue in areas where land transactions are more likely to be common
(urban areas, and fertile agricultural areas, but not remote and less fertile rural areas).

4.2     By definition, systematic adjudication does not allow for this prioritization by
area. This section examines how priorities may differ between urban and rural areas.
Progress may be faster in urban areas for logistical reasons, costs per parcel are lower in
urban areas (Table 4) and, for reasons examined below, there is more likelihood that the
data on parcel characteristics will continue to be updated after the one-time sweep of
systematic adjudication is complete.

 Note: The large discrepancy between EI Salvador and Guatemala in the rural cost reflects the higher rural population density
 (smaller average parcel size) in EI Salvador.

4.3      Regularization of urban land may not only be more urgent but also more feasible
than rural land regularization. It is more urgent because the urban population is growing
faster than the rural population (Figure 4), pushing up the volume of property transactions
and increasing the challenge of land use planning and the demand for services provided
                                                   14


by municipal authorities. It is more feasible because the denser the population the cheaper
the cost of cadastral surveying. Also, urban populations are more likely to be better
informed about registry and cadastre and because they are closer to the offices they face
lower transaction costs. In towns land transactions are more frequent than in rural areas,
and they take place mostly among strangers, who therefore have a greater demand for
official verification of ownership. In addition, fertile and dynamic rural areas, which tend
to be densely settled, may also have more active land markets, and may be more
attractive to outside entrepreneurs (who are not part of the traditional community), also
offering large potential benefits to regularization. 25

4.4    In Guatemala, surveying and titling targets were exceeded for urban areas but fell
well short of the target f~r rural areas, mainly owing to weak operation on rural titling by
Fontierras (Figure 5). (There is no urban/rural breakdown in the data IEG obtained for EI
Salvador).

area-based regularization, the program covered all rural and urban parcels irrespective of
size. But, with the passage of time, the databases may degrade unevenly: property owners
who are relatively poor and remote from cadastre/registry offices are probably less
inclined to register changes now that they have to pay (Unlike systematic adjudication,
sporadic adjudication-adjudication on demand-requires that the owner pay for the
service.) In EI Salvador, the cost of on-demand regularization may dissuade poorer
clients from approaching CNR, an observation made a decade ago that probably still
holds true today. "As of 1998, the cost of registering a land area of3.5 manzanas was
$1,800. For farmers who on average earned $120 per month, this cost was definitively
excessive".26 Also, before owners can register a property they need to legalize the title, a
process that falls outside CNR's mandate and is an added cost.

4.6      The poor may be less informed about regularization procedures. Addressing this
concern, a baseline study for the Bank-supported follow-on project in EI Salvador
recommended that CNR improve its communication strategy in order "to ensure that
people know of the institution and that potential users are aware of the location of its
offices".27 CNR acknowledges that this issue needs addressing and at the time ofthe lEG
mission were seeking the funds to establish mobile units that would increase CNR
outreach in remote areas.

4.7     There is another reason why sustainability of adjudication efforts is likely to be
greater in urban areas. Establishing a reliable cadastral database allows for the more
accurate assessment of property taxes and charges for municipal services. Equipped with
information about the width of storefronts, for example, municipalities have a firm and
fair basis on which to calculate the charges made to businesses for a variety of urban
services including paving, lighting and trash collection. In Guatemala, although failure to
pay property tax does not usually lead to prosecution, the threat of withholding urban
services may be an effective lever for persuading service users to pay their taxes. This
leverage is mainly limited to built up areas however because municipalities offer fewer
services in rural areas; and the rural population typically has less means to pay. But
mayors in more commercially vibrant areas are often willing to pay cadastral agencies to
keep information up to date, helping to keep these agencies financially self-sustaining.

4.8     Collaboration between municipalities and the registry-cadastre has gone even
further in EI Salvador, and is seen as key to the ensuring that the positive results from
systematic adjudication are sustained. 28 By signing an agreement with CNR,
municipalities obtain access to existing cadastral information and a guarantee of regular
updating. With access to this information municipal authorities can assess fees for
municipal services (although, unlike in Guatemala, there is no additional revenue from
property tax). Municipalities offering a wide range of services and incurring substantial
costs for delivering these services probably have the biggest incentive to sign up; in areas
where growth and urban property development is less dynamic there is less interest in
cooperating with CNR. As of December 2009,42 of the 262 municipalities in the country
had signed agreement with CNR, up from 17 when the project closed?9 Forty of the 42

municipalities were located in the six Departments that had been covered by the
systematic registration campaign sponsored by the Bank-supported project.

4.9     Summing up, there may be more client demand for land administration initiatives
in urban areas and covering these areas is likely to be less costly and more sustainable.
Rural areas present a wide range of land planning challenges-including tenure of
indigenous communities, agrarian reform settlements and protected areas-that may call
for more urgent action than private property adjudication. The needs of these special
areas have typically been incompletely addressed or neglected by land administration
projects.



5. Land Reform Challenges
5.1      Access to land is a problem in both countries. The extent to which land holding is
concentrated in a few hands is more marked in Guatemala (where land reform was
aborted earlier) than in El Salvador. Currently, the land distribution Gini coefficient for
Guatemala is about 0.85 compared to 0.61 in El Salvador; the average for Latin America
is 0.79 and for the world 0.64. 30 In both countries there is a history oflimited access to
land by the poor. The civil wars of the 1980s were partly fueled by land hunger. Given
this similarity between the two countries it is striking that the Bank argued against land
reform in El Salvador but supported a land reform project in Guatemala, even though
land issues figured prominently in the Peace Accords of each country. In El Salvador
earlier attempts at land reform had gone further (see Table 2 above), possibly triggering
more elite resistance. The Bank clearly needed to take these political realities into
account. But this does not fully explain why Bank's analytic work and theoretical
assumptions took a different tack in El Salvador.

5.2     In El Salvador, Bank analysis found that past efforts at land reform had led to
inefficient resource use in agriculture. The reform redistributed 295,000 ha (equal to 19
percent of prime farmland) and imposed a ceiling of245 ha on holding size. 3l According
to the Bank, the reform "paralyzed land markets, deterred investment, distorted
incentives, and did little to improve tenure security because many transfers could not be
completed due to incomplete land records".32 The Bank also observed that: "there are no
private properties larger than 500 hectares; this is a significant problem, not only because
holding size limits prevent the realization of economies of scale but also because the land
reform affected 20 percent of the best farm land in the country".33 Drawing on the results
of a 1996 household survey, the Bank made the case that, in El Salvador, land reform was
not an appropriate way to reduce rural poverty. First, landlessness did not significantly
increase the propensity to be poor: 30 percent of the landless were extremely poor; but
the proportion for farmers was not much lower (27 percent). Second, the Bank estimated
that using land redistribution to bring the rural poor above the poverty line would entail

                                                      17


an increase in average farm size from 2 ha to 12.5 ha, which could not be accommodated
by the supply of land of arable potential.

5.3     The conclusion drawn was that "considering the scarcity of farm land in El
Salvador, these estimates underline the unreasonableness of relying primarily on land
redistribution to alleviate poverty among the rural poor, and the importance of non-land
factors (i.e., education, access to infrastructure and credit, technology, economic
incentives) in the poverty equation". 34 The Bank report notes that "the least poor in rural
areas are those households which are heavily involved in nonfarm employment, and thus
a route out of poverty is to increase access of the poor to non-farm activities".

5.4     By contrast, in Guatemala, the Bank was comfortable arguing that land
redistribution is justified in part by the absence of economies of scale in agriculture, in
line with an influential strand of Bank thinking at the time. 35 "Highly concentrated
ownership is a major cause of low labor and land productivity. According to official
estimates, small farms have higher yields and factor productivity, and labor use in small
farms is on average 40 percent higher, than for larger farms".36

5.5     Nevertheless, the appraisal document for the Guatemala land reform project did
refer to the Bank's earlier analytic work on El Salvador. But it used the data to argue
against past (administrative) approaches to land reform that had led to efficiency 10sses. 37
The appraisal document also drew on the El Salvador analytic work to introduce a note of
caution. "(a) Land redistribution, by itself, is not a solution to rural poverty. Without
complementary services and investments to induce technological change, production and
income levels will remain relatively low; (b) A large land distribution scheme may
trigger an increase in land prices; (c) Countries should not rely exclusively on land
reform as main instrument to reduce poverty in rural areas. Other non-exclusive options
include: promoting land rentals and sharecropping, titling and registering land, and land
taxation".38

5.6     But the design of the project failed to take sufficient account of these caveats. It
contained several mistakes, most notably a failure to contain upward pressure on land
prices, one of the shortcomings that the Bank had warned against.

5.7     First, Article 11 of the Fontierras law (which was under discussion at the same
time the Bank was preparing the project) set no limit per family on the size of the land
purchase loan. The lack of a ceiling made it less likely that beneficiaries would look hard
for cheaper properties, or bargain hard over the price. The project design was based on
the assumption that obliging beneficiaries to take on a substantial debt to buy land would
dissuade all but the most committed applicants for Fontierras financing. 39 Loans would
only be granted to applicants with viable productive projects, projects that would
generate enough revenue for the loan to be paid back. However, as it turned out, the size

of the loan could well exceed the scope of the productive project to amortize it. There
was little to stop families assuming debts that exceeded their capacity to pay. Moreover,
according to some IEG interviewees, beneficiaries were advised, covertly or overtly, not
to pay back the loans they received. Some peasant and indigenous organizations publicly
proclaimed that the poor should not be expected to pay for land. The resulting efficiency
losses could have been contained if the Bank had pressed harder for a ceiling per family
on the amount paid for land.

5.8     The absence in Guatemala of an ethic of impartial property valuation and a
trained corps of independent surveyors increased the scope for corruption. According to
knowledgeable stakeholders, various press reports, and a CEPAL study4o, properties
were frequently overpriced, with the surplus proceeds being pocketed by landlords,
leaders of peasant and indigenous organizations, Fontierras staff, surveyors and the
beneficiaries themselves. Once more, the scope for corruption would have been less if a
per-family ceiling on land purchase had been implemented.

5.9    A second design weakness arose from the lack of attention at the design phase to
ensuring that there was an adequate cadre of technical assistance providers capable of
helping land reform beneficiaries to improve farming practices and to develop and
implement business plans.

5.10 Third, although the project design included adequate eligibility criteria for
selecting beneficiaries, the rules for the selection process contained in the project
operating manual could have been tighter. Also, it seems likely that before the project
was appraised there was a long list of clients (sponsored by the various parties to the
peace process) who needed to be accommodated, rendering formal project selection
procedures moot. During the first half of implementation, the vetting of would-be
beneficiaries was limited to a sample of the group; and the eligibility assessment
questionnaire was applied in Fontierras offices, rather than where the applicants lived
(making it impossible to verify asset levels). This proved to be a significant oversight
because most of the property purchased under the project was transferred in the first three
years of implementation (2000-2002).

5.11 According to the completion report, following persistent advocacy by the project
team, Fontierras eventually changed its procedures, introducing a limit per family on the
amount of the land purchase credit. IEG found no documentary evidence of a change in
procedures; nor when asked about this were the staff of Fontierras able to confirm that
such a change had occurred. The lack of change is evident from data in the Fontierras
portfolio which shows that, even after adjusting for inflation, the mean size of the
financing package per property purchased was no lower by loan closing than it had been
at the beginning of implementation.

5.12 And yet, even if the cost per family of land purchase was higher in Guatemala
than in two other countries where the Bank supported similar projects, the amount per
family of the finance package (land plus complementary investments) was roughly the
same (Table 5). Because the complementary investments were squeezed by comparison

                                            19


in Guatemala it follows that productive projects were probably less viable; although in
the absence of farm survey data this is impossible to verify. Nevertheless, the non-
viability of many productive projects in Guatemala would be consistent with the weak
performance in repaying the land purchase loan. About 60 percent of the Fontierras
portfolio is now at risk, raising doubts about the sustainability of this agency-and the
broader commitment to market-assisted land reform.

5.13 Over the space of a decade or so the priority given to land issues in the Bank's
strategy for Guatemala has fallen off significantly. Although the lending implications
were not immediately clear, land occupied center stage in the 1995 Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS); "The land issue is central to any rural poverty alleviation and peace
                                             20


consolidation strategy in Guatemala".41 But already by the 1998 CAS, the slow progress
on reforming land administration was highlighted as one of the areas of concern in the
Bank's program. 42 Nevertheless, the land agenda was still identified as a key part of the
strategy for FY1999-200 1: "In order to improve access to sustainable productive
opportunities for the poor, the most important effort would be to help transform the
skewed land distribution pattern and clarify land tenure rights".43 In contrast, the 2005.
CAS was lukewarm about land initiatives, noting "the Fontierras project was affected by
the incongruence of the model adopted by the Govemment".44 The 2008 Country
Partnership Strategy made no reference to land issues at all even though the second land
administration project was at an early stage of implementation. 45

5.14 The shift of emphasis in the Bank's strategy was underpinned by a change in the
type of recommendations emanating from its poverty assessments. In 1995, improved
land access was central to the Bank's program. The poverty reduction strategy that was
proposed listed three key elements: "greater access to land for the poor, investments to
raise the human capital of the poor, and infrastructure and support services to increase
productivity".46 Improving land access "involves efforts not only to make it easier for the
landless and land poor to acquire land, but also to strengthen land tenure security for
smallholders who already possess land".47 By the time of the 2003 poverty assessment,
"expanding land titling and land markets programs" was still among the initiatives
recommended for support but was just one among many: neither a "top" nor a "medium"
priority.48 It was noted that: "full-fledged land reform is unlikely to serve as a major
vehicle for poverty reduction due to the high costs and slow pace of land programs, and
low agricultural returns".49 In the 2009 poverty assessment there was no reference to land
issues (titling or reform), either in relation to poverty reduction or growth. The new
emphasis was on conditional cash transfers and the region most in need of assistance was
identified as the north-east (not Peten).50

5.15 These findings raise an important question. Have the development needs of
Guatemala shifted so radically since the late 1990s as to justify this reorientation of Bank
strategy? Is land administration and land redistribution no longer relevant to the country's
needs? This is an issue that bears closer examination than it has received in the recent
analytic and strategy work of the Bank.

6. Attention to the Poor
6.1      During the design and implementation of these three proj ects there was
insufficient attention to the mechanisms needed to ensure access of the poor to the lands
regularization process and to land available for redistribution. This was manifested in the
failure to organize comprehensive targeted information campaigns, insufficient facilities
for free legal advice, inadequate low-cost dispute resolution mechanisms, no reduced
transaction fees for smallholders and socially deprived members of communities, and
inadequate monitoring of access and utilization of services by the poor.



7. Lessons
7.1     Assumptions about the boost to tenure security that will result from land
administration initiatives (and corollary assumptions about improved access to credit
and reduced conjlict) should be carefully examined and tested with empirical evidence.
The assessed projects make assertions about enhanced tenure security, increased credit
access and reduced conflict over land rights but provided no evidence to back these
claims up. There is a literature outside the Bank challenging these assumptions and the
Bank has only recently begun to take this into account. There are a number of ways to
measure tenure security and the progress toward increasing it (see paragraph 2.6 above);
and these measures need to be taken into account in project design and monitored during
implementation. Summing up, security of land tenure is not automatically boosted by
land administration initiatives; good land administration is a necessary (but not sufficient)
step toward secure land tenure.

 7.2    Integrating the databases of cadastre and registry is important to facilitate land
 use planning and tax assessments; but this integration can be attained by providing
 separate cadastre and registry agencies with a common technical platform-it does not
presuppose creation of a single cadastre/registry agency (which may not be politically
feasible). EI Salvador-with its single agency-has made more progress toward technical
integration than Guatemala with its separate agencies. A unified agency is preferred, if it
can be politically established. If a unified agency is not politically feasible, effective
arrangements for data integration must be introduced, otherwise the unsatisfactory
experience of Guatemala will be repeated in other places. There are steps that can be
taken during project design and implementation to make it more likely that integration
will be effective (see paragraph 3.3 above).

7.3     Land administration initiatives need to be prioritized by geographic area; other
development programs may be more appropriate for remote rural areas. Regularization
may be more urgent, more feasible and more sustainable in urban areas and in fertile rural
areas with dynamic land markets. Urban regularization could usefully be accompanied by
complementary efforts to improve municipal services, municipal financing and slum
upgrading. In rural areas, there is more of a need to adopt an integrated approach to land
in private property, protected areas and indigenous communities (the last two typically
having been orphaned in land administration projects). While a majority of the poor often
                                                 22


live in rural areas it does not follow that land administration efforts should give special
attention to rural areas; there may be more effective ways to reduce rural poverty.

7.4     The problems associated with Guatemala's attempt at market-assisted land
reform need to be avoided in subsequent projects; there is much scope for learning from
previous design flaws and factors tending to undermine government support-the
relevance of land reform should not be lightly dismissed. The justification for the drop off
in the government and the Bank's support for land reform in Guatemala and EI Salvador
merits closer examination. lEG concurs with the findings of a recent Bank policy note:
"Considering the pervasive and pernicious inequality of land distribution in Central
America and the fact that these inequalities were a major factor that led to civil unrest and
civil wars, it is sobering to note that World Bank land projects in Central America have
ended up focused on land administration ... with a secondary and discontinued effort at
piloting market-based land purchase programs".51 In

7.5      During the design and preparation of land administration and land redistribution
projects mechanisms need to be developedfor ensuring that the poor will have access to
the land administration process and to opportunities for obtaining land; and the.
effectiveness o/these mechanisms needs to be continuously monitored. The three projects
assessed here each listed poverty reduction as one of their objectives and yet there was
little follow up to ensure that the poor were well served. In the case of land
administration, systematic adjudication in principle covers poor and non-poor alike. But
coverage of the poor should not be taken for granted; and once systematic adjudication is
complete there is a need for special measures to encourage poorer groups to register
subsequent changes in landholding. With respect to land reform, the eligibility criteria for
participation in redistributive schemes should give weight to the needs of the "poor with a
vocation for farming" and application of those criteria should be based on a systematic
survey of the socioeconomic profile of the candidates. Also, for land policy initiatives to
make a big impact on rural poverty complementary measures are called to boost
agricultural productivity.

7.6     The net gains from land administration and land reform initiatives should not be
regarded as self-evident; much more attention must be given to measuring the impact of
these initiatives and this means that when projects are prepared-rather than later-
provision must be made for conducting baseline and follow-up surveys with appropriate
control groups. None of the three projects assessed here made adequate provision for
impact evaluation. This shortcoming is not limited to land policy projects; but because
these projects are politically so problematic the analytical foundation on which they are
based probably needs to be more carefully designed and carried out than is the case for
many other types of projects.

Summary
This report assesses the performance of the US$70 million Land Administration Project. The
project was supported by an IBRD loan (No. 3982) ofUS$50.0 million, which was approved
on March 5, 1996. All but US$80,000 of the loan disbursed and it closed on June 30, 2005,
after being twice extended for a total of three years.

The project's major objectives were to regularize land registration for EI Salvador's estimated
1.6 million parcels of rural and urban land and to create an efficient, streamlined, and
financially self-sustaining nationwide cadastral mechanism for mapping and land
registration-the new National Registry Center (CNR). According to the appraisal report,
land registration would provide land owners-particularly the vast majority of smallholders
who lacked clear tenure-with tenure security, enabling them to sell or rent at fair market
prices, and pass on their holdings as inheritances. In addition, it was argued that enhanced
tenure security would increase smallholder access to credit, raising incentives to invest and to
manage land properly.

The project comprised: (a) Institutional Strengthening and Decentralization (planned cost,
US$1 0.6 million; actual cost, US$16.7 million), which involved establishing the institutional
framework, structure and procedures for the introduction of an integrated, nationwide
cadastre and land registry; (b) Land Data Acquisition (planned cost, US$48.7 million; actual
cost, US$41.3 million), which entailed mapping, regularization of land records and the
development of alternative mechanism for resolving land disputes; and (c) Project
Administration (planned cost, US$1 0.7 million; actual cost, US$11.4 million), which
covered the cost of preparation, plus the strengthening and expanding of the project
implementing unit that had been created under the pilot project.

IEG rates Outcome as satisfactory. Both the design and the objectives of the project were
substantially relevant. Although there are some doubts about whether land tenure was
generally as insecure as assumed at appraisal, the focus on increasing efficiency by creating a
unified cadastre and registry was appropriate and the improvement of land use capacity is
particularly important for the fast-growing urban areas of EI Salvador. The project
substantially achieved its objectives. Only two-thirds of the projected number of parcels was
covered but this was what was feasible with the available funds (the cost per hectare of
regularization was underestimated at appraisal). There are signs that the project boosted the
dynamism of land markets with potentially efficiency-enhancing consequences. More
importantly, registry and cadastre procedures were greatly improved and CNR achieved core
financial self-sufficiency, serving as a model for other countries. The unit costs for
regularization were in the range observed elsewhere.

The Risk to Development Outcome is rated moderate. Notwithstanding a concern that the
cadastre and registry databases may not be kept up to date (because the poor may not have
the means or incentive to register future changes in property holding), the essential solvency
of CNR and the progress made with the signing of municipal agreements are encouraging
indications that the project's principal achievements will be sustained.
                                              26


Bank Performance is rated moderately satisfactory: there were some flaws in quality at
entry (including the lack of provision for monitoring and evaluati,on and the failure to verify
that legislation allowing CNR to retain its revenue surplus was in place) but supervision was
intensive, demonstrating the necessary flexibility in response to changing circumstances.

Borrower Performance is rated satisfactory based on consistent government support for the
project and the sound leadership ofCNR.

The Lessons learned from this project are discussed in the Overview report which draws on
findings from lEG performance assessments of three Central American land policy projects.

Background
1.1     The 1992 Peace Accords marked a new departure for EI Salvador, including a
commitment to regularize land tenure. In 1994 the government formulated a new agrarian
policy with substantial assistance from the Bank. 52 The new policy aimed to: (a) finalize the
land transfers agreed to in the Peace Accords; (b) strengthen security of tenure; (c) streamline
state agrarian reform institutions; (d) restructure agrarian debt; (e) create a free market for
land; and (f) implement an efficient system of rural finance. 53 The Land Administration
Project responded to the second item on this agenda: the demand for stronger tenure security.
It aimed to consolidate and modernize land registry and the cadastre, drawing on the results
ofa pilot conducted in the Department of Sonsonate that was financed under a Bank-
supported project approved in 1993. 54

1.2      According to one estimate, before the Land Administration Project, most of those
occupying land had title to it (Table 1) but there was no updateable system to record and
manage land-related information. This hampered development of the land market. It also
denied government access to vital information needed for planning. As well as addressing
these issues the Project indirectly supported a process of individualizing land tenure rights,
consistent with new legislation that enabled members of agrarian reform cooperatives to sell
or rent their land to anyone they chose. 55 A further legislative initiative underpinned
preparation of the Project. In December 1994 the government merged three agencies to create
the National Registry Center (CNR), unifying the functions ofland mapping, cadastre and
registration. 56 The decree creating CNR required it to charge a fee for services sufficient to
make the agency self-financing.

National Republic Alliance Party (ARENA) and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front Party (FMLN), The FMLN (now the party in power) had sufficient votes to block the
passage of items requiring a two-thirds majority, such as foreign loans requiring a sovereign
guarantee. For reasons that were not project specific FMLN chose to vote against the loan

and the Social Land Registry (RSI). ING was in charge ofthe cadastre, RPRH was a deed registry (grantee-
based not land-based), and ISR was responsible for registering titles in squatter settlements.

supporting the Second Land Administration Project and a raft of other operations (including
some sponsored       bi
                      other donors). The Second Land Administration project was canceled in
September 2006.    5 Nevertheless, the Centro Nacional de Registros (CNR) signed a loan
agreement for a similar project with the Central American Bank for Economic Integration;
and it is still hoping to negotiate a new project with the World Bank.

Project Overview
Objectives

2.l     According to the Loan Agreement, "the objectives of the Project are to: (a) modernize
the Borrower's public registries and the cadastre of real estate; and (b) establish the bases for
land regularization in the Borrower's territory".58

2.2      The statement of project objectives in the appraisal report is more explicit and, for
that reason, is used as the template for this assessment. "The proposed project's major
objectives are to regularize land registration for EI Salvador's estimated 1.6 million parcels of
rural and urban land and to create an efficient, streamlined, and financially self-sustaining
nationwide cadastral mechanism for mapping and land registration-the new National
Registry Center. Land registration would provide land owners-particularly the vast majority
of smallholders who lack clear tenure-with the security that will enable them to sell or rent
at fair market prices, and pass on their holdings as inheritances. Improving tenure security
would al~o increase smallholder access to credit, raising incentives to invest and to manage
land properly".59 The appraisal report also assigns the operation to the "Program of Targeted
Interventions against poverty because, although all land will be regularized and benefits will
accrue to all, of the currently unregistered parcels, more than three quarters are small".6o

2.3      The statement of project development objectives has two footnotes. The first defines
terms: "Land regularization makes ownership rights public knowledge by perfecting
registration procedures and making all records public". The second clarifies the project's
territorial coverage, stating that there are 1.8 million parcels in EI Salvador but the project
would cover only 1.6 million because 200,000 parcels in the region of Sonsonate were
already being regularized under a pilot operation (PRISA) that preceded the appraised
project. Except for Sonsonate, the project was intended to cover all 14 departments ofEI
Salvador, spanning both urban and rural areas.

2.4       The objectives were not revised during implementation.

Components

2.5     Institutional strengthening involved consolidating CNR following the three-agency
merger (see paragraph 1.2 above). Accounting norms needed establishing along with a fee-
for-service schedule that would allow CNR to be financially self-sustaining. Provision was
made for integration of the registry and cadastre databases and the further computerization of
land information. This included creating the Land Information System, an automated
database developed under the PRISA project to identify owners, parcels, and their
descriptions, rights, and encumbrances.

2.6    Decentralization entailed setting up, in addition to CNR headquarters in San Salvador
(Central Region), three regional offices in Sonsonate (Western Region), San Vicente
(Northern Region) and San Miguel (Eastern Region). In addition, land registry and cadastre
operations were further decentralized to 52 municipal offices. Each regional office offered a
one-stop window for the full menu of services.

2.7     Land data acquisition comprised mapping (to establish a parcel-based database
describing every parcel's legal rights, geographic location, and boundary lines), land records
regularization (which included legislation to make registration by notaries compulsory and
universal), and development of a range of mediation procedures for resolving disputes over
rights to parcels. One of the major regularization tasks was to convert the real estate files of
CNR from the system of/olio personal (grantee-based files) to the system of/olio real
(parcel-based files), including the identification of the legal status of each parce1. 61

2.8    The components were not revised during implementation. The cost of the Institutional
Strengthening component was just over double the appraisal projection but this was
accommodated by lower than projected costs in other components.

Project Institutional Framework

2.9     The project implementing agency was the CNR, a decentralized agency under the
Ministry of Justice with administrative and financial autonomy. Under the PRISA-funded
pilot operation CNR set up a Project Executing Unit (PEU), which was expanded under the

61. World Bank (2005b), p. 3.
                                               30


Land Administration Project. The PEU was headed by an international manager who
reported to the CNR Executing Director through a National Coordinator appointed by the
CNR Board. This coordinator was responsible for ensuring smooth liaison with government
and the private professional associations involved in the project. 62

Implementation

2.10 The project was approved in March 1996. Loan effectiveness (March 1997) and the
mid-term review (May 1999) took place on the dates projected at the inception. There were
two extensions of the closing date and ultimately the loan closed (in June 200S) three years
later than originally expected. This was the result of the unsatisfactory performance of the
international contractor in the department of Santa Ana, and difficulties in completing the
procurement process for the international competitive bidding for San Salvador, owing the
difficulty of finding contractors who met the bidding standards and requirements. Also, the
1998 Hurricane Mitch and the 2001 earthquakes delayed project implementation because
equipment was lost and loan resource had to be reallocated to cover some emergency
infrastructure work. Field work had to be rescheduled and postponed for several months after
both the hurricane and the earthquakes.

2.11 At appraisal, the total project cost over five years was estimated at US$70 million, to
be financed by an IBRD loan ofUS$SO million, and US$20 million from the government.
The actual project cost over eight years was US$ 69.S million, of which US$ 49.9 million
were from proceeds of the IBRD loan, andUS$ 19.6 million from the government. The
government released counterpart funds promptly throughout implementation. Loan funds
were disbursed and used in accordance with Bank guidelines. Audited accounts were
generally maintained satisfactorily.

2.12 Although total project costs did not exceed predictions, unit costs were higher than
expected, which explains why only two-thirds of the targeted number of parcels were
covered. There was some underestimation at appraisal of the number of parcels per hectare.
Since the surveyors were paid per hectare the surveyors faced the prospect of financial loss if
the number of parcels per hectare was routinely higher than predicted. (In urban areas the
influx of population leads to the fragmentation of lots, creating more boundaries to be
traced.) The initial estimate of unit costs did not take sufficient account of the difficulties
encountered in the field verification of legal rights and the delimitation of buildings. This in
tum reflected the limited experience and capacity of local firms and consultants, the lack of
an adequate methodology for surveying densely populated rural areas, unforeseen difficult
terrain in various rural areas, and deficiencies in the operating manual which failed to define
responsibilities clearly resulting in duplication or shortage of efforts. The poor quality of the
original data in the old system required clean-up efforts that had not been budgeted for. Also,
owners were often not on hand when regularization was carried out, complicating the
verification of rights. Finally, the high incidence of criminality in some areas of the country
hampered fieldwork. 63

Relevance
Relevance of Objectives

3.1      The government (and the Bank) perceived land tenure insecurity to be one of the
impediments to investment in agriculture and improved natural resource management. The
contribution of legally secure land ownership to peace consolidation and environmental
management was recognized in the 1993 Country Assistance Strategy. Also, the 1994
Poverty Assessment identified a need to increase the poor's access to assets through
strengthening the agencies responsible for land financing, titling, and registration. 64
Nevertheless, at the time of appraisal, the evidence of tenure insecurity was limited. Lack of
title did not seem to be a major problem. CNR reported that during the systematic
regularization of Sonsonate only about 5 percent of land owners were found to lack title. A
Bank survey found that 83 percent of rural households hold title to land (see Table 1 above).
There is no discussion in the appraisal report of the level of tenure insecurity, or if there are
significant variations in tenure security between different regions or between urban and rural .
areas. However, the appraisal report does single out EI Salvador's botched land reform of the
1970s as a prime cause of tenure insecurity: "the reform program paralyzed land markets,
deterred investment, distorted incentives, and did little to improve tenure security because
many transfers could not be completed due to incomplete land records". 65 The lack of
analysis at appraisal concerning the precise nature of insecurity calls into question the
relevance of the tenure security objective.

3.2      Although project objectives sought to encourage investment in land, it could be
argued that the absence of a property tax meant that there was no spur for farmers
underutilizing their land to rent or sell up (inhibiting transfer of land to producers more likely
to use the land fully and invest in it). There has long been stiff resistance to the imposition of
such a tax in EI Salvador. (On the other hand, in several countries where a property tax does
exist it is laxly enforced (e.g. Guatemala); so in practice the spur it provides to intensification
may be moot.)

3.3     A more compelling argument for relevance of project objectives concerns the likely
efficiency gains from modernizing the cadastre, based on the single-agency model that EI
Salvador had pioneered. The results of the pilot project demonstrated that modernizing the
land registry and cadastre was cost effective. 66 However, the efficiency gains from a
modernized and unified cadastre/land registry apply mainly where there is a high level of
land transactions, and where land information is frequently needed for planning and taxation
purposes. This would seem to point to particularly high relevance in urban areas and perhaps
in more fertile agricultural areas.

3.4     Based on circumstances before the project, the focus on promoting registration made
sense. Only 40 percent of properties were registered; less than a third of these had cadastral
references. Many properties with valid registrations could not be located. Property owners

with title certificates that were not registered could not use their titles as security for
mortgages. Some properties were registered by municipalities but this practice did not
guarantee their legal rights before third parties. 67

3.5    Another argument for relevance centers on EI Salvador's development trajectory.
More than 60 percent of the population now lives in towns; and there is a substantial problem
of urban squatter settlements associated with rural outmigration. Rural population density
(population per hectare of farmland) has fallen since 1975 (unlike neighboring Guatemala).
The project concept was consistent with the aim of increasing the revenue base and
improving land use planning; the strengthening of the registry/cadastre is a vital adjunct to
urban development.

3.6     In the time between project implementation and closing project objectives were
wholly in accord with the three Bank Country Assistance Strategies that corresponded to this
period (Table 3). After the project closed, however, land policy issues ceased to feature in the
Bank's Country Assistance Strategy; and this was the case at the time of lEG's assessment
mission. 68 The omission apparently reflects the higher priority that government and the Bank
are now giving to the fiscal and social sector concerns occasioned by the worldwide
economic downturn, rather than reversal of an earlier policy. Admittedly, the Second Land
Administration Project was canceled in September 2006. But this followed from the absence
of the necessary votes in Congress for loan to be made effective (a two-thirds majority is
required for multilateral development loans to be ratified).69 This outcome has been
interpreted more as a tactical strike against the administration by opposition parties rather
than a vote of no confidence in the project itseleo In short, the lack of reference to land
administration in the current strategy seems to be more of a conjunctural phenomenon rather
than reflecting a fundamental waning of commitment to the principle of developing registry
and cadastre institutions.

Relevance of Design

3.8     The commitment to a single-agency model for registry and cadastre was consistent
with Bank thinking about good practice. 71 Experience elsewhere has shown that delays and
bottlenecks, due to rivalries and conflicting interests, are inevitable when a number of
competing land agencies are simultaneously responsible for the implementation of land
administration projects.

3.9     The focus on developing agreements with municipal authorities was congruent with
the urban land use planning and fiscal decentralization needs of the country. Another positive
aspect of design was the decision to allow private surveying firms and non-government
organizations to bid for contracts rather than financing all fieldwork through force account.
The project design allowed for rapid delivery of key outputs (e.g., maps, cadastre, and
computerized database) that would help to build commitment from decision makers. The
plan to adopt an automated (rather than a manual system) was ultimately justified by

efficiency gains; the project made adequate provision for the extensive training that the
switchover entailed.

3.10 In some respects the design was over ambitious. It embodied an optimistic
assumption that conditions in Sonsonate (the pilot region) were broadly representative of the
rest of the country: Sons onate was more developed and less remote than conditions in many
other parts helping to explain why the unit costs in the pilot were substantially less than those
of the full-scale project that followed. Trying to cover the whole nation was, with the benefit
of hindsight, too big a stretch; and even if this target had been achievable it may not have
been justified. The design could have prioritized areas where the land market was most
active-most likely towns or the more fertile rural areas. Also, the legislative changes needed
to make registration by notaries compulsory and universal proved not to be achievable. It
might have been more practical to rely on executive decree rather than banking on swift
action by the legislature. 72 Moreover, although the Staff Appraisal Report suggested
possible impact indicators the design of monitoring and evaluation was limited to tracking
physical and financial outputs rather than development outcomes. No provision was made for
a baseline survey, complicating any subsequent attempt to assess impacts. 73 Project design
did not provide for specific monitoring of the extent to which the poor have access to (and
make use of) project-generated activities and services.

3.11 However, these caveats are outweighed by the path-breaking nature of the single-
agency model that the project championed. The relevance of project design is, on balance,
rated substantial.

Overall Rating

3.12    Overall, relevance is rated substantial.

Efficacy
4.1     The Project Development Objective (see paragraph 2.1 above) can be broken down
into the following parts: first, regularization of rural and urban land parcels in all the
administrative departments of El Salvador except Sonsonate; second, increasing the
efficiency of land markets; third, increasing the security of tenure of landowners (particularly
small farmers); fourth, facilitating access to bank credit; fifth, creating efficient registry and
cadastre procedures; and sixth, ensuring that registry and cadastre institutions were self-
financing. Although poverty reduction was not included among the project's specific
objectives some consideration of the likely consequences of this intervention for the ~oor is
in order because this operation was designated at appraisal as a targeted intervention. 4

  *The ICR lists data from the previous pilot project here, comparing Sonsonate with another "without project
  department", Usulutan. This is not relevant because Sonsonate was not included in the Land Administration
  Project that is being assessed here.

Parcel Regularization

4.2     The appraisal target was to regularize the registration of 1.6 million parcels. By loan
closing 1.0 million parcels had been regularized. The remaining 600,000 parcels had still not
been fully regularized when lEG conducted its November 2009 assessment mission. The
shortfall is attributed to the higher than expected costs of regularization. The cost estimates at
appraisal were based on experience from the Sonsonate pilot; but, in terms of level of
development and extent of land titling this was a comparatively unproblematic department of
the country, so costs here were not likely to be representative of the rest of the country.
Additionally, the Project completed the regularization of the 100,000 parcels in Sonsonate
Department, work begun under the PRISA-financed pilot operation.

4.3     There is a concern about the completeness of the regularization process. The project
sought to unify all the topographical and legal information of the parcels covered through
systematic area-based regularization, creating a new, digitalized base that would seamlessly
connect registry and cadastre. In three of the six departments covered by the project (La
Libertad, La Paz, San Salvador), this process remained incomplete when implementation
ended; it was partially complete in the other three departments (Sonsonate, Ahuachapan and
Santa Ana).75 Two of the persons interviewed by lEG referred to the incompleteness of data
conversion and linkage. A notary observed that the problem arose when the landowner was
absent from the property when the surveyors arrived; in some cases the survey team was
denied entry. A consultant referred to a specific case in La Paz (one of the "completed"
departments) where, after adjudication, it was necessary to pay US$2,000 for a re-survey to
rectify measurement of a property of 100 manzanas.

4.4     Although the number of parcels covered was less than expected, it was still
substantial. The apparent shortfall was in relation to an unrealistic target that, in turn, derived
from the underestimate at project appraisal of the cost per hectare of regularization. Given
that the final cost per hectare 'Yas in the range observed for other countries (see Efficiency
section below), progress toward this objective is rated substantial.

Efficiency of Land Markets

4.5     Did the project help to make land markets in EI Salvador more efficient? Efficient
markets tend to be associated with higher level of sales compared to less efficient markets
where information gaps about rights to land and parcel characteristics may discourage
transactions. 76 One way to gauge the program's impact in this respect is to compare, first, the
level of sales per year before and after project implementation; and, second, areas covered
early on by a registration sweep (barrido) and other areas covered later, or still awaiting
coverage.

4.6      Figure 1 shows that over the period covered by the land registration program in EI
Salvador, sales picked up substantially, particularly in rural areas. When the level of sales is
broken down by program phase the picture is more complex (Figure 3) but still shows that
there was a dramatic increase in land sales coinciding with project implementation (but also
influenced by GDP growth rates and the availability of mortgage finance and remittances-
all of which contracted sharply after the worldwide downturn in 2007). In the absence of
good baseline data and follow-up surveys it is impossible to say how much of the observed
increase in property sales was attributable to the project; but the data at least admit of the
possibility that there was a significant project impact. Although correlation does not mean
causation, it is at least possible and maybe likely that the initiative to regularize property
titles, with its attendant publicity and outreach efforts, may have helped energize land sales.

While the global financial crisis and economic downturn within EI Salvador seems to have
dampened these sales, they remain much higher than at the outset of the project.

      Salvador (systematic registration completed between 2001 and 2005, under Land Administration Project
      I); Phase 3: Departments ofChalatenango, Cuscatian, Cabanas, San Vicente, Usulutan, San Miguel,

4.7     Is there a price premium to systematic registration? In the economic analysis
conducted for preparation of the (aborted) Bank-supported follow-on project it was estimated
that as a consequence of applying the regularization sweep (barrido) to departments
previously untouched by the program there would be a 17 percent increment in the property
price relative to the "without project" case. 77 The raw data on trends in rural land prices
make it hard to substantiate the existence of such a premium, based on simple comparison of
departments by program phase (Figure 4) but, in the absence of a more detailed econometric
analysis controlling for other differences between departments these results are in no way
conclusive. (Also, it is not clear why prices spiked in Phase II Departments in 2001.)

4.8      Because the data are not inconsistent with a project-induced, efficiency-enhancing
rise in property transactions the achievement of this objective is rated substantial.

Tenure security

4.9     lEG was unable to find any data on tenure security: either in terms of surveys of
beneficiary perceptions of changes in security due to regularization; or in terms of changes in
the level of conflict over ownership rights and boundary disputes. The Procuradoria General
de la Republica mediates in some boundary disputes (providing an alternative to the courts)
and its records show a sharp acceleration in the number of cases attended since 1999, mainly
reflecting the opening of new offices in the various departments. But it is unclear what
proportion these cases represent of the total number of conflicts. The Land Administration
Project included a small component to develop alternative dispute resolution mechanisms
(which would be particularly relevant to poor people unable to afford legal representation)
but CNR indicated that this activity did not proceed. The lack of data does not, of course,
mean that the security objective was not achieved. It is reasonable to suppose that
regularization reduced uncertainty for those transacting in land (and the willingness to pay
for registration suggests that the payers believed that their security would be enhanced). But
this implies improved security for selected groups in certain areas (e.g., towns); most likely
not the poor. The sustainability of this achievement is addressed in the section on Risk to
Development Outcome.

4.10   Based on the data deficiencies progress toward this objective is rated modest.

4.11 According to the completion report, "as a result of secure tenure, preliminary studies
carried out upon the project's closure indicate that owners in both urban and rural areas have
had better access to the formal credit market".78 This may be so but the evidence limitations
make it hard to draw a definitive conclusion. IEG was only able to obtain department-
specific data for rural areas (drawn from the 2007 agricultural census). This limited evidence
offers some support for the ICR claim about the positive effect of systematic registration on
credit access. Private banks probably have tougher requirements than other lenders for proof
of land ownership and parcel characteristics: access to credit from this source is a good test
of whether registration makes a difference in terms of credit access. Table 5 above shows that
the mean access to bank credit for farmers in the departments covered by systematic
registration was higher than for the departments not covered by this program; only one of the
six "registered" departments (San Salvador) showed a lower rate of use of private bank credit
compared to the mean for non-registered departments. But without a before/after comparison
this finding is inconclusive. Also, it is not clear whether the departments are similar enough

78. World Bank (2005b), p. 5, citing Carcach (2005).
                                                40


in terms of level and source of income, and growth rates for the comparison to be
meaningful. Moreover, to conclude that the project enhanced credit access presupposes that
the actions of other donors have been controlled for: while the project was being
implemented there were concurrent initiatives by USAID and IF AD to strengthen financial
intermediation in rural areas, opening new offices and attempting to increase outreach to the
pOOr. 79

4.12      Given the importance of these caveats progress toward this objective is rated modest.

Efficiency of procedures

4.13 CNR installed a fully automated and decentralized information system (SIRyC)
which stores and links legal and cadastral/geographical data for each registered land parcel.
The system provides timely and reliable information. By loan closing, 10 departmental
offices were opened (compared to the target of 4 specified at appraisal), covering about 90
percent of the population. Service users were able to access SIRyC directly through terminals
installed in the departmental offices and in 4 municipalities. To contain costs it was decided
during implementation not to set up the expected 52 municipal offices. But cooperation
agreements were signed with 17 municipalities for the exchange and maintenance of
cadastral information. Ten of these municipalities have been connected to and trained in the
management of the SIRyC. In these municipalities, SIRyC has become the basis for the local
government land planning and tax revenues.

4.14 An important indication of efficiency is the time needed to register a real estate
transaction. The completion report says that this fell from 38 days in 1997 to 16 days in
2005. 80 There has been further progress since the loan closed. lEG found.that in
September/October 2008 the average time needed to register a real estate transaction was 7
days in the 6 departments that had completed the systematic registration program, compared
to the 19 days in those departments not yet systematically registered. 8! Even within the area
covered by systematic registration there was substantial variation, ranging from 3 days in
western department of Ahuachapan to 10 days in the capital, San Salvador. These figures
compare favorably with the Bank's Doing Business indicator: in 2008, according to that
source, it took 31 days to register property. The reason for the large discrepancy between the
Bank survey finding and lEG's own finding is not apparent. The reference property
worldwide for the Bank survey was a commercial enterprise in a periurban setting.
Generally, transactions in towns are faster to expedite than those in rural area. In other words,
it was to be expected that the data for the project (which emphasized rural areas) would point
to a longer delay than that reported in the Bank survey.

4.15 Finally, a significant efficiency gain concerns the reduction in petty corruption.
According to one source, "petty corruption in the old registry was rampant".82 Now that
customers can freely access information on-line from the capital and the regional offices of
CNR there is no longer any need to bribe officials to obtain the requisite documentation.

4.16       Progress toward this objective is rated substantial.

Financial self-sufficiency

4.17 At loan closing, a cash flow projection of CNR was carried out for the 1996-2015
period to determine the agency's capacity to continue financing the modernization process. A
baseline scenario was developed and a sensitivity analysis was made to calculate the CNR's
likely surplus. The analysis showed that CNR was capable of financing the loan and the
counterpart contribution. 83 By the time that the LAP 1 loan closed the CNR had fully lived
up to appraisal expectations concerning its financial self-sufficiency, despite the weakness of
the incentive to do so. Incentive was lacking because any surplus generated was transferred
to the Treasury and could not be retained by CNR for investment purposes. The sharp
increase in income between 2001 and 2002 (Figure 1) was mainly driven by a 25 percent
increase in the average fee for property registry services (RPRH). There has been no increase
in the property registry fee since December 2001. The property registry generates two-thirds
of CNR' s total income, the balance deriving mainly from the commercial registry service (28
percent); cadastre services (including agreements with municipalities) account for only 2
percent of CNR's income.

4.18 Since 2005 CNR's cash flow has deteriorated somewhat, reflecting mainly a sharp
rise in operating costs after 2004 (Figure 5) relative to the growth of CNR incomes.
However, it could be argued that project costs (which in addition to World Bank funding for
LAP 1 include funding by the Central American Bank for a follow-on operation) should be
allocated to the government's budget rather than CNR since it is quintessentially a public
good that is being provided. In this respect it is important to note the difference between the
costs resulting from a one-off process of systematic adjudication-where costs might
reasonably be borne by the government and funded through an externally funded project

83. World Bank (2005b), pp. 26-27.
                                                    42


because the aim is to jump start institutional development-and the subsequent costs arising
from the "regular business" of on-demand, sporadic adjudication (where costs are borne by
the person requesting the service). If project costs are subtracted, CNR is still financially self-
sufficient. The recent leveling-off of its operating costs increases the likelihood that this
outcome will be sustained.

4.19     Progress toward this objective is rated substantial.

Targeting the Poor

4.20 There is a risk that whatever achievements the project made, they are not shared by
the poor, a relevant consideration given that the appraisal report designates this project as a
targeted intervention. The poor may be less informed about regularization procedures.
Addressing this concern, a baseline study for the Bank-supported follow-on project
recommended that CNR improve its communication strategy in order "to ensure that people
know of the institution and that potential users are aware of the location of its offices". 84
CNR acknowledges that this issue needs addressing and at the time of the IEG mission were
seeking the funds to establish mobile units that would increase CNR outreach in remote
areas.

4.21 Although parcel information needs to be up-to-date if bank loans are to be secured,
the transaction costs that banks bear to extend credit to small landowners may debar even the
"regularized poor" from obtaining credit. This may lessen the incentive for the poor both to
seek credit and to report changes in ownership rights and parcel characteristics. Indeed, few
rural landowners seek credit from private banks-a mere 3 percent according to the 2006
agricultural census. Even though the census data suggest that the project had some impact on
use of bank credit by farmers as a whole (paragraph 4.15), the evidence is not strong enough
to support firm conclusions and the impact for the poorest farmers is likely to have been
slight.

Overall Efficacy Rating

4.22 Overall, efficacy is rated substantial, because progress toward four of the six specific
objectives was rated substantial.

Efficiency
5.1     The economic rate of return was not estimated, either at appraisal or for the ICR. The
ICR does refer to cost effectiveness indicators. It notes that the appraisal assumption that
both institutional development and regularization activities could be realized at a cost of
$40/ha was not realistic. The final estimate was US$85/ha, compared to US$200/ha in
Indonesia and US$80/ha in Thailand. 85 IEG was informed that the actual cost of systematic
adjudication for the departments covered by the project (excluding the institutional
overhead) varied from US$19/ha in the San Salvador Metropolitan area to US$51/ha in La

Libertad, averaging US$28/ha for the whole area covered. 86 Thus, the institutional overhead
is high in relation to the actual cost of carrying out a systematic registration.

5.2      The key point is that the achievement of objectives was rated substantial and the cost
of this effort was within the range observed for other countries. Moreover, the evidence
adduced in previous sections on increased efficiency of procedures (paragraphs 4.13-4.16)
and the core financial self-sufficiency of CNR (paragraphs 4.17-4.19) has a particular bearing
on the efficiency rating. Taking all of these factors together efficiency is rated substantial.

Outcome
6.1      Given that relevance, efficacy and efficiency are rated substantial, the outcome rating
is satisfactory.

Risk to Development Outcome
7.1     The institutional framework established by the project is the strongest guarantor of
sustainability. CNR has emerged as a center of excellence, an international exemplar of an
efficient, single-agency approach to registration and cadastre. The Project set up an efficient
and reliable decentralized cadastre and title registration system for real estate property,
covering the entire country, and this progress has since been consolidated. There is now full
capability for map production. Private surveying was promoted by the project and continues
to flourish. CNR has developed high service standards, reflected in the awards conferred on
several of its units. The main risk to development outcome lies at the local level: more still
needs to be done to strengthen the ability of municipalities to maintain the parcel-based
property registry and to provide land administration services. 87

7.2     The sustainability of the parcel-based property registry has probably been enhanced
by the various cooperation agreements that CNR has signed with municipalities. 88 Signing
an agreement with CNR ensures that, for a fee, municipalities can obtain the cadastral data
they need to charge for municipal services (e.g. the amount charged to a store for street
lighting was a function of the linear footage of the store front, precise measurement of which
could be derived from the cadastre). Thus, municipalities offering a wide range of services
and incurring substantial costs for delivering these services arguably had a bigger incentive
to sign up with CNR than municipalities offering few services. As of December 2009,42 of
the 262 municipalities in the country had signed agreement with CNR; 40 of these were
located in the six Departments that had been covered by the registration sweep (barrido)
when implementation of the first project ended (Table 6).

7.3     The level of coverage of CNR municipal agreements bears on the sustainability of the
land administration initiative in two ways. First, the agreements are an annual cash inflow to
CNR; but, at around US$150,000 per year, this amounts to less than 1 percent ofCNR's
2009 income. (By December 2009 they had had generated a cumulative amount of
US$541,645). Second, and more important, municipalities with agreements have an incentive
to report any changes in ownership and physical characteristics of property, helping to keep
the cadastre and registry database up to date; and saving CNR the expense of commissioning
a new sweep (barrido) if the accuracy of the database is eroded. Table 6 shows that the
coverage of agreements is patchy (only 39 percent of municipalities have signed up) and the
sign-up date was often well after the sweep is completed, possibly reducing the accuracy of
the database. Nevertheless, nationwide, the number of municipalities signed up, rose from 17
when the loan for the first project closed to 42 today. 89

7.4     Since the project closed CNR has made further progress in bringing its offices up to
internationally-certified standards (the ISO 9001 process). Between 2006 and 2009 the
offices in San Salvador, Santa Ana, Sonsonate and Ahuachapan were all certified to be in
line with the international norms both for property registry and for update of the cadastre.

7.5     The other sustainability consideration relates to the financial self-sufficiency of CNR.
Despite some recent deterioration in its cash flow the CNR is, for reasons given in paragraph
above, still essentially solvent. The recent shortfall is largely driven by the economic
downturn which has reduced the volume of transactions and, thereby, CNR's revenues from
service fees. There is a strong positive correlation (0.95) between the growth in GDP and the
growth in CNR's income. 9o Since macroeconomic management is sound it is reasonable to
assume that growth will resume and that when it does so CNR will once again be in the
black.

7.6     The long-term impact of regularization is unclear. Although, in the first instance,
given the systematic nature of the regularization sweep (barrido), the program covered all
rural and urban parcels irrespective of size, it is possible that, with the passage of time, the
databases may degrade unevenly: property owners who are relatively poor and remote from
CNR offices are probably less inclined to register changes. The cost of sporadic
regularization may dissuade poorer clients from approaching CNR, an observation made a
decade ago that still holds true today. "As of 1998, the cost of registering a land area of 3.5
manzanas was $1,800. For farmers who on average earned $120 per month, this cost was
definitively excessive. 9 ) Before owners can register a property they need to legalize the title,
a process that falls outside CNR's mandate and is an added cost.

7.7    Notwithstanding the concern about the possible degradation of databases over time,
the continuing core solvency of CNR and the progress made with the signing of municipal
agreements point towards a risk rating of moderate.


Monitoring and Evaluation
Design

8.1    A comprehensive M&E system was envisaged at appraisal, including a suite of
impact indicators, but the system was never developed. No steps were taken to conduct the
baseline survey that had been proposed. Monitoring arrangements were incomplete when the
loan became effective.

Implementation & Use

8.2     An attempt was made to improve the M&E system and to retrofit a baseline, taking
into account inputs from the Bank's regional assessment of land administration projects.
Monitoring of the project's physical and financial execution was broadly satisfactory.
Monitoring activities-information collection, analysis, reporting and presentation-
developed during the Project were further refined in the preparation of the second-phase
operation (although this did not ultimately disburse).92

8.3      The M&E component of the project was not well designed; nor was it given sufficient
priority. As a consequence, it was not possible to derive reliable conclusions regarding land
market activities, credit utilization, and productivity of farms, land values, access and
utilization of land administration services by the poor and overall return to the project.
Therefore, the quality of monitoring and evaluation is rated as modest.

Bank Performance
Quality at Entry

9.1     The Project was consistent with the spirit of government strategy, including the Peace
Accord principles. It was also fully in line with the Country Assistance Strategy which
emphasized the need to modernize the public sector and to facilitate private sector growth.
Specifically, the Project was timely in its support to the government's attempts to modernize
the real estate registry and establish a single land agency. The Bank cooperated closely with
the government and the National Registry Center (CNR). Staffing and skill mix from the
Bank's side appear to have been adequate during the project preparation phase. On the other
hand, there was a failure to assess to what extent tenure security was really lacking in El
Salvador, or to consider how it varied between different areas (denying the possibility of a
geographically-focused intervention). Also, little attention was given to designing
mechanisms for ensuring benefits to the poor and, as noted above, monitoring and evaluation
design was weak. 93 The appraisal estimate of the cost per hectare of regularization proved to
be unrealistic based as it was on a questionable extrapolation of experience from the
Sonsonate pilot (see paragraph 4.2 above). The appraisal report states that the legislature had
approved CNR autonomy and self-financing by allowing CNR to retain its revenues. 94 But
the completion report notes that no law had yet been passed to this effect. This raises the
possibility that the Bank had not done due diligence on legal issues prior to project approval.
The law had still not been passed when lEG conducted the assessment mission. 95

9.2       Quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory.

Supervision

9.3      The frequency and intensity of supervision was appropriate. There were four task
managers during project implementation but all were land administration specialists with
broad project experience so there was no loss of supervision continuity or quality. The Bank
did its best to minimize project delays resulting from procurement difficulties by stepping up
the supervision effort and pressuring the procurement agent to provide CNR with the
assistance needed to execute large work contracts. In response to the procurement problems
the Bank gave timely approval to an extension of the Project's closing date. Also, in the
wake of natural disasters, the Bank responded flexibly in approving the reallocation of funds
for emergency civil works. 96

9.4     Quality of supervision is rated satisfactory.

Overall Rating

9.5    Where there are differences in the sub-ratings on Bank performance the IEG-OPCS
convention is to base the overall rating on the lower of the two sub-ratings. Therefore, Bank
performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

Borrower Performance
Government

10.1 The Project received sustained support from the highest levels of government.
However, effectiveness was delayed by one year, owing to the time taken to negotiate two-
step Congressional approval. Also, approval of key legal reforms was delayed because of
difficulties in passing new laws in a Congress that was politically divided. Once the loan was
made effective counterpart funds were delivered on time. 97

10.2    Government performance is rated satisfactory.

Implementing Agency

10.3 CNR provided consistently strong leadership. When there were problems with the
quality of regularization works, CNR developed several technical operational manuals,
provided comprehensive training to private contractors, established a supervision unit, and
set up a quality control mechanism. There was continuity in the staffing of the agency. CNR
also adjusted quickly to the emergencies arising from earthquakes and Hurricane Mitch. The
one shortfall in its performance concerned the excessive delay in establishing an adequate
monitoring and evaluation system.

10.4    Implementing agency performance is rated satisfactory.

Overall Rating

10.5    Overall Borrower performance is rated satisfactory.

Summary
This report assesses the performance of the US$36 million Land Administration Project. The
project was supported by an IBRD loan (No. 4415) ofUS$31.0 million, which was approved
on December 3,1998. Three extensions were granted and the loan closed on March 31, 2007,
almost four years later than originally anticipated.

The project was intended to be the first phase of a twelve-year program that would cover the
whole country. The first phase (1997-2002) would cover six of Guatemala's administrative
departments with the World Bank project supporting work on the single department of Peten.
The objectives ofthe Project were: (i) to increase legal security ofland tenure in the Peten
Department; and (ii) to strengthen the legal and institutional framework for land registry and
cadastre services in Peten.

The project comprised the following components: (a) Cadastre and Land Regularization
(planned cost, US$27.2 million; actual cost, US$21.7 million), which involved mapping,
field-level participatory data acquisition and clarification of property claims, demand-based
title adjudication to eligible beneficiaries, conflict resolution supervision and quality control
and maintenance; (b) Land Registry (planned cost, US$2.2 million; actual cost, US$I.2
million), which entailed the opening of a new registry office in Peten and design of an
integrated registry and cadastre system; and (c) Project Management (planned cost, US$5.2
million; actual cost, US$10.9 million), which covered capacity building of the
implementation unit, studies on land legislation, preparation of proposals for the integrated
parcel-based cadastre and registry system, review of registry and cadastre tariffs, and survey
of the status ofland tenure in various areas of the country.

lEG rates Outcome as unsatisfactory. While the objectives of the project were substantially
relevant the design of the project contained several flaws, including the questionable
appropriateness of Peten as locus of the operation. Although the project successfully
developed a parcel-based geographical cadastral database, contrary to appraisal expectations,
there is no technological platform for integration with the deed-based registry database. Also,
targets for cadastral surveying and titling were not met. Data inconsistencies raise questions
about the 27 percent rate of economic rate of return that the completion report claims.

The Risk to Development Outcome is rated significant. Since project closing there has been
no progress toward integration of the cadastre and registry data bases, raising the possibility
that project investments will not lead to an enduring improvement in tenure security.

Bank Performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory: there were several flaws in quality at
entry (including concerns about the wisdom of selecting Peten as a starting point; and the
limited provision for monitoring and evaluation); these flaws were only partly offset by an
intensive supervision effort. Borrower Performance is also rated moderately unsatisfactory:
although one of the implementing agencies (UTJ/RIC) performed soundly, government
support for project objectives was lackluster and the other implementing agency (Fontierras)
failed to reach rural land titling targets.

The Lessons learned from this project are discussed in the Overview report which draws on
findings from lEG performance assessments of three Central American land policy projects.

 Background
  1.1      Land policy issues lie at the heart of the reconciliation process that was initiated by
  signing of the Peace Accord on December 29, 1996. This formally marked the end of thirty-
  six years of civil conflict. The Accord included specific commitments to establish: (i) a
  decentralized, cadastral-based land registry; (ii) a land fund to promote market-driven land
  reform; (iii) land conflict resolution mechanisms, with particular reference to the needs of
. indigenous communities; (iv) a national geographic information system; (v) a
  comprehensive land tax system; (vi) agricultural development; and (vii) rural investment
  programs. 98 Under the Accord an Inter-institutional Commission for the Development and
  Strengthening of Land Property Rights (Protierra) was set up to provide oversight of the
  initiatives taken in support of the Accord commitments.

1.2     Land administration in Guatemala has for more than a century been held back by the
lack of systematic data on the geographical characteristics of land parcels, reflecting the
absence of cadastral institutions. There is a corresponding inability to cross-reference the
geographical data on parcels with the legal data on ownership rights that is contained in the
General Property Registry (RGP). This failing in principle reduces tenure security and limits
the incentive to invest in property development, including improvements to farming. The
land administration program that was supported by the Bank in the wake of the Peace
Accords sought to address this deficiency.

1.3      There was limited scope for creating a new agency that would handle both cadastre
and registry functions. This is mainly because RGP (which dates back to 1877) is one of the
most autonomous entities in the country. The Registrar is appointed by the President of the
Republic, and because the institution does not receive regular budget transfers (operating
with its own revenues), it is not subject to the standard fiduciary controls of other public
entities. 99 The special status of the RGP creates particular challenges when it comes to
integrating RGP's deed-based registry database with the parcel-based geographical database
that was being developed.

Project Overview
Objectives

2.1      The project was intended to be the first phase of a twelve-year program that would
cover the whole country. The first phase (1997-2002) was originally intended to cover six of
Guatemala's administrative departments with the World Bank project supporting work on the
single department of Peten. According to the appraisal document, "the objectives of the
Project are: (i) to increase legal security of land tenure in the Peten Department; and (ii) to
strengthen the legal and institutional framework for land registry and cadastre services in
Peten".IOO This statement of objectives is consistent with that given in the Loan Agreement.

2.2      The objectives for the first phase and the program as a whole were the same. The
statement of objectives for both project and program said that goals would be "achieved
through a participatory process for conflict mitigation and resolution that includes indigenous
and non-indigenous communities".IOI With respect to the sector-related goal in the Bank's
Country Assistance Strategy it was noted that: "This project will contribute to poverty
alleviation and exclusion reduction, by providing the basic input for efficient, equitable and
sustainable land management in Peten: land rights information and knowledge". 102

2.3      The preamble to the statement of long-term goals that is contained in the
government's "letter of development program" stated that: "Land administration is a
continuous process whereby land information is captured, recorded, maintained and
analyzed. This process is crucial for the appropriate management of land and forest
resources, for regional and urban planning, for better monitoring of land-related conflicts, in
addition to being the fundamental technical support for ascertaining land tenure security.
Establishing a national land administration program is a long and expensive process,
particularly because accurate data ought to be collected at the parcel level, reviewed at
several stages to ensure its quality, and maintained. This requires a firm and long-term
commitment from the government in accordance with the Peace Accords". 103

2.4      The project's objectives were not revised in the course of implementation, although
the 2003 mid-term review resulted in a clearer specification of the indicators and targets
underpinning these objectives. 104 A slight extension of the geographic area covered by the
project, involving selected municipalities in Alta and Baja Verapaz was approved in April
2005.

Components

2.5     According to the development program letter, "the outputs of the Program will be:
(i) Digital maps for the entire country; (ii) Eligible beneficiaries titled; (iii) National multi-
purpose integrated cadastre and registration system". 105 In the case of the Bank-supported
project, these outputs would be derived from separate components for cadastre and registry.

2.6     Cadastre and Land Regularization involved the mapping of the Peten cadastre, in-
field adjudication upon demand, and data processing of areas subject to regularization. The
component was intended to establish a parcel-based cadastre that could be integrated with the
registry system. Specific activities comprised mapping, field-levelland data acquisition,
conflict resolution, supervision and quality control, and maintenance and updating of
mapping data.

2.7     The Land Registry component entailed support to the decentralization of registry
offices to departments, as mandated by the 1985 Constitution. When the project was
appraised there were only two registry offices in the country, located in the cities of
Guatemala and Quetzaltenango. The component financed the opening of a new registry
office in Peten and design of an integrated registry and cadastre system. This was designed as
a pilot exercise, which would lay the foundations for a nationwide rollout.

2.8    Financing of the Project Management Unit included an allocation for studies to
review and propose appropriate land legislation, make proposals for the integrated parcel-
based cadastre and registry system, review registry and cadastre tariffs and potential new
products and survey the status ofland tenure in various areas of the country. 106

2.9     The components were not altered during project implementation.

Institutional Framework

2.10 Cadastre and registry functions in Guatemala are handled by separate agencies,
respectively the National Geographic Institute (IGN) and the General Property Registry
(RGP). Another agency, Fontierras, was responsible for titling rural national lands. Titling of
urban lands was handled by each of the 12 municipalities of Peten. The project was carried
out under the aegis of the Ministry of Agriculture. The Ministry headed two commissions
responsible for policy and coordination, the Inter-Institutional Commission for the
Development and Strengthening of Land Property Rights (Protierra) and the Peten Land
Commission (CTP), the latter responsible for adjudicating land in the department. The
Presidential Land Office for Conflict Resolution (Contierra), created in 1997, played a
supporting part, providing mediation and other alternative conflict resolution mechanisms
and legal assistance on demand, as well as social monitoring. 107

2.11 Project operational matters were handled by coordinating units located in Guatemala
City (UTJ) and in the nascent registry office in Peten (UTEC). In June 2005, project
implementation responsibility shifted from UTJ to the Registry of Cadastral Information
(RIC), an autonomous public institution responsible for establishing, maintaining, and
updating the cadastre. "This law effectively replaced a temporary unit created by decree
(UTJ) with a permanent entity created by law". 108

Implementation

2.12 Although the project was approved by the Bank's Board in December 1988 it was not
approved by the Guatemala Congress until March 2000. Between 1997 and 2000, the
implementing agency (UTJ), carried out pilot activities in the Municipality of San Francisco
using resources from a project preparation facility (PPF). Government approval of the project
was delayed by debate in Congress about the new land law and by the run up to general elections
in 1999. The Land Law was approved by Congress in May 1999 and its regulations were
completed in May 2000. The completion report concluded that Congress was
"understandably" reluctant to endorse a project loan before clarification of the national land
rights framework. 109 (This reasoning rather undercuts the rationale for the decision to carry out
the project in the Peten region: according to the appraisal document, that province was selected
as a starting point because, as a special frontier region, it already had its own land law, enabling
the project to make a head start before the national law was passed.)

2.13 The project closed in March 2007, almost three years later than expected. The
project's closing date was extended three times. The first extension was granted from June
30, 2003 until May 31, 2005 and was intended to help make up for nineteen-month delay
between Board approval and loan effectiveness. The second extension was granted from May
31, 2005 to May 31, 2006. The Government requested this extension in order to take
advantage of the Bank's recently-approved changes in financing procedures which allowed
for more flexible counterpart funding arrangements. A third and final extension was granted
from May 31, 2006 until March 31, 2007, the reasoning being that rural titling still needed to
be completed and there was also the need to provide a bridge until Phase II of the Adaptable
Program Loan could begin.110

2.14 In April 2005, the geographic scope of the project was expanded slightly to include
selected areas in the border area between the departments of El Peten and Alta Verapaz. The
extra costs resulting from this expansion were covered by savings generated through work on
the cadastre in the urban parts of Peten. By 2002 the implementing agency (UTJ) had
developed the capacity to implement land regularization activities in urban areas on its own,
so it was no longer necessary to subcontract the work to foreign firms, thereby reducing costs
(and helping to strengthen local capacity).

2.15 Implementation of the project was impeded in four ways. First, the transfer of
counterpart funds from government to the implementing agency was erratic. Second, the RIC
Law was not approved by Congress until June 2005. This law effectively replaced a
temporary unit created by decree (UTJ) with a permanent entity, an autonomous public
institution responsible for establishing, maintaining, and updating the cadastre. The delay in
setting up RIC meant that cadastral procedures developed under the Project were in legal
limbo for about five years. Third, UTJ was slow to launch the international bidding process
for rural land regularization work. This activity was vital for meeting rural surveying and
titling targets. Given that the international contract represented roughly one-fifth of the loan,
its delay by about two years substantially delayed implementation. By loan closing in March

2007, the most significant shortcoming was the limited number of titled rural properties. This
problem was aggravated by a fourth implementation shortfall: Fontierras, the agency
responsible for titling of rural lands, performed poorly, proving unable to keep up with the
rapid pace of the cadastral survey work.

2.16 The Bank carried out a thorough mid-term review between May and October 2003,
seeking to remedy the implementation delays. Monitoring and evaluation was strengthened,
with UTJ henceforth reporting at least quarterly on progress toward the agreed targets. The
international contract to implement regularization activities in rural lands was signed in May
2003. Also, as a result of mid-term review recommendations, the project team worked more
closely with the General Property Registry in an attempt to redress delays in the development
of an integrated cadastre-registry information system. III

Relevance
Relevance of Objectives

3.1      The objectives of the project were central to the broader program laid out by the
Peace Accord and enjoyed government support at the highest level. Before the project was
appraised, the centrality of land policy issues to the government's development agenda had
already been demonstrated through the creation of Protierra when the Accord was signed in
1996. (The broad remit of Protierra is set out in paragraph 1.1 above.) This framework helped
to ensure that land regularization was not treated in isolation, but approached as one part of a
larger process, including new approaches to land reform (supported by the Bank under the
complementary Land Fund Project that was launched simultaneously). The operation in
Peten was part of a concerted effort, involving similar initiatives elsewhere in Guatemala.
Other donors (European Union, Netherlands, Germany, and Sweden) supported smaller
pilots in other parts of the country, under the leadership and coordination of Protierra.

3.2     It would appear that the continuing relevance of the project's objectives was
substantiated by passage of the Cadastral Information Registry (RIC) Law in August 2005
and the government's strong support for a Phase II. The two Bank country assistance
strategies that spanned the lifetime of the project make explicit commitments echoing the
project objectives (Table 2). Also, the literature from the academy and from advocacy
organizations leaves little doubt that the objective of strengthening the security of land tenure
is of paramount importance for Guatemala. 112 Aside from enhancing tenure security, the
project had another valid objective. Giving the municipalities a cadastre would enhance the
information base they needed to collect property taxes and service fees (particularly in urban
areas), thus helping to underpin local-level development. Based on these considerations the
relevance of project objectives is rated substantial.

Relevance of Design

3.3       The commitment to a long-tenn, phased operation (funded through an adaptable
program loan) made sense. It can take from 10 to 20 years to build cadastre and registry
institutions and to develop efficient and sustainable processes of land administration. (A
similar approach, involving four projects, bore fruit in Thailand.)lI3

3.4    There were other positive aspects to project design. First, it incorporated lessons
learned from a similar pilot in neighboring EI Salvador. These lessons included the
importance of a launching a publicity campaign in each area before survey work began and
the need to develop mechanisms for resolving land conflicts that did not involve a lengthy
and expensive process through the courtS.114 Second, the emphasis on decentralization was

justifiable on equity and efficiency grounds given that, when the project was prepared, clients
had to go to Guatemala City to register their land, facing considerable transaction costs.

3.5     But there were also some weaker points in the design. The choice of Peten as the
program starting point was not self-evident. The appraisal document does not discuss the
tenure issues in Peten in any detail except to note that this is a "colonization" area with a
history of disputed settlement, I 15 while also conceding that there may have been a greater
need for regularization in the more densely- settled Altiplano. 116 But Peten was thought to be
more suitable as a pilot. The government requested that the program start in Peten and the
Bank accepted. The appraisal document cites several reasons for this choice, including the
following:

          The existing Peten 1971 Land Law allowed the government to cadastre and
           adjudicate land-not the case in the rest of the country because there was no national
           cadastre law. (The cadastre pilots carried out elsewhere in Guatemala by other donors
           only included a physical cadastre, with neither titling nor registration.);
          Most of the Peten lands were formally not under private tenure but belonged to the
           nation, facilitating the title adjudication process;
          The adjudication of national lands was being handled in lots of 45 ha (due to soil
           fragility), thus allowing for economies of scale;
          A Social Assessment conducted during project preparation indicated that, relative to
           the rest of the country, land conflicts were least common in Peten;
          The General Property Registry (RGP) had all registered Peten properties (about
           10,000 records) scanned and available on-line;
          Peten was a priority area for Peace Accords as most of its population was poor. 117

3.6      These justifications at appraisal somewhat overstated the extent to which land
regularization in Peten would be unproblematic. In commenting on the completion report, the
government observed that in the three decades between the start of adjudication of Peten and
the Peace Accord an informal land market had developed, creating uncertainty about the
rights of land users and generating conflict. I 18 Academics and advocacy groups have between
them generated an abundant academic literature about land conflict and dispossession of
peasant farmers in Peten. 119 This is a frontier region which has a long history ofland grabs;
most recently associated with the traffic in narcotics (because it is so lightly populated and
policed Peten is a favorite spot for the landing strips used by small aircraft that ship cocaine,
by stages, from Colombia to the United States). There are several accounts, in the press and
the academic literature, of peasant farmers being harassed into giving up their land. 120 Faced
with this extra-economic coercion and in the absence of a broader framework of law and
order it makes little difference whether farmers hold legal title or whether the characteristics

of their parcels are accurately recorded. Legal security of land tenure is not likely to have
much relevance in an area characterized by lawlessness and disregard for legal status.

3.7    If tenure security is to be enhanced by this type of project it is important that the
process of regularization be embedded in a wider program to strengthen law and order and
reduce the scope for physical coercion of property owners. This wider commitment was
missing when the project was prepared and its absence was particularly marked in Peten.
These considerations were not mentioned in the appraisal document.

 3.8     Moreover, even if the project had succeeded in Peten, in the absence of a nationwide
 law for land administration, it would have remained at best an island of success, with little
demonstration effect. What needs to be remembered is that the project only got underway
when the nationwide law was passed (although this was not a condition for loan
effectiveness), thus removing one of the basic rationales for starting in Peten anyway. The
approach to adjudication set out in the appraisal document may be characterized as
"systematic, with a caveat". 121 Systematic adjudication aims to cover all the parcels in a
given area, regardless of the socio-economic status of the property right holder, and is
preferable to sporadic adjudication (which involves coverare "here and there, now and then")
because it is more equitable and yields economies of scale. 22 But under the terms of the
Peten Land Law, certain people holding national land may not have been eligible to do so
and de jure may have been required to hand the land back to the nation. This possibility
might have reduced demand to participate in the adjudication process-leading to gaps in
coverage and a patchy cadastre/registration database. Although, in keeping with the demand-
driven approach adopted by the project land holders had the right to opt out of the
adjudication process the appraisal document describes this risk as "negligible" because the
part of the Law referring to land seizure had never been enforced. 123 (Also, the publicity
campaign in advance of adjudication may have made a powerful enough case for the
advantages of adjudication to offset any misgivings on the part of potential clients.)
Moreover, a condition of project effectiveness was reform of the Peten Land Law to remove
these sources of uncertainty about the status of holders of national lands. 124 (The law was
superseded by the 1999 Fontierras Law, which was regulated in 2000.)125

3.9     If the overarching objective of the country program was to promote growth there are
other questions to be raised about the choice of Peten as a starting point for the land
administration push. A Bank study found that Peten had middling potential for agricultural
growth compared to other parts of the country: "The Northern and Peten Regions have
moderate to high productivity soils ... but these areas have limited access to infrastructure". 126
The study found weak incentives to invest in Peten relative to other parts of the country.
"Results for Peten are somewhat troubling as low returns to assets compound the problems of
low mean asset levels. Higher returns to all assets in North and Northwest regions might
induce asset migration into these areas, but few incentives exist for the private market to

improve asset bases in Peten. Aggregate returns in Peten to these assets are sufficiently low,
most likely because many households in the region lack complementary assets to raise
returns to existing ones". 127

3.10     There is a further consideration: Peten had only 4 percent of all the poor in
Guatemala and 3 percent of the extreme poor. 128 The 2004 Bank study recommended that
rural development investments give priority to the Western Altiplano on the grounds that "if
the development objective is to reach the largest number of poor [it is preferable to] invest in
a variety of social and productive household assets in high potential areas with the high rural
poverty densities" .129 Given the frontier characteristics peculiar to Peten it is valid to ask to
what extent lessons learned and procedures developed here could subsequently be
generalized to other parts of Guatemala, which is what the program sought to do.

3.11 The completion report also notes that "project design suffered from a few weaknesses
related to readiness for implementation, monitoring arrangements, and a weak legal framework
which limited the operational capacity of the Project's implementing agency"Yo One indication
that the project was not ready for implementation concerns the failure to provide measures to
ensure that the three agencies jointly responsible for cadastre, titling and registration would work
together effectively. Lack of coordination and integration are significant and predictable
sources of risk when the functions are handled by different agencies and the design should
have included credible arrangements, as well as budgets and performance indicators to
contain and detect such risks. Also, the limited provision for monitoring and evaluation was a
significant design flaw given that this was essentially a pilot operation and the first-phase of
a long-term program: in order to fine-tune the design preparatory to nationwide rollout it was
important to have in place a system capable of generating information about project
performance.

3.12 In addition to the poor arrangements for monitoring and evaluation in general, there
was an absence of baseline data about land markets or land values or access to credit, all of
which the project was claiming to affect. This project could have looked more closely at EI
Salvador's Land Administration project, which at the time of the Guatemala appraisal
mission, had been under implementation for over a year and had no baseline data. The
appraisal for the Guatemala project included a social assessment with focus groups and
interviews. It could have used the opportunity to gather information on the land market as
well, if it existed. The presentation of the project introduced a hypothetical economic rate of
return, which remained hypothetical ex post because of absence of data on land values.

Efficacy
(i) Increase legal security of land tenure in the Peten Department

4.1     In order to assess progress toward this objective it is important to know how much the
lack of tenure security is explained by the deficiencies in the cadastre and registry that this
project was intended to remedy. In the absence of a controlled comparison between farmers
in the same district who were and were not covered by land regularization it is impossible to
conclude that, even if the project had met its targets, there would have been any increase in
tenure security resulting from the project.

4.2     As it is, the project fell substantially short of its targets. It is difficult to say by exactly
how much there was a shortfall because the units of measurement underpinning the targets
("parcels", "municipal areas", "hectares") varied between appraisal and completion.
Nevertheless, the completion report makes it clear that the lack of progress was confined to
rural areas, mainly reflecting weak performance by Fontierras on titling. With respect to
cadastral survey, 64 percent of the target for rural areas was met. But only 3 percent of the
target area was covered (if the reference point is areas that were titled as well as surveyed)
(Table 3).

4.3     There is another indication that progress was limited. The municipality of San
Francisco was the first part of Peten to be covered by the project (at the request of the
mayor). Pilot work began in 1997-2000, before the loan was made effective. Yet in 2008,
roughly a decade since work began, only 55 percent of the 5,174 parcels that had been
covered by the cadastral survey were logged in the database of the General Property
Registry. \31 The mismatch between the cadastral and registry databases is likely to be even
greater in other municipalities that were covered later. Inadequate provision for agency
coordination at the project design phase (paragraph 3.12) increased the likelihood of this
outcome. Until the data on the physical characteristics and location of properties is congruent
with the description of ownership rights in the registry it is difficult to talk of a significant
increase in tenure security. According to one account, the dynamism of land markets in Peten
is such that the survey data that were collected in all probability no longer reflect the reality
of today' s pattern of use and ownership rights. 132

4.4     At the time oflEG's mission in December 2009, although cadastral surveying targets
had been exceeded, the full process of regularization had not been concluded in any of the 12
municipalities, reflecting delays in the judicial process, the lack of appropriate technology for
storing the data and the absence of agreement on matters such as tariffs.

4.5     On the other hand, there has been some progress in addressing land-related conflicts.
The completion report states that "the project facilitated the opening of three new regional
branch offices of CONTIERRA, the Presidential Commission for Resolution of Land Conflicts,
to increase the outreach to project beneficiaries. The offices provided bilingual and free legal
assistance to municipalities and beneficiaries. In addition, participatory conflict management
programs for municipal mayors and beneficiaries were organized. As a result of these efforts,
between 1998 and 2007, 1,266 land conflict cases in the project area were submitted to
                                                   72


CONTIERRA, of which 78 and 79 percent of urban and rural cases, respectively, were
satisfactorily solved".133 The completion report also notes that the "participatory and conflict
resolution methodology is accepted".134 In 2008 and 2009 Peten was the department with the
largest number of new conflicts reported to the agency responsible for resolving land
disputes. Peten has 3 percent of the population of Guatemala and 10 percent of the people
reporting land conflicts (Table 4). This does not necessarily mean that the project was
ineffective in tackling conflict in Peten: if the presence of CONTIERRA shines a spotlight on
disputes that were previously unacknowledged it will serve a useful purpose. Nevertheless, it
is of some concern that around 15 percent of these conflicts were triggered by the
regularization process itself. 135 Also, the published numbers on reported conflicts probably
still understate the total number of conflicts. "Key land experts emphasized that up to tens of
thousands of additional disputes ... remain latent or umegistered".136

4.6      Progress toward this objective is assessed as modest.

(ii) Strengthen the legal and institutional framework for land registry and cadastre
services in Peten

4.7     In 2005, five years after loan effectiveness, the law establishing the Registry of
Cadastral Information (RIC) was passed; but regulation of the law was still pending when the
loan closed. RIC is an autonomous public institution responsible for establishing,
maintaining and updating the cadastre. In support of RIC's mission, the project accomplished
a series of tasks, including establishment of a basic geodetic network, aerial photography,
mapping and the marking of municipal boundaries.

4.8    The registry office that was opened in Peten helped to speed up the exchange of
information between the province and the headquarters of the General Property Registry
(RGP) in the nation's capital. Persons in Peten wishing to register property transactions no
longer had to incur the expense of traveling to Guatemala City.

4.9     An international survey conducted by the World Bank showed that the time taken to
register property in Guatemala dropped significantly after 2005 (Figure 1). There was no
corresponding target for this indicator in the project but given that the project closed in 2007

it is not unreasonable to assume that some of the post-2005 improvement was attributable to
reforms in the General Property Registry (RGP) that were supported by the project. There
was no exact correspondence between the time estimates in the Bank survey and the
estimates given to lEG by the property registry (also the case in EI Salvador) but both
sources showed a downward trend in processing time. RGP said that the time taken to
register property now averages 5 working days. Since passage of the 2005 cadastre law
registration should also involve an obligatory stop at the cadastral office; but so far this has
not been enforced. Guatemala lags EI Salvador in this respect (and therefore has made less
relative progress than Figure 1 suggests).

4.10 The project successfully developed a parcel-based geographical cadastral database
but, contrary to appraisal expectations, it had not been integrated with RGP's deed-based
registry database at loan closing. 137 Integration had still not been achieved when lEG
conducted its mission in November 2009. Also, although cadastral data is available on-line,
in RIC's offices, there are no computer terminals available for use by the public.

4.11 A further concern is the lack of evidence that cadastre and registration procedures
were made more accessible to the poor-attention to the poor being part of the project's
overarching purpose (see paragraph 2.2 above). The completion report addresses poverty
impact by arguing that there were a significant number of poor people in Peten and then
makes the inferential leap that the poor must have benefited from the increase in property
values. 138 The completion report does not discuss the appropriateness of access mechanisms:
whether the communications campaign had sufficient outreach to poor and indigenous
groups; whether the conflict resolution process was tailored to the poor; or whether there was

4.12 On a more positive note, one of the results flowing from the establishment of a
cadastral database is the possibility of more accurately assessing property taxes and charges
for municipal services. Thus, equipped with information about the width of storefronts,
municipalities have a firm and fair basis on which to calculate the charges made to
businesses for a variety of urban services including paving, lighting and trash collection.
Although failure to pay property tax does not usually lead to prosecution, one mayor told
lEG that the threat of withholding urban services is an effective lever for persuading service
users to pay their taxes. This leverage is mainly limited to built up areas however because
municipalities offer fewer services in rural areas; and the rural population typically has less
means to pay. Nevertheless, this is one illustration of how cadastral surveying can contribute
to fiscal decentralization. Given this incentive, mayors-particularly those in more
commercially vibrant areas-are often willing to pay cadastral agencies to keep information
up to date, helping to keep these agencies financially self-sustaining.

4.13 Given the continuing failure to integrate the cadastre and registry databases (which
substantially reduces the return to the investment thus far made in regularization), progress
toward this objective is assessed as modest.

4.14    Overall, efficacy is rated as modest.

Efficiency
5.1     At appraisal it was estimated that the project's economic rate of return would be 12
percent. The completion report re-estimates the rate of return at 27 percent. Given that final
project costs were 92 percent of the appraisal estimate and that there was a substantial
shortfall in meeting the target for rural surveying and titling, it is not clear how the level of
net benefits needed to support a 125 percent increase in the rate of return was generated. lEG
was unable to find any additional data in the course of this evaluation that might support the
re-estimate.

5.2     The implementing agency (RIC) did however su~ply lEG with a consultant report
that was prepared as an input to the completion report. 13 This report presents detailed
estimates of the area actually cadastered and titled and the increment in land values resulting
from this regularization process. The area and price estimates (which are purportedly based
on data supplied by RIC and by real estate agents in Peten) are significantly different from
those finally presented in the completion report, showing that the aggregated increment from
increased land values was less than the total cost of the project (Appendix B, Table B1). The
discrepancies in the core data between the completion report and the consultant's input call
into question the reliability of the re-estimated rate of return.

5.3     Because of these inconsistencies, efficiency is rated modest.

Outcome
6.1   Given that the rating of relevance, efficacy and efficiency is in each case modest the
outcome rating is unsatisfactory.

Risk to Development Outcome
7.1    The passage of both the Fontierras Law in 1999 and the Registry of Cadastre
Information Law (2005) helped to strengthen the foundations of land administration in
Guatemala and thereby reduced risk that the project's regularization efforts will be
undermined (although only the second of these laws fell under the project remit).

7.2      However, although the Bank-supported follow-on operation (approved in December
2006)140 provides an opportunity to consolidate what was achieved by the first project, at the
time of the lEG mission in November 2009, several issues left over from the earlier operation
had not been resolved. Little progress has been made in clearing up the rural titling backlog
in Peten. The integration of the cadastral and registry databases has stalled and, according to
many of those interviewed by lEG, communication between RGP and RIC was sometimes
strained. As the completion report observed, this failure to integrate the databases could
"threaten the reliability of some of the cadastral information obtained through the project.
Over time, this could lead to a reinformalization [sic] of land transactions, as people lose
faith in the accessibility, reliability, and overall value of registering transactions". 141
However, some steps have been taken to strengthen working relations between the cadastre
agency (RIC) and the registry (RGP). A cadastre-registry committee has been set up and the
technical linkages have been established to enable the initial steps of the cadastral process to
be undertaken.

7.3      The risk to development outcome is rated significant.

Monitoring and Evaluation
Design

8.1     There were some design weaknesses. The indicators bearing on project development
objectives mixed up measures of output, outcome and impact. There were no quantified
baselines or specific target values. In particular, there was no baseline for beneficiary living
standards, for land markets or for environmental conditions. The appraisal made no provision
for measuring progress in delimiting municipal boundaries, an essential part of

Implementation and Use

8.2     There was limited attention paid to monitoring and evaluation before 2003 and
reporting on performance indicators was inadequate. The 2003 Mid-Term Review tightened
up the specification of indicators and targets and established a timelier schedule for reporting
on progress. 143 Data obtained from this project helped inform preparation of the second
phase.

8.3      The quality of monitoring and evaluation is rated as modest.

Bank Performance
Quality at Entry

9.1     The Bank played a critical role in the Peace Accords that underpinned the project. 144
During the 1997 Country and Sector Administration Review the government asked the Bank
to playa coordinating role and provide technical assistance on land administration. The Bank
rose to this challenge providing sound advice to government during the preparation. 145

9.2      Quality at entry was rated satisfactory by QAG although with some reservations
about project readiness for implementation and the failure to allow for direct cost recovery.
QAG applauded the project's focus on reducing exclusion and mediating land conflicts, the
fruit of a thorough social assessment which had highlighted the gravity of these issues in
Peten. 146 According to the completion report, particular care was taken during preparation to
consult with and facilitate participation by indigenous communities, in line with OD 4.20
(although the project did not address indigenous lands' rights issues directly).

9.3      But lEG identifies several shortcomings in quality at entry. First, there are concerns
about the choice of Peten as a starting point for the Bank-supported program (see paragraphs
3.5-3.10 above). Second, there was inadequate attention in the design to mechanisms of
coordination and integration of data between the cadastre and registration agencies; this lack
of integration could nullify the value of the investment in a detailed cadastre. Third, the
design of, and provision for, monitoring and evaluation needed to be stronger. This was a
pilot and there was no evaluation plan/design adequate to establish its effectiveness. There
was no baseline survey on beneficiaries, land markets, and access to credit: subsequent
phases of this adaptable program loan would depend for their justification on evidence of
progress against the baseline. Also, the monitoring indicators identified at appraisal were not
realistic. Fourth, the time needed for project implementation was underestimated. Targets

with the UN. This has involved providing technical advice to the mediation team on financing issues and
technical and institutional issues associated with selected peace accords (indigenous, socioeconomic and
agrarian topics). Implementation of these accords will provide enhanced access by the poor and indigenous
communities to land, productive assets and basic social services. The Bank is also doing some preparatory work
to mobilize donor support for eventual implementation of a Peace Plan, beginning by convening an Informal
Donors Meeting in Paris in June 1995" (World Bank, 1995b, p. 9).

were unrealistic, to the extent that at the mid-term review they were cut by more than 40
percent. Fifth, although the executive branch of government may have been willing to press
ahead in Peten, the legislature evidently took a different position. Those who prepared the
project appear to have misread Congress's position and underestimated its power to hold up
approval of the loan. If Congress agreed to go ahead in Peten because of its unique legal
situation, why did it delay approving the project until a federal land law had been passed
covering the whole country?

9.4     Quality at entry is rated unsatisfactory.

Supervision

9.5     Supervision was timely and the Bank provided close support at three critical
moments: the hiatus between approval and effectiveness (1998-2000); the "credibility crisis"
faced by the General Property Registry (2003); and the transition when RIC replaced UTJ as
implementing agency (2005-2006). The comprehensive Mid-Term Review (May-October
2003) strengthened project implementation substantially. It addressed the earlier neglect of
monitoring and evaluation by filling gaps in the specification of targets, specifying indicators
more precisely and increasing the frequency with which UTJ was required to report on
performance. The 톖ong delay in the international bidding for rural land regularization was
brought to an end. Pressure was brought to bear on the General Property registry to enter
more seriously into dialogue about the procedures needed to integrate registry and
cadastre. 147

9.6     However, there are some questions about the extent of coordination with other
donors. Before passage of the RIC law in 2005, the other donors (Germany, Spain, Sweden,
Netherlands, and European Union) had halted work on the bilateral land regularization
projects that were proceeding in various parts of the country, in an attempt to pressure the
government to move swifter toward legislative reform; but the Bank pressed on. 148 It is
therefore doubtful to what extent the Bank-supported project provided a locus of
coordination for donor efforts, contrary to what the completion report says. 149

9.7     Despite the possibility that donor coordination could have been stronger supervision
is rated satisfactory based on the strong effort made by the Bank during the latter part of
implementation.

Borrower Performance
Government

10.1 According to the completion report, there was continuity of high-level support for the
project, through three administrations. Government played a key role in the passage of
enabling legislation-the Fontierras Law (1999) and the Registry of Cadastre Information
Law (2005)-without which the project's institutional development objectives would not
have been achieved. It also had a hand in encouraging the General Property Registry to begin
a long-overdue review of its procedures, a pre-requisite for integration of cadastre and
registry functions. But government was unable to ensure that this integration was achieved
before the loan closed.

10.2 A consultant report presented to USAID in 2005 was less sanguine about the
government's overall role on land administration: "Since signing the Peace Accords [1996],
the political will to address land-related matters in a committed way has been consistently
lacking". The report argued that there was a split within government with respect to the
resolution of land conflicts. One group, influential within the Ministry of Agriculture,
concentrated on "promoting the rule of law to protect private property rights, and is not
supportive of efforts to address the historical root causes of land disputes". A second group,
centered on the Vice-President, "sees that the country must address the root causes of land
disputes in order to modernize and develop economically".150 .

10.3 Also, it has been alleged that, in September 2004, the Ministry of Agriculture
undermined the Fontierras land titling effort by dismissing, for political reasons, the Sub-
Director of Regularization and 40 of his staff, stripping the agency of some of its most
technically qualified professionals. 151

10.4 Congress was slow to approve the loan. The proj ect was approved by the Bank's
Board in December 1998 but was only signed in April 2000, becoming effective in July of
that year. The delay was partly attributable to the need to first shepherd through the
F ontierras Law (approved in May 1999), which provided necessary clarification of the legal
framework for land rights. Subsequent delays were harder to justify and were associated with
slowness in the release of counterpart funds and limited progress with rural land titling
(reflecting government's lack of leverage over Fontierras, an autonomous entity).
Government was also implicated in the substantial delay in passing the RIC Law, meaning
that from 2000 to 2005 the cadastral procedures developed by the project lacked legitimacy.
Finally, government failed to exert the pressure needed to bring the General Property
Registry and the National Geographic Institute into agreement on integration of registry and
cadastre. 152

10.5    Government performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Implementing agency

10.6 There were two implementing agencies (UTJ/RIC and Fontierras) and the rating is a
weighted average of their performance. UTJ (which operated from 2000 to 2005, and was
replaced by RIC) was competently led with few changes at the top during project
implementation. It had a well-trained staff that performed well, particularly in field
operations. By 2002 UTJ had developed the capacity to implement, on its own, land
regularization activities in urban areas. It therefore chose to use its own staff for these
activities rather than using foreign firms, an approach that saved money (freeing up the
resources for the project to extend to one municipality outside Peten) and helped build local
capacity. Sound partnerships were developed with the General Property Registry, the 12
municipalities of Peten, and with other donors working on land administration. UTJ played a
key role in ensuring that the cadastral surveying activities taking place in various regions of
the country (under the auspices of different donors) shared a minimum set of techniques and
standards. The communications campaigns used by UTJ to mobilize support for
regularization from (often leery) local populations were particularly effective. 153

10.7 Less positive was UTJ's delay in launching international bidding for rural land
regularization contracts. "Since this activity was critical for achievement of the rural
surveying and titling targets and the international contract represented roughly one-fifth of
the loan, its delay by about two years seriously handicapped the Project". This contributed
substantially to the project's failure to meet its rural land titling target. UTJ could also have
done more to push for baseline surveys to be conducted. 154

10.8 Project management costs were more than double the appraisal estimate (Table 1) for
reasons that emerged during lEG's review of the completion report. According to the Region,
it was not expected at appraisal that UTJ would develop the capacity to carry out, by itself,
land regularization in urban areas. Thus there was no expenditure category in the Loan
Agreement for investments costs arising from the field activities ofUTJ. These costs.were
charged to the category intended for UTJ administrative costs, greatly pushing up the total
expenditures allocated to project management. It is not clear what UTJ's actual
administrative costs were but in its response to lEG's query the Region said that the
expansion of the project's geographical coverage approved by the Bank in April 2005 was
possibly precisely because of savings generated by UTJ's urban cadastral work (which
obviated the need to hire foreign firms). 155 The transfer of implementation from a temporary
coordinating unit (UTJ) to a permanent agency (RIC) meant that the investment in staff
development and infrastructure was more likely to be sustained. The performance of
UTJ/RIC is rated satisfactory.

10.9 The performance of Fontierras, the agency with specific responsibility for rural land
titling, is rated unsatisfactory. It proved incapable of matching the brisk pace with which
cadastral surveying proceeded. This was possibly explained by its dual mandate (there was
much greater pressure for it to deliver on the land redistribution part of its brief than to title

rural lands). Equally important, Fontierras is an autonomous entity run by a Board over
which RIC or the Ministry of Agriculture (which chairs the Board) had limited suasion. 156

10.10 Aggregating the performance of the two entities, implementing agency performance
is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Summary
This report assesses the perfonnance of the US$77.2 million Land Fund Project. The
project was supported by an IBRD loan (No. 4432) ofUS$23.0 million, which was
approved on January 7, 1999. The loan became effective nearly two years later than
expected partly owing to a change of government and the project closed 30 months
behind schedule, fully disbursed.

The project was an innovative attempt to redistribute farmland in favor of poor farm
families and the landless. The project's specific objectives were to (a) facilitate access to
land to beneficiaries; (b) support beneficiaries to access technical assistance and
productive subproject financing; and (c) initiate improvements to the efficiency of land
markets in Guatemala. The project set up a land fund (Fontierras) which was designed to
help finance the purchase of land from willing sellers and to transfer it to beneficiaries
using a package of loan and grant financing. The project ran parallel with the Land
Administration Project, which was separately assessed by lEG.

The project components comprised: (a) Access to Land (planned cost, US$52.2 million;
actual cost, US$56.2 million), which provided credit to groups of low-income and
landless people to purchase land from private owners; and (to a lesser extent) covered the
cost ofland leases (none of this component was financed by the Bank); (b) Institutional
Strengthening (planned cost, US$2.0 million; actual cost, US$2.00 million), which
financed the equipment and operating costs of the project management unit; (c)
Community Strengthening (planned cost, US$13.3 million; actual cost, US$5.4 million),
which helped communities to establish themselves as legal entities, register land
ownership, organize, review the legal status of land offered for sale, prepare investment
proposals, obtain financing and contract technical assistance before and after land
purchase; and (d) Community Subprojects (planned cost, US$9.7 million; actual cost,
US$1.5 million), which financed complementary investments, including small-scale
water supply systems, access roads, community mills, and storage and marketing
facilities.

lEG rates Outcome as moderately unsatisfactory. Project objectives were highly relevant,
seeking as they did to serve the ends of equity and efficiency by redistributing underused
land. But there were several flaws in project design, including notably the failure to set a
limit per family on the size of the land purchase loan, reducing the incentive for
beneficiaries to bargain hard over the price. The project achieved its objectives to a
modest extent. Although double the expected number of beneficiary families was served,
there is no solid evidence to demonstrate that land productivity increased significantly or
that the land market operated more efficiently as a consequence of the land fund. Owing
partly to shortfalls in the provision for working capital and the lack of adequate technical
assistance for land fund beneficiaries the economic rate of return is probably lower than
expected.

The Risk to Development Outcome is rated significant. Owing to shortfalls in the
repayment ofloans obtained for land purchase, two-thirds of Fontierra's portfolio for
land purchase is at risk.
                                             92


Bank Performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. Although this was an innovative
project with worthwhile objectives, there were important design flaws which lowered
quality at entry. Supervision failed to rectify the design flaws and there was a significant
lack of candor in supervision and completion reporting. Borrower Performance is also
rated moderately unsatisfactory based on ineffectual support by government and erratic
leadership by the implementing agency.

The Lessons learned from this project are discussed in the Overview report which draws
on findings from IEG performance assessments of three Central American land policy
projects.

Background
 1.1    Land Reform. There has been no comprehensive redistribution of agricultural land in
Guatemala; but there is nevertheless a complex legal and institutional framework for agrarian
reform. A radical attempt at land reform in 1952 (Decreto 31) was aborted following
overthrow of the government of Jacobo Arbenz. Several laws were passed annulling the
Arbenz agrarian reform law, replacing it with other mechanisms for land re-distribution such
as a land tax and an idle land provision (Decreto 559). The Agrarian Transformation Law
(Decree 1551), which was passed in October 1962, established the National Institute of
Agrarian Transformation (INTA), an agency charged with distributing land to the landless
and land-poor, implementing a titling program, and establishing a land purchase program.
INTA's mandate was to extend the program of distributing state-owned land and continued
to do so until the supply of these lands was largely exhausted. The Land Fund (Fondo de
Tierras, known as Fontierras) was created after the 1996 Peace Accords, initially to provide a
land fund to provide properties to returning war refugees. Returning refugees were settled on
land already owned by the state-much of this land consisted of farms that were abandoned
by their owners and whose ownership was taken over by the state and administered by INTA.
When INTA was disbanded, Fontierras took over many of its activities, such as adjudicating
state-owned land and issuing definitive land titles. 157

 1.2    Before the market-assisted land reform option was introduced by the project, there
were three legal mechanisms of land redistribution: distribution of state-owned land (terrenos
baldfos) by state agencies such as INTA from the 1950s until the late 1990s, and by
Fontierras since 1999; taking of privately-owned idle lands (tierras ociosas) to be distributed
by INTA and Fontierras; and taxing underproductive land in order to move it into the land
market. The option of taking and distributing idle lands was, for the most part, not pursued.
Although INTA had legal jurisdiction to distribute idle land, INTA did not have the capacity
to identify these lands. Also, a land tax that motivates owners to put unproductive lands on
the market has not been put into practice either. 158

 1.3    Poverty Map. The rural areas of Guatemala house about fifty percent of the
population but account for roughly three-quarters of the poor. The agricultural sector
represents 22 percent of GDP, compared to around 10 percent in Costa Rica and EI Salvador
and 14 percent in Honduras. 159 The concentration of poverty in rural areas has been attributed
partly to the increasingly skewed distribution of agricultural land: the Gini coefficient for
land ownership was 0.82 in 1964 and is around 0.85 today (the same level as in 1979).
Between the agricultural census of 1964 and 1979, farms under 2 manzanas (1. 5 hectares)
made up about 44 percent of farms. By 1979, farms of that size had increased to 60% of
farms; but the average size of farms in this category had decreased from 0.7 to 0.5 hectare.
On the other hand, owners of farms 450 hectares or larger had increased the total area they
controlled by 10 percent. Land concentration tends to be 'highest in areas with the most fertile
land: the departments of Esquintla, Suchitepequez, Retalhuleu, and Izabal. Small properties
are located mainly in the western highland departments of San Marcos, Quiche, Totonicapan,

Solohi, Huehuetenango and Quetzaltenango. These departments also have the highest
indigenous population density as well as the highest levels of poverty and social
marginalization in Guatemala. 160                             .


Project Overview
Objectives

2.1    According to the appraisal document (and consistent with the statement in the Loan
Agreement), the project's specific objectives were "to (a) facilitate access to land to
beneficiaries; (b) support beneficiaries to access technical assistance and productive
subproject financing; and (c) initiate improvements to the efficiency of land markets in
Guatemala". 161

Components

2.2     According to the Country Assistance Strategy, under the project, the Bank would
support "complementary investments for sustainable improvements in land productivity (but
not land purchase) for over 10,000 families"; the government would finance the land
purchase part of the package through the newly-established Land Fund. 162

2.3      The access to land component-none of the financing of which was provided by the
Bank-accounted for 70 percent of actual project cost (Table 1). This component provided
credit to groups of low-income and landless people to purchase land from private owners;
and (to a lesser extent) covered the cost ofland leases.

2.4     The institutional strengthening component financed the equipment and operating
costs of the project management unit. The community strengthening component helped
communities to establish themselves as legal entities, register land ownership, organize,
review the legal status of land offered for sale, prepare investment proposals, obtain
financing and contract technical assistance before and after land purchase. The technical
assistance following land purchase was provided as a three-year grant, and was intended to
cover 100 percent of costs in the first year, 65 percent in the second year and 30 percent in
the third year. Finally, the community subprojects component financed complementary
investments, including small-scale water supply systems, access roads, community mills, and
storage and marketing facilities. Subproject selection was based on a negative list of
ineligible subprojects. Beneficiary communities were expected to contribute to the total costs
of each investment.

2.5    The project was intended to be the first of three phases in a ten year program for
which the government requested adaptable program loan financing.

Institutional Framework

2.6     In May 1997, the Fontierras trust fund was created under the auspices of the Ministry
of Agriculture, providing for the first time a market-assisted option for land redistribution.
The Fontierras Law was passed in May 1999, establishing Fontierras as an autonomous legal
entity, with its own management and specialized staff and five regional offices. In addition to
its responsibility for market-assisted land reform, Fontierras inherited the land regularization
responsibilities ofINTA, which was liquidated. Oversight of Fontierras was provided by a
Board of Directors (Consejo Directivo) whose seven members represented the Ministry of
Agriculture (chair), Ministry of Finance, the commercial farming lobby (CONADEA and
Camara del Agro), and indigenous, peasant and cooperative organizations. The Board
selected the General Manager of Fontierras. An additional governance mechanism was
introduced in 2002: the Control and Verification Commission, which reported to the Board
and was intended to provide greater transparency and tighter screening for procedural
irregularities. The project coordinating unit was located in the External Cooperation
Department of Fontierras.

Implementation

2.7    The Bank's Board approved the Project in January 1999. The 1999 national elections
in Guatemala resulted in delays and Congress only approved the loan in April 2000. The loan
was made effective in July 2000, a year later than expected. It closed 30 months behind
schedule in June 2005. No safeguard or fiduciary failings were reported by the Bank during
supervision.

2.8    During project implementation, the Minister of Agriculture was replaced six times,
leading to various policy reversals that negatively affected implementation. By 2002-2003
government commitment to the land reform agenda presented in 1998 had substantially
eroded. After the change of administration in 2004, the earlier decision to proceed with a
second phase of the Land Fund adaptable program loan was reversed.

2.9     Project execution was also hindered by two external shocks. First, there was an
international coffee crisis throughout the implementation period, reducing the capacity of
coffee farmers to repay the land purchase credits received from Fontierras. Second, in 2004,
a serious drought in the southwest municipality of Champerico affected farm production and
was another factor tending to prevent farmers from repaying their loans.

Relevance
Relevance of Objectives

3.1      This was one of an innovative series of Bank projects developed around the mid-
1990s that sought to make redistributive land reform a realistic option for Bank financing.
The case for supporting land reform was made in a 1975 Bank policy paper but, owing
largely to an adverse international political environment, this did not result in projects. In the
1990s, supported by new analytic work, the Bank placed land reform back on the negotiating
table, developing proposals for a market-assisted model which was subsequently tested in
Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala, Malawi, South Africa, and Thailand. 163 For most of its
existence the Bank did not permit its funds to be used to purchase land in most types of
development projects; but its operating guidelines were revised in 2004 to make this
     'bl
POSSI e. 164


3.2     Each of the specific objectives was highly relevant. First, there was a clear need to
improve access to land by poorer groups, on political, moral and economic grounds. Various
persons interviewed by lEG described the provision of land as a safety valve-a means to
reduce the scope for the civil strife and disruption likely to arise from the failure to respond
to land hunger. It was an essential part of the peace accords process of the late 1990s. One
interviewee said that giving poor people land was an issue of basic human dignity and a way
to enhance the self-worth of the poor. An evaluation found that Fontierras has "contributed
substantially to maintaining social peace". 165

3.3      The economic case for increasing the poor's access to land was made in a 1995
poverty assessment, which argued that a more equitable distribution of land would employ
more labor and increase efficiency.166 It stated that empirical evidence strongly suggested
that: (a) small farms have higher yields and higher total factor productivity than large farms;
and (b) small farms use more labor and less capital per hectare cultivated than large farms. 167
The project was an integral part of the Bank's support for the broader process of bringing
peace to Guatemala after 36 years of insurgency and was fully in line with the Country
Assistance Strategy (Table 2).168

3.4     Technical assistance and complementary investments were supported by the project
in order to boost the productivity gains from land redistribution. Experience worldwide has
shown that giving the poor land is not enough to ensure growth in their incomes and
productivity: they need training in order to fully exploit the land and they need working
capital; and the structure of financing needs to reward the most profitable and sustainable
subproject proposals.

3.5     The case for the third objective-increasing the efficiency of land markets--emerges
from studies showing a high level of segmentation in land markets: the poor buy from the
poor and the rich buy from the rich; only in a few cases are poor families able to buy parts of
large estates, or are able to group together to buy the whole estate. 169 Efficiency is also
constrained by the lack of information about ownership and parcel characteristics (a problem

addressed by the parallel, Bank-supported land administration project). "Verifying ownership
information in the property registry is time-consuming and costly. It requires the services of a
lawyer who travels to one of the two registry locations. Inaccuracies in the registry often
have to be resolved before a transfer can be completed, thus adding to the costs".170

3.6        Based on these considerations the relevance of project objectives is rated high.

Relevance of Design

3.7     The Fontierras market-assisted land reform process works as follows. Applicants for
Fontierras land purchase credits are officially limited to: men and women without land,
peasant men and women with insufficient land (less than 1 hectare), and peasant men and
women with an income of less than four minimum rural salaries. 171 According to the rules,
groups of would-be beneficiaries approach Fontierras once they have identified a farm they
want to buy. The group may have already started negotiating a price with the owner of the
farm. Fontierras commissions an independent assessment of the farm, as well as a technical
assessment of its productive capacity. Using these assessments as a benchmark, the seller and
the group of buyers negotiate a price, with the technical assistance of Fontierras-and also
possibly of an NGO. If buyer and seller agree on a price, Fontierras extends the buyers a
loan, using the land as collateral. Purchase of the land by Fontierras is contingent on
presentation of a viable productive project by the would-be beneficiaries. If approval is
given, the farm is turned over as a whole unit to the beneficiaries and, until the loan is paid
off, only a collective legal title (Patrimonio Agrario Colectivo) is available to the group.
However, beneficiaries decide among themselves whether to farm the land collectively or
individually. Once the loan is paid off, the group can opt for the land to be officially
subdivided into family parcels, each with a fully transferable title. In

3.8      Under the terms of the Bank-supported project, the government had sole
responsibility for financing the land purchase credits while the Bank limited itself to funding
the complementary investments (in line with the then prevailing restrictions on the Bank's
ability to finance land purchases). Complementary financing was provided as a grant equal to
26 times the official monthly minimum wage for farm laborers. Beneficiaries themselves
decided how to allocate the grant between three categories of expenditure: food to cover
immediate subsistence needs; working capital; and repayment of the credit for land purchase.

3.9     There are several positive features to consider. First, project design was based on
experience from similar projects. "The program built upon lessons learned from a small-scale
program supported with USAID assistance, which financed a total of 30 farms for
beneficiaries in 1998 and 1999".173 There was also cross-fertilization with the market-
assisted land reform project in Brazil, including a study tour for Guatemalan counterparts.
Second, the design was responsive to stakeholder needs. During preparation there were
various consultations with indigenous communities and their leaders. The Board of Directors
of Fontierras included representatives from peasant, indigenous and cooperative

organizations, as well as the private sector. Third, a land administration project was designed
in parallel (by the same task manager) and approved by the Bank's Board almost
simultaneously. By building up the institutions for regularizing land rights this parallel
operation was an important complement to the Fontierras project. Fourth, the Bank loan was
modest in size, which was appropriate given the innovative nature of the project.

3.10 On the other hand, there are four respects in which project design could have been
stronger. First, there were difficulties associated with setting a ceiling to the loan amount that
each beneficiary family could receive for the purpose of buying land. Although the initial
project design allowed for such a ceiling, this was dropped when the Fontierras law was
passed, on the grounds that regional variations in land prices made it impractical to legislate
for a panterritorial ceiling: instead, the price of land per hectare was used as the benchmark
for deciding whether applications would proceed. This presupposed that there was a rigorous
and transparent approach to setting the threshold price; and close monitoring of price trends
up and down the country.

3.11 Thus, Article 11 of the F ontierras law (which was under discussion at the same time
the Bank was preparing the project) set no limit per family on the size of the land purchase
loan. The lack of a ceiling made it less likely that beneficiaries would look hard for cheaper
properties, or bargain hard over the price. The project design was based on the assumption
that obliging beneficiaries to take on a substantial debt to buy land would dissuade all but the
most committed applicants for Fontierras financing. 174 Loans would only be granted to
applicants with viable productive projects, projects that would generate enough revenue for
the loan to be paid back. However, as it turned out, the size of the loan could well exceed the
scope of the productive project to amortize it. There was little to stop families assuming debts
that exceeded their capacity to pay (Figure 2 below shows the consequences for the
Fontierras portfolio). Moreover, according to some lEG interviewees, beneficiaries were
advised, covertly or overtly, not to pay back the loans they received. Some peasant and
indigenous organizations publicly proclaimed that the poor should not be expected to pay for
land. The resulting efficiency losses could have been contained if there had been a ceiling per
family on the amount paid for land. Since the Bank did not finance the land purchase
component it had little leverage over this matter.

3.12 In Guatemala the practice of impartial property valuation was not fully developed and
there was a shortage of appropriately trained independent surveyors. According to several
persons interviewed by lEG, to various press reports (Appendix D, Table D2), and to a
CEPAL studyl75, properties were frequently overpriced, with the surplus proceeds being
pocketed by landlords, leaders of peasant and indigenous organizations, Fontierras staff,
surveyors and the beneficiaries themselves. Once more, the scope for corruption would have
been less if a per-family ceiling on land purchase had been implemented.

3.13 There was a second design limitation, concerning the selection of beneficiaries.
Before the project was appraised there was a long list of Clients (sponsored by the various
parties to the peace process) who needed to be accommodated, rendering formal selection

procedures moot. During the first half of implementation, not all of the would-be
beneficiaries were vetted; and the eligibjlity assessment questionnaire was applied in
Fontierras offices, rather than where the applicants lived (making it impossible to verify asset
levels). This proved to be a significant oversight because most of the property purchased
under the project was transferred in the first three years of implementation (2000-2002)-that
is, in the period when vetting was weakest-increasing the likelihood that beneficiaries          .
would not perform well.

3.14 Third, project design paid insufficient attention to the quality and availability of the
technical assistance on which the performance of beneficiaries depended. While it would not
have been feasible or appropriate for the project to attempt to plug the gap left by the absence
of a public extension service, more attention could have been given to establishing a roster of
proven private-sector professionals from which beneficiaries could select; coupled with
separate training programs for service providers and beneficiaries.

3.15 Fourth, the appraisal report provided no details on the design for M&E and its
institutional arrangements. Given that this was the first phase of a ten-year adaptable program
loan, the absence of a carefully-designed M&E component is a serious weakness.

3.16    Based on these considerations, the relevance of project design is rated modest.

Overall Rating

3.17    The overall rating of the project's relevance is substantial.

Efficacy
4.1    This section takes the three specific objectives of the project and asks to what extent
each was achieved.

Objective 1: "Facilitate access to land to beneficiaries"

4.2     Achievement of this objective is rated substantial. During project preparation, a large
pool of potential beneficiaries built up. "By mid-1998 around 240 groups have requested
assistance for the purchase of land. These groups represent a population of approximately
24,000 families: eight communities comprising 8,200 families, and around 230 groups
comprising 15,800 families".176 In relation to this universe, the appraisal target was modest.
The aim was to reach 7,425 families during the project (that is, during the first three years of
what was envisaged as a ten-year program of Bank support). 177 The actual number of
beneficiaries served was double the target (15,487 families); although the implementation
period turned out to be five, not three, years. 178 For reasons set out above (Paragraph 3.12) the
socioeconomic profile of beneficiaries was not adequately monitored so it is not possible to
say what proportion were poor. A separate target was set for the number of properties to be

 purchased during the project (100); the actual number was 186. No appraisal target was set
 for the number of indigenous and female-headed households to be covered; the actual
 proportion of these was respectively 30 percent and 11 percent. 179 A survey of beneficiaries
 found that 88 percent of those interviewed deemed the selection process to have been gender
 equitabie. 180 The performance indicators bearing on this objective also included the time taken
 to process land claims, although no target was specified. According to the ICR, the average
 time elapsed from acceptance of an application to effective disbursement was 18 months, 18 I
 which was still the case in December 2009 when lEG conducted the assessment mission.
 According to another source, over the period 2004-2006, 56 percent of surveyed beneficiaries
 reported that their application was processed in not more than 24 months (16 percent said it
 took over 4 years). 182

. Objective 2: "Support beneficiaries to access technical assistance and productive
  subproject financing"

 4.3     Phrased in these precise terms, the objective is an output ('support to ... "), rather than
 an outcome ("increased productivity"). As noted above, this expected output was exceeded:
 double the target number of families was served. But it is legitimate for this evaluation to ask
 whether the underlying outcome was realized. To what extent did the technical assistance and
 subproject financing provided by the project result in increased agricultural productivity?
 This was arguably an explicit intention of the project because "change in land productivity in
 parcels of beneficiaries during the 3-year period" was included as a performance indicator. 183
 Admittedly, it is perhaps umeasonable to expect productivity to be turned around in such a
 short period. But the trend of change-based partly on doubts about the extent and quality of
 technical assistance (see paragraph 7.1 below)-suggests that progress toward the ultimate
 objective of enhanced productivity should be rated modest.

4.4      The project financed 240 subprojects, of which 161 supported productive activities
and 79 supported social infrastructure. The productive subprojects included livestock
production (59), planting of cash crops, such as coffee, cardamom and pineapple (30), farm
mechanization (20), reforestation (14), irrigation (13), commercialization (16), and storage
facilities (6). This breakdown indicates a substantial deviation from the subproject focus that
was envisaged at appraisal. The appraisal document states that subprojects were intended to
be "complementary infrastructure investments". 184 The completion report does not
acknowledge this slippage: it states that project components were not revised but elsewhere
refers to "intra-predial" and "extra-predial" productive investments, that clearly extend
beyond infrastructure. 185 With respect to "farm-level productive investments" the appraisal
document makes it clear that "Long-term financing for farm investments other than common

infrastructure should be Brovided by other development programs or financial intermediaries
at market interest rates". 86 In other words, Bank funds were used to fund a wider range of
investments than initially envisaged.

4.5         The project also provided grants to finance technical assistance for three years after
land was transferred to the beneficiaries, with the grant covering 100 percent of costs in the
first year, 65 percent in the second year and 30 percent in the third year. Fontierras staff
reported that, in practice, none of the costs have actually been recovered; technical assistance
remains a free good and a recent survey found that most beneficiaries were not willing to pay
for it. ls7

4.6      The completion report found that "average land productivity has not changed
significantly during these initial years of implementation, largely due to (i) the need for
newly-established families to attend to basic needs such as housing, water supply, and
schools, all of which delayed families from initiating productive activities; (ii) the fact that
many farms had been abandoned prior to purchase under the Land Fund, which implied the
need for significant time and financial resources to restore land productivity; and (iii) the
technical assistance aimed at increasing agricultural productivity was somewhat weak and
plagued with delays". ISS

4.7     This finding from the completion report needs to be treated carefully. It was based on
a survey carried out in 2004. The project began implementation in 2001 and, given the
slowness of the settlement process, most beneficiaries would not have taken possession of
their land until 2002 or later; it was likely some time after that before significant productivity
gains could be realized with respect to the "without project" comparator. It is unfair to draw
definitive conclusions about the productivity impact of the whole project based on a survey
conducted so soon after the beneficiaries were installed.

4.8    But a separate survey found that the crop yield of the Fontierras farms was 21 percent
lower than that of neighboring properties, based on comparing survey findings on Fontierras
farms with agricultural census data on average yields of farms in the same municipality. 189
The farms in the sample that were operated collectively were 43 percent less productive than
the municipal average while farms that had been divided into family holdings were 17
percent less productive. (The collectively-operated farms accounted for 30 percent of the
sample). Yields may have been lower because the lands in question had been abandoned or
neglected before redistribution, making the comparison with neighboring (fully operational)
farms an unfair one. Also, this was obviously a rough-and-ready comparison because it was
not possible to control for land quality.

4.9     The relative difference in revenue generation between Land Fund lands and other
lands is also hinted at by data comparing income changes for beneficiaries and non-

189. Miethbauer (2005), pp. 38-40. The evaluation was based on a stratified random sample of71 of the 164
farms bought between January 1998 and August 2003. The reference period for the survey was March 2003 to
February 2004.
                                                     103


beneficiaries. Of 50 beneficiary households surveyed, 74 percent reported that income was
higher at the time of the survey than it was before land was transferred. Among non-
beneficiary households in the same locality, 54 percent reported an income increase over a
comparable period.!90 Another source assessed beneficiary perceptions of the change in
household income, comparing the period before transfer with the present. The results suggest
that income rose between the two periods for most beneficiary households: of the sample as a
whole, 75 percent reported an increase; among the subset of extremely poor households 70
percent said that income rose.!9! This second set of data shed less light on project impact
because there is no indication of how much income changed for a matched group of non-
beneficiaries. Also, it is not clear how much non-farm changes drove the income increase.

4.10 In summary, although the project undoubtedly led to some increase in land
productivity overall (given that much of the land transferred was not being exploited
previously) it is not clear by how much. In any case, changes in land productivity need to be
set against the prices paid by farmers for this land to assess the net impact on farmers'
incomes; reports of inflated prices paid for land (see paragraph 3.11) point to at best a modest
impact on farmers' net incomes."

Objective (3): "Initiate improvements to the efficiency of land markets in Guatemala"

4.11 Achievement of this objective is rated negligible because through a combination of
faulty project design and misallocation of project funds the efficient working of the land
market was compromised. The project operated within the following conceptual framework.
When land markets operate efficiently land will gravitate from lower productivity to higher
productivity use. From an efficiency standpoint there is no difference whether the transfer
occurs through sales or through rental markets. Governments do well to remember that
"rental markets may contribute more to efficiency than sales markets".!92 Imperfections in
land markets arise: from incomplete knowledge about the physical characteristics of, and
claims to, land; from incomplete credit markets (e.g. difficulty of borrowing to buy land or
finance working capital); from the costs involved in selling land (e.g. notary and surveyor
fees); and from various distortions generated outside the land market (e.g. inflation, lower
tax on rural land compared to other assets) which tend to influence the price ofland, possibly
pushing the price out of ali~nment with the present value of profits derived from putting land
to its most productive use.! 3          .


4.12 In the case of Guatemala, at the time this project was prepared, making land markets
more efficient presupposed: strengthening the institutions of registry and cadastre; removing
the distortions which encouraged less efficient landholders to hang onto land; facilitating
access to land by poorer persons able to use the land more productively than those selling it
or leasing it-but without the means to fully pay the market price; and protecting landholders
from extra-economic coercion (e.g. physical intimidation or expropriation without
compensation).

4.13 Strengthening registry and cadastre institutions was tackled by a parallel project
(assessed separately by lEG). Progress was made but the expected integration of the separate
databases for cadastre and registry remains incomplete, adding to the cost of land
transactions. The project launched a series of actions to free up the supply of and demand for
land, aiming partly to redress market segmentation (see paragraph 3.5 above). From the
supply side, the introduction of a negotiated process of land reform was intended to
encourage the owners of large, underexploited estates, to sell up, secure in the knowledge
that they would obtain a fair price. According to knowledgeable stakeholders the tardiness of
the Fontierras process (see paragraph 4.2 above) led a number oflandowners to withdraw
offers they had made. The number of properties offered to Fontierras peaked around 2001,
partly driven by the collapse of the world coffee price; as coffee prices recovered and as
prospects for other crops (particularly sugar cane and oil palm) became more attractive, the
available supply of land diminished. The absence of a tax on rural properties reduced the
incentive for owners to sell underexploited land. All in all, the supply of land available for
negotiated land reform was well under the demand for it. In these circumstances, providing a
mixture of concessional credits and subsidies to help finance the purchase of land was liable
to drive up the price beyond a level equal to the present value of farm profits, contrary to the
efficiency objective of the project. Added to this there was lax oversight of the property
valuation process leading to various press reports (endorsed by Fontierras) 194 that properties
had exchanged hands for amounts well above their productive value (see paragraph 3.11
above). There were various reports of small farmers who had been forced, through a
combination of physical threats and "encirclement" (involving denial of access to farm-to-
market roads) to abandon their land. Thus, land market efficiency was not enhanced through
Fontierras-mediated sales.

4.14 What of the Fontierras initiative on rentals? This initiative was contemplated by the
Bank-supported project but was initially a minor sideline; today it is the primary focus of
Fontierras, reflecting the government's decision not to seek Bank support for the second
phase of the market-assisted process that was initially envisaged. There were mixed reports
about the e켌ectiveness of this initiative. One view is that the program was sound because it
encouraged the land poor to acquire farming skills at low risk (without assuming heavy debt),
a first step toward eventual purchase of land. The discipline obtained in paying off the small
debts incurred from rental would stand these farmers in good stead when the time came to
take out larger loans. On the other hand, these small debts are not actually being collected.
Another view argues that while the rental program helped to improve the food security of the
tenants, because the land was primarily used for staple crops it was not necessarily being
employed as productively as it might be.

4.15 Foritierras made a modest contribution to improving land market information, setting
up a database on land purchases that is open to public. According to the ICR, the project
supported "development of a website with information on land price and location of land". 195
But it also says: "The establishment of a land market information system proved particularly

difficult and would require a well-established line agency with strong financial backing". 196
Although the Fontierras website continues to operate, at present there is no active link to a
land market data base.

Overall Rating

4.16     The overall rating of the project's efficacy is rated modest.

Efficiency
5.1     At appraisal the economic rate of return was estimated at 23 percent based upon the
projected increases in land productivity and farm revenues in the newly acquired farms
purchased through Fontierras credits and supported by Bank-financed technical assistance
and productive investments. Rates of return ranged from 7 percent in coastal and southern
regions of Guatemala to 32percent in the lowland areas of northern Guatemala. At the mid-
term review, based on a representative survey of farms, it was concluded that "in most cases,
the level of productivity had not increased to the levels estimated at appraisal" owing to
"delays in getting farms under production, the relatively high cost of land, the lack of
working funds for production, and a decline in commodity prices (e.g., coffee)". 197 The
economic rate of return was not re-estimated for the completion report.

5.2      The analysis of efficiency is necessarily incomplete because while there are a
complete setof data on Fontierras expenditures per farm there are no recent survey data on
farm production making it impossible to assess net benefits. Despite the multiple reports
about the inflated prices paid for properties bought by Fontierras the average price of land
purchased was Q7,31O (c.US$950) per hectare, comparable to the appraisal estimate. Total
project costs were as expected, but twice the number of households benefited, and 75 percent
of survey respondents in two separate surveys said their income went up. Much of the land
redistributed was not being used previously. These are the positive factors with respect to the
rate of return actuaqy achieved.

5.3      However, there is some evidence that the there was less scope for raising productivity
than expected: only 40 percent of the grant provided to each family was used as working
capital, compared to the 50 percent expected (55 percent was used to amortize the loan and 5
percent to purchase food (to tide over families waiting the first harvest). This, together with
the various reports about the failings of technical assistance, may have depressed the
economic rate of return; but it is not clear by how much. .

5.4     There is some evidence that the proposals for productive projects-the quality of
which was supposed to determine whether the land purchase credit was granted-were only
cursorily reviewed. The proposal did not give detailed consideration to the productive
potential of the land being offered for sale and the infrastructure and marketing constraints

that would confront any farm enterprise. It did not specify the expected cash flow and the
extent to which this was likely to be sufficient to pay off the' land purchase debt. 198

5.5       Efficiency is rated modest.

Outcome
6.1   Based on substantial relevance, modest efficacy and modest efficiency, project
outcome is rated moderately unsatisfactory.


Risk to Development Outcome
7.1     There are two concerns. First, it is not clear that F ontierras will survive as an agency
capable of financing itself. Second, the lack of long-term provision for agricultural extension
raises doubts about the viability of the farm enterprises that were established. The financing
package included three years of technical assistance, administered by an (overstretched) team
within Fontierras. The absence of a nationwide system of extension (outside the project)
reduced the scope for productivity improvements. Staff members of non-government
organizations were candid about the poor quality of the technical assistance available from
non-government sources.

7.2     Given the sharp fall in the number of farms purchased by Fontierras the agency
overhead accounts for a rising proportion of the financing for each farm that is created
(Figure 1). The other concern is the large proportion of beneficiaries with loan payments due
who are either not paying at all or are behind with payments (Figure 2). Almost two-thirds of
Fontierra's portfolio for land purchase is at risk. At the time of the IEG mission it was
unclear whether the government would approve a new financing package for Fontierras now
that the ten years originally budgeted for has expired.

7.3      Risk to development outcome is rated significant.

Monitoring and Evaluation

Design

8.1     The appraisal document included no details on the design ofM&E, nor any indication
of the institutional arrangements. Performance indicators were sketchy and targets (e.g., for
participation by women and indigenous peoples) were not always specified. No provision
was made for a baseline survey. The Project Coordinating Unit recruited M&E specialists
and the staff of the Unit received M&E training. 199 In addition to the usual arrangements for
setting up a management information system, M&E features included a survey designed to
inform selection of applicants for land purchase credits. The survey collected information on
the socioeconomic profile of applicants (incompletely-see paragraph 3.12 above) and the
current land use of the property they were seeking to buy.

Implementation and Use

8.2     Project processes were satisfactorily monitored and the financial management system
performed adequately. M&E data were fruitfully deployed in the mid-term review and also
informed preparation of the completion report. For most of the implementation period the
survey used to filter applicants for land purchase credits was only administered to those
members of the farmer group presenting themselves at the Fontierras office; no attempt was
made to visit the place where the group was living (which would have been important to help
verify assets), or to follow-up with all members of the group (see paragraph above). Also,
lEG was not able to obtain any information from the surveys of those whose applications for
credit had been turned down. The failure to preserve this information made it hard to assess
the rigor and톞he transparency of the selection process; and removed information that could
have been used to construct a control group for subsequent impact evaluation. Towards the
end of project implementation a consultant was hired to make an independent assessment of
beneficiary living conditions; but in the absence of any baseline survey this report does not
provide a solid basis for drawing conclusions about project impact. 2oo

8.3     There is an additional consideration. The standard for monitoring and evaluating the
first phase of an adaptable program loan should be set higher than for a one-time project,
because of the learning insights that the first phase is supposed to generate. The quality of
monitoring and evaluation is rated modest.

Bank Performance
Quality at Entry

9.1     The completion report notes that "there was no initial QAG review of quality at entry,
but the fifth Quality of Supervision Assessment evaluated quality at ~ntry as Satisfactory
with respect to the realism and quality of objectives and the agreement between components

 and objectives".201 The Bank played a key advisory role in the land policy initiatives that
 flowed from the 1996 Peace Accords and had a close working relationship with
.government. 202 The land fund project was suitably complemented by a parallel Bank-
 supported project to develop the registry and cadastre that was approved almost
 simultaneously. The support for a long-term commitment based on a ten-year adaptable
 program loan made sense given the level and complexity of the institutional development
 called for. This was a risky project mainly because there was no way to be sure in advance
 that the supply of land to the market would be enough to cover demand. (The level of risk
 was underplayed in the appraisal document.) However, given the inequities in land
 distribution, the risks were worth taking. The Bank's approach was innovative and, ifthe
 project succeeded, there would likely have been a high payoff through replication in other
 countries. There were, however, a number of design weaknesses (see paragraphs above) and,
 given the need for thorough evaluation to build a case for market-assisted land reform, the
 absence of any provision for baseline and follow-up surveys was a major oversight. On the
 other hand, preparation fully addressed environmental concerns and there was careful
 screening to ensure that land transfers did not involve protected areas or natural savannahs. 203

9.2    The relevance of project design was rated modest (paragraph 3.14 above) and
consistent with that rating quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory.

Supervision

9.3    Two QAG reviews rated supervision satisfactory. There were two task managers in
the course of implementation and supervision missions were staged regularly every six
months. The Bank organized study tours to Brazil and Honduras to inform project and
Fontierras staff about the design and performance of similar projects.

9.4     During supervision the Bank had limited leverage over the operation of Fontierras.
The completion report said that, "the Bank provided external and internal (i.e., Bank staff)
experts to assist the Board [ofFontierras] in defining policy changes that would address
perverse incentives in the processing ofland access credits ... One of the key changes was the
establishment of a ceiling for overall financial assistance per family,,.204 But lEG was unable
to obtain from Fontierras any documentary evidence of this putative change in lending
procedures; and a close review of the financing packages provided per family failed to show
any trend for the land purchase component to diminish over time, either in absolute terms or
relative to the farm development and other elements of the package. lEG sought but was
unable to obtain confirmation from Fontierras of the following statement in the completion

202. "Support for Peace Initiatives. The Bank is actively supporting the peace process in close interaction
with the UN. This has involved providing technical advice to the mediation team on financing issues and
technical and institutional issues associated with selected peace accords (indigenous, socioeconomic and
agrarian topics). Implementation of these accords wiII provide enhanced access by the poor and indigenous
communities to land, productive assets and basic social services. The Bank is also doing some preparatory work
to mobilize donor support for eventual implementation of a Peace Plan, beginning by convening an Informal
Donors Meeting in Paris in June 1995" (World Bank, 1995b, p. 9).

report: "The Bank's mid-term review, implemented as an in-depth and virtual "reappraisal" of
the project, led to the formulation of fundamental recommendations for policy changes that
were discussed with the Fontierras Board; these reforms were eventually adopted by
Fontierra".205 .

9.5     Also, the supervision reporting process did not refer to the various incidents of
corruption involving Fontierras, knowledge of which was widespread in Guatemala. For
example, in the final phase of implementation, investigations began that ultimately
culminated in a Fontierras internal audit finding that ex-functionaries were involved in
irregularities in processing contracts to design productive projects for two of the properties
purchased. 206 Also, there is no evidence that the supervision effort detected and highlighted
the poor quality and inadequacy of the technical assistance provided, and the risks to
sustainability due to non-repayment of loans.

9.6     Supervision performance is therefore rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Overall Rating

9.7     Following lEG-OpeS convention, the outcome ratings determines whether the two
sub-ratings of Bank perform~ce are averaged up or down. Given that in this case outcome
was rated in the unsatisfactory range the overall rating for Bank performance is rated
moderately unsatisfactory.

Borrower Performance
Government

10.1 Government was strongly committed to the project during the preparation process,
considering that improving the poor's access to land was a vital part of the Peace Accords
mandate. This commitment was reflected in the Borrower's agreement to bear 70 percent of
the project cost; a necessity given that the Bank was not permitted at that time to finance the
land purchase component of the project. The institutional framework that government set up
(with PROTIERRA as the apex agency) was sound. However, there was an eighteen-month
lag between approval of the project by the Bank's Board and loan effectiveness which may
have been linked to a falling-off in commitment (although delays occasioned by the election
cycle were also to blame).

10.2 Fontierras was run by a Board representing the full spectrum of interests, from
commercial farmers to peasant and indigenous organizations. On the one hand, the
governance arrangements have been criticized because the Board was not sufficiently
independent: some have argued that because it was chaired by the Ministry of Agriculture it
was too beholden to the commercial farm lobby.207 On the other hand, it could be argued
that government was too "hands off' in relation to the Fontierras Board, failing to intervene
expeditiously when the reports about corrupt dealings involving staff and Board

representatives first surfaced (see Appendix D, Table D2). There was a serious loss of
leadership continuity: the Ministry of Agriculture changed six times during project
implementation.

10.3 The government did little to support policies and operations complementary to the
land purchase program. For example, the need to strengthen the framework for agricultural
research and extension was not addressed. Also, the completion report notes that the
government could have introduced "transparent policies on land expropriation-with fair
compensation" in order to increase the supply of land on the market. In the absence of these
accompanying policy interventions, the Project had to confront a situation of excess demand
on its services, increased political intervention, and continuous upward pressure on the price
ofland purchased through Fontierras,,.208

10.4 According to the 2005 Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report there was a
"lack of government commitment during 2000-2003 to aspects of the reform agenda laid out
in 1998." The waning of government commitment to the Fontierras land purchase program
was partly associated with the change of administration in 2004 and was underscored by the
government's decision not to proceed with the second phase of the program it had originally
signed up to?09 The government was slow to address the issue of Fontierra's long-term
financial needs and failed to provide leadership on the matter of cleaning up the Fontierras
portfolio.

10.5    Government performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Implementing Agency

10.6 The completion report notes that the project coordinating unit in Fontierras
discharged its responsibilities satisfactorily. "The fact that the project exceeded its original
targets with respect to beneficiaries and investments in productive subprojects may be
attributed to the effectiveness of the PCU,,?lO Financial management was generally
satisfactory. But lEG came across allegations from various sources about corrupt dealings
involving Fontierras staff, including one General Manager who resigned in 2005 (see
Appendix D, Table D2). Although the ICR says that there was leadership continuity, by the
time ofIEG's visit Fontierras had had 12 General Managers in the previous ten years. There
were apparently frequent tensions between the GM and the Fontierras Board.

10.7    The performance of the implementing agency is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Overall Rating

10.8    Overall, Borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.
