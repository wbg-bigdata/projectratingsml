MMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIIDENT OF
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ARAB REPUBEBC OF EGYPT
FOR THIE MATRUH RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.       I submit for your approval the following memorandum and reccmmendation on
a proposed development credit to the Arab Republic of Egypt for SDR 15.9 million
(US$22.0 million equivalent) to help finance the Matruh Resourae Management
Project. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 35
years.
2.       Sector Background and Strategy. Historically, the Egyptian economy has
depended heavily on the agricultural sector. It was traditionally the main source
of employment and an important source of government revenues and foreign exchange.
However, the rapid growth of the rest of the economy after 1973, particularly oil
production, has had a marked impact on the role of agriculture. Even though
agriculture's share has fallen to 20 percent of GDP and 20 percent of commodity
exports during the 1990s, the sector still plays an important role in the Egyptian
economy. The agricultural p-oblems and issues in Egypt are dominated by the
critical need to manage scarce land and water resources more effectively, in order
to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population. The Nile is the country's
basic life-sustaining water resource, providing more than 95 percent of Egyptts
water requirements. Over 90 percent of the agricultural lands, which support a
population of 52 million people, are irrigated by the Nile. There is,
unfortunately, only limited scope for expanding these Nile irrigated lands.
Meanwhile, the average farm size in the Delta and the Nile Valley continues to
shrink.
3.       Notwithstanding government efforts, poverty, unemployment and social
hardship have not yet been eliminated in Egypt: approximately 20-25 percent of the
population still lives below the poverty line (LE 590 per capita per annum in 1992
prices). Small farmers, with little or no land, and women ard children feature
disproportionately among the poor and are among the most vulnerable segment of
society. To combat poverty and better manage the natural resource base, the
Government of Egypt (GOB) is attaching importance to the development of rainfed
agriculture, mainly along the northwestern Mediterranean coastal region. This
region extends about 500 km from El Saloum in the west to Alexandria in the east
and is bounded on the north by the Mediterranean Sea and on the south by the
Sahara Desert. The region enjoys a moderate Mediterranean coastal climate with an
average rainfall of about 170 mm in the east and 100 mm in the west.
4.       In pursuit of its strategy of sustainable agricultural development and
poverty alleviation among its tribal population, GOB is trying to realize the
maximum potential from the limited resources in these extensive dryland
farming/grazing areas of the Northwest Coastal Zone (NWCZ). GOB is also committed
to managing NWCZ natural resources in an environmentally sensitive manner. Given
these priorities, in October 1990 IDA cooperated with GOE to identify a natural
resource management and agricultural project for the Matruh Governorate in NWCZ.
The project feasibility study was prepared by GOB in 1991, using a local team
financed by Japanese and UNDP grants. The Bedouin population is traditionally an
isolated tribal society whose leadership performs many administrativr and judicial
functions.  There has been very little access to, and interaction r .h, external
assistance until recently. An innovative aspect of project preparation has been
the use of a narticivatory rural assessment (PRA). This approach ensures the
involvement of the target beneficiaries in the appropriate design and
implementation of project interventions. It has helped to foster proper



appreciation for the development constraints that characterize the area, the
priorities of the Bedouin population and the social dynamics that could affect the
efficiency of project implementation. This process promotes project ownership by
the local population and strengthens the sense of partnership between IDA,
government representatives and the local communities.
s.       Proect Objectves. The project would implement the Government' a strategy
for na_ural resource management in dryland areas. The main purpose of the project
is to break the cycle of natural resource degradation and poverty by providing
support for improved natural resource management approaches and practices, coupled
with agricultural development. This would be accomplished by utilizing the
existing tribal structure and encouraging the maximum participation of the local
population. The cycle of degradation within the fragile ecosystems of the project
area is aggravated by the settling of the once nomadic Bedouin population. This
population now exploits the natural resources with little attention to proper
conservation.
6.       Project Description. The Matruh Resource Management Project (MRMP) is
designed to assist the population in making the best use of the limited natural
resources available. The main components of the project would include:
* Natural resource manaaement, which would aim at conserving the water,
land and vegetation in the area. This component would focus on the
effective utilization of surface water flow, through watershed
management on about 6,000 feddans (2,520 ha) and water harvesting, and
on the management and sustainable use of land and vegetative cover by
the local population and their small livestock. The project would
provide: (a) 800 underground cisterns; (b) earth and stone contour
dikes on 6,200 feddans (2,600 ha) to intercept and retard rain water
runoff on slopes; and (c) cemented stone or gabion dikes across wadis
to intercept wadi flows and form fertile terraces for establishing
about 500 feddans of new fruit orchards. The rangeland management
activities would focus on about 14,000 feddans (5,900 ha) and plant
about 200 km of windbreaks.
* Adantive research and extension, which would focus on dryland farming
and livestock production systems, range management, sustainable
agricultural development and training directed to local communities.
The project would strengthen adaptive research and agricultural
extension, which would identify, test and promote relevant
technologies designed to conserve natural resources and sustain and
improve rainfed agricultural productivity. The project would
reorganize existing research and extension services. Four subregional
support centers, built to bring research and extension services closer
to the beneficiaries, would be supported with adequate staffing,
technical assistance, vehicles, equipment and materials.
* Rural finance, which would give special attention to the promotion of
on-farm and off-farm income-generating activities targeted to small
farniers, the landless and rural women. A modest credit fund would be
provided for environmentally safe and beneficial activities. The
mobilization of rural savings would be encouraged.
* A orolect coordination unit, which would aim at strengthening
community participation and the dialogue with existing local
institutions. The unit would also include a monitoring and evaluation
component to oversee project impact on local communities and on the
agro-ecosystems.



7.       Project Cost and Fnancg. The total project costs are estimated at LE 124 .0
million or US$29.5 million equivelent, of which US$12.4 million equivalent, or 4Z.
percent of the total costs, is the foreign exchange component. The proposed IDA
credit of SDR 15.9 million (US$22.0 million equivalent) would finance about 75
percent of the total project costs. The Government and the beneficiaries would
finance US$7.5 million equivalent, representing about 25 percent of the total
project costs. Project costs and financing are presented in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursement are shown in Schedule B. The
timetable of key processing events and the status of the Bank Group operations in
Egypt are provided in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map (IBRD 24577) and a
Technical Annex are also attached.
8.       Project Implementation. A project coordination unit (PCU) would be
established. The PCU would operate through existing government organizations in
the Matruh Governorate to assist, primarily, with project planning, coordination,
monitoring and financial control. While some additional staff would need to be
recruited, in most cases the staff are already in place, or posts have been
established but not yet filled. The PCU would set up a participatory process at
the commmunity level based on Community Groups (CGs), which would allow the local
population to work with project technicians and local officials to identify the
development potential and constraints in their specific areas and plan and
implement activities that would respond to their priorities. The CG would be the
basic project implementation organization. By using small, socially coherent and
manageable planning units, Community Action Plans (CAPs) would be developed to
carry out the analysis of the natural resource base and an assessment of the
sustainE.ble development possibilities. Realistic development plans would be
outlined and community-based investment programs, formulated and implemented.
9.       Project Sustinabity. Project components have been designed to facilitate
the project's sustainability. Specifically, the role of the PCU is temporary,
and, by the end of the implementation period, the interface between the local
communities and the implementing agencies would be strong enough to phase out the
PCU function. However, this would depend, in large part, on the commitment by the
Government, on the continued involvement of the local population and on the
viability of the proposed interventions. The Government is increasingly concerned
with the sustainable management of the natural resource base. It has taken the
lead during project preparation in initiating the participatory approach with the
local population. By directly involving the beneficiaries, it becomes possible to
match the limited support services and budget that the Government can make
available in such areas with thEi sustainable management of the natural resource
base and the requirements of tha people. The adaptive research activities are
expected to strengthen the technical base for sustainability.
10.      LeSSOnS Learned from Previous Bank Group Involvement. This is the first IDA-
financed natural resource management project for Egypt. Reviews of natural
resource management projects, which are relatively new to Bank Group activities,
highlight the need for greater participation of the beneficiaries in project
preparation and for a more decentralized project management. Reviews have
emphasized the need for securing the support of local communities, not only in
planning but also during implementation, and for simplifying organizational
arrangements to ensure close coordination among participating institutions. These
lessons have been reflected in the proposed project.
11.      RadIonae for IDA Involvement. The proposed project is part of the
investment program included in the Environmental Action Plan, which was supported
during the Donors Round Table Conference held in Cairo in May 1992. It forms part
/of the IDA country assistance strateav for Egypt, which focusses on environmental



and sustainability issues and poverty alleviation. It cpmplements the Bank's
lending portfolio in the sector and responds to the Government's priorities. The
project addresses the objectives of improved natural resource management in an
arid zone and includes income-generating activities in agriculture and agro-
processing which will improve farm family income. The project would mainly
benefit the Bedouin communities, including women, who represent a significant part
of the so-called ultra poor. The Matruh region, one of the less developed parts
of the country, offers some growth prospects; the region is in a state of rapid
change and is in need of rational, integrated development to protect and develop
its natural resources. The project would have significant replication potential
in other dry farming areas in Egypt and across the region. IDA would play an
important role by assisting GOB in promoting natural resource management based on
community participation to assist in the social and economic development of this
depressed region.
12.      Agreed Actions. GOB has nominated the National Coordinator for the project
and the Project Director General for the PCU. GOB also provided suitable sites
for the construction of the Matruh Resource Management Center (I!RMC) and four
Subregional Support Centers (SRSCs). At negotiations, GOB agreed to: (a) the
preparation of two community action plans for implementation during the first year
of the project; (b) the establishment of an International Advisory Panel for
reviewing MRMC's adaptive research program; (c) the timetable for the nomination
of key project staff with qualifications and terms of reference acceptable to IDA;
(d) the establishment of the PCU with office facilities; (e) interim reviews of
the project to be carried out jointly by IDA and GOB; (f) the provision of
sufficient counterpart funds in a timely mannet to cover project recurrent costs;
(g) the procedures for the preparation of the Community Action Plans (CAPs) to be
developed and agreed upon with the active involvement of the local community
groups (CGs); (h) the provision of grant assistance for water harvesting works;
(i) procurement arrangements; (j) appropriate reporting, including annual work
programs and project progress reports, accounting and auditing procedures; and (k)
interim reviews of the project to be carried out jointly by GOB and IDA.
13.      Anvironmentd ASpeCts. The project has been placed in environmental
screening Category "B" and has been subject to a field-based environmental review.
The environmental impact of the project is expected to be strongly positive. By
reducing runoff and increasing vegetative cover, the project would restore the
productivity of degraded soils and improve prospects for sustainable natural
resource management on degraded land in the regional watersheds and on the
rangelands. The promotion of water management/conservation and fruit tree
planting in the coastal zone, as foreseen under the project, would support the
transition to an ecologically more appropriate system of settled agriculture and,
at the same time, help to reduce erosion. The introduction of water conservation
methods and the planting of forage shrubs would, in the long term, contribute to
combatting desertification. To reduce any pollution risk, the project would adopt
the Bank/IDA guidelines in handling agro-chemicals and would promote integrated
pest management. An environmental mitigation plan has been prepared.
14.      BIo-dlversiy. The project activities are expected to enhance an
appreciation for bio-diversity concerns. Adaptive research and extension, the
improved management of rangelands and the promotion of nonagricultural income-
generating activities aim at the conservation of environmental resources. The
conservation of rangeland through deferred grazing would be beneficial to existing
plant species in the project area. While the project itself is not expected to
have negative effects on bio-diversity, most of the coastal zone, from Alexandria
to zl Alamein, as well as individual stretches further east, are now occupied by
hotels, resorts and vacation homes with severe damage threatening the environment.



. 5 -
Thus, while the scope of the project does not justify the establishment of bio-
diversity conservation areas, there is no doubt that planning and management
intervention could be beneficial to the Bedouins, especially in the areas east of
E1 Alamein. The World Bank-funded Mediterranean Environmental Technical
Ass3.stance Program (MET"P) will undertake a Coastal Zone Planning and Management
project with a specific focus on bio-diversity in the project area. Coordination
with the METAP prcgram will enhance the overall conservation focus of the NRMP.
15.      Beeflft. The main benefits from the project would be: (i) improved
sustainable natural resource managemenc carried out through local participatory
mechanisms; (ii) improved incomes and poverty reduction among the poorer segments
of the rural Bedouin population estimated to be about 61,000, through increased
agricultural production and the promotion of small-scale cottage and
agroindustries; and (iii) strengthened governorate and local Institutional
capabilities. The economic rate of return (ERR) is estimated at 12.1 percent.
Switching value analysis shows that incremental benefits would have to fall by 18
percent or costs to rise by 21 percent for the EER to equal the estimated
opportunity cost of capital (OCC) of 10 percent.
16.      RskS. There are three risks that could have a major impact on project
implementation (a) Poor untake of the particigatorv nlannincf annroach: The project
adopts an innovative approach, the preparation of a jointly agreed community
action plan, to identify priorities for development in the project area. The
effectiveness of the project in dealing with development priorities is, thus,
heavily dependent on the successful participation of the local communities in the
planning process. This, in turn, requires the communities, trust in the project.
Lack of participation on the part of the local population in project
implementation would also limit the effectiveness of the technical and credit
field services. To minimize the risk that the local communities would not fully
understand or participate in the project, their full involvement in the project
design was secured from the outset. Active community participation, using PRA
techniques, was an integral part of the preparation process. Also, the proposed
project organization relies on existing tribal structures as a key to project
implementation. (b) Poor credit untake: A number of factors could affect the
uptake of credit for project interventions, in particular, the Bedouins, lack of
experience with formal credit. This would be addressed by making formal credit
accessible, tailoring it to the needs of the Bedouin community and ensuring that
loans are supported by technical back-stopping. The credit activities proposed
under the project show attractive returns to the investors. (c) Limited
institutional coordination: The implementing agencies lack practical experience in
working together at the community level. Close cooperation began during
preparation, and coordinating arrangements should reduce the risk of inadequate
coordination; however, actual performance would require careful monitoring,
particularly during the early years. Setting up coordination committees at the
national and regional levels, with defined terms of reference, would strengthen
cooperation among participating agencies. A national coordinator for the project
has already been nominated.
17.      Itcommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.

1. THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR
Importance In the Economy
1.1      Although agriculture has been one of the main sources of economic growth
in Egypt, its relative importance has been declining in recent years. In 1974,
agriculture accounted for 30 percent of GDP in real terms, 25 percent of exports
and about 47 percent of employment. By 1990, agriculture's contribution to the
economy had declined to 20 percent of GDP and 20 percent of commodity exports; it
employed only about 33 percent of the labor force. The relative decline in
agriculture reflects faster growth in other sectors, and a declining share in
public investment, accompanied by a less-than-optimum allocation between
agricultural subsectors, including emphasis oa the reclamation of new lands.
1.2      In real terms, agricultural GDP grew at an average annual rate of 2.7
percent in the 1960s, increasing to 3.5 percent in the 1970s. However, once the
gains in cropping intensity, made possible by controlled water releases from the
Aswan Dam, were realized, the agricultural growth rate in the 1980s, on average,
fell to around 2.5 percent lower than the growth rate of the economy, and slightly
lower than the population growth rate. The situation was aggravated by policy
distortions (in prices, subsidies, marketing, trade, etc.) and rapid population
growth.
Main Constraints
1.3      The main constraints to agriculture in Egypt are limited water and land
resources, coupled with policy and institutional constraints. Starting in 1986,
the Government made a concerted effort to undertake policy reforms, including
phasing out area and price controls and input subsidies. Additional efforts,
however, are required to eliminate remaining policy constraints. The construction
of the Aswan Dam enabled the flow of the Nile to be captured, and the Egypt-Sudan
treaty allocated 55.5 billion cubic meters (SCM) annually to Egypt. Of this,
about 32-33 BCM represent crop use. Improved management of the 55.5 BCM and
reduced outflows to the Mediterranean could increase water availability for
agriculture by 6-8 BCM by the year 2000. However, high salinity will limit the
reuse of drainage water.
1.4      Although Egypt has a land area of one million square kilometers (km2),
only about 3 percent of the total area (or 7.5 million feddans) is cultivated,
resulting in one of the world's lowest per capita levels of agriculturally
productive laud, i.e., 0.13 fed, or 0.05 ha per capita. About 23,000 km2 (5.4
million fed) are alluvial soils of the Nile Valley and Delta; the balance consists
of calcareous and sandy soils of reclaimed lands. The land constraint is
exacerbated by declining productivity in some areas, due to waterlogging and
excessive salinity.
1.5      Rainfed agriculture in Egypt occupies about 2-3 percent of agricultural
land. Although this may not appear significant in relation to the total
agricultural land, it is important to local communities and economies. Better
management of resources would contribute to the conservation of natural resources
and better sustain the livelihood of local communities. The latter are important
objectives of Egypt's Environmental Action Plan.
1.6      The major policy distortions in agriculture arose from controls on areas,
production and the prices of crops (mostly set below international market prices);
the Government monopoly in the marketing of major crops and the distribution of

inputs, an overvalued and multiple exchange rate regime that gave rise to an anti-
export bias and discriminated against the private sector; trade restrictions on
the import and/or export of various commodities; subsidies for the main inputs;
the ban on the production of certain kinds of agricultural machinery and
equipment; and highly negative interest rates in real terms. Another major
distortion was the provision of irrigation water and drainage facilities virtually
free of charge to farmers.
1.7      While additional reforms are needed in pricing and marketing policy,
institutional constraints are also very limiting. These include planning,
coordination, and project/program implementation, both within and among ministries
involved in agricultural development. Financial or budgetary constraints are
likely to be severe, making it particularly important to achieve greater cost
recovery for services and infrastructure provided to the private sector.
Reform Progm In Agriculture
1.8      The Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation (MALR) led the
adjustment effort in Egypt. In 1986, and within the framework of its strategy for
the agriculture sector for the 1980s, MALR launched a reform program aimed at
liberalizing and transforming the agriculture sector to one basically responsive
to market forces. The central objective of the reforms was to increase production
and income through efficient resource use. To attain that objective, several
measures have been implemented since 1986, including: (a) the removal of crop area
allotments with delivery quotas for all major crops except sugarcane; (b) the
liberalization of agricultural producer prices for all products, except cotton and
sugarcane. Cotton procurement prices were raised to two thirds of international
prices as part of Egypt's structural adjustment program. Plans are now to
completely liberalize marketing and pricing of cotton; (c) significant reductions
in subsidies on fertilizers and pesticides which are expected to be phased out in
1993 or shortly thereafter; (d) privatization of reclaimed public lands is
progressing, and a program for the divestiture of the assets of the public
production companies has been initiated; (e) interest rates are now basically
market-determined as elsewhere in the economy; and (f) trade and marketing
restrictions are being relaxed, including the monopoly of the Principal Bank for
Development and Agriculture Credit (PBDAC) on input distribution.
1.9      Macroeconomic and sectoral reforms introduced so far have reduced
distortions and preliminary data indicate some improvement in efficiency of
resource use in the agriculture sector leading to an increase in production of
some crops and a decrease in the output of others. Changes in technology --
leading to yield increases -- have also contributed to increases in output.
1.10     The most important constraint for the future expansion of the
agricultural sector is the water availability. This calls for improving the
efficiency of on-farm water usage, as well as proper maintenance of the irrigation
and drainage systems to ensure the long-term sustainability of the system. Issues
of efficient management of the scarce water resource are admittedly, socially and
politically sensitive. Ecwever, in order to achieve the goals of system
sustainability, various technical solutions and economic policy options should
receive due consideration.
1.11     The Bank's strategy in the agriculture sector in Egypt focusses on the
following initiatives: continued policy liberalization including prices and
markets; increased resource use efficiency (both of water and land); improved
institutional efficiency and increased private sector participation;

Page 3 of 30
intensification of production and more efficient use of already reclaimed lands;
generation and transfer of new technology; human resource development; and poverty
reduction.
Bank Group Participation In Agicultu
1.12     There are six projects under implementation in agriculture, having a
total lQan value of US$379 million equivalent. Past investment lending focussed
heavily on projects in the irrigation/drainage subsector (financing time slices of
the drainage program, rehabilitation of irrigation pumping stations, channel
maintenance) and which address both water and land use efficiency. The completion
of the drainage program is a high priority for the Government of Egypt (GOB), and
Bank Group participation has assisted in attracting financing from other donors.
In addition, there are on-going projects in agricultural storage and agricultural
development, both being implemented by PBDAC. A Technical Assistance Project,
designed to improve the planning capacity in MALR and Ministry of Public Works and
Water Resources (MPWWR), which was partially successful, has been recently closed.
The Bank also serves as the executing agency for three agricultural projects
financed by IFAD (Minya, Fayoum, and West Beheira), and a UNDP-financed Water
Security Project.
Future Direction of Agricural Development
1.13     GOE has undertaken far-reaching reforms in agriculture, and dialogue with
the Bank is continuing to further strengthen the reform program. Underpinning the
dialogue is a recently completed Agricultural Sector Strategy Study for the 19908,
undertaken at Government's request by a joint Government-donor group (World Bank,
TNDP, FAO). Findings of the study indicate: (a) a need to implement measures
aimed at ensuring efficiency and environmental sustainability in the management
and utilization of the country's most important natural resources - land and
water; (b) a need to emphasize free market mechanisms and, in particular, promote
the role of the private sector; (c) the need for implementing measures for the
agriculture sector within the context of a viable macro-economic framework and an
overall rural development strategy, including provision of social key services,
especially intensification of health and education programs; (d) the need for
social safety nets to help absorb some of the effects of the reform program; and
(e) the need to initiate a program of institutional reforms.
2. PROJECT AREA
Location and Climate
2.1      L0cationand Clmate. The northwest coastal zone (NWCZ) extends for about
500 km from the Libyan border in the west to Alexandria in the east (Map, IBRD No.
24577). It is bounded on the north by the Mediterranean Sea and on the south by
the Sahara Desert, some SO to So km inland. The project boundaries are formed by
the Libyan border to the west near E1 Saloum and the eastern edge of Marsa Matruh
district near Ras El Hikma, some 280 km away, the Mediterranean Sea to the north,
and about 40 km inland to the south which is the approximate southern boundary of
the community grazing lands. The area selected is of manageable proportions,
where proposed project interventions could have a significant economic impact, and
could offer a good basis for future replication within Matruh Governorate and
elsewhere within the region, where agro-climatic conditions are similar. In
general, the climate varies from a moderate Mediterranean coastal climate in the
north to a desert climate in the south. The average annual rainfall along the



-4-
Page 4 of 30
coast and inland for about 20 km ranges from about 170 mm in the east to 100 Mm in
the west. Beyond 20 km from the coast it drops to about half that amount.
Throughout the area, rainfall is characterized by extreme annual variations.
2.2      Topography and Land Use. The NWCZ consists of a narrow, almost
uninterrupted, band of coastal and inland sand dunes and interdunal plains.
Further inland there is an alluvial plain that slopes gradually upward to the
Libyan plateau. The area is bisected by numerous wadis formed by runoff water
from the northward sloping plateau and eroded escarpment. Soil from the plateau
and upper slopes of the wadis accumulates on the lower section below the
escarpment to form local areas of deep and relatively more fertile soil.
2.3      There are four agro-ecological zones in the project area.  First, a
coastal strin covering about 144,000 feddans (60,500 ha) and having a maximum
width of about S km. The inhabitants are settled and the strip has good alluvial
soils derived from the wadis. Average annual rainfall varies from 100 to 170 mm.
Fruit trees and vegetables are cultivated.
2.4      The second, a mixed 2roduction strin, covering .bout 700,000 feddans
(294,000 ha) and ranging from 5 km to 1S km inland, has a rather lower rainfall
and relatively low permeability soils. The population here is settled and it
supports a mixed sheep and goat breeding-cum-barley farming system, except in wadi
beds where fruit trees could be grown. Even in low rainfall years some barley
grain can be harvested for seed and the rest is grazed. Only once in five years
is enough barley produced for a surplus to be sold or used as animal feed.
2.5      The third, a ranaeland strin, covers about 2.50 million feddans (1.05
million ha) and ranges from 15 km to 40 km inland. The lack of water is the
limiting factor for agriculture and livestock rearing. Average annual rainfall is
50 to 100 mm. It is largely used for seasonal sheep and goat grazing, with
scattered barley cultivation in depressions. The population is semi-nomadic. The
fourJth stri lies beyond 50 km inland. The population is entirely nomadic and
land use is only for livestock, especially camel, grazing.
Bedouin Society and Soi Structure
2.6      PopulatIo. The total population of the project area is estimated to be
about 190,000 people, of whom 85 percent belong to Bedouin tribes; the remaining
15 percent are immigrants from the Nile Valley (or oasis inhabitants). This
population is among the poorest and most deprived in Egypt and hence GOB' s concern
about the improvement of their living standards. The population of Marsa Matruh,
the largest town and the administrative center of the area, is about S0,000. The
two other sizeable towns are Sidi Barrani and E1 Saloum, with a combined
population of about 10,000. Some of the Bedouins live in urban areas but most are
living in permanent housing in dispersed rural settlements. At present, the
livelihood of about 75 percent of the population depends on agriculture (crop and
livestock production). The primary economic unit is the extended family
household, which averages about 11 persons in the region, and there is only a
limited role at present for the nuclear family as a separate social unit.
2.7      The Awlad 'Ali tribal structure is the existing on-the-ground system for
resource management, and is based on a representative system in which individual
tribesmen have defined rights of access to the recognized authorities. Land and
water resources have been managed primarily at the level of the clan (A"), which
has primary access to a specific territory (xVan) and the extended family
household. Problems of coordination or specific disputes which arise between

century (as the tribes entered the
region from Libya), and includes
a legal code for moral and civil offenses, rules of order for the tribal judicial
process, and a system of legal specialists.   Several tribal groups are recognized
locally as having the expertise on judicial matters. For example, issues relating
to camel herding are dealt with by the al-Zarai' of the al-Arawa tribe, with
those of herding by the Badi al-Sharasat; agricultural matters are the concern of
the al--Zafarat of the al-'Ushaybat tribe.   The legal principles are both written
and verbal. There are a number of principles and mutually accepted rules for use
of land, water, vegetation and animals. It is important to note that as nomads the
Bedouin did not have free and unrestricted access to pasture. Rather, there were
rules to ensure distribution of access rights and conservation of water and
pasture.
2.9      Iand Tenure. Officially, all steppe and desert land in Egypt belongs to
the government. In traditional Bedouin practice, land was communally owned.
Individuals and households did not hold formal title to land, as recognized by the
government. The government recognizes the de facto usufruct rights of established
tribal territories.  The Desert Law 124 of 1958 and Law 100 of 1969 allowed
individual tribesmen to gain title over land they cultivated according to certain
criteria. Yet, it is estimated that 88 percent of cultivated holdings in Matruh
Governorate are still under traditional tenure without legal title. Furthermore,
Law 17 of 1969 empowered the government to lease or sell state land to companies
or individuals for projects considered to be in the national interest.
2.10     There have traditionally b^-c struggles over land ownership and water
rights between the tribes. Today, the inter-tribal disputes are largely under the
control of the authorities and common borders have been agreed. Under the
traditional system individual land ownership is lacking. Those who cultivate the
land or habitually and traditionally use it have claims to it, but the land is
communally owned. Nevertheless, with the exception of areas in the southernmost
parts of the project, the tribal territory is no longer communal or collectively
cultivated by members of the tribe to which the land belongs. Rather, it has been
allocated to individual tribesmen in such a way that each landholder knows quite
well the shape and boundaries of his share in the tribal area; this is in
accordance with the principle 'Wada El-Yad', meaning literally 'putting one's hand

on'. With continued use the land becomes virtually owned, *n the sense that the
claimant has exclusive rights to its use.
2.11     Communal Grazing Rights. In Bedouin society, communal land ownership means
that the members of each tribe and sub-tribe have an exclusive right to graze
their flocks on the area allocated to their tribe/sub-tribe. Members of tribes
are forbidden from grazing their animals in the area of another tribe without the
latter's express permission. Within the territory of a sub-tribe there do not
appear to be any traditional measures to control numbers of animals or the way in
which the range is grazed. However, the grazing lands in the settled zone are
increasingly allocated to individual families.
2.12     Water ighbts. Each tribe has its own sources of water and it respects the
territorial boundaries of others. Generally, water trapped by smaller dikes and
other water harvesting structures is used for agricultural production. Water
rights and disputes are subject to tribal laws which can mean, in case there is
not enough well water to meet household's domestic and production needs, that a
household has the right to use the nearest available stored water, regardless of
whom it may belong to.
Women In Bedon Sociey
2.13    T'radIional Atttudes Toward the Divsion of Labor. In the traditional pastoral
society, both men and women participated in the livestock management. Bedouin
women in the past were far less restricted in their economic and public roles than
at present. While sedentarization restricted women's mobility, intensification of
agricultural activities, tree plantation and maintenance, and the provision of
water and firewood all brought new responsibilities to women. Nevertheless,
gender segregation has increased with the urbanization and development of tourism
and with greater exposure to religious centers.
2.14     Productive and ncome-generat  Acivities. Women have always contributed
substantially to'maintenance and production of flocks. Today, rural women are
involved in a number of agricultural activities, including harvesting and
processing. Among the traditional activities which now have a potential market in
the cities are rug and blanket weaving. Bedouin weaving is in great demand,
especially as a tourist item, although in the past it was only for local
consumption. There is, at present, no established market outlet for the artifacts
of Bedouin women, who are poorly compensated by merchants and middlemen.
Rural Poverty
2.15     Poverty in rural Egypt is closely linked to agriculture.  The rural
population accounts for about 54 percent of the total population, and farmers and
farm laborers represent a large proportion of the rural poor. Despite the overall
reduction in poverty, the poorest 20 percent of landowners hold only 5 percent of
agricultural land. Slow growth in the rural economy and limited employment
opportunities have accelerated rural migration, predominantly of adult male labor
to urban areas and the Gulf countries. As a result, nearly one half of the active
female population are engaged in agriculture, particularly in livestock
operations. Among the poor, rural women and the landless are particularly
disadvantaged. Besides illiteracy, lack of access to services, such as credit and
extension, are among the main constraints faced by women farmers.
2.16     The preparation report estimated that the poverty income level
(subsistence income) in 1990/91 in the project area was around Egyptian Pounds



-7 -TEIMICAT,A
, Page 7 of 30
(LE) 500 per capita per annum (nearly LE 300 to meet minimum food requirements and
the rest to satisfy other needs). Allowing for inflation, the level of poverty
income would be around LE 590 per capita in 1992. Estimates by the appraisal
mission indicate that in an average year the net ner canita farm income from crops
and livestock was LX 193 for small farmers (2.5 ha, or 6 fed, and lese than 20
sheep) who make up about 50 percent of beneficiaries, LE 463 for medium farmers
(7.5 ha, or 18 fed, and 50 sheep), and LE 1,375 for large farmers (21 ha, or SO
fed and 200 sheep). The incidence of drought in the project area is common and
aggravates the poverty problem in any given year.
2.17     The preparation report estimated that non-agricultural income in 1988
accounted for 37-5S percent of total income in the project area (average of 46
percent). On that basis, when Mon-farm inacom is included, total average annual
per capita income as estimated by the mission would be about LE 420, LI 1,007 and
LE 2,990 for the small, medium and large farmers, respectively. These incomes
fall below the poverty line for the small farmers who form one- half of the
farmers in the project area, but exceed the poverty level for medium and large
farmers, except in drought years when it could be lower than the average also for
medium farmers. Even when non-farm income is also included, per capita total
.ncome of medium farmers would still be considerably lower than per capita GDP of
about LE 1900 in 1990/91 for Egypt as a whole.

2.18     In  the  Northern  areas  of  the           LEad Use $4gJPrW Anae
M-atruh Governorate, land use is entirely
dependent on  rainfall,  and cultivation

harvesting.  The local population, mainly                         48
sedouin, practices primarily a sheep/goat-
barley-tree crop  farming system.   This
system provides income to an estimated 85
percent of the popalation. In the last two
decades,  the  Government has encouraged
settlement of Bedouin communities and this
is changing the traditional dominance of
livestock  to  a  more  settled  form  of          § §ttv"d
agriculture.  The passage from traditional                                       7
pastoralism to a more sedentary agriculture
without adequate  technical support has
contributed to natural resource degradation sane« 
(overgsazing, and soil erosion).                __
2.19     The potential area for the entire
NWCZ for orchards could reach 200,000 feddans, and for barley 500,000 feddans.  In
1992, the major crops occupied around 127,000 feddans in the project area.
Cereals account for about 75 percent of this area, while orchards account for 15
percent and vegetables for less than 10 percent. Barley, both for food grain and
fodder, is the most important crop and, depending on rainfall, cereals cover
between 80,000-100,000 feddans. Barley yields vary between 250-300 kg/ha of grain
and 300-360 kg/ha of straw. The total area under fruit trees is about 20,000
feddans divided between 5,000 feddans of olives, 13,000 feddans of figs, and the
rest consisting of almonds, grapes and other fruit trees. Pistachio appears to be
a potential crop for the region. Yields of different fruit species vary from one
site to another, depending mainly on the type of soil, the availability of soil



-8-
Page 8 of 30
moisture, orchard management, and peut control. Vegetable area varies between
8,000 and 13,000 feddans, depending on rainfall. The main vegetables are
watermeloa, onion, broad beans and tomatoes. Past and current agricultural
research and development activities have established valuable databases,
knowledge, and development experiences in the region. As a consequence, a number
of appropriate technologies have been developed and tested that could be
immediately utilized by the project. For example, improved barley production
technology in average and relatively better rainfall years could potentially
double the current production level. Similarly, vegetable production could be
significantly increased through the use of plastic green houses. The yield from
fruit crops could be increased 2-3 times the current levels through improved plant
management and better varieties. wide-scale use of appropriate water harvesting
methods and soil conservation techniques, application of animal manure and mineral
fertilizers, crop rotation, tillage practices, proper pruning, introduction of
improved germ plasm, and integrated pest management (IPM) also have the potential
for increasing and sustaining crop productivity from scarce natural resources of
the area.
Water Use
2.20     Water, which is the limiting factor for agriculture in the region, is
derived from rainfall runoff and groundwater. Water conservation and water
harvesting techniques to retain rainfall runoff in the north, range from
constructing dikes, to cultivating in depressions using in situ collected
rainfall, and underground cisterns for collection and storage of rainwater.
Cisterns, hand-dug in rock, can be used for domestic and livestock drinking water
as well as for supplemental irrigation for tree production. There are about
12,000 cisterns in the area with capacities ranging from S0 to 3,000 i3. Farmers
often have several different cisterns, being used separately for drinking water
for humans, for livestock or for irrigation.
2.21     Dikes are of chree main types: (i) check dikes constructed to prevent the
flow of wadi runoff from reaching the sea; (ii) diversion dikes to spread water
onto an area to be cropped; and (iii) terrace dikes on agricultural soils to
assist with water harvesting, build up fertility, replenish groundwater and
prevent soil erosion.
2.22     Groundwater occurs as artesian wells or as free groundwater.  Water
suitable for agricultural purposes occurs in shallow non-artesian aquifers which
are recharged directly by rainfall and infiltration from surface runoff. There
are three means of obtaining groundwater: aallerieg (many of them dating back to
Roman times), sanias (free artesian wells recharged from depression and wadis) and
wells. These are the main source of water supply in the coastal strip, whereas
the cistern becomes the main source further inland.
Livestock Production
2.23     There are approximately half a million animals in the area, of which
about 95 percent are sheep and goats, 2 percent donkeys, 2 percent camels and less
than 1 percent cattle. The ratio of sheep to goats is about 4:1. Poultry are
mostly kept under traditional extensive systems for household meat and eggs,
although there are a few commercial flocks as well.
2.24     Sheep and goat production makes a significant contribution of about 50-70
percent to farm income. Lack of water limits inland range grazing to 4-5 months
during the rainy season. In good rainfall years, barley is harvested and the dry



-9 -TECKNX                               X
,  Page 9 of 30
stubble is grazed; in dry years, the crop is grazed green. The barley/sheep/goat
farming system (para. 2.18) is principally directed towards the production and
sale of lambs/kids of about 6-8 months of age.
2.25     The above production system is dependent on supplemental feeding for
fattening. Supplementary feed used to be provided through cooperatives at
subsidized prices but, with the removal of the subsidy in 1991, it is increasingly
provided by the private sector. The economic adjustments during the early 1990s
are expected to lead to a slight reduction in livestock numbers,
2.26     Transhumance is also an important feature of flock/herd management
whereby animals are moved inland for rangeland grazing during the rainy season and
returned to the coastal mixed farm/rangeland during the dry season. In years of
drought, about 30 percent of the sheep are moved to the Nile Valley, surviving on
available crop residues and purchased fodder, but with an increased risk of
attracting diseases and internal parasites, hence requiring treatment upon the
flocks' return to their native rangelands.
infrasture
2.27     Communications are good along the coast with a single line railway and a
new highway. The latter is also connected to beach areas which are being
extensively developed for tourism. Inland, there are some dirt roads in poor
condition. Electricity is supplied from local generating plants in Marsa Matruh
and Sidi Barrani and El Saloum. Private generating plants supply electricity to
hotels and tourist villages. Drinking water comes by pipeline from Alexandria,
and by tanker railway cars which are used to fill local cisterns. There are also
five desalination plants with a combined total daily capacity of about 1,600 m3.
Otherwise, villages rely on water stored in cisterns. School facilities are
limited, with most schools located within 10 km of the coast. There are also
five public hospitals.
Instuional Setting
Local Government Suctue
2.28     Although the central government still has the final say over matters of
policy and allocation of resources, the Governorate now has considerable freedom
to deal with administrative matters and execute development plans. The Governor
is the most senior government official in the area. He is directly in charge of
the Matruh Executive Governorate Council and the District Councils. The
Governorate Council comprises the heads of the District Councils and the heads of
each of the servica directorates, which include the Agricultural Directorate and
the Matruh Development and Reconstruction Sector (MDRS), the two bodies most
integrally involved with project execution. The District Councils are similarly
constituted bodies at the district level. The representatives are responsible
ultimately to the Governor, but major planning and policy decisions by the
technical line departments/directorates need approval of the ministries in Cairo.
This split in responsibility can sometimes cause difficulties but, in general,
does not interfere with the decision-making process.
2.29     The Ministry of Aariculture and Land Reclamation (MALR) operates in the
project area through the: Directorate of Agriculture, Directorate of Veterinary
Services (DVS), Inspectorate of Agricultural Cooperatives, Matruh Bank of
Development and Agricultural Credit (MBDAC), and a small local station of the
Agricultural Research Center (ARC). All are based at Marsa Matruh, except for the

Page 10 of 30
Matruh Agricultural Research Center which is located at El-Qasr, just outside the
city.
2.30     The General Directorate of Acriculture (GDA) which comprises six
technical directorates' is severely constrained by inadequate operating budgets
and staff shortages. Although there is an adequate number of positions
authorized, some remain vacant due to unattractive salaries and difficulty in
attracting people to the area.
2.31     The Authority for Development and Reconstruction of the North Coast
(under the Ministry of Development), New Communities, Housing and Public
Utilities, operates four sectors of which the Matruh Development and
Reconstruction Sector (MWRS) is primarily involved with rural development. MDRS
is involved with infrastructure development, such as feeder roads, dikes and
cisterns, financed mainly by the World Food Programme (WFP). It operates a
Collaborative Agreement Department which is responsible for monitoring bilateral
agreements with national programs and international projects. Despite the
activities of this department, there is weak coordination among donors and
implementing agencies.
2.32     The Directorate of Social Affairs (DSA) implements a small loans program
through the Association of Productive Families, a non-governmental organization.
The DSA provides training and disburses subsidized loans up to LE 400 for micro-
enterprises under a small loan program. The DSA also assists in marketing; it
operates a show room in Marsa Matruh which sells products of members, such as
processed food products, carpets, clothes, handicrafts, leather goods, etc.
Agricultwal Support Services
2.33     Research. There is no organized agricultural research program for the NWCZ
nor for the project area. Neither is there a well-defined policy framework within
which research is currently carried out. The general government policy to assist
the Bedouins has provided limited orientation to research efforts directed to the
area, with some emphasis on intensifying production under changing socio-economic
conditions, use of surface water, and improved management of rangelands with less
mobility of livestock. However, efforts have been largely ad hoc and
uncoordinated with impetus coming from centrally-run programs, university-
initiated studies, or more often, from resident internationally-funded projects,
such as those funded by GTZ, FAO, UNDP, WFP, and Cooperative Arid Lands
Agricultural Research (CALAR). While these initiatives are useful and add to the
general knowledge in the area, they cannot substitute for a properly organized,
targeted and interactive research program that responds to the specific needs of
the area. Consequently, there is no effective mechanism to trouble-shoot problems
that occur at the producer level, to identify priorities for adaptive research
programs, and to facilitate regular updating of ongoing research and extension
programs. As a result, the performance of research in meeting the needs of the
area has been poor.
2.34     The two bodies that carry the mandate for research in the area are:  the
AGricultural Research Center (ARC) and the Desert Research Center (DRC). Both
have their headquarters in Cairo. The former has recently established the Matruh
a/   Livestock, Horticulture, Extension, Pest Control, Economics and
Statistics, and Agronomy.

Agricultural Research Station at E1 Qasr but while the latter has no permanent
physical presence in the area, it has only limited staff and facilities in Matruh.
2.35     Exbtendon. Formal extension services in Matruh Governorate were introduced
to the area only in the late eighties when the Directorate of Extension Services
(DES) was established. Previously, extension services were carried out through
MDRS (para. 2.31), which is still carrying out extension activities in conjunction
with the P, FAO and GTZ projects which directly or indirectly come under its
authority. MDRS currently has some 230 staff in the Governorate, including about
SO field staff in the three districts that fall within the project area. Few of
the MDRM staff have received agricultural training. In contrast, in spite of
MALR's Directorate of Extension Services having an establishment of 60 extension
agents posts, currently only 13 of them are filled. Few extension agents are of
Bedouin origin and contact with local communities remains limited. In addition to
the lack of staff, there is a shortage of vehicles and equipment. This has meant
that the Directorate's extension activities to date have been largely ineffective
and the flow of information from the field to research workers and vice versa is
nearly non-existent. Coordination amongst these entities has been inadequate.
2.36     The veterinary extension services are run separately from the
agricultural extension service described above. The veterinary services have been
successful in vaccination campaigns, disease control measures of regional
importance and in containing epidemic outbreaks. A small extension unit was
revived in 1990 to provide information to herders regarding the screw worm control
program. However, their activities in on-demand day-to-day treatment of livestock
are limited and may be available effectively only to larger producers.  There are
group animal health schemes but the lack of medicines/ dispensaries limits the
success of these schemes. Veterinarians are adequate in numbers but there is
shortage in laboratory equipment and supplies.
2.37     Training. There are no agricultural training establishments in NWCZ or for
dryland farming in Egypt in general. Training, which has, accordingly, been
limited, is normally provided on an ad hoc basis in conjunction with the pilot
projects in the area or trainees are sent either to Cairo or Alexandria, or
outside the country for specialized training. The training that has taken place
ia situ in the area has been the most successful and has had the longest lasting
results.
Farmers' Assocaions
2.38     Agricultural cooperatives are the only formal agro-pastoral associations
at the grassroots level and the principal institution for providing
farmers/graziers with crop and livestock inputs. The cooperative structure in the
Governorate comprises the central cooperative located in Marsa Matruh and 61 local
agricultural cooperative societies spread over the Governorate. The central
cooperative markets agricultural and animal products on behalf of producers
(notably olives and wool). It also serves as a conduit for soft loan programs
funded by donors. There are 36 local cooperatives in the project area which are
organized along the tribal structure. Most farmers are members of their local
cooperative. There is also a Livestock Owners Association.
Rua Mance
Availabyt of Rural Fmiance
2.39     in general, most Bedouin households self-finance their farm and non-farm
enterprises. Many of the farm enterprises are small. They lack collateral and
the cost and risks of credit delivery are perceived to be high, given the widely

scattered commmities and production risks in the area. They are not familiar

credit is provided by the Mat
Bank    for   Development    and
Aaricultural Credit (MBDAC). M8DAC opened the branch in Marsa Matruh in 1989 with
a mobile branch in Siwa. MBDAC is the major provider of rural credit with minimal
participation of commercial banks. There are three commercial banks operating
branches in Marsa Matruh but only one (the National Bank of Egypt) is providing
short-term loans to agriculture. Agricultural credit channelled through MBDAC is
still limited. It concerns mainly equipment loans (trucks, generators, etc.).
Loans for chemicals and mineral fertilizers is still relatively limited because of
their limited use.
2.41     The rural population is more familiar with grants and soft loans since
the Governorate has been a recipient of substantial amounts of funds from
Government and donors to support the program of settling the formerly nomadic
Bedouins. While soft loans cost from zero to 6 percent per annum, and in some
cases 10 percent in terms of a one-time service charge, regular bank loans
currently carry interest rates ranging between 16 percent and 21 percent per
annum.
2.42     it is estimated that about one-third of the families in the area have
benefited from financial assistance in one form or another, but there is still a
long waiting list of these requesting assistance. While a large number of
families need funds for additional water harvesting structures and cisterns, other
need financing for farm machinery, livestock production, crop inputs, agro-
processing, and inoome generating rural enterprises. Rural women, too, have a
financing need of their own. They engage in small scale agricultural activities,
such as, mint production, raising small stock (chickens, rabbits, and pigeons),
weaving and handicraft. Income generated from these is retained by the women for
household use, savings and their own special needs.
2.43     The demand for credit in the project area has been slowly rising as a
result of falling grant financing by donors and Government and increasing exposure
of potential beneficiaries to on-farm and non-farm income generating
opportunities. Despite the lack of experience with formal credit, the Bedouin
population is reported to be willing to utilize bank loans for investment if these
were made available. With regard to the cost of credit, although their religion
forbids the payment of interest, they also recognize the need for banks to recover
their administrative costs by charging a commission or service fee as long as such
fee is made transparent and not called interest payment. Bedouins, according to

recent experiences, judge the acceptability of the level of interest (service)
charges on the basis of project profitability. However, service fees of over 20
percent could be considered usury.
Marketing and Markets
2.44     At the current level of development, the marketing of the agricultural
production has not been a major problem. The market system is dominated by
private traders and wholesalers large enough to ensure reasonable competition.
Cooperatives also market a sizeable portion of the production and further help
ensure that the producers receive a competitive price. In the case of livestock,
a strong local market demand, as well as in the Gulf countries, for the 'Barki'
sheep and goats produced in the area, ensures adequate markets. Libya was an
important market until the 19708 when the border with Egypt was closed.
Potentially, it still represents an important market outlet. Presently, the main
market is Saudi Arabia where prices for live animals are exceptionally high,
reaching as much as LE 200-300 per head. Annual offtake of lambs/kids is
estimated at about 300,000 head of which about one-third (total value - US$10
million) are exported. Only during drought years when producers have not been
able to get sufficient feed, have the prices been heavily discounted by the
surplus animals coming onto the market.
2.45     The marketing of fruits and vegetables has also not presented a problem
to date. However, low prices are sometimes received due to insufficient attention
to quality. Furthermore, a potential problem has been signalled regarding the
marketing of figs. Most are currently sold fresh to the markets in Alexandria and
Cairo. At the present levels of production, there has been no difficulty in
selling the output. However, with more areas reaching full bearing and new
orchards being established, it will be necessary to dry an increasing proportion
of the figs if the full production is to be sold at attractive prices. With
regard to olives, there is a strong market and disposing of the harvest is also
not expected to be a problem in the near future; however, if higher prices are to
be obtained, quality control would have to be improved.  Also, the establishment
of a marketing information service would be of assistance to the producers.
Experience of Development Projects In the Area
2.46     A WFP  irolect started in 1977 and is projected to continue at least to
1994. The project has had an important impact in the area. Assistance is
specifically aimed at facilitating sedentar4.zation of the Bedouin population; it
includes financing through food-for-work (predominantly as grants2) for cisterns,
dikes, fruit orchards, low cost housing and animal sheds.
2.47     The Eorvtian-German El Oasr Rural Develonment Proiect, supported by GTZ,
was initiated in 1988 and is due to be completed by mid-1994. This pilot project
has as one of its main aims to develop and test new ideas and approaches for rural
income-generation within a limited area and in a limited time frame.
Agricultural/social activities are the main focus of the project which attempts,
through pilot actions, to look at the constraints and problems in both
institutional and technical terms. The project has generally worked through
;JI   The recipients of the WFP assistance must pay 25%' of the value of the
food they receive; this money is used to create funds that are used
either to provide loans for agricultural purposes or for financing rural
infrastructure and training courses.

interest free "credit' and with the cooperatives to reach the Bedouins. Women's
development activities have been given a particular focus. Other activities
include the establishment of agro-meteorological stations, land-use planning
techniques and satellite mapping. So far, the main emphasis has been on testing
the technical and .social feasibility of interventions (improved cisterns, green
houses, etc.). Attention is now being directed to financial as well as technical
analysis.
2.48     The FAO/UNDP sanDorted -rt g?ct, which followed on after an PAD project of
the early and mid-seventies for the whole of NWC8, is scheduled to be completed in
mid-1993. This pilot project which focuses on the area east.of Marsa Matruh, aims
to increase agricultural productivity through the introduction of irrigation,
plastic green houses and modern agricultural practices. It also has been carrying
out trials on 8oil and water conservation works in wadisL and on rangeland       -
management.-
2.49     An ILO/DANIDA-su.Mo2ted oroject, which supports cooperatives and
training, gives support to the promotion and development of settlers' cooperatives
and provides some training for women trainers. It has also funded the
establishment of a training center in the project area.
2.50     Lessons learned during the implementation of the above mentioned projects
were reflected in the design of the proposed project. At the completion of R1
Qasr Project, a detailed report on successful technological packages would be
prepared. As well, close coordination would be maintained with WFP and PAO/UwvP
projects.
3. PROJECT RATIONALE AND OBJECTIV
Projct Objectives
3.1      The first objective of the project is to implement a program of
sustainahle natural resource management in order to conserve the water, land and
vegetative resources of the area. The second objective of the project is to
alleviate poverty and to improve the quality of life of the local Bedouin
population. Special attention will be given to promote on-farm and off-farm
income-generating activities, particularly among women and the rural poor. The
underlying strategy is to develop a structure within the traditional tribal system
which would serve as an effective mechanism to encourage active participation by
the local Bedouin community in the sustainable management of their natural
resource base and in alleviating rural poverty.
Ddetd Project Decriptoio
3.2      The Matruh Resource Management Project (MRMP) is designed to assist the
population in the project area in making the best use of the limited natural
resources available to them. The main components would include:
(a) Water Hrvestng aud Watehed           1t (ae  cos US$ 8.0 mN*)
3.3    To improve and sustain agricultural production within the existing agro-
ecosystems, the project will introduce several environmentally sound water
harvesting interventions to make efficient use of the available rainfall.



- 15 -
f Page 15 of 30
3.4     The project would provide for the following water harvesting works: (a)
construction of a total of about 800 underground cisterns and reservoirs with an
average storage capacity of 300 m3 each for storage of surface water run-off.
These cisterns would be used for providing water for supplementary irrigation for
existing orchards, irrigation of new orchards, watering livestock and drip
irrigation of "protected agriculture".3 Underground concrete reservoirs would be
constructed in locations where soil conditions do not permit the digging of
cisterns; (b) construction of small earth and stone dikes, laid along the
contours, to slow down and more fully utilize the surface runoff for improved
yields on existing cereal farms, fodder tree cultivation, shelter belt trees and
erosion control. Earth dikes would be constructed on about 5,000 feddans of
arable land with gentle gradients, while stone dikes would be constructed on about
1,200 feddans of arable lands having steeper gradients; (c) construction of small
cemented dikes across wadis to retard flood flows, thus reducing erosion and
creating, through sedimentation, new potentially fertile lands for orchard
establishment on about 500 feddans. The project would provide grant financing for
the establishment of such environmental infrastructure. These works would be
constructed on farmer's land in the traditional way by utilizing family labor with
the assistance of small local contractors engaged directly by the farmer. The
farmer will be assisted by a grant of 40 percent of total cost of these works from
the IDA Credit. Maintenance and upkeep of these works would be ensured by the
owner farmers.
3.5     Because of the importance of protecting the watershed areas and the
drainage wadis, the project would provide for soil conservation and erosion
control on a total of about 6,000 feddans in selected areas subject to water and
wind erosion. Project interventions would include surveys of critical areas and
remedial works of a structural and vegetative nature.
3.6    The project would establish a Soil and Water Management Unit (SWMU) as
part of the Matruh Resource Management Center (MRMC) (para. 3.8). This unit will
be in charge of carrying out investigations, applied research, surveys, planning
and designs for all the water harvesting and watershed management activities under
the project. A small climatological sub-unit will be established as part of the
MRMC which would carry out the collection of the necessary meteorological data and
assist in monitoring and predicting future droughts. The unit and sub-unit would
be supported by adequate staff, technical assistance, short term-training,
vehicles, equipment and materials.
(b) Rangeland and Grazing Man     t (Base cost US$1.8 millon)
3.7    The rangelands and other grazing areas in the project area are under
increasing pressure from both livestock and humans. Continuous uncontrolled use
for grazing, firewood and marginal barley and wheat production would lead to
further deterioration. The project would support the planting of trees and shrubs
on 12,000 feddans of communal lands and in windbreaks, as well as over-seeding
some 2,000 feddans of deteriorated pasture land with medics (Medicaao, spp.) and
grasses. The areas to be planted or re-seeded will be determined in consultation
with the rural communities. The execution of this program will be contracted out
to private entities in collaboration with the resident Bedouin population.
Provision would be made for the establishment of small nurseries. The project
X/ Intensive agriculture (mostly high value agricultural crops) drip

would address rangeland improvement in the more densely populated areas, where
land use and ownership are defined, through the research and extension component.
(c) Adaptive Research (Base cost US$3.3 million)
3.8     To respond to the urgent need for developing a local capacity for testing
and generating agriculture technology suited to ar±d and semi-arid conditions, the
project would finance the construction of new research facilities, the Matruh
Resourcs e Management Center (MRMC), at a SO-feddan site some 10 km West of Marsa
Matruh. At the same site, an agricultural training center, with dormitories for
about 30 trainees, will also be built under the project. The small ARC sub-
station at El Qasr would continue to serve as seed production/introduction garden
and site for screening trials. The training center, operated by MRMC, would
benefit staff from all institutions involved with the project.
3.9     The MRMC would develop, test and disseminate relevant technologies
designed to conserve the area's fragile natural resources, improve and sustain
rural productivity and enhance farmer's incomes. This demand-driven, adaptive
research would deal with range management and improvement, fodder plant
establishment, animal (small ruminants and non-ruminants) husbandry, cereal
(barley), fruit tree (figs, olives, and other promising species) and vegetable
production. Areas of particular concern and first priority would be: soil and
water conservation; rangeland management; intensification of crop production,
including fruit trees, fodder plants and "protected agriculture"; efficient crop-
water use; and integrated pest management (IPM). The rangeland research component
is to build upon the existing botanical and ecological knowledge of the local
population, develop applicable packages for range improvement and introduce these
packages to the extension service. Research, particularly at the subregional
level, would be intimately linked with extension activities through on-farm
demonstrations and trials, and through training of extension staff and agents.
3.10       FUnding is provided for office and laboratory facilities, furniture and
equipment; library materials, books and subscriptions; field equipment and
vehicles; rental of about 40 feddans of experimental fields throughout the project
area; and for 5 research positions, plus administrative and support staff. Local
and overseas training (both short- and long-term, including funds for exchange
visits and for attending professional meetings) and 59 staffmonths (s/m) of
international recruited technical assistance have also been provided. The latter
would, inter alia, include consultancies in: range management and improvement (17
s/m); agronomy (11 a/m); farming systems research (8 s/m); miscellaneous short-
term consultancies (S s/m); and 18 s/m for an international advisory panel on
dryland farming research.
3.11    It is anticipated that MRMC would become actively involved in national
research for dryland areas and contribute to satisfying the needs of national
training. The center would develop and maintain close links with national,
regional and international research programs, such as those of Desert Research
Institute as well as CGIAR and ACSAD. Therefore, an international advisory panel
would be set up consisting of about three to four specialists qualified in dryland
farming systems. The panel would meet annually to review achievements and to help
MRMC reassess its research program. Specifically, the panel would:
-  review MRMC's research results; assess the Center's ongoing and future
research programs; and provide information regarding relevant fields of
research abroad; and

- make recommendations on MRMC's methodology for setting priorities, and
evaluating research results, in order to provide a clearer research
focus and, based on this, advise on defining financing needs, training,
etc.
(d) Extenion and Traing (Base cost US$4.4 million)
3.12    The project would provide                Womn='s Role and Nahtue Resoume

the formulation and implementation
of the Community Action Plans.
The CEAs would receive a nominal fee for five months per year (20 days per month)
and they would receive special training under the project.
3.13    The project would fund seven subject matter specialists (SMSs) at the
Matruh headquarters and establish four Subrecional Suonort Centers (SRSCs) at Ras
El nikma, Marsa Matruh, Negeila and Sidi Barrani, respectively. Each SRSC would
be staffed by five specialist staff (monitoring and evaluation; range management
and improvement; livestock production and animal health; agronomy; female
extension) and a CoMmunity Liaison Coordinator (para. 5.7). Funding would be
provided also for technical assistance in the areas of Extension Management (4S
s/m), Women-in-Development (33 s/m), and an additional a s/m for miscellaneous,
short-term consultancies that may be required during project implementation and
staff training, and for vehicles and equipment. In addition to providing training
(both local and abroad) to project staff, the project-funded training facilities
would also be available for workshops and meetings with local producers. Major
emphasis would be on training research and extension staff on the principles of
the participatory approach, on credit management, and improved animal production
and husbandry techniques. FUnding provided for a multi-media communication unit
will comprise mobile units, extension kits and materials, video equipment, and
radio broadcasts.
3.14    The project's approach to women's concerns is to integrate them on all
levels and in each aspect of the project extension activities. Female Extension

agents would be based at each SRSC and provided with transport. Their work
programs would be coordinated by the Read of the Women in Development Department
of DES at Marsa Matruh.  Programs would deal with on-farm and off-farm activities,
such as, vegetables and small livestock (rabbits, poultry and pigeons) production.
olive pickling, fig drying, other income generating activities, and credit.
c) Rura}l mance (Base Cost US$3.8 million)
3.15    A pilot credit program would be implemented to increase income and
generate employment while enhancing the capacity of rural households to manage
risks. It would support farm investment, agro-processing, off-farm and on-farm
rural enterprises, farm services and trading which are financially viable and have
no adverse impact on the environment. Credit to establish private veterinary
offices and plant nurseries would also be provided. It would finance working
capital and fixed capital requirements.
3.16    The proposed pilot credit program is not designed as financial
intermediary lending but would operate as a special loan fund administered on
behalf of GOB by participating banks. Accounts would be opened by GOB with the
banks and' funds from the special loan fund deposited in these accounts as the need
arises. All loan collections and interest incomes would accrue to these accounts.
Participating banks would comply with project guidelines for lending and would be
paid a fee based on the volume of loans disbursed and the level of loan recovery.
To cover bank expenses for granting and supervising loans and provide an incentive
to channel loans to the small farmers, participating banks would be paid an
annualized fee of 4.5 percent of loans disbursed and an additional 1.5 percent on
amounts collected. To ensure that they bear part of the commercial risk of
lending, participating banks would share 15 percent of loan losses. Loan losses
would be based * ; arrears of more than 3 years.  The fee would be payable at the
end of each fist 1 year.
3.17    The participating banks would loan the money at their prevailing market
interest rate. Proof of possession of land, fruit trees, livestock and other farm
assets would be accepted as collateral. For those without any collateral to
offer, loans would be provided on the basis of guarantors or group liability. The
samIa" or other respected members of the tribe would be accepted as guarantors.
Loan limits would be imposed based on the nature of the enterprise being financed.
3.18    Participating banks would open a representative office composed of a male
and a female credit officer as a minimum requirement in any of the SRSCs. These
offices would be expanded as loan volumes increase. Participating banks would
assume the cost of salaries and administrative expenses of their field personnel.
3.19    A savinas Dromotion and mobilization lroaram would be devised as part of
the participatory community action planning. This process would be essential in
tailoring savings instruments in accordance with religion, culture, indigenous
practices and economic circumstances of the community members. Based on the
community designed savings scheme, participating banks would devise their savings
generation plan.
3.20    An amount of LE 9.8 million would be provided to meet the credit
requirements of the project. The total number of estimated beneficiaries is
estimated to be 3,865 rural households and enterprises. An additional amount of
La 1.4 million would, likewise, be made available to finance vehicles, equipment,
technical assistance, training and rural financial market study. Furthermore,



- 19 -                        Eqfi
, Page 19 of 30
office space at the four SRSCs would be made available to participating banks to
accommodate their field offices.
3.21    The project would provide short-term consultancy for rural finance and
marketing to train bank staff on credit analysis and savings mobilization. A
baseline rural finance study would be carried out and repeated at mid-term and
towards the end of the project. A marketing consultant would be recruited to
assist in carrying out a cooperative marketing study, and developing a market
information system.
(f) Project Management and Coordination (Base cost US$1.8 mfllion)
3.22    A Protect Coordination Unit (PCU) consisting of a Project Director
General, a deputy DG, staff for administration and finance including disbursement,
planning, M&E, procurement and supervision of construction, would be set up in
Marsa Matruh and would report directly to the National Coordinator in MALR. The
office would be equipped with computers, telecommunications, office equipment and
some vehicles. Full provision is made for incremental staff salaries, incentive
payments, operating and maintenance costs, training and short-term technical
assistance (10 s/m for training expert, 4 s/m for PRA expert, 3 s/m for
procurement). The project would provide office facilities, office equipment,
vehicles and associated operating costs.
(o Monitoring and Evaluation (Base Cost US$0.6 million)
3.23    The project would provide monitoring and evaluation (M&R) in four main
areas:
project activities in the communities;
performance of the executing agencies involved in project
implementation;
* socio-economic impact on the local population and the effectiveness of
the participatory approach;
* evolution of the natural resource base (improvement or degradation of
the vegetative cover, soil erosion, etc.) using remote sensing
techniques.
3.24    Financing would be provided for two data analysis clerks, an expert in
computer databases and management information systems, four subregional M&B
officers, and an MaR Technical Advisor. Computers, printers and supplies are also
included. Provision is made for training, annual M&E workshops and for consultant
from locally recruited institutions or NGOs, to be contracted to undertake
baseline, interim, end-of-project and ad boc studies.
4. PROJECT COST ANM) FINANCING
Cost Eseat
4.1     Total project costs, including physical and price contingencies, are
estimated at LE 124.0 million (US$ 29.5 million equivalent); the foreign exchange
component represents about 42 percent (or US$12.4 million) of total project costs.
Baseline costs are calculated using November 1992 prices prevailing in the project
area. The project would be implemented over seven years, while disbursements
would be over eight years.



- 20 -
, Page 20 of 30
4.2     The total baseline costs are estimated at approximately LE 81.4 million,
or US$23.7 million. The project focuses on natural resource management which
receives US$9.8 million (soil and water resources management, US$8.0 million, and
rangeland management, US$1.8 million), thereby accounting for almost 42 percent of
total baseline costs. Research and extension receive US$7.7 million (US$3.3
million for research and US$4.4 million for extension), or 32 percent of baseline
costs. Rural finance accounts for an additional US$ 3.8 million (including
equipment and additional staff), or around 16 percent of baseline costs. The
Project Coordination Unit (including M&E) has a cost of US$2.4 million, or about
10 percent of baseline costs.
4.3    Allowances for price increases on foreign-supplied components were
calculated using the Bank's projected MUV Index4 which averages 3.8 percent for
1993, 1.9 percent for 1994, 2.7 percent for 1995, 3.4 percent for 1996, and 3.6
percent annually thereafter. Local inflation rates were estimated at 12.3 percent
for 1993, 9.2 percent for 1994, 6.9 percent for 1995, 6.0 percent for 1996, 5.2
percent for 1997, 4.5 percent for 1998, and 4.0 percent annually thereafter.
Duties and taxes on vehicles, machinery, and equipment imported by PCU, from which
Bank/IDA supported projects are exempt, have been excluded from project costs.
The total cost estimates are summarized in Schedule A. Following project
implementation, annual incremental recurrent costs attributed to the project
(including contingencies) are estimated at US$0.92 million.
Fiancing Plan
4.4     The financing plan for project costs of US$29.5 million equivalent would
be as follows: IDA would provide a credit of SDR 1S.9 million (US$22.0 million
equivalent) or about 75 percent of total costs, on standard terms. The Bgyptian
Government would provide US$5.1 million equivalent in local currency, while the
beneficiaries would contribute around US$2.4 million equivalent. The proposed
financing plan is presented in Schedule A.
Procurement
(see Note 1)
Disbursement
4.S    The proposed IDA Credit of SDR 1S.9 million (US$22.0 million equivalent)
would be disbursed over eight years. This profile is considered realistic in view
of the experience in the area with implementation of similar works. Project
completion is expected by June 30, 2001 and Credit Closing date by December 31,
2001. Disbursement would be made in accordance with Guidelines for Withdrawal of
Proceeds of IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (November 1985), and as shown in Schedule
B.
Accounts and Audi
4.6     Spec  Aeount. To facilitate project implementation and disbursements, a
special Account would be opened by the project authority at a bank acceptable to
IDA; nDA would make an initial deposit of US$600,000, which is expected to finance
IDA's share of eligible expenditures for four months. The account would be
j/ Manufacturing Unit Value index.

Page 21 of 30
operated on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. It would be denominated in
U.S. Dollars and replenished against withdrawal applications aggregating at least
U8$100,000 equivalent.  IDA may, in appropriate cases, accept withdrawal
applications in excess of US$50,000 for direct payment. All disbursements under
the project would be made against standard documentation, except for contracts not
exceeding US$100,000 equivalent, which would be paid under Statements of
Expenditures (SOEs).
4.7     The PCU would maintain separate records and accounts in a readily
identifiable form for project activities reflecting all expenditures. In
addition, the local participating banks' branches would maintain separate accounts
for individual loans made to beneficiaries under the project. Project accounts
will be consolidated by the PCU to reflect, in accordance with sound accounting
practices, the operations, resources and expenditures related to the project.
4.8     As in the case of other IDA/Bank-financed projects in Egypt, project
accounts would be audited annually by the Central Audit Organization (CAO). CAO's
audit procedures and reports have been found to be satisfactory. CAO would also
audit the Special Account and SOEs, and would provide statements showing that
expenditures financed through the Special Account and SOEs were used for the
purpose for which they were provided. The PCU would provide IDA with a certified
copy of the audited accounts, together with the CAD' a report and -or -ents, not
later than nine months following the close of each fiscal year e -- t June 30.
S. PROCT ORGANZTION ANDMPLENTATION
Proposed Implemeon Systm
5.1    The project would adopt an innovative approach to identifying priorities
for development and efficient use of natural resources in the project area. The
proposed approach for project interface with the communities is a result of
thorough interviews with tribal leaders and community members using Particat=
Rural Assessment (PRA)s during project preparation. This would harness existing
group solidarity for implementation and acceptance of project activities. It
would also help mitigate the mutual lack of trust between local tribal population
and government agencies. The focus of the proposed mechanism and the means to
achieve better use of resources, both physical and institutional, would be the
Community Action Plas (CAPs) designed and executed by the local QnMitv Groups
(CQGs) with the support of project staff. By using small, socially coherent and
manageable planning units to carry out the analysis of the natural resource base
and assessment of the sustainable development possibilities, realistic development
plans would be outlined and community-based investment programs implemented. This
would facilitate the management of technical services in the area where the widely
scattered population and special problems require innovative practices.
The existing tribal structure and local agencies would form the basis for project
implementation. While some additional staff would need to be recruited, in most
cases the staff required are already in place or posts have been established but
not yet filled. The implementation of the new program would depend on the
reorganization of existing MALR services (ARC, ODA, DVS) in Matruh, and more
effective deployment of staff, their training, and the introduction of a new
system rather than a major build up in numbers or introduction of new
institutions.

of the PCUT is temporary and by the end of the implementation period, the interface
between the local communities and the implementing agencies would be strong enough
to eliminate the PCU.
5.3    A National Coordination Committee (NCC) would be established to facilitate
decision-making and implementation at the national level. A National Coordinator
would provide MALR's support to the PCU by giving policy clearance, international
linkage, administrative backstopping and a supportive role in project planning and
implementation through the regional MALR offices: GDA, DVS, ARC, and participating
banks. NCC would consist of representatives of the MALR (chairperson: National
Coordinator), the Ministry of Planning, the Ministry of International Cooperation,
Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA), the General Manager of PBDAC, the
Secretary General of Matruh Governorate and, where appropriate, representatives of
bi/multi-lateral projects being executed in the project area, and the Project
Director General. The NCC would meet at least once a year or as often as
necessary.
S.4     A Proiect Coordination Committee (PCC) would be established in the
Governorate and would include the Project Director General (chairperson) and
rep- ntatives of the project's executing agencies, Matruh Governorate's
Execu ..ve Council, MDRS, SRSC's Chief and elected representative of the
participating communities. PCC would coordinate project implementation among the
participating executing agencies, review and approve annual work program with
budgetary allocations. It would also facilitate cooperation between the project
and other government agencies, local communities and other development agencies in
the project area. PCC would initially meet once a month and subsequently once a
quarter.
Agriultural Serices
S.5    Matruh Resource Manacement Center (MRMC).  This Center, to be established
by the project near Mar   Matruh, would be based on the strengthening of the



- 23 -
, Page 23 of 30
existing Agricultural Research station. It would be responsible for all adaptive
research required in the fields of range management, animal husbandry,
horticulture, agronomy, soil and water management and climatology. The Soil and
Water Management Unit (SWMU) would be responsible for all investigations, surveys,
research, development and design of water harvesting works and of watershed
management works to be implemented under the project. The MMU*C will be headed by
a Director, assisted by a deputy, in addition to four professional staff for the
applied agricultural research programs and five professional staff responsible for
the activities of SWMU. The Center would also be responsible for the operation
(in coordination with the Director of Extension Services) and maintenance of the
agricultural training center built under the project (para. 3.8). The core staff
would be supported by technical and support staff.
5.6    Department of Extension Services (DES). This Department would be based on
the strengthening of the existing extension service under the QDA. The DES would
be headed by a Director who shall be an experienced agricultural extension
specialist and will be supported by eight professional staff at central level
including a Training Coordinator, Multi-Media specialist, Animal Production
Speciallist, Range Management Specialist, Horticulturist, Animal Health Specialist
(from DVS), Agronomist, and a Female Extension Coordinator. DES would coordinate
the activities, provide back-up support to, and supervise the work programs of,
the extension officers at the four SRSCs.
S.7    Subracrional Suppo,rt Centers (SRSC).  Four SRSC's would be established in
the project area, at Ras E1 Hikma, Marsa Matruh, Negeila and Sidi Barrani. Each
SRSC would be headed by a Director responsible for coordinating Conmmunit, Action
Pl"n (CAPs) and for overall administration of the activities of the center. Each
of the four centers would be staffed by Subject Matter Specialists (SMSs) in field
crops, horticulture, livestock, range management, rural women extension
specialist, a Community Liaison Coordinator, and a representative from MBDAC or
other Banks engaged in agricultural credit. In addition, each SRSC would include
a soil and water resources management office consisting of a water harvesting
specialist, a watershed management specialist and a technician. At the technical
level, each of the disciplines would coordinate its activities with its
corresponding parent organization at headquarters level in Marsa Matruh (MRMC,
DES, DVS, Banks etc).
5.8     The SRSCs would be responsible for carrying out the project's objectives
at the subregional level, assisting local communities in formulating and
implementing their CAPs. This would be achieved by establishing a dialogue with
the tribal communities through the CGs, CEAs and the Community Liaison Coordinator
(CLC), in addition to the contacts of the various project officers. The CLCs
would be social scientists (BA level) who would assist the PCU and SMSs in
developing contacts and work programs with the local communities. Through
frequent visits and surveys carried out by the center's staff, the SRSC would
provide the necessary framework for the participatory approach in developing CAPs.
5.9     The SRSC is a key organization in project implementation and would provide
a forum for ideas and requirements of the local communities which, after
discussion and scientific analysis, would form the basis for CAPs, and hence, for
the adaptive research and extension programs in support thereof.
5.10 Cammunitv Groups (CGs). Approximately 40 tribal CGs in the project area
would receive suppoi  (credit, extension, training, etc.) from the four SRSCs.
These centers, as well as the MRMC, woild provide the necessary links with
government support services and local communities.

Rural Finance Arangements
5.13    A special loan fund would be established by the GOE from the proceeds of
the IDA credit.  PCU would administer the fund under guidelines established by the
project satisfactory to IDA.  Participation in the project would be open to any
bank branches in the Governorate. Credit project agreements would be signed by
each participating bank. This agreement would specify the guidelines for lending,
the fee to be received, risk sharing arrangements and reporting requirements. The
operation of the special loan fund and the implementation of credit project
agreements would be reviewed during the interim evaluations for possible changes
which may be required during implementation.
Monitoring and Evaluation
5.14    The responsibility for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) would rest with the
M&E unit under PCU, headed by the Project Planning Officer who would receive
overseas training.

5.1S    Reportg and Anual Reviews. Project progress reporting would take place
semi-annually. Each implementing agency would submit semi-annual reports to the
PCV promptly within four weeks of the end of the period. A consolidated semi-
annual report would be submitted by the Project Director to the PCC and to IDA.
For the purposes of project and government budgeting and resource allocation, an
annual work plan, based on the completed Community Action Plans and Subregional
Work plans, would be prepared by the Project Director General assisted by the
Project Planning Officer, and submitted to PCC and NCC. Once cleared, it would be
forwarded to IDA. Project progress would be reviewed semi-annually by the PCC,
and by IDA as 'art of its regular review missions.
S.16       Beeficiam   Contacs Mouitorng. The project M&E system should be
considered as a management tool primarily for the PCU but also for the central
government. The M&E system would, in particular, stress the need to establish key
indicators to measure effectiveness of the project in responding to community
needs. Involvement of CGs in the M&E activities would help to determine if and
how project activities are reaching the target population, respond to community
needs, and to make timely adjustments.
S.17    Special diagnostic studies would provide empirical information which the
PCU, the PCC, or the SRSC may identify as necessary to solve problems, including
those identified with the assistance of the project monitoring system. The PCU
would commission diagnostic studies from local consultants or institutions/NGOs.
5.18    Evaluation of Effects and Impact. The project would adopt a pragmatic approach
to evaluating project's success in achieving the objectives of: (i) alleviating
poverty by raising incomes through agricultural and off-farm activities;
(ii) reducing the negative impacts of droughts that regularly occur in the project
area; and (iii) supporting and encouraging sustainable development in the project
area. This would be done through case studies, as a complement to the beneficiary
contact monitoring system. A social survey would be conducted as part of the
Participatory Rural Needs Assessment. This would serve as a baseline survey. The
same questionnaire would also be administered to a sample of CGs not covered by
the initial community planning in order to establish the database for testing the
impact of the community planning program. The baseline survey would be conducted
by a specially contracted local institution/NGOs or consultants and it would be
repeated prior to the end-of-project evaluation. To complement these evaluation
activities in the project area, remote sensing and satellite imagery would be
used. The project would benefit from Land Use Planning and Environmental
Monitoring developed by the El Qasr project (para. 2.47). Such a tool will permit
the close monitoring of the project's impact on the natural resources and help in
focusing future interventions. The M&B Technical Advisor (para. 3.24) would
assist the Project Planning Officer with preparing terms of reference and
commissioning these studies.
s.19   Interhn Evaluation and Reviews and Endof-Project Evaluation. Two interim
evaluations would be organized: the first after the project has been operating for
three years; the second after it has been operating for five years. Using the
specially contracted interim survey and case studies as an input, the project
would be reviewed, in cooperation with MALR, by representatives from IDA, the
Governorate and the Project Manager. Because one of the major objectives of the
project is sustainable use of the natural resources, the interim evaluation
missions would include a natural resource specialist. The results would be used
to review the targets, structure and implementation methods adopted during the
period under review and to make any necessary adjustments. The end-of-project
evaluation would cover project performance, output, effects and impact, and

economic and financial efficiency. The effects and impact of the project in terms
of beneficiary access to services and decision-making, income, and nutrition would
be assessed through the beneficiary contact surveys, the end-of-project survey,
and case studies. Section II of the Project Completion Report would be prepared
by PCU and submitted to IDA not later than six months after the credit closing
date.
Supervision Plan
5.20    World Bank Review Missions would normally be conducted in May and November
of each year. A tentative supervision plan provides for 19 review missions over
the life of the project, including interim reviews, requiring an estimated 134
staff weeks. Because of the nature of the project, a minimum supervision time of
14-18 staff weeks a year would be required during the first 3 years of the
project. A project launch mission is planned for the second half of 1993. To
expedite project start-up, the mission would review the status of effectiveness
and other legal conditions and proposals for credit disbursements.

participatory planning approach, the
priorities set for the delivery of technical support and credit, and the design of
the monitoring and evaluation system are all specifically geared to ensure the
efficient delivery of project benefits to the poor. The project would
significantly increase the farm income of about 61,000 Bedouins. The total number
of project beneficiaries, which would include indirect beneficiaries, linked to
the protection of the natural resource base would be by far greater but is
difficult to quantify precisely. At full development, the project would have a



^ 27 -
TECHNICAL ANNE
Page 27 of 30
major impact on farm income, particularly of small farmers. It is estimated that
farm income per household for small farmers (target group) would double (from
LE 1,970 to LE 4,090). Moreover, farm income for medium and large farms would
rise by about 77 percent and 67 percent (from LE 4,720 to LE 8,380, and from LE
14,030 to LB 23,380, respectively). On that basis, when the non-farm income is
included, total annual per capita incomes of project beneficiaries would be higher
than the poverty line. Analysis carried out by the mission indicates that
financial rates of return (FPR) (taking droughts into account) for the three farm
models exceed 20 percent and, therefore, would provide adequate incentives to
farmers to adopt proposed technical packages. Other financially attractive
activities are: protected agriculture (FRR - 21 percent); grain milling (19
percent); weaving blankets and rugs (19 percent); and olive pickling (25 percent).
In addition to the benefits which would be obtained directly on small farms,
project support for new off-farm enterprises would supply needed inputs, generate
employment (over 1,400 new employment opportunities) and add value to the
agricultural output of the area and thereby stimulate the local economy and create
new opportunities for poor people living in the area. Perhaps equally important,
the emphasis on water harvesting and off-farm activities wQuld help stabilize
income and thus minimize the effects of 'bad years'. The project would therefore
contribute to the reduction of rural exodus toward the Nile Valley and the Delta.
6.3     Agriculrl Producton. Although the main project benefits would be
environmental in nature, the project would have a positive impact on overall
agricultural productivity. The productivity levels to be achieved by different
crops in the project area aze presented in Table 6.1 below. It is estimated that
the incremental annual production at full development, which can be attributed to
the project, would be as follows: nearly 4,370 tons of barley, 9,566 tons of figs,
2,260 tons of olives, and 1,070 tons of field vegetables. It is also estimated
that rangeland productivity would increase by an equivalent of 500,000 fodder
units6 annually. This increased fodder availability would initially be used to
reduce the pressure on rangelands and, subsequently, to improve animal
productivity with an expected 10 percent increase in output of slaughter animals.

6.4        WoMen. In the project design, particular attention has been given to
ensuring that women are actively involved in the project and derive positive
benefits from it. By the end of the project, women in about 6,000 families would
have benefited from extension efforts and from credit assistance under the
project. In addition to the increased income derived from their own enterprises
and those of their family members, they would benefit from the potential for
improved nutrition and health for the entire family. Also, institutional and
social benefits would accrue from the establishment of a technical support service
for women, improved access of women to institutional credit, and promotion of the
active involvement of women in the planning and implementation of programs for the
development of the communities they belong to.
6.5    TradItiona Systms and Values. An important principle underlying the design
of the project has been to ensure that the approach to community planning, the
selection of interventions and activities, and the delivery of services are all in
harmony with the traditional systems and values of the Bodouin society. At the
same time, it has been recognized that, as is the case for Egypt as a whole, the
Bedouin society is changing and adapting to a variety of outside influences. The
project would help the entire Bedouin community to preserve, to the extent
possible, its cultural heritage and be more confident as it faces and participates
in these changes. It will build on existing tribal mechanisms for community
action and stimulate mobilization of households into user groups to work with the
government authorities in susltainable management of natural resources.
6.6    Replkabilty. The project has been designed to be replicated in other
similar areas. The use of a small, socially based development unit should enable
the approach to be transferred elsewhere. The institutional arrangement for the
project organization is based on the existing government posts, thus making it
readily adoptable by other projects. In technical terms, the work of the MRMC is
intended to have wider applicability, also to other dryland farming areas in
Egypt; thus experience gained in cropping and livestock activities under the
project could be easily adopted in other areas in the region. However, the key to
replicability would be the introduction of the participatory planning approach.
Without this, it would be difficult to achieve elsewhere the goals set out for
this project.
Economic Analysis
6.7    The main project benefits accrue from natural resource conservation and
the prevention of further degradation of land, as well as reducing rural poverty,
and, as such, are not captured by conventional economic analysis. Also the
project would raise agricultural and livestock production and farm income.
6.8    PCOnOm  Prkics. Economic farmgate prices were calculated for tradable
commodities and inputs based on border prices as reported in the Bank' a Commodity
Price Forecasts (November 1992). For non-tradables, financial prices were assumed
to represent economic prices where markets are not regulated. Also, the financial
and economic wage rates were assumed to be equal.
6.9     During implementation, economic costs are 67 percent of project baseline
costs. Economic costs include project investment and recurrent costs, farm
investments (including orchard establishment and improvement of olive and fig
orchards), and all farm production costs. Costs and benefits of some components
difficult to quantify, such as watershed management and credit, were excluded from
the analysis. The cost of research activities was also excluded because results



- 29 -
TRCHNtCAL AM
Page 29 of 30
derived from research are difficult to quantify under such agro-climatic
conditions. Some technical packages are already available for adoption by
farmers. Also, taxes and duties were excluded from the economic analysis. A
project life of 30 years is assumed.
6.10   The analysis assumes that barley and wheat yields would fall by S-10
percent in the without-project situation on account of continuing land
degradation. Benefits include increased yields of crops such as barley, figs,
olives, and vegetables, as well as a modest expansion in the area of new and
improved orchard due to change in cropping patterns amo=g the target group of
Small farmers who adopt water harvesting techniques. Benefits from small
livestock production bave also been included.
6.11   Based on the foregoing assumptions, the calculated ERR is 12.1 percent.
Results from switching value analysis for an ERR of 10 percent which is the
Opportunity Cost of Capital (OCC) for Egypt shows it would take an 18 percent
decrease in benefits, or a 21 percent increase in costs, to reduce the ERR to the
OCC. Sensitivity analysis shows that if benefits fall or costs increase by 10
percent, the ERR would be 11 percent. If benefits fall or costs rise by 20
percent, the ERR would fall to 9.7 percent and 10.1 percent respectively. A one
year lag in benefits (e.g., as a result of a severe drought) would reduce the ERR
to 11 percent, while a two-year delay would result in an ERR of 10 percent,
equivalent to the OCC.
6.12   Widespread and high underemployment in the project area during 5-7 months
of the year implies the opportunity cost of labor is lower than the financial
remuneration. Therefore, applying shadow wage rate equal to 75 percent of the
financial wage would increase the ERR to 12.6 percent. When the costs and
benefits of selected credit activities are included (such as olive presses,
protected agriculture, weaving rugs, etc.), the ERR rises to 12.8 percent.
7. Agretments Reached
7.1    During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government on:
(i)   the establishment by June 1994 of an International Advisory Panel for
reviewing the rainfed agriculture adaptive research program; and to
advise the Minister of MALR on MRMC's annual work programs and budgets
as well as to review research achievements;
(ii)   the provision of sufficient counterpart funds in a timely manner to
cover project recurrent costs;
(iii)   the revision of LCB procedures for the project in accordance with
procedures acceptable to IDA and that the first bidding documents, for
works and goods, under this category would be submitted to IDA for
review and comments by November 1993;
(iv)   provision of grant assistance for water harvesting works and the
proposed procedures including criteria to target rural poor;
(v)   the completion of the audit of project accounts for PCU and
participating banks by CAO and the submission of certified copies of
audited accounts and auditor's report to IDA within nine months of the
close of each fiscal year;
(vi)   the timetable for the nomination of key project staff (Directors of DES
and MRMC) with qualifications and terms of reference acceptable to IDA
by December 31, 1993 and June 30, 1994 respectively, and the
establishment of PCU with rented office facilities by December 1993;

ARA REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
N&TRUH RESOURCE MANAGMENT PROJECT
COD_MUNIT PARTICIPATION
1.          The degradation of natural resources in the project area is part
of an endemic cycle of poverty, lack of viable production alternatives and
uncoordinated regional development. Household farm incomes are lower for the
local Bedouin population than for farmers along the Nile or in the Delta
region; for half of the households, the average farm income in the project
area was between one-quarter and one-half of the Egyptian GNP per capita in
1990 (LE 1,900). Access to rural finance has been limited in the past due to
the lack of lc-al banks and problems in guaranteeing collateral without title
to land. Due partly to immigration of non-Bedouins into coastal towns,
population p assure on the fragile resource base has increased.
2.          The environmental degradation in the project area includes loss of
vegetative cover due to over-grazing and fuelwood collection, poor farming
practices, salinization from galleries and loss of soil fertility. The
success of effectively addressing sustainable management of the natural
resource base in the project area depends on the mobilization of the local
population through existing popular mechanisms and revitalization of previous
resource conservation principles of the Bedouin. Given the historically low
level of government service provision in the area and the need to increase the
level of trust between government officials and the local tribal population,
it is necessary to design, implement and monitor the project through a
participatory approach. This approach would be directed at:
(a)   Povertv reduction:  improved household incomes to meet basic
domestic consumption needs and reduce the poverty-induced
over-utilization of resources in the long-run;
(b)   sensitization of project and government personnel to
Bedouin's needs and concerns;
(c)   mobilization of the local population for sustainable
management of their resources through existing mechanisms of
community action. This would involve women, who
traditionally played a major role in production, as well as
men in fora appropriate to the socio-cultural setting.
3.          The project is based on several basic modes of community
participation. First, it helps project planners better understand the local

people and their conditions. To this end, Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA), has
been applied in the development of the projects. Secondly, the project
combines the need to collect accurate information along with the promotion of
popular participation from the start. In this respect RRA has been adapted
into a Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), which has as its primary goal the
involvement of local people in the decision-making process. Thirdly, the
project will foster participation that focuses on mobilization of local people
for its planning, implementation and monitoring and that eventual empowers the
local people.
The Local Povulatlon in the Project Area
4.          Until this century the population of the Western Desert, in which
the project area is located, was populated primarily by Bedouins. There were
only a few coastal towns of importance with fishing and sea trade the main
occupations. The bulk of the population was nomadic, traveling in search of
pasture and water with their herds of sheep and goat or camels. The local
population in the Western Desert views itself as tribal in clear distinction
to the Egyptian peasants along the Nile. The local tribes refer to themselves
as Awlad Ali, a loose grouping of tribes which entered the region from Libya
in the 17th century. The tribes that were previously living in the area were
subdued and either made into vassals (Murabatin) or pushed into the Nile
Delta.
S.          Within the project area there are at present two modes of
political structure. The first is the tribal system. The second is a limited
but important involvement by the Government of Egypt. After World War II this
area was placed under military control and the local Bedouin population was
allowed to manage its own affairs for the most part. In 1962 the area became
the formal province of Matruh and government services began to be extended to
the local population. Starting in 1959 the government began a major program
to sedentarize the Bedouins.
6.          The Awlad Ali claim descent from the Bani Suylaym, one of the main
Arab tribal groups that spread with the Islamic conquest of Egypt and North
Africa in the 7th century. The legendary ancestor of the present-day Awlad
Ali is 'Aqar al-Sharif, whose sons were Ali al-Kabir (Ali the Great) and
Dhuwayb. Their sons constitute the main divisions of the Awlad Ali tribes:
Awlad Ali al-Abyad (the white) and Awlad Alie al-Ahmar (the red) from Ali
al-Kabir and al-Sanana from Dhuwayb. Over the years the number of tribes
changed as certain lines dropped out and new groups became prominent. At
present some 40 distinct tribes are recognized in the Western Desert and these
are divided into six "super"-tribes.
7.          The Bedouins were traditionally pastoral nomads who lived in
camps, varying in size from 20-50 individuals. These were invariably close
kin and usually constituted an extended family. The basic household unit in
traditional Awlad Ali society was the bayt, an extended family of 3-4
generations depth. Today, the average size of a bayt is about 11 people.

Bayt is the most important economic unit in the tribal structure. Its members
have a lively sense of solidarity. The nuclear family was not a meaningful
unit in this pastoral nomadic adaptation, although it has become more
important in the process of sedentarization. The tribe may be the residual
owner of land and water but the bayt are the owners in use.
8.          The next level in the tribal structure is the alla, a patrilineage
or clan of 5-7 generations depth. This can range between 200 to 1000 people.
The alla is a group that holds land in common as a territory (watan). Above
the alla is the qablia or tribe in a practical sense. There are some forty of
these in the Western Desert, covering both the Awlad Ali and their clients.
Above this level there is another level of "super-tribe", also called qabLila,
of which there are six main groups. All of these tribal groups belong to the
confederation called Awlad Ali either through claims of direct descent or by
clientage. Tribesmen do not automatically unite for group action above the
level of the bayt, unless there is a particular reason.
9.          Leaders are designated at each tribal level and there is a
customary law council (majlis 'urfi) at levels above the clan. This leader is
called either shaykh or umda. Because leadership is distributed through each
level, there is no absolute leader and the politic structure is based on
consensus. Traditionally, the shaykhs were not considered "rulers", nor were
they considered superior in status. A shaikhly family had to maintain their
prestige by the help and services provided to constituents. This situation
has changed to a large extent in the process of sedentarization; the economic
and political advantages of dealing with the government promoted
stratification and created shaykhly dynasties.
Resource Use and Nana&ement
10.         The Awlad Ali tribal structure as it exists is the proposed
on-the-ground system for resource management in the project area. This tribal
structure is based on a representative system in which individual tribesmen
have defined rights of access to the recognized authorities at each level of
the tribe. Land and water resources are managed primarily at the level of the
household (bayt) and the clan (alla). When problems of coordination or
specific disputes arise between households, these are resolved by a committee
(majlls) at the level of the clan. When clans have disputes, these are pushed
up to mediation at the level of the tribe (qablila). There are both local
mediatore and the formal recognized authorities (shaykh or 'aqla) who apply a
written code of customary law. Only rarely is it necessary to resolve a
problem of resource management at the level above the forty basic tribes in
the Awlad Ali confederation. There are elaborate procedures in the customary
law for resolving local disputes over land and water. An important aspect of
customary tribal law in the region is the ability to curb violence and
coordinate action without formal executing power from state.

i) Land Tenure and Land Ownershin
11.         The issue of land tenure is of major importance in any project
with a focus on environmental management. As with other resource management
issues, it is essential to have a proper understanding on traditional tenure
arrangement as these still prevail in the area. Officially, all steppe and
desert land in Egypt belongs to the government. In traditional Bedouin
practice land was communally owned. Individuals and households did not hold
formal title, as recognized by the government, to land. The government
recognizes the de facto usufruct rights of established tribal territories, but
has refused to grant any form of legal title for communal tribal ownership.
The Desert Law 124 of 1958 and Law 100 of 1969 allowed individual tribesmen to
gain title over land they cultivated according to certain criteria. Yet, it
is estimated that 881 of cultivated holdings in the governorate are still
under traditional tenure without legal title. Furthermore, Law 17 of 1969
empowere4 the government to lease or sell state land to companies or
individuals for projects considered to be in the national interest.
12.         In the past, the Bedouins did not have a need for individual
ownership of plots since the land was divided according to well-established
rules of community access. The movable property (rizlk) tends to be owned
individually and in succession, while the landed property (malik) tends to be
owned simultaneously and in common. There is no individually owned land in
the traditional Bedouin system, nor are there written deeds for land
ownership. While individual property cannot be alienated from individuals,
the joint ownership of rilzk provides for a stable right of access.
ii) Access to Water
13.         For the Bedouin water is the most basic resource and access to
water for drinking and watering animals is by definition unrestricted.
Throughout the project area, there are old cisterns dating back to the Roman
era. Many of these are still used, while others are periodically revived.
Construction of a cistern in the area generally establishes an exclusive right
of access to the water for irrigation, although small amounts of water would
be provided to others for drinking or watering an animal.
iii) Grazina Riahts
14.         There are various types of grazing land.  Some land belongs to a
specific tribal descent group and cannot be used by anyone else without the
permission of the owner group. Other land, however, is considered open range
and access to pasture in this range is unrestricted. The pattern of herding is
largely baaed on environmental conditions. In winter the herds can be taken
into the desert to take advantage of patches of pasture. In the hot and dry
summer months, however, tribal groups return to specific territories where
there are wells.

iv) Cultivation Riahts
15.         The traditional way in which "ownership" of arable land is gained
is to prepare and work the field. This is literally called "laying the hand"
(wada' al-yad) over the land. This custom fits with an Islamic precept known
as ihya' al-mawat; it is also this principle which forms the basis for the
government sedendarization policy. All Bedouin plots of arable land have
boundaries, although these may not be apparent to an outside observer. in the
traditional system, a man could use and inherit specific plots of arable land,
but this claim to ownership was both individual and joint with the descent
group. Since the mid 1960s, the majority of cultivated land has been divided
among individual members of households.
ParticiNatorv Organization of the Proiect
i) The Community Group
16.         Against the background presented above, the proposed mechanism for
interface between communities and project managers needs to be one that tribal
leaders and tribal members in the area view as viable. This would harness
existing group solidarity for implementation and acceptance of project
activities. It would also promote mutual trust between the local tribal
population and government agencies.
17.         For interface between beneficiaries and the project, a Community
Group (CG) would be formed as focal point for each sub-tribe operating in the
project area. The CG would represent all members of the sub-tribe as they are
currently subdivided into clans and extended family households. It would be
created according to existing tribal mechanisms for community action by the
sub-tribes themselves. In a practical sense, this is the existing pattern for
resource management, although it currently has no formal recognition and
remains unmobilized for economic cooperation. Each tribe has a leader and
customary law council which at present deal with the governmental
administration. The proposed tribal focal point would have the authority to
make decisions on behalf of the constituents in the corresponding tribal
divisions and would liaise between tribal members and the Project Coordination
Unit (PCU) of the project, as well as government service providers working in
coordination with project activities at sub-regional levels.
18.         Although the communities will have to define their own
arrangements for project management, certain criteria may be suggested for
successful operation. These criteria may include the following:
*     4-6 individuals would be elected by each sub-tribe as their
representatives in the CM. The project would make no conditions
regarding who may be the representatives, as long as they are
members of the tribe. A focal point for each of the specialists
in the sRSC may be identified within the CG. Since SRSCs have a
WID specialist, Coo would also have a female member for assisting

NOTE L

women to receive rural finance, technical assistance or marketing
assistance.
*     The CG would have a Leader who will represent the group in
coordinating project activities. This is likely, but not
necessarily, to be a traditional leader.
*     Each CG would plan its own schedule of meetings with a minimum of
one public forum every three months. These meetings would be open
to all :tembers of the tribe and would be announced in advance.
These meetings would be attended by SRSCs.
*     Each CG would establish a written charter, with assistance from
the project, in order to define the mutually accepted
responsibilities under the project.
-     CGs would consider taking responsibility for guaranteeing
repayment of loans under the project to members of the tribe. It
would also certify households' right to land to serve as
collateral.
*     CGs would nominate members for training in extension activities
relevant to the local population. As focal points for SRSCs,
Conummunity Groups may also wish to participate in this training.
X     Records (official documents, accounting, etc.) for each CG could
be coordinated or kept by the SRSC or PCU, depending on the
activity.
19.         One of the main responsibilities of the CG would be the
development of a Community Action Plan (CAP) with assistance from project and
government personnel. This would define the existing state of the local
resources, customary procedures for land use, water access, grazing and
overall resource management in the territory of the tribe, and the perceived
needs for development and more effective resource management. Two of these
plans would be initiated in the first year of the project through a pilot
study approach rather than begin in each sub-tribe in the project area. Each
plan would be developed through an interactive participatory process with
project personnel in the appropriate SRSC.
20.         In order to empower the CG to manage their resources effectively,
the government would formally recognize each CG. The CG would be the
responsible legal authority for issues relating to conservation and management
of natural resources in its territory. It would be empowered to deal with
local resource management decisions defined in the CAP in order to ensure
sustainable use of these resources. There would be no government official
assigned to the CG, nor would it be subject to regulations determined for
government agencies. However, it would function as a formal user-group
vis-a-vis the project and government agencies. Any problems relating to CG

1.          The following list of indicators is provided as a guideline for
the detailed design of the monitoring and evaluation system for the Matruh
Resource Management Project. The list is not intended to be comprehensive nor
to be strictly adhered to. Rather it should be modified by the participants
in the initial project Monitoring and Evaluation Workshop, and subsequently
adapted on the basis of in-field experience with its use.
A. INPUT INDICATORS
2.          Each implementing agency, including the participating banks, would
provide quarterly data on both targets and achievements for the following:
-   Level of Funds:  budgeted and spent.
-  Numbers of Staff:  by grade and category, distinguishing
numbers of males and females.
-   Staff Training:  numbers of activities, by category; numbers
of participants in each category of activity, distinguishing
numbers of males and females, and whether training is in-
country or overseas.
-  Buildings:  numbers and progress of construction.
-  Equipment:  quantities purchased and quantities in place.
-  Vehicles:  numbers purchased; numbers on the road,
distinguishing between those allocated to male and female

B. OUTPUT INDICATORS
Disaoareaation of Outnut Indicators
3.          Output indicators for all components would be reported by
district. They would be disaggregated as follows:
-  by whether outputs are for Cos already included in the
community planning process, or for CGs not yet included in
this process;
-  by numbers of male and female participants/beneficiaries;
-  by numbers of participants from each sub-tribe.

C. BENEFICIARY CONTACT MONITORING
16.         An annual survey on a sample of approximately 50 households per
community will be conducted by the Project Planning Officer, the Community
Liaison Coordinator, and the Female Extension Officer to determine who has had
access to project outputs. In order to select the sample the social survey
completed as part of the Participatory Rural Needs Assessment will be used to
stratify households according to the area of land operated, number of
livestock owned, and sub-tribe membership. The list of topics given below
should be modified to include questions on participation in specific
activities and adoption of recommendations being promoted through the
project's research, extension and training programs (e.g. specific crop or
livestock husbandry measures or new agro-processing enterprises). The survey
should be designed to use primarily yes/no questions for ease of completion
and tabulation. Qualitative information to determine project effects and
impact will be obtained through the participatory diagnostic studies and case
studies.

ATRUH RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT
PROCUREMEN  PROBE=UE
1.         The project elements and their estimated costs and the procurement
arrangements for the components to be financed by IDA are summarized in Schedule
B. Recurrent and other local costs financed by the Government are shown under
N.I.F. (non-IDA-financed).
2.         All equipment, materials and vehicles to be financed out of the IDA
credit would be procured in accordance with the Guidelines "Procurement under IBRD
loans and IDA Credits" (May 1992). Egyptian manufacturers competing under
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) would receive a preference in bid
evaluation of 15 percent of the CIF price, or the prevailing custom duty
applicable to non-exempt importers, whichever is less, provided they can prove
that the manufacturing cost of such goods includes a value added in Egypt equal to
at least 20 percent of the ex-factory price of such goods.
3.      All bidding packages for goods estimated to cost the equivalent of
US$100,000 or more and for works US$250,000 or more would be subject to prior IDA
review of procurement documentation; other contracts would be subject to selective
ex-post review after contract award. These limits would result in the prior
review of over 80 percent of total IDA financing for goods and works. Schedule B
of the Memorandum and Recommendation of the President gives a breakdown of project
components to be procured by ICB, LCB, other and non-IDA financed procedures.  The
bi-annual progress reports to be submitted by PCU would include details on
procurement matters, showing the date and value of any new contract awards,
changes in the scope and value of contracts under implementation, any changes in
contract value and cost overruns, and a brief summary of forthcoming tenders.
4.         Eqipment, Materia  and Vehides. ICB procedures would be used for
procurement of packages with a value of above US$250,000. Project vehicles
together with equipment and materials for the Soil and Water Management Unit would
be grouped into four packages costing between US$500,000 and US$2,000,000 and
would be procured using ICB procedures. Equipment and furniture for extension,
research and the PCU and operation of rural finance will be procured in three
packages costing not more than US$250,000 each using LCB procedures acceptable to
IDA. Vehicles and equipment for start-up activities shall be procured by local
shopping procedures, based on at least three price quotations in accordance to IDA
Guidelines, with an aggregate amount not exceeding US$150,000. For Spare parts
and items of a proprietary nature or where compatibility with existing equipment
is required, direct contracting will be applied in an aggregate amount up to a
maximum of US$150,000.
S.         International shopping based on at least three price quotations and
from at least two countries would be used for items of small value, not exceeding
US$30,000 with an aggregate limit not exceeding US$100,000.  Small    items of
goods or works costing less than US$30,000 may be procured using prudent local
shopping procedures based on at least three price quotations, with an aggregate
amount not exceeding US$100,000.

6.            Civil Works (Buildings). These works are estimated to cost less than
the equivalent of US$800,000 in total and involve small buildings and associated
civil works, which are geographically dispersed and are therefore not suitable for
ICB and would be procured through three LCD contracts.
7.         LCB procedures for procurement of works and goods are generally
consistent with the IDA Guidelines. There are, however, a few procedures
inconsistent with IDA Guidelines and, as in previous loan/credit agreements, the
Government will revise its LCB procedures for the proposed project in accordance
with procedures acceptable to IDA. Also, the first bidding documents under this
category would be submitted to IDA for review and comments.
8.         Watershed      gnt. These include a combination of civil works and
agricultural works with a total value of US$1.30 million. These will be small and
scattered works and implemented throughout the project implementation period, with
80 percent procured under three LCB contracts costing between US$50,000 and
US$500,000 each. For the remainder of the works, direct contracting may be used
with local communities or by force account works implemented through the public
sector organizations in Matruh Governorate, according to procedures to be agreed
with IDA. These works would be in small parcels not exceeding US$50,000 each,
with an aggregate amount not exceeding US$250,000.
9.         Water Harvesting Works. These will be constructed mainly on the farmers'
land, costing on average not more than US$3,500 per farm. They would be
implemented by the farmers in the traditional way using grant assistance,
equivalent to 40 percent of the total cost of works, from the IDA Credit up to a
total amount of US$1.61 million according to procedures to be agreed with IDA.
These procedures would be agreed in outline during negotiations and in detail
during implementation.
10.        Rag Development. This involves the planting of fodder trees and
shrubs on communal lands and of windbreaks, for a total amount of US$2.24 million,
implemented in small scattered parcels on about 14,000 feddans. Procurement will
be by three LCB contracts covering about 80 percent of the area, with the
remainder being carried out through direct contracting procedures similar to those
indicated above for watershed management to be agreed with IDA, with an aggregate
amount not exceeding US$350,000.
11.        Consultants. The surveys and studies shall be implemented in small
packages costing between US$30,000 and $300,000 with an aggregate total cost of
about US$1,000,000.  IDA financed consultants would be recruited according to the
World Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August 1981). All documents
will be subject to IDA's prior review for contracts exceeding US$100,000 per
contract, for standard documents used repeatedly and for terms of reference of
consultants and technical assistance staff. Prior review will also be required

NOTE 4
Page 3 of 3
for terms of reference for all contracts, single source contracts, assignments of
a critical nature and amendments above US$100,000.
12.        Credt Financed Rural Investments. These would include small items of
equipment and machinery utilized by the farming community in its on-farm and off-
farm act4.vities and would be procured directly by the beneficiaries, who shall
receive credit for an average amount of about US$670 equivalent, up to a total
amount of US$3.44 million from the IDA Credit through MBDAC or other participating
banks and following well established procedures to be agreed with IDA.

MATRUH RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
General
1.       The main project benefits accrue from natural resource conservation
and the reduction in further degradation of land, which are not readily
captured by conventional economic analysis. The project would also raise
agricultural and animal production and increase farm income, thereby reducing
the level of poverty for small farmers and rural families in the project
area.    A project period of 30 years was assumed for analysis.
Economic Costs
2.       Incremental project costs are derived from COSTAB.  Economic costs
include project investment and recurrent costs, farm investments (including
the establishment and improvement of fig and olive orchards), and all farm
production costs. Replacement costs were included for vehicles, machinery,
equipment, and furniture. Imports of vehicles and equipment were priced on
CIF basis using the exchange rate prevailing at appraisal (LE 3.31/ 1 US$).
Civil work costs were based on prevailing values of contracts for such works
at appraisal.
3.       Annual recurrent costs represent the incremental operation and
maintenance costs of the project, including agricultural support services
(research and extension), and the PCU.
4.       The costs and benefits of certain components were not included in the
analysis because they are difficult to quantify: watershed management and
credit (in the base case scenario). The costs and benefits of selected off-
farm credit activities (grain mills, olive presses, olive pickling, weaving
rugs and blankets, protected agriculture) were included under a different
scenario. In addition, the cost of research activities were excluded for two
main reasons: (a) simple technical packages are already available for adoption
by farmers through extension activities; and (b) the uncertainty and
difficulties to quantify results derived from research under such agro-
climatic conditions. 100 percent of incremental costs of extension activities
and the PCu have been included.
Economic Benefits
5.       Benefit streams used in economic analysis are derived from crop
budgets and sheep budgets, which are aggregated for farm models prevailing in
the project area.    Three distinct farm models could be identified in the
project area: small farmers who own about 6 ha of land and 20 head of
sheep/goats; medium size farmers with about 18 ha of land and 50

head of sheep/goats; and large farmers who have about 50 ha of land and 200
heads of sheep/goats. Of over 18000 farmers in the project area, it is
assumed that the project would reach directly 6000 farm families, or around 33
percent. The number of beneficiaries expected to be reached directly by the
project, classified by category, are as follows: 3000 small farm families,
2400 medium farm families, and 600 large farm families. The target group in
the project is small farmers who benefit from grants to assist them in
developing water harvesting infrastructure (cisterns and dikes). Also, small
farmers, along with non-farm low income families, are the main beneficiaries
of the credit facility to be established under the project to finance off-farm
activities.
6.       Incremental benefits are calculated as the difference between the
value of production in the with project situation, including benefits which
accrue from the use of water harvesting techniques, and the adoption of
recommended practices; and the future without-project situation.  This
incorporates the effects of changing cropping patterns, especially for the
target group of small farmers who expand the area of new or improved figs and
olives under irrigation, as well as improved yields.
7.       For barley and wheat, yields were projected to fall by around 5-10
percent in the without project situation, due to further degradation of soils.
Supplementary irrigation and improved agricultural practices are projected to
increase yields by around 50 percent for barley, and by 90-100 percent for
figs and olives. Improved varieties and practices for figs and olives, along
with adequate irrigation, under the arid conditions of the project area, are
estimated to raise yields of figs and olives by a factor of 2.5. At the same
time, range improvement is estimated to increase the carrying capacity of
rangelands in the project area and therefore to reduce overgrazing pressures.
8.       Prices.  Constant 1992 prices were used for economic analysis.
Calculation of economic prices is given in Table 4. Also, taxes were excluded
from the analysis.
9.       Traded Commodities.  Economic prices at the farmgate for outputs and
inputs were calculated for tradables (barley, wheat, fertilizers, etc.).
Based on the Bank's Revision of Primary Commodity Price Forecasts of November
1992, import parity prices were adjusted to the farm level. For sheep, which
are exported in large qumantities to the Gulf countries, the export parity
price was used. Foliar fertilizer is imported, and hence the economic and
financial costs were considered to be equal.
10.      Non-Traded Commodities.  For commodities not traded in the
international market, or for which world prices could not be obtained
(vegetables, figs, fodder, olives, fresh milk, wool, etc.), prices were based
on financial prices prevailing in the project area. For barley and wheat
seeds, where minor subsidies may still exist (these subsidies were reported to
have been removed by Government recently), a conversion factor of 1.25 was
used.

11.      abLor.  The project area has a high degree of underemployment: due to
cultural and/or social considerations, and the seasonal nature of agriculture,
the labor market in the rural areas of the project is characterized by a high
degree of underemployment for about 5-7 months a year; also, many bedouins
find difficulty in finding and keeping jobs. Thus the opportunity cost of
bedouin farm workers is lower than the financial remuneration. Nevertheless,
and to be prudent, the analysis assumes that the economic wage is equivalent
to the financial wage. As part of sensitivity analysis, the ERR was also
calculated using a shadow wage rate for labor equivalent to 75 percent of the
financial wage.
12.      Based on the foregoing assumptions, the ERR for the base case was
calculated to be 12.1 percent (Table 3a).
Sensitivity Analysis
13.      The sensitivity of the ERR to various assumptions employed in the
analysis was tested by switching value and sensitivity analysis (Table 3b and
3c). Switching value analysis was carried out for a rate of return of 10
percent, which is assumed to represent the Opportunity Cost of Capital (OCC)
in Egypt. The analysis shows it would take an 18 percent decrease in
benefits, or a 21 percent increase in costs to reduce the ERR to the OCC of 10
percent. Sensitivity analysis reveals that if benefits fall by 10 percent, or
costs increase by 10 percent, the ERR would be around 11.0 percent. If
benefits fall by 20 percent, or costs rise by 20 percent, the ERR would fall
to 9.7 percent and 10.1 percent respectively. In the case of severe drought,
a one year lag in benefits would reduce the ERR to 11 percent, while a twc-
year delay would result in an ERR of 10 percent, equivalent to the OCC.
14.      When selected credit activities are included in analysis ( grain
mills, olive presses, olive pickling, protected agriculture, weaving rugs and
blankets), the ERR would rise to 12.8 percent. If a shadow wage rate
equivalent to 75 percent of the financial wage is used, the ERR would rise to
12.6 percent (not including credit).
