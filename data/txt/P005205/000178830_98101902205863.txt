REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO IRAN FOR THE TEHRAN URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Iran for the equivalent of US$42 million to help finance the cost of an
urban transport project in Tehran. The loan would have a term of 15 years,
including four years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
Most of the proceeds of the loan would be relent to the City of Tehran and
a part to the United Bus Company (UBC) on the same terms and conditions as
the proposed Bank loan; the Government will bear the exchange risk.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Iran" (R71-129) was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 1, 1971.
An updating Memorandum (R73-74) was circulated to the Executive Directors on
March 26, 1973. The next economic mission is expected to visit Iran in
September 1973. A Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        Over the past decade, Iran has given strong emphasis to the estab-
lishment of a diversified industrial base, the introduction of new institu-
tional and on-farm development practices in agriculture, the creation of
urban centers and the application of modern technology in capital formation
and distribution. Iran's achievements in these areas have succeeded in bring-
ing about a fundamental transformation of the whole production complex.
4.        The structural change was accompanied by rapid and sustained econom-
ic growth. Real GNP has doubled in the course of seven years and continued
high growth can realistically be projected. The development process, sustained
by fast growing oil revenues (which increased to an estimated $2.5 billion in
1972), has affected all sectors. Ambitious public and private investment
programs in construction, water and power, transport and communications, as
well as considerable diversification and expansion of the industrial sector,
have not only generated uninterrupted growth, but have also changed the social
and economic profile of Iran. In the process, a number of structural problems
associated with rapid growth and technological progress have arisen. These
are elaborated below and their effects on some of the major socio-economic
indicators are being monitored by the Government with a view to introducing
such adjustments as may be necessary.
5.        Rapid economic growth in Iran has been achieved at a high foreign
exchange cost. While GNP has been rising at around 11 percent per annum,
imports grew at 19 percent annually during 1963-71. This is mainly owing to
the high import content of investment and production, primarily in industry.
In order to meet the rising import bill, Iran pursued a policy not only of
maintaining low foreign reserves but also of taking advantage of its enhanced
creditworthiness to borrow abroad on a large scale. Until 1970, its foreign
reserves represented a few weeks' imports, resulting in short-term exchange
crises of varying degrees of severity. However, following the new oil agree-
ments in 1971, Iran has been able to build up higher levels of foreign reserves,



- 2 -
and in March 1973 these amounted to $1,167 million, or over four months' imports
at the 1972 level. Nevertheless, since imports are expected to continue to grow,
the Government is watching the foreign exchange situation closely notwithstand-
ing the 16-17 percent projected annual growth of oil revenues.
6.        In the Fourth Plan and, to a larger extent, in the Fifth Plan (1973-
77) greater emphasis is being given to the processing and production of domes-
tic inputs and capital goods, as well as to more effective industrial linkage
policies. The Government already has under way a number of major projects to
substitute iuported intermediate and capital goods (e.g. steel, machine tools,
engineering .nd agricultural machinery and chemicals) and the private sector
is also embarking on a number of industrial ventures of this type.    These
projects can be economically integrated with the user industries if their
output is priced competitively. The Government's role in adjusting the pro-
tection system and in helping to establish the necessary industrial infra-
structure is crucial in inducing further industrial growth. These problems
were highlighted in the Bank report on "Iran, Industrial Policies and Prior-
ities" (R72-76) and are the subject of a continuing dialogue with the Iranian
authorities.
7.        Continued adjustment of industrial development policies, however,
while necessary, is not sufficient. Industries need markets, either within
the country or abroad, and the domestic market for intermediate and capital
goods depends to a great extent on the market for domestically produced con-
sumer goods. This market has largely been made up of the urban population,
whose demands are unlikely to increase at the rates experienced during the
1960's. Since the development of foreign sales of modern manufactures is
still in its infancy, the continued rapid expansion of sales of consumer
goods (and of the entire economy) requires an increase in the real incomes
of the poorer urban dwellers and the 18 million people still living in the
rural areas.
8.        The dynamic growth of industry in recent years, contrasted with low
rates of growth in agriculture, has created an imbalance as the income gap
between Iran's urban and rural population widened. Because of this, the Gov-
ernment has decided to give high priority to acceleration of the development
of the agricultural sector in the Fifth Plan, which calls for a four-fold
increase in the resources being allocated to that sector during the next five
years. Intensive efforts are currently under way to work out a comprehensive
strategy aimed at maximizing production through cooperatives and farm corpora-
tions as well as agri-businesses. The Fifth Plan includes projects designed
to achieve more efficient use of irrigation facilities, expansion of the agri-
cultural extension corps, and wider distribution of credit, fertilizers and
improved seeds. However, it should be recognized that given the scarcity of
irrigation water in Iran, the agricultural sector cannot provide higher in-
comes and gainful employment opportunities for all those living at present in
the rural areas (60 percent of the population), let alone for a growing rural
population. The urban drift, which has accelerated over the past decade, is,
therefore, expected to continue.



- 3-
9.        This urban drift is an important element in reducing the degree of
underemployment in the rural sector. The Government is, however, concerned
about providing new employment opportunities in both urban and rural areas.
While it is not realistic to attempt a projection of the urban employment
potential in Iran, the employment record so far has been impressive. Despite
an annual growth rate of urban population of over 5 percent during the past
decade, there are no major signs of open unemployment in the larger cities.
This observation is supported by the rising trend of wages (which, neverthe-
less, are still low and just above subsistence level for the unskilled workers)
and by the rapid expansion of employment opportunities in industry, construc-
tion, publ:ic utilities and services. Nevertheless, at the anticipated rate
of urbanization, the urban labor force would grow from some 3.7 million workers
in 1972 to 4.7 million workers in 1977. The capital cost of employing the one
million new entrants in the urban labor market plus (400,000 in rural areas)
over the next five years will be high, but the Fifth Plan calls for creation
of a total of 1.8 million new jobs, and therefore aims not only to accommodate
new entrants but also to reduce underemployment.
10.       Pressures on urban facilities (e.g. housing and mass transportation)
are increasing rapidly in major cities where development over the past decade
has tended to concentrate. Current projections indicate that continued ur-
banization at present rates would mean a two-fold expansion in the size of
the major urban centers in a decade. To face these problems, Iran is inten-
sifying its efforts to decentralize development away from Tehran to provin-
cial areas, and during the Fourth Plan industrial and other investments have
been made in several other cities such as Esfahan, Ahwaz, Shiraz, Mashhad and
Tabriz. The Government expects to pursue a similar policy during the Fifth
Plan and thereby lessen the attraction of Tehran as the major center of em-
ployment to migrants. Nevertheless, Tehran's population probably will increase
by more than 50 percent over the next decade and the Government is undertaking
investments in various urban services, including transportation, to relieve
pressures that have resulted from past rapid growth, and to meet the future
needs of the metropolis.
11.       In recent years there has been a marked increase in Iran's external
debt outstanding, which, as of March 31, 1972, amounted to $5.1 billion (of
which $2.9 billion was disbursed). Of the total debt, including the undis-
bursed amount, about 43 percent was held by governments (some 18 percent was
held by the USSR and 11 percent by the USA, the two largest creditors), and
about 10 percent by the Bank. The rest is private debt owed to foreign sup-
pliers and private financial institutions. There have been some changes in
the nature and source of loans which Iran has received in the past few years.
The most significant of these is the increase in short-term indebtedness to
financial institutions since 1969. The improved reserve position of the Cen-
tral Bank allowed the repayment of a portion of these short term loans in
1971, as well as the improvement in reserves already referred to. A long-
term projection of Iran's external position shows that a substantial gross
inflow of capital would still be required to meet the investment program of
over $36 billion envisaged in the Fifth Plan. Preliminary estimates indicate
that at least 10 percent of this investment will be financed from foreign
sources, requiring gross inflows of some $1.6 billion annually. This, how-
ever, is not likely to raise the debt service ratio beyond the present 20



- 4 -
percent during the Fifth Plan period. It is expected that the Bank's share
in total outstanding debt (excluding undisbursed) will remain at about 8 per-
cent while its share in the external debt service will increase from about
5 percent in 1973 to 6 percent in 1977. In view of the fact that diversifi-
cation of the economy and rapid economic growth are likely to continue, Iran
may be considered creditworthy for substantial borrowing on conventional terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN IRAN
12.       The Bank has made 26 loans to Iran, amounting to $872.3 million (net
of cancellations), of which $454.4 million has been disbursed and $211.7 mil-
lion repaid by the end of June 1973. Annex II contains a sumary statement
of Bank loans and IFC investments as of June 30, 1973, and some notes on
the implementation of ongoing projects.
13.       Since 1957 (when the first loan was made to Iran) until 1969, Bank
lending had been mainly for roads, irrigation and industrial credit. In the
last three years, however, as lending increased rapidly it was also greatly
diversified and now includes power, telecommunications, ports, pipelines,
agricultural credit and education.
14.       Until recently, IFC's activity was fairly moderate.    A first invest-
ment was made in 1959 in a ceramic tile plant, which was followed by a second
investment in a steel products company. Since June 1971, IFC has made four
investments in pulp and paper, carbon black manufacturing synthetic fibers
and food products. As of February 28, 1973, the IFC had invested an amount
of $24.1 million in Iran. An agreement covering the investment of $0.4 mil-
lion in the equity of a carbon black project, together with a $3.0 million
loan, was signed in March 1973. In addition an agreement for a $11.0 million
loan to a company manufacturing automobiles and buses was signed in June 1973.
15.       The Bank lending program contemplated for the next few years is
intended to support the high levels of investment and social welfare expend-
itures required if Iran is to maintain the growth rate of 10-12 percent an-
nually, which it has set as its target for the Fifth Plan covering the five
year period which commenced on March 21, 1973. While the program will pro-
vide for continued investment in infrastructure and in industry, special em-
phasis is to be given to agriculture and the social sectors in accord with
the Government's policy. It is hoped that the preparatory nutrition study
under the first Population loan will lead to a nutrition project by 1975.
Discussions with the Government are fairly well advanced on the content of
a second education project. Urbanization, water supply and sewerage proj-
ects are also being considered for Bank lending. Furthermore, the special
Task Force which has been established to work with Government agencies con-
cerned with the complex problems of agriculture and rural development is ex-
pected to develop specific plans for investment in the rural sector.

PART III - URBANIZATION IN IRAN - PRESENT SI[TUATION
2
16.       Iran has an area of 1,648,000 kmi , equivalent to the aggregate size
of the countries that comprise the Common Market, but only a quarter of this
total area is suitable for agriculture. Its total population estimated at 31
million in 1972 has grown recently at an average rate of 3 percent per annum
while urban population has increased at an annual rate of about 5 percent.
Some 40 percent of the population now lives in urban areas, and half of this
urban population is concentrated in seven large cities of over 200,000 in-
habitants.
Urban Development
17.       Iran's present 13.2 million urban population is projected to grow
by an additional 4 million during the Fifth Plan period of 1973-78 to total
17.2 million by 1978. To cope with the resulting infrastructure needs, the
Government has allocated $495 million for urban development in the Fifth
Five Year Plan compared to corresponding investments of only $130 million
in the preceding five years. About half of the urban investments are for
water supply and sewerage and drainage systems, a third for traffic and
transport systems and the remainder for other public facilities and some
urban renewal. During the same period, the population in the Tehran metro-
politan area is projected to grow from its present level of 3.8 million to
about 4.8 million. In other words, Tehran will continue to absorb about 25
percent of the net additional growth expected in Iran's cities during the
Fifth Plan. In subsequent years, however, the Government's decentraliza-
tion policy should begin to effect a slowing down of growth in Tehran.
18.   2   Tehran's population of 3.8 million is spread out over an area of
350 km . The greater Tehran region, which is some 460 km wide, spreads from
Zanjan in the west to Semnan in the east and accounts for over half of the
value added in trade and commerce in the country. The center of the city,
a zone of about 30 sq. km. extending 5 km. east-west and 6 km. north-south
contains most of the administrative, commercial and business activities. A
significant part of the commerce is located in the southern part of the cen-
ter. Until now there has been no effective land use policy or planning of
urban growth. The pressures of population and its physical development have
resulted in shortages of basic urban infrastructure and essential services
for the city. Such shortages especially affect the lower income population
which lives mainly in the south and east where a considerable portion of the
factory employment is also located. Two major pre-investment studies being
financed by the UNDP are now underway to plan the expansion of the water
supply, sewerage and drainage systems in Tehran.
19.       The transport problems of the bulk of the Tehran population have
grown worse in the last five years. Faltering public transit service is
the most obvious transportation defect resulting from rapid and unplanned
urbanization. Bus services are poor and provide only for some 2 percent
of the traffic movements into the city center. The bulk of the vehicular
transport takes place by private car. The once adequate street network is



- 6 -
also over-taxed by the .75,000 vehicles (1971 fsigure - 80 percent private
cars, and 20 percent taxis, trucks and buses) usedI in the ci.ty.  if present
zrends continue, the number of private cars in the city is expected to reach
over 400,000 in the next decade. Traffic distributlon over the day is fairly
even with prolonged peak hours.  These factors resul-t in low travelling speeds
and accentuated congestiorn in tae streets. Vehicle speed on most main roads
is estimat._ed to be below 19 km per hour and below 15 km per hour in the down-
town comrmercial a-ea. As the average car trip only trazso,orts two persons,
the addition of more car movements will only exacerbate thie situation and
cause conditions to become intolerable.
Road Network
20.      'The road Eysterm is relativeely adequate in strciure DbUt deficient
for the present 'heavy fLows of^ predominantly automobile traffic.  Poorly in-
terconnected radial roads into 'Tehran an;d an incomplete orthogonal road grid
within Tehran are major reasons for the heavy congestion in the city.   The
projected net addition of some 275,000 private cars within the next ten years
to the present level of 140,000 will, if unconstrained, undoubtedly produce
chaotic traffic conditions if not an impossible situation given thle Limited
road capaci ty.  Structural changes are necessery to comarplete the present
street network and to decongest certain areas.
Public Tra_sport
21.       The Uni'ed Bus Company of Tehran (IJBC) wholly owned by the City,
operates some 2,300 buses over 152 lines with a co-tebined route length of
1,380 km. Its operattion and finances have been poorlv maniaged, but it is the
only means of transport for about thrae cjuarters of the c-ity's popu'lation.
The number of buses in service has actually declined in recent years be-
cause of inadequate maintenance and poor scheduling.   It is estimated that
only 1,400 buses car be operated on any single day because the u*til-ization
rate has fallen fropi 89 percent to 61 percent sinrca 1965.  The number of
passengers per day has declined by some 400,000 since 1969. Overcrowding
is common in peak hours as is long waitting ti-mes which sometimes reach: over
half an hour.  It is estimaced that uo to 20 percent of the passengers do
not pay.
22.       UBC's annual operatinag losses in L 970 and 11971 were Rials 547 mil-
lion and Rials 852 rmillion respectively.  The loss for -1972 is estimated at
Rials 1,071' million.  During these three years revenues have dropped from
RILals 1,727 milllon to Rials 1,454 milli-on.  UBC's Losses have in the past
been met by unsystematic payments from the Government anid the City and by
borrowings which the UBC was in no position to repay.,
23.       The taxi service, used predomiranatly by the relatively higher income
groups, has maintained an upward trend in ridership. Taxis which follow fixed
itineraries and canl service one or more passengers, charge a set rate of Rials
5 to 10 and have increased their business. Besides, there are radio taxis with
a riinimum fare of R_ials 50, airport taxis witn minimum charge of Rials 80 and
metered taxis with a minimum c:harge o'f Rials 10.  The average bus fare on the



-7-
other hand is Rials 2.25. Over the last three years the number of service
taxis has increased by 65 percent while the bus fleet has decreased by 10
percent.
The Immediate Action Program
24.       Although earlier road loans had been concerned only with inter-urban
transport, because of the concern over deteriorating transport in the city,
a Tehran Transport Study was financed under Loan No. 697-IRN (Fifth Roads
Project) approved in June 1970. The Study., carried out by consultants SOFRETU,
recommended an Immediate Action Program covering urgently needed measures to
be taken over the five-year period 1972-76. The Immediate Action Program pro-
posed measures to improve the existing public bus transport system through
rehabilitation and renewal of the bus fleet and reorganization of the UBC's
operations, and to improve traffic circulation in the city to reduce conges-
tion. The study recommended a multifaceted approach covering physical, fi-
nancial and administrative measures which had to be implemented simultaneously
if all the benefits that were anticipated were to materialize. The essence
of the recommendations was the restoration of the public transportation sys-
tem in Tehran which required procurement of new buses, repair and rehabilita-
tion of the present bus fleet, improved operations and financial management
of UBC and rationalization of the operational methods of the bus system. In
accordance with the consultants' recommendations, the Government has decided
to adopt a general policy of favoring public transport over the alternative
of greater private car use within the city and realizes that one first step
toward solving the city's transport problems is the provision of good qual-
ity, inexpensive public transportation. The Government and UBC have already
begun taking,steps to implement the consultants' recommendations on expand-
ing the bus fleet, opening new bus depots, streamlining the labor force and
improving UBC's financial position. The consultants also made several pro-
posals on institutional aspects, mainly regarding improved coordination among
different agencies responsible for transportation and urban development in
Tehran.
Private Car Use
25.       The project proposed represents a first step towards relieving im-
mediate pressures on the city's transport system. The Government realizes
that improvement of public transport quality is only one of a series of major
measures needed and is adopting parallel measures to discourage private car
use. Measures restricting parking are of primary importance but require con-
tinuous adjustment , and take time to implement. The Government has restricted
private car use in the congested city center area by installing parking meters,
and by greatly increasing fines for parking in no parking areas and for other
traffic violations from Rials 500 to Rials 1000 ($14.60 equivalent); moreover
it is making plans to abolish free parking on the main roads over the next
several years. Duties and taxation on private cars imported into Iran
presently range between 200 and 500 percent and those on locally produced
cars about 40 percent. (Three types of cars are produced in Iran; two types
of buses are also manufactured locally, and the duty and tax levied on im-
ported buses adds. 40 percent to their c.i.f. price.)



Long Term Planning
26.       The Immediate Action Program is the first step to long-term improve-
ments for which tne consultants proposed three alternatives. Tne first provides
for better use of cars and buses by improving .he street network and improving
bus transport; the second favors mass transportation with less stress on road
improvements; the third is a mixed solution o' mass surface and underground
transportation and road improvement to ease congestion.   The merits of each
alternative have been discussed with the Bank and the Government and are now
being incorporated into the consultants' final report due in July.
27.       Tehran's long-term transport needs can only be discussed rationally
within a framework for planning future development of the Tehran urban area
as a whole.  The Government recognizes that a broader examination of devel-
opment policy alternatives is required for the Tehran metropolitan area and
that investments on large scale urban projects, including those on transport
systems, need to be coordinated within the framework of new urban strategies
and guidelines. The Fifth Plan, therefore, calls for the creation of a Tehran
Development Council (TDC) to perform such a broad, high-level planning and
policy making function. This represents a considerable step forward in meet-
ing the institutional needs for guiding the development of a large capital
city such as Tehran. The Government has requested Bank assistance to deter-
mine the organizational framework of TDC and in developing the necessary
planning and decision making capabilities that would be required of TDC after
it is established. Preliminary exchanges on the possible terms oL reference
and the scope of TDC's powers and functions took place during appraisal of
the proposed project.
28.       Following discussions with Bank staff during appraisal, and sub-
sequently with the Bank mission which visited Tehran in May, the Government
presented a bill to Parliament in early June which will establish TDC.   Ac-
cording to the provisions of the bill, the supreme body of TDC will be a
High Council consisting of the Ministers of Housing and Development, Water
and Power, Economy, Labor and Social Affairs, Agricu:Lture and Natural Re-
sources , the Minister of State in charge of the Plan and Budget Organiza-
tion and the Mayor of Tehran, under the chairmanship of the Deputy Prime
Minister for Economic Affairs. The work of TDC will be carried out by a
Secretary General to be appointed by the Prime Minister, and who will be
provided with the necessary supporting staff and facilities. The bill has
undergone a reading by the Lower House and is presently being considered
by a Joint Committee of Parliament, after which it is expected to be re-
turned to the House for a vote.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
29.       The project for which the Government of Iran has requested finan-
cing was prepared by the Government with the assistance of consultants SOFRETU
(see paragraph 24). The project was pre-appraised in December 1972 and ap-
praised in February/March 1973. Negotiations on the proposed Loan were held



-9-
in Washington during the week of June 18 with a delegation led by His Excellency
Manuchehr Agah, Undersecretary for Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance,
and consisting of representatives of the City and UBC.
Project Objectives
30.       The main objectives of the proposed project are:
(i) to assist in setting up the Tehran Development Council,
and towards formulating and integrating development plans,
including long term transport plans, on the basis of a
coordinated long term urban development strategy for the
Tehran area;
(ii) to improve the efficiency and quality of the public bus
service in Tehran to meet the urgent needs of the mass of
the population;
(i:Li) to improve traffic circulation in the heavily congested
city center; and
(iv) to carry out, as a corollary to the measures in (ii) and
(iii), supplementary feasibility studies of the long-term
transport needs of Tehran with a view to establishing an
efficient long-term public transport system, thus reducing
to the extent possible the use of private cars.
Main Features
31.       The project would consist of:
(a) improvements in public transport through the procurement
of an initial order of 250 single decker buses and 115
double decker buses and a second order which will be based
on further studies of bus fleet composition; repair and re-
habilitation of the existing fleet; construction and equip-
ment of two bus depots; assistance to the United Bus Company
in management and operations through the provision of con-
sultancy services for an Economic and Technical Advisory
Group;
(b) implementation of traffic circulation improvements, including
the introduction of a system of one-way streets, construction
of five underpasses, surface construction in two squares and
street improvements in the southern part of the city, with
the assistance of consultants to be provided to the City of
Tehran; and
(c) (i) preparation, with the assistance of consultants, of
a long-term urban and regional plan for the Tehran
area; and



- 10 -
(ii) a review, with the assistance of consultants, of
existing transport studies, and further feasibility
studies and detailed design of the long-term public
transport system for Tehran.
A loan and project summary has been included in Annex III. The Appraisal
Report (No. 158a IRN) dated July 18, 1973 is being circulated separately.
32.       The purchase of new buses and the rehabilitation of some 635 exist-
ing buses over the three year project period (together with the further re-
habilitation of 235 buses and the purchase of up to 400 additional new buses
in the two years following the project) would enable UBC to increase its car-
rying capacity by about 50 percent. With improvements in operations, fleet
utilization should increase from 61 percent in 1972 to 85 percent by 1978.
A Technical emd Economic Advisory Group to be formed in UBC will, with the
assistance of consultants, in the first place determine performance oriented
criteria against which UBC's operations could be measured, and to which Gov-
ernment subsidies could be related. Assistance in improving management and
operations will then be provided with a view to ensuring that UBC's opera-
tions achieve maximum cost effectiveness consistent with public interest in
obtaining equitably priced, efficient and convenient transportation. The
new depots would provide routine maintenance workshops and serve as pilot
areas for introduction of management decentralization schemes.
33.       Improvements in traffic circulation in the city center and the de-
velopment of a secondary street network in the southern part of the city would
facilitate smoother flows of cars and buses and increase traffic speeds. One
way street operation with coordinated signalling will be carried out on a trial
basis for part of the first year, and centralized traffic control would be in-
troduced gradually as the second and third phase of street operations are un-
dertaken. The City is already considering the introduction of priority bus
lanes on the proposed one way streets. During implementation of traffic cir-
culation improvements a study will be made of other details of traffic engineer-
ing, signalling, priority bus schemes and regulation of cars with a view to
making recommendations on the optimal measures to be adopted. During negotia-
tions assurances were obtained that the City will consult with the Bank on
implementing these study recommendations.
34.       Consultants will assist the Tehran Development Council in the de-
velopment of comprehensive short and long term urban planning policies for
the greater Tehran metropolitan area. They will focus on defining rational
economic and social guidelines within which all decisions affecting the city,
including major infrastructure investments in the Tehran region, would be un-
dertaken. Consultants services will also be provided (para 31(c)) for sup-
plementary feasibility studies of the long-term transport system for Tehran.
Cost and Financing of the Project
35.       The total project cost is estimated at $65.9 million equivalent
including contingencies, of which $42 million represents the foreign exchange
component estimated on the assumption that all equipment will be imported.



- 11 -
The portion of the proposed loan to finance bus procurement, depots and other
bus transport improvements (Part a of the project outlined in paragraph 31)
would amount to $31.1 million and would be made available to UBC, while $7.2
million covering Part b would be made available to the City; the remaining
portion of the proposed loan ($3.7 million equivalent) would be utilized by
the Government for the long term studies referred to in Parts c(i) and (ii)
above. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Government
will provide by way of grants the local currency funds to the City and UBC
for capital expenditures required for project implementation.
Procurement and Disbursement
36.       Contracts for construction and for supply of equipment (including
buses) would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding
carried out in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. A preference of up
to 15 percent or the applicable customs duties, whichever is lower, would
be applied to bids from local manufacturers o' equipment. Two types of
buses are manufactured in Iran, and local value-added is estimated to be
over 40 percent. Locally manufactured buses are believed to be competi-
tive, and local manufacturers may win some awards for supply of buses.
37.       The loan would be disbursed against the c.i.f. costs of imported
equipment, the foreign exchange costs of equipment installation and consul-
tancy services, the ex-factory costs of any contracts awarded to local manu-
facturers on the basis of international competitive bidding, and 50 percent
of the costs of civil works contracts (representing the estimated foreign
exchange component). To the extent that local manufacturers win orders
for equipment, there will be some financing of local expenditures.
Implementation
38.       The United Bus Company, which will execute Part a of the proposed
project, is wholly owned by the City and is headed by a General Assembly,
most members of which belong to the City Council and which meets annually.
UBC's management consists of a Chairman and General Manager who is assisted
by two other Managers responsible for Personnel and Administration and for
Financial Affairs. As with all publicly owned companies, an Inspector ap-
pointed by the General Assembly from the staff or from the Ministry of Fi-
nance is responsible for ensuring satisfactory financial conduct of UBC.
The management is excessively centralized. Because of management and finan-
cial difficulties (see paras 21 and 22) the consultants to the Economic and
Tehnical Advisory Group to be financed under the proposed loan would focus
on improving UBC's operations and management, including training of workers
essential to the future maintenance program. In addition to determining
operational and financial performance targets to be achieved over the proj-
ect period, it would be specifically responsible for instituting systems
analysis, method study, revision of routing and operation, recommendations
on service frequency and its financial implications, budgetary control sys-
tems, job costing procedures, fare structures and devolution responsibilities
within bus depots.



39.       The City of Tehran, which will execute Part b of the project is an
independent Government body whose chief executive, the Mayor, is appointed by
the City Council for a term of two years. The City Council consists of elected
representatives. Three of the four major departments of the City directly
involved in urban development projects are:   the Technical, City Planning,
and the Finance and Administration Departments. The section in the Technical
Department responsible for traffic planning, also determines location of park-
ing meters, bus stops, no parking zones, etc.   This is done in coordination
with the Traffic Police which is responsible for enforcement of traffic reg-
ulations. The Government has indicated that it will effect any coordination
necessary between these two agencies. During negotiations assurances were
obtained that the City will, prior to effectiveness, appoint a qualified
Traffic and Planning Manager with powers and functions satisfactory to the
Bank and with sole responsibility for implementing traffic circulation im-
provements, and tnat he will be assisted by competent staff.   The City has
also given assurances that it will appoint qualified consultants on terms
of conditions satisfactory to the Bank, to assist the Traffic and Planning
Manager in the preparation of designs for traffic circulation improvements
and supervision of their implementation. Since legislation is required to
transfer responsibiLity for installation of traffic lights from the Traffic
Police to the City, assurances were obtained that $700,000 for traffic con-
trol equipment will be on-lent to tne City contingent upon the transfer of
such powers. If such a transfer does not take place by June 30, 1974 the
Government will promptly request that the Schedules to the Loan Agreement
be amended, and will7 then implement this element of the project.
40.       For Parts c(i) and (ii) of the project, assurances were obtained
during negotiations tnat the Government or TDC shall, by a date not later
than December 31, 1973, employ qualified and experienced consultants on
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank; and promptly upon completion
of the long-term urban and regional plan and the supplementary studies of
the long-term transport system review the recommendations with the Bank and
consult with the Bank on the necessary steps for implementing the urban and
regional plan. Assurances were also obtained that the Government will adopt,
in consultation with the Bank, a long-term transport system plan on the basis
of the consultants' recommendatio-as; that the Government or TDC shall then
employ qualified and experienced engineering consultants acceptable to the
Bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank to prepare a detailed
design of the long-term transport system; and that upon their completion
these designs will be reviewed with the Bank. Since studies in some depth
have already been conducted on transport, and since the urban planning
studies are also expected to begin by the end of December 1973, the long-
term transport plan is expected to be available by about December 1974.
Bus Company Finances
41.       The financial position of UBC has been, and still is, precarious.
However, with improved management and operational procedures to be instituted
as part of the reorganization to be carried out under the project, it can be
turned into a viable institution for providing an adequate level of service
to the general public.



- 13 -
42.       In the past, because of the shortages of cash required to meet
operating expenditures, buses have not been adequately maintained. This has
resulted in a decline in the number of buses in operation, and therefore, a
decline in revenues (see para 22). The Government and the City have made
contributions to UBC as grants and through purchase of shares. However,
as these contributions were not made on a regular basis they have not helped
to ameliorate UBC's problems.
43.       Although the Balance Sheet for 1972/73 showed UBC with Rials 577
million in working capital, this is reduced to Rials 163 million after ad-
justments for obsolete parts, and bad debts. As of March 20, 1972, the
Balance Sheet showed a large accumulated deficit, and Government advances
amounting to 2,033 million Rials which UBC had no prospects to repay. Fol-
lowing the appraisal of the project, in order not to unduly burden UBC at
this initial stage of its reorganization and to ensure its future financial
viability, the Government has, as of March 20, 1973, written off all of UBC's
long-term loans and advances. It has also taken over payment of UBC's two
outstanding suppliers' notes contracted by UBC for the purchase of 400 buses
in 1972 in the context of the five-year rehabilitation program proposed by
the consultants. The write-off of debts is reflected in the opening Balance
Sheet for the current fiscal year which began on March 21, 1973. Also, in
order to have a true reflection of the balance sheet position, agreements
were reached during negotiations that the Economic and Technical Advisory
Group will complete the evaluation of UBC's assets by not later than March 20,
1974, and that for subsequent fiscal years UBC will submit to the Bank finan-
cial statements audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank within
six months after the end of the fiscal year. It was also agreed that the
Group will develop and introduce by not later than March 20, 1975, a system
of cost accounting satisfactory to the Bank. The effects of the write off
of long tterm debt and the revaluation of assets were incorporated in the
balance sheet for the year 1973 and used for the purpose of project appraisal.
44.       UBC's financing plan for investment during the period 1972-1978
shows that of the Rials 5,611 million required, the proposed Bank loan will
account for 38 percent, and other loans (required for further fleet renewal
and rehabilitation beyond the project period in accordance with the Five
Year Immediate Action Program) for 19 percent. Government contributions
are required to cover the remaining 43 percent of UBC's need for funds,
and for servicing UBC's debt over the period. The net Government contribu-
tions will cover incremental operating cash requirements, and the purchase
of land for one depot. The operating cash requirements are, however, pro-
jected to decline over the six year period. During negotiations assurances
were obtained that until March 20, 1979 UBC will not incur any long term
debt other than under the proposed project without the prior approval of
the Bank.
45.       In order to instill financial discipline, to have norms for judg-
ing UBC management's efficiency, and to determine the correct rationale for
provision of operating subsidies, the Economic and Technical Advisory Group
will prepare recommendations on operational and financial targets to be



- 14 -
achieved by UBC over the project period and in the long term. The recom-
mendations for the long-term will include appropriate financial policies
and the measures to be taken by UBC to implement such policies. The main
objective of these policies will be to ensure that UBC becomes financially
viable within the five year period of its reform. During negotiations, as-
surances were obtained that the Economic and Technical Advisory Group's rec-
ommendations on operational and financial targets will be prepared by not
later than June 30, 1974; that UBC will review these recommendations with
the Bank by not later than August 31, 1974; and that UBC will thereafter on
the basis /of this review, adopt by a date not later than December 31, 1974,
a plan of measures to be taken to improve the operations and financial posi-
tion of UBC in accordance with a timetable acceptable to the Bank and there-
after adhere to this timetable. The Government and the City (power to change
tariffs is vested in the City Council) have confirmed this assurance.
46.       In the short run, UBC has agreed to adopt a plan satisfactory to
the Bank to ensure that new buses to be financed under the loan, will be
utilized to provide new or improved services; it has also agreed that the
highest of the prevailing tariffs will be charged for services provided by
the new buses. At present, the two fares charged are two Rials and five
Rials. It is expected that new double-deckers will continue to be used on
crowded inner city routes, and that the lower tariff will be applied to these
services. Most of the single-deckers, however, are expected to be used on
routes where higher fares are being charged or on new routes at the higher
fare. As part of the financial program referred to in paragraph 45, and as
a minimum measure towards financial viability, UBC and the City have also
agreed to prepare by not later than December 31, 1974, a plan acceptable to
the Bank designed to provide for an increase of not less than 25 percent in
the annual operating revenues of UBC and to implement the plan by not later
than March 31, 1975. Moreover, the Government has agreed that until the
fiscal year commencing March 21, 1977, it will provide UBC with sufficient
funds, by way of grants, to cover the difference between UBC's operating
income and its operating expenses. The forecast financial statements of
UBC assume fare increases to result in increases in operating revenues of
25 percent each in 1975/76 and 1978/79. They also reflect increases in
fleet capacity and hence ridership. While expenses would rise from some
Rials 2.9 million in 1972/73 to Rials 3.8 million in 1978/79, revenues are
expected to rise from Rials 1.6 million to Rials 4.0 million during this
period thus putting the Company on a viable basis. In 1978/79 a Govern-
ment grant is not expected to be needed.
47.       During the period of reform UBC's debt/equity ratio, which will
be 0/100 in 1973 after the Government's write off of debt, will increase
to a maximum of 55/45 in 1977/78 after which it begins to decline. These
ratios are satisfactory. In order to ensure the future financial viabil-
ity of UBC, it was agreed during negotiations that commencing 1979/1980 no
debt may be incurred by UBC unless the preceding 12 months internal cash
generation were more than 1.25 times the maximum projected future debt
service requirements.

Project Justification
48.       The urbanized area and population of Tehran will double by the end
of 1991 while at the same time the average household income would triple and
the number of cars per thousand would, in the absence of specific measures
favoring public transport, quadruple. Miovements of people in the city are
expected to increase from 5.5 million trips per day in 1971 to 17.2 million
trips per day in 1991.
49.       The proposed project aims at establishing the institutional and
planning framework for determining long-term urban infrastructure investments
including those for transport development, and at meeting the immediate and
urgent need of the bulk of the population for improved public transport serv-
ice and related traffic circulation improvements. The short-term transport
element of the project will have a significant and positive impact on the
mobility of the lower income segment of the population and its access to
urban activities. Total bus ridership is presently on the decline because
of inadequate service. Some of the potential riders would, in time, be
able to afford cheap communal taxis and yet others, private cars. The
majority, however, are too poor to afford taxis and are presently forced
to walk. The provision of good quality, inexpensive bus service would ben-
efit this section of the population, and would discourage them from trans-
ferring to private cars as their incomes increase. More rapid movement of
both buses and cars would also relieve the present congestion in the heavily
pressed center city.
50.       An important quantifiable benefit is the savings in operating costs
and the increased net revenues to UBC as a result of operational and mainte-
nance improvements, partial fleet rehabilitation and new bus purchases. With
the project, there will be a greater availability of buses, operating at greater
frequency and at improved travel speeds. Under conditions of improved bus serv-
ice, the average number of passenger trips is projected to increase about 50
percent during the next five years. UBC would be recovering about half of its
diverted ridership, and incrementally adding about 75,000 new riders annually.
By 1977, there would be a net gain of 330 million trips or approximately 1,700
million passenger-kms. The rate of return on this element of the project,
based solely on producer's surplus is 10 percent. If time savings based on
improved levels of service to existing passengers and to new bus passengers
are taken into account, the rate of return on this element of the project
increases to 36 percent.
51.       The major quantifiable benefits from improvements in street and
traffic management reinforce those arising directly from improved bus serv-
ice. The improvement in traffic circulation will improve travel speeds for
cars and buses and facilitate scheduled bus operations. It will also provide
for an increased road capacity, thus preventing a worsening of the congestion
level. The benefits accruing from traffic circulation improvements can be
measured in user time savings and lower operating costs for all vehicles.
The rate of return attributable to this element is about 14 percent.



- 16 -
52.       The long range elements of the project do not lend themselves to
quantification, although they will yield major benefits. The establishment
of an urban and regional authority is of ultimate importance to changing the
existing pattern of urban growth through rational and conscious decision mak-
ing. The potential costs of inadequate and wrong decisions on transport and
other urban sectors and the corresponding benefits of timely and correct ones
are inestimable.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Iran, the draft Proj-
ect Agreement between the Bank, the City of Tehran and the United Bus Company,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of
the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed
loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
54.       The designation of the Traffic Planning Manager described in para-
graph 39 above is made a condition of effectiveness of the Agreements.
55.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
56.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 410; Roads III; US$28.0 million Loan of April 28, 1965;
Closing Date: September 30, 1973
$4.0 mn2llion was cancelled in July 1969 when two road sections were
deleted from the project. The original Cloeing Date, September 1,
1969, was first postponed to September 1, 1971, and then to December
31, 1972. The five roads have been almost conpleted and, in order
to ensure that final disbursements could be made, the Closing Date
has been postponed a third time to September 30, 1973.
Loan No. 517; Ghazvin Development; US$11.0 million Loan of October 17, 1967;
Closing Date: June 30. 1973
The progress of construction, pace of development and quality of super-
vision under the Project are generally satisfactory.  The loan amount
was reduced by half in 1971 due to the reduction in the scope of the
Project and more local procurement than had been originally anticipated.
On completion of Stage II, which is now being carried out by the
Borrower with its own resources, a total of 52,0oo ha (including 26,000 ha
under Stage I) will be fully developed. Because of a reduction in some
elements of the projeot for technical and financial reaons, utilization of
the funds has been somewhat slow. In order to enable the Borrower to util-
ize the undisbursed funds for a proposed purchase of agricultural equipment
and material, the Closing Date has been postponed for a second time to
December 31, 1973.
Loan No. 594; Dez Irrigation; US$30.0 million Loan of April 18, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974-
Progress of construction and the quality of supervision under the Project
are generally satisfactory. Irrigation facilities are available for
55,000 out of the 57,000 ha, but irrigation efficiency has been affected
because of the delays in land levelling and as the agribusiness imnple-
mentation schedules have not been adhered to. Moreover, the area reserved
for improved traditional farming, for whioh the Project Authority was
to provide land levelling, farm machinery and other supporting services,
has been reduced substantially as the result of the allocation for devel-
opment by farm corporations of a larger extent than had been originally
anticipated.
Loan No. 602; Fifth IFC - IMDBI US$40o.o mdllion Loan of May 28, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 197h
In December 1972 IMDBI prepaid, with Bank approval, $31.1 million
of the $31.3 million disbured and outateuding under this Loan.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. They
should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not pur-
port to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project
execution.

P ag9e 4 o
Loan No. 697; Roads V; US$ 40.0 million Loan of June 29, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
There have been delays in arranging for consultants to carry
out studies on transport coordination, and road maintenance.
It is understood, however, that contracts for both studies
have now been signed and that work will coimence shortly.
The Tehran Urban Transport Study was begun in March 1971,
and the consultant's Immediate Action Program submitted in
July 1972 has formed the basis of the project currently under
consideration. Disbursement, which had been slow, has accelerated
since work on road construction began in the summer of 1972.
Loan No. 716; Tehran Power Distribution; US$60.0 million
Loan of December 18, 1970;  Closing Date: December 31 1974
The project is proceeding satisfactorily but there has been
some delay in the execution owing to the Tehran Regional
Electricity Conpany's (the executing agency) unfamiliarity
with the procurement procedures required for Bank loans.
Following the recent joint review of these problems by the
Bank and TREC, procurement is inproving and disbursements
have accelerated.
Loan No. 717; Telecomimmnications I; US$36.0 mdllion Loan of
December 18, 1970; Closing Date: March 31, 1975
Procurement of telex/gentex items under the PTT component of
this project has been delayed by a decision to retender.
However, good progress is being made with exchange installa-
t-ons in the Tehran area and the targets may be exceeded;
works for provincial exchanges and telex networks are bahind
schedale by about a year. Disbursements under the loan
have accelerated and a substantial amount has been
committed.
Loan No. 718; Education I; US$19.0 million Loan of December 18,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The project is progressing satisfactorlJy. The inplementation
of the project is about five months behind schedule due to
delays in the selection of consultant architects. However,
the Project Unit is functioning satisfactorily. The disbursement
schedule has been revised and envisages a substantial increase in
disbursements irn the course of FY 973.

Loan No. 805; Pipeline: US$32.0 million. Loan of March 3, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
After some initial delay due to the reorganization of the Engineering
Department of the National Iranian Oil Conpany (NIOC), the contract
for the construction of the Rey-Tabriz oil pipeline and the contract
for the Ahwaz-Rey crude oil pipeline were awarded in March 1973. How-
ever, due to the review of requirements for the Rey-Mashad section,
work on this line has been delayed and the NIOC is considering alter-
native proposals for expansion of the Rey-Mashad system to cope with
the demand in North-Eastern Iran.
Loan No. 821; Agricultural Credit - ADFI II; Us$14.5 million
Loan of May 22, 1972; Closing Date: November 30, 1976
The loan became effective on September 25, 1972 and by February 28,
1973, about 25 percent had been disbursed. It is expected that further
disbursements will also be made faster than originalltr projected. No
major problems have been encountered.
Loan No. 855; Ports; US$29.0 million Loan of September 8, 1972:
Closing Date: April 30, 1978
Physical implementation of all elements of the project has begun on
schedule. Earth work for the four berth extension of Bandar Shahpur
is proceding satisfactorily; amtmale for berth construction and some
floating equipment have been awarded; the interim report of the Iran
Ports Studv with recommendations for future_port development was com-
pleted in June 1973 and is under review* Because o Pa change in the
equipment requirements, the Bank has agreed to revise the list of equip-
ment and to the reallocation of $1.2 million from the unallocated
categorytowa.rds purchase of additional equipment.
Loan No. 856; Power Transmission; US$51.0 million Loan of September 20,
1972; Closing Date: March 31, 1977
Procurement is behind schedule.  However, a number of tenders have
already been issued and some contracts have been awarded.
