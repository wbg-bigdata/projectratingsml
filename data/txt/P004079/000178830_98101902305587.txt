REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXKECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED THIRD LOAN
TO THE KOREA DEVELOPMENT BANK WITH THE GUARANTEE
OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
third loan to the Korea Development Bank (KDB), with the guarantee of the
Republic of Korea, for the equivalent of $110 million. The loan will bear
interest at 7.5% p.a. and will be amortized substantially in accordance with
the aggregate of the amortization schedules applicable to the specific
investment projects financed out of its proceeds. The maximum repayment
period applicable to subborrowers would be 15 years, including 3 years of
grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMY /1
2.        The latest Economic Report ("Growth and Prospects of the Korean
Economy") was distributed under cover of SecM77-158 dated March 4, 1977.
The Country Data Sheets are attached as Annex I.
Recent Economic Developments
3.        During the last few years, the external economic environment has
been subject to unexpected, sharp and sudden changes which seriously affected
economic activity in Korea and, more particularly, its external trade and pay-
ments situation. The boom in world trade led to increases in the volume of
Korean exports of 46% and 54% in 1972 and 1973 respectively. But in 1974,
the quadrupling of oil prices combined with a sharp rise in the prices of
foodgrains and capital goods led to a deterioration of 18% in the terms of
trade. At the same time, the deep recession in the industrialized countries
caused a slackening in the growth of exports to some 9%. The purchasing power
of exports, which had expanded by over 46% each year in 1972 and 1973, actually
decreased by nearly 11% in 1974. During 1975 export volume grew by a remark-
able 23%, assisted by the devaluation of the won in December 1974 and a very
vigorous drive to expand and diversify markets. However, part of this gain
was offset by a further deterioration of 10% in the terms of trade.
4.        Among the major economic targets set by the Government in 1976 were
the containment of inflation to 10% and a reduction in the balance of payments
current account deficit substantially from $1.9 billion in 1975 to $1.4 billion.
The former goal was achieved and the latter substantially surpassed. Wholesale
prices, which had increased by nearly 80% between the end of 1973 and the end
11 Paras. 2-17 are almost identical to those contained in the corresponding
section of the President's Report (No. P-2261-KO dated March 15, 1978)
for a Sixth Railway Project which was approved on March 30, 1978.



-2-
of 1975, increased by around 9% in 1976, primarily because import costs (which
more than doubled between 1972 and 1974) apparently decreased by about 2% in
1976; moreover, the growth in domestic credit was limited in 1976 to 21%
(compared with increases of 54% and 32% in 1974 and 1975 respectively).
5.        Primarily as a result of the recovery in the OECD countries,
Korea's exports increased in 1976 by 36% in volume and there was an improve-
ment of 14% in the terms of trade. While part of this increase in exports
may have been supplied by a drawing-down of inventories, it is evident
that it could not have been achieved without substantial additions to
production capacity in the last couple of years. A remarkable feature of
Korea's economic management through the crisis of 1974 and 1975 was that
fixed investment continued to grow at an average of 11% p.a. in constant
1970 prices, raising its ratio to GNP from 24.3% in 1973 to 25.6% in 1975.
6.        The real growth of GNP in 1976 was 15.5% as compared with an
average increase of 8.5% in the two previous years. This was the result
primarily of buoyant exports, but the extraordinary growth in agricultural
output was also a significant factor. Value added in agriculture grew
at over 7% in each of the last two years. While weather conditions were
favorable over the past three seasons, there has also been a real improvement
in yields as a result of better technology and the more effective use of the
various inputs.
7.         At the end of 1976, total outstanding debt was about $7 billion
in medium and long-term maturities and an additional $2 billion in maturities
of less than one year. Debt service payments of nearly $1 billion in 1976
were well within Korea's repayment capacity. The ratio of debt service pay-
ments to exports (of goods and nonfactor services) declined from an average
of 21% in the early 1970s to 11% at the end of 1976.
8.        It would appear that Korea achieved several of the objectives it
set for itself in the Third Plan (1972-76), despite the balance of payments
difficulties experienced in 1974 and 1975 and a generally less favorable
international economic environment than had been expected. The rate of
growth of GNP was 11.2% p.a. compared with the original target of 8.6%.
Considerable progress has also been made in expanding the manufacturing
sector. Progress in reducing reliance on foreign savings and in restraining
inflation fell short of expectations. Furthermore, even with employment
growing at 4% p.a. during the Third Plan period, there has been little
improvement in the unemployment situation.
9.        Preliminary indications suggest that industrial production, exports
and balance of payments targets for 1977 have been realized. Industrial pro-
duction, which rose at an annual rate of over 9% during the first four months
of 1977, increased at a faster pace in the subsequent months; a real growth
rate of GNP of 10% appears to have been achieved. Exports are expected to
have risen by about 28% and imports by 25%. Services receipts were higher
than originally projected due to a considerable increase in both tourism and
remittances from workers and construction companies overseas. The current
account balance improved significantly. Price increases averaged about 10%



-3-
as planned. The increase in money supply resulting from the unexpected high
level of net foreign assets is exercising pressures on prices, and the
Government is restraining inflation by further liberalization of food
and other imports as well as by keeping low the prices of grains released
from government stocks under the Grain Management Fund.
Longer-Term Prospects and Program
10.       The preparation of the Fourth Plan (1977-81) afforded an oppor-
tunity for a comprehensive review of Korea's economic problems, prospects and
priorities. Korea's longer-term goals as specified in the Plan are "growth
with enhanced self-sufficiency" and "greater equity and social development."
It is the firm intention of the Korean Government to achieve a maximum rate
of growth consistent with a sound balance of payments and also with the main-
tenance of internal financial stability. The Plan projects that the current
account deficit will be eliminated during the next few years. National sav-
ings are expected to finance as much as 92% of total investment as compared
with about 72% in the Third Plan period (1972-76). However, these projections
may prove overly optimistic. The domestic savings target appears somewhat
ambitious, while the projected investment requirements may turn out to be too
low.
11.       Growth and stability are not the only objectives.  Enhanced equity
and greater social development are also of importance in the Korean scheme of
things. The main emphasis is: (a) on providing adequate employment oppor-
tunities for the rapidly growing labor force to prevent any increase in the
unemployment problem; and (b) on achieving a wider distribution of the bene-
fits of growth. Rising employment is the most important instrument for
achieving an equitable distribution of the benefits of growth. This is all
the more so because, despite the success in reducing the rate of growth of
population to around 1.8% p.a., the labor force continues to grow at over
3% p.a. because of the baby boom following the Korean War in the early 1950s.
Health outlays will increase as a proportion of total investment with special
stress on preventive care and an innovative health delivery system to service
low income families, especially in the rural areas. Rural incomes are
expected to increase as a result of a further improvement in agricultural
terms of trade and increased opportunities for nonfarm employment, primarily
through the Saemaeul (New Community) Movement and small industries development.
The quality of life in lhe rural areas is to be further enhanced by the
provision of additional infrastructure facilities.
12.       The achievement of these goals would not require a change in
the basic development strategy of export-led growth, which Korea has
followed so successfully since the mid-sixties. GNP is expected to rise
at 9.2% p.a., fueled by the growth of 16% p.a. in the volume of manufactured
exports. The manufacturing sector, which now contributes 32% of GNP, is
expected to provide 54% of the increase in GNP during the Plan period,
increasing at 14.3% a year. The ratio of commodity exports to GNP is
expected to rise from the current level of about 30% to about 42% in 1981,
with the manufacturing sector providing about 92% of total exports compared



- 4 -
with 90% in 1976. This demands the achievement of continuous gains in effi-
ciency and productivity. Korea's comparative advantage will gradually shift
towards manufactures, such as machinery, electronics and shipbuilding, which
require relatively more skilled labor. These changes in the industrial
structure will require intensive efforts to improve the mechanisms for
the transfer of foreign technology and the development of appropriate indi-
genous technology.
13.       The Plan targets for exports are challenging but appear to be
attainable, given the extraordinary drive of the Korean exporters, a con-
tinuation of the present level of export incentives and the assumption that
the economies of the OECD countries will grow at an average rate of around
4-5% annually, while the volume of world trade expands at an annual rate of
about 8% during the period.
14.       Strong policy measures are envisioned in the Plan to increase the
mobilization of domestic resources. Success in restraining inflation is
expected to have a significantly favorable effect on the mobilization of
private savings. In the past, private savings have fluctuated with the move-
ment of the terms of trade and the rate of inflation. The terms of trade are
projected to be fairly stable through the Fourth Plan period and a rate of
inflation of the order of 8-9% a year is foreseen. The Government has taken
measures designed to channel the higher private savings likely to be gener-
ated by these developments to an increasing extent into the financial sys-
tem, and, thereby, into more effective use for productive investments. In
addition to restoring a positive real rate of return on financial forms of
savings, the measures include the imposition of a capital gains tax at the
rate of 50% on undeveloped land and 30% on nonprincipal household dwellings.
Funds that went into real estate are now flowing into the securities market
where the after-tax yields are more attractive. At the same time, direct
measures have been taken to force corporations to "go public," thus increas-
ing the supply of corporate securities. Steps are also being taken to
increase the variety of financial securities in terms of maturities, yields
and conditions that would constitute an attractive package to investors.
15.       The measures to increase the mobilization of private savings
are supplemented by fiscal actions to increase public savings. The defense
tax surcharge imposed in 1975 is to be continued and a value added tax has
been introduced. The extent of the subsidization of farmers and urban
consumers through the Grain Management Fund is being reduced. The increased
resource mobilization and the strong restraint on most current expenditures
will make substantial budgetary surpluses available to finance capital
expenditures.
16.       The Plan's priorities, strategy and programs are sound.  The con-
tinued emphasis on relatively rapid growth is essential in the light of the
need to create additional employment for the growing labor force. Further-
more, the predominant role the export sector is expected to play is appro-
priate in view of Korea's limited natural resources. Moreover, Korea has the
manpower and the entrepreneurial capacity to implement the Plan's invest-
ment program. The Plan's major objectives are to increase employment,



- 5 -
maintain a minimum growth of per capita incomes, strengthen the balance of
payments and make progress towards diversifying the industrial structure so
as to sustain export growth in the 1980s.
17.       Notwithstanding the efforts being made to increase the mobilization
of domestic resources, Korea's ability to meet its investment requirements,
which have perhaps been understated, from domestic savings may fall short of
the Plan projections, and a sizeable continuing inflow of external capital
will be necessary. It is estimated that Korea may need to borrow an average
of at least $2.5 billion p.a. over the next several years. While Korea is
extending its use of commercial financing from the traditional suppliers and
private bank credits to Euro-dollar syndicated loans and bond issues in the
Euro-bond and Asia bond markets, the magnitude of its external capital
requirements is such that it will have to continue to rely on considerable
capital inflows from official sources, including Eximbanks. On the assumption
that Korea can obtain the required inflow of capital on reasonable terms, the
debt service ratio which now stands at around 11% is expected to decline
slowly to just under 10% at the end of the decade and remain at about that
level during the 1980s.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
18.       As of March 31, 1978, Korea had received 38 Bank Loans (including
one Third Window Loan) and 8 IDA Credits, totalling $1,894.5 million in loans
and $106.8 million in credits (taking into account cancellations and the
refinancing of one IDA Credit in a subsequent Bank Loan).
19.       A substantial part ($678.2 million) of Bank financing has been for
the transport sector. $325.5 million has been lent for agricultural projects.
The Korea Development Finance Corporation has received $220 million, the
Korea Development Bank $142.5 million, and the Medium Industry Bank $85 mil-
lion in Bank loans for relending to private industry. An additional $80.0 mil-
lion has been lent directly to industry in support of a heavy machinery
project. A total of $103.3 million has been provided for three education
projects and a vocational training project; $25.0 million for a tourism
project; $15.0 million for a secondary cities project; and $155 million for
two rural infrastructure projects. In addition, two Program Loans amounting
to $175 million have also been granted to Korea.
20.       As of March 31, 1978, $719.3 million of the total Bank lending
remained undisbursed on effective Loans and Credits, mostly from commitments
in the past two years. The rate of disbursement has increased quite markedly
in recent months. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Loans,
IDA Credits, and IFC Investments as of that date and notes on the execution
of ongoing projects. As indicated in the notes, progress on project imple-
mentation is generally satisfactory.



6-
21.       Excluding one project that was subsequently cancelled, IFC had by
March 31, 1978, entered into 18 commitments totalling $70.2 million (net
of participations and cancellations).
22.      The emphasis which the Government places on agricultural and
rural development is reflected in the Bank's proposed lending program.
An agriculture marketing project and a multipurpose project, including an
irrigation component, are under preparation.
23.       The further development of the industrial and agricultural
sectors and the anticipated growth of exports will require concurrent
infrastructural development. Although the transport sector will be given
less emphasis than in the past, the investments required are large, and thus
there is considerable support for this sector in the proposed program.
24.       The share of the Bank Group in Korea's total external debt dis-
bursed and outstanding at the end of 1976 was about 8.9%, and the share of
debt service was of the order of 4.9% at that time. These ratios are
expected to increase to around 18% and 11%, respectively, by the end of the
present decade.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
25.       Korea has been able to sustain an impressive record of economic
performance for more than a decade, achieving an average growth rate of
aggregate real GNP of nearly 10% p.a. since 1962. This appears all the more
remarkable when judged in the context of the country's poor endowment of
natural resources. Since most of the country is mountainous, only about a
quarter of the land area is cultivable. Korea's mineral resources are also
limited: the country's principal known mineral resource still is anthracite
coal, available in quantity, but of relatively poor coking quality.
26.       Given the poor natural resource endowment, Korea's growth strategy
has been based on the expansion of manufacturing activity and of manufactured
exports, rather than on import substitution as has been the case in several
developing countries. Rapid growth induced considerable structural changes
in the economy. Though agriculture grew on average at a rate of 4% p.a.
between 1961-77, the rapid growth of the manufacturing sector, at nearly 19%
p.a. (almost double the rate of growth of real aggregate GNP), transformed
the economy from a predominantly agricultural one (the share of agriculture,
forestry, and fisheries, in GNP was 44% in 1961, while that of mining and
manufacturing was only 12%) to one which is significantly dependent on
mining and manufacturing (by 1977, the share of mining and manufacturing
in GNP rose to around 36%). One notable feature of Korea's rapid industriali-
zation is that it has substantially contributed to the improvement in the
country's income distribution which is now among the most equitable in the
developing world.



-7-
27.       The principal impetus to this extraordinary transformation of the
economy came from the growth of manufactured exports. In the early 1960s,
exports, though growing in relation to GNP, were still not very significant.
In 1965, commodity exports were $175 million; of this total, manufactured
exports amounted to $144 million, constituting about 8% of manufactured
output. By 1977, commodity exports, growing at about 32% in constant prices
over the previous decade, reached the $10 billion mark. The share of manufac-
tured exports in the total was close to 90% and their share in manufactured
output was over 25%. The growth of manufactured exports was accompanied by
some changes in the structure of exports. Though Korea's export pattern con-
tinued to display a high degree of reliance on a few labor-intensive traditional
exports: textiles, clothing, footwear, plywood, and certain miscellaneous
manufactures, there was a discernible trend in the direction of more sophis-
ticated skill-intensive products. Several new light industry goods, such as
travel goods and plastic articles, and heavy industry products, such as
electrical machinery, machine tools, electronic goods and components, and
transport equipment (including ships), were added to Korea's range of manu-
factured exports. At thet same time, despite the relatively negligible role
of import substitution in the aggregate, the pursuit of backward linkages,
usually from exports, enabled domestic production to replace imports in
certain selective sectors, e.g. textiles, apparel, sewing machines, certain
metal products and chemicals, and particularly after 1968, in particular
sectors of the basic metal, petrochemical and machinery industries. This has
enabled Korea to prevent its aggregate dependence on imported intermediates
and investment goods fromn rising significantly over the last decade.
28.       Korea's export performance and its efforts at selective import
substitution were also reflected in the structural changes which occurred in
the manufacturing sector over the last decade. While value added in manufac-
turing rose at an annual rate of about 19% p.a. (in constant prices), between
1962 and 1977, the composition of manufacturing output changed quite signifi-
cantly in favor of the metals, machinery and chemicals subsectors. The share
of these three major manufacturing groups rose from 21% in 1961 to about 45%
in 1977. The most striking increase was registered by the combined machinery,
electronics and shipbilding industries spearheaded by electronic products.
Korea's efforts at reducing the concentration of its exports to the US
and Japan have also met with considerable success; the combined share of
these two countries dropped to 52% in 1977 from a level of 70% in 1974;
commodity exports to the Middle East, earlier negligible, exceeded $1.0
billion in 1977.
29.       Several factors have contributed to this remarkable industrial and
export performance:  e.g. the impact of the concentration on labor-intensive
activities; the efficiency of factor use in manufacturing (the sector is
characterized by low capital-output and capital-labor ratios); the rapid
growth of labor productivity, due to the high levels of education, skills and
labor discipline, as well as the magnitude of investment in industry which
grew at an average rate of about 13% p.a. during the last decade; the aligning
of wage levels with productivity increases which has helped to maintain
Korea's competitive position with respect to its competitors - other develop-
ing countries such as the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, as well as the



-8-
Republic of China, Singapore and Hong Kong in certain product categories; and
the combination of appropriate exchange rate and export policies maintained
the profitability of Korean exports in the face of relatively high rates of
domestic inflation without jeopardizing the efficiency of resource allocation.
30.       Korea's long-term development plans are formulated on the premise
that export-led manufacturing growth will remain the key element in Korea's
development strategy; in fact, compared to the pattern established over the
past decade, the Fourth Plan expects to accomplish an increase in the relative
importance of both manufacturing activity and manufactured exports by 1981.
Thus, while GNP is expected to grow at a rate of about 9% over the Fourth
Plan period, the industrial sector is expected to maintain a rate of growth
of about 14% p.a., fueled by an annual growth rate of manufactured exports of
about 16.5%. As in the past, the country's industrialization strategy will
continue to link changes in Korea's industrial sector to the process of
export expansion. While attempts will be made to deepen the structure of
Korean industry and enhance self-sufficiency in the use of intermediates and
capital goods, e.g. by import substitution in the metals, machinery and
chemical sectors, export expansion is in general expected to absorb an
increasing share of the output of heavy industry. The continued expansion of
exports, the increased emphasis on manufactured activity, the concentration
on the potentially skilled labor intensive machinery industries, and the
associated expansion of services, is expected to maintain the aggregate
employment elasticity at about the historical levels (i.e. 0.37) achieved
over the period 1963-75, and to accommodate the creation of about 2 million
jobs over the period of the Fourth Plan.
31.       The Plan's estimate of total investment required for the expansion
and restructuring of Korea's industrial sector is around $10.5 billion over the
1977-81 period. There are grounds for believing, however, that Korea's invest-
ment needs for 1977-81 may have been underestimated, while the domestic savings
target (which calls for an increase in the proportion of domestic savings to
GNP from 16.3% in 1970 to 27.1% in 1981) may be ambitious despite Korea's
good savings performance in 1976-77. As indicated in para. 17, the conjunc-
tion of these two possibilities would lead to continued reliance on substantial
inflows of foreign capital. The Korean Government has, however, in recent
years undertaken a major effort to mobilize domestic resources. It has
sought to stimulate savings by attempting to increase real rates of return on
financial assets. It has facilitated the flow of funds between savers and
investors by encouraging the growth of commercial banks and the development
banking system, the strengthening of the money market through the establish-
ment of short-term finance companies, and the growth of the securities market
to accommodate the needs of long-term finance. To meet these ends the
Government, among other measures, has facilitated the establishment of
several merchant banking institutions, the "going public" of large privately-
held business enterprises, the restructuring of the Korean Securities Finance
Corporation and the institution of Trust Funds. Moreover, in 1973, the
Government established the National Investment Fund (NIF) to supplement the
program of resource mobilization through the financial system. Apart from
deposits in banking institutions and savings funds, NIF derives its funds
from a variety of other sources such as national savings associations,
pension funds, postal savings and NIF bond sales to the public.



- 9-
32.       The Government has also sought to direct the flow of available
resources to sectors consiLdered strategic to the success of the Fourth Plan,
the specialized banks, development banks and the NIF serving as the instru-
ments for the allocation of credit to selected sectors on preferential terms.
Korea's three major development finance institutions, KDB, KDFC and MIB, were
responsible for almost two thirds of the total medium and long-term loans
extended in Korea in 1977:; in the same year, three quarters of NIF funds were
directed to the heavy engiLneering sectors; in 1976, the Korean Export Import
Bank was empowered to borrow in international markets in order to actively
engage in the support of the country's growing volume of exports of capital
goods.
33.       The Bank has worked closely with the Government in the formulation
and implementation of Korea's industrial and financial policies, and is in
basic agreement with the main thrust of the plans and priorities outlined in
the Fourth Plan. The Bank has already made six loans to KDFC and two to MIB;
the proposed loan will be the Bank's third to KDB and represents the conti-
nuation of our assistance, through financial intermediaries, to Korea's
industrial sector. All three institutions have obtained loans from the ADB;
KDB and KDFC have also made commendable and successful efforts to borrow from
commercial sources abroad. The magnitude of the demand for term finance in
Korea is such that these three institutions, even if their operations increase
significantly, will continue to be complementary rather than competitive.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
34.       A report entitled "Staff Appraisal Report on the Korea Development
Bank" (No. 1979a-KO dated May 1, 1978) is being distributed separately.
Supplementary project data are provided in Annex III. Negotiations were held
in Washington from April 26 to 28, 1978 with a Korean delegation led by Mr.
H. K. Kang, Counselor at the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in Washington.
35.       The proposed loan of $110 million would be the Bank's third to
KDB. The first loan has been almost fully disbursed and of the second loan
of $82.5 million (No. 1338-KO), which became effective on March 21, 1977,
about $52 million had been committed as of March 31, 1978. KDB's perfor-
mance has been very satisfactory.
KDB's Role Within the Financial System
36.       KDB was established in 1954 as a wholly government-owned finan-
cial institution. After concentrating on post-war reconstruction and reha-
bilitation in its first few years, KDB began to shift the emphasis of
its operations to development financing and, by the late 1960's, had become by
far the predominant industrial development bank in Korea. As a matter of
government policy with respect to the demarcation of functions amongst
government-owned financial institutions, KDB's normal business focus is on
relatively large to large enterprises in both the public and private sectors.



- 10 -
The responsibility for assisting medium- and small-scale industries rests
primarily with two other government-owned institutions, namely MIB and the
Citizens National Bank (CNB). The current division of responsibilities
between KDB, MIB and CNB is appropriate, because it allows them to provide
specialized assistance covering the full spectrum of Korean industries
(small, medium and large). KDB operates alongside the privately-owned KDFC
which also concentrates on relatively large industrial enterprises.
Legal Framework, Organization and Management
37.       KDB's operations are governed by the KDB Act and are subject to the
general supervision of the Minister of Finance. The Act establishes the
broad framework for KDB's policies, scope of activities, administration and
capitalization. It is supplemented in more detail by the Enforcing Decree,
By-Laws, Operating Manuals and a Policy Statement. The latter, adopted and
successively amended by KDB in consultation with ADB and the Bank, sets out
appropriate operating policies, financing criteria and guidelines for finan-
cial prudence. KDB operates within the ambit of government policies but
enjoys adequate autonomy in its operational decisions.
38.       KDB remains a well-managed and well-organized institution with a
competent staff. Apart from its head office, consisting of 21 departments,
it has nine domestic branch offices and six overseas representative offices.
As of December 31, 1977, its staff numbered 1,767, including 573 professionals.
Staff turnover has increased in recent years but is expected to remain
within manageable proportions. Staff training is systematic and thorough.
KDB continues to be able to attract new recruits of a high caliber.
39.       KDB is administered by a full-time Board of Executive Directors
comprising the Governor (who is KDB's Chief Executive Officer and is appointed
by the President of the Republic), the Deputy Governor (appointed by the
Minister of Finance), and seven Executive Directors (appointed by the
Minister of Finance), each assuming direct managerial responsibility over
two to four departments. Historically, all Executive Directors have been
appointed from within KDB's staff, thus ensuring an experienced and profes-
sional management. Mr. Woun Gie Kim was appointed KDB's Governor in 1972.
He provides KDB with effective leadership.
Scope of Operations and Development Impact
40.       By the multiplicity of its activities and the magnitude of its
operations, KDB exerts a considerable impact on the economy. Over the years,
it has considerably broadened its operations. It now provides industry, both
public and private, with the full range of financial and technical services
typically made available by a development bank, e.g. medium- and long-term
loans for equipment and working capital financing in both domestic and
foreign currencies; guarantees; equity participations; foreign exchange
transactions (letters of credit); and technical assistance to client companies.
In addition, KDB acts as an executing arm for the Government in the implemen-
tation and financing of major investment projects in priority sectors (electri-



- 11 -
city, railways, steel, iron, coal, air and marine transportation, machinery,
shipbuilding, basic metalis and electronics). It is actively involved
in the preparation and formulation of government policies for the industrial
sector, including those contained in the Fourth Plan. It undertakes and
publishes considerable research work in the financial and industrial sectors.
To supplement its own development banking activities and help improve the
Korean financial system, KDB has established specialized subsidiaries to
operate in the machinery leasing business and merchant banking.
41.       KDB is by far the largest source of industrial finance in Korea.
As of December 31, 1977, its outstanding loan portfolio of W 1,008 billion
($2.0 billion) accounted for 16% of total loans (both short- and long-term)
and about one-half of term loans of all banking and financial institutions
in Korea to the manufacturing sector. Of the above amount, 88.1% represented
equipment term loans and the balance of 11.9% working capital loans. Its
disbursements for loans and investments increased by 49% in 1977, amounting
to W 406 billion ($837 million), and financed directly one fifth of fixed
manufacturing investment during that year. Including its guarantee opera-
tions (W 1,096 billion or $2.2 billion), KDB assisted in the financing of
about 38% of Korea's total fixed capital formation during 1977. KDB's
clients fall into three broad categories: public enterprises in the energy,
transportation, infrastructure and manufacturing sectors; some large private
enterprises whose financing requirements are so large that KDB alone amongst
the Korean financial institutions is able to assist them (in most cases, in
conjunction with other lenders); and, finally, a more typical DFC clientele
consisting of medium-sized to large private enterprises. Most of the large
enterprises assisted by KDB are closely involved with smaller firms through
subcontracting arrangements, the practice of which is widespread in Korea.
As of September 30, 1977, public enterprises (45 companies) accounted for
53.6% of KDB's outstanding loan portfolio, and private enterprises (512
companies) for the balance of 46.4%. The share of the private sector has
recently increased significantly in KDB's lending, from 52.8% in 1976 to
70.9% in 1977.
42.       Apart from the volume of its operations, KDB has played an important
qualitative role in the improvement of the resource allocation and mobiliza-
tion systems in Korea. The maintenance of good appraisal standards has
ensured that resources at its disposal, including Bank funds, have been allo-
cated to projects that were both economically and financially viable. Data
on a representative sample of KDB's projects showed economic rates of return
ranging from 15% to 50%. KDB-supported projects have a major impact in
generating exports and additional employment and increasing value added. The
projects which have received KDB's assistance in 1975 and 1976 are estimated
to export about 45% of their incremental output, and to create additional
direct employment of about 38,000 and 68,000, respectively, when they are in
full operation. Substantial changes have taken place in the last few years
in the composition of KDB's portfolio in response to government policies and
the evolution and maturing of Korea's dynamic industrial sector; for instance,
the share of the capital goods industry in KDB's loan commitments has risen



- 12 -
from 22% in 1975 to 38.6% in 1977. KDB has endeavored to improve the design
of projects it finances and provides its clients with useful managerial and
technical assistance.
43.       KDB has formulated a statement of Development Strategy for the
period 1978-79 highlighting its specific short-run developmental objectives
which include, inter alia, the following: (a) intensified assistance to such
priority sectors as the machinery and basic metal industries; (b) further
enhancing its resource allocation impact by focussing on such economic
factors as export orientation, employment creation, forward and backward
linkages and geographical dispersal, in taking investment decisions;
(c) increasing technical assistance by providing consultancy services to
clients; and (d) intensified efforts to mobilize private resources from both
the domestic and foreign capital markets.
Operational Standards and Procedures
44.       The standard of KDB's operations is high.  KDB's appraisal
work is satisfactory, with increasing emphasis being put on economic analysis,
in particular the employment impact of projects. Its project supervision
work is thorough and effective, as reflected in the good quality of its
portfolio. Its economic and industrial research work is extensive. KDB's
procurement and disbursement practices are sound. It usually requires that
import procurement be based on three or more competitive quotations from
suppliers, or international competitive bidding whenever appropriate, and its
staff carefully checks the price and suitability of the equipment to be
purchased, based on their experience with similar projects previously
financed by KDB.
Financial Position and Performance
45.       As of December 31, 1977, KDB's assets (not including contingent
assets pertaining to guarantees) stood at W 1,420 billion ($2.9 billion),
having grown by an annual average of 30% since 1974. Of this amount,
W 1,248 billion or 88% represented outstanding loans and investments. Net
worth amounted to W 365 billion accounting for 25.7% of total assets, having
grown rapidly by about 50% annually since 1974. KDB's financial position is
sound, with a total debt/equity ratio close to 4.9:1 (debt excludes guarantees
for which the financial risk is assumed by the Government), a long-term
debt/equity ratio of 3.7:1, and a current ratio of 1.3:1 as of the above date,
and a debt service cover of 1.6 for 1977. Although showing an improving
trend, KDB's profitability remains relatively low, with net income repre-
senting a return of 2.4% on average total assets and 8.3% on average net
worth in 1977. This relatively low profitability reflects the fact that KDB,
as a public development finance institution, undertakes a broad range of
developmental functions (such as research activities and administration of
government funds at a nominal fee). KDB's institutional efficiency is best
illustrated by its very low administrative expenses which averaged only 1% of
total assets for the period 1974-77.



- 13 -
46.       A noteworthy feature of KDB's financial position is the fact that
KDB is relieved of the financial risk (which is assumed by the Government)
with respect to: (a) guarantees issued by KDB to Government-controlled
enterprises and certain priority enterprises as defined in the KDB Act (these
enterprises accounted for 86% of all KDB's guarantees as of September 30,
1977); and (b) loans made by KDB to public sector enterprises at the Govern-
ment's behest, amounting to W 353 billion and accounting for 40% of the
outstanding loan portfolio as of that date. The above arrangements resulted
from agreements reached between the Government, KDB and the Bank during
negotiations for the two preceding Bank loans.
47.       The quality of KDB's portfolio (of loans, investments and guarantees)
is very good, reflecting the high standards of its appraisal and follow-up
work as well as the strength of the Korean economy in recent years. As of
December 31, 1977, arrears of principal and interest on loans represented
only 0.2%, and the portfolio affected by arrears, 1.4% of the loan portfolio
outstanding. Loan collection has been highly satisfactory, averaging 97% in
past years. The equity investment portfolio amounting to W 217 billion (or
15% of total assets) is equally sound, and represents a source of potential
sizeable capital gains to KDB. As with its loan portfolio, KDB's large
portfolio of guarantees (equivalent to 2.5 times its total assets) remains
very sound, with arrears representing 0.1% of the guarantee portfolio
outstanding.
Resource Position and Mobilization
48.       As of December 31, 1977, KDB had total resources of W 1,397 bil-
lion, of which 84% were long-term domestic resources, 5% domestic short-
term resources and 11% foreign exchange funds. Equity remains the single
largest source of funds (26.1%), followed by borrowings from the NIF (21%).
49.       As a wholly Government-owned development bank, KDB has to depend
to a large extent on funds provided by the Government and the NIF, particu-
larly since it is the Government's basic policy to use, on the one hand, the NIF
as a vehicle for mobilizing domestic savings from a variety of sources
(para. 31) and, on the cither, KDB and other development finance institutions
for allocating the resources so mobilized by the NIF. For the country as a
whole, domestic saving has been highly satisfactory, having increased
substantially from 7.5% of GNP in 1965 to 16.3% in 1970 and 18% in 1975.
(As stated in para. 31, it is the Government's objective to raise this
savings rate to 27.1% of GNP by 1981.) Savings mobilized through the NIF
accounted for 8.5% of total domestic savings in 1975. Nothwitstanding the
fact that KDB's primary function is to allocate resources, KDB has in recent
years made commendable efforts to mobilize private resources in order to
supplement those made available to it by the Government and the NIF. On the
domestic currency side, it has issued bonds (generally with two or three-year
maturity) aggregating about W 170 billion and accounting on an outstanding
basis for about 5% of its total resources. The present situation of the
domestic capital market does not allow KDB to issue bonds with longer
maturities (say, up to five or seven years) in any significant amount,



- 14 -
whereas KDB's own loans generally have maturities of between 8 to 12 years.
Hence, KDB's continuing need for long-term domestic currency funds from the
Government and the NIF. Even if KDB were able to issue long-term bonds,
these would most likely compete with NIF's own bonds and therefore might not
augment the volume of overall savings mobilized. KDB's domestic resource
mobilization efforts should be seen as a supplement to those of NIF, and
indeed to Korea as a whole.
50.       On the foreign currency side, KDB has in recent years raised
$419 million from commercial sources (of which $294 million in 1976-77), to
supplement the amount of $335 million it has obtained from official sources
(such as the IBRD, ADB, USAID). In April 1978, KDB was involved in arranging
a foreign commercial loan of $300 million. The proceeds of the loan are
to be allocated to KDB, the Korea Exchange Bank and some Korean commercial
banks and it is yet unclear how much of this loan KDB will receive. The
Government itself determines, on a year-to-year basis, the amount of foreign
commercial funds which KDB should try to raise in a given year, as well as
the magnitude of the inflow of such funds into Korea for the year. Foreign
commercial borrowings generally have short maturities (of between two and
seven years) whereas KDB lends to investment projects requiring long-term
finance (of up to twelve years). Furthermore, the total amount of foreign
commercial resources which KDB is able to obtain has been, and is expected to
remain, dependent on the Government's policy regarding borrowing from the
international capital market. In view of the foregoing, KDB will continue to
require funds from official sources, such as the Bank, in addition to its
foreign commercial borrowings. It is, however, KDB's intention, supported by
Government, to mobilize foreign commercial loans in larger amounts in the
years to come to meet the increasing demand for import financing (para. 52).
Business and Financial Forecasts
51.       KDB expects to expand its total commitments annually by 14% for
loans and 20% for equity investments over the five-year period 1977-81, thus
bringing its share of the financing of fixed capital formation from around
12% to 15%. Foreign currency loan commitments in particular are expected to
increase from $85 million in 1977 to about $200 million in 1982, an average
annual growth of 18%. Guarantee operations are projected at about $1.1 bil-
lion a year, slightly below the actual level during 1974-77. KDB's total
assets are forecast to increase from W 1,419 billion in 1977 to W 3,520 bil-
lion in 1982, an average annual growth of about 18%. KDB's financial position,
as projected, would remain sound, with the current ratio around 1.5, the debt
service cover around 1.4, and the long-term debt/equity ratio remaining
within the agreed limit of 5:1 (Section 4.06 of the draft Loan Agreement).
The quality of KDB's portfolio is expected to remain sound.
52.       To meet its forecast commitments, KDB would need to borrow a total
of W 2,673 billion ($5.5 billion), including $1.3 billion in foreign
currency, for the five-year period 1978-82. On the domestic currency side,
the Government is expected, as in the past, to continue to provide KDB with
adequate long-term resources through both the NIF and equity allocations from
the Government, its only shareholder, to sustain KDB's lending activities;
additionally, KDB plans to raise a sum of W 400 billion (or 20% of domestic



- 15 -
resources) from the market through bond issues. On the foreign currency
side, KDB plans to raise about $615 million from commercial sources, as
against the $715 million it hopes to borrow from international institutions
and other official sources over the five-year period. The proposed Bank loan
of $110 million would cover slightly less than one-half of KDB's projected
foreign exchange commitments over the next two years, with the balance to be
financed by prospective borrowings from other institutional lenders (e.g.
ADB) and commercial sources.
Main Features of the Loan
53.       Apart from direcl: imports, the proceeds of the loan would be
utilized by KDB to finance the foreign exchange component, estimated at 60%,
of domestically procured capital goods (Section 2.02(a) of the draft Loan
Agreement). As stated above, the long-term debt/equity limit of 5:1, set
under the two previous Bank loans, would be maintained. In view of the
satisfactory and improving standard of KDB's appraisal work, it is recom-
mended that the free limit on subprojects, set at $1.5 million under the
previous loan, be raised to $2.5 million. A ceiling of $7.5 million (as
against $5 million under tlhe previous loan) would be set on the size of
individual subloans; and no more than 25% of the total loan amount would go
to any single industrial activity or subsector. KDB intends to relend the
loan proceeds at an interest rate that would give it a spread of two percen-
tage points; this spread is in line with the practice of government-owned
development finance institutions in Korea and is more than adequate to cover
the cost incurred by KDB in processing foreign exchange loans. KDB's proposed
relending rate of 9.5% p.a. is appropriate, given that subborrowers bear the
foreign exchange risk and that the depreciation of the won vis a vis the
dollar has averaged 7% p.a. in the 70's. Furthermore, the Bank's practice of
disbursing a mix of currencies (including some hard currencies which have
been appreciating against the dollar) adds an unquantifiable, but substantial
margin to the cost of Bank funds to the subborrowers. The other terms and
conditions of the loan wouLld be similar to those of recent Bank loans to
DFCs, including a flexible amortization schedule conforming substantially to
the aggregate of the repayment schedules of subloans.
Financing of the Korea Industrial Leasing Company (KILC)
54.       Under the previous Bank loan ($82.5 million), a component of
$7.5 million was earmarked specifically for financing small- and medium-
sized leasing projects by KILC, a wholly-owned KDB subsidiary. The Bank
decided to finance leasing projects through KILC because KILC's machinery
leasing business, aimed primarily at medium-sized and smaller enterprises
whose limited capital base and borrowing capacity did not allow them to make
outright purchases, served a useful purpose within Korea's industrial finan-
cing system. It is recommended that KDB be authorized to utilize up to
$10 million under the proposed loan for further financing of leasing pro-
jects through KILC. For the sake of administrative simplicity, KDB would
make available this amount to KILC by way of subloans. In view of the Bank's
satisfactory experience with KILC to date, it is no longer necessary to
create a component with specific administrative safeguards in order to



- 16 -
continue the Bank's financing of KILC. The specific project eligibility
criteria applied under the previous loan would, however, continue under the
proposed loan (Schedule 3 to the draft Loan Agreement).
Benefits and Risks
55.       The continued growth of the export-oriented industrial sector
remains a key objective for Korea's development strategy under the ongoing
Fourth Plan for the period 1977-81. KDB, whose performance to date has been
highly satisfactory from both the developmental and institutional standpoints,
and whose role is crucial within the country's financial system, is a particu-
larly suitable intermediary for allocating resources for the development of
the industrial sector. Apart from being an efficient resource allocator,
KDB has made and is expected to continue to make significant qualitative and
developmental contributions to the Korean economy. These include KDB's
extensive economic and industrial research work, its inputs into Government
policies in the industrial and financial sectors, its promotional activities,
and its initiative in establishing KILC. The Bank's association with KDB,
although of relatively recent date, has already proved to be a productive
and beneficial one. Through KDB as an intermediary, Bank resources (totaling
$112 million on a commitment basis) have been efficiently allocated to
95 projects (including 34 leasing projects financed through KILC), which
are economically as well as financially viable, in the manufacturing,
mining, infrastructure and transport sectors of the Korean economy. This
association has enabled the Bank, notwithstanding the relatively low propor-
tion of its lending in relation to KDB's overall resources, to exert its
influence in encouraging KDB to improve its operational standards as well as
to enhance its developmental impact. It is expected that, over the period of
commitment of the proposed loan, KDB will achieve further progress from both
the institutional and developmental points of view.
56.       Projects financed to date under the two previous Bank loans have
economic rates of return ranging from 15 to 50%, and are generally heavily
export oriented. Subprojects to be financed by KDB under the proposed loan,
although not yet identified, are expected to produce similar economic
benefits. Subprojects to be financed by KILC (for up to $10 million of the
total loan amount) are expected to be of small or medium size. The project
does not entail any unusual risk.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
57.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Korea Development
Bank, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Korea and the
Bank, and the report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4
(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. The special features of this loan are listed
in Section III of Annex III.



- 17 -
58.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
59.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION /1
Agricultural Sector
Loan No. 795      Yong San Gang Irrigation Project; $33.0 Million Loan
Credit No. 283   and $15.0 Million Credit of February 2, 1972; Effective
Date: September 15, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project, located in one of the most drought-prone areas of
Korea, provides four storage dams, canal systems and land development to
irrigate 33,700 ha. The project was delayed initially by modifications
in the design of the dams and later when rapid inflation outpaced the
allocation of local funds. The dams have now been completed and about
19,000 ha was irrigated in 1977. Good progress is being made on other
works which are expected to be completed by mid-1978, about 18 months
behind schedule. Consequently, the Closing Date has been extended from
September 30, 1977 to December 31, 1978. The project cost is estimated
at about $151 million compared to $88.6 million at appraisal, but because
of increases in rice and barley prices, the economic rate of return is
expected to be close to the appraisal estimate of 13%.
Loan No. 942      Seeds Project; $7.0 Million Loan of November 16, 1973;
Effective Date:  April 24, 1974; Closing Date:  December 31,
1978
The project consists of: (a) the installation of five field crop
seed processing and storage facilities; (b) farm machinery for seed pro-
duction; (c) procurement of seasonal seed inventories through the operation
of a revolving fund; (d) seed testing laboratories and equipment; (e) crop
research (financed in part by USAID); (f) feasibility studies for irriga-
tion and area development; and (g) technical assistance. The necessary
legislative and administrative action for revising the Seed Law and estab-
lishing an "Office for Seed Production and Distribution" has been taken.
Project implementation, although one year behind the appraisal schedule,
is proceeding satisfactorily. Project costs (OSPD/NAPIO components) have
increased from the appraisal estimates of about $14.0 million to about
$35.0 million. Disbursement has been somewhat slower than expected at
appraisal but should substantially improve in FY78; it is envisaged that
civil works, construction and purchase of equipment will be completed in
1978.

private sector for the purpose of integrating on-farm productivity of fruits
and vegetables with modern, hygienic processing facilities, using land that
is presently idle or underutilized. The vegetables and fruits involved
are mainly asparagus, shiitake (oak mushroom), spinach, mushroom, strawberry
and peach. Implementation of the project as a whole has been slow. This is
mainly because loan demand for processing facilities, which were specifically
included in the project and account for nearly 70% of total project cost, has
been negligible. Changes in market conditions which have been primarily
responsible for this lack of demand are expected to persist during the
project period. In view of this, in September 1977 the Bank approved AFDC's
proposal to revise the project to include financing of processing facilities
for the freezing and cold storage of fish, meat, fruits and vegetables, fruit
juice extraction and concentration, and vegetable drying, for which there is
strong demand. As a result of the inclusion of these facilities, the loan
amounts approved have increased significantly. If this increased momentum in
lending is maintained as is expected by AFDC, the implementation of the
project, now about 18 months behind schedule, would not be further delayed.
Disbursements, as of March 31, 1978, were over 38% of the loan.
Loan No. 1193    Second Integrated Dairy Development Project;
$15.0 Million Loan of June 4, 1976; Effective Date:
November 11, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The project consists of: (a) the establishment of about 450 new
dairy farms; (b) the continuation of the development begun as part of the
First Integrated Dairy Beef Project on about 400 dairy farms; (c) the expan-
sion of existing processing plants, the diversification of their production,
the establishment of 2 milk collection centers and 50 small milk cooling
units and the construction of a milk products plant at Yeongnam; and (d) the
expansion of technical services for both farm development and milk processing.
Effectiveness of the project was delayed for about a year, but farm develop-
ment is progressing rapidly and the project may be completed within the
period originally foreseen. Although technical assistance for new farmers
has been somewhat weak, the Korea Dairy Beef Company (KDBC) is in the
process of strengthening its farm advisory staff. Construction of KDBC's
new processing plant and expansion of one of the existing plants are under
way, and the other existing plant will be expanded this year. KDBC's
financial situation improved over the course of 1976 and the company showed
a profit for the first time in 1977. Prospects are for continued, gradual
improvement. As of March 31, 1978, disbursements were about 35% of the loan.
Loan No. 1216    Rural Infrastructure Project; $60.0 Million Loan of which
Loan No. 1218T   $40.0 Million Third Window of March 19, 1976; Effective Date:
June 4, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Project implementation is proceeding very well. The Fuelwood,
Roads and Bridges, Water Supply and Rural Electrification components were
completed by the end of 1977. Minor Irrigation has experienced some delays,
mainly the result of budgetary shortages and a cost overrun of 18%, but
should be substantially completed by early 1979. Upland reclamation is

proceeding in accordance with the revised time schedule and will be
completed in 1978. Project monitoring and reporting continue to be satis-
factory and a good start has been made on the Hydrologic Services Study and a
major project evaluation study. The estimated cost of the project is likely
to be 16% above the appraisal estimate, mostly as a result of cost overruns
for Minor Irrigation and Rural Electrification and an increase in the size of
the Water Supply component. Disbursements are practically in line with
appraisal estimates.
Loan No. 1319    Miho Watershed Area Development Project; $29.0 Million
Loan of August 5, 1976; Effective Date: October 21, 1976;

Loan No. 1507    Second Medium Industry Bank Project; $55.0 Million Loan
of January 4, 1978; Effective Date: March 10, 1978;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The project provides $55.0 million, to be used by MIB, to help
cover the foreign exchange requirements of industrial subprojects over four
years. A substantial portion of the loan - $20.0 million - would be earmarked
to assist small-scale, labor-intensive subprojects creating employment at a
gross capital cost per job not greater than $6,000 or enterprises whose fixed
assets are not greater than $250,000.
Education Sector
Loan No. 906      Second Education Project; $23.0 Million Loan and
Credit No. 394   $0   Million Credit of June 13, 1973; Effective Date:
September 10, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project provides equipment for, and extensions to, 85 educa-
tional institutions at secondary, post secondary and university levels. It
also includes preinvestment studies on health and management education. The
Loan/Credit funds are mainly used to finance equipment, with the Government
financing the related civil works. Project execution is now about two years
behind schedule. Initial project actions were slow owing to staff shortages
in the Project Implementation Unit and the Office of Supply (OSROK), causing
delays in the preparation of designs and equipment lists. A government
internal review of procurement procedures halted equipment procurement for
almost a year. These problems are now largely resolved and the project has
been making steady progress. About 70% of the equipment has been contracted,
and 40% delivered; furniture procurement has been completed; civil works are
about 90% complete; and the fellowship program is well under way. However,
because of the initial delays and some project changes recently requested by
the Borrower, the project is now expected to be completed by June 1979,
about six months after the present Closing Date.
Loan No. 1096    Third Education Project; $22.5 Million Loan of March 31,
1975; Effective Date: June 6, 1975; Closing Date: June 30,
1980
The project includes assistance for extensions and equipping of
nine institutions (technical, agricultural and fisheries) under the Ministry
of Education (MOE) and seven vocational training institutes (VTIs) under the
Administrator of Labor Affairs (ALA). Project implementation is about
one year behind schedule. Lack of counterpart funds for consultants' fees
during the first 20 months delayed preparation of the design and bidding
documents in the MOE component. Changes of the training program of the ALA
component during implementation necessitated revisions and subsequent delays;
however, because of recent progress in both MOE and ALA components, these
delays will not affect the Closing Date of June 30, 1980. Civil works are
about 20% complete in the MOE and 67% in the ALA components. Equipment
procurement is also satisfactory, and about 38% of the MOE and 54% of the ALA

components have been contracted. Project costs are below the appraisal
estimates. Disbursements are around 11% of the total loan but would improve
significantly in the months ahead.
Loan No. 1474    Vocational Training Project; $23.0 Million Loan of
July 22, 1977; Effective Date: October 25, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The loan provides funds to help finance: (a) construction of and
equipment for 8 Vocational Training Institutes (VTIs), with 450 places each
with boarding facilities; (b) equipment for the Central Vocational Training
Institute (CVTI); and (c) expert services for the Vocational Training Bureau
(VTB), and specialist services to the CVTI and VTIs. Since effectiveness,
overall progress has been satisfactory. About 25% of the civil works will be
tendered in June 1978 (twco of the eight VTIs), equipment lists for the two
VTIs (25% of the total) haLve also been prepared by the Project Implementation
Unit and approved by the Blank. Adequate local funds have been provided
and project costs are about 20% below the appraisal estimates including
contingencies.
Tourism Sector
Loan No. 953      Kyongju Tourism Project; $25.0 Million Loan of
January 4, 1974; Effective Date: May 6, 1974;
Closing )ate: December 31, 1978
The project forms part of the first phase of the planned develop-
ment of the Bomun Lake resort near Kyongju. It provides for a multipurpose
dam; an irrigation system for about 1,200 ha; improvement and expansion of
the water supply and sewerage and solid waste disposal systems for the city
of Kyongju and the resort area; installation of electrical supply and tele-
communication facilities for the resort area; the construction and/or
realignment of about 57 km of roads, infrastructure, including storm water
drainage, environmental sanitation, community facilities, and a golf course;
a school for training hotel personnel; and a feasibility study for the
development of tourism on Cheju Island. Project implementation is now
progressing satisfactorily although completion of some project components is
likely to be delayed by about a year, due mainly to budgetary constraints.
Government has now taken steps to provide all needed funds. The delay has
had no adverse effects on hotel development. The first two hotels with 600
rooms are under construction and are scheduled to commence operations in the
spring of 1979. Negotiations with other private investors are under way for
a third hotel and also for apartments and restaurants in the Bomun resort
area. About 62% of the loan had been disbursed as of March 31, 1978.

implementation of the Secondary Cities Regional Project is pro-
ceeding satisfactorily. Three housing sites, two access roads and a city
market have been completed. Progress on the remaining two subprojects is
nearly on scheduleo Tenders for the ninth subproject are being evaluated.
Allocation of housing plots has been completed at Yeosu and Mogpo sites
where, as in the case of the Gwangju site, a strong demand for such plots
was demonstrated.  Efforts to cross-subsidize smaller plots for lower-income
families through the sale of larger plots have been most successful. AfLter
the initial delays, mainly in fulfilling conditions of effectiveness ana
establishing the Gwangju Regional Development unit, the project has moved
extremely well. Total project costs are now estimated at $22.1 million
compared to the appraisal estimate of $25.0 million ($20.8 million at
current exchange rate). A surplus of nearly $3.0 million is anticipated in
the loan amount, mainly due to devaluation of the won in December '974. As
of March 31, 1978, disbursement was 60% of the loan amount.

of about 130 km of highways and paving, chiefly on existing alignments, of
a further 634 km of national highways were completed on schedule and the
highways opened to traffic in October 1975. The cost, in US dollar equi-
valent, exceeded the estimate by about 5%. Feasibility studies for future
projects of about 1,000 km of roads were started in August 1975, followed by
detailed engineering. Delay occurred in setting up a new nationwide highway
maintenance organization but the organization has now been established in
accordance with decrees published in June 1975. All the maintenance offices
have been constructed and staffed and equipment procured under the loan. The
Government has been requeasted to increase the budgetary allocation to enable
an adequate program of periodic maintenance to be carried out. By the end of
March 1978, disbursements were around 99%, but the Closing Date has been
extended by a year to use the balance in the loan account for procurement of
spare parts needed for the maintenance equipment.
