D.      Withdrawal Tranche Release Conditions.

        1.      No withdrawal shall be made of the Single Withdrawal Tranche unless
                the Bank is satisfied:

                (a)      with the Guarantor's maintenance of an adequate
                         macroeconomic policy framework;
            (b)     with the Borrower's maintenance of (i) an appropriate
                    expenditure program, (ii) sustainable debt, and (iii) appropriate
                    fiscal arrangements with the Guarantor; and

            and

     2.     the Borrower shall ensure that upon each deposit of an amount of the
            Loan into this account, an equivalent amount is accounted for in the
            Borrower's budget management system, in a manner acceptable to the
            Bank.

F.   Excluded Expenditures. The Borrower undertakes that the proceeds of the
     Loan shall not be used to finance Excluded Expenditures. If the Bank determines
     at any time that an amount of the Loan was used to make a payment for an
     Excluded Expenditure, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank,
     refund an amount equal to the amount of such payment to the Bank. Amounts
     refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled.

G.   Closing Date. The Closing Date is January 31, 2014. The Bank will grant an
     extension of the Closing Date after the Guarantor's Ministry of Finance has
     informed the Bank that it agrees with such an extension.

1.   The following table sets forth the Principal Payment Dates of the Loan and the
     percentage of the total principal amount of the Loan payable on each Principal
     Payment Date ("Installment Share"). If the proceeds of the Loan have been fully
     withdrawn as of the first Principal Payment Date, the principal amount of the
     Loan repayable by the Borrower on each Principal Payment Date shall be
     determined by the Bank by multiplying: (a) Withdrawn Loan Balance as of the
     first Principal Payment Date; by (b) the Installment Share for each Principal
     Payment Date, such repayable amount to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any
     amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency
     Conversion applies.

2.   If the proceeds of the Loan have not been fully withdrawn as of the first Principal
     Payment Date, the principal amount of the Loan repayable by the Borrower on
     each Principal Payment Date shall be determined as follows:

     (a)     To the extent that any proceeds of the Loan have been withdrawn as of
             the first Principal Payment Date, the Borrower shall repay the
             Withdrawn Loan Balance as of such date in accordance with paragraph 1
             of this Schedule.

     (b)     Any amount withdrawn after the first Principal Payment Date shall be
             repaid on each Principal Payment Date falling after the date of such
             withdrawal in amounts determined by the Bank by multiplying the
             amount of each such withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is
             the original Installment Share specified in the table in paragraph 1 of this
             Schedule for said Principal Payment Date ("Original Installment Share")
             and the denominator of which is the sum of all remaining Original
             Installment Shares for Principal Payment Dates falling on or after such
             date, such amounts repayable to be adjusted, as necessary, to deduct any
             amounts referred to in paragraph 4 of this Schedule, to which a Currency
             Conversion applies.

3.   (a)     Amounts of the Loan withdrawn within two calendar months prior to any
             Principal Payment Date shall, for the purposes solely of calculating the
             principal amounts payable on any Principal Payment Date, be treated as
             withdrawn and outstanding on the second Principal Payment Date
             following the date of withdrawal and shall be repayable on each
             Principal Payment Date commencing with the second Principal Payment
             Date following the date of withdrawal.

     (b)     Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph, if
             at any time the Bank adopts a due date billing system under which
             invoices are issued on or after the respective Principal Payment Date, the
            provisions of such sub-paragraph shall no longer apply to any
            withdrawals made after the adoption of such billing system.

4.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Schedule, upon a
     Currency Conversion of all or any portion of the Withdrawn Loan Balance to an
     Approved Currency, the amount so converted in the Approved Currency that is
     repayable on any Principal Payment Date occurring during the Conversion
     Period, shall be determined by the Bank by multiplying such amount in its
     currency of denomination immediately prior to the Conversion by either: (i) the
     exchange rate that reflects the amounts of principal in the Approved Currency
     payable by the Bank under the Currency Hedge Transaction relating to the
     Conversion; or (ii) if the Bank so determines in accordance with the Conversion
     Guidelines, the exchange rate component of the Screen Rate.

5.   If the Withdrawn Loan Balance is denominated in more than one Loan Currency,
     the provisions of this Schedule shall apply separately to the amount denominated
     in each Loan Currency, so as to produce a separate amortization schedule for
     each such amount.
