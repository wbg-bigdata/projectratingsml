CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:             Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros
Executing Agencies:   Ministry of Health and Community Development Support Fund
(CDSF)
Credit Amount:        SDR 9.2 million (US$13.0 million equivalent)
Terms:                Standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity
Project Objectives:
The overall objective of the project is to strengthen the development of human
resources in the Comoros by: (i) increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of basic
health services, through the establishment of efficient health regions and other
supportive services, which will be capable of providing comprehensive good quality
and cost effective health care, including family planning services and Acquired
Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) prevention, and will involve community
participation, self-management and cost recovery; and (ii) by promoting
complementary community development initiatives to develop social infrastructure and
grassroots participation in small-scale productive activities, through a Community
Development Support Fund (CDSF).
Project Components:
The project has two components: population and health, and community development.
The population and health component will build upon existing successful pilot
programs for self-management and cost recovery to establish services capable of
ensuring cost-effective and sustainable provision of comprehensive and good quality
health care, including Family Planning (FP) and AIDS control services. To that end,
the component will: (i) strengthen the capacities of the three health regions to plan,
implement, administer, and supervise health care services, in part through improving
and expanding the training of district health personnel; (ii) equip and rehabilitate two
regional hospitals and a number of health centers; and (iii) promote family planning
and AIDS control services. In the second component of the project, complementary
community development activities as well as activities to encourage sustainable
economic development would be supported through a Community Development
Support Fund (CDSF). While demand driven, the CDSF would focus primarily on:
training of communities and groups in micro-project development, management, and
implementation; rehabilitation of social infrastructure (especially primary schools,
water supply, and health posts); activities to promote the well-being and development
of women; and income generating activities.



- iii -
Benefits and Risks:
The project is expected to enhance the development of human resources by improving
the health, education, and income status of the population. Through the health and
population component, available primary health care is expected to improve with the
strengthening of peripheral services and closer involvement of communities in their
provision; Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) and better Family
Planning (FP) services should increase the contraceptive prevalence rate, reducing
fertility, as well as raising awareness of the need for AIDS prevention. The CDSF
would complement activities in the health component by building upon strong
community involvement and aiding communities and individuals to more effectively
and efficiently channel community resources and implement local development efforts,
including much needed rehabilitation of primary schools, water supply and health
posts. It would provide an opportunity to strengthen the capacity of local associations
and NGOs, as well as encourage the creation of new NGOs, in addition to enhancing
the well-being and economic role of women in society.
The main risks to the implementation of the project are weak Government capacity and
potential delays due to political uncertainties. To address the first, the goal of the
health and population component is to strengthen community involvement, both
financially and managerially, in the provision of basic health services as well as to
build Government capacity and improve the efficiency of these services. More
specifically, personnel would be trained, a unit within the Ministry of Health would be
created under the Directorate General of Health Services for procurement and
administration of implementation, and technical assistance would be provided in key
areas for capacity building. To insulate the CDSF from weak Government capacity
and political interference, an autonomous agency staffed by selected, contractual
employees would manage the fund. In addition, community training, strong CDSF
supervision, a transparent management information system, and semi-annual auditing
of accounts would enhance the overall efficiency of the community development
component of the project.

FEDERAL ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF COMOROS
POPULATION AND HUMAN RESOURCES PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
1.1          The Federal Islamic Republic of Comoros became independent in 1975. It had
a GNP per capita of about US$510 and a population of about 480,000 in 1992. Comoros,
consisting of three islands off the east coast of Africa, is predominantly rural and highly
dependent on external assistance. About 40% of GDP derives from agriculture, 50% from
trade and other services and the rest from manufacturing and construction. Agricultural
practices are undeveloped and marketing systems inadequate. Food production is insufficient
to meet local requirements and the country imports large quantities of rice and meat. The
manufacturing sector comprises primarily processing of export crops and a few small factories
supplying the domestic market. Tourism is still at an incipient stage. Major exports are
vanilla, cloves and perfume essences.
1.2          At independence in 1975, the country found itself with little infrastructure and
low education and health standards. Political turmoil marked its first fourteen years of
independence, culminating in the assassination of the President in 1989 and subsequent
departure of the foreign mercenaries who had been controlling the country. The elected
Governments which have followed have seen frequent cabinet reshuffles and an uncertain
political landscape. Since independence, with support from the international community,
economic and social infrastructure has improved. The country now has a fairly well-developed
road network, an international airport, and a deep-water port in Anjouan. However, economic
prospects remain constrained by the very small and segmented domestic market; the
geographical remoteness from major markets; and the limited natural resources.
A. Recent Economic Developments
1.3          Economic growth in the early 1980s was around 7% per year, but slowed to
under 1 % in the late 1980s due to a decline in the construction and public works that had led
the earlier spurt. Agricultural growth has continued at over 4% per year, but services have
declined due in large measure to the adverse impact of the political unrest on tourism. Export
earnings have been eroded due to declining terms-of-trade for vanilla and cloves, and exports
presently cover less than half import costs. The major import is rice.
1.4          Inflation has been low and steady, averaging less than 4% during 1987-91,
despite a large budget deficit. The Comorian franc is pegged to the French franc at FF1 =
CF50. Due to the appreciation of the French franc vis a vis the US dollar, the Comorian franc
has appreciated by about 60% in nominal terms (trade-weighted) and 25% in real terms in the
late 1980s with serious consequences on growth. Central Government debt totalled US$170
million in 1990. Despite the concessional nature of most lending, the debt service ratio is
about 19% and likely to remain at this level for several years. Due to a steady increase in the
wage bill in the late 1980s and the weakness of the revenue base, the overall budget deficit



2
(excluding grants) averaged over 20% of GDP in the late 1980s. Despite measures in 1990
and 1991 aimed at reducing the deficit, domestic arrears remain substantial.
1.5          Reform Program. Major structural reforms are being undertaken which are
oriented around better management of public finances, improvements in the climate for private
investment and employment, export diversification, better social sector planning and
management, and environmental protection. Reforms include improvements in the tax
collection system, reductions in civil service staffing and benefits, restructuring of the
management and financing of parastatal enterprises and the introduction of a new accounting
system for public and private enterprises. IDA's Macro-Economic Reform and Capacity
Building Credit (MERCAP), which became effective in December 1992, supports this reform
process. In 1991 the Government of Comoros reached an agreement with the IMF and cleared
arrears to the African Development Bank, opening the way for project lending to resume. A
plan for civil service reform has also been undertaken. On trade, the Government has acted to
reduce export taxes on vanilla, and to remove taxes and other levies on all other export crops.
Improvements in domestic competition in these markets has also been encouraged. Export
diversification is to be emphasized, especially into tourism, tropical fruits and agro-processing.
The resumption of relations with South Africa has improved prospects for tourism.
B. Conditions in the Social Sectors
1.6          Health, Population and Nutrition. The population of Comoros is relatively
young (46% under age 15) and growing at 3. 1% per year. Internal and external migration
rates are high. More than 40,000 Comorians live in France and a sizeable number in
neighboring African countries. The relatively underpopulated island of Moheli constitutes a
strong pole of attraction for migrants mainly from Anjouan.
1.7          Life expectancy is low at 56 years for women and 53.0 for men. Infant
mortality is estimated at about 90 per 1,000 live births and maternal mortality at nearly 500 per
100,000 pregnancies. Available data indicate a high incidence of preventable diseases. In
children, the leading causes of death are malaria, respiratory diseases, and diarrhea. Added to
intestinal parasites, skin diseases, and trauma, these diseases account for most health facility
visits by children under 5. Data from hospitals indicate high rates of obstetrical complications
associated with pregnancies that are too early, too closely spaced, or too late. Only a quarter
of births take place in health facilities. AIDS does not presently constitute a major public
health problem. HIV seroprevalence rates are below 1 per 1000 (0.07% in 1992). However,
given the extremely high prevalence of syphilis (19.2% among pregnant women in and around
Moroni) and other conventional sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), this picture is likely to
change with the anticipated improvement in international communications and expansion of
tourism. As of December 1992, 16 HIV cases have been diagnosed, mainly among foreigners.
1.8          At the national level, current population problems are characterized by a very
high density of population on arable land, high dependency burden, and a high level of
unemployment. Comoros is one of the most densely populated countries in Africa, with an
average population density of 205 persons per km2, or 398 persons per km2 of agricultural
land. Anjouan is the most densely populated island, with 429 inhabitants per km2, compared
with 243 in Grande Comore and 109 in Moheli. The proportion of children under 15 years of
age and adults age 60 and over (3%) suggests an age dependency ratio of 1.03 and a heavy



3
burden for the economically active population. Government efforts to raise primary school
enrollment are frustrated by the growing number of children aged 6 to 15. Unemployment is
serious and growing and efforts to curb it are annihilated by persistent unfavorable
demographic trends. Comoros' demography also has a strong negative impact on the
environment. Forest degradation, especially in Anjouan, and severe soil erosion are just some
of its many adverse environmental effects.
1.9          Family Planning (FP) services are available from most public sector facilities,
including health posts. Despite a doubling of the use of modern contraceptive methods during
the implementation of the Bank-financed Health and Population project (completed in 1991),
the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) remains at a low 4%. Unmet demand for
contraception is thought to be significant and there is now public consensus that the country is
fast becoming overpopulated. A Population Unit exists in the Planning Ministry, but it has
dealt primarily with the census.
1.10         The nutritional status of the population may be poor. One regional study
showed protido-caloric malnutrition to affect over 40% of children under 5 with severe
malnutrition as high as 10% in children under 5. Deficiencies of specific nutrients are also
common. Many pregnant women suffer from moderate to severe anemia, and iodine deficiency
disorders are highly prevalent in Anjouan. A diet low in protein, and traditions in which
certain foods are taboo, may contribute to high malnutrition rates in children.
1.11         Overall, coverage of the health system is dense by African standards with 83%
of the population living within one hour (walking distance) of a health facility. Health,
population and nutrition services are administered through the Ministry of Health and
Population. Service provision is currently organized through 20 health districts (14 operational
with six to become functional in the future), each covering between 25,000 and 100,000
people. The districts are comprised of one health center and a constellation of health posts,
dispensaries, and rural maternities. There are 15 health centers, and nearly 60 health posts and
rural maternities. Tertiary care is provided in 2 hospitals with a total bed strength of about
700. Outpatient care at the tertiary hospitals is heavily utilized. Secondary care is provided in
three surgical clinics with an average capacity of about 50 beds. A system of village
pharmacies provide drugs at low cost and supplements private sector pharmacies. 85% of
children are fully immunized. Public expenditures on health care are about 9% of public
expenditures, and about 2% of GDP, for a total of about US$7.50 per capita. The wage bill
comprises three fourths of the health budget.
1.12         Government policy since independence has stressed Primary Health Care
(PHC) and has accorded priority to the delivery of basic services to the rural areas. Comoros
has subscribed to the 1978 Alma-Alta Declaration, which prescribed a primary health care
approach with the aim of ensuring health care for all by the year 2000. With external donor
assistance, the actual orientation of the health services has generally mirrored the stated plans,
with recorded achievements especially in increasing vaccination rates.
1.13         Education. Although education statistics are around the sub-Saharan African
average, they were declining in the late 1980s and have only recently shown some
improvement. Nonetheless, adult illiteracy is high (estimated at 50%) and the absolute number
of illiterates may be growing as growth in literacy is estimated to be less than the population



4
growth rate. Gross primary school enrollment ratios were estimated at close to 90% in 1991,
after falling over the five preceding years. Net enrollment ratios are about 62%. Rates of
repetition are very high at about 35%. Pupil to teacher ratios in primary school are about
40:1. Double and triple shift classes are the norm, resulting in pupil-teacher contacts of 12-17
hours per week. Enrollment falls off in the secondary school years. The net participation rate
in lower secondary overall was only 7% in 1991/92 according to Government statistics. In
upper secondary it was less than 3%. As with most sub-Saharan African countries, salary
costs consume most of the budget of the Ministry of Education, with supplies and teaching
materials making up less than 3% of expenditures for primary education in 1991.
1.14          The Ministry of Education (MEN) employs about 1,800 teachers and 400
administrative staff. About 40% of public education expenditures goes to primary education,
and 11% to external scholarships for university education for 750 students. Education
consumes 22% of all public expenditures and about 4% of GDP.
1.15          Community Development. In Comoros, communities are traditionally very
active in organizing local development initiatives, in part due to weaknesses in the central
Government and in part due to cultural traditions. Lineage associations are very important in
the social structure. The society is generally matrilineal (group membership and status is
transmitted through the mother) and matrilocal (a newly married couple resides with the wife's
lineage). The exception is the island of Anjouan which is not matrilineal.
1.16          Village society is very cohesive and village associations have a long tradition
of investment in civic services, especially related to religion. Most villages have mosques,
village squares, and markets which have been erected by the local communities. "Notables"
play an important part in village society. Comorians abroad maintain their close affiliation
with their villages, and constitute an important source of investment capital for village projects.
Tlhis tightly-knit village structure is enhanced by the close physical proximity of houses --
villages are small urban units rather than dispersed farms; land is owned communally by the
village as well as by individuals.
1.17          Women in Comoros are in a relatively privileged position compared to other
countries. They are the owners of capital, especially real estate, and most are economically
active. Women's groups are active at the village level all over the country. However, women
bear the brunt of the country's poverty, as they spend long hours in collecting water and fuel,
have very high fertility rates with negative health consequences, leave school earlier, and make
up the majority of illiterates.
1.18          There also exist a number of other forms of association, including revolving
credit societies ("tontines") and mutual aid groups for particular tasks, as well as other
sporting, musical, and cultural associations. In general separate associations exist for men and
women. Most associations have little organizational experience and, in some cases, meager
financial resources. Government procedures require that associations register themselves with
the Government ("declared" organizations). Some, in particular those for education (such as
the parent-teacher associations), also receive Government support. There are a number of
federations of associations, in particular the Federation of Women's Associations of Comoros,
which has drawn support from UNDP; the National Coordination of Associations for
Development, which coordinates the activities of NGOs with local associations; ULANGA, an



5
environmental federation; and professional associations. International NGOs active in
Comoros include CARE, which implements a major environmental project for USAID on the
island of Anjouan as well as interventions in the health sector; CARITAS, which runs a
dispensary and school on Grande Comore and intends to expand activities to the other islands;
and CECI, which supports community development and environmental initiatives. Other
international NGOs active in Comoros include the International Committee of the Red
Cross/Red Crescent, the Boy Scouts, the Lions and Kiwanis Clubs, Handicap International,
Amici Raoul Follercao, Groupe de Service Volontaire and Amis du Pere Damien.
C. IDA's Assistance Strategy and Lessons Learned
1.19         Health. The World Bank-financed Health and Population Project (appraised
in 1982 and completed in 1991) was designed to help the Government develop a program to
slow population growth and strengthen the management and delivery of basic health services.
While many elements of the project had only minimal impact, the project did register some
progress towards its objectives. Among its most important achievements were: (i)
contribution to the creation of a network of family planning services accessible throughout the
country in almost all health facilities, helping to change the initially very negative attitudes of
political, religious, and traditional leaders toward family planning, and increasing the CPR to
an estimated 4% today; and (ii) establishing the National Autonomous Pharmacy of Comoros
(PNAC) which is now an autonomously managed operation which successfully operates on a
cost-recovery basis and has greatly increased the population's access to essential drugs through
its distribution systems which include cost-recovering village pharmacies. The reasons for the
adverse results of other components of the project are diverse. At the time of project design,
the Government was engaged in reorganizing its administration and economic system and the
Ministry of Health, which was only created in 1980, was still in the process of organizing
itself. Among the important problems were: (i) the MOH was not intimately involved in early
stages of project preparation and there was a lack of ownership of the project; (ii) the project
was a complex operation of six separate and unintegrated health sector components, each of
which was run by a separate national coordinator; (iii) the project was designed for a vertical
rather than an integrated approach to its activities, resulting in poor integration of these
activities into the mainstream activities of the MOH; and (iv) project preparation did not
provide the technical precision needed by a very new and weak MOH, (such as precision of
which health posts were to be constructed) which resulted in considerable delays and poor
implementation. Project design was generally too complex with excessive technical and
coordination/management expectations of the MOH given the early stages of its organizational
development.
1.20         The principal lessons to be drawn from the Health and Population project are
the following: (i) project preparation needs to directly involve the principal implementation
agency from the start and project design should be simple; (ii) activities should be integrated
in a horizontal rather than vertical manner within the operations of the MOH; (iii) technical
aspects of the project should be specified in detail and agreed by credit negotiations; (iv)
future projects should ensure that the implementing agencies have the capacity to develop these
technical aspects and technical assistance should be secured to ensure good performance; (v)
because of the Government's fiscal situation, popular participation and cost-recovery should be
explored to enhance sustainability prospects in future operations; and (vi) procurement
procedures should be specified and agreed during negotiations. The proposed project has



6
benefited from the above lessons by working closely with the Ministry of Health from the
outset, ensuring the specification of all technical details before negotiations, promoting cost
recovery and community involvement in health facilities, and establishing the CDSF as an
operational institution before negotiations.
1.21         Education. IDA has supported reforms in the education sector through two
Education Projects. The objective of the ongoing second project is to assist institutional
development in the Ministry of Education through: (i) improvements in education
administration and planning, mostly through technical assistance, training, fellowships and
study trips to other African countries; (ii) improvements in the quality of education at the
primary and lower secondary level, which consist of training for underqualified teachers,
training of advisers and principals and development of new teaching materials and guides; and
(iii) upgrading of technical/vocational training through provision of training and equipment.
This project has achieved some of its training goals, although progress has been slower than
anticipated due in part to the lack of a clear Government policy on the direction and form to be
taken by the education sector. This has been compounded by the reluctance of the Government
to redefine its support of secondary education and foreign scholarships, delaying progress on
financial aspects of the reform. The project has mainly encountered problems of management
and financial discipline. Frequent changes in high level officials have led to lack of knowledge
of the project and weak Government commitment. However, recent progress has been
achieved in the reorganization of the education sector staffing and administration under the
framework of the ongoing public service reform which is supported by MERCAP.
Complementary community-based efforts to increase community involvement in primary
schooling, including involvement in rehabilitation, maintenance, and equipping of primary
schools, would be highly beneficial to increasing the sustainability of Government and donor
efforts to improve the quality of primary schooling. The important lessons learned from these
two education projects include: (i) the importance of the continuity of staff working on project
implementation; (ii) the necessity of realistic expectations of the Government's ability to
provide financial contributions; and (iii) the importance of and need to include communities in
execution and planning of education sector activities. These lessons have been particularly
instructive for the development of the CDSF, which directly supports community activities.
II. HUMAN RESOURCES SECTOR ISSUES
A. Health Sector
2.1           Many constraints hinder the improvement of health and demographic
conditions in Comoros. Chief among these obstacles are weak delivery of health services at
the periphery level and weakness of population activities.
Weak delivery of health services
2.2           The delivery of health services, especially at the periphery level, remains weak
due to: (i) MOH inefficient organization and management; (ii) inadequate infrastructure; and
(iii) weaknesses of population and AIDS activities.



7
2.3           MOH IneMcient Organization and Management. The effectiveness of MOH
health activities is hindered by poor organization, lack of resources, and overcentralization of
the central administration. Medical regions and districts where most health care activities
should take place have only nominal power and few resources, being ill equipped in terms of
human, material, and financial resources and thus being unable to ensure the planning and
implementation of good quality PHC services within their boundaries. The current level of
centralization of the MOH and the heavy reliance on vertical programs preclude the
involvement of the health regions in the preparation, implementation, and evaluation of health
activities. For instance, medical doctors in charge of health centers are involved neither in the
Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) nor in the FP program, significantly lowering the
potential impact of these programs. Additionally, efficiency is reduced by the lack of referral
mechanisms and a lack of clarity as to the appropriate functions of each level of the health
system. There is no organized system to prevent patients from anarchically moving from one
level to another level of the health care system. The tendency for patients to bypass peripheral
facilities results in underutilization of an overly dense network of health posts and
overcrowding and inefficient use of hospitals. Secondary and tertiary health facilities are used
as PHC centers.
2.4           The curricula used by the MOH for training health personnel does not conform
to the skills needed for these workers to adequately perform their jobs. Both the level and mix
of their current skills are inadequate. Existing health workers, including those trained at the
National Public Health School (ENS), have not been adequately exposed to PHC and
community health activities. About 70% of MOH workers have no formal medical education.
A sizable proportion of nursing staff is made of untrained volunteers, particularly in peripheral
facilities, who often operate without adequate supervision to assure satisfactory quality. In
addition to problems in the quality of health workers, another manpower constraint results
from inadequate distribution of health workers throughout the country. Because of the lack of
proper management or an incentive system to attract workers and retain them in poorer rural
areas, there are wide disparities in the distribution of health personnel among individual
facilities, as well as a relative surplus of qualified nurses and midwives in hospitals and a
shortage of nurses in PHC facilities particularly in remote areas. The main hospital in Moroni,
El Maarouf, is disproportionately well staffed while rural health facilities are essentially staffed
by often poorly trained volunteers.
2.5           Health Inrrastructure Inadequacies. Efforts to develop population and health
activities in Comoros are also frustrated by the dilapidation and underequipment of health
facilities. Health facilities are often decrepit and poorly maintained, medical equipment is
generally minimal, and essential commodities are sometimes in desperately short supply. Lack
of maintenance and other support from the central ministry and an inadequate flow of supplies
and equipment impedes the operating efficiency of health facilities, especially at the peripheral
levels. There is also a tendency to design and establish health structures without proper
attention being paid to the size of the population to be served. The excessive number and size
of facilities contributes to high unit costs of services provided by the MOH and lowers the
efficiency of the Ministry, which in fact fails to provide adequate, if any services, at many of
these health facilities.
2.6           Weakness of Population and AIDS Activities. Although significantly
improved during the implementation of the Health and Population Project, FP services still



8
have obvious shortcomings and suffer from not being integrated into other MCH services.
While the Health and Population Project's approach was to train four well-motivated and
well-equipped mid-wives to promote and supervise FP activities and to improve conditions at
the facilities which provided these services, activities at which it was successful, much remains
to be done. Because this approach lacked the inclusion of physicians in the provision of family
planning services, the impact was less than it could have been. In addition, there is almost no
follow-up to motivate users to continue using contraceptives. The monitoring of clients,
supervision of services, and management of contraceptives still remain weak and supplies of
contraceptives, which to date are solely financed by UNFPA, are unpredictable and subject to
inventory breakdowns. These and other factors make it difficult for clients to get appropriate
support and treatment for their complaints and many get discouraged, failing to return to the
center for further supplies.
2.7          IEC activities in the family planning area, which have been financed by the
UNFPA and which relied in part on traditional communication networks such as mosques and
markets, were somewhat successful in changing the cultural and religious climate in Comoros.
At present, there is little religious opposition to the use of family planning for health and
socio-economic reasons. However, there is no clear understanding of the demographic need to
use family planning. In fact, current research indicates that many religious and traditional
leaders are in favor of family planning for health and socio-economic reasons but do not
understand the demographic need to limit population growth. In the last several years, IEC
activities have been diminished for family planning due to a lack of human, physical, and
financial resources.
2.8           Because the AIDS virus has not been a serious problem in Comoros to date,
most Government officials and the population have not begun to address the potential impact
this disease could have on Comoros. Comoros has had a National AIDS Control Program
since 1990 and it has carried out some IEC activities aimed mostly to reach leaders and young
people. However, although the program allocates about half of its resources to IEC, it does
not have enough resources to carry out the studies necessary to the development of an effective
IEC strategy. Trends experienced by other countries, (e.g. Djibouti and Cote d'Ivoire), which
previously had low AIDS but high STD prevalence rates as Comoros currently does and which
showed dramatic increases in AIDS over short periods of time, show that it will be crucial for
Comoros to intensify its IEC campaign and to extend its condom distribution program in order
to prevent a rapid contamination by HIV.
Ongoing Activities to Address these Issues.
2.9          In order to create a more efficient health delivery system, Comoros has
implemented a pilot program of autonomous administrative and financial management at one
health center, which has been highly successful. At the Mitsoudje health center, the
community participated in the construction of the center and is involved in its management,
financing and maintenance. Support has also been provided by UNDP, with technical support
from ASI, a French NGO. The center was authorized to charge fees, manage money received,
and was given greater autonomy over personnel.
2.10          At present, receipts cover not only the operating costs of the center, but also a
system of bonuses for the staff (tied to performance) as well as major and minor maintenance



9
and purchase of equipment. UNDP continues to defray the costs of the doctor, whose salary is
higher than that of doctors in the public service. Utilization of the center continues to rise
steadily in spite of the proximity of El Maarouf Hospital and the existence of fees for services.
The utilization rate has reached a level of one curative visit per year per person living in the
catchment area. A report issued in 1993 reviewing the pilot experience for the Government
confirms that the system is efficient from the point of view of motivation of personnel as well
as financial management and quality of services. A survey taken one year after the institution
of the fee for service system at Mitsoudje showed that average household spending on health
care in the catchment area had fallen after the institution of cost-recovery (and associated
improvements in quality and reliability). However, it notes the importance of significant
investments in training and modification according to local conditions.
2.11          The Government plans to generalize the principle of co-management with
communities and of cost-recovery of health facilities. It has issued a decree permitting
autonomous management of receipts in hospitals (December 1992) and, under the ongoing
public service reform will, in 1994, elaborate a new management, financial and administrative
system for health centers based on the model of the one in operation at Mitsoudje.
2.12          The Government of Comoros has recognized the need to expand the demand
for, as well as the quality and the quantity of, fertility and AIDS control services. With
substantial assistance from donors, the MOH continues to make commendable efforts to ensure
a steady supply of condoms, pills, injectables and other FP commodities and to improve the
country's capacity to prevent, diagnose, and treat STDs. However, the impact of these efforts
is limited by the advanced state of dilapidation of most MOH health facilities. To motivate
Comorians to change their behavior and to adopt practices which are conducive to better
health, programs addressing major public health problems each have an IEC component.
However, this approach has led to a fragmentation and unequal distribution of IEC resources,
as well as a lack of coordination and ineffective use of existing resources. Presently, although
family planning and AIDS prevention programs have more resources allocated to IEC than the
other public health programs, they still do not have enough resources individually to carry out
the necessary activities. The UNFPA IEC Population project focused on three types of
activities: (a) training of health personnel and community workers in family planning
interpersonal communication; (b) research on obstacles to the use of family planning; and (c)
material production. However, because of limited resources there were shortcomings in the
project, training was carried out only in project areas (ten villages), research sampling and
methodology were inadequate, and materials were not pretested. This lack of adequate
resources is likely to become worse as the budget of the next UNFPA IEC project, which
started in April 1993, is lower than that of the on-going project. In the AIDS area, IEC
activities have been limited and somewhat haphazard. They included one poster, some radio
spots and shows and some sensitization seminars aimed at opinion leaders and young people.
B. Education Sector
2.13          As in the health sector, performance in the education sector has been
compromised by the weakness of policy leadership and frequent personnel changes at senior
levels. Although some goals have been achieved in recent years, progress has been slower
than expected due in part to significant political pressures against certain aspects of the
education reform program. The Government's goals are: redistribution of expenditures in



10
favor of primary education; at the primary level, retraining of teachers, provision of teaching
materials and rehabilitation of school facilities; and at the lower secondary level, retraining of
teachers. The plans for the Public Expenditure Program for FYs 1992-95 indicate a gradual
fall in allocations to secondary level education, a real decline of 3% between 1991 and 1994.
An even sharper decline is predicted for foreign scholarships, falling by two thirds as the
number of new scholarships is reduced to zero by 1994. External aid is expected to make up
the difference with 100 new scholarships per year. However, pressures to increase admissions
into upper secondary and foreign scholarships have delayed the full implementation of a system
of financial controls. In addition, frequent strikes by primary teachers have undermined the
progress of reform at that level.
2.14          Because significant resources remain in the Second Education Project and
implementation has been extended to June 1994, the proposed Population and Human
Resources Development Project would not directly address education sector issues.
Additionally, there is a follow-up project planned in the education sector once the Second
Education Project is completed. The proposed Population and Human Resources Development
Project would affect education, however, by promoting complementary community
involvement in the rehabilitation, maintenance, and equipping of primary schools, with
technical and financial support from the proposed Community Development Support Fund.
C. Community Development
2.15          Local NGOs and community groups are responsive to local felt needs, but they
frequently lack an interface to the formal sector. However, the environment in which they
work is improving. The intolerance of former Government leaders for "modern" associations,
in particular the Scouts and other youth movements, has been replaced in recent years with a
more welcoming climate. Associative life has flourished and the Government now welcomes
the participation of community organizations in the elaboration and implementation of
development plans.
2.16          The Government believes that the development and support of community
organizations should play a vital role in socio-economic development. The contribution of
community organizations in assessing local needs and capabilities can form an important part
of social policy. Furthermore, community organizations may be best placed to implement
certain activities. In particular, the contribution of community groups can be critical to the
development of education and health institutions at a local level. After contributing their ideas
and financial resources to the construction/rehabilitation of a school or clinic, community
groups can play a crucial role in the sustainability of the institution by organizing and
maintaining a system of financial management and maintenance. This could include cost
sharing, contribution for key salaries (eg. teacher or nurse), maintenance responsibilities or
insurance/mutual aid.
2.17          The main outstanding issue remains the managerial and organizational
weakness of community organizations. There are significant needs for training in financial and
other forms of management; for technology transfer for technology-intensive projects (eg.
water supply or construction); and popularization of available funding sources and assistance
with project preparation. Communities in Comoros are generally in a position to provide



11
financial and in-kind contributions to projects, with increased ownership, sustainability and
impact resulting from this contribution.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives and Approach
3.1           Project Objectives. The overall goal of the project is to strengthen regional
and community involvement in population and human resource development through improving
the delivery of basic health services and stimulating complementary community activities. To
achieve this goal, the main objectives of the project are to: (i) support the establishment of
efficient health regions and other supportive services capable of providing comprehensive and
cost effective health care, including family planning services and AIDS prevention, through
community participation, self-management and cost recovery, and (ii) support complementary
community development initiatives to develop social infrastructure and grassroots participation
in small-scale productive activities.
3.2           Project Approach. To achieve the first objective, this project will selectively
continue past efforts initiated by the Government in the health sector with assistance from the
donor community. The population and health component of the project constitutes an integral
and essential part of a package which will be financed in parallel by the Comorian
Government, French aid (FAC), UNDP, WHO, and UNICEF. The Bank's primary role is to
rationalize and improve the efficiency of the MOH services, building upon successful
experiments with administrative autonomy of health facilities and community participation. To
achieve the second objective, a demand-driven social fund approach will be used to support
existing active community involvement in local development through a Community
Development Support Fund (CDSF). This approach will require the following: that the
request for support from the Human Resources Project to the community's sub-project comes
from the communities themselves; that the beneficiaries are directly involved in the planning,
execution, and evaluation of the sub-project; that beneficiaries contribute either in-kind or
financially to the sub-project's realization to assure sustainability; and that when necessary
and/or desired the community benefits from training to increase its capacity to develop sub-
project proposals as well as to implement and sustain sub-projects.
3.3           Because sub-projects which will be financed under the social fund are to be
demand-driven, precise and well-defined rules and criteria for sub-project selection have been
designed. To this end, a Manual of Procedures to regulate and facilitate CDSF operation has
been prepared and was tested by means of sub-projects financed under the PPF. The Manual
of Procedures is described in paragraphs 3.36-3.38, and is available in the project files. The
adoption of a Manual of Procedures satisfactory to IDA by the Central Coordinating
Committee (CCC) of CDSF is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit (para.
7.2(b)). The design of the CDSF is based upon lessons learned throughout the Bank and in the
Africa region, in particular as spelled out in the regional study, "Social Action Programs and
Social Funds: a Review of Experience in Design and Implementation," and "Socio-economic
Development Funds: A guideline for Design and Implementation." The project is also based
on experience gained from similar projects in Senegal, Mali, Zambia, Madagascar, and
Burundi among others. Principal among these lessons are the importance of promotion



12
activities; the need for a good system of management of financial data; the need for clear
objectives and project selection criteria; and the importance of training as a contribution to the
effectiveness of the administration of the fund as well as the success of sub-projects.
B. Project Description
3.4           The project will: (i) establish appropriate services capable of ensuring cost-
effective and sustainable provision of comprehensive and good quality health care, including
family planning services, AIDS prevention, and community participation in both management
and cost recovery, and (ii) support a social fund to finance community activities (including
education sector related activities and community level health activities).
Support to Improve Health Services
3.5           To improve MOH efficiency and ensure cost-effective and sustainable
provision of essential health services, this component of the project will have three sub-
components: (i) improving MOH management at the regional level; (ii) equipping and
rehabilitating regional hospitals and health centers; and (iii) promoting family planning and
AIDS control activities.
3.6           Improving Planning, Implementation, and Monitoring Capacity of
Regions. To strengthen and develop program planning, implementing and monitoring
capabilities at the regional level, the project will build and expand upon the experiences gained
from the above-mentioned Mitsoudje pilot program (para. 2.9). Overall management of the
three health regions (one for each island) will be the responsibility of Regional Health Teams
(RHT). Each RHT will be headed by a Regional Medical Officer (RMO) and will be charged
with supervising the implementation of health programs throughout the region, organizing on-
the-job training for regional health workers, and stimulating and streamlining comrnunity
participation. RHTs will have the responsibility and authority for administrative and technical
matters in their area, including the supervision of activities in hospitals and health centers
against established norms and monitorable performance indicators which are to be developed
during preparation and the first year of project implementation. To ensure good quality and
socially acceptable health and population services, special efforts will be made to stimulate
community participation in the planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of
population activities. At the health center level, the population will be encouraged to
participate by creating development committees at the village level, participating in the
rehabilitation of facilities and placing representatives on the management committees. The
health centers will be granted greater autonomy over the administration of personnel and the
levying and management of fees. This will be complemented by reforms in the regulatory
environment and in health personnel through the reform of the public service which is
supported by MERCAP, as well as by improvements in the allocation and funding of the health
sector budget which will be monitored both through the MERCAP credit and this project.
3.7           The project will also increase the productivity of regional personnel through a
series of training activities for various health workers. A list and description of the basic
training courses to be provided can be found in Annex 111. Special efforts will be made to
endow regions and health facilities with qualified planners and administrators capable of
properly carrying out the planning and the budgeting process required to efficiently utilize



13
human, material and financial resources. Service providers will receive appropriate training to
raise their skills in the delivery of preventive and curative care. The training will emphasize
the role of multi-purpose workers to dispense integrated basic health services (including FP
and STD management). 1/ Under the Health Region scheme, RHTs are expected to play a
pivotal and dual role in the development of health programs in their jurisdiction. As
physicians, they will have to spend part of their time working in health facilities to handle
difficult cases, particularly those identified by the auxiliary personnel at the health posts,
dispensaries and rural maternities. As managers, they will be responsible for ensuring the
provision of good quality services throughout their district. RMOs will receive adequate and
specific training to help them carry out the dual function. As has been done in the Mitsoudje
pilot, an appropriate incentive system will be established to both attract and retain health
workers, particularly into underserved areas, as well as to improve staff performance. This
will include regular and adequate supervision and may include incentives such as provision of
transportation and housing facilities particularly for health cadres working in remote areas.
3.8            To ensure that FP services are integrated into the overall package of services
provided by the health centers and are successful, the project will provide logistical support for
the incremental supervision visits which will focus on: integration of FP into the MCH
package, practical application of approved service norms, and the supply and procurement of
contraceptives. Mechanisms will also be established to follow up on acceptors, motivate users
to continue using contraceptives and accurately record the number of acceptors, users and
couple-years of protection (CYPs). To prevent shortages of FP commodities, the project will
finance a contingency fund to assume the regular supply of contraceptives.
3.9            Complementary and Prerequisite Actions Required at the Central Level. In
order for health regions to effectively carry out the above program, several actions need to be
undertaken at the central MOH level to enable them to provide adequate technical and
operational support to the regional staff who implement the vast majority of activities. To
ensure proper administration of the project, a Project Office will be established within the
MOH Directorate General for health facilities. Additionally, MOH's central Directorates,
particularly the Directorate of Health Education (DHI) and the Directorate of Pharmaceutical
Inspection (DPI) will be strengthened. The Project Office will be headed by a Unit Chief who
will report to the Director General. The Project Office will be responsible for the
administrative task of overseeing the implementation of the component. This unit will provide
assistance to help the relevant MOH units and RHTs develop and/or improve the following:
(i) appropriate sector norms, rules, regulations and standards, including PHC therapeutic
protocols, a Pharmaceutical Code, and MOH administrative and financial procedures; (ii)
training modules for MOH staff based on agreed standards and functions to be performed by
each category of personnel, as well as organizing training for RMOs in collaboration with the
ENS; and (iii) a monitoring and evaluation system for the health regions which would assess
the results of efforts invested in the sector. Terms of reference for the technical assistance
(most of which will be local and regional) needed to aid the MOH in establishing systems and
I/     With regard to FP, programs will be developed to train and explicitly and systematicaUy involve
physicians (particularly Regional Medical Officers), nurses, auxiliary nurses, and pharmacists in the provision of FP
services. Training modules will be developed and implemented in the management of FP services, communication,
contraceptive technology, integration of FP and MCH services, and outreach programs.



14
procedures for improving MOH efficiency at central level are listed in Annex III. Funds will
also be made available to finance technical assistance to aid the Government in improving its
health information system (including public expenditure programming and resource
management as well as disease trends) and improving the logistics system for the procurement
and flow of supplies and equipment to districts.
3.10          Equipment and Rehabilitation of Health Facilities. Given the fact that the
dilapidated physical state of the public health care facilities contributes to their low
performances, selected priority MOH facilities will be partially rehabilitated and equipped so
as to enable them to effectively carry out their normative functions. The project will finance
partial rehabilitation, including waste disposal and sanitary water supply, equipment, technical
assistance and training of health personnel, for a total amount estimated at US$3.4 million.
For health centers to qualify for rehabilitation, full community involvement will be required.
The CDSF will work with the MOH, mobilizing communities to participate and undertake part
of the rehabilitation, as well as assure community commitment to maintenance and management
of these facilities. As a condition of negotiations, preliminary architectural plans, as well as
time tables for rehabilitation of the designated health facilities, and a preliminary list of
medical equipment, grouped by lot for bids were finalized and submitted to IDA (para.7. 1(b)).
3.11          Expanding and Improving Family Planning and AIDS Control Activities.
The project will support activities to improve the availability and quality of fertility and AIDS
control services, as well as the demand for these services. During preparation and the first
year of the project three studies will be conducted. One study using qualitative techniques will
assess the factors which influence decisions on family size and the underlying causes behind
the low demand for FP services and low rate of continuity among FP users. A second study
will collect data on knowledge, attitudes and practices with regard to sexuality and AIDS in
Comoros. A third study will investigate what are the credible sources of health and family
planning information for Comorians and what are the best channels to use for each target
group. The three studies will help to provide first hand information to assist in the
improvement and design of multi-media, well-targeted IEC strategies and the formulation of
other population and AIDS activities. Based on the findings of these studies and on the results
of the beneficiary assessment study to be undertaken during the first year of the project,
appropriate IEC messages will be produced and disseminated according to the selected
strategies and any corrective operational and managerial measures will be adopted.
3.12          In the field of family planning, four priority groups will be targeted by
information, education and communication activities, namely, religious and political leaders;
women aged 15 to 49; men who are married to women of reproductive age; and young people.
Support will be given to both modern and traditional media. In stimulating the demand for FP,
person-to-person education will be combined with an enlarged mass communication effort
(seminars, radio programs, theater, mobile video, etc.). A similar approach will be used for
AIDS IEC activities which will be targeted mostly to young people and to opinion leaders.
Over the life of the project, group meetings will be held to guarantee social acceptance and
support. As mobilizing religious leaders is critical in addressing these issues in Comoros,
conferences for religious and other social leaders would be held annually on each island.
Representatives of women's and youth groups would be invited. Leaders of community
organizations will be trained in interpersonal communication and community mobilization with
particular reference to FP and AIDS and will be used as "relays" to disseminate FP and AIDS



15
messages. Other "relays" who will be trained will be journalists for whom four seminars will
be held. The project would also finance two study tours so that Comorians can learn from
other countries' experience. Two months of technical assistance will be provided for specific
tasks as required (Terms of Reference are in Annex III). Access to good quality family
planning and AIDS control services will be expanded through the rehabilitation of health
facilities and the adequate training and supervision of health workers. Special attention will be
given to ensure regular supplies of commodities required to perform fertility and AIDS control
activities, including contraceptives, antibiotics and lab reagents in all health facilities. To
improve the availability and quality of fertility and AIDS control services, the project will
support the following: (a) equipping 20 laboratories to improve their diagnostic capacities; (b)
training and supervising service providers and lab technicians; (c) ensuring regular supply of
commodities required to carry out fertility and AIDS control activities; and (d) monitoring the
impact of these control activities.
3.13          Policy Measures. In addition to technical support for project implementation,
the Government has provided IDA with a health policy letter which includes the policy
measures described below:
3.14          The letter outlines the programs and intentions of the Government in the health
sector. It recapitulates the National Health Development Plan of 1991, which identifies the
priority programs, which are (a) the promotion, through information, education and
communications, of healthy lifestyles and behaviors; (b) the promotion of maternal and child
health, including pre- and peri-natal care, vaccinations and family planning; (c) efforts against
endemic diseases, including malaria, diarrheal diseases and AIDS; and (d) the supply of
essential medicines, notably through the development of village pharmacies. The letter stresses
the importance of population policy and family planning goals both in the health sector and in
the national economic agenda.
3.15          The letter continues by describing the reforms of the system of administration
and financing of health facilities, in line with the overall reform of the public service taking
place under the mantle of the Structural Adjustment Program. Specifically, the reforms
envisage that the public system of health care will be simplified to focus on health centers and
hospitals and these public health facilities will be endowed with new powers of financial and
administrative management, including a universal principle of cost recovery. Improved central
services of IEC, supervision/inspection and training will support the public health activities of
these more independent facilities. The use of mobile teams for specific campaigns will be
reduced and replaced with facility-level health teams with an integrated and diversified mandate
and composition. The central functions of monitoring, training and program management will
be decentralized to the regional level (one region per island). The staffing will be reoriented in
favor of more qualified workers with a better geographical distribution.
3.16          This new arrangement will be codified in a set of new regulations and
administrative procedures under development in 1993. These regulations define the
involvement of communities in the management of health centers and their representation in the
governing boards of hospitals. They define the parameters under which cost-recovery can take
place, and the mechanisms by which the funds so generated are managed (all funds are retained
at the facility level). They also define the relationships of facility management to civil servants
and to the public service, including guidelines for performance-related incentives at the facility



16
level (incentives at the regional and central levels will be addressed as the system develops).
Finally, they define the roles and responsibilities of the various levels (Central, Regional and
facility) for maintaining public health objectives, including training, supervision and IEC.
3.17          At the same time, with the Ministry of Finance, the MOH is putting together a
budgeting process which will lead to more rational funding of the health sector. By December
31, 1994, the Ministry of Health will, with the Ministry of Finance, produce a public
expenditure program to cover 1995-97 and review it annually with IDA; this will be a
rationalized budget responsive to program needs. The involvement of the Ministry of Finance
will ensure that the program is feasible from a budgetary perspective. During negotiations
assurances were given by the Government that the budget for the MOH will be credited at a
level which maintains the 1992 level of real expenditure, including at least 20% of the total in
non-salary funding, that the budget will be reviewed annually with IDA, and that the budget
for the current and subsequent fiscal years will be reviewed annually with IDA  (para. 7.1(c)),
starting with the 1995 budget.
3.18          Under the project, IDA will finance the rehabilitation and equipping of three
regional offices, and two hospitals (Hombo and Fomboni). The project will also provide funds
for the rehabilitation and equipping of health centers, the selection and scale of which to be
decided on the basis of community mobilization and participation. The project will finance the
production of training modules and in-service training for health planners and administrators,
regional medical officers, medical doctors, nurses and midwives, and technicians. The project
will also provide for a limited number of study tours and analytical studies. Technical
assistance to the Project Office in the MOH will also be provided for by the project.
3.19          Sustainability of Regional Health Program. The proposed project will lay
the groundwork for the sustainability of the health system of the Governmnent of Comoros,
which is weak due to the current large Government deficit and weak institutional capacity.
The project aims to enhance sustainability of health activities through improvement of health
sector management, human resource development, health financing, improved STD/FP
services, and health facility rehabilitation. This will build upon successful pilot programs
which increase beneficiary participation in both management and financing of health services.
The operational sustainability of the project will be achieved by relying on the involvement of
experienced private firms/NGOs and local communities to implement the various project
components.
3.20          Recurrent cost implications of the health component. The reforms to be
undertaken under the project are budget neutral. There will be no new facilities constructed
and staffing will conform to the public sector rationalization under way for the Government
overall. For the Ministry of Health, this reform implies no net change in the number of people
employed, but there will be a shift towards more qualified employees. The slight rise in the
wage bill will be offset by a mild reduction in public spending on non-salary items, which will
be increasingly covered by cost-recovery. In order to fully reflect the Government's
commitments and obligations, the project cost tables indicate the Government's contribution of
staff and supplies, without which the rehabilitated facilities cannot function. The only
incremental recurrent cost implication of the health component is the operating cost of the
Project Office. As the Project Office's purpose is to supervise administration of project



17
activities (procurement, disbursement, etc..), it is not expected to continue after the end of the
project.
3.21          A new institutional structure for the health sector has been was signed and is
expected to be implemented in early 1994. This will have only a slight and progressive effect
on the health sector wage bill, which is covered by reallocations from other sectors, under the
overall adjustment program, and is not a consequence of this project. Non-salary costs at the
health center level, while woefully inadequate, will be shifted in large measure to the
communities through cost-recovery (fee for service) and community responsibilization. Some
of these savings will be redeployed to the hospital level, and the hospitals will also mobilize
resources through cost recovery. Cost recovery already fully pays for medications, and the
operating costs of laboratories, radiology services and dentistry. It is conceivable that these
adjustments would result in a decrease in the recurrent budget of the Ministry of Health.
However, this does not imply a decrease in expenditures, which have historically been well
below the budget.
3.22          In 1994, the Ministry of Health will issue a Public Expenditure Program
(PEP) to cover the years 1995-97, the execution of which will be reviewed jointly by the
Government and IDA annually and at the mid-term review as agreed during negotiations (para.
7.1(i)). The PEP will cover investment and recurrent expenditure at the facility level, and will
conform to the Government's structural adjustment plan as well as serving the aims of the
reform of the health sector. It will take into account recurrent cost implications of investment
projects.
3.23          The goal of the PEP is to provide a realistic budget that will be followed, and
in which facilities, suppliers and contractors can have faith. In the past, budget allocations
have been reasonable, but actual payments have lagged far behind, with commitments being
around two-thirds of allocations for non-salaries expenditures in 1989-92 and actual payments
lower still. The process has begun with the development of the Public Investment Program in
1992. The PEP would analyze actual payments, reducing highly fungible categories (fuels,
food) and aiming for full funding of all allocations.
3.24          The criteria for budget allocation in the health sector have been simplified
by the proposed reforms of the public health system. On the investment side, no new
facilities are to be built in the immediate future (before at least the year 2000). Investments are
in rehabilitation, equipment and human capital, and these are limited largely by the availability
of donor funds. On the recurrent side, the proposed reforms would significantly reduce non-
salary expenditures at the lower levels (health centers and health posts) as these will become
the responsibility of the community and the beneficiaries. At present the distribution of non-
salary expenses is about 30% to central functions and 70% to hospitals, both of which are very
underfunded. The new structure of the health system will require increased and improved
performance by the center. At the same time, the need for increases in funding of recurrent
costs for hospitals remains commanding. This distribution of allocations between
administration and hospitals is therefore likely to remain much the same. The following
agreements have been reached with the Government: (i) the budget executed in each year of the
project will be no less than the commitments for 1992 in real terms (CF800 million); (ii) the
budget executed in each year of the project will contain no less than 20% will be allocated to
non-salary expenditures; (iii) medical evacuation costs, which are currently disproportionately



18
high (CF36 million in 1992), will be reduced as agreed under the MERCAP program (CF20
million in 1993); and (iv) the budgets for health facilities will be allocated on the basis of
contracts between the MOH and the facilities starting in 1995. These agreements are reflected
in the letter of health policy.
The Community Development Support Fund
3.25          The CDSF is designed to encourage community participation in sustainable
economic development, support and develop the capacity of communities and non-Government
organizations, and complement sectoral development strategies, especially in the education and
health sectors. It will bring additional financing and technical support to the realization of
community projects. Together the activities funded by the project will have a synergistic effect
on improving human resources, promoting overall economic development, and alleviating
poverty. While the social fund will be demand-driven, i.e. sub-project ideas will come from
the communities themselves, and the criteria which have been developed to screen and evaluate
the projects will determine which sub-projects are to be funded by the CDSF (see para. 3.31),
the primary focus is expected to be on the following types of activities: rehabilitation of basic
infrastructure, especially primary schools and water supply; income generating activities;
activities which promote the well-being and development of women; and training of
communities and groups in appropriate technologies and in resource and project development
and management. As mentioned above, the selection of sub-projects will be subject to a set of
precise criteria in the Manual of Procedures which was drafted and discussed during project
preparation, reviewed during appraisal, and was finalized during negotiations (para. 7.1(a)).
3.26          Rehabilitation of basic infrastructure. The vast majority of sub-projects to
bp financed under this category are expected to be the rehabilitation of essential services
(rimary schools, water supply, health posts), but could also include the rehabilitation of
feeder roads, bridges, markets, and food storage facilities. In the case of rehabilitation of
essential infrastructure, project support will be possible if communities express these as their
priority needs, contribute to the costs of project implementation, and develop a viable
maintenance scheme. Already there have been over 20 requests for sub-projects in the
rehabilitation of primary schools, which are being refined, and about a dozen in water supply.
(A list of sub-project requests which have been received to date and are expected to be
completed during the first year of project implementation is listed in Annex I). The NGO
CARITAS is also working with communities in the area of primary health care and is
responding to several communities interested in submitting proposals for the rehabilitation of
health posts. Although sub-projects proposals have not been submitted to date for the
rehabilitation of feeder roads and bridges, the project is open to financing these infrastructures
when they constitute missing links for income generating activities. Labor intensive work will
be preferred whenever proven as technically and economically efficient and insofar as it
generates employment opportunities. In coordination with the Ministry of Health, the CDSF
will help to mobilize and train communities for their participation in the rehabilitation and
management of health facilities, funds for which are provided under the health component of
the project.
3.27          Income generating activities. The project will encourage the poor to launch
small-scale, viable, productive activities in sectors where a demand can be identified or
expected and which have durable real income gains. The project will assist implementing



19
agencies to organize groups, particularly women's groups, to undertake sub-projects. The
project will finance specific vocational training and basic management, accounting, and
marketing support. Because the creation and expansion of small businesses is critical to the
growth of the Comorian economy, this is an important element of the project. However, the
CDSF will enter this field very cautiously for the first two years of its operation because
experience with cooperative enterprises is small. For this reason, for the first two years of
CDSF operation, the project will work closely with a UNDP/ILO project which already has
some experience in lending working capital to micro-enterprises. During the first phase of two
years, the CDSF will complement the UNDP/ILO's activities by providing, where necessary,
training and technical assistance in work planning, supervision, and production. Support will
also be given where needed to the expected hundred small contractors who will have contracts
making furniture for the CDSF-funded rehabilitation projects. The CDSF will not extend
credit. After two years, an evaluation will be carried out by the CDSF to draw on the
experience and make proposals to launch the second phase of the program.
3.28          Training. As the CDSF is aimed at promoting self-reliant, sustainable socio-
economic development of rural communities, by increasing the local institutional capacity for
development planning and implementation, training would play a crucial role in helping
communities attain the proposed targets. Training is expected to be both supply and demand
driven. It is foreseen that communities will need training in organizing, developing sub-
projects, and managing the implementation and maintenance of them. The estimated training
plan (Annex III) is expected to involve approximately 1800 members of the Community Pilot
Committees which will be involved in micro-project execution (see para. 5.15), 180 book-
keepers, 600 masons, 180 carpenters, 360 school furniture makers, 100 fitters and plumbers,
270 painters, and 2000 rural women in the three islands. Training activities will be
coordinated by the Information and Training Unit. Staff and technical assistants would actively
participate in training. Seminars in communication and training methods for technical skills in
production will be organized with a view to strengthening the training corps. Training for
managers at both central and local level will provided by consultants from the NGO CECI,
which supports management development for the component. Training for the development of
women will be carried out by CARITAS' professional staff. Basic skills training for workers
will be provided on-the-job by mobile teams composed of job site supervisors, foremen, and
part-time teachers hired under the project. Training will also be provided by the private sector
or other implementing agencies, especially for sub-projects which request specific training.
3.29         Promotion of women. The women of Comoros are in general economically
active and interested participants in the development process. This project seeks to support
and further develop this participation of women. The CDSF approaches women's issues
through two different means: special programs for women, and inclusion of women in all the
regular activities of the CDSF. In the first instance, it offers a program of training for rural
women in the areas of literacy, family planning, nutrition, mother and child health, and income
generating activities. Through this program, women who are already active in their
communities will also be given special coaching to assist them in project formulation and
community organization, helping them to make proposals to the CDSF and other donors. The
other means is through the general program of projects, where the CDSF will target activities
that are mostly carried out by women (child care), provide disproportionate benefits to women
(education, nutrition, water supply etc.), or include women as equal partners (all village



20
residents must be members of the community committee). Projects will be monitored and care
will be taken to maintain a high percentage of projects with significant benefits to women.
3.30          Institutional Structure. The overall structure of the CDSF is a Central
Coordination Committee (CCC), a National Executive Secretariat (NES), Regional Committees
(RC), Regional Executive Secretariats (RES), and Pilot Committees (PC). The CCC acts as
the Board of Directors for the CDSF, setting overall policies at the central level, while the
Regional Committees are the oversight and policy organizations at the local level. The
Executive Secretariats are the administrative/executing organizations which deal with the day-
to-day operations of the CDSF. The PCs are the community groups which in most cases will
be responsible for implementation of projects at the community level. Detailed division of
labor between the groups is presented in Chapter V under Project Management (para. 5.9).
3.31          Sub-Project Selection Criteria. Selection of sub-projects will take into
account a series of criteria, including: (i) formation of a community pilot committeel/
responsible for the overall management of the CDSF financed sub-project; (ii) assurances were
obtained during negotiations that the community's contribution would be not less than 20% of
the total cost of each sub-project (although in the case of communities annually identified as the
poorest this could fall to 15%); (iii) an assessment of cost effectiveness as reflected in the cost
per beneficiary; (iv) for sub-projects involving construction, strict observation of rules applied
in environment protection (i.e. ban on the use of corals and beach sand); (v) adherence to
norms established by technical ministries, and consistency with the sector strategies and
programs; (vi) cost of sub-projects which are not beyond the capacity of community
contribution or user charges; and (vii) provision for maintenance of infrastructure and/or
sustainability of sub-project operation beyond the project period, including recovery of
operating costs where appropriate; to this end, for many types of sub-projects, the CDSF
would require that communities provide evidence of their ability and willingness to ensure
appropriate maintenance of the sub-project beyond the period of CDSF assistance as one of the
criteria of sub-project selection. In determining the costs of sub-projects, the CDSF would
take into account the imputed value of the contribution (in kind and in cash) to be made by the
beneficiary community, as well as all financial costs.
Sub-Project Cycle
3.32          Promotion and Identification. An intensive IEC campaign has taken place on
all three islands during preparation of the project and more than 70 community committees
have been established with the support of the RESs. These intensive campaigns will continue
periodically, although the RES on each island will continuously fulfill this promotion function,
making frequent field visits to disseminate information about the opportunities offered by the
project, as well as to explain to potential beneficiaries the approach, objectives, and procedures
of the project. For the periodic intensive IEC campaigns innovative techniques such as media
coverage and competitions will take place to encourage individuals and organized groups to
formulate projects. To fulfill their function, the RESs will: (i) liaise with local constituencies
and keep in contact with representatives of various organizations working at the local level in
order to be ready to identify new projects and to help their designers to put them into an
1/     Or availability of an implementing agency.



21
articulated manner, and (ii) collect sub-project requests. Promotion efforts will be intensified
in areas where poverty is known to be widespread and especially severe. Specialists in social
marketing and information, education and communication will be called upon to help design
and launch the more intensive campaigns.
3.33          Appraisal Procedures. Each initial sub-project request is to be logged in by
the RES and classified according to the type of activities it belongs to. Then the following
steps are taken: (i) the project is pre-sorted and declared eligible on the basis of the category of
activity, the project amount, the target population, and the sponsor agency; (ii) a field visit is
organized; (iii) all criteria are reviewed and the budget analyzed. If the sub-project is judged
appraisable, it is then transmitted to the relevant Regional Technical Department which has up
to two weeks to object to or comment upon the proposal;I/ and (iv) depending on sub-project
amount, final approval of grants is decided either by the Regional sub-project committee or the
NES. At each step there is a possibility to re-enter the cycle, with better, updated, or more
complete information. The methodology to be used in the appraisal of each type of sub-project
is described in detail in a Manual of Procedures containing detailed selection criteria for each
type of sub-project.
3.34          Sub-project Execution. Once sub-projects are approved, their implementation
is the responsibility of either a pilot committee or an implementing agency. Pilot committees
will implement most infrastructure sub-projects and will plan and organize the work, procure
goods and contracts for works, and make sure that the beneficiaries participate and contribute
as planned. Procurement procedures must follow IDA guidelines and are detailed in the
Manual of Procedures of the CDSF. All payments to suppliers, small contractors and artisans,
however, will be made directly by the CDSF within the amounts of the grants for the sub-
projects. Where needed, RES staff will assist pilot comrnittees managing the implementation
of sub-projects through strong supervision.
3.35          Income-generating activities and training activities, as well as some basic
infrastructure sub-projects concerning several villages (for which there is no pilot committee)
will be carried out by implementing agencies (NGOs, professional associations, or other non-
profit organizations and technical assistance projects), will also follow the CDSF Manual of
Procedures for procurement in particular. The proceeds of the grants will be made available
by the CDSF to the implementing agencies in accordance with a disbursement schedule
included in the financing agreement between the CDSF and the Implementing Agency, which
will be responsible for paying their own suppliers and contractors and be subject to audit by
the CDSF's auditors. No credit will be given under the project. The project will work with
the on-going UNDP/ILO credit project on a complementary basis.
3.36          Manual of Procedures. A detailed Manual of Procedures has been developed
for the CDSF. The Manual of Procedures is for daily use by the CDSF Administration. It
guides all decisions regarding the administrative and financial management of the CDSF itself
as well as the selection, appraisal, supervision and evaluation of sub-projects. It defines the

will either be redesigned or abandoned.

institution and its mandates, and spells out the responsibilities and administrative arrangements
for the CDSF, its three regional secretariats and its community-level interactions.
3.37          The Manual describes the general types of subprojects eligible for financing,
and the criteria for selection, as explained in para 3.31. It details the administrative steps by
which the CDSF would receive, evaluate, approve, supervise and post-evaluate a project,
including guidelines for procurement consistent with the World Bank's guidelines. It details
the financial and auditing requirements for the CDSF Administration as well as for sub-
projects. It describes the recruitment and management of CDSF personnel in an appendix.
3.38          A dozen annexes are attached to the Manual of Procedures. These annexes
also form an integral part of the daily routine of the CDSF, as they give the legal structure for
the organization and a number of sample documents encountered frequently by CDSF staff.
The first two annexes give a copy of the laws creating the CDSF and defining its organization
and operation. Sample documents include an application for membership in the CDSF for a
Pilot Committee; a model statute of association for a Community Development Association;
model meeting minutes; a model request for official recognition of a Pilot Committee; a sub-
project application form; a model convention between the CDSF and the Pilot Committee; a
model protocol of agreement between the CDSF and an executing agency (such as an NGO);
and a sub-project supervision form. In addition annexes include procedures for procurement of
works and equipment; and standard bidding documents.
3.39          Economic Rationale of CDSF. The economic rationale for the investment
(non-income-generating) activities that it funds are principally: (i) it serves identified needs
which are perceived by the community rather than being centrally-planned; (ii) it raises
additional local resources for self-defined and targeted grass-roots development efforts; (iii) it
assures the recurrent costs of the operations, which, relative to traditional investments,
presents a saving both in the Government's recurrent budget and in the cost of later
rehabilitation of the dilapidated investment; (iv) in some cases, it provides investments that
would be impossible otherwise (due to the remoteness of the village, for instance); (v) usually
there is a cost saving over centrally planned investments, especially for labor; and (vi)
community supervision and management reduces leakages, and in many cases will increase
quality. Intangible benefits include the empowerment and ownership of communities; their
contact with the outside world and the Government; the empowerment of youth and especially
young women; and tremendous capacity building and training at the community level which
could then better harness local resources in the future.
3.40          Sustainability of CDSF. There are two levels of sustainability relevant to the
CDSF: sustainability of the sub-projects financed, and sustainability of the institution itself.
Concerning the former, the Manual of Procedures stipulates that before any sub-project can be
financed by the CDSF, its sustainability after CDSF intervention must be assured. To achieve
this, each sub-project must include a plan for community participation in financing,
implementing, and maintaining the activity after sub-project support is completed. The
assessment of this plan is an integral part of the appraisal of the sub-project. Without
acceptable plans for the sub-project's sustainability, it will not be supported by the CDSF.
The question of whether the CDSF institution itself should be sustainable is one to be answered
during the mid-term review of the project. If the CDSF is successful at efficiently helping
communities to implement sub-projects which have a proven track record at improving the



23
living standards of the population and generating bottom-up development, then, as experience
has shown, these types of funds have no problem in raising the money from external donors,
organizations, and the Government to continue their work. If it is determined at mid-term
review that needs still exist at the community level and operations look successful enough to
merit continuation of the CDSF after the life of the project, a financing advisor will be
recruited to be in charge of fund-raising for the CDSF to assure its sustainability after the end
of project. If at the end of project execution it is decided to dismantle the CDSF, the benefits
of the sub-projects and training undertaken during project execution will continue.
3.41          Environmental Effects of the Project. Although this is illegal, sea-sand or
ground coral is often used in construction in Comoros. During project preparation, a specialist
in tropical construction worked with the Comorians to develop several different prototype
construction techniques which use local materials other than sand and coral (crushed volcanic
rock for instance) which have been successfully shown to minimize negative environmental
impact. These methods are being tested on sub-projects during preparation, for instance in the
rehabilitation of school classrooms, to determine their quality, durability, cost-effectiveness,
ease of use, and acceptability by local communities. If communities are found to be using any
environmentally damaging materials, CDSF financing will stop immediately for that sub-
project. Close supervision is facilitated by the regional offices of the CDSF. To minimize
environmental risks in the health component, the project will also finance the development of
appropriate waste disposal and sanitary facilities.
IV. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
4.1           The total cost of the project is US$16.0 million net of taxes and duties in
August 1993 prices. The Health component accounts for US$7.8 million, the Community
Development Support Fund for US$7.9 million and the PPF for US$0.4 million. Price
contingencies have been calculated at 1.9, 2.7, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5% for foreign expenditures and at
4% for local expenditures, for the five years of project implementation starting in 1994. There
are no physical contingencies, because the scale and number of health centers to be
rehabilitated as well as the scale and number of sub-projects of the CDSF will be a function of
the amounts allocated in the respective categories of expenditure. The project cost summary
by component and by category of expenditure are in Tables 4.1 and 4.2 below. These costs
are based on estimates provided by MOH and CDSF with assistance from a consulting firm.
The appraisal mission reviewed these costs in collaboration with the entities which will be in
charge of executing the various components. The detailed costs of the project are shown in
Annex IV.
4.2           The IDA contribution is US$13.0 million, of which US$6.0 million will be
allocated to the health component and $7.0 million to the CSDF. The project will be financed
by IDA, the Government, and local communities. During negotiations, it was agreed that the
contribution of the communities to the CDSF has been set at a minimum of 20%, except for
the poorest communities in which case the contribution would fall to 15% (para. 7.1 (k)). To
allow for the CDSF to put priority on the poorest communities, the cost tables reflect an
average contribution by communities of 16%. The costs shown for the health component do
not reflect the Government's contribution to the salaries of staff working part time on the



24
project, materials, office space and other incidental contributions. However, they do reflect
the Government's commitment to provide adequate staffing and supplies to rehabilitated
facilities.

4.3             The cost for rehabilitation of selected sites was estimated from 40 to 60%  of
the cost of new construction; depending the status of the facility this results in costs of US$220
to US$330 per m2. Training abroad was estimated at US$5,000 per person/year and for local
training US$600 per person/month. Local salaries and operating expenses were estimated
using UNDP standards.
4.4             Customs duties and taxes. All items imported for the purpose of executing
this project as well as the major imported items purchased locally will be exempt from direct
customs duties and taxes, in line with the standard practice of the Government.

4.5            IDA is the sole source of foreign funding for the project. The Government
will cover the salaries of the civil servants involved in the project, including those on the
Project Office staff, and the operating costs of the facilities which are already in the budget of
the MOH for a total estimated at about US$2 million. The contribution of communities in
CDSF sub-projects would be a minimum of 20% except for the poorest communities, and is
calculated at 16% of the sub-projects financing for a total estimated at about US$1 million.
Recurrent costs for the health component indicate the Government's commitment to provide a
full complement of staff and supplies to the rehabilitated facilities; however, the reforms
proposed for the health sector and supported by this project are budget neutral. The only
incremental recurrent cost associated with the health component is the cost of the project
office, which is a temporary cost. Maintenance of facilities rehabilitated under either
component will be assured by the local communities and does not therefore have budget
implications either. Table 4.3 below shows the proposed allocation of the IDA credit by
disbursement category.

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Project Preparation
5.1          Health Program. A team of international consultants worked out the health
component with the MOH Directorate General. Very close contact has also been maintained
with all donors involved--UNDP, WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, the French Cooperation, etc.--
and most preparation missions have been joint with these donors. Under the MERCAP, the
MOH is engaged in major reforms of its personnel and administration, complementary to the
project's goals. Regulations redefining the roles and powers of health facilities and
communities with regard to financial and administrative management are under preparation and
their application to the facilities to be rehabilitated under the project is a condition of
disbursement for civil works (para. 7.3(b)), as is implementation of the new organisational
chart in the facilities to be rehabilitated.
5.2          Community Development Support Fund. Considerable work has been
undertaken on the preparation of the CDSF. Extensive IEC campaigns have been undertaken
by the National Preparation Committee on each of the three islands to sensitize communities
about the CDSF. Regional preparation committees were chosen on each island to form the
Regional Executive Secretariats during the preparation period. Preparation work has
progressed quite well, due in large part to the Government's determination to strengthen its



27
policy of support to grassroots activities, and equally to the enthusiastic adherence of
communities to the project's objectives. The Presidential Act setting up CDSF was signed on
January 6, 1993, and the Presidential Decree defining its functions signed on April 13, 1993.
The National Executive Director, who was selected through broad consultation, was appointed
by the Chairman of the Preparation Committee. The Regional Executive Directors have also
been appointed.
5.3           More than 45 sub-projects estimated at US$1,200,000 equivalent have been
identified by communities and regional committees; ten totalling about US$200,000 are being
implemented and nine sub-projects related to the sectors of school rehabilitation and water
supply have been completed successfully with the community's contribution exceeding in some
cases 20% of the total cost of the sub-project (see Annex I for a list of sub-projects to be
implemented in the first year of the project).
B. Project Management
5.4           To facilitate execution of the two components of the project, separate
implementation structures will be used for each component. For the health component strong
support will be given to the Ministry of Health to improve its capacity to implement the health
program. Because of the cross-sectoral nature of the social fund, it will not be directly tied to
a particular ministry but will be independent and autonomously run.
Health Program
5.5           Within the Ministry of Health a small Project Office will be established under
the Directorate General to aid the MOH in the administration of the IDA credit. The Project
Office will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the component. In particular,
this unit will perform the following administrative tasks: (i) prepare annual work programs and
corresponding budgets; (ii) coordinate the activities of the various components; (iii) maintain
an accounting system for each project sub-component satisfactory to IDA and prepare quarterly
and annual financial reports; (iv) prepare all bidding documents in a manner acceptable to IDA;
(v) prepare quarterly and annual progress reports; (vi) ensure that audits are performed
annually in a timely fashion; (vii) manage all technical assistance contracts for the project; and
(viii) perform a mid-term review of the health component during the third year of project
implementation. The Project Office high level staff will include a project director, an
accountant, and a procurement specialist, with necessary support staff. Terms of reference for
the Project Office and its staff members are included in Annex III. Assurances were given
during negotiations that Project Office higher level staff at all times have qualifications and
experience acceptable to IDA (para. 7. l(d)). In addition, the person responsible for
procurement within the Project Office will attend a training course on Bank procurement
during the first year of project implementation.
5.6           Architectural design, preparation of bidding documents, bids, and supervision
of civil works financed through the project will be executed by a private firm or NGO
recruited with procedures acceptable to IDA. The Project Office will be responsible for
coordinating these activities as well as visiting the sites regularly. In the same way the
procurement of goods, technical assistance and training will be executed by private firms or
NGOs recruited with procedures acceptable to IDA. The Project Office's Director will be



28
responsible for coordination of all these activities according to the Work Plan. The
recruitment of private firms and/or NGOs for the first year, the procurement of goods, the
preparation of architectural design and bidding documents will be a condition of effectiveness
(para. 7.2(e)).
5.7           At the regional level, project implementation will be executed by the Regional
Health Teams with the assistance of the Project Office. The RHTs which are headed by the
RMO will be charged with supervising the implementation of health programs throughout the
region, organizing, with the assistance of the contracted private firm or NGO, on-the-job
training for district health workers, and stimulating and streamlining community participation.
RHTs will have the responsibility and authority for administrative and technical matters in
their region, including the supervision of activities in hospitals, health centers, rural
maternities, pharmacies, and health posts against established norms and monitorable
performance indicators.
5.8           For IEC activities, the project will strengthen management capacities of the
unit which will have the responsibility to plan, coordinate and supervise IEC activities. A
consultant will assist MOH in reorganizing its IEC activities, in defining the mandate of the
unit which will have the responsibility to coordinate and plan IEC health and population
activities, and in establishing the coordinating mechanisms between the IEC coordinating unit
and the various projects/programs, in preparing the job descriptions for the IEC central and
regional staff, and establishing procedures to ensure that resources are shared between
programs. This strengthening will take place before the credit becomes effective and will be
done in collaboration with other concerned donors, in particular with UNDP which is
preparing a development communication project.
Social Fund
5.9           Because of the nature of the social fund, its management has been given to an
organization, the Community Development Support Fund, which has administrative and
financial autonomy from the Government. The CDSF will enter into an agreement with the
Government regulating the channeling of the proceeds of the IDA credit. The signing of that
agreement will be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit (para. 7.2(a)). During
negotiations, the Government and CDSF gave assurances that this agreement and any
amendment thereto will be acceptable to IDA (para. 7. 1(e)). While the headquarters of the
CDSF is on the island of Grande Comore, because of geographical location, difficulty of
communications, and specific characteristics of each island, each of the three islands will have
a regional bureau. A bank account will be opened for each regional bureau and the deposit of
US$5,000 equivalent in each account will be a condition of effectiveness (para. 7.2(f)).
During negotiations, the Government and the CDSF gave assurances that the positions of
National Executive Director, Regional Executive Deputy Directors, and other higher level
personnel will be filled at all times with personnel whose qualifications and experience are
satisfactory to IDA (para. 7.1(f)).
5.10          Central Coordination Committee. The primary task of the CCC, which
meets twice a year, is to act as a Board of Directors setting the overall policies of the CDSF.
As such, its responsibilities are:



29
Define and orient the general policies of the CDSF;
Approve the annual budget and financial management procedures which are
submitted by the National Executive Director of the CDSF;
Analyze the audit reports on the management of the CDSF;
Examine and adopt appropriate procedures which will enable the CDSF to
support projects in the poorest areas;
Approve the global objectives of each Regional Committee's annual plan;

submitted by the National Executive Secretariat;
-      Adopt the Manual of Procedures (para. 3.36); and
-     Appoint the National Executive Director and the Regional Executive Deputy
Directors through open competition.
5.11         The CCC will be composed of 15 members who are to be named by decree - 7
representatives of the public administration (from the Ministries of Finance, Plan, Equipment,
Education, Health, and Production, and a representative from the Prime Minister's office), 8
representatives from the provinces (2 from each island) and 2 from national associations. The
president of the CCC will be nominated by his peers.
5.12         National Executive Secretariat. The NES is a permanent body composed of
the National Executive Director, an accountant, an administrative assistant, a procurement
specialist and a secretary. Their main tasks are the following:
-     Assure the financial and administrative management of the CDSF, including
preparing the budget of the CDSF;
-     Establish the financial accounts and prepare all other financial management
statements;
-     Assure the management of the IDA special account for the CDSF under the
responsibility of the National Executive Director;
-     Assure that all procurement follows the procurement rules stipulated in the
Manual of Procedures;
-     Study and propose to the CCC the elements of a national policy and a financing
strategy for community development;
-     Write and submit to CCC semi-annual evaluation reports on the activities of
the CDSF and propose necessary adjustments;



30
-      Define and create a data base of unit costs which are to be applicable during
sub-project evaluation; and
-      Approve sub-project requests which are FC5 million (about US$17,000) and
above, forwarding those above equivalent of FF350,000 (FC17.5 million or
about US$60,000) for non-objection from IDA;
5.13          Regional Committees. For each of the three islands, there will be a RC which
is composed of 8 members. The presidents are elected by their peers. The members include:
a representative of the Regional Finance Directorate, a representative of the Regional
Directorate of Plan (Community Development), and 6 other non-Government members chosen
on the basis of their qualifications and their knowledge of communities and their problems.
The primary responsibilities of the Regional Committees are the following:
-      Develop and propose to the NES a regional community development policy and
strategy;
-      Review and endorse or modify the annual programs developed by the Deputy
Regional Director;
-      Evaluate the impact of the CDSF on the development and welfare of the island
and propose modifications and adjustments;
-      Appoint a Regional sub-projects committee which will be responsible for
selecting sub-projects, approving grants of less than CF5 million (about
US$17,000) and submitting to the NES for decision all sub-projects above FC5
million; and
-      Collaborate with the RES to assure close liaison between local communities
and the CDSF to help define projects which respond to the needs of the poorest
groups.
5.14          Regional Executive Secretariats. The RES is headed by the Deputy Regional
Director who is the regional representative of the CDSF and has an accountantl/, a specialist
in communication, and a secretary as support. The RES is responsible for:
-      Animating the IEC campaign of promotion of the CDSF in the communities of
the island;
-      Preparing the annual action program for community development on the island;
-      Furnishing technical and financial support to communities in the preparation
and execution of projects;
-      Appraising sub-project requests according to the criteria and procedures in the
Manual of Procedures;
-      Assuring timely disbursements according to advancement of work; and
-      Submitting quarterly reports to the RC on the state of advancement of sub-
project implementation.
I/    This individual will also receive training in contracts and procurement to assure they fulfill this function at

5.15         Pilot Committees. The PCs are community groups which work with the RESs
of the CDSF to:
-     Identify sub-projects according to needs of the community;
-     Prepare with the RESs a proposed budget for the sub-project, including the
contributions of the community towards the sub-project realization;
-     Obtain firm commitment from the community or communities on their
participation in the execution and monitoring of work during project
implementation;
-     Sign the financial contract with the CDSF;
-     Mobilize local human, material, and financial resources necessary for execution
of the sub-project; and
-     Report periodically to the RES on the state of advancement of sub-project
implementation.
5.16         IDA review of sub-projects. The CDSF would have the authority to approve
sub-projects costing the equivalent of FF350,000 (about US$60,000) or less. Sub-projects that
have a total cost of more than FF350,000 equivalent would be submitted to IDA for prior
review. All sub-projects would, however, be subject to random ex-post review by IDA during
project supervision.
C. Implementation Schedule
5.17         Implementation Schedule. The project Implementation Schedule by category
is shown in Table 5.1 below. The project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1998,

D. Project Monitoring and Reporting
5.18          Health Component Monitoring. The Project Office will monitor and evaluate
project implementation according to the agreed performance indicators (Annex VI). The
Project Office will have an overall view of problems and issues in project implementation and
be in position to recommend any corrective actions that maybe required. It was agreed that a
project performance review, including management, will be carried out annually under terms
of reference acceptable to IDA and that the review findings and recommendations will be
discussed with IDA no later than October 31 of each year of project implementation. Because
community involvement is so important to the success of this component, this annual review
will also include an beneficiary assessment which looks into how beneficiaries feel health
services to be improving as well as further changes and modifications which could continue to
improve services. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that, no later than
July 31 of each year of project implementation, the Project Office will make available to IDA
the necessary documents and evidence for a review of (i) project implementation; and (ii) the
status of maintenance and operations of buildings rehabilitated with IDA credits (para. 7. 1(b)).
5.19          CDSF Sub-Project Monitoring. Strong monitoring of sub-project
implementation and impact will be conducted by the RES and reviewed by the NES. The
monitoring will be physical and financial, and will take into account the impact of the sub-
project on beneficiaries. The physical and financial monitoring will be included in the
Management and Information System (MIS). The signature of a contract with a consulting
firm to put in place the MIS will be a condition of effectiveness (para. 7.2(d)). During RES
supervision missions a detailed supervision report will be prepared indicating the physical
advancement of the project and flagging any implementation issues. The views of the
beneficiaries and the implementing agencies will also be recorded during these missions.
Every disbursement by the RES will be monitored through the MIS. A summary of the
findings of the supervision missions will be presented in the quarterly reports with
recommendations to improve the implementation and design of sub-projects.
5.20          During project implementation improvements would be made to strengthen the
MIS's capacity for the establishment and maintenance of "community profiles" - a set of social
indicators on communities where CDSF financed projects have been, or will be carried out.
Performances indicators would also be used to reflect the number and type of beneficiaries of
each type of project, such as the number of classrooms rehabilitated, beneficiaries of water
supply sub-projects, health care visits, vaccinations, trainees, in order to monitor real benefits
provided under CDSF sub-projects. Based on the results for the period of project preparation,
outcomes expected for the lifetime of the project could be quantified as final targets. The
number of beneficiaries are expected to be approximately: (i) 50,000 for the water supply
sector, involving 40 villages; (ii) 35,000 for the sewerage sector; (iii) 2,000 rural women; (iv)
15,000 students in primary schools; (v) 1,500 trainees in basic skills at the community level;
and (vi) 40,000 health care visits per year (additional to 75,000 existing at present). The
implementation of sub-projects will be monitored against a set of quantified performance
indicators which will be adjusted every year. The indicators are summarized in Annex VI.



34
5.21          To help monitor the quality and effectiveness of project implementation, each
RES will carry-out annual Beneficiary Assessments (BA) for a selected number of sub-projects
representative of the portfolio under implementation. Local consultants will be used for this
purpose. The information collected will focus in particular on the level of participation of the
beneficiaries in the sub-project, their view of the usefulness of the sub-project, the immediate
benefit of the sub-projects for the community, the relation with implementing agencies, the
sustainability of the activities undertaken, and any other issue relevant to the local population.
The findings of the BA will be presented in the annual report and will be discussed with the
CCC. Agreement was reached during negotiations on performance indicators for both
components of the project (para. 7. 1(g)).
5.22          Accounts. Separate accounts will be maintained for each component. Such
accounts will be maintained in accordance with internationally recognized accounting principles
and practices which are satisfactory to IDA.
5.23          Audits. The accounts, statements of expenditures and documentation relative
to procurement will be audited annually by an external auditor for each component acceptable
to IDA. Audits will be undertaken on a semi-annual basis for the CDSF. Audits will be
undertaken annually for the health component. Audit reports will be submitted to IDA three
months after the end of the period. The audits will include managerial, technical and financial
aspects of the project, will follow the International Standard for audits and accounting, and will
include a statement on the adequacy of the accounting system and internal controls, the
reliability of the statements of expenditures as a basis for loan disbursements, compliance with
financial covenants and for the CDSF compliance with the Manual of Procedures. The audit
reports will include a management letter. Agreement was reached during negotiations on the
content and timing of the audits (para. 7. l(h)). As a condition of effectiveness, the
Government will sign a contract or contracts with independent auditors, for each component,
satisfactory to IDA (para. 7.2(c)).
5.24          Mid-term Review. It was agreed during negotiations that a mid-term review
will take place not later than October 31st 1996 (para. 7.1(f)). In addition to the topics
covered in the annual and quarterly reviews, the mid-term review will examine in particular the
sustainability of the CDSF as an institution. If the institution is deemed sustainable, alternative
sources of funding will be sought to ensure its existence beyond the end of the project.
E. Implementation Issues in Comoros
5.25   Comoros has a poor implementation record mainly due to high turnover of personnel
working on the projects, slow disbursements, and lack of Government counterpart funds.
During the FY92 ARIS review process, three out of four projects were considered problem
projects. However, since then there has been considerable progress. A Country
Implementation Review (CIR) was undertaken in early 1993 which has focused the country's
attention on project implementation, and significant improvements have been seen in
disbursements for all ongoing projects, which were US$4.5 million in FY93 as opposed to
US$2.1 million in FY92.
5.26          The administrative reform coordinated by the CTARIAP will rationalize the
personnel budget for all the ministries; significant progress has been made and the process is



35
expected to be completed in early 1994. A reduction of at least 100 unqualified technical staff
of the MOH is a condition of disbursements for civil works for the rehabilitation of health
facilities (para. 7.3(a)).
5.27          Lessons drawn from the implementation experience in Comoros include: (i)
institutional and political commitment is key to project success, including continuity of project
staff; (ii) recurrent funding and Government financial planning have presented a problem; (iii)
projects should be as simple as possible and avoid excessive need for multi-agency
coordination; and (iv) maintenance of physical investments is poor and linked to poor
motivation of public servants.
5.28          This project will address these shortcomings in several ways: (i) the relevant
institutions have been thoroughly involved in the project preparation (Ministry of Health and
staff of the CDSF); (ii) essential legal texts for both components have been enacted before
Board presentation; (iii) project design and administrative arrangements have been kept as
simple as possible, with two components; and (iv) maintenance of physical investment is more
likely due to community participation in financing of investments and management of their
operation.
5.29          In addition, for the health sector: (i) technical details for the civil works for the
health component have been completed before negotiations; (ii) the project works within the
framework of the structural adjustment program, and in particular is based on a reform of the
entire public health system; and (iii) the project leverages additional resources through cost-
recovery and community responsibilization. The Government is reforming the budget process
and has assured that financing of the health sector will be at a level commensurate with its
efficient functioning (see para 3.17). For the CDSF: (i) successful pilot operations have been
undertaken during project preparation under the PPF; and (ii) the CDSF has been created with
staff independent from the public administration.
5.30          In order to ensure that the project objectives and the World Bank's procedures
are well understood within the implementing institutions, there will be a project launch
workshop at which administrative arrangements will be reviewed. A mid-term review will take
place after somewhat more than 2 years (presently scheduled for October 1996), which will
allow the Government of Comoros and IDA to review progress and make changes as
necessary. Particular focus of this review will be on the budget executed in the health sector,
the maintenance of investments made under the CDSF, the future of the CDSF and the level of
community contribution in CDSF activities (para. 5.25).

Figures in parenthesis represent IDA financing.
5.32         Civil works. For the health component civil works contracts will be awarded
following competitive bidding procedures acceptable to IDA in accordance with IDA guidelines
for procurement. Refurbishment of existing buildings will be awarded following Local
Competitive Bidding (LCB), up to an aggregate amount of US$1.9 million. Tenders will be
advertised locally, bidders will be given minimum 45 days for submission of bids. Evaluation
criteria will be specified. All bids will be opened in the presence of bidder's representatives.
Eligible foreign contractors will be allowed to participate in the bidding, and standard bidding
documents will be reviewed and approved by IDA prior to advertising. For the
implementation of this sub-component, a selected private firm/NGO will be contracted to help
the Project Office prepare bidding documents, launch bids, select contractors, prepare contracts
and supervise works.
5.33          Goods. Goods financed under the project will include vehicles, furniture,
medical equipment, and other equipment and materials. Except as provided below, goods will
be procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with IDA's
Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (May 1992). Contracts for



37
goods procured through ICB would amount to about US$1.4 million. Other goods, which
cannot be grouped into bids packages of at least US$25,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate
amount of US$1.4 million, would be procured through prudent shopping on the basis of price
quotations from at least three suppliers. This consists of supplies and operating costs of the
project office of the MOH and for the CDSF (US$0.2 million and US$0.6 million) as well as
other goods to be procured under the health component, mainly supplies (US$0.15 million),
vehicles (US$0.10 million) and communication and computer equipment (US$0.35 million).
5.34         Technical Assistance. For the technical assistance (US$420,000) and training
(US$1.15 million), consultants will be selected in accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use
of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executive Agency." The
work program and financing have been described in such a manner as to encourage the use of
consultants from Comoros, and, where expertise does not exist in the country, consultants
from the region. Details on consultancies are given in Annex III.
5.35         CDSF. For the CDSF, civil works will be carried out by local communities
according to the Manual of Procedures agreed by IDA. For sub-projects financed under the
CDSF (US$5.4 million), the executing agency responsible for sub-project implementation will
be responsible for procurement and will follow IDA's guidelines for procurement (paras 3.34
and 3.35). Because most of the executing agencies and local communities lack experience in
procurement, the CDSF will assist them for the preparation of bidding documents, bid
evaluation, contract award, and contract management. Prior to signing the sub-project
contract, the CDSF will assure that procurement procedures to be followed are in compliance
with agreed guidelines detailed in the Manual of Procedures. Contracts for goods and civil
works for sub-projects will be awarded as follows: (a) contracts ranging in size from
US$20,000 to US$100,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$4.0 million, will be awarded on
the basis of LCB; (b) for contracts valued at less than US$20,000 equivalent, up to an
aggregate amount of US$1.5 million, local bidding would take place through notices posted in
the villages and in the offices of the CDSF as well as by radio. Results of such bidding would
be published officially; and (c) for contracts valued at less than US$20,000 equivalent, up to an
aggregate amount of US$0.5 million, the beneficiary agencies will carry out local shopping and
would provide CDSF with all relevant documentation for review, indicating its choice among
the offers presented. Aggregate amounts for procurement methods for sub-projects add up to
more than the total amount of the IDA credit allocated to sub-project execution ($5.4 million),
in order to allow the CDSF the flexibility to make greater use of LCB wherever possible.
Supplies provided under CDSF's financing will be delivered to the executing agencies as the
need for them arises according to the sub-project implementation schedule and under the
supervision of the NGO CECI (refer to CECI's terms of reference in Annex III chapter II).
5.36         Bank Review Requirements. Prior review by IDA would be required for all
consultancy contracts for individuals or for contracts of over US$10,000 equivalent. Working
drawings, draft tender documents, master lists of furniture, equipment, supplies and vehicles
will be reviewed by IDA. For the health component, IDA review of tender documents prior to
award will be required for contracts above US$50,000 equivalent for civil works, and
US$25,000 for goods. For the CDSF, any sub-project of a total investment of FF350,000
equivalent (about US$60,000) or more will be subject to prior review by IDA. All other
contracts will be subject to selective post award review by IDA. The use of IDA's standard
bidding documents for goods and works and IDA's letter of invitation for consultants will be



38
made mandatory by the Project Office and contracted private firms/NGOs. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that the Manual of Procedures of the CDSF, including its annexes
on procurement and standard bidding documents, will be at all times acceptable to IDA. IDA
will organize a project launch workshop when the Credit is effective and will prepare an
implementation manual including IDA's standard bidding documents for goods and works and
IDA's standard letter of invitation for consultants, for the use of the Project Office and
contracted private firms/NGOs. Agreement on the use of IDA's standard bidding documents
was obtained during negotiations (para. 7.1(j)).

Note:  Health component: Government contribution of staff and supplies for which IDA does
not disburse are not shown. CDSF component: contribution of the beneficiaries in
kind and in manpower are not shown.
5.38          All disbursements will be fully documented except for: (i) payments under
contracts and subprojects of less than US$10,000; (ii) training; and (iii) incremental operating
costs which will be submitted under statements of expenditure (SOE). The Project Office
within the MOH and the CDSF will be responsible for monitoring disbursements. The SOEs
and all records such as contracts, orders, invoices, and payroll vouchers will be retained by
these units for inspection by supervision missions and reviewed by the annual audit. The
Project Office director and the CDSF Executive Director will be the primary liaison persons
between IDA and the borrower for all disbursement issues pertaining to the project. The
closing date of the credit will be June 30, 1999.

5.39   Special Account. To ensure that funds for this project are readily available and to
facilitate disbursement MOH and CDSF will each open a Special Account in French Francs in
a commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. Initial deposits each of
US$200,000 will be advanced to those accounts from the IDA credit. The funds in these
special accounts will be managed by the Project Office and the CDSF and all documentation
pertinent to these accounts will be maintained in a manner acceptable to IDA for inspection
during regular supervision missions. The Project Office director and the CDSF Executive
Director will be responsible for their respective disbursements during project implementation,
will provide monthly statements to IDA and will be responsible for submitting applications for
the replenishment of these accounts. All payments of less than US$10,000 will be made
through the Special Accounts. Payment requests above this threshold may be submitted under
the direct payment, reimbursement or Special Commitment procedure. The Special Accounts
will be replenished monthly, or when one-third of the Special Account has been disbursed,
whichever is sooner.
5.40         The standard disbursement profile for health projects in sub-Saharan Africa is
nine and a half years. However, there is a pipeline of sub-projects that have been developed
which will be appraised by credit effectiveness. In addition, standard bidding documents and
procedures will be developed by effectiveness for the health component. Therefore,
disbursements will pick up rapidly after the first year of project implementation. The
estimated schedule of disbursements is at Annex V.
VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS
6.1          Benefits. The project is expected to enhance the development of human
resources by improving the health, education, and income status of the population. Through
the health and population component, available primary health care is expected to improve with
the strengthening of peripheral services and closer involvement of communities in their
provision; information, education, and communication and better family planning services
should increase the contraceptive prevalence rate, reducing fertility, as well as raising
awareness of the need for AIDS prevention. The CDSF would complement activities in the
health component by building upon strong community involvement and aiding communities and
individuals to more effectively and efficiently channel community resources and implement
local development efforts, including much needed rehabilitation of primary schools, water
supply and health posts. It would provide an opportunity to strengthen the capacity of local
associations and NGOs, as well as encourage the creation of new NGOs, in addition to
enhancing the well-being and economic role of women in society.
6.2          Risks. The main risks to the implementation of the project are weak
Government capacity and potential delays due to political uncertainties. To address the first,
the goal of the health and population component is to strengthen community involvement, both
financially and managerially, in the provision of basic health services as well as to build
Government capacity and improve the efficiency of these services. More specifically,
personnel would be trained, a unit within the Ministry of Health would be created under the
Directorate General of Health Services for procurement and administration of implementation,



40
and technical assistance would be provided in key areas for capacity building. To insulate the
CDSF from weak Government capacity and political interference, an autonomous agency
staffed by selected, contractual employees would manage the fund. In addition, community
training, strong CDSF supervision, a transparent management information system, and semi-
annual auditing of accounts would enhance the overall efficiency of the community
development component of the project.
VII. CONDITIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.1          During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government as follows:
(a)    agreement on the Manual of Procedures of the CDSF, which is to rule
selection and execution of all sub-projects; and that any change will be
submitted to IDA for approval (para. 3.25);
(b)   in collaboration with the Government, IDA will, not later than October 3 1st,
1994 and, thereafter, not later than October 31 of each subsequent year,
undertake a joint annual review of the project during which they will exchange
views generally on all matters relating to the progress of the project, and in
particular financial and procurement performance of the CDSF and MOH
(containing the findings of the independent audit), CDSF sub-project
performance, and progress made by the MOH in light of the agreed
performance indicators. Three months prior to the annual review, a report will
be submitted to IDA reviewing the situation and describing problems
encountered and solutions to be applied. These reports will contain a draft
budget and work program, and will review maintenance and operation of
physical investments. Quarterly reports will also be submitted. (para. 5.18);
(c)   the budget for MOH will maintain the 1992 real level of expenditure with at
least 20% in non-salary expenditures, and the budget for the current and
subsequent fiscal years will be reviewed annually with IDA (para. 3.17);
(d)   the CDSF and the Project Office are to be staffed at all times with competent
higher-level personnel with terms of reference, experience, and qualifications
acceptable to IDA (para. 5.5 and 5.9);
(e)   the agreement between the Government and the CDSF for the channeling of the
proceeds of the IDA credit and any amendment thereto will be acceptable to
IDA (para. 5.9);
(f)    not later than October 31, 1996, a joint mid-term review will take place. In
addition to the topics covered in the annual and quarterly reviews, the mid-
term review will examine in particular the sustainability of the CDSF as an
institution. (para. 5.24);



41
(g)    agreement on performance indicators for each component which can be found
at Annex VI. (para. 5.21);
(h)   for the CDSF component, audits twice a year. The health component will have
annual audits. Independent audit reports will be submitted to IDA (para. 5.23);
(i)   that MOH will issue a public expenditure program for the health sector for
1995-97 by December 31, 1994, which will be reviewed annually with IDA.
(para. 3.22);
(j)    agreement on standard bidding documents for civil works, purchase of goods,
and the recruitment of consultants (para. 5.36);
(k)   the contribution of communities in CDSF sub-projects and involvement in local
health initiatives is a minimum of 20% except for the poorest communities
(para. 4.2); and
(l)   that no sub-project would exceed the equivalent of FF450,000 (about
US$80,000), and that prior review by IDA will be required for all sub-projects
exceeding FF350,000 equivalent (about US$60,000) (para. 5.16).
7.2           Credit Effectiveness will be conditional on the following measures:
(a)   the Financing Agreement between the Government and CDSF has been duly
executed; (para. 5.9);
(b)   the Manual of Procedures has been adopted by CDSF (para. 3.3);
(c)   the Government will sign a contract or contracts with independent auditors, for
each component, satisfactory to IDA (para. 5.23);
(d)    a contract, acceptable to IDA, for the installation of a management information
system for CDSF has been signed (para. 5.19);
(e)   the Government has recruited the private firms or non-governmental
organizations for the procurement of goods, for the preparation of architectural
designs and bidding documents, for the supervision of civil works, and for the
preparation and supervision of training programs, during the 12 months period
immediately following effectiveness (para. 5.6); and
(f)   the Government has opened, on behalf of the CDSF, a bank account in local
currency, to be operated and maintained by CDSF, in each of the three sub-
regions, and has made an initial deposit of US$5,000 equivalent into each such
account (para. 5.9).



42
7.3    As a condition of disbursement of the civil works for rehabilitation of MOH facilities:
(a)    the unqualified technical health personnel of the MOH, as determined as of
June 1, 1993, has been reduced in number by not less than 100 agents; (para.
5.26); and
(b)    the facilities to be rehabilitated have been (i) vested with financial and
managerial autonomy in accordance with the administrative reform program
detailed in the letter of health policy; and (ii) reorganized and the staff
redeployed, as needed, to meet the requirements of the revised organizational
structure prepared in 1993 (para. 5.1).
Recommendation
7.4           Subject to the above assurances and conditions, this project constitutes a
suitable basis for an IDA credit of SDR 9.2 million (US$13.0 million equivalent) to the
Federal Islamic Republic of Comoros on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity.

INFORMATION. EDUCATION AND COMMUNICATION
Background
1.           The Government of the Comoros has recognized the need to use Information,
Education and Communication (IEC) to motivate its population to adopt health practices which are
more conducive to good health. For this reason, it has included in all its major public health
program an IEC component. However, this program approach has, as in many countries, lead to
a fragmentation of IEC activities. Because each project or program has an IEC component, the
resources allocated to IEC activities are not allocated on the basis of national health priorities but
on a program basis, and in some cases, on a project basis, which lead to coordination problems
within programs. The resources allocated to IEC are often limited and linked to the importance
the project designer had given to IEC rather than to real needs. Consequently, some programs
have more IEC resources than others and some do not have any. Presently, the IEC Population
Program and the National AIDS Control Program (NACP), discussed below, have more human
and financial resources than the other public health programs.
2.           Population IEC activities have been carried out in the Comoros by the First IEC
Population Project since the launching of the national family planning program in 1986. This
project as well as that which is presently on-going was financed by UNFPA and executed by
FAO. The objectives of the Second Population IEC project are to increase awareness of family
planning and to eliminate the obstacles to the use of contraceptives. This project, which spent an
average of US$185,000 a year on family planning IEC, concentrated its activities in three main
areas:
a.    Training of health personnel and of community workers in family planning
interpersonal communication and counselling. However, these training activities
have been limited to project areas (about ten villages) and only 160 health
personnel and about 60 community workers were trained;
b.    Research studies the objectives of which were to identify psycho-socio-cultural
obstacles to family planning and minimize the risk that formal and informal
opinion leaders speak out against the use of contraception. These research
activities were to provide a data base on social organization, cultural models and
ideal family size which could be used to develop an IEC strategy and appropriate
messages for different target groups. However, the studies although useful must
be interpreted with caution because the samples were very small and the
methodology was not always as rigorous as it should have been; and
c.    IEC material production which was carried out in the audio-visual center of the
project. Here too, because of limited resources, some short cuts were taken and
materials were not always pre-tested before they were produced, but only
evaluated after they had been produced and distributed. This practice has led to
the production of materials which were not understood by the target groups.
3.           The purpose of these activities was to inform opinion leaders and target population
about family planning. To this end, the IEC Population project organized seminars, conferences
and study tours for officials. For example, in December 1987, a colloquium brought together in

Moroni many religious leaders including the Grand Mufti to discuss the acceptability of family
planning in an Islamic context. The Grand Mufti then went to Morocco in March 1988 to
observe how a muslim country dealt with family planning. In addition, several seminars were
organized for village religious leaders. These activities succeeded in making family planning
more acceptable in the Comoros. The Grand Mufti and some other religious leaders endorsed
openly the use of contraception for health and socio-economic reasons in 1988. However, neither
leaders or the public seem to understand that population growth is a problem and that slowing the
rate of this growth is necessary for the country.
4.           The second Population IEC project will end in April 1993 and is to be renewed at
the request of the Government, however, according to the UNFPA, the level of financial support
is to be reduced (only US$110,000 is budgeted for 1993). Consequently, the existing need for
additional support will become even greater.
5.           The Government of the comoros launched its National AIDS Control Program
(NACP) in June 1990 with a resource mobilization conference. Its first Medium-Term Plan was
prepared at that time. Since then, the NACP has been supported by several donors. In 1992, the
program received about US$246,300 from four donors: WHO/GPA provided about US$160,000,
the European Economic Community (EEC) US$36,000, the Republic of South Africa US$12,500
and the UNDP US$37,500. About half of these funds were used for IEC activities while the
other half was used for laboratory activities and epidemiological surveillance. For 1993, WHO
committed US$160,000 which will be added to the US$40,000 left over from 1992-93 EEC
contribution and US$37,000 provided by the UNDP. WHO has indicated that they intend to
maintain the present level of support until 1995, but no other financial aid is assured. Therefore,
if the NACP is to continue its IEC activities as well as to detect STDs and to develop the capacity
to do blood screening to prevent the spread of HIV, it will need additional resources. AIDS IEC
activities have included the production of one poster, several awareness and information seminars
for opinion leaders and youth, radio shows, radio spots and songs. Although the program spend
about half of its resources on IEC activities, it does not have enough resources to do the research
necessary to develop messages and produce IEC materials appropriate for the various target
groups. In addition, the program personnel need to be trained in these areas.
6.           The other public health programs have even fewer resources than the family
planning and the NACP. The Extended Program of Inoculation (EPI), financed by UNICEF and
WHO, has limited financial and human resources (it does not have an IEC specialist on staft) but
it disseminate messages during soccer matches and in theater plays. It cannot however, use the
radio for lack of resources. The National Malaria Control Program, also financed by UNICEF
and WHO, has very few resources for IEC. The other public health programs--nutrition, water
and sanitation and mother and child health--have no or very few IEC activities.
7.           IEC activities at the level of the ministry are to be coordinated by the National
Health Education Service (NHES) that was created in May 1991. For the period 1992-93, WHO
has programmed US$34,000 to support this service, some local training and the production of
IEC materials. However, this service is very weak: It is in fact constituted by only one person
who is involved in EPI and malaria IEC activities but who spend most of its time on AIDS IEC
activities and who has moved to the NACP office. The Population IEC project carry out its
activities independently not only of the NHES but also of the MCH/FP program.

8.           In conclusion, some IEC activities are carried out in the Comoros, but they are
concentrated in two programs. In addition, because each program/project has its own IEC
component and there is no coordination between programs/projects, IEC resources are
fragmented, no program has the capacity to produce quality IEC and some program cannot have
any IEC activities. Projects generally do not have resources to conduct studies that are necessary
to better understand target groups, to know what are the best communication channels for each
group and thereby develop more appropriate and better targeted messages. To remedy this
situation, the Health component of the IDA project proposes, on the one hand, to reinforce the
planning and coordination capacities of the NHES, and, on the other, to provide resources to
support IEC activities for priority public health programs.
Proposed Project Activities
9.            The objectives of the Health component of the project are to: (i) increase the
efficiency of the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MOH) at the central and regional
levels (institutional reinforcement) so that it can provide better quality services to the Comorian
population; and (ii) to support priority programs such as the family planning and the NACP.
Because IEC has an important role to play to increase contraceptive prevalence rates and prevent
the spread of HIV contamination, the project proposes to: (i) assist the MOH to reinforce its IEC
capacities both at the national and the regional levels; and (ii) support the IEC components of the
family planning program and the NACP. These IEC activities, although program specific, will
need to be carried out in the context of the national IEC strategy for health and population which
will be developed by the Directorate for Health Education which will be created to replace the
NHES in collaboration with the various public health and population programs.
A. Institutional Strengtheing
10.          Rationale. Program/project managers who need to use IEC to reach their
objectives and international donors who support these programs/projects recognize that, in order
to improve quality and cost-efficiency of IEC activities, it is necessary to reinforce the NHES and
to replace it by a National Health Education Directorate (NHED), as was suggested in the
preparation document written by the Government and the Association Sante-Internationale. This
institutional strengthening will assist the MOH to carry out its IEC activities for all its programs,
but in particular for its priority programs. The mandate of this directorate should be to: (i) plan
and coordinate IEC activities of the different health and population programs; (ii) control the
quality of the IEC materials produced by the programs/projects; (iii) provide technical assistance
to IEC staff at the central and the regional levels; (iv) identify studies which need to be carried
out to develop appropriate messages, prepare terms of reference for these studies and supervise
them; and (v) produce or supervise the production of IEC audio-visual and printed materials. In
the case of the last two activities, the NHED would be encouraged to sub-contract to outside
experts from both the public and the private sectors.
11.          Activities. This will be done by strengthening: (i) IEC and management
capacities of the existing IEC staff of the various programs/projects, both at the central and the
regional level; and (ii) production capacities for audio-visual and print materials of the IEC
Population project so that this production unit can produce higher quality materials, not only for
the IEC Population project but for all the ministry programs (the project does not intend to give
the center the capacities to produce more materials nor to provide the center with capacities to
produce other than audio and video tapes and to do simple printing as it does at present. It is



50
ANNEX II
Page 4 of 5
expected that much of the material production will be sub-contracted). International technical
assistance will be necessary to assist the MOH to: (i) organize its new directorate and to define
its mandate and that of the provincial team; (ii) identify the coordination mechanisms between the
various programs/projects and the NEHD and to specify how the resources will be shared; and
(iii) establish supervision mechanisms for the various levels. This technical assistance will also
assist the MOH to prepare job descriptions for all the personnel who will be carrying out IEC
activities at the central, regional and community levels.
12.           In order to strengthen the capacities of the central level IEC personnel, the project
will finance one long-term training for the NHED Director and a two-month IEC training in
Africa for three IEC staff. For the regional personnel, the project will finance one-month foreign
training for three regional IEC officers. In addition, a session for the training of trainers in
interpersonal communication and community mobilization will be organized in Moroni. This
training will be carried out with the assistance of an international consultant who will assist the
NHED personnel in adapting a curriculum developed and pre-tested in Zaire and in carrying out
the workshop.
13.           The equipment to be provided by the project will increase the capacities of the
central material production unit to produce higher quality materials, it will not increase it ability
to produce more materials nor will it provide new capacities such as the capacity to do
photography or serigraphy. In addition, the four mobile videos will make it possible for the IEC
personnel at the central level and in the three regions to make audio-visual presentations at
seminars or in villages.
B. Support to IEC Activities for Priority Programs
14.           Rationale.  Resources available for IEC activities are too limited even for priority
programs. The strengthening of the NHED and of the regional teams will contribute to a higher
quality and a better cost efficiency, but additional support will be necessary to ensure that these
programs can reach their objectives.
15.           Activities. The objectives of the IEC activities for the family planning and the
AIDS control programs are the following: (i) motivate target populations to use contraceptives or,
in the case of the AIDS program, to adopt low risk behaviors; (ii) develop messages based on an
in-depth knowledge of the target audience; and (iii) disseminate messages using a multimedia
strategyl/ tailored to the media habits of the target audience. In order to reach these objectives,
the project propose to finance the following activities:
a.     Two study tours: One for family planning and the other for AIDS. The family
planning tour could be to one of the Muslim countries that has been successful in
setting up training, monitoring, supervision and evaluation mechanisms in an
integrated context (FP and MCH) such as Tunisia. It is also a country where a
mobile strategy has been tested and from which the Comorian could learn. The
AIDS study tour should be to a country which has one of the most successful
AIDS prevention IEC Program in Africa;
1/     The media that can be uaed are radio (national and local), theater, video, traditional media and interpersonal
communication.



51
ANNEX II
Page 5 of 5
b.     Several studies: (i) a knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) study on AIDS and
sexuality; (ii) a target audience survey to determined what are the privileged
means of communication for the various target audiences, their media habits, etc.;
(iii) a study on obstacles to family planning and causes of discontinued
contraceptive use; and (iv) some qualitative studies as needed (for example, focus
group discussions, in depth interview, points of service intercept studies);
c.     Training: (i) ten workshops to train "relays", i.e. persons who will assist in
disseminating messages, such as leaders of community associations. These
"relays" will be trained in interpersonal communication and community
mobilization, with particular reference to FP and AIDS; and (ii) four seminars for
radio and print journalists;
d.     IEC Materials: Design, pre-test and production (by NHED or by a sub-contractor
under the supervision of NHED and of the concerned program) of IEC materials
which could include audio-visual materials (video or audio tapes), theater plays,
songs, sketches, flip charts, in agreement with identified needs; and
e.     Technical assistance: Two months of technical assistance to assist with specific
tasks which will be identified as the project progresses. It could be to assist with
the design and the execution of studies or to design printed material such as a flip
chart.

Results ExDected
101.         Financial and administrative management. A structured and organized Executive
Secretariat would be functional, endowed with appropriate means and procedures of work, and
staffed with qualified professionals. More precisely, a reliable and proven system of supply and
financial management would have been established within six months of the intervention by CECI
(target date: December 1993). The financial management cell would be endowed with capable
local personnel. Organizationally, the Manual of Procedures would be put in place; the functional
relations between the different posts and levels of decision would have been established; the
information system would be in position and working: financial and technical documents would
be produced according to the calendar forecast and would be of sufficient quality according to an
external audit (monthly accounts, financial reports, logbooks, annual reports).
102.         Technical Assistance. At least 50% of the villages of Comoros would have
benefitted from the technical and financial support of the CDSF for the realization of their
program of community development; the same number of pilot committees would be installed and
trained by the CDSF; the rate of activity would be 20 sub-projects per year in Grande Comore
and Anjouan, and 10 in Moheli; at least 50% of villages which have completed a project with
financing from the CDSF will be maintaining their investments using a budget for upkeep and
maintenance.

B. Training Activities 1991-95
103.         Introduction. As the CDSF component is aimed at promoting self-reliant,
sustainable, socio-economic development of rural communities, by increasing the local
institutional capacity for development planning and implementation, training would play a crucial
role to help communities attain the proposed targets.
104.         Objective. The general objective of the training plan is: (a) to help implement a
new concept of community development based on an effective use of available resources through
a better organization and management, and a larger concern for maintenance of existing public
property; (b) train managers for communities in basic techniques of management, project and
budget preparation, and communication. The training plan has also its own specific objectives,
which are: (i) at the intermediate and lower level to train manpower that is needed to implement
sub-projects in various sectors (school rehabilitation, water supply system, post health
construction, etc.); (ii) to provide support to small contractors who have contracts with
communities through the CDSF's financing; (iii) to help promote women's development by
providing training in primary health care, nutrition, child care and by improving literacy rates.
105.         Training Plan. The training plan would involve: (a) 1800 members of the
Community Pilot Committees from about 180 villages (Grande Comore: 800 agents, Anjouan:
800 agents, Moheli: 200 agents); (b) 100 book-keepers -one for each community-; (c) 100
warehouse-keepers; (d) 600 masons, 180 carpenters, 360 school furniture makers, 100 fitters and
plumbers, and 270 painters; (c) 90 job site supervisors; (d) 2500 rural women in the three islands.
106.         Organization of Training. Training activities will be coordinated by the
Information and Training Unit (ITU). In view of the special nature of the CDSF, both activities
must be coordinated very closely if they are to be successful:
a.    Information. In the area of information, ITU's main responsibilities are: (i) to
coordinate main activities of the information campaign on the the CDSF; (ii) to identify
main issues in implementing the CDSF's program, in particular introducing a new concept
of organization and management at the community level, and the community adopting a
maintenance budget as a conditionality for the financing of any micro-project by the
CDSF; (iii) to organize seminars and colloquys on community development, by special
attention to the social behavior of communities; and (iv) to propose a strategy of
information for the CDSF, and an appropriate action plan.
b.    Training. ITU's responsibilities are: (i) to propose a training strategy, in
accordance with the needs of each community and in response to the main issues
identified, (ii) to draw up the training programs with the participation of professional staff
and consultants both national and expatriate, (iii) to propose suitable measures to associate
supervisory staff closely with training activities; (iv) to provide for monitoring and control
of training; and (v) to evaluate training actions and propose adequate actions to improve
the quality of training provided.
107.         Strategy of Training. The function of training should be understood by all as
crucial to the CDSF's success. Staff and technical assistance would actively participate in training.
To this end, terms of reference for their assignment would include specific clauses on training,



68
ANNEX III
Page 17 of 18
and their participation will be clearly defined in close coordination with ITU to ensure a
coherence in methodology and evaluation of training; the performance of consultants will be
finally evaluated to a large extent on their ability and efforts in providing training to local staff; in
addition, seminars in communication and training methods for technicians skilled in production
will be organized with a view to strengthening the training corps and ensuring effective
monitoring of trainees in their place of work.
108.         Several modes of training will be used to help implement the training plan:
a.    training in management for managers at both central and local level will provided
by CECI's consultants, whose experience and skills have proved to be satisfactory during
the project preparation. Trainees would be selected through the formation of the Pilot
Village Committees among the best educated habitants and/or those recognized for their
strong leadership. Training would consist of 2 to 3 one-week seminars organized yearly
for groups of about 12 trainees. The majority of training would, however, be delivered
on-the-job during the period of project identification, preparation and implementation.
Topics of discussion would include: (a) the CDSF's objectives, organization, and
financing procedures; (b) project preparation, proposals, and implementation, (c)
community development and organization, (d) budget preparation and monitoring, (e)
work planning and organization, (f) communication and reporting, and (g) specific issues
either political and social or economic relevant to the new concept of community
development and organization;
b.    training for women's development would be carried out by CARITAS's
professional staff whose performance is well-known in this area; training would be
conducted for one half-day a week for 10 months, including reading, arithmetic, home
economics, family book-keeping, child care, basic health care, nutrition and tailoring;
each trainee would have to pay an annual tuition fee of 1,200 FC. The impact of this
program is likely to be important but not sufficient in relation to national needs. During
the project implementation support would be provided by the CDSF to build up the
training capacity of local NGOs, particularly Women Associations, in improving the
literacy rate and delivering training at the most remote and poorest villages.
c.    training for workers in basic skills will be provided on-the-job by mobile teams
composed of job site supervisors, foremen and part-time trainers hired under the project.
Trainees for each job site would be selected and divided into professional and qualification
groups. Training programs would start with a two-day orientation session including
presentation of the main features of work, organization of the job site, preparation of
materials, testing of equipment and inventory of individual tools, discussion of individual
assignment. Most training would be delivered on the job. Each group of trainees would be
placed under the responsibility of a foreman whose professional qualification and
communication ability are confirmed after test. Foremen are responsible for ensuring the
quality control, providing technical advice, and organizing theoretical training as
necessary.

Indicators of Performance of the FADC
The performance of the FADC will be evaluated every three months, in particular at the end of
each fiscal year, based on the indicators of performance established in the light of the results
obtained during the preparation of the project. These indicators translate, depending on the sector
of intervention, into numbers of classrooms rehabilitated or constructed (education); the number
of beneficiaries of water supply and rural roads projects (social infrastructure); the number of
medical visits at the level of remote villages (primary health care); the number of women
benefitting from literacy programs and other training for the promotion of women (women in
development). Furthermore, indicators were also agreed for the evaluation of the FADC in other
ways, such as (i) the effect of capacity building efforts at the village level, in particular in terms
of the number of village steering committees trained in administrative and financial project
management; (ii) the improvement of the techniques of local labor, through the introduction of
improved techniques in the sub-projects of the FADC.
Results expected at the end of each year are the following: (a) education: 3,000 students
benefiting from 35 to 40 rehabilitated classrooms; (b) water supply: 10,000 beneficiaries; (c)
health care: 40,000 health care visits; (d) women in development: 4,000 women trained in
literacy, childcare, nutrition, and artisanry; (e) roads and bridges: 2,000 people; (f) management
strengthening: 40 steering committees trained in project management; (g) human resources: 800
people trained in different professions.
The management capacity of the FADC will also be evaluated, based on the following annual
indicators: (a) ability to assist the preparation and implementation of sub-projects: 50 sub-
projects approved and 40 sub-projects completed; (b) popularisation campaigns: training of 30
steering comrnittees; (c) sustainability of the interventions of the FADC: 20 steering committees
still in operation after the completion of sub-projects, as measured by the creation of a
maintainance fund, and by the constitution of units responsible for the maintainance of the works
completed; (d) participation of other donors in sub-projects; (e) training of local NGOs working
in the fields of literacy and women in development (3 NGOs per year).

Due to the implementation record in Comoros and the fact that there is no resident mission in
Comoros which can maintain contact with the project, supervision missions are
correspondingly heavy.

THE PILOT EXPERIENCE AT MITSOUDJE HEALTH CENTER
1.    The project consists of the construction and equipment of a health center, the installation
of a system of management to ensure the operating costs of the center, and the elaboration of a
model of health services that could be reproduced in other areas. Money was raised in the
community for the construction of the facility, and UNDP has provided major assistance. The
French NGO ASI has been engaged for technical assistance. The project is to run three years of
which 2 are completed. A review was conducted in January 1993, the report of which is in the
project files.
2.    The center, located on the island of Grand Comore in the relatively wealthy village of
Mitsoudje, includes services of external consultation, MCH/FP, EPI, laboratory, dentistry as well
as hospitalization for observation. As the center is about 40 minutes away from Moroni by car,
serious cases are evacuated to the hospital there, as are radiology requests.
3.    All services are paying, except for vaccinations. Surveys were conducted in the local area
to determine what the rates should be. For instance, the rate of FC200 to see a nurse (triage) was
fixed to equal the cost of the taxi fare to Moroni where treatment would be free at a regular
clinic. The tariff is shown below:
Consultation

physician (direct)  1,000

ANNEX IX
Page 2 of 4
There is no formal system of fees for the indigent. This will depend on the discretion of the
staff, and rebates are rare. All receipts are retained at the facility level.
4.     Drugs are supplied through a village pharmacy installed within the center. Patients must
pay for their drugs, as with all other pharmacies in Comoros. Review of the system shows that
patients spend on average FC 900 per prescription and that virtually no patients were unable to
fulfill this prescription (either through lack of money or due to lack of stock in the pharmacy).
However, a problem noted in the report is that the margin allowed by the PNAC (20%) does not
cover all the center's costs in running the pharmacy, and discussions are under way regarding the
possibility of increasing this margin.
5.     When setting up the center, the project also conducted surveys in the area on what the
population expected from their health center. One important complaint about public health
services is that the patients are treated impolitely. Therefore at Mitsoudje, care was taken to train
all the staff in patient relations. Reception staff in particular are evaluated on their courtesy.
When the center was first in operation, a "greeter" was posted at the reception to explain to
newcomers the philosophy of service and cost recovery.
6.     Management of the center is shared by a committee of local residents, and by the doctor.
Other than requiring conformity with standards for a health center, the Ministry of Health has
very little involvement in the operation of the facility.
7.     Staff in the center consist of 18 civil servants and 3 unskilled staff hired contractually by
the center. The doctor is on detachment from the government service, and is paid by the project
at a rate about twice that of doctors in the Ministry of Health. In addition to their regular
salaries, staff receive a "prime" based on their individual performance and on the receipts on the
center. This prime averaged about 25% of their salaries in January 1993. The center also has
the right to return to the public service any employees who do not meet the standards of their
work. This has already occurred twice.
8.     The results: The center became operational in April 1992. Consequently, definite
conclusions are premature. However, important initial reactions were reflected in the evaluation
report and confirmed by the officials of the Ministry of Health.
9.     Financially, the center is doing very well. Receipts have been rising about 10% per
month and have reached over FC1 million for the month of January 1993. About 30% of receipts
come from direct consultations with the doctor (bypassing the triage stage). This amount will
enable the center not only to cover all recurrent costs but also to establish a reserve for minor and
major maintenance and equipment purchase. The budget of the health center (proposed 1993) is
attached. Although the salary of the doctor is at present paid by UNDP, the center expects to be
able to fully make up the difference from the receipts once the doctor reverts to the public service
at the end of the project in 1994.
10.    Satisfaction with the services provided is indicated by the steady and continuing rise in
utilization and by the fact that at present (early 1993) about half of all patients come from outside
the catchment area of the center. This demonstrates the willingness and ability of the population
of Grande Comore to pay for services that are perceived to be of high quality and reliable. Note:
if all health centers were similarly improved, Mitsoudje would lose some of these clients,
reducing the efficiency of its services and receipts, especially in dentistry.



95
ANNEX IX
Page 3 of 4
11.    Although the center now sees significantly more patients than most health centers in
Comoros, and this number continues to increase, the total utilization has not yet achieved more
than a relatively low level of utilization relative to population (about one visit per year per person
in the catchment area), and only about a quarter of childbirths take place in the center. There is
no system of house calls by center staff. The bed occupancy rate is very low (about 10%). The
center appears, like many in Comoros, to be oversized and possibly overstaffed.
12.   The report comments that Mitsoudje remains, like most health centers, isolated from the
levels above and below it. It does not have technical supervision from above, nor does it
supervise the 2 health posts in its area. Feedback on referrals is poor between the health center
and the hospital.
13.    Some lessons: (1) Local surveys and extensive training were important in providing the
center with policies and skills that are suited to their local environment. (2) Real results are
achievable, but the time taken may be longer than expected.
14.    Some caveats: (1) Not all communities are as financially able as that of Mitsoudje, and
tariffs must be set at the facility level to adjust for this. Consequently, the government must keep
an eye on where subsidies are needed, especially for major maintenance and investment. (2) Not
all communities are as cohesive as those of the Grande Comore. More time and effort may be
required on the other islands to bring the community into the management of the centers. (3)
The presence of a doctor has been very important for the credibility of the services. Not all
health centers at present have a doctor. (4) The centers must have real responsibility over
personnel, as is the case at Mitsoudje. (5) A good quality facility manager is very important,
and most in place would need significant retraining to fulfill this task. At Mitsoudje the manager
is a qualified accountant, but this is not considered necessary.

MINISTERE DE LA SANTE PUBLIQUE                     A l'attention de
Monsieur Fransisco Aguirre-Sacasa
Directeur du Departement IlIl
R6gion Afrique, Banque Mondiale
Washington D.C.
Objet: Politique de d6veloppement Sanitaire aux Comores
Monsieur le Directeur,
1.   J'ai l'honneur de porter a votre connaissance par la pr6sente, les politiques
et les strat6gies que le Gouvernement de la Republique F6d6rale Islamique des
Comores entend poursuivre afin d'accro?tre l'efficacit6 des actions men6es dans
les domaines de la Sante et de la population.
2.   Depuis son accession a la souverainete internationale en 1975, le pays s'est
fixe comme objectif d'assurer un niveau acceptable de soins de sante pour tous ses
habitants. La politique sanitaire des dix dernieres ann6es a et6 ax6e sur les soins
de sante primaires, mettant I'accent sur la disponibilit6 A 1'6chelon le plus
periph6rique, d'un ensemble de services de sant6 prioritaires. Ainsi, conform6ment
A 1'esprit de la declaration d'Alma-Ata, nos efforts ont-ils privilegie (a)
I'immunisation de tous les enfants contre les six maladies cibles du Programme
Elargi de Vaccinations, (b) La disponibilit6 et I'accessibilite universelle aux
medicaments essentiels sur tout le territoire, (c) la surveillanc6 correcte des
grossesses et des accouchements, (d) I'accbs aux m6thodes modernes
d'espacement et de controle des naissances et (e) La prevention, la surveillance et
le controle des principales endemies, et epid6mies, notamment le paludisme a
Plasmodium Falciparum, la filariose et les maladies sexuellement transmissibles y
compris le SIDA.
3.   Malgre des succes signicatifs et I'appui important d'organismes d'assistance
et de bailleurs de fonds de la communaut6 internationale (PNUD, OMS, UNICEF,
FNUAP, CEE, COOPERATION FRANCAISE, APEFE, CARE, LIGUE ISLAMIQUE,
BANQUE MONDIALE, BANQUE AFRICAINE DE DEVELOPPEMENT, etc.. .la
Republique Fed6rale Islamique des Comores doit deployer des efforts additionnels
afin d'atteindre l'objectif de la sante pour tous, mentionne plus haut. Les taux de
mortalite se trouvent encore a des niveaux inacceptables. La situation qui prevaut
a l'heure actuelle est caracteris6e par la precarit6 de 1'etat de sante des
populations, notamment des femmes en age de procreer et des enfants. La
pathologie demeure dominee par le paludisme, les infections respiratoires aigues,
les maladies diarrheiques, les maladies sexuellement transmissibles, ainsi que par
d'autres maladies infectieuses et parasitaires. Les difficult6s socio-6conomiques du
pays aussi bien que l'organisation et le fonctionnement du systeme de sante
limitent l'acces des groupes A risque aux soins primaires de bonne qualit6.

Page 2 of 6
- Plan National de Developpement Sanitaire.
4.    Depuis mai 1991, le pays s'est dote d'un Plan Sanitaire qui definit les
grandes orientations et les axes prioritaires de la politique Sanitaire dans la
perspective de l'an 2000. Les activites et les programmes prioritaires poursuivront
les  memes  objectifs  que  par  le  pass6,  a  savoir:  la  promotion  par
l'information,l1'ducation et la communication, des comportements favorables a la
sante, la prestation des services de sant6 maternelle et infantile, y compris les
vaccinations, la surveillance pr6- et peri-natale et la planification familiale, la lutte
contre les eridemies et les 6pidemies, en particulier le paludisme, les infections
respiratoires aigues, les maladies diarrh6iques, les maladies sexuellement
transmissibles et le SIDA; et enfin l'approvisionnement et la fabrication locale de
medicaments essentiels,  notamment par le d6veloppement du reseau des
pharmacies mises en place selon la strategie de l'lnitiative de BAMAKO.
5.   Toutefois, la forte croissance demographique des Comores et la structure de
la population (le rapport d'age est tr6s d6plac6 au ben6fice des classes d'fge les
plus jeunes) requierent une attention toute particuliere car ils soulevent des
problemes sp6cifiques dans l'organisation des services et en matiere d'education
pour la sant6: on pensera en particulier aux complications sanitaires dont souffrent
beaucoup de femmes en age de procreer ( trop d'enfants, trop rapproches, meres
trop jeunes ou au contraire trop agees.) Nous d6velopperons donc des efforts
particuliers dans le secteur de la planification familiale et de la population, appuyes
dans notre action. Notre strategie en la matiere s'organisera selon deux axes:
I'IEC, cibi6e sur des groupes sensibles ( femmes de 15 a 49 ans et leurs maris,
jeunes, leaders d'opinions) sera renforcee et 61argie; I'accbs aux m6thodes
modernes d'espacement de controle des naissances et aux fournitures
correspondantes sera g6neralise. Notre objectif est d'ameliorer le taux actuel
d'utilisation des moyens modernes de regulation et de parvenir a un taux de 20%
d'utilisatrices/ utilisateurs en I'an 2000.
- R&organisation du systeme de sant6
6.    Au terme d'une periode de plus de quinze ann6es, les responsables
politiques du pays ont duj prendre acte d'une evolution irreversible de la demande
de soins , de pr6vention des maladies et de protection de la sante. L'augmentation
continue des depenses de sante, la volont6 et la capacite de participation de la
population a la resolution des problemes de sante impose une profonde et rapide
reorganisation du systeme comorien.Pour des raisons qui tiennent a la fois des
choix de societ6 effectues en R6publique Federale Islamique des Comores et des
capacit6s 6conomiques et sociales du pays, il est devenu evident qu'au cours des
prochaines annees, la politique nationale de la sante devra s'appuyer sur le
developpement concerte du secteur public, du secteur prive, et communautaire
meme si le secteur public a pour mission de constituer toute l'armature du
systeme.
7.    Afin de faciliter la mise en oeuvre de ce developpement, le Gouvernement
a decid6 d'initier un ensemble de reformes institutionnelles qui concernent tous les
niveaux de notre systeme sanitaire. Son objectif est d'offrir a 1'ensemble de la
population l'acces a des soins de qualite et a une protection toujours efficace,
associant  les  possibilit6s   combin6es   d'une   accessibilite  g6neralis6e
independamment des ressources et du statut social d'une part, et d'un libre choix
6ventuel a l'initiative de l'utilisateur, d'autre part.

Page 3 of 6
Une ioi-cadre permettra de d6finir les conditions dans lesquelles les secteurs
publics, priv6 et communautaire pourront s'organiser et se d6velopper en foncion
des besoins et des moyens du pays.
8.   Pour assurer un developpement coh6rent du secteur priv6, et communautaire
I'ETAT mettra en place les organismes professionnels charg6s d'organiser
et de contr6ler la pratique priv6e des professions m6dicales ( medecins, sages-
femmes, infirmieres, pharmaciens, para-medicaux) et 6tablira les regles regissants
les autorisations des installations, des constructions et des equipements.
9.   Pour ce qui concerne le secteur public, la strat6gie d6veloppee mettra un
accent particulier sur l'amelioration de la qualit6 des services fournis a la
population. Elle impliquera: (a) la rehabilitation des structures sanitaires, (b) la
fourniture d'equipements et de materiels essentiels pour garantir la coherence et
la continuit6 des services prioritaires, (c) ia formation pertinente et la r6partition
adequate des personnels de sant6 et (d) la mise en place de proc6dures de suivi et
d'6valuation des activit6s sur le terrain. La mise en oeuvre de cette strat6gie
n6cessitera un recours plus important au financement exterieur mais elle permettra
d'assurer une meilleure protection de la population et de maintenir, voire de
restaurer sa confiance dans un systeme qui joue un r6le essentiel dans le
d6veloppement du bien-etre economique et social du pays. (e) -Le maintien de la
carte sanitaire actuelle et l'interdiction de toute construction de nouvelle formation
Sanitaire avant l'an 2000.
- Reforme institutionnelle et statutaire du secteur oublic
10.  Pour parer aux graves difficuites de fonctionnement qui se sont manifest6es
ces dernieres annees dans le secteur public,et pour lui donner toute la souplesse
de fonctionnement et d'adaptation n6cessaire a une evolution  rapide de la
demande et des techniques, le Gouvernement a entrepris une profonde r6forme
institutionnelle et statutaire de ce secteur.D'une maniere gen6rale, un accent
particulier est mis sur la rationalisation du systeme sant6 et sur l'adaptation du
secteur public aux realit6s demographiques et socio-economiques regionales. A cet
effet, les services et les structures de soins et de prevention relevant du Ministere
de la Sant6 Publique seront replaces dans un dispositif pyramidal hi6rarchise ou les
services de sant6 periph6riques seront etablis a partir du Centre de Sant6 de
district, veritable f6derateur des activit6s sanitaires effectuees par lui et par les
postes de Sante qui lui seront r6f6r6s, y compris la distribution des m6dicaments
reconnus essentiels. Chacun des centres de sant6 de district sera lui-meme r6f6re
pour ses activit6s m6dicales et soignantes au centre hospitalier Regional (CHR)
situe dans le chef-lieu de sa region, et son action sanitaire sera coordonnee avec
celles des autres centres de sant6 de la region par l'interm6diaire des structures
relevant de la direction Regionale de la Sant6 et des Affaires Sociales.



ANNEX XII
Page 4 of 6
11.  Dans le souci d'accro^tre la rentabilite des moyens mis en oeuvre et
conformement a l'esprit de la Declaration d'Alma-Ata, le Gouvernement organisera
l'offre des services sur le principe de l'integration des activites des programmes
verticaux nationaux, en remplacant progressivement les equipes mobiles par des
elements polyvalents et integres au sein des 6quipes chargees du fonctionnement
des services de sante peripheriques.
12.  La distribution des soins de sante par le secteur public s'appuiera sur une
responsabilisation accrue des cadres de la sante et des communaut6s et sur une
participation directe a la gestion des structures, ainsi que sur un dispositif de
financement combinant des ressources locales, nationales et eventuellement
exterieures a des financements assures sur le budget de l'Etat. Les 6l6ments
critiques essentiels de cette participation communautaire seront la decentralisation,
I'intensification des activites d'information, d'education et de communication a
tous les niveaux, la generalisation du principe du recouvrement des couts, la
dotation de toutes les formations sanitaires d'une autonomie de gestion financiere
et administrative avec integration des representants des communautes dans les
instances de d6liberation et de d6cision.
13.  Les formations sanitaires  seront dotees d'un statut et d'un ensemble
d'instruments juridiques conformes a leurs missions et a l'exercice de cette
autonomie. La volonte d'etablir et de garantir l'efficacite de la gestion des centres
hospitaliers regionaux se materialisera notamment par leur transformation en
Etablissements Publics Hospitaliers dotes de la personnalite morale, conformes aux
dispositions des textes legislatifs en vigueur.
Ces etablissements seront dotes d'un Conseil d'Administration qui assurera
le contr6le direct du fonctionnement et de l'usage des ressources allouees et de
recettes apportees par la tarification officielle des actes effectues. Ces conseils
seront composes de trois categories de membres, a savoir: des representants des
collectivites territoriales, des representants des personnels de I'etablissement et des
personnalites exterieures reconnues pour leur competence et leur interet dans l'un
des domaines touchant au fonctionnement et aux activit6s du centre hospitalier
Regional. Les representants regionaux du ministere criarge de la sant6 assisteront
aux r6unions du Conseil d'Administration et y feront entendre la voix et les
observations du ministere, en particulier en ce qui concernera le budget de
fonctionnement, les equipements et la politique de developpement.
L'Etat pourra allouer des subventions en particulier pour I'acquisition
d'equipements lourds et pour la realisation de travaux d'am6nagement ou
d'extension. II participera directement au financement des activites de chaque
etablissement hospitalier en mettant a sa disposition, un effectif de personnels
agents de l'Etat, de toutes disciplines, places sous I'autorite hierarchique des
responsables de la direction du centre hospitalier Regional.
Des conventions pourront soutenir la realisation d'activites specifiques a
l'etablissement au regard des besoins regionaux ou nationaux.

14.  Les Centres de Sante, (CS) les centres medico-urbains (CMU)et les centres
medico-chirurgicaux (CMC) se verront dotes dans le meme temps du statut
d'Etablissements prives sans but lucratif avec des missions de service public.
Confies a des associations sans but lucratif cr6es a cet effet et agr6es par le
ministere charg6 de la sante, ces centres disposeront des moyens n6cessaires a
leur fonctionnement par le biais de dotation en personnels et en credits provenant
du budget de l'Etat et affectes par convention et par le droit a percevoir le montant
d'actes tarifes. La gestion des Postes de Sante sera confiee a des associations
villageoises de soutien, qui se verront par convention, autoris6es a percevoir le
montant d'actes tarif6s pour en couvrir les frais de fonctionnement. La participation
de I'Etat, outre la prise en charge eventuelle de travaux de construction ou de
rehabilitation, s'exprimera par des moyens affectes au poste au sein du budget du
centre de sante de reference.
1 5.  Les depenses engag6es par le Gouvernement pour participer au financement
de ce dispositif devront se maintenir au niveau r6el des engagements reconnus
pour 1992, soit au moins 800 millions de francs Comoriens.
20%  au moins de ces engagements devront etre consacres aux
depenses non salariales.
a partir de 1995 les budgets des formations Sanitaires seront alloues
sur la base des contrats existants entre le Ministere de la Sante
Publique et les formations sanitaires, et ce en relation avec le
programme des d6penses Publiques que le Ministere de la Sant6
Publique 6tablira.
1 6.  La mise en place de toutes les reformes mentionn6es ci-dessus n6cessitera
la formation en gestion des responsables des etablissements sanitaires et de ceux
des niveaux central et regional du Ministere de la Sante Publique. Des m6canismes
seront mis en place pour assurer une repartition adequate des cadres form6s et
garantir leur motivation et leur stabilit6.
17.  Pour r6aliser un tel programme, I'echelon national du Ministere sera
restructur6 de facon a lui permettre de:
i)   renforcer ses capacit6s d'appui aux r6gions sanitaires,
ii)   developper un systeme d'information sanitaire susceptible d'am6liorer la
gestion de programme de sante,
ii)   mobiliser et coordonner I'aide exterieure pour une meilleure utilisation de
ressources sectorielles.

18.  A l'echelon regional, la reforme consistera A la mise en place d'une equipe
de sante dans chacune des 7ies. Chaque 6quipe sera dirigee par un medecin,
directeur regional de la sante, et aura pour taches specifiques de:
a)    programmer et mettre en oeuvre 1'ensemble des actions de sante au
niveau de la region, y compris les activites d'information, d'education
et de communication a destination de la population,
b)   programmer et coordonner les activites A realiser dans les structures
de sante peripheriques pour satisfaire aux programmes verticaux
nationaux,
c)    promouvoir et suivre la mise en place des nouvelles dispositions
concernant la gestion et le fonctionnement des structures publiques
de soins et de prevention,
d)   veiller au bon fonctionnement de ces structures et y faire connaltre
les points de vue, les recommandations et les decisions du Ministere,
e)   favoriser la concertation locale, regionale et des partenaires sur le
fonctionnement et les orientations A donner au developpement du
systeme de sant6, en particulier par le biais de Comites locaux et
regionaux de Developpement sanitaire.

19. Nous sommes tout a fait conscients de l'ampleur de la tache entreprise, mais
nous y avons ete vivement encourages par les appuis que nous avons recus tant
de la part des organismes internationaux qu'auprAs de la population desireuse de
voir s'am6liorer et se consolider un systeme de sante pour lequel elle temoigne un
attachement constant. Nous ne doutons pas que notre action conduira A une
sensible am6lioration de la sante de tous et aux developpements des
comportements responsables en matiAre de demographie, de protection de la sante,
d'hygiAne de vie et de solidarite nationale.
20.  Nous vous prions de bien vouloir agreer, Monsieur le Directeur 1'expression
de notre tres haute consideration;
Pour le Gouvernement,
