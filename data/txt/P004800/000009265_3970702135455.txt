Executive Summary
1.          This Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SEA) addresses the inter-city highway
sector of the Kingdom of Thailand, particularly as it will be affected by project investments
under the Roval Thai Goverrnent's Seventh Development Plan. The World Bank is
contemplating providing the RTG a time-slice sectoral loan, termed the Fifth Highway Sector
Loan, to partially finance these highway projects. The highway projects are the responsibility of
the Department of Highways (DOH), which is part of the Ministry of Transport and
Communications.
2.          A World Bank SEA document overcomes the limitations of project-specific EAs
by addressing broader envirorunmentaL institutional and social issues. The SEA is not meant to
provide detailed project-level information, but does furnish guidance on EA preparation,
including methodologies for monitoring and mnitigation programs. In addition, the SEA
investigates the institutional capabilities and needs of the governmental agencies and Non-
Governmental Organizations (NGO) involved in the highway sector.
The Fifth Highway Sector Project is an extension of the Fourth Highway Sector
project providing a time slice of funding which would continue to assist the RTG with financing
to continue the Seventh Development Plan (and some carry-over from the Sixth Plan) for
improving Thailand's major inter-city roadways by widening to 4-lane standards; resurfacing
and restoration of existing roads to allow them to carry increasing traffic and heavier vehicles;
providing technical assistance and training; and supporting the procurement of various related
types of equipment for RTG agencies dealing with highways and the environment. The World
Bank would loarn US$250 million and the RTG would provide US$200 million to help finance
the DOH 1994-97 program which has been estimated at approximately US$8 billion.
4.          During the early 1970's, Thailand experienced a growing awareness of
environmental degradation due to rapid
industrialization and growing urbanization.
This awareness resulted in, among other   Pokc Chwrgesur NEA
things, the passage of the "Improvement and
Conservation of National Environmental   . .Localities aresgien -more -
Quality Act,' in 1975. This Act, amended in  responsibilities-and authorities for
1978, established the National Environment  environmental protection.
Board (NEB) and provided it with a

6.          The Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment has three departments
which are charged with environmental matters. The Department of PoUution Control (DPC)
within MOSTE has five divisions dealing with water quality, air quality and noise management,
toxic substances and solid waste, petitions and complaints, and a pollution management
coordination division.
7.          The Department of Environmental Quality Promotion (DEQP) is primarily an
informational department. Its divisions include the Environmental Promotion Divisizn, the
Environmental Information Division, and the Environmental Research and Training Center.
DEQP also has some responsibility to foster environmental education. The Office of
Environmental Policy and Planning (OEIP) has the most dicect involvement with the DOH. It
has the most divisions of all the MOSTE environmental departments, and these include the
Environmental Impact Evaluation Division which reviews EIAs prepared in Thailand. The OEPP,
through its Environmental Impact Evaluation Division, has developed detailed procedures for
the review of ELAs. Different processes are used depending on whether the project proponent
is in the private or public sector (or joint private/public ventures).
8.          The EIA review processes also include review by 'expert committees" which are
appointed by the NEB. There are five such comrnmittees at this time, covering the following areas:
Industrv, Mining, Water Resources, Hotels/Resorts, and Infrastructntre (which includes
transport). The committees consist of representatives of affected ministries, academics, and one
member of the public, usually represented by an NGQ.
9.         In the period from 4 June 1992 to 16 August 1993, the OEPP considered 344
projects through the EIA process. Of these, 99 (29 percent) have been approved, while 226 (66
percent) have been returned to the project proponents for more information or corrections. The
balance were still being considered as of August 16,1993.
10.         Another group which is set up by NEQA and which may have an impact on
environmental issues in the highway sector is the Pollution Control Commanittee. This high-level
committee is concemed directly with pollution prevention in the areas of water, solid wastes,
toxic substances, air pollution and noise. It advises the NEB and the Minister of Science,
Technology and Environment in measures to be taken to control pollution, including emission
standards.
11.         The RTG has made significant progress in the last several years in strengthening
environmental laws and regulations, particularly with the passage of NEQA. The institutional
framework for implementing this far-reaching legislation is in place, although not yet up to full
strength. The MOSTE's three envirornental divisions are working quickly to carry out their
responsibilities under NEQA, and should be supported with programs aimed at institutional
strengthening. These Departments appear to be under-manned in a number of key areas. For
example, the OEPP has a very small group in charge of reviewing EIAs for transportation
projects (only four technical staff), and as more of these documents are prepared in response to
NEQA, it is likey that a significant backlog may build up awaiting review. This will tend to
delay project implementation. The DPC has responsibilities to develop envirornental protection
standards, but does not currently have sufficient qualified staff to carry out the necessary health
and economic studies. They will need a combination of contractor support and cooperation from
other agencies (such as the Ministry of Health).

12.         With respect to the inter-city highway sector, the main impact of this institutional
insufficiencv will be possible delays in the review of EIAs, especially if the EIAs are prepared
in an incomplete or unacceptable manner. This indicates the need for improvements in the EIA
development capability of project proponents.
13.         Thailand has a multi-modal
transport system which includes roads,   DOH Seventh Plan Overview

17.        The DOH intends to use most of the proceeds of this sectoral loan for widening
projects as shown in Figure E.1 and as summarized in Table E.1, below.

18.         The major environmental issues associated with the Project are transportation-
related air pollution and noise, and the potential for involuntary resettlement of people along
or within the existing inter-city roadway ROWs. Since the Project will help provide financing
for many different individual projects, the specific environmental impacts cannot be forecasted.
The main concern under the Fifth Highway Sector Loan is that a process for the proper
evaluation of road-sector environmental impacts be in place within the RTG. This will ensure
that informed decisions are made regarding environmental impacts and mitigation measures.
19.         This Sectoral Environmental Assessment is primarily aimed at describing the
environmental documentation requirements, legal and regulatory framework, and the
institutional capabilities of affected agencies (primarily the DOH and the OEPP). Suggestions are
made for warranted project definition and screening procedural changes, mitigation planning,
training, and other institutional aspects of the environmental assessment process. Environmental
screening performed by the DOH and others for projects covered under this SEA is reported to
the extent that it has been done and is available.
20.         Chapter 3 of this SEA presents baseline information which may be relevant to the
environmental evaluation of inter-citv highway projects in Thailand. The SEA presents suggested
mitigation measures in Chapter 6 which can be incorporated into individual projects to reduce
or elimninate enviromnental impacts. An environmental monitoring program outline is presented
in Chapter 8 to assist DOH in managing the environmental impacts of the highways program.
21.         For a programunatic effort such as the Fifth Highway Sector Loan projects of the
Seventh Plan, it is useful to carry out a preliminary screening of all the projects based on the
potential for environmental impact. According to the current Thai environmental regulations,
the need to perform an EIA is dependent on the location of the project to the extent that it
crosses or lies adjacent to National Parks, wildlife protected areas, important water bodies, and
other sensitive sites. Because of this, an attempt has been made in this SEA to perform a cursory
review of all projects contemplated for funding under the Seventh Plan.

22.         This review was done as a desk exercise which involved careful examination of
the DOH 1:1,000,000 scale highway maps and looking for the presence of Wildlife areas,
National Parks, water bodies, and towns along the route of each project. No claim is made that
actual impacts are expected as a result of these projects, but their presence near sensitive
locations indicates that care should be taken in their planning and execution, and that in a
number of cases full environmental documentation pursuant to NEQA will probably be
warranted. The results of this preliminary screening of all Seventh Plan projects (except
Motorways) is presented in summary form in Table E.2, and discussed in more detail in Chapter
4.

23.         It is clear that the DOH is already doing a good job in some environmental
areas and is willing to conbanue to improve its environmental assessment procedures. The lack
of a large environmental unit within DOH may be a blessing in disguise since it affords the
DOH an opportunity to develop an agencrwide awareness of environmental protection while
still remaining focused on their primary mission to provide highway infrastructure for the
countrv. This can be achieved by a comprehensive top-to-bottom training program for all levels
within DOH  to inform  the managers,  engineers and other professionals of DOIEs
responsibilities under NEQA and other environmental legislation which may affect highways.
24.         It was observed that the current DOH procedures dealing with preparation of IEEs
and ELAs may not allow for these documents to be prepared early enough in the project
development cycle. As a consequence, projects are well along in final design or even
construction before an enviromnental assessment is done. At that time, it is often too late to
consider alternatives which may be more environmentally benign. To address this and other
procedural problems, a comprehensive Environmental Process is shown schematically in Figure
E2, which indicates the environmental decision-making and action process dunng the planning,
design, construction, and operation stages. Each action or decision shown in the diagram should
be further elucidated through written procedures and decision support documents to be
developed as part of the Fifth Highway Sector Project.

25.         Although land acquisition and resettlement is not considered a major aspect of
this SEA, a review of DOH procedures was considered prudent given the very large number of
projects involved. Current DOH procedure is constrained by instittitional barriers impeding
resettlement programs and illegal tenant relocation assistance. Resolution of these institutional
issues is necessary to allow DOH conformance with World Bank guidance on resettlement and
compensation.  Further, the procedure needs to be streamnlined, since the time required from
the inception of the acquisition process to final payments to land owners is quite lengthy.
26.         The OEPP is the other major
agency which may need assistance with    OEPP Project Proposal Objoctives
regard to institutional development. As of
this writing, the OEPP has forwarded a   1. Study.level of:environmental impact
preiminary proposal to the World Bank       resulting from highway traffic;
requesting assistance in developing better   2. Improve predictive (modelling)

considered and expanded in the resulting
Project. The primarv objectives of the
proposal are shown in the box at right.
27.        It is likdv that as the environmental documentation for the highway sector
required under NEQA is done more routinely, the OEPP will need to enlarge its technical review
staff. This will be particularly important once environmental assessment of the Motorways
Program and other megaprojects begins in earnest. In the area of monitoring, OEP? may need
to develop in-house capabilities, obtain contractor support, or coordinate with other agencies
(such as DPC) to fully carry out its duty for project review. The current NEB policy of
distributing the environmental review process among various agencies and expert committees
should be revisited as OEPP develops both the staff and the standardized techniques to carry
out project environmental reviews. At that time, it is believed that OEPP will have the expertise
and impartiality required for a successful EIA review process.
28.        In addition to training and technical assistance, manuals of environmentally-
appropriate technology and practice (in Thai) are needed by RTG line agencies and other project
proponents. This SEA contains only a very broad outine of the necessary steps for appropriate
environmental management in the highway sector. Some handbooks and guidelines are
becoming available through efforts of the World Bank and others and these should be adapted
to the Thai realities.
29.         A possible impediment to the implementation of environmental mitigation
measures as a standard process in the development of the Seventh Plan is that little information
exists regarding the cost. As a result, DOH may not be allocating adequate budgets for
envirorunental work If line items for environmental mitigations do not appear in program or
project budget requests, it is possible that funding will not be made available. A further
THAILA   - SECrORAL ENV=NMENTAL ASSEsMENT FOR HGHWAY5                  PAGE XVi



complication is that there is not a large body of data on these costs, so it is difficult to forecast
these needs at the planning stage.
30.         An approach to estimating these costs is presented in this SEA (Chapter 10). The
resulting approximate cost for environmental mitigation for Seventh Plan highway projects (not
including the Motorways) is presented below.

1.0   Environmental Policy, Legal and Administrative Framework
1.          This Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SEA) addresses the highway sector of
the Kingdom of Thailand, particularly as it will be affected by project investments under the
Royal Thai Government's Seventh Development Plan. The World Bank is contemplating
providing the RTG a time-slice sectoral loan, termed the Fifth Highway Sector Loan, to partially
finance these highway projects. This SEA is prepared in accordance with thc guidance for these
documents which has been recently established by the World Bank (World Bank, 1993b).
2.          A World Bank SEA document overcomes the limitations of project-specific EAs
by addressing broader environmental, institutional and social issues. An SEA looks at
environmental impacts of overall sectoral development plans and programs, and provides
information to decision makers which should allow them to make informed choices among
altemative programs. The SEA is not meant to provide detailed project-level information, but
does furnish guidance on EA preparation, including methodologies for monitoring and
mitigation programs. In addition, the SEA investigates the institutional capabilities and needs
of the governmental agencies and non-governmental organizations involved in the highway
sector.
3.          An SEA can also be used to assess cumulative effects on the environment from
many small projects with individually insignificant environmental impacts. The decision maker
can rely on the SEA to provide information on general issues which are of relevance to all or
most of the individual projects. This might include vehicle emission control programs,
regulations and standards, general public input regarding the highway sector, altemative
transportation modes, and the impac; of competing investments in other infrastructure
development programs. This broader perspective in the SEA does away with the need to address
these types of issues in project-specific EAs, thereby streamlining the environmental clearance
process.
4.          ThisThai Highway Sector SEA provides information about the RTG's institutional
capabilities, furnishes general guidance on environmental monitoring and mitigation which can
be applied to inter-city highway projects, and evaluates cumulative impacts of the Seventh Plan
highway projects to the extent that information is available about them.
1.1   The National Framework
1.1.1 Existing Environmental Laws, Regulations and Policies
5.          The Kingdom of Thailand is a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral
government consisting of a Senate appointed by the King and a National Assembly elected by
the people. An organizational chart for the Royal Thai Government (RTG) is presented in
Appendix A. The RTC includes a number of Ministries and other organizations which have
responsibilities in infrastructure projects and environmental matters.
6.          During the early 1970's, Thailand experienced a growing awareness of
environmental degradation due to rapid industrialization and growing urbanization. This
awareness resulted in, among other things, the strengthening the role of the Ministry of Industry
(MOI) in its responsibilities for pollution control under the Factory Act of 1969. Perhaps more
important was the passage of the "Improvement and Conservation of National Environmental
Quality Act," in 1975. This Act, amended in 1978, established the National Environment Board
THAILAND - SECTORAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESGMENT FRV HICHWAYS                 PAGE I



(NEB) and provided it with a secretariat named the Office of the National Environment Board
(ONEB). Implementation and enforcement of pollution control policies remained under the
Department of Industrial Works of MOI.
7.          Today, all environmental assessments and evaluations in Thailand are prepared
and processed pursuant to the "Enhancement and Conservation pf National Environmental
Quality Act, B.E. 2535" (NEQA). The 1992 NEQA effectively addresses a number of
environmental management problems which became evident during the decade of the 1980's and
which were not covered adequately under the previous legislation. The new NEQA provides
several important policy changes, including:
*     Localities are given more responsibilities and authorities for environmental
protection. Formerly, centralized power in environmental matters resulted in a
perceived lack of sensitivity or urgency in solving local environmental problems.
*     The central responsibility for environmental protection was placed under a new
ministerial-level organization, thereby removing the potential organizational
conflict of interest inherent in the MOl, which has a primary responsibility to
encourage and support the development of industry.
*    The public's right to be informed and to participate in environmental matters is
strengthened, both directly and through the involvement of NGOs.
D    The ONEB was abolished and replaced by three new departments under the
MOSTE, with authorities and responsibilities as shown in Table 1.1 and further
described later in this section.
8.          A brief overview on the RTG's institutional structure for environmental protection
is presented in Table 1.1. This table is based largely on an analysis found in Shetty [1993].
9.          Under the 1992 NEQA the National Environment Board (NEB) was upgraded to
the ministerial level, with membership as shown in Table 1.2. Non-ex-officio Members (known
as "Qualified Members") are appointed for a term of three years and can be re-appointed for one
additional term.
10.         The current organization of the environmental departments of MOSTE is shown
in Figure 1.1. The Department of Pollution Control (DPC) has five divisions dealing with water
quality, air quality and noise management, toxic substances and solid waste, petitions and
complaints, and a pollution management coordination division.

11.          The Department of Environmental Quality Promotion (DEQP) is primarily an
informational department. Its divisions include the Environmental Promotion Division, the
Environmental Information Division, and the Environmental Research and Training Center.
DEQP also has some responsibility to foster environmental education.
12.          The Office of Environmental Policy and Planning (OEPP) has the most direct
involvement with the DOH. It has the most divisions of all the MOSTE environmental
departments, and these include four regional operational offices around Thailand. The other
Divisions include the Environmental Policy and Planning Division, the Natural Resources and
Environmental Management Division, the Environmental Impact Evaluation Division, the Urban
Environment and Area Planning Division, the International Environmental Cooperation Division,
the Conservation of National and Cultural Heritage Division, and the Office of Environmental
Fund. The duties of each of these divisions are outlined in Table 13.
13.          Pursuant to the NEQA, Sections 46 and 51, the MOSTE (with NEB approval)

14.         The OEPP, through its Environmental Impact Evaluation Division, has developed
detailed procedures for the review of ElAs. Different processes are used depending on the
whether the project proponent is in the private or public sector (or joint private/public ventures).
Flow diagrams for these processes are shown in Figures 12 and 1.3.

15.         The EIA review processes also include review by "expert committees" which are
appointed bv the NEB. There are five such committees at this time, covering the following areas:
Industry, Mining, Water resources, Hotels/Resorts,and Infrastructure (which includes transport).
The current make-up of the infrastructure expert committee is presented in Appendix B. A new
group dealing with thermal and nuclear power plants is being set up in October 1993. The
committees consist of representatives of affected ministries, academics, and one member of the
public, represented by an NGO. There is no particular criterion for inclusion of the NGO, other
than the individual be well-informed and capable of expressing their opinions.
THAILAND - SECrORAL ENVIRONMENTAL AsE5MENT FOR HIGHWAYS                   PAGE 9



16.         These expert committees meet twice a month and review an average of three ElAs
each time. OEPP Division of Environmental Impact Evaluation does a preliminary review of the
EIA and requests changes or additions to the project proponent. When they are satisfied with
the format and content of the EIA, they send it to the expert committee with a recommendation
to approve or reject the EIA and the project. The committee does not always take the OEPP
recommendation. If they feel the project should be rejected it is sent to the NEB with that
recommendation. If NEB feels that it should be rejected, the project fate is left up to the cabinet,
which has the power to stop the project. It should be stated that the NEQA does not appear to
actually give the NEB or cabinet the power to stop a project, but rather it allows them to require
project proponents to conform to EIA guidelines and mitigation measures.
17.         In the period from 4 June 1992 to 16 August 1993, the OEPP considered 344
projects through the EIA process. Of these, 99 (29 percent) have been approved, while 226 (66
percent) have been retumed to the project proponents for more information or corrections. The
balance were still being considered as of August 16, 1993. Table 1.5 is a summary of these
actions.

18.         Another group which is set up by NEQA and which may have an impact on
environmental issues in the highway sector is the Pollution Control Committee (See Table 1.6).
This high-level committee is concerned directly with pollution prevention in the areas of water,
solid wastes, toxic substances, air pollution and noise. It advises the NEB and the Minister of
Science, Technology and Environment in measures to be taken to control pollution, including
emission standards.

19.          For new projects, a number of agencies-of the RTG have the power to block or
otherwise affect highway projects. These generally have to do with the agencies' responsibilities
and authority under various laws, and include the following examples:
*     The Royal Forestry Department in the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives
(MOAC) can deny permission for building roadways through mangroves or other
sensitive forest resources.
*     The Fine Arts Department in the Ministry of Education is responsible for
protecting cultural resources, and can affect roadway construction where these
resources are threatened.
*     The Ministry of Defence has control over Security Roads, and also can give or
deny permission for other road construction in security areas of the country.
*     The Department of Fisheries in the MOAC will intervene if new roadways are
likelv to impact fisheries.
THAILAND - SECTORAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASE5SMENT FOR HICHWAYS                           PAGE 11



*    The Royal Irrigation Department in MOAC, and the Harbor Department in the
Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) control roadway crossings
of irrigation canals and navigable rivers.
*    The OEPP has indirect authority to stop a private sector project by not approving
the EIA. In theory, according to the law the licensing agency can issue a permit
to the project proponent even without an EIA. This implies that the licensing
agency accepts the risk and responsibility for the action. In practice, no agency
has ever issued a permit without approval of the EIA. The OEPP cannot stop a
govemment project, but can make recommendations to the NEB and the Cabinet,
which has the authority to stop such projects.
1.1.2 Evaluation of the National Environmental Framework
20.         The RTG has made significant progress in the last several vears in strengthening
environmental laws and regulations, particularly with the passage of NEQA. The institutional
framework for implementing this far-reaching legislation is in place, although not yet up to full
strength. The MOSTE's three environmental divisions are working quickly to carry out their
responsibilities under NEQA, and should be supported with programs aimed at institutional
strengthening. These Departments appear to be under-manned in a number of key areas. For
example, the OEPP has a very small group in charge of reviewing EIAs for transportation
projects (only four technical staff, see Note in Table 1.3), and as more of these documents are
prepared in response to NEQA it is likely that a significant backlog may build up awaiting
review. This will tend to delay project implementation. The DPC has responsibilities to develop
environmental protection standards, but does not currently have sufficient qualified staff to carry
out the necessary health and economic studies. They will need a combination of contractor
support and cooperation from other agencies (such as the Ministry of Health).
21.         With respect to the inter-city highway sector, the main impact of this institutional
insufficiency will be possible delays in the review of ElAs, especially if the ElAs are prepared
in an incomplete or unacceptable manner. As is evident from the information in Table 1.5, nearly
two thirds of ElAs being submitted to the OEPP are judged unacceptable and more information
or corrections are requested. This indicates the need for improvements in the EIA development
capability of project proponents. The Table also shows, however, that no highway sector ELAs
have been reviewed to date under the new NEQA, so it is not possible to judge whether ElAs
for roadways are being prepared in an adequate fashion. The environmental documentation
procedures currentlv in use in the highway sector are discussed in Section 1.2.5. Suggestions for
strengthening EIA development capabilities are made in Chapter 7.0 of this SEA.
77.        Discussions with OEPP indicate that no significant changes to the EIA procedures
for the highway sector are anticipated, with the exception of a strengthened public involvement
process. At this point, OEPP is considering how best to do this. In the interim, DOH and other
transportation-related agencies will be allowed to continue their current procedures. The NEB
mav intervene on a case by case basis if important issues arise.
23.         There appears to be a reasonablv efficient system of checks and balances with
regard to protection of the environment in the highway sector. This is evidenced by the number
of agencies which can affect construction of roadways which are likely to impact various
environmental resources such as fisheries, forests, cultural resources, and river crossings. The
road-building proponents generally must obtain permission from these agencies to proceed.

1.2   The Highway Sector Framework
1.2.1  The Highway Transport System
24.         Thailand has a multi-modal transport system which includes roads, rail, inland
waterwavs, maritime waterwavs, air transport, and pipelines. Roads carry the largest majority
of traffic, both passenger and freight, with road-to-rail ratios of approximately 9:1. Total road
lengths in Thailand are as given in Table 1.7, which also shows a further breakdown, by region,
of paved and unpaved Special and National Highways.

1.2.2 Ministry of Transport and Communications
25.         The transportation sector in Thailand falls under the overall authority and
responsibility of the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC), whose organization
is shown in Figure 1.4. The only transportation areas not under MOTC are pipelines, local roads
in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area, road construction and maintenance in municipal areas, and
feeder roads in rural areas. MOTC's communications responsibilities include the postal,
telegraph, and telephone services.
26.          MOTC is involved in the preparation of the transport portions of the national
development plans, which are under the overall guidance of the National Economic and Social
Development Board (NESDB). The fifth highway sector loan which is the subject of this SEA will
help to fund the projects identified under the Seventh Development Plan, which covers the years
1992 to 1996. The loan proceeds may also be used to fund projects carried forward from the
Sixth Development Plan.

1.2.3 Department of Highways
27.         The Department of Highways (DOH), is a division of the Ministry of Transport
and Communications (MOTC) and will be the primary user of the proceeds of the Loan. DOH
is one of several agencies of the RTG with a responsibility for road construction and
maintenance, as shown in Figure 1.6. The DOH is specifically charged with the administration,
planning, construction and maintenance of the Special, National, and Concession Highways,
which comprise about 27 percent of the total length of roads in Thailand (see Table 1.7). DOH
projects include developing the inter-city motorways, widening roads, maintaining existing
paved roads, and improving road safety. The DOH organizational structure is shown in Figure
1.7.

30.         Highway investment
by project type is shown in Figure

31.         The DOH  is also
responsible for the proposed new
Motorways  System,  shown           Figure 1.8   Highway Investnent By Project
schematically in Figure 1.10. The                Type Underthe SeventhPlan
current master plan calls for a total
4,345 kdlometers of limiited-access rnadways, estimated to cost 355 billion Baht (approximately
US$ 14.2 billion). It is planned that 198 kilometers will be built under the Seventh Plan, costing
14.8 billion Baht. Anticipated sources of funds for this program are from international loans and
from privatization, but not from the IBRD Fifth Highway Sector Loan.
32.         Although this SEA does not address the Motorways Program  directly,
environmental impacts from it are expected to be significant, and detailed environmental
assessments of individual sections as well as the cumulative impacts of the entire network
should be completed prior to commitment to the program.

DOH. The maintenance activities to be
carried out by DOH in FY 1994 are               EqJp.m             RotAre

34.         Construction accounts for
the largest share of the DOH budget, 61  Figure 1im   DOH Maintenance Activities,
percent. This share of the budget has been        FY 1994
growing significantly in recent years. In
1987, for example, construction accounted for approximately 50 percent of the DOH budget. The
actual execution of construction works is 90 percent by contract, and only 10 percent by force
account. The balance of the current DOH budget, 16 percent, is employed for administration.
.24 Department of Land Tr,ansport
35.         The Land Transport Act of 1979 specifies that the Department of Land Transport
(LTD) is responsible for all comunercial activities dealing with land transport. The primary duties
of the LTD are as follows [LTD, 1990]:
X     Establish policies for promoting public transport services, including buses, taxis,
and trucks, and improving transport technology.
*     Develop policies for road transport energy use and alternative energy sources.
*     Prevent or reduce road transport pollution, and conserve the environment.
<Establish poLicies for passenger and freight transport in urban, mnter-city, and
rural areas.
*     Establish policies for international transport.
*     Establish policies for the construction of transport terminals.
*     Establish policies for vehicle inspection systems.
*     Manage information systems for road transport, operations, and vehicle
registration.
*     Improve vehicle and road user taxation policies and procedures.
*     Formulate measures for preventing road accidents.
*     Promote compliance with traffic rules among road users.
*     Promote intermodal transport.
*     Direct and promote the installation of taxi meters.
*     Promote third party insurance programs.
36.         In terms of the inter-city highway sector, the LTD does not have responsibilities
for construction or maintenance of roadways, but has considerable authority over road users.
This includes everthing from vehicle inspection (for safety and pollution control), to taxation,
to insurance and other requirements. Environmental issues under the purview of the LTD are
primarly associated with vehicular emissions control and safety programs.

1.2.5 Environmental Documentation in the Highway Sector
37.         The DOH uses a three-step process for documentation of highway projects. First,
planners in the. Planning Division (See Figure 1.7) screen all projects through the use of a
checklist. This checklist, shown Appendix E, was developed by DOH ldosely following a
checklist developed by the Asian Development Bank [ADB, 1988]. Second, certain projects
require the preparation of an Initial Environmental Examination (IEE), also based to some extent
on guidelines from the ADB. Finally, a few projects will trigger a full Environrmental Impact
Assessment (EIA), currently following both ADB and World Bank guidelines. The World Bank
guidelines are as given in the Environrmental Assessment Soucebooks (World Bank, 1991].
38.         It is not at all clear that NEQA or the MOSTE notices (See Table 1.4 and Appendix
B) indicate that project size alone dictates whether projects require EIAs. Regarding size, MOSTE
Notification No. 2 states that "all
projects with equivalents to or above
the minimum  standard of rural
highway including road expansion"     ome P.r-n&ples for:Framing-Proecfs
require an EIA if they pass through  S       P

40.         The DOH has begun to include environmental considerations in its current series
of Feasibility Study Reports being developed for the major projects under the Seventh Plan. For
example, the Programming Section, Plamning Division, DOH completed a feasibility report for
widening projects affecting the National Highway Route No. 2 in the Northeastern Region from
Nakhon Ratchasima to Nong Khai (see map, Figure 3.1) [DOH, 1993a]. The DOH staff sought
informal assistance from the World Bank Environmental Consultant in Bangkok for advise on
the contents of the environmental work
41.         Completed in September, 1993, the feasibility report is the first to include a
chapter which provides an overview environImental assessment of the proposed projects, and
an annex with background information on land use, quality of life, natural resources, and
construction materials. Although there is no land acquisition anticipated for these projects, the
need to deal with potential resettlement issues (in other cases) appears to be recognized. A more
detailed evaluation of this feasibility-level environmental-screening process is found in Section
4.1. It is expected that this environmental screening at the feasibility level will continue for other
projects in other regions of the country.
42.         At this time, OEPP reviews only those DOH projects which involve sensitive or
protected areas, as directed by NEB or the Cabinet. These reviews are carried out by the Nabtral
Resources Management Division of OEPP, not the EIA Division. The Cabinet resolution of
March, 1992 classifies projects in the sensitive areas into three categories: those requiring an EIA,
those requiring an EEE, and those requiring only a checklist. Widening of roads falls under the
lEE category while rehabilitation and maintenance of existing roads require a checklist only
[OEPP, 1993].
43.         To avoid possible delays during the review process, NB in May 1993 divided the
responsibilities for environmental review of projects affecting sensitive areas among three
entities, as follows:
*    The EIA Expert Review Committee reviews all ELAs;
*    OEPP reviews projects requiring only IEEs; and
*    The Forestry Department reviews projects requiring only checklists.
44.         OEPP has developed specific guidelines for new highway construction and road
widening projects which pass through sensitive areas. These guidelines were made available to
DOH in June of 1993, and are reproduced in Appendix C. No major environmental documents
have been completed by DOH using the new guidelines to date.

2.0   Project Description
45.         The Fifth Highway Sector Project is an extension of the Fourth Highway Sector
Project providing a time slice of funding which would continue to assist the RTG with financing
to continue the Seventh Development Plan (and some carry-over from the Sixth Plan) for:
(a)   Improving Thailand's major inter-city roadways by widening to 4-lane standards;
(b)   Resurfacing and restoration of existing roads to allow them to carry increasing
traffic and heavier vehicles;
(c)   Providing technical assistance and training; and
(d)   Supporting the procurement of various related types of equipment for MOTC,
DOH. LTD, DPC, and other agencies.
46.         The World Bank would loan US$250 million and the RTG would provide US$200
million to help finance the DOH 1994-97 program which has been estimated at approximately
US$8 billion [Gutman, 1993].
21   Objectives of the Fifth Highway Sector Plan
2.1.1 Background
47.         The Thai economy has been one of the fastest growing in the world in the last five
years or so. Thailand is now a major economic player in the Southeast Asia region and has
undergone significant social and political changes during that time. As an example, the
agricultural sector, which in 1981 contributed a quarter of the GDP now represents less than 12
percent while manufacturing has increased to 27 percent. The Bangkok Metropolitan Area
continues to grow in response to these changing economic drivers, and infrastructure throughout
the country needs substantial iInprovements. For Thailand to sustain its enviable growth rate,
large investments in infrastructure will be necessary.
48.         As the population has become more wealthy and urban there has occurred a huge
increase in the demand for transportation, both private and public. Roadway vehicle-kilometers-
travelled increased at a rate of 10 percent per year during the 1980's, and vehicle registrations
increased at a similar rate. When increase in road transport demand is combined with an
inadequate road network in Bangkok and between the major cities, the results are predictable.
The major cities in Thailand suffer from congestion, air and noise pollution, and frequent road
accidents.
49.         Air pollution in the BMR has worsened, and there is substantial evidence that
several pollutants (such as lead and PM10) are present in dangerous concentrations in Bangkok's
atmosphere. Traffic-related accidents have been rising at a rate greater than the increase in traffic
volumes. Inadequate or unsafe roadway designs, poor vehicle maintenance and undisciplined
driver behavior are among the reasons for the growing safety problem.
50.         The RTG recognizes that these problems can only be addressed through a
comprehensive and major effort to improve the trasportation infrastructure of Thailand. The
World Bank has partly funded a series of Action Plans under the Third and Fourth H-ighway
THwLAND - SECrORAL ENVIRONMETAL AssEssNT R'R HKIGwAYs                   PAGE 24



Sector Loans. These Action Plans address transportation-related air and noise pollution, road
safety, and transport industry efficiency. Under the Fourth Highway Sector Project, an Action
Plans Coordinating Unit (APCU) has been established at MOTC, and progress has been achieved
on all the plans but much remains to be done.
51.         Although spectacular traffic and environmental problems are evident in Bangkok,
the focus of this SEA is the inter-city road network, which is the responsibility of the DOH. The
current network generally appears to provide an adequate linkage among the major cities of
Thailand, but increasing traffic dictates that capacity improvements be undertaken. Alternatives
to these improvements are also discussed in this SEA.
2.1.2 Specific Program Aims
52.         The overall goal of the Fifth Highway Sector Project is to help the RTG meet the
continued rapid growth of transportation demand, specifically in the highway sector, and to
continue to confront the serious environmental and safety issues described above. To accomplish
these general goals, the following specific Project objectives have been established [Gutman,
19931:
(1)   Improve the quality of service of the road network through increased road
capacity and rehabilitation, strengthening, and resurfacing existing roads;
(2)   Provide for a systematic process of environmental evaluation at the design stage;
and,
(3)   Accelerate the implementation of actions to reduce environmental degradation
and vehicular accidents which are attributable to the rapid and continuing growth
of highway traffic.
53.         The RTG, through its Department of Highways, intends to use most of the
proceeds of this sectoral loan on the widening projects shown in Figure 2.1, and sunmmarized
in Table 2.1, below.

2.2   Environmental Issues
54.         The major environmental issues associated with the Project are transportation-
related air poUution and noise, and the potential for involuntary resettlement of people along
or within the existing inter-city roadway ROWs. Since the Project will help provide financing
for many different individual projects, the specific environmental impacts cannot be forecast. The
main concem under the Fifth Highway Sector Loan is that a process for the proper evaluation
of road-sector environmental impacts be in place within the RTG. This will ensure that informed
decisions are made regarding environmental impacts and mitigation measures.
55.         This Sectoral Environmental Assessment is prinarily aimed at describing the
environmental documentation requirements, legal and regulatory framework, and the
institutional capabilities of affected agencies (primarily the DOH and the OEPP). Suggestions are
made for warranted project definition and screening procedural changes, mitigation planning,
training, and other institutional aspects of the environmental assessment process. Enviromnental
screening performed by the DOH and others for projects covered under this SEA is reported to
the extent that it has been done and is available.
56.         The SEA presents suggested mitigation measures in Chapter 6 which can be
incorporated into individual projects to reduce or eliminate environmental impacts. An
environmental monitoring program outline is presented in Chapter 8 to assist DOH in managing
the environmental impacts of the highways program.
57.         Table 22 is a general summary of environmental issues associated with roads and
highways. The structure of the table is based on information found in the World Bankls
Environmental Assessment Sourcebooks, the Asian Development Bank's guidelines for
infrastructure projects, and other references.

3.0   Baseline Data
3.1   Description of the Inter-City Highway Sector
58.         The inter-city highways of Thailand which are to be affected by the Seventh Plan,
and which will be funded in part by the Fifth Highway Sector Loan are shown schematically in
Figure 2.1. These highways are primarily two-lane, paved roadways with unrestricted access.
Figure 3.1 shows the growth of highways in Thailand over the last 28 years [Sources: Padeco,
1992, DOH, 1993].
59.         The three categories shown in the figure are "Paved", "Unpaved", and "Other."
"Other" refers to roadways under construction and minor maintenance rural roads, and includes
paved and unpaved roads. As can be seen, the growth of highways has occurred primarily in
the Paved category, while the unpaved portion has remained relatively equal over the last ten
years. The 1992 figures were obtained from a different source as previous years, and do not
contain an "other" category.

60.         As shown in Figure 3.2,
the total length of DOH highways in
Thailand is fairly well distributed
throughout the four regions of the                                  N'E ist
country.                                   Norlh                     253
61.         In 1990, approximately 80
percent of the total paved road network
under DOH responsibility was surveyed
to assess its condition (approximately
35,000 kmn). Of this, only 22 percent was
in less than "fair" condition, and 10         Soulh                  26r
percent in "poor" condition [PADECO,           17%

much of which is potential or
between  latitudes  5027  and
20027N, and longitudes 97022'and

from   north  to  south  is
approximately 1,620 km, and from
east to west it is 780 km. Thailand
has ample access to both the
Pacific and Indian Oceans, with
approximately  2,700  km   of
coastline. It shares borders with
Mvanmar, Laos, Cambodia, and
Malaysia.

64.         The Southeast Coast, Region 2, is defined by the Gulf of Thailand on the south
and west, by the Banthat Range on the east (Thai-Cambodian border), and by hilly country on
the north. The overall character of the region is hilly, marked by numerous terrace formations.
There is a volcanic plateau west of Chanthaburi in the Tha Mai District.
65.         The Northeast Plateau, Region 3, is described as primarily broad river terraces of
the Mekong River and its tributaries. It is bordered to the north and east by the Mekong, to the
south by the San Kamphaeng and Dong Rek scarps of the Thai-Cambodian border, and to the
west by the hills of the central highlands.
66.         The Central Highlands, Region 4, is physiographically complex. [t includes varied
topographical aspects, such as hills, plateaus, peneplains, and river valleys. Of these, the Pa Sak
River valley is predominant. The region is bordered on the west by the North and West
Continental Highlands Region, and by the Central Plain. On the south are the Southeast Coast
Region and the Cambodian border, and on the east is found the Northeast Plateau.
67.         The North and West Continental Highlanris, Region 5, contains two sub-regions,
the northern hills and valleys and the western mounmins.The westem mountains form the
rugged border between Thailand and Myanmar. The northern hills and valleys are characterized
by parallel ridges oriented north-south alternating with flat, elongated valleys. The more
inportant valleys include those of Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Lampasig, Phrae, and Nan.
68.         Peninsular Thailand, Region 6, includes several distinct hill and mountain ranges.
The principal ones are the Phuket range on the west and the Nakhon Si Thammarat range which
continues into Malaysia, forming the principal feature of the peninsula. The mountains in many
cases descend to the Andaman Sea on the west, but the Gulf of Thailand coast contains relatively
wider coastal terraces.
3.2.2 Soils
69.         The soils of Thailand have been surveyed by the Department of Land
Development [DLD, 1972], and are summarized in Table 3.1 following the convention of
Arbahabhirama, et al [19881.
3.2.3 Climate
70.         Thailand is a tropical country, whose climate is primarily dictated by the South
and Southeast Asia Monsoons which blow alternately from the northwest and the southwest.
The surrounding water masses modify the results of these monsoons. Generally speaking,
Thailand has a "wet' and a "dry" season, although the northern uplands claim a separation of
the dry season into "winter" and "summer".
71.         The southwest monsoon brings moisture from the Indian Ocean, and occurs
normally from May to mid-October. The northwest monsoon carries dry and cool air from the
mainland of Asia, and extends from mid-October to February, although these times vary
somewhat in different physiographic regions of the country. The hottest time of the year is the
inter-monsoon season from approximately mnid-February to May.

72.          Temperature ranges vary between
the northern mainland areas and the southern
coastal and peninsular regions. In the mainland      2500-
sections, mean maximum temperatures during the
hot season range from 330 to 380C. The maximum
recorded between 1951 and 1980 was 44.5°C. The       20M0
coldest temperature observed during the same
period was 0.1MC. Daily temperature variations are
normally about 10°C, but wider ranges of up to
200C have been observed.                             l=0
73.          In the lower section, including the   E,
coastal areas and the peninsula, temperatures are
more uniform due to the influence of the seas. The
extreme temperatures recorded in Bangkok between
1951 and 1980 were 40°C and 8.9°C.
74.          Precipitation in the principal regions
of Thailand is shown in Figure 3.5, at right.

approximately 800,000 million cubic meters (MCM)
of rainfall annually, not evenly  distributed  Figure 3.5    AverageAnnual Rainfall
throughout the country. Average total surface
runoff is about 171,200 MCM, of which 89,995 MCM are in rivers, 80,775 MCM is stored in
reservoirs, and the balance is in natural storage [Arbhabhirama et al, 1988, based on work by
Dr. Pakit Kiravanich]. The largest river in Thailand is the Chao Phraya, with a drainage basin

of 178,000 km2, and average annual runoff of 30,000 MCM. This basin is the most important
agricultural area in the country.
76.          Groundwater is available throughout Thailand, but its quantity and quality varies
considerably from region to region. The highest yields occur in alluvium and terrace deposits.
Table 3.2 presents a summary of groundwater resources.

3.3    Ecological Resources
77.          The NEQA and NEB have specified that projects which pass through or are likely
to impact National Parks, wildlife sanctuaries, or other sensitive locations must have appropriate
environmental documentation completed before a permit is granted. Thailand's heritage of
natural resources is vast, but it is being threatened in some cases by over-exploitation and other
human activities.
78.          These natural resources include wild populations of both fauna and flora, as well
as their habitats. These wild resources can be self-sustaining assuming that man protects the
ecosystem. These areas include mangroves, other wetlands, rivers, marine environments, and
forests. They are valuable for many non-consumptive uses such as tourism, research, education,
and scenic beauty. They also contain economic resources whose value we may not even be able
to guess at today, such as tropical plants which can yield important medicines or wild animals
whose genes can contribute to the strengthening of domesticated animals.

79.         In addition, the natural resources of Thailand, particularly its forests (diminishing
at the rate of one percent per year [World Bank, 1993c]), provide a variety of ecological services
to the greater environment such as: control of water flow and soil erosion, contribution to
humidity and rainfall in the area, moderation of temperatures, and reduction of carbon dioxide
and other "greenhouse effect" gases in the atmosphere.
80.         Thailand has elected to protect its natural heritage through an ongoing effort of
protection of naturally valuable areas in Wildlife Sanctuaries and National Parks (See Figures
3.6 and 3.7, adapted from Arbhabhirama, et al, 1988]. Table 3.3 lists the 52 National Parks which
had been established as of 1986. Table 3A is a list of Wildlife Sanctuaries, and Table 3.5
summarizes "non-hunting areas." The ILJCN has developed a list of endangered vertebrates
found in Thailand, which is presented in Table 3.6.

direction.
3.4.1 Communities and Population
83.         The population of Thailand is growing at a rate of about 1.7 percent per year
(Figure 3.9), which would result in a doubling of the current population in 41 years. Total
fertility rate2 has fallen from 5.2 in 1971 to 2.3 twenty years later [World Bank, 1993d]. Infant
mortality has also shown a dramatic decline in the same period, going from 68.8 per thousand
live births in 1971 to 27 in 1991. Life expectancy at birth is cunrently about 69 years. Figure 3.10
shows the age distribution in 1989. Literacy rate for the country stands at about 93 percent.
' East Asia and Pacific is defined as China, Fiji, Indonesia, Korea, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Mongolia,
Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Solomon Lslands, Thailand, Vanuatu, and Western Samoa.

84.         As in most parts of the world, Thailand is becoming progressively more urban
in character. Figure 3.1 1, based on data from TDRI indicates that every region of the country is
becoming more urban, and that Thailand as a whole will see approximately 44 percent of its
population living in urban areas by the year 2010, compared to 25 percent estimated for 1992.
Although Bangkok will remain the predominant urban center, continued growth is also expected
in the other urban centers, increasing the pressure for better transportation links among them.
85.         The pattem of urban development in Thailand is clearly along the transportation
corridors (Mekvichai, 19901. In all cities land is fullv utilized along roadways to at least 10 to 200
meters from the roads, often leaving land behind unused or underutilized. This is not only an
urban planning problem but can lead to community impacts when even simple road
improvements such as widening are required.

3.4.2  Industry
86.           All regions of Thailand, with the exception of the Bangkok Metropolitan Region,
had agriculture as the major sector of production. Table 3.7 is a characterization, by province,
of the major Gross Provincial Product (GPP) patterns for the country. Thailand's major
commodity exports are rice, sugar, corn, rubber, and tin, and it is increasing its export of
manufactured goods. It imports machinery, transport equipment, fuels, some metals, and
chemicals.

3A.3  Land Use
87.         Table 3.8 is a summary, by region, of land uses in Thailand as of 1985 [based on
Arbhabhirarna, 19881. It can be seen that the country is still overwhelmingly agricultural in terms
of land utilization. Interestingly, almost as much land is given over to national forest preserves
(although this includes forest which has already been "encroached"). This once again points out
the need to carefully consider the potential impacts of highway projects on these protected areas,
as required by NEQA. There is so much land that is protected that it is reasonable to expect that
many highway projects will go through or adjacent such areas.
88.         Urban land uses, such as towns and villages, are also c ommon, although they
occupy only a very small fraction of the total area of the country. Even widening projects may
have significant land use impacts in these areas. Primary impacts such as relocation along the
right of way and noise from increased traffic are more likely, as are secondary impacts such as
undesirable induced development.

3AA  Agricultural and Mineral Resources
89.         Agriculture accounts for approximately 17 percent of the GDP of Thailand (refer
to Table 3.7), making this sector the second most important after manufacturing. The Kingdom
has a large potential supply of arable land distributed throughout the country. As can be seen
from Table 3.9, almost 57 percent of all suitable land is under cultivation. Suitable land in this
case includes areas generally unsuitable for economic crops, but that can be used to cultivate
special crops once appropriate measures are taken. If these marginal lands are removed from
the "suitable" total, the area under cultivation in the country increases to almost 74 percenL
Because much of the suitable land is already in use, any disruption to agricultural lands as a
result of highway development may be difficult to mitigate through land replacement. On the
other hand, the development of a good regional highway network will make it easier to market
agricultural products within the country and abroad.
90.         Thailand is blessed with considerable amounts of economically valuable minerals-
In 1980, tin was second only to rice in terms of foreign exchange earnings. By 1985, the
depressed world market for some commodities d,opped tin to sixth place behind textiles, rice,
tapioca products, rubber, and integrated circuits. It is unlikdy that highway construction will

have a negative impact on mineral exploitation in Thailand, but a positive impact may be
possible by improving transportation.

3.5    Quality of Life
91.           This section presents a brief summary of issues which should be investigated in
more detail for those highway projects which require environmental documentation beyond the
checklist stage. This is not meant to be all-inclusive, and other aspects of quality of life may be
important in specific circumstances.
3.5.1 Socioeconomic Values
92.           Improved transportation can have many beneficial impacts on socioeconomic
values of the community, and also some negative effects. As specific projects are evaluated, care
should be taken to ensure that positive and negative effects such as the following are addressed:
*      Increased employment due to highway construction.
*      Loss of property due to highway right-of-way needs.
*      Loss of beneficial use of properties which are not taken for road construction but
which become cut off from access or otherwise useless.
*      Improved farm-to-market and other trade transportation, resulting in increased
community income.
*      Improved access to public facilities, including health care, police and fire
protection.
*     Severance, or loss of access to some facilities by wide or limited-access roadways.
*      Loss of productivity from adverse effects of air pollution or noise from increased
traffic.
*      Increased traffic accidents.

3.52  Public Health
93.         Public health in Thailand has been improving steadily as the country continues
to develop. Life expectancy at birth has increased from about 59 years in 1971 to about 69 years
today. Infant mortality has dropped dramaticaUly, and health care is widely available,
particularly in urban regions. Highway construction, particularly projects that do not require
additional right-of-way, should not seriously impact public health. Particular projects should be
evaluated for their impact of the community's physical access to these services.
94.         A public health problem which is sometimes overlooked is the increase in the
spread of disease due to improved transportation. This problem should be investigated at the
national level, and measures taken to reduce this danger through disease prevention and
treatment. It is unrealistic to expect that highway construction will be reduced simply to prevent
the spread of communicable diseases.
3.5.3 Recreational Resources
95.         Thailand's significant recreational resources may be made more available by
improved transportation. These resources include the Kingdom's National Parks, its many
beaches and resort areas, and even urban recreation amenities which could be made more
accessible. Project-level environmental assessments should enumerate local recreation potential
and investigate the project's impacts. These imnpacts could include access problems during
construction, increased noise and air pollution for parks and other public sites, severance of
recreation amenities from neighborhoods, etc.
3.5A4 Aesthetic Resources
96.         Similar to recreation resources, aesthetic resources may suffer impacts from
highway construction, but will also make these more accessible to the public.
3.5.5 Cultural Resources
97.         Thailand's many cultural resources include religious sites, archaeological and
historic sites, schools, universities, and performing art centers. As in the case of recreational and
aesthetic resources, a careful inventory of cultral resources should be performed during the
environmental evaluation of specific projects. The DOH may wish to engage the services of
specialists in these areas to determine the presence of cultural resources and the potential for
harmful disruption.

4.0   Environmental Impacts
4.1   Environmental Project Screening
98.         The DOH currently does project screening in two ways. First, it completes
environmental checklists for all projects, and proceeds with IEE or EIA as warranted by the
checklist and as determined by the size of the project. Second, DOH has started to include
environmental issues in the feasibility study reports that the Planning Division prepares for
major projects. As mentioned in Section 1.2.5, this has been done for the widening projects
anticipated to be carried out on National Highway Route No. 2. Positive impacts were identified
as the provision of improved transportation efficiency, safety, living standards and quality of
life for the people of the region and nearby countries, particularly Laos. Negative impacts were
identified as destroyed plants, silt runoff, dust, noise, vibration, changing of the terrain, safety,
health, and induced development. Little specific information is given as to the reasons for these
conclusions or the methodology used to arrive at them. This DOH screening process could be
improved through the use of any one of several handbooks or methodologies in use in the
region or under development3, although many of these handbooks address individual projects.
99.         For a progranmmatic effort such as the Fifth Highway Sector Loan projects of the
Seventh Plan, it is useful to carry out a preliminary screening of all the projects based on
potential for environmental impact. In Thailand, as mentioned in earlier chapters, the need to
perform an EIA is dependent on the location of the project to the extent that it crosses or lies
adjacent to National Parks, wildlife protected areas, important water bodies, and other sensitive
sites. Because of this, an attempt has been made in this SEA to perform a c-rsory review of aU
projects contemplated for funding under the Seventh Plan.
100.        This review was done as a desk exercise which involved careful examination of
the DOH 1:1,000,000 scale highway maps and looking for the presence of Wildlife areas,
National Parks, water bodies, and towns along the route of each projecL No claim is mnade that
actual impacts are expected as a result of these projects, but their presence near sensitive
locations indicates that care should be taken in their planning and execution, and that in a
number of cases full enviromnental documentation pursuant to NEQA wil probably be
warranted.
101.        The procedure used in this screening consisted of checking on the highway maps
how many kilometers of a projects length appeared to impact sensitive areas. Water bodies were
considered potentially impacted if the roadway came within one kilometer of the water body.
This probably overly conservative, but it was not practical to attempt to look at smaller distances
given the scale of the mapping. A river or canal crossing was arbitrarily assigned 2 kilometers
of project impacting length. In no case did impacting length exceed the length of the project,
which explains why the interchange projects have very small impacting lengths assigned to
them. Detailed tables showing the screening results, by project, are reproduced in Appendix H.
The results of this prelminary screening is presented in summary forn in Table 4.1.
3 See, for example, the World Bank Sourcebooks [World Bank, 19911; a new handbook on roads and
the environment also from the World Bank IWorld Bank, 1993a]; a methodology manual in use in
Indonesia [Hoff & Overgaard, 1993]; or the Asian Development Bank's Guidelines [ADB, 1988]. Appendix
I also includes relevant sections of US Federal Highway Administration's Guidelines for Environmental
Assessment, which is presented in the form of flowcharts.

42    Cumulative Impacts
102.        The screening procedure described above also provides a rough indication of
cumulative impacts which can be associated with the Seventh Plan highway development project
(excluding the Motorways). While mindful of the fact that Table 4.1 reflects only potential
impacts, it can be said that the program may have the following cumulative effects on Thailand's
environment:
*    14 projects (out of 634) may impact Wildlife Preserves for a total route distance
of 164 kilometers.
*     16 projects may affect National Parks, for a total route distance of 249 kilometers.
*    Up to 180 projects wiUl pass close to or cross waterways, with a potential
impacting route length of 1,084 kilometers.
*    270 of the projects will pass through or otherwise potentially affect 584 towns.
4.3   DOH Land Acquisition Procedures
103.        Another  important
aspect of environmental inpact is the    DOH Land Compensation Examples
possibility of relocations due to land
acquisition  for right-of-way. The   Case 1: ROW Acquisition for Pran Katai - Bang

report indicates in the first page of the  1992. Compensation of Baht 3,334,251

estimates that Baht 7 biRlion (US$ 280   1991. Compensation of Baht 16,700 (US$

104-        DOH provided three
case studies which are illustrative of
the way the process acually works in situations where land ownership is not dear. These are

shown in the box above. Although final payments were made in all cases, it appeared that a
long and somewhat cumbersome process was involved. Cases l and 2 were situations where the
people compensated did not own the land to be used by DOH. Case 3 went all the way to the
Cabinet which ruled in favor of land owners. It is of particular interest because compensation
did not involve land acquisition but rather impacts to adjacent properties. This precedent may
need to be observed by DOH in project cases where highway construction impacts land owners
or nearby residents not by taking of property but rather by limiting its utility, such as by erosion
impacts or by eliminating access.
105.        Although land acquisition and resettlement is not considered a major aspect of
this SEA, a review of DOH procedures was considered prudent given the very large number of
projects involved. This process is summarized in Figure 4.1, and further detailed in Figure 4.2.
The land acquisition procedure appears to be complete. Historically the time required from the
inception of the acquisition process to final payments to land owners is quite lengthy. Recently,
actions have been taken to expedite the process. Because of institutional barriers, resettlement
is generally not addressed by DOH. Recommendations for improvements are made in Section
10.2.

5.0    Analysis of Alternatives
106.        This Sectoral Environmental Assessment investigates only those projects selected
for the Seventh Plan by DOH. As discussed in Section 1.2.5, no environmental considerations
were taken during the process of selecting the candidate Seventh Plan projects, so alternatives
between projects are not evaluated.
107.         Programmatic altematives to the Seventh Plan projects are not evident. The
nations primary highway infrastructure is in serious need of upgrading in order to deal with
demand that is there now, and which is anticipated to increase. Railroad and inland waterway
transportation are alternatives to a portion of the projected increase in traffic, but will probably
not satisfy the demand other than perhaps for the increase in goods movement. Air
transportation within Thailand is also in the process of being upgraded, and new domestic
carriers are competing for a small portion of the inter-city traffic, but this will not significantly
relieve existing congestion on many of these roads.
108.        The Motorways system, which should be the subject of a comprehensive
environmental assessment in its own right, will act as an important alternative transportation
network within the country. It is anticipated that this system will have far larger impacts than
the widening, rehabilitation, reconstruction, and paving projects investigated in this SEA.
Moreover, it is uncertain when this vast program will be completed, resulting in a gap of many
years before the Motorways can significantly relieve the inter-city network. For these reasons it
is believed that DOH should continue with the Seventh Plan program which it has developed,
while taking care to evaluate projects for their environmental effects on a project-by-project basis.
This would include developing appropriate alternatives at the project level. Guidance on how
to develop these alternatives is available in various references cited in this SEA [see, for example,
World Bank, 1991; ADB, 1988; Hoff & Overgaard, 1993; World Bank, 1993a]

6.0   Mitigation Plans
6.1   Mitigation Framework
109.        Potential adverse environmental impacts may occur during project construction
and operation. Impacts may result from the physical location of a facility, its specific design or
its operating characteristics. Some types of impacts may occur only during the construction
phase. Others may be associated with roadway operation. Negative project-related impacts can
be mitigated in several ways, including:
Avoidance - New roadways can be routed to avoid particularly sensitive areas.
Avoidance becomes more difficult where modifications to existing roadways are
proposed as with projects to be funded through the Fifth Highway Sector Loan. With
existing road projects, however, it may be possible to avoid some of the more significant
impacts with bypasses.
*    Minimizatina - The adverse effxct of impacts can be minimized through application of
appropriate mitigation techniques. For example, noise imracts can be minimized
through provision of sound attenuation barriers.
*     Restoration or rehabilitatioua - Restoration to the previous condition after project
construction or at the close of project operation is sometimes undertaken with mining
projects or projects involving construction activity in wetlands. Complete restoration is
difficult with roadway projects as the roadway will continue to operate long after
construction is completed. However, elements of the affected environment can be
retumed to their previous condition. For example, if a roadway project would change
an area's natural drainage, it is possible to design the project with culverts and other
drainage works to restore the affected drainage pattern to its preconstruction condition.
*    Preservationi - Some mitigation techniques allow preservation of the existing condition
in spite of time impact. Road construction which does not disturb subsurface archaeology
would be a case in point.
e     Compenisationi or replacement - Some impacts are unavoidable and irreversible. In this
case, compensation or replacement can be an effective mitigation tool. This would
include provision of replacement housing, replacement lands, alternative income sources,
or a cash settlement depending on the type and er',ont of the impacts on people.
110.        The mitigation strategy outlined here focuses primarily on means to avoid or
minimize impacts, with a secondary emphasis on restoration and preservation. Compensation
or replacement are mitigation strategies are best addressed on a project-by-project basis.
111.       The potential for impact or intensity of impact can be minimized through
incorporation of standard mitigation measures in the roadway design process. For example,
shoulder and culvert design can minimize the potential for subsequent drainage, erosion and
sedimentation problems. Incorporation of noise walls into the standard roadway design in areas
meeting minimum threshold levels of population density, proximity of residences to roadway
and traffic volumes can minimize potential for noise impact.

112.        Standard contractor specifications regarding work hours, noise, dust and erosion
control, worker safety requirements, living conditions in worker camps, procedures regarding
archaeological discoveries and other considerations can minimize potential for adverse
construction impacts (both direct and indirect).
113.        Mitigation planning for the operations phase can involve recommendations for
specific mitigative measures as well as broader legislative initiatives. Appropriate legislative
initiatives may be local or national in scale. For example, local land use regulations can control
potentially negative secondary growth impacts of newly paved or improved roadways. National
legislation precluding agricultural land use within a specific distance of the edge of roadway can
prevent food production on potentially toxic soil<.
114.        The mitigation process outlined in Table 6.1 emphasizes address of potential
operations impacts during the design stage and specification of means to address construction
impacts prior to development of the contractor bid package. Mitigation recommendations are
characterized by type of impact the measure is designed to address, optimal timing for
implementation of the mitigation mechanism, the type of area in which the mitigation measure
is most likely to be required, and the party responsible fo- design and implementation of the
mitigation measure. More detailed mitigation information and references for additional source
materials are presented in Appendix F.
115.        Because the Fifth Highway Sectoral Loan includes funding only for widening,
paving and other improvements to existing roads, the mitigation process described here is
appropriate in association with improvements to existing facilities. Many of the mitigation
measures and processes recommended also may be applicable to new roadway design and
construction. However, the mitigation process recommended here has not been designed to
accommodate large scale impacts potentially associated with new roadway development. For
example, the siting, design and construction of the proposed Motorways system may result in
a number of primary and secondary land development pressures, potential for massive
relocation, changes in community development patterns and major environmental changes
associated with changes in drainage patterns, animal migrations, etc. Project-specific EA's would
need to be conducted to develop programmatic and specific mitigation plans to address the
potential beneficial and adverse impacts of these projects.

7.0   Environmental Management and Training
7.1   DOH Environmental Training
116.       It is clear that the DOH is already doing a good job in some environmental areas
and is willing to continue to improve its environmental assessment procedures. The lack of a
large and influential environmental unit within DOH may be a blessing in disguise since it
affords the DOH an opportunity to develop an agency-wide awareness of environmental
protection while still remaining focused on their primary mission to provide highway
infrastructure for the country. This can be achieved by a comprehensive top-to-bottom training
program for all levels within DOH to inform the managers, engineers and other professionals
of DOH's responsibilities under NEQA and the host of other environmental legislation which
may affect highways.
117.       There is a danger that the presence of a large DOH environmental unit would
encourage the perception among planners, designers, and construction personnel that the
environment is someone else's department and therefore not their immediate concern. In
addition, it is likely that a feeling would emerge that the environmental unit's procedures and
requirements would be a hindrance to progress and cause unwarranted delays. This might result
in more energy being spent on avoiding or circumventing environmental requirements within
DOH than on developing environmentally-appropriate projects.
118.        However, the development of environmental awareness within DOH will not
happen unless there is a substantial increase in training assistance for developing the needed
environmental evaluation skills for guiding future planning and project implementation.
7.2   OEPP Institutional Strengthening
119.       The OEPP is the other major
agency which may need assistance with    OEPP Project Proposal Objecfiv
regard to institutional development. As of
this writing, the OEPP has forwarded a   1. Study lswl of environmental Impact
proposal to the World Bank requesting      resulting from highway traffic;
assistance in developing better methods for   2. Improve predictive (modelling) method-

World Bank (or other donor organization)                    Source: OEPP, 1993
further develop this proposal under either the
Fourth or Fifth Highway Sector Loan, and
that the recommendations of this SEA for
mitigation and monitoring be considered and expanded in the resulting Project.
121.       It is likely that as the environmental documentation for the highway sector
required under NEQA is done more routinely, the OEPP will need to enlarge its technical review
staff. This will be particularly important once environmental assessment of the Motorways
Program and other megaprojects begins in earnest. In the area of monitoring, OEPP may need
THAILAND - SEClORAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASESSMENT RR HxK;HWAYS                PAGE 64



to develop in-house capabilities, obtain contractor support, or coordinate with other agencies
(such as DPC) to fullV carry out its duty for project review. The current NEB policy of
distributing the environmental review process among various agencies and expert committees
should be revisited as OEPP develops both the staff and the standardized techniques to carry
out project environmental reviews. At that time, it is believed that OEPP will have the expertise
and impartiality required for a successful EIA review process.
7.3    Manuals of Practice
122.        In addition to training and technical assistance, manuals of environmentally-
appropriate technology and practice (in Thai) are needed by RTG line agencies and other project
proponents. This SEA contains only a very broad outline of the necessary steps for appropriate
environmental management in the highway sector. Some handbooks and guidelines are
becoming available through efforts of the World Bank and others and these should be adapted
to the Thai realities4. Manuals are needed in the following areas:
(i)   Poliky. Guidelines to assist decision makers at DOH and other transportation agencies in
the reorientation of economic and engineering-based policies so that they complement
regulatory programs for controlling environmental degradation within the highway
sector.
(ii)   Staindards. Guidelines for setting appropriate minimum  acceptable environmental
standards for highway infrastructure, with equal attention to affluent, poor, and poorest
areas. This should be done on the basis of an understanding of relative environmental
health risks and costs, not by simply copying industrialized country standards. These
guidelines would be used by DPC, OEPP and other environmental agencies charged with
enforcing NEQA, but could also be used by DOH and other infrastructure agencies to
develop their own environmental standards appropriate to the highway sector.
(iii)   Master Pannlaing. Guidelines for national, regional, and local roads master planning, to be
done with careful attention to environmental concerns. Additional guidelines would be
helpful for integrated urban infrastructure services master planning.
(iv)   Ecoiionoic AnalYsis. Manuals for performance of eco,nomic analysis of highway
development projects which take into consideration environmental costs and benefits.
(v)   Design annd Contstriction Maniagement. Manuals for roadway design which are "appropriate"
(which meet the need at acceptable levels at affordable cost), with particular attention to
ensuring adequate O&M, for all categories of development. These design and
construction management manuals would be compiled primarily for the use of design
engineers, but they would have built-in environmental safeguards (mitigation measures)
in areas such as erosion control, drainage, barriers and other safety features, noise
control, wetlands protection, relocation/resettlement, and protection of cultural resources.
(vi)   Einzironmental Impact Assessments. Handbooks for conducting ElAs for all categories of
roadway projects, in sufficient detail to facilitate wide-scale use and application of the
See, for example, Roads and the Environment: A Handbook currently beiing finalized by the World
Bank, and Hoff & Ovcrgaard 119931

EIA process. This would include the lesser level of detail of Initial Environmental
Examinations.
(vii)  Motnitorinig. Guides for planning and conducting appropriate environmental monitoring
programs, including all aspects of the community environment. These programs must
address quality-of-life, socio-economic, institutional, and financing aspects. They must
provide for periodic evaluation of the monitoring data for use in planning needed
improvements, and include establishment of an appropriate central environmental data
base adequate for assessing environmental quality in quantified terms suitable for use
by administrators, engineers, environmentalists, and economists.
In addition, as resettlement issues become resolved, the resulting policies should be reduced to
an appropriate guideline and/or rra al.
123.        Several reports and papers are already available on the integration of
environmental issues into infrastructure development planning. For example, the ADB has
published Environment Papers No. 1 and 5 which deal with project and program cycles,
respectively. The European Development Bank, the United Nations Centre for Human
Settlements, and others have also developed guidelines which address this issue. As an example
at the country level, the Indonesian Department of Public Works, D.G. Cipta Karya, has
developed under an ADB technical assistance grant their own guidelines for integrating the EIA
process (called AMDAL in Indonesia) into infrastructure development feasibility studies. The
World Bank's widely-used Environmental Sourcebooks provide a good starting point for the
development of these environmentally-oriented manuals of practice.

8.0   Environmental Monitoring Plan
8.1  Introduction
124.       This chapter provides a summary overview and some detailed recommendations
of the monitoring activities that should be instituted as part of the highway development
program under the Fifth Highway Sector Loan. The purpose of monitoring plan is to help ensure
that the design, construction, and operation activities that are part of highway development will
be carried out in an environmentally sensitive and responsible manner. Monitoring is a
continuous, structured process which has as its primary objective the identification of serious
environmental impacts which may be avoided or mitigated through early action. Some of the
monitoring procedures are general in nature, while others will only be done as part of the
construction process for specific projects. For these reasons, it is recommended that a structured
Monitoring Plan be developed by DOH as part of its highway development program under the
Seventh Plan.
125.       The monitoring activities to be considered by DOH for inclusion in the Monitoring
Plan are presented by environmental category and by time period (planning and design,
construction, and operation). First, an overview of a suggested monitoring program is presented.
This is followed by specific individual monitoring procedures. DOH mcnitoring is proposed
within the limitations of manpower and equipment.
8.2   Monitoring Program Overview
126.       The DOH highway development program is a large and lr.ngthy undertaking, and
its environmentally-sensitive management requires a comprehensive view of the many
interrelated components. Similarly, the recommended monitoring prcgram has been developed
in such a way that it can be managed as a holistic undertaking wnile still providing flexibility
to apply to individual projects as appropriate. Table 8.1 provides recommended monitoring
activities for the highw.ay sector, the type of each activity, the frequency of monitoring, the
performing party, and the development time period. More detail on each type of monitoring
activity is presented in Section 83. The major headings in Table 8.1 are as follows:
Monitoring by Environmental Topic - This column lists those environmental categories which
should be monitored. Not all of the topics addressed in Chapter 3 of this SEA will experience
impacts or mitigation measures which require monitoring, while others will have more than one
monitoring procedure recommended.
Type - This column is used to identify whether monitoring is required for a particular topic, and
the type of program that is recommended. Entries in this column include:
*    "None" - means that no monitoring is required.
*    "Spec" - indicates that the monitoring activity should be included in the contract
specifications, and will normally become the responsibility of the contractor.
*    "Standard" - refers to standard or routine monitoring which normally would be
done on a major project or which is carried out routinely by various agencies or
the construction manager. This is also used to refer to activities which various
divisions of DOH will carry out in a routine fashion during the development and
operation of the highway program, such as checking pavement condition.
*    "(xY' - a new monitoring procedure, described in Sections 83.1 to 8.3.12, that is
recommended to be the responsibility of an independent environmental
monitoring contractor or a monitoring group within DOH.

Frequency - This column contains recommended time intervals for each monitoring
activity. Some monitoring will occur more or less continuously, whereas other activities
will take place at defined intervals.
Performingr Party - Identified in this column are the parties recommended to bear the
responsibility of performing each specific monitoring activity, as follows:
"Monitor" refers to  the DOH  principal investigator for monitoring, an
independent environmental monitoring contractor, or another group within DOH
who will have responsibility for the compilation of overall monitoring program
reports. The use of an outside, independent monitoring contractor will normally
be limited to major roadway projects.
*     "Const. Manager" is the construction manager and/or field engineer who will
oversee the construction contractors on behalf of DOH.
*     "Contractor" alludes to construction contractors.
*      "DOH" refers to an operating or planning division of DOH other than the
monitoring group.
THAILAND - SECTORAL ENVIR)NMENTAL ASSESSMENT R;R HIGHWAYS                           PAGE 69



*     "Govt. Agency" indicates that monitoring of this issue is currently the
responsibility of a governmental agency other than DOH, and it is expected that
they would continue the monitoring in the future.
Project Phase - indicates when the monitoring should be done, i.e. during the design,
construction or operation phases.
8.3   Monitoring Plan
127.        DOH should consider developing a programmatic monitoring plan to address the
environmental monitoring requirements presented in this SEA and in any project-specific ElAs.
The purpose of developing this plan is to provide an efficient, comprehensive, and effective
convention for ensuring that highway projects are monitored for environmental compliance.
128.        This Monitoring Plan should consist of two parts: a general Highway Sector
Monitoring Program, and individual Project Monitoring Plans which will address specific issues
at the project level. These individual Project Monitoring Plans will generally be developed only
for major projects, or in cases where the Highway Sector Monitoring Program does not address
an important or unique feature of a project.
129.        This section describes twelve different monitoring procedures which are the
components of the Highway Sector Monitoring Program recommended as part of this SEA. Each
procedure may cover more than one monitoring activity, since many of the topics are closely
related. The following material provides a description of the specific tasks to be accomplished
for each monitoring procedure. DOH should adapt and refine these procedures for inclusion in
project-specific Monitoring Plans as each major project is implemented.
130.        In developing the monitoring procedure work plans, there are a number of
general common elements that should be included. DOH should develop and implement a
monitoring program which addresses the following aspects:
*     A clear sta'ement of the objectives and scope of the particular monitoring effort.
Objectives should include, as a minimum, the following: a definition of the specific
project(s) which are addressed; an identification of the specific activities to be monitored;
a listing of all organizations involved in these activities;  and a statement of
understanding which discusses the relationship of this monitoring procedure to the
overall monitoring program, to this SEA, and to any project-specific EIA.
*     A brief management plan should be prepared, containing the following information: the
name and phone number of the DOH principal investigator for each monitoring
procedure (the principal investigator should have the responsibility and authority to
utilize the staff and resources necessary to carry out the procedure); an organization
chart that specifies the names and responsibilities of individuals involved in this
monitoring procedure; a list of specific tasks to be performed, with resources identified;
a description of the methods to be used to assure the quality and integrity of the
information to be gathered; and a personnel work hour and equipment budget.
*     A schedule should be developed, including project milestones dates where available,
based on an understanding of the timing and deadlines of the specific activity being
monitored.
THAILAND - SE LMRAL ENVIRO}NMENTAL ASSESSMENT RIK HK;HWAYS                PAGE 70



*     The major products of the monitoring program would be a series of periodic reports to
be prepared (monthly, quarterly, or annually as appropriate) by the various monitoring
entities with the results of the individual monitoring procedures, and compiled by DOH.
These reports would contain comprehensive analyses and recommendations regarding
the conduct of the highway development program and the mitigation of its impacts.
131.        Although the monitoring program is seen as an in-house DOH function, DOH
may wish to retain an independent monitoring contractor to carry out many of the day-to-day
functions described in this chapter.
8.3.1  Monitoring Procedure (1) - Monitor Progress and Environmental Conditions on Other
Major Projects
132.        Other major projects in Thailand may impact the inter-city highway program by
using scarce labor or materia! resources, or by changing the need or priority for specific highway
improvement projects (for example, by providing alternative routes or changing travel demand
to an area). Other major projects may also increase public awareness of environmental or social
problems associated with highway construction, resulting in attacks on the highway program.
The work plan for monitoring procedure (1) should contain the following specific task
descriptions:
(a)   Develop information on baseline conditions, including a listing of all major
inf;..structure projects in Thailand, particularly roadways and mass transit.
(b)   Each month the DOH principal investigator (from the environmental or planning
group) should contact the project managers or other knowledgeable parties
concerned with each of the major projects. They should review the following
items of interest: actual progress versus schedule, resources consumed in the
previous month, problems encountered, available versus required labor, and
projected effort in the coming month.
(c)   The information gathered should be compared to the original baseline developed
above. Major changes from the baseline or from the previous month and potential
conflict areas would be identified. Announcements, public meetings, ground
breakings, building completions, orother milestones reached by the major projects
being monitored would be reported.
(d)   A separate accounting would be maintained of the availability of labor for the
requirements of the highway program, both during construction and operation.
Potentially large requirements for labor by other projects in upcoming periods
would be documented. The DOH principal investigator would document any
problems in obtaining needed labor which is experienced either by the highway
contractors or other project contractors. Recommendations for ameliorating these
impacts would be made, possibly including the development of training programs
to upgrade the skills of available in-country labor to the necessary levels.
(e)   The results of each month's monitoring should be summarized in the monthly
report of the overall monitoring program and compiled by DOH.

8.3.2  Monitoring Procedure (2) - Monitor Unearthing of Ancient Sites and Relics
133.        In addition to the general sections outlined in Section 8.3, the work plan for
monitoring procedure (2) should contain the following specific task descriptions:
(a)   Using the background information specified in Section 3.5.5 and any available
project-specific data, the DOH should develop a site-specific cultural resources
preservation procedure which should be made part of the specifications for all
construction contracts, especially for those that will involve excavation. This
procedure should cover the necessary steps which a contractor must take when
he encounters any ancient sites or relics, including notification of the DOH, and
immediate stopping of excavation or other activities in the vicinity of the
discovery.
(b)   Whenever a new site is uncovered, the DOH should note the occurrence and
notify the Fine Arts Department in the Ministry of Education. If so directed, the
DOH should mobilize a competent archaeologist or historian to evaluate the site
and recommend a course of action, in compliance with the applicable laws and
regulations. The results of the evaluation would be reported in the next monthly
monitoring report.
(c)   The DOH would check to see that the course of action, as approved by the Fine
Arts Department, is implemented by the construction contractor so as to preserve
and protect to the fullest extent possible any ancient sites or artifacts, while
causing as little delay as possible to the highway development program. The
DOH monitor would confirm that all construction contractorpersonnel, especially
those engaged in excavation duties, are aware of the requirements for the
preservation and protection of cultural properties.
(d)   The results of each month's monitoring should be summarized in the monthly
report of the overall monitoring program by DOH.
8.3.3 Monitoring Procedure (3) - Monitor Maintenance During Operation
134.        In addition to the general sections outlined in Section 8.3, the work plan for
monitoring procedure (3) should contain the following specific task descriptions:
(a)   During the operation of the completed highway improvements, the DOH
monitoring group would conduct a quarterly assessment of the quality of the
maintenance at each of the projects. The DOH principal investigator and his
assistants would visit each of the projects, conduct a brief visual inspection of the
sites, meet with those in charge of maintenance to review any problems
encountered, and document the results.
(b)   The results of each quarter's monitoring should be summarized in the next
monthly report of the overall monitoring program by DOH. In addition to basic
reporting data, the reports would contain recommendations for improvements
where they are needed.

8.3.4 Monitoring Procedure (4) - Monitor Impact on Businesses and Dwellings in the Region
of Influence
135.        In addition to the general sections outlined in Section 8.3, the work plan for
monitoring procedure (4) should contain the following specific task descriptions:
(a)   A baseline report should be prepared by the DOH monitoring group to establish
a specific list of businesses and dwellings scheduled for relocation or likely to be
impacted by the roadway projects, as described in the section on resettlement.
Much of this information would be made available during the screening and
feasibility stages for individual projects, but some would not be known until final
design.
(b)   During construction, the DOH should maintain careful records of the number of
businesses and dwellings by type which have been relocated or otherwise
impacted along each of the roadway projects. This information would be
compared to the baseline and reported in the quarterly monitoring reports. In
addition, the DOH monitoring group would report any unusual problems
encountered, including public opposition, difficulty in finding suitable
replacement housing or business space, delays, or other non-routine actions which
were necessary during the reporting period.
(c)   The results of each quarter's monitoring should be summarized in the quarterly
report of the overall monitoring program and submitted to DOH by the tenth
working day of the month following the end of each quarter.
8.3.5 Monitoring Procedure (5) - Monitor Illegal Settlers Activity and Develop Plans for
Removing Illegal Settlers
136.        In addition to the general sections outlined in Section 8.3, the work plan for
monitoring procedure (5) should contain the following specific task descriptions:
(a)   A baseline report should be prepared by the DOH monitoring group to establish
a specific list of locations which currently have or which may attract illegal
settlers along each of the project roadways. Much of this information should be
available from local field staff and project planners and designers, and the DOH
monitoring group's responsibility should be to compile the information, and not
to generate it.
(b)   A plan for the removal of illegal settlers would be developed by DOH, in
accordance with World Bank OD 4.30 and 4.20. This plan would be incorporated
into the baseline report by the DOH monitoring group, so as to provide a
measure for the success of the slum clearance program. The DOH monitor would
meet on a monthly basis with the relocation program manager to review the
actions which were taken during the reporting period and planned for the next
month to remove squatttrs from the DOH right of way. The DOH monitor would
then visit the identified areas and report on conditions there. Recommendations
for changes or improvements in the squatter removal program would be made
based on the experience gained.

(c)   The results of each quarter's monitoring should be summarized in the quarterly
report of the overall monitoring program by DOH.
8.3.6 Monitoring Procedure (6) - Monitor Air Pollution
137.        In addition to the general sections outlined in Section 8.3, the work plan for
monitoring procedure (6) should contain the following specific task descriptions:
(a)   A detailed implementation plan for air quality monitoring should be developed
by DOH, with the understanding that MOSTE has the primary responsibility for
air quality monitoring. Therefore, the plan should be consistent with the other air
quality monitoring programs currently under way in Thailand. The plan should
specifically address both construction and longer term monitoring, and sensitive
receptors such as schools and hospitals. In addition, a baseline of existing air
quality in the areas where major highway works are contemplated should be
developed. This should be done in consultation with the DPC.
(b)   During construction, the air pollution monitoring plan should be particularly
concerned with concentrations of suspended particulates (PMIO), since airborne
dust will be one of the primary pollutants associated with construction activities.
The plan should specify the necessary instrumentation, how often and for what
duration samples are to be taken (normally once a month for a 24-hour period),
and the monitoring locations for each major construction site. Of particular
importance will be areas of major excavation or disposal sites, where airborne
dust may be generated in great quantities especially during periods of little or no
rainfall. The sampling data gathered would be subjected to statistical analysis to
establish its characteristics and validity, and would be compared to baseline
information discussed above, and to ongoing measurements by DPC and others.
(c)   At disposal and tipping sites, the DOH monitor and the construction manager
should ensure that proper restoration techniques are employed so as to control
wind and water erosion. Restoration should be a part of the specifications of
excavation and hauling contractors.
(d)   The results of each month's monitoring should be summarized in the monthly
report of the overall monitoring program by DOH. These data should be made
available to DPC. In addition to basic reporting data, the reports would contain
recommendations for improvements to air quality management where they are
needed.
8.3.7 Monitoring Procedure (7) - Monitor Noise
138.        In addition to the general sections outlined in Section 8.3, the work plan for
monitoring procedure (7) should contain the following specific task descriptions:
(a)   A detailed implementation plan for noise monitoring should be developed by the
monitoring contractor. The plan should be consistent with the other noise
monitoring programs currently under way in Thailand, such as the programs
carried out periodically by DPC and the universities. The plan should specifically
THAILANI) - SEC7ORAL ENVIRONMENTAL AbSESSMENT FoR HIGHWAYS                PAGE 74



address both construction and longer-term monitoring, and sensitive receptors
such as schools and hospitals. Longer-term monitoring may not be necessary at
locations where sound-suppression measures have been taken, such as the
erection of noise barriers. Monitoring of individual vehicles is the responsibility
of DPC and others. In addition to the monitoring program, a baseline of existing
noise levels at major construction sites should be developed.
(b)   Each construction contract should include specifications for noise monitoring of
equipment and ambient noise at the site to demonstrate compliance with the
standards set by DPC. Contractors should be encouraged to use the quietest
equipment available, to avoid intrusive noise generation during the night (11 pm
to 5 am), to install temporary noise barriers near noise sensitive receptors, and to
limit truck hauling activities during the night. It must be recognized that a
requirement to use daytime hours only for truck hauling operations may have
serious negative impacts on daytime traffic congestion and on the project
schedules, since major infrastructure construction in Thailand typically takes place
around the clock. The DOH monitor should receive the contractors' noise reports
on a monthly basis, but should also conduct random spot checks of noise levels,
equipment being used, and sensitive receptors impacted. Recording hand-held
sound level meters may be used for the spot checks to record L., and compute
Ldn, as necessary. Measurements should be taken at the construction site
boundaries, and at sensitive receptors such as schools and hospitals within 200
m of the site. A minimum of 10 random locations per month should be selected,
but all construction sites should be monitored at least once every three months.
(c)   The results of each month's monitoring should be summarized in the monthly
report of the overall monitoring program by DOH. Quarterly monitoring results
should be reported in the quarterly reports and summarized in the annual
monitoring reports. In addition to basic reporting data, the reports would contain
recommendations for improvements to noise control and maintenance procedures
where they are needed.
8.3.8 Monitoring Procedure (8) - Review and Monitor Plans for Maintaining Access to
Schools, Businesses, and Community Facilities
139.        In addition to the general sections outlined in Section 8.3, the work plan for
monitoring procedure (8) should contain the following specific task descriptions:
(a)   For each major project. develop information on baseline conditions, including a
listing of all schools, businesses, and community facilities likely to be impacted
by the highway construction. This information is most likely to be available in the
local or regional DOH field offices, but may need to be updated based on future
development.
(b)   Each month the DOH principal investigator or his assistants should visit each
construction site which had been identified as causing potential impact with
regard to access to schools, businesses, or public facilities, and report on the
availability and safety of access. If problems are discovered, the construction
THAILAND) - SECTORAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASsE;MENT R)R HIGHWAYS                 PAGE 75



manager would be informed and he would instruct the construction contractor
to provide the needed access. In addition to these routine visits, any complaints
regarding access would be investigated through a prompt site visit by DOH and
action recommended to correct the problem.
(c)   The results of each month's monitoring should be summarized in the monthly
report of the overall monitoring program by DOH.
8.3.9 Monitoring Procedure (9) - Monitor Construction Impacts to Flora and Fauna
140.        In addition to the general sections outlined in Section 8.3, the work plan for
monitoring procedure (9) should contain the following specific task descriptions:
(a)   For each major project, develop information on baseline conditions, including a
listing of all flora and fauna resources which are likely to be impacted by the
construction of the project. Most of this information should be found in the
project's lEE or EIA, but may need to be updated, especially if there are
significant changes in the construction methods or alignment for the project.
(b)   Construction activity near mangroves, wildlife preserves, along coastal areas,
within river floodplains, near or through wetlands, or in national parks should
be monitored to ensure that these resources are not damaged, and that activities
are in compliance with laws and regulations protecting natural resources. The
principal investigator of this monitoring procedure should visit any such sensitive
areas each month during the construction of major projects. As Appropriate,
monitoring could include water quality sampling to determine changes in
suspended solids or other water quality constituents which would be likely to
impact mangrove ecosystems, wetlands, fisheries, etc. These measurements would
be compared to baseline conditions. In addition, the DOH monitor would note
any unusual changes in these natural areas since the last monitoring period, any
signs of environmental distress, and any evidence of direct construction impacts,
such as the accumulation of debris, damage to vegetation, or surface water runoff
from the construction site. If any of these signs are detected, the DOH monitor
would consult with the construction manager as to the cause and recommend
measures to mitigate or stop the impact.
(c)   Any areas to be used to dispose of spoil material should be monitored on a
monthly basis by the principal investigator or his assistants to ensure that there
are no unavoidable impacts to the vegetation or wildlife of the areas. During a
site visit, the DOH monitor should note the methods being used to access the
disposal site, provide for surface drainage, store and manage topsoils, and replant
the site, as appropriate. Any variations from specifications which lead to
undesired impacts shoufl be discussed with the construction manager and
recommendations made tor correction of the variance.
(d)   The results of each month's monitoring should be summarized in the monthly
report of the overall monitoring program by DOH during the construction stages
of the project.

8.3.10 Monitoring Procedure (10) - Monitor Water Quality Impacts
141.        In addition to the general sections outlined in Section 8.3, the work plan for
monitoring procedure (10) should contain the following specific task descriptions:
(a)   Develop information on surface water baseline conditions, including a listing of
locations where effluent from construction sites is expected to discharge into
adjacent streams. This information can be found, in part, in Section 4.1 of this
SEA, but would need to be updated at the project level. Sampling stations can
then be located at each effluent point, so as to sample water quality both in the
receiving stream and the effluent stream. At very sensitive sites, monitoring
should be carried out on a daily basis during construction so as to prevent or
limit sudden pollutant discharges into the receiving streams. At other sites
monthly sampling may be sufficient. Sampling of the instream water quality
should include a chemical analysis as well as temperature, pH, suspended solids,
dissolved oxygen, BOD, and COD. Samples of effluent should be analyzed for
their chemical constituents, including metals, pesticides, herbicides, and nutrients.
As the information is gathered, it should be reviewed for unusual or severe
indications of pollutant loadings and recommendations for their immediate
correction and control made to the construction manager and DOH so as to
prevent significant long-term damage to receiving streams. The data should also
be maintained in a data base which would permit the development of trend
evaluation, seasonal variations, or other longer term analyses. The DOH monitor
should analyze the sampling data and recommend mitigative measures if adverse
water quality impacts are detected. These results should be reported in the annual
summary reports of the overall monitoring program.
(b)   The DOH monitor should review plans to be developed by the construction
contractors that would specify measures to be taken to prevent water quality
impacts and ensure that proper treatment facilities, such as settling pools, are
used. Variances from the accepted plans would be reported to the construction
manager for correction and would be reported in the monthly monitoring reports.
(c)   Another possible water quality monitoring requirement (applicable to a very
limited number of projects) is the monitoring of any dredging operations which
may be done to provide fill for construction. Dredging may cause increased
turbidity in the river, disturb bottom sediments which may release heavy metals,
and impact the spawning of commercially valuable species. The DOH monitor
should develop a program to conduct monitoring of the dredging operations for
the entire period projected to be needed for dredging. This would include a daily
inspection of the dredging operation to ensure that they are done in an
environmentally sensitive manner, according to specifications built into the
construction contract. Grab samples of water quality from various depths in the
river downstream of the dredging operations would be compared to samples
from upstream. These samples would be taken periodically, at least weekly, and
unusual problems reported. Measures to control any such problems would be
recommended. The data would be maintained in a data base which would permit
analyses of seasonal or other longer-term events, and the information would be
reported in the annual monitoring report.

(d)   The results of each month's monitoring should be summarized in the monthly
report of the overall monitoring program by DOH during the construction stages
of the highway construction program.
8.3.11 Monitoring Procedure (11) - Review and Monitor Solid Waste Handling and Disposal
Plans
142.        In addition to the general sections outlined in Section 8.3, the work plan for
monitoring procedure (11) should contain the following specific task descriptions:
(a)   Develop information on baseline conditions, including a listing of locations where
excavation or other spoils from construction sites is expected to be loaded into
trucks for hauling. The baseline should also include a map with all the designated
haul routes, including the period of time during which it is expected they would
be in use, the times of day during which hauling would occur, and the number
of truck trips per day on each haul route. The disposal sites to be used should
also be documented in the baseline, and the methods for management of disposal
at each site.
(b)   The construction contractors will be required to develop detailed plans for the
loading, transport, and disposal of spoil. The DOH monitor should review those
plans to make sure that they comply with the mitigation measures for solid waste
handling. If the plans are incomplete or inadequate the monitor would make
recommendations for improvements and return them to the contractors. Once the
plans have been approved by the monitor, the construction conrractors would be
expected to comply with all the terms of the plans.
(c)   The DOH monitor should assess compliance with the solid waste disposal plans
on a daily basis. The monitor would rely to some extent on the support of the
construction manager to ensure compliance, since the plans would be a part of
the construction contracts. The inspection would include making sure that the
haul trucks are covered and washed before leaving the site. The haul routes
would be monitored in a similar way. Each working day, the DOH monitor
would establish a monitoring station at random along one of the haul routes, and
observe the condition of the trucks, speeds, and rate of truck traffic. These
observations would be compared to the baseline established for that route. The
DOH monitor would inspect each of the tipping sites at least once per week to
observe compliance with disposal and reclamation methods. As before, any
variances from the solid waste disposal plans would be reported to the
construction manager and recorded in the monthly reports. It is possible that
there will be other signs of environmental impact at tipping sites, along the haul
routes, or at loading and unloading areas which are not covered by the solid
waste disposal plans. These impacts would be reported, and the DOH monitor
would make recommendations for their control.
(d)   The results of each month's monitoring should be summarized in the monthly
report of the overall monitoring program by DOH during the construction stages
of the program.

8.3.12 Monitoring Procedure (12) - Review and Monitor Storm Water Quality Control Plans
143.        In addition to tile general sections outlined in Section 8.3, the work plan for
monitoring procedure (12) should contain the following specific task descriptions:
(a)   The DOH monitor should develop a plan for the periodic measurement and
analysis of the water quality of surface runoff resulting from storm water in
construction sites. It is expected that adequate drainage and sedimentation control
plans for construction areas would be built into each of the construction contracts,
and that the construction manager would have the responsibility of ensuring that
those plans are adhered to by the contractors. The monitoring plan should have
three general parts: the review and approval of the drainage and storm water
quality control plans; the inspection of sedimentation control features at the
construction sites; and, the actual monitoring of storm water runoff from
construction sites immediately during and after storm events.
(b)   The DOH monitor would review the plans developed by the construction
contractors regarding storm drainage management at construction sites and the
measures to control sedimentation. Suggested methods can be found in Chapter
6. The monitor would consult with the construction manager on the best way of
monitoring compliance with these plans. At a minimum, however, the monitor
would visit the construction sites after major storm events to verify that the storm
control measures were successful. Major problems would be recorded in the
monthly reports and would be brought to the attention of the construction
manager.
(c)   The results of each month's monitoring should be summarized in the monthly
report of the overall monitoring program by DOH during the construction stages
of the program.

9.0   Public Consultation
9.1   Public involvement in EIA Preparation
144.        Public consultation represents a weak, but improving, aspect of DOH
environmental assessment procedures. The NEQA addresses public information as follows
(official English translation):
Section 6. For the purpose of public participation in the enhancement and
conservation of national environmental quality, the following rights and duties
may be accorded to individual person as provided by this Act or governing law
related thereto:
(1) To be informed and obtain information and data from the government
service in matters concerning the enhancement and conservation of environmental
quality, except the information or data that are officially classified as secret
intelligence pertaining to national security, or secrets pertaining to the right to
privacy, property rights, or the rights in trade or business of any person which
are duly protected by the law.
(2) To be remedied or compensated by the State in case damage or injury
is sustained as a consequence of dangers arisen from contamination by pollutants
or spread of pollution, and such incident is caused by any activity or project
initiated, supported or undertaken by government agency or state enterpnse.
(3) To petition or lodge complaint against -offender in case of being a
witness to any act committed in violation or infringement of the laws relating to
pollution control or conservation of natural resources.
(4) To co-operate and assist government officials in the performance of
duty relating to the enhancement and conservation of environmental quality.
(5) To strictly observe the provisions of this Act or other laws concerning
the enhancement and conservation of environmental quality.
145.        Although Section 6(1) gives the public a right to be informed, the NEQA is not
clear regarding the responsibilities of the government for public information within the
environmental impact assessment process. This is in the process of being resolved within the
OEPP, and a study is reportedly about to get under way to establish public involvement
procedures which are appropnate to Thailand.
146.        There are large numbers of NGOs which have an interest in environmental
matters, and some of these are active in reviewing and commenting on projects. According to
DEQP, there are hundreds of NGOs, but a much smaller number are registered with DEQP
according to the NEQA provisions. Appendix D presents the current list of NGOs.

9.2   Public Consultation for the SEA
147.        The DOH has not as a rule formally involved the public in developing or
reviewing environmental documentation. This is not to say that the public and NGOs have not
been vocal in their support or opposition to specific projects over the years. Due to the
centralization of the planning and design functions within DOH's Bangkok offices, the people
in the vicinity of a project often do not get word of the project's existence until the contractors
bidding for the job show up at the site. In some cases, even the local DOH officials may not be
fully aware of the project's extent and so find it difficult to inform the public. For many larger
projects, design reports, plans and specifications are in English, so it is more difficult for the
public to truly evaluate a project .
148.        A small sampling of NGOs were contacted as part of the preparation of this SEA.
They were asked whether they had an interest in environmental issues conceming rural
highways, and if so, what comments or advise could they give. Most of the NGOs contacted did
not have a direct involvement in these issues, although they expressed interest in transportation
issues in Bangkok and in sensitive locations.
149.        NGO concerns were typified by a number of useful comments which were
received from Khun Witoon, Director of Project for Ecology Recovery, as follows:
3     NGOs believe that the government should consult more with local people as a
project is planned and executed.
3     I~The public in Thailand is not accustomed to participating, and may feel that the
government will not listen to them resulting in the relatively low involvement
rate reported by DOH and other agencies. NGOs can provide a useful linking
function between the public and the government.
In general, the public is interested in the benefits of new or improved roads. They
may feel that the builders (ie., the government and the contractors) should take
care of the negative impacts.

10.0  Recommended Environmental Protection Procedures and Action Program
150.        This chapter summarizes the recommendations for procedural changes and
improvements within DOH that are discussed in the various chapters of this SEA. Also
presented here is an Environmental Action Program which will assist in achieving these desired
changes.
10.1  Recommended DOH Environmental Process
151.        NEQA requires that an environmental impact assessment (EIA) study must be
carried out for all special highways projects and the national highways that go through the
protected and/or sensitive areas. The EIA must be reviewed and approved by the EIA
Reviewing entity within MOSTE. A 1992 Cabinet Resolution ordered that an Initial
Environmental Examination (IEE) is required for widening of the roads and highways that go
through protected and/or sensitive areas while an environmental checklist is required for
rehabilitation and maintenance activities. The IEE is reviewed and approved by OEPP while the
checklist can be reviewed and approved by the Forestry Department.
152.        To comply with the NEQA and Cabinet requirements and to increase its capacity
to deal with environmental problems, an environmental unit was created in DOH under the
planning division. Technical capacity of this unit as well as of DOH as a whole in dealing with
environmental problems is still very limited and needs to be strengthened as soon as possible.
153.        A new, small, independent, high-level Environmental Unit reporting to the
Director General should be established within DOH to ensure that the projects of the Seventh
Plan are carried out without major environmental degradation. In addition, a process should be
instituted within DOH which attends to environmental issues at every stage of project
development (planning, pre-construction, construction, and operation). The new DOH
Environmental Unit should have as a principal responsibility the administration and
implementation of this process.
154.        Durin- the Planning Phase, DOH must identify environmental issues, scope plans
for environmental study, conduct preliminary field surveys, consult with affected groups and
concerned agencies, and prepare TORs for needed environmental studies. As part of feasibility
studies, DOH should examine altematives, assess impacts and possible mitigation measures,
conduct economic analyses, conduct appropriate environmental studies (EIA, IEE, or checklist)
and obtain their approval as required by laws/regulations.
155.        During Pre-construction activities, DOH should allocate adequate budgets for
implementation and monitoring of the environmental mitigation measures. Detailed design and
bidding documents must incorporate the environmental improvements and mitigation measures
identified in the environmental analyses.
156.        DOH responsibilities during the construction phase include monitoring and
reporting to ensure compliance with the contract specification on environmental protection
aspect. The contractor's willful failure to carry out mitigation measures should be cause for
termination of the contract.
TtiAiLANr) - SECK)RAL ENVIR)NMENTAL ASSESMENT FOR HiGHWAYS               PAGE 82



157.        Later, during the operation and maintenance phase, DOH should carry out
monitoring and evaluation to ensure adequacy of environmental protection and cost effectiveness
of the activities.
158.        An outline of the recommended DOH Environmental Process is presented in
Figure 10.1, covering the major phases of the project cyde. These preliminary flow charts can
serve as first-level "decision-trees" to guide DOH. A part of the Environrnental Action Program
detailed in Section 10.3 (Action 4) should be the enhancement of this Enviromnental Process,
filling in needed operational detail and developing appropriate Manuals of Practice for carrying
out each step of the process. Figures 10.1 is designed to provide an overview and to include
indications of who should be primarily responsible for each action or decision step.
10.2 Recommendations Regarding Land Compensation and Resettlement Issues
159.        The DOH land acquisition process described in Section 4.3 appears to involve
compensation only for situations involving actual takings of land. In spite of this, there are cases
where impacts may not extend to the taking of land or houses. An indication of how DOH deals
with these situations is found in Case 3 in the box in Section 4.3. The DOH paid local farmers
for damages caused by erosion and runoff from highway construction, even though their lands
were not taken. Using this as a precedent, it is not unreasonable to recommend that the DOH
consider formnalizing the compensation procedures for all other situations, such as when access
to a portion of a property is disrupted or prevented. There are a series of institutional barriers
that must be resolved to allow conformance with World Bank's Operational Directives 4.30 and
4.20. [Word Bank 1990, World Bank 1991b]
160.        In the event that land or other..
property is taken and people are forced to   -IRSet3flPogam en  p:i:

the principles in the box at right.
161.        Action 6 in Table 10.1 below calls for further developing the DOH land-acquisition
and compensation procedures to include the principles outlined above. Useful guides for the
implementation of these goals are found in the World Bank's Operational Directives 4.30 and
4.20 [World Bank 1990, World Bank 1991b]. The latter document addresses relocation impacts
on indigenous peoples, which would also need to be compiied with for projects affecting
indigenous populations.

10.3  Environmental Action Program for the Fifth Highway Sector Project
162.        The World Bank's Fourth Highway Sector Project included Action Plans for
reducing pollution from mobile sources, enhancing safety, and for other purposes. This Action
Plan served to focus the sub-projects towards common goals, and is currently being carried out.
Following this example, recommendations are presented for actions that will facilitate the
enhancement of environmental procedures at DOH and other agencies of the RTG. The actions
specified in Table 10.1 are considered necessary to ensure that the DOH program of projects
under the Seventh Plan will not adversely arfect the environment.
163.        A possible impediment to the implementation of environmental mitigation
measures as a standard process in the development of the Seventh Plan is that little information
exists regarding the cost of these measures. Possibly as a result, DOH may not be allocating
adequate budgets for environmental work If line items for environmental mitigations do not
appear in program or project budget requests, it is possible that funding will not be made
available. A further complication is that there is not a large body of data on these costs, so it is
difficult to forecast these needs at the planning stage.
164.        An approach to estimating these costs is presented below. It is strongly
recommended that these numbers be refined by DOH using Thai-specific information as it
becomes available. Costs presented here are order-of-magnitude estimates only. Using the data
in Appendix H, the total cost of those projects which may require environmental documentation
and mitigation was extracted. These projects are the ones specified in Table 4.1 as impacting
Wildlife Preserves, National Parks, waterways, or towns. The total costs are then multiplied by
a percent of total construction cost which corresponds to environmental mititgation. The
percentages are based on estimates from projects in the United States, and as such may be on
the high side. The resulting approximate cost for environmental mitigation for Seventh Plan
highway projects (not including the Motorways) is presented below.

Qualitative and quantitative information regarding construction are required as follows:
3.3.1  transportation of soil
3.3.2  clearance of the sites (size, location including map, amount of excavated
soil, locations for storage of soil and other filling materials)
3.3.3  digging and excavation in each areas (length and height; location with
map; amount of out and fill; location of storage; location of borrowed soil;
locations of sources of soil, rock, and other materials) - should indicate
the large areas having more than 1,000 m3 in the 1:20,000 map of
alignment and show the above data in tables;
3.3A  filling and embanking (size, location, amount, type of soil) - should
indicate the large area having quantity more than 1,000 m3, height more
than 2m) in the map of alignment and show the data in tables.
3.3.5  underpipe and other structure related to drainage (study and design to
facilitate equilibrium of underpiping and natwal hydrology including
formula and calculation, location and site of the pipe).
3.3.6  engineering structure such as elevated road and bridges (projects on
special construction such as elevated road or bridges in case that
underpiping is not applicable, procedure and steps for construction of
elevated road with minimum inpacts including service roads during
construction).
4.    Guidelines for impact assessment:
- assess the impacts to the site and nearby area 500m away from the center of the rcad
or more if significant impacts may occur such as water resources downstream about 2-3
km due to sediment and in case of dividing the project into sections according to
geo/topography or kilometer poles:
-     assess the impacts during construction and operation;
-     compare the impacts for each issue in cases of with and without other
important development projects that may have impact on the road project
being studied;
-     assess the impacts of the road project to other existing and future
development projects in the area.
The environmental issues shall include, at a minimum, the following:
4.1    Changes in hydrology - should consider quality and quantity relating to natural
water flow, water level, drainage, seepage, etc. for both surface, underground,
and seepage in the project site and nearby area and study the impacts on
impeding of natural drainage, changes of water level in upstream and
downstream areas, changes of quality and quantity, velocity, direction, and

OEPP GUIDELINES FOR ROAD CONSTRUCrIoN AND WIDENING EIAs
This Appendix contains an outline for Environmental Impact Assessments for
construction and widening of roads into protected areas according to the Office of
Environmental Policy and Planning. ElAs in this category should contahi the following sections::
1     Introduction - r0ers to the cabinet resolution in March 1992 and the problems
:xperienced from the previous projects that go through the protected and sensitive areas
(Kao Yai-Prachinburi Highway and Doi Tong - the later one was first constructed by the
military for the King's mother project and was transferred to DOH at a later stage after
erosion problems occurred). The serious problems include impacts on forest, wildlife,
erosion, and hydrology resulting in serious damage of downstream and lowland uses
especially to farmers.
2.    General irnpacts -  direct impacts  include  forest and  wildlife  resources,
erosion/deposition, water quality, scenic and aesthetic quality; - indirect impacts include
illegal logging, disruption of natural ecology, weather and local climate, flooding,, socio-
economic, inappropriate development causing degradation of natural resources.
3.    Procedure and description of projects - In preparing an EIA, some flexibility can be
made as appropriate to the areas. The project proponent shall submit implementation
procedures of the project in detail and special consideration be given to the impacts due
to changes of ecosystems of forest and wildlife, surface hydrology of the areas, erosion
and sedimentation and shall prepare data/information including maps relating to the
following:
3.1   Project description
3.1.1  type and nature of project
3.1.2  rationale for the project
3.1.3  location
3.1.4  size/class of road standards and important of the project (length and
width, cross section and profile, right of ways, drainage, bridges, etc.
3.1.5  total cost of the project
3.1.6  construction plan including time and schedule of construction
3.1.7  existing status of the project
3.1.8  ful project and network of relevant transportation
32    Road aligmnent - briefly explains the alignment since there are some parts
encroaching into the protected areas (wildlife sanctuary, national park); prepares
map scale 1:20,000 - 1:50,000 as appropriate; and details the following: definite
location of the areas encroaching into the critical areas, length of the encroached
areas, reasons why this alignment can not be changed, and other alternatives (if
any).
3.3   Design and implementation of the project
In designing and implementing the project, design alternatives appropriate to the areas
such as..., mnangrove, coastal areas, and agricultural areas should be considered.
THAiLAND - SECIRAL ENVIRONMENTAL AssEaMENT FOR HIGHWAYS                    PAGE C-1



5.3   prevent and correct the impacts on erosion and sedimentation  - including
dredging, planting vegetation, construct drainage system, consider new
alignment;
5.4   reduction of impacts during construction - propose alternatives for construction
methods relating to construction of drainage or bridges, soil excavation and.
digging, borrowing pit, ernbanking, disposal, and selection of time for
construction including the distance to be constructed during each period; propose
alternatives for selection of service road during construction;
5.5   measures relating to other development projects in the area - propose plan to
manage any expecting conflicts and changes both at the present and in the future;
these measures should be integrated and formed an action plan including
estimation of budget and comparison of available options (including
recommendation for the best one).
6.    Monitoring plan - including:
6.1   forest, wildlife, and water birds
6.2   changes in hydrology, quantity and quality of surface water
6.3   erosion and sedimentation
6.4   socio-economic conditions
6.5   other important areas as identified in 5 and 6.
The plan shall identify parameter, frequency, report format, recipients, including the agencies
responsible for the budget.

ANNEX I/i: GUIDELINES ANNEX
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS FOR
PROJECTS INVOLVING MAJOR
CONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS
A. Introduction
1.   Most major construction projects of ell types involve certain impacts on en-
vironmental resoures that are signiricant and can be vely serious if not properly
managed during project plnning and implementation, and which tend to be over-
looked by many planners and engineers because it was not necesy to wony about
them in the pro-environmental protection eas. These constraints, which must be
evaluated for a*l projects at least at the lEE level, to determine whether any fol.
low-up EIA will be needed, are described below.
B. Environmental Constraints During Construction Phase
2.   Almost all major constuction projects impose quite significant temporary
hazards to environmental resources during the project's construetion phase.
Hence these hazards need to be accounted for and the proper protection measures
included in the project ES, and their cost included in the project's construction
budget. The FS/EIA should describe these hazards and how they wil be managed.
3.   The most common serious problem  posed by most major construction
projects (during the construction phase) are shown as fallow:



management of hazardous waste.
Target Area
-     Within port
(4) Water Ecology
-     Collect plankton and benthos every four months
Target Area
-     Port and Saithong Beach.
(5)   Transportation
-     Collect data on traffic with separate type of cars every four months.
-     Collect data on traffic accidents every four months.
Target Area
-     National Highway number 3.
(6)   Public Health
-     Collect data on causes of sickness of the people
Target Area
-     Health Office at Map Taperd and Houy Pong
(7)   Occupational Health/Safety
-     Collect statistics for sickness and accidents
-     Measure noise level Ld. every four months
Target Area
-     Within the port
-     In the office building, central building, port and project site.
2. During, Operation
(1)   Sea Water Ouality
-     Measure depth, transparency, T, S, pH, DO SS, BOD, oil/grease every
four months.
Target Area
-     in front of port, every point of wastewater discharge, Saket Island, open
sea and front of Saithong Beach.

* OEPP PROPOSAL FOR HIGHWAY TRAFFIc EIA
AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT



Projst Title                  Environmental Impact Assessment and Management of
Highway Traffic Project
Requesting Agency            Office of Environmental Policy and Planning (OEPP),
Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment
Proposed Source of Assistance    World Bank
1) Background Information and lustification for the Project
In Thailand for approximately the last ten years, motorization and highways have
been proceeding at a rapid pace. As a result, environmental problems by automobiles are
now beginning to become more apparent, especially in large cities such as Bangkok,
Chonburi, Chang Mai, etc. Levels of noise and air pollution are even more serious. In order
to resolve the problem of environment effectively, there is an urgent need to strengthen and
improve the technologies available in Thailand for measurement analysis and prediction. At
present, OEPP are taking (steps) to establish environmental monitoring division which
includes transport monitoring system, development of networks of trunk roads and
highways, (all of which) have close ties with World Bank programs. Considering an urgent
management for resolving the environmental traffic, The World Bank may be the most
suitable partner for cooperation effort with Thailand under Fourth highway project.
Obiectives
1)    To study the level of environmental impact which resulted from highway
traffic.
2)    To study possible improvement of predictive methodologies (mathematical
modelling) for air, noise and vibration pollution.
3)    To plan and provide mitigation measures for various highway traffics.
4)    Establishment of comprehensive monitoring methodologies to validate the
modelling for future application.
5)    To conduct the project as an on-the-job training program for OEPP and related
agencies' staff, especially in environmental impact analysis and methodology
of data handling, and measuring system as well as designing monitoring
program.
2) Results Expected Upon Completion by the Project
1)    Environmental Impact Analysis for large scale roadway planning.
2)    Environmental management guideline for large scale roadway planning.
3)    Hardware and software of modelling for future use on other proposed
highways.
4)    Enviror.mental monitoring system such as air quality, noise and vibration for
major road in urban (areas).
5)    Recommendation of mitigation measures for highway projects.
3) Recommended Sources of Information and Data Related to the Project
1)    The Department of Highways

FOREWORD
TtN.s publication contains an annotated flow chart of each major environmenlal subject area for which the Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA) has a responsibility. The specific concerns have evolved from focused laws, regulations, and executive-orders; such as the Clean
Air Act, the Endangered Species Act. 36 CFR SOD (Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties). Executive Order 11990-Wetlands, etc.
Comprehensive environmental concerns are derived from the language of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Section 109(h)
of Title 23. Flow charts for these issues and processes are not included.
This document provides an abbreviated desk reference, useful to both new and experienced employees. tI will Identify and track the myrlad
of environmental processes which may be applicable to highway project development. It will also be useful when project development
activities require coordination with other public and private agencies and entities.
The loose leaf format will facilitate changes and revisions as the various requirements change. The individual pages can be punched to fit
in a binder or can be joined together to produce a fold-out chart for a single subject. Users are free to modify the charts In any way they
feal Is useful and appropriate.
Additional copies of this publication can be obtalned from the National Technical Information Service, Springfeold, Virginla 22161.
