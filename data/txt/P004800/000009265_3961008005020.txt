MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND
FOR A FIFTH HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
1.           I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  memorandum  and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Kingdom of Thailand for the equivalent
of US$150.00 million to help finance a Fifth Highway Sector Project. The loan
would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 17
years, including four years of grace.
2.          Country/Sector Background.   Thailand's explosive growth in GDP,
averaging almost 10 percent per annum between 1988 and 1995, has led to vastly
increased demands for transport and has put severe strains on the existing
infrastructure and the environment, especially in Bangkok Metropolitan Region
(BMR). An extensive transport network has been developed which offers a wide
range of modal options at varying levels of service including road, rail,
inland waterways, ports and aviation.   Road transport, however, dominates the
sector accounting for 89 percent of the total freight traffic and 90 percent of
passenger traffic over 219,000 km of roads covering the country.   The State
Railway of Thailand (SRT) has a network of about 3,861 route-km radiating from
Bangkok. Rail freight, representing two percent of national freight tonne-km,
is highly concentrated in a few commodities with cement and petroleum
accounting for three quarters.  Similarly for passengers, rail's share is only
9 percent.   Inland waterways actually account for a larger share of freight
than rail.
3.          Traffic  growth  has  been  most  dramatic  in  road  transport.
Nationally, road traffic increased at the rate of almost 15 percent per annum
since 1989 while the size of the vehicle fleet, excluding motorcycles, more
than doubled, growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent per annum between 1985
and 1993. Motorcycles multiplied even faster at an average rate of 14 percent
per annum, making up 65 percent of the nation's vehicle fleet and creating a
disproportionate amount of the noise and air pollution. With GDP growth
projected at an annual rate of 7.5 percent in the medium term, and the fleet
of nearly 10.8 million vehicles expected to continue growing at these rates,
there is an urgent need to increase road capacity and improve the efficiency
of the use of road infrastructure to avoid serious bottlenecks to Thailand's
continued economic growth. Already, Thailand has about 4,500 km of inter-urban
two-lane roads carrying over 8,000 vehicles per day -- traffic levels which
generally indicate four-laning to maintain minimum acceptable speeds. The
challenge will be to service this demand while mitigating the environmental
impacts of such dynamic growth in the road sub-sector.
4.          Under the Department  of Highways'  (DOH's)  Seventh Highway Plan
covering the period 1992 to 1996, road capacity would be increased through
widening 2,094 km of main arteries connecting Bangkok with the regions to a
four-lane standard at an estimated cost of Baht 45 billion.   The revised Plan
also includes a widening of an additional 1,115 km of roads not located on the
main arterial routes at a cost of Baht 36 billion, and improvement of
interchanges (in 38 locations) of existing roads and the construction of
controlled-access motorways (198 km) . This is appropriate since the surface
condition and strength of the trunk network have been brought to a very



satisfactory level in the last several years, while congestion on the main
roads in the Central Region (i.e., the Bangkok area) clearly indicates that
network capacity is not keeping pace with traffic requirements.   Maintenance
expenses are also programmed for higher allocations under the Seventh Plan than
under the Sixth.   Together with the significant rehabilitation and upgrading
efforts proposed, these increases are considered highly satisfactory.
5.          The road sub-sector  in Thailand is highly developed and well-
managed and the DOH, in particular, is a mature and relatively efficient
institution with good technical capabilities which continues to improve and
enhance its systems and human resources.   Whereas maintenance and sustaining
the road network in good condition is the central issue facing most of the
Bank's client countries, Thailand faces a different set of issues which relate
more to the fact that growth is outstripping capacity.   Meeting this demand
while mitigating environmental impacts related to road construction and
increased vehicular use represent the key issues addressed under the Fourth
Highway Sector Project and are further supported under the proposed Project.
Successful management of the issues depends on the institutional capacities of
the DOH, the Land Transport Department (LTD), the Office of Environmental
Policy and Planning (OEPP) and the Department of Pollution Control (DPC),
particularly with regard to implementation of efforts to mitigate environmental
problems such as controlling vehicle emissions and noise pollution and reducing
traffic accidents; and also in developing a greater range of resource
mobilization   options,   including  private   sector   finance,   to   fund  an
appropriately-balanced, multi-modal transport network.
6.          The major impact of rapid motorization has been the substantial
increase in transport-related pollution.  Among the air pollutants in the BMR,
transport accounts for the bulk of lead and more than a fifth of suspended
particulate matter  (SPM)  emissions.   Two stroke motorcycles are the worst
offenders for SPM and hydrocarbons  (HC) emissions.   They contribute about 87
percent of the SPM emissions, a fifth of the lead emissions, and almost half of
the hydrocarbons emissions from transport sources in the BMR.   Diesel-powered
vehicles, mainly trucks and buses, contribute about a seventh of the transport
SPM emissions.   During the past three years under the Fourth Highway Sector
Project Action Plans, important progress has been achieved in beginning the
complex process of establishing a sustainable framework of policies, standards
and  actions  for  reducing  vehicle  emissions  in  Thailand.    Perhaps  most
impressive has been the progress in reducing the lead content of gasoline. With
refinery modifications largely complete, all regular-grade (88-93 RON) gasoline
sold in Thailand from December 1995 will be entirely lead free, while the
previously-introduced unleaded premium-grade (94+ RON) fuel continues to gain
market share, and the relatively "dirty" economy-grade (83 RON) has been
eliminated. Substantial reduction in the sulfur content of diesel fuels has
also  been  achieved,  and a  further  reduction  is mandated  for  1995.    All
lubricating oils sold in Thailand are now required to meet international
standards for "smokeless oil". BMTA is piloting a fleet of 82 buses fueled by
Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), and options for wider use of alternate fuels have
been identified in a study financed under the Fourth Highway Sector Project. A
study of motorcycle emissions control options has been prepared by consultants
and discussed with key government agencies and the motorcycle manufacturers in
Thailand,  as well as their Japanese parent companies.    (ASTEN will shortly



- 3 -
issue a modified version of this report as an Asia Region Discussion Paper.) A
similar review of diesel engine emissions control options is now under
preparation, to support further discussions of revisions of the rhai emissions
regulations.
7.          The most significant components of the proposed Action Plans to be
implemented during the 1996 to 1999 period are: Ci) continued reduction in
Thailand's supply of leaded regular gasoline  from essentially 100% of all
gasoline sold there in 1991 to a total planned elimination of lead by the end
of  1995;  (ii)  the development  and licensing  of privately  operated  pilot
vehicle inspection stations in BMR; (iii) establishment of an aggressive on-
road and government-owned fleet emissions testing program 'o identify and
force the repair of the worst polluting vehicles; (iv) submission of a series
of revised emissions standards for new and in-use vehicles, as well as revised
ambient air quality standards with a special focus on motorcycle emissions;
and (v) continuation of efforts to complete the Vehicles Emissions Laboratory
and Demonstration Inspection Center (DIC) to support quality control and
training requirements for the vehicle inspection program.
8.          Another important consequence of the rapid motorization has been
the rise of traffic accidents at an annual rate of about 15 percent since the
early 1980s, combined with a level of traffic related deaths of about 12 per
10,000 vehicles. In 1992, 10,200 fatalities were reported by the police.
However, these figures are thought to be on the low side as accident records
are often neither accurate nor complete.  Various factors are responsible for
the high accident rate, including inappropriate design of some road segments,
poor vehicle condition stemming from inadequate ma ntenance and unsafe driver
behavior.   Measures to address road safety have included the introduction of
third-party liability insurance for all vehicle operators and stricter highway
safety laws such as the mandatory use of helmets for motorcyclists which have
begun to yield positive benefits. Among the necessary enforcement measures to
be supported under the proposed Project is improved safety inspection of
vehicles, linked to pollution control inspection efforts.
9.          Besides the environmental and safety concerns, the increasing need
for more highway capacity, particularly for an extended inter-urban motorway
system, has raised interest in finding additional resources, preferably from
road users.  Fuel prices are in line with prices in neighboring countries and
are higher than the opportunity cost of refined products.   The government,
realizing that it could no longer fully finance the needed highway capacity
expansion solely from its own budgetary resources decided to carry out a "Long-
Term Strategic Investment Study" financed under tbe Fourth Highway Sector
Project. The objectives of the study were to carry out a highway investment
master plan for the next twenty years and review alternative financing
mechanisms available to Government, including pricing and taxation options, and
the tapping of capital markets and relying more on the private sector to
finance a share of future highway expansion. One objective of the study was to
develop options which will raise revenues while ensuring more appropriate user
pricing to support or improve allocative efficiency and environmental goals.
The Long-Term Strategic Investment Study was completed in May, 1995. The
Government is currently reviewing the study recommendations for discussion with



- 4 -
the Bank and with the objective of developing and implementing a time bound
action plan based on the findings of the study.
10.         Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement. To date, the Bank
has provided a total of about US$777 million for 13 highway projects in
Thailand. Implementation of these projects has been largely satisfactory,
mostly within budgets and on schedule. The last four projects as well as the
proposed project have been based on the sector design approach, which has
introduced flexibility to sub-project management and created positive benefits
that have built on existing infrastructure and past programs and strategies.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) prepared for the First and Second Highway
Sector Projects (dated June 30, 1994) found that the two projects helped DOH
sustain a more efficient road transport system by focusing on maintenance,
strengthening institutional capacity to accommodate traffic increases much
greater than originally expected, and applying resources to enhance DOH's
fiscal capabilities. The lessons learned from the implementation of the two
projects pointed to the fact that the maintenance policy adopted by DOH and
the conservatively designed pavements had facilitated economic growth in spite
of the higher than anticipated traffic volumes. The Implementation Completion
Report (ICR) for the Third Highway Sector Project indicated that the project's
development objectives were satisfactorily achieved, and that the design of
the Fourth Highway Sector Project incorporated the lessons learned.
Implementation of the Fourth Highway Sector Project is proceeding well.
11.         With regard to the elements of the previous projects for which DOH
was not directly responsible, i.e., the environmental, safety and industry
efficiency Action Plans, anticipated difficulties in coordination and in
procurement have been experienced.   While commitment to the Action Plans has
been excellent and progress in policy reforms has been substantial, problems
have arisen from the need to coordinate various agencies and ministries as
well  as  from  changing  institutional  responsibilities  in  Thailand.    The
establishment of the coordinating consultant together with Bank supervision
under the Fourth Highway Sector Project has provided a good basis for further
progress under the proposed project.
12.         Rationale for Bank Involvement.    The rapid growth of the Thai
economy during the last decade raises two sets of issues that need to be
addressed in order to sustain development. First, the quality and adequacy of
physical  infrastructure,   particularly  of  transportation  facilities,   are
emerging as key constraints to medium-term growth. Infrastructure bottlenecks
are already serious in BMR, and now extend to many secondary towns. Secondly,
the environmental impacts of rapid growth, particularly due to the increase in
demand for transport and energy, are raising concerns about the quality of
future growth. As a recent Bank economic report (Report No. 11770) found, the
social costs of traffic congestion and transport-related air pollutants are
already high and would continue to rise without concerted actions.
13.         The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Thailand,  which was
discussed by the Board on September 22, 1994, considers the provision of
adequate physical infrastructure and mitigation of the environmental impacts
of transport growth among the priorities for Bank lending and policy advice.
Hence, the proposed Project, a logical extension of the efforts initiated



under the Third and Fourth Highway Sector Projects, is fully consistent with
the CAS. It sets the stage for developing a longer-term transport strategy as
the opportunities for widening existing roads are reduced and as public sector
resources fall short of financing requirements -- raising the need to attract
private funds.   Moreover,  it continues to build on government efforts to
address the environmental and safety implications of road traffic growth.
While a more direct treatment of these latter issues, particularly in BMR,
through a specific urban transport project or urban environmental project may
be called for, the institutional make-up of Thailand has made it difficult to
develop such operations.   The Highway Sector Project series,  however,  has
served as an effective instrument to address many of these issues with
significant implications for BMR since many of the related sectoral policy
responsibilities lie within the purview of the Ministry of Transport and
Communication.
14.         Project Objectives.   With the general objective of meeting the
continued rapid growth in transport demand resulting from sustained economic
growth, and to address critical issues associated with transport-related
environmental pollution and safety,  the project aims specifically at:   (i)
furthering the implementation of actions aimed at reducing environmental
degradation and vehicular accidents attributable to fast growing motorization
through the establishment of a privately operated vehicle inspection system;
(ii) improving the quality of service of the inter-urban road network through
increased road capacity and improved safety standards of existing roads, and
(iii)   providing a systematic basis for the establishment of environmental
assessment criteria at the design stage as well as environmental management
during and after new road construction and capacity improvement sub-projects.
15.         Project Description.   The project is an extension of the ongoing
Fourth Highway Sector Project and as such would continue to assist MOTC, LTD,
DPC and DOH by providing financing: (i) to support the Government's Seventh and
subsequent Highway Plans and some carry-over from the Sixth Plan, which aim to
increase network capacity through a program of widening the country's major
inter-urban  road  links  to  four-lane  standard;  (ii)  to  provide  technical
assistance,  training  and monitoring  in  the  implementation  of  the  vehicle
inspection system under the emissions reductions and road safety improvement
Action Plans involving DOH, LTD, MOTC as well as other related agencies; and
(iii) an EA strengthening program for DOH and OEPP.   Civil works financing
would be provided in a sector loan format.  Financing of DOH's widening program
is also being provided by the Asia Development Bank (ADB) and Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund of Japan (OECF).
16.         Project Financing.  A Bank loan of US$150.00 million would include
about US$140 million to help finance a four-year slice of the DOH program of
works  for 1996-99  tentatively estimated at some US$6 billion.    DOH would
present its annual work programs for Bank review within the framework of the
overall road expenditure program, and submit part thereof for Bank financing.
Project items in support of government's Action Plans totaling about US$14
million would be implemented by line agencies under the overall coordination of
MOTC. The Action Plan components would be mostly financed out of Government's
budget with the Bank contributing US$2.19 million and ADB providomg support
amounting to US$2 million under its Second Regional Roads Project to finance



- 6 -
various components. Bank funds would be disbursed on the basis of contracts for
specific civil works and consultancy services.
17.         Estimated project costs total US$325.52 million, of which US$150.00
million (or 46% of total project costs) would be financed by the proposed loan.
Disbursements,   especially  for  capacity  increases,   are  designed  to  be
concentrated among a limited number of large contracts, minimizing the required
number of contracts to be directly monitored under the loan. A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Scheduile A.  Amounts and methods of
procurement  and disbursement,  and the disburserent  schedule,  are  shown  in
Schedule B.   A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Thailand are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
A map is also attached.   The Staff Appraisal Report,  No.  13333-TH,  dated
November 28, 1995, is being distributed separately.
18.         Project Implementation.  The project would be car<ried out by MOTC,
DOH, LTD, DPC and other agencies responsible for Action Plans components, and
the Office  of  the National  Environment  Board  (NEB).    MOTC would oversee
implementation of the Action Plans activities, assisted by the Action Plans
Coordinating Unit (APCU) established Tinder the Fourth Highway Sector Project
and further assisted under the proposed Project. Civil works sub-projects would
be selected on the basis of procedures and criteria, including a minimum
economic return of 12%, which were agreed with the Government under previous
highway sector projects.
19.         Project   Sustainability.       The   civil   works   components   are
sustainable. DOH is now a mature organization whose practices and procedures
meet acceptable standards; road maintenance and its funding are adequate.
Moreover, as the project would further strengthen program management,
particularly strengthening the Environmental Assessment (EA) process management
capacities,  sustainability will continue to improve.   With the assistance of
the APCU within the MOTC, Bank involvement will continue to focus on addressing
environment and road safety matters in order to help the government effectively
deal with complex policy issues.
20.         Actions Agreed.  Agreement was reached with the± Government on: (a)
its annual review with the Bank of the scope and implementation of the Action
Plans and of the Seventh and subsequent Highway Plans; (b) annual consultation
with the Bank on sub-projects and Action Plans activities to be carried out
during the coming fiscal year; (c) the development of a time bound Action Plan
for the implementation of the recommendations of the Long-Term Strategic
Investment Study; (d) the evaluation methodology for sub-project selection and
environmental assessment, including resettlement; and (e) a mid-term review of
overall project status, but with emphasis on Action Plans progress and DOH
Environmental Strengthening Component.
21.         Environmental Aspects. The review and improvement of EA procedures
undertaken by DOH and the Bank during the implementation of the Fourth Highway
Sector Loan, combined with the government's passage of a major new
environmental law in 1992, the National Environmental Quality Act (NEQA), have
served as the bases for a Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SEA) for highways
in Thailand. This report was one of the first prepared under the new Bank SEA



- 7 -
guidelines of October, 1993. The SEA was endorsed by DOH in April, 1994, and a
summary of the document has been circulated separately to the Board prior to
the departure of the appraisal mission.   These improvements in DOH project-
level assessment procedures and adjustments needed to bring DOH processes into
conformance with the NEQA, would provide the underpinnings of the proposed EA
strengthening component of the project.
22.          Project  support  to the ongoing Action Plans  to Reduce Vehicle
Emissions and Noise Pollution would have a positive effect on the environment.
Thailand's rapidly increasing motorization has been accompanied by serious
health hazards posed by high levels of vehicular emissions and noise in urban
areas. The dangerous effects of respirable particulate n,atter, high lead levels
and high carbon monoxide levels are now of growing concern to the population at
large. The Government has recognized and begun to alleviate this situation
through the introduction of lead-free gasoline and improved smokeless
lubricants as well as the mandating of tougher noise and emissions standards
for new vehicles. Action Plans components to be carried out under the project
would further address these issues through the further strengthening of fuel
standards, the development of more stringent emissions standards, vehicle
inspection and roadside testing targeted to reduce vehicular pollution in the
country's metropolitan areas, particularly Bangkok.
23.         DOH has confirmed that previously agreed procedures for (EA) would
be applied for all new sub-projects under the Seventh and subsequent Highway
Plans. These procedures, which are generally consistent with the Bank's EA
requirements, call for the screening of all projects for their environmental
impacts at the feasibility study stage and incorporation of any needed
mitigation measures  in the project  design.  DOll has provided EA  screening
summaries for all ongoing projects for which Bank financing is committed or
proposed under the project. These projects mainly involve rehabilitation and
widening of roads on existing alignments and within existing rights-of-way.
Bank financing of additional sub-projects would be contingent upon a
satisfactory EA screening by the newly-created DOH Environmental Unit. Although
not anticipated under this project, DOH has agreed that full EA reports,
following guideline terms of reference previously agreed with the Bank, would
be carried out for all projects encailing new rights-of-way or expected to have
a significant environmental impact.
24.          Project Benefits.  The project will have a positive impact on road
infrastructure  development  and  use,   and  help  forestall   infrastructure
bottlenecks which could constrain future economic growth.   Over time,  lower
road transport costs will also contribute to a better integration of the Thai
economy.   The reductions  in vehicular air and noise pollution as well as
improved road safety will also yield substantial benefits to the general
public.   The minimum economic return for sub-projects to be included in DOH's
program will be 12 percent.
25.         Risks.  A main risk is that the momentum for implementation of the
Action Plans may slow down as the choices are narrowed to the more difficult
issues.  To date, Government has responded very positively and has established
an APCU in MOTC, the responsibilities of which go far beyond the requirements
under the Fourth Highway Sector Project. In addition, the project includes



- 8 -
funding for technical assistance, studies and analyses that should provide
strong justification in support of the more difficult Action Plans issues.
26.         Recommendaticn.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
