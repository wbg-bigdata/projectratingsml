CUCUTA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Staff Appraisal Report
I. LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                Empresas Municipales de Cucuta (EMC)
Guarantor:               Republic of Colombia
Amount:                  US$18.5 million equivalent,  including capitalized
front-end fee of US$46,135 and interest during con-
struction on the loan until the date for the first
principal payment.
Terms:                   17 years, including 4 years grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
Project Description:    The proposed project would consist of (a) construc-
tion of water transmission, storage and distribu-
tion facilities, and development of a new source of
water supply for Cucuta; (b) expansion of sewerage
system, and construction of a waste water treatment
facility to reduce river pollution; (c) storm
drainage improvements; and (d) provision to EMC of
extensive technical assistance for a program of
institutional improvement.
Risks:                   Since the works are relatively simple and consult-
ants would he assisting EMC, no significant delays
are expected in the execution of the project.
While EMC should not find it difficult to generate
funds required for the project, its readiness, or
ability, to raise water rates does present a risk.

11. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Service Levels
2.01        In 1983, about two-thirds of Colombia's estimated population of
27.5 million lived In urban agglomerations6/ and one-third in the small com-
munities or rural areas.  About 60% of total population had access to public
water supply and about 50% was connected to a sewerage system. Piped water
was available to 80% and sewerage services to 65% of the urban inhabitants.
These proportions were much lower for the rural population; about 22% had
water connections and less than 20% sewerage connections.
2.02      Nationwide water and sewerage service levels place Colombia among
the better served countries in Latin America; several countries with similar
income levels rank far below.  However, the quality of service is uneven.
Many water supply and sewerage systems are in need of repairs or have become
obsolete. In large and medium-size cities, safe water is generally available
on a continuous basis, but service tends to be irregular in some neighbor-
hoods. In small communities and rural areas, the quality of water is often
unsatisfactory.   In practically all urban and rural areas, waste water is
discharged untreated, often causing severe pollution in rivers and streams.
Sector Institutions
2.03       The Ministry of Health is in charge of the sector and formulates
sector pclicy in coordination with the National Planning Department.   TwO
decentralized entities, the National Institute for Urban Development (Insti-
tuto Nacional de Fomento Municipal, INSFOPAL) and the National Institute of
Health (Instituto Nacional de Salud, INAS) are responsible for central
planning and financing of sector investment in urban and rural areas, res-
pectively, and act as technical and financial intermediaries. In 28 princi-
oal cities, where about 48% of the country's population is concentrated,
autonomous municipal utility companies (Empresas Publicas Municipales) are in
charge of water supply and sewerage, and - in many instances - of other muni-
cipal services such as power, telephones, solid waste collection and dispo-
sal, public markets and slaughterhouses.  As a rule, these companies have a
General Manager, appointed by the Mayor, and a Board whose members are
appointed by the City Council and civic organizations.   In most smaller
cities and towns, sanitation works companies (Empresas de Obras Sanitarias)
are in charge of construction, maintenaice and operation of water supply and
sewerage systems.   The activities of these sanitation works companies are
coordinated and supervised by municipal or departmental authorities, and by
INSFOPAL; in fact, some of them were operating subsidiaries of INSFOPAL
before 1975, when INSFOPAL was reorganized and relinquished the operation of
sanitation facilities. Sanitation works companies are managed by executives
selected jointly by INSFOPAL and the local authorities, and their Boards
6/ 2,500 or more inhabitants.

consist of representatives of INSFOPAL, the departments and municipalities,
and civic organizations. In many small towns, local administrations provide
water and sewerage services directly.  In rural areas, water and sanitation
facilities are built by departmental offices of INAS In coordination with the
beneficiary communities.
2.04       While the water supply and sewerage sector in Colombia might have
reached a higher stage of development than in most other Latin American coun-
tries, the record of INSFOPAL, INAS and most of the companies supplying the
services has fallen short of expectations.   Performance of these operating
entities Is largely determined by local conditions and the attitudes of the
local authorities. Thus, INSFOPAL and INAS found it difficult to provide the
leadership required to ensure within the sector adequate standards of opera-
tion, maintenance and financial management.   Moreover, they never acquired
the necessary proficiency in investment programming and supervision of pro-
ject execution by local operating entities. Frequent changes in management,
shortage of competent and experienced staff, and deficient administrative and
operational procedures have further limited the effectiveness of the two
institutions.   At the local  level, most of the operating companies are
handicapped by poor and often unstable management, unduly large and poorly
trained work forces, deficient maintenance and operation practices, high
levels of unaccounted-for water, reluctance - or inability - to charge proper
water rates and inadequate accounting, billing and collection procedures.
Sector Policies and Finances
2.05        Government policy aims at expanding water and sewerage services,
and improving their quality.  For 1990, it has set for urban areas service
level targets of 90% for water and 80% for sewerage. For rural areas, ser-
vice levels are to be raised from about 22% to 40% for water supply and from
less than 20% to 35% for sewerage.  This would mean reaching an additional
5.5 million people in the urban areas and an additional 2.0 million in the
rural areas by the end of 1990.   In line with the Government's goal of
"development with equity", most of the new beneficiaries would be low-income
families, consuming relatively little water and paying minimum rates.
2.06      The Government recognizes that these service level targets are very
ambitious.   In the 1970s, annual sector investment averaged about US$160
million equivalent at 1983 prices.   The peak of almost USS200 million was
reached in the middle of the decade, but thereafter investment fell to about
US$120 million annually.   About 92% of the investment benefitted urban and
only 8% rural areas. About 60% of the capital expenditures was financed by
budget appropriations and domestic credit; about 20% by external lenders,
primarily the Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank; and the balance
largely from internal cash generation of the local operating companies.



-5 -
2.07       The Government is well aware of the financial implications of its
policy aims for the sector, which would call for capital expenditure of the
order of US$1.7 billion (at 1983 prices) over the next six years.   Conse-
quently, attainment of higher levels of self-financing through internal cash
generation by the local companies providing water and sewerage services has
been affirmed as an objective of Government policy for the sector.   The
Government also endeavors to ensure more than in the past a steady flow of
funds for sector investment, recognizing that its sporadic contributions in
the past have hampered planning for expansion and delayed execution of
projects. The Government is also well aware of the problems with the central
sector institutions INSFOPAL and INAS. A major assessment of their functions
and performance is underway and may lead to a reform of these institutions.
As a first measure, the Government In September 1983 changed INSFOPAL's man-
agement with the expectation of strengthening INSFOPAL's leadership and
supervisory role in sector affairs and of accelerating the implementation of
ongoing projects.
Bank Role in the Sector
2.08      Between 1968 and 1979, the Bank made nine loans, totalling US$233.4
million, for water supply and sewerage in Colombia.  In addition, water and
sewerage components were included in the first urban project and the nutri-
tion project of 1978, and in two rural development projects financed by the
Bank. Six of the loans, US$166.3 million in the aggregate, were made to the
autonomous municipal utility companies in Bogota, Cali and Palmir:;, and
three, for a total of US$67.1 million, to INSFOPAL for relending to local
companies  in support of  36 projects in medium-size and small cities and
towns. By far the largest borrower has been Empresa de Acueducto y Alcanta-
rillado de Bogota (EAAB), to which the Bank has lent US$132 million in three
separate operations; a fourth loan is being discussed. To date, performance
audit reports were issued for the first Bogota project of 1968 and the first
Call project of 1970, and a project completion report for the Palmira project
of 1971.7/ These reports were critical of the optimistic projections of
demand for water, which have been disproved by a declining trend in urban
growth in the 1970s and by a concomitant fall in water use per household, as
low-income Inhabitants came to represent a rising proportion of the benefi-
ciary population.  They pointed to delays in project execution which, in an
inflationary environment, resulted in cost overruns for most of the
projects.   Furthermore,  the reports emphasized the generalized failure to
raise water rates sufficiently to allow the compliance with financial per-
formance targets.
7/ SecM78-260 of March 3, 1978, SecM79-632 of August 29, 1979 and SecM83-714
of July 11, 1983.



2.09       The Bank's experience wiLh the Bogota projecLs and with EAMB has
been relatively good.  The first LWo projecLs, though completed after sub-
stantial delays, have achieved their basic objectives. The third projecL is
being carried OUL saLisfacLorily and should be compleLed by mid-1985. In the
case of the other projecLs and borrowers, the Bank has encountered difficul-
Lies in accomplishliLg ItS instituLioaal objectives. In particular, INSFOPAL
in spite of Lhree loans has uor developed into Lhe sLrong and efficient regu-
latory, technical support and financial assistance lnstitution through which
the Bank planned LO supporL projecLs la medium-size ciLies and towns.  The
financial performance of many municipal utilities (Call, subborrowers of
INSFOPAL projects) was laadequate, largely because of the combined effect of
insufficienL tariff levels and excessive operaLiag costs. The financial via-
biliLy of many companies was Impaired particularly in 1981 and 1982 when the
Government rejected applications for water rate adjustments.   Only in 1983
did the Government move to correct the Bstuation by authorizing large rate
increases; however, Lhese increases were reduced or delayed in some instaaces
because of political opposILion. AnoLher obstacle for more efficient project
implemenLation was Lhe Government's inability to make available budget appro-
priations for invesLment Lhrough INSFOPAL and INAS In a timely fashion.
2.10      Faced with Lhe failure of INSFOPAL, the Bank has changed Its sector
strategy for Colombia. Multi-city lending is no longer considered feasible
until INSFOPAL can improve Its performance dramatically, or alternative
lntermedlary arrangements satisfactory to the Bank are established.  Consi-
deration is being given at this time to direct lending on a selective basis
to the larger municipal uLility companies, which have demonstrated the will
to Improve their standards of performance and to accept outside advice, even
though this Is regarded as an inferior solution likely to constrain efforts
to raise service levels throughout Colombia. Empresas Municipales de Cucuta
would be the first of these companies.
III. THE PROJECT
Project Origin
3.01       The projecL was ldenLified by a Bank misslon which visited Cucuta
in November 1981 aL the requesL of Empresas Muimcipales de Cucuta (EMC), the
proposed Borrower.   Following Lhis mission's recommendations, EMC engaged
local consultants LO update existing master plans for waLer and sewerage in
preparaLion of Lhe proposed project.  Between the laiLial visit In November
1981 and appraisal in December 1983, several Bank missions assisted in the
preparation of Lhe project.
The City
3.02      Cucuta, capiLal of the Department of Norte de Santander, is located
in Northeastern Colombia on the Colombian/Venezuelan border (IBRD Map
18145). WiLh a curreaL population of about 350,000 it is Colombia's elghth
largest  city.     Cucuta  gained  its  regional  lmportance  and  relative

years.   The finaucial LargeLs stlpulated iL  Lhe INSFOPAL-iMC agreements



- 9 -
were not fully met.   INSFOPAL's poor managemeut of the projects and the
Government's refusal to authorize requests for tariff increases in 1980,
1981 and 1982 are partly responsible for EMC's inability to complete the
projects in time and to meet financial targets.
Project Objectives
3.09       The proposed project has two prime objectives:  (a) to improve
and expand water, sewerage and storm drainage services in Cucuta; and (b)
to assist EMC in developing into a strong multi-service municipal company
which could serve as a model for similar companies in other medium-sized
Colombian cities.  Specific targets for service improvements include: for
water, the expansion of services through house connections to 95% of
Cucuta's population by 1988 and the construction of the Zulia River water
production and transmission scheme which, with complementary investments in
water transmission, storage and distribution, would provide an adequate
source of safe water for the next 20 years; for sewerage, the extension of
services to 80% of Cucuta's population by 1988; and for storm drainage,
improvement of drainage facilities in some downtown areas.  By providing
waste water treatment the project aims at improving water quality in the
Pamplonita River and at protecting water quality in the Zulia River, there-
by protecting Venezuela's Riparian Rights on the latter. The institutional
improvement effort would be designed to improve EMC's operational effi-
ciency, maintenance practices, tariff system and administrative and manage-
rial capabilities through technical assistance and training. A major goal
would be to improve EMC's financial performance through the introduction of
appropriate financial policies including the financial self-sufficiency of
each of EMC's services. The project would also assess the advantages of
the integration of municipal services in the emerging Cucuta Metropolitan
Area (para. 3.05) by financing a feasibility study on this subject. Parti-
cipation in the proposed project would be in line with the Bank's current
sector strategy for Colombia (para. 2.10).
Project Description
3.10      The proposed project would include (for more detailed description
see Annex 3):
(a)  Part A    Expansion of Water Transmission and Distribution
Capacity including the construction of water transmission
lines '(about 40 Km in length), two storage tanks (about
8,000 m3 capacity), a pumping station (about 120 1/sec capa-
city), secondary distribution networks (about 120 Km in
length), aad service connections (about 10,000)8/, purchase
and installation of water meters (about 50,000), leak detec-
tion and repair, and improved pressure zoning;
8/ The construction of a total of about 20,000 water and about 16,400 sew-
erage connections Is projected before the end of 1991.   The project
would include 10,000 water and 8,200 sewerage connections to complement
project investments in secondary networks included in the project; the
remaining connectioas would be made by EMC in areas with existing net-
works or provided by developers and would not be financed under the
project.



- 10 -
(b)  Part B    Construction of Zulia River Water Production and
Transmission Scheme with a capacity of 1 m'/sec including
the construction of two pumping stations, a water treatment
plant, transmission mains (about 20 Km in length), and three
storage tanks (about 7,000 m3 capacity);
(c)  Part C   Sewerage including the construction of collectors
(about 11 Km in length), a waste water stabilization lagoon
(about 1 m3/sec capacity), secondary sewerage networks
(about 100 Km in length), and service connections (about
8,200)8/, and the execution of erosion control measures;
(d)  Part D   Storm Drainage including the construction of storm
drainage collectors (about 5 Km in length) and the lining of
lower portion of Canal Bogota (about 1.3 Km in length);
(e)  Part E   Institutional Improvement through technical assist-
ance, training and purchase of equipment to upgrade EMC's
maintenance and operation capabilities (including leak
detection and repair) and managerial, administrative and
financial systems (organization, accounting, budgeting, per-
sonnel, planning, tariffs and charges); and
(f)   Part F   Consulting Services for project administration and
supervision of construction, the preparation of a study on
the feasibility of integrating mumicipal services in the
Cucuta -Metropolitan Area' and final engineering of waste
stabilization lagoons.
Consultants have demonstrated that the water supply and sewerage works to
be executed under the project are part of long-term expansion strategies
representing least-cost solutions at a discount rate of 11%.
Status of Project Preparation
3.11      Project preparation is well advanced. Engineering consultants to
EMC have completed about 90% of final designs and bidding documents for the
works included in the project. With the exception of the designs for the
waste water stabilization lagoons, for which consultants are currently
carrying out treatability tests on a pilot facility, all designs and
bidding documents are expected to be completed by the end of July 1984.
Draft terms of reference for the project administration and supervision of
construction consultancy have been discussed during negotiations. After
incorporating the Bank's comments, EMC expects to invite proposals from
four local engineering firms with qualifications satisfactory to the Bank
by mid-June 1984 and have the consultants on board by September 1984.
Draft terms of reference for the various technical assistance consultancies
are being prepared by EKC and are expected to lead to the beginning of work
in March 1985 in accordance with the timetable presented in Annex 4.

Project Execution
3.12       EMC's limited capacity to contribute to the cost of the project
from its internal generation during the initial years of project execution
makes it unlikely that the project can be completed by the end of 1987, as
EMC is urged to do by the President's Representative and municipal and
departmental authorities. A 7.5-year implementation period (mid-1984-1991)
with the bulk of investment carried out during the first five years would
be more in line with the Bank's experience in the Latin America and Carib-
bean Region. The contracting and implementation schedule for the project
is shown in Annex 3.   Highest priority components within the proposed
investment program would be the expansion of water transmission, storage
and distribution facilities, the institutional improvement program and the
construction of several sewer collectors. A first bid for the purchase of
transmission pipes is already being analyzed.  Since first payments on this
contract may come due before the signing of the Loan, retroactive financing
up to a total of US$0.5 million for goods and services procured after
December 31, 1983 and in accordance with Bank guidelines is recommended.
For the Zulia River water production and transmission scheme to come on
line in 1989, procurement has to be initiated in 1985.
3.13      EMC would carry out the project through its Project Coordination
Office assisted by consulting engineers for project administration and
supervision of construction. This arrangement would strengthen EMC's capa-
ciLty to carry out the project satisfactorily.   EMC agreed during nego-
tiations that it would maintain a competently staffed Project Coordination
Office throughout the period of project implementation. The signature of
the contract between EMC and qualified consultants for project administra-
tion and supervision of construction would be a condition of effective-
ness.  Final agreement on the scope and the timetable for the implementa-
tion of the institutional improvement program and other consultancies
(Annex 4) was reached during negotiations. Assurances were obtained from
EMC during negotiations that consultants to carry out these assignments
would be hired under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank and that
EMC would give the Bank the opportunity to comment on their recommenda-
tions.
3.14       The areas where sewerage networks would be built have not yet
been determined definitely.   EMC has agreed to furnish to the Bank for
review by no later than March 31, 1985 a program for their construction
establishing priorities based on population density, and willingness and
ability of the potential beneficiaries to pay.  EMC also agreed to con-
struct waste water stabilization lagoons in order to improve water quality
in the Pamplonita River and to preveat the impairment of water quality in
the Zulia River.   Consultants satisfactory to the Bank have already been
engaged by EMC to prepare the final engineering for the lagoons.   The
consultants are expected to complete their work by the end of 1984. EMC
agreed during negotiations to purchase the land required for the lagoons by
no later than December 31, 1986.  No major problems are foreseen in the



- 12 -
purchase of the land, since uuder Colombian law Cucuta's Municipal Council
would have the right to expropriate the laad under a "common good"
provisiou. In most poor neighborhoods water coaLections would be provided
ahead of sewerage connections. Continuing its present practice, EMC would
take appropriate temporary measures for the sanitary disposal of sullage
water until sewerage is provided.
Project Cost
3.15       The cost of the project, excluding interest during construction
and the front end fee on the Loan, is estimated at US$32.8 million equiva-
lent  (para.  4.01).   The base cost,  in June  1984 prices,  is  US$25.4
million. No allowance is included for duties and taxes for imported goods
since EMC is exempt from such charges. Local goods are subject to a tax on
the value added by local manufacturers which on average amounts to about 4Z
of the purchase price. This tax is included in the local cost component.
Physical Contingencies add US$2.6 million (about 10% of base cost) and
price contingencies another US$4.75 million (about 17% of base cost plus
physical contingencies). Price contingencies were calculated assuming that
local inflation varies from 20Z in 1984 to 18% in 1991, foreign inflation
from 9.5% in 1984 to 6% in 1991 9/ and exchaage rates from Col$96.8/US$ in
1984 to Col$233.6/US$ in 1991.  Interest during construction is estimated
at US$5.05 million and the front-end fee to US$0.05 million. Total financ-
iag required thus amounts to US$37.9 million. The foreign exchange cost of
the project including project investment, interest during construction on
the Bank loan up to the date of the first repayment of principal and the
capitalized front-end fee would amount to about US$18.5 million (48.8% of
total financing required). Consulting services are estimated to cost about
US$1.8 million for a total of about 600 man-months including professional
and non-professional personnel (Annex 4). With the exception of about 12
man-months, all consulting services are expected to be provided by local
personnel.
Financing Plan
3.16         The Bank Loan would finance the projec.'s foreiga exchange
requiremeats of US$18.5 million. Local funds would come from the following
sources: EMC's internal cash generation (US$8.3 million, 21.9% of total);
long-term loans from local financial institutions in the amount of Col$600
million, or US$4.2 million equivalent (11.1% of total); and a Government
contribution of Col$800 million, or US$6.9 million equivaleat (18.2% of
total).   The Government's budgetary contribution would be made available
during the 1984-1986 period. Assurances by the Government to provide these
funds in a timely fashion were obtained during negotiations.   The local

loau would be ueeded iu 1986 and 1987. Most likely it would be provided by
Fondo Fiaanciero de Desarrollo Ilrbano (FFDU) which has already, through a
letLer  of  inLent,  expressed  iLS  preparedness  to  make  Lhese  fuads
available.   During negotLatious assuraaces were obLained thaL EMC would
make arrangemeLts to obtain the loan by no laLer Lhan December 31, 1985.
The GovernmenL has given assur.saces that iL would Lake the actions
necessary Lo euable EMC Lo obLain Lhe loan.
ProcuremenL
3.17      WiLh few excepLions equipiuent coaLracLs are expected Lo be won by
foreign manufacturers.   Contracts  for water pipes and accessories mosL
likely would be awarded to local manufacturers, although large diameLer
pipe may be supplied by foreign manufacturers.  Qualifyiag domesLic manu-
facLurers would receive a preferenc.e in bid evaluation of 15% of Lhe CIF
price, or Lhe prevailiag import duLy, whichever is less. Civil works con-
Lracts are expecLed to be won by local contractors, buL because of Cucuta's
locaLion, participatiou of foreign l:Oatractors Is posslble. ConLracts for
Lechnical assistance and consulLants' services are expecLed to be awarded
to local firms which for specialized areas would rely on foreign
cousultanLs.
3.18       In order Lo atLracL compeL.ILiOa from abroad conLracts would be
grouped inLo large packages for boLtl suJpply of goods and civil works.  Au
excepLioa would be Lhe construction .)f v-iater and sewerage networks and ser-
vice connections which are more convenliently  bid in smaller packages.
Works by force account are noL fore-seena. A deLailed contracting schedule
is presenLed in Annex 3, ALtachment. 2.   The thresholds established for
InLernational CompeLitive Bidding (ICB) aud Local Competitive Biddiag (LCB)
(para. 4.04) would easure that conLr;acLs awarded through ICB would accouat
for more than 80% of projecL cost.  The limits for prior review of bidding
documentaLiou by the Bank (US$100,000 for goods contracts and US$500,000
for civil works contraCLS) would re3ult iLL a coverage of abouL 90% of Lhe
total estimated value of goods conLra:ts ar.;d abouL 80% of civil works con-
tracLs. All cousulting contracts wou: d be procured in accordance with Bank
Guidelines.  To avoid delays in the g; antintg of import licences which have
arisen li Lhe pasL, the GovernmenL provided assurances during negotiaLiOnS
LhaL import licences for BaLnk fiLnanced good's under Lhe projecL would be
granLed promptly by ILstLituto de Comercio ExLterior (INCO1EX).
Disbursemeut
3.19       Disbursemeut of Lhe Bank Loan (Annelx 6) would be against:  (a)
100% of foreign expendiLures for direct import:;; 60% of local expendiLures
for imporLed equipmenL aud maLerials procured locally aud 60% of Lhe ex-
factory COSL of locally manufactured goods; (b.' 30% of total expendiLures
for civil works; (c) 100% of foreign expenditur es for foreign cousultants
and  training and  30% of local expenditures f7or local consultanLS and
training; and (d) amounLs due for inLeresL and o Lher charges on Lhe Bauk's
loan  until  Lhe  date  of  the  first  principal  repaymenL  to  the  Bauk.



- 14 -
For local contracts, whose value is less than US$30,000 equivalent, dis-
bursement would be against Statements of  Expenditure certified by EMC.
Documentation for these expenditures would not be submitted to the Bank,
but retained in EMC's Project Coordinatic.n Office for periodic review by
the Bank.   All other disbursements would be fully documented.   The dis-
bursement schedule for the project is shown in Annex 7 and is consistent
with the past experience in water supply projects in Latin America (para.
3.12). The Loan's closing date would be June 30, 1992.
3.20       In order to reduce the interval during which EMC would finance
with its own resources the Bank's share of goods and services, a Special
Account would be opened at Banco de la ftepublica and an initial deposit of
US$1.0 million would be made into it through one or more withdrawals from
the Loan Account.   EMC would claim d-isbursement of the Bank's share of
expenditures from the Special Account.  Upon the presentation of withdrawal
applications, the Baak would replenish the Special Account. The Bank would
require a monthly statement of the Special Account which would reflect the
transactions during the previous month..
Financial Performance
3.21      Between 1978 and 1982, EMC generated revenues sufficient to cover
operating costs, working capital needs and debt service for all its ser-
vices on a consolidated basis, but its financial performance fell short of
the targets established under Loan 1072-CO (Annex 8).  Water and sewerage,
traditionally, has been EMC's strongest revenue earner, and revenues from
this service have been used to taubs-1.dize deficits in other services.
Between 1978 and 1982, expenses fc,r WELter supply and sewerage quadrupled
under the impact of Inflation and ser%rice expansion, while the growth of
operating revenues fell behind because of very low tariff levels which did
not change throughout 1980 - 198.2.  :-n this situation, investments were
small and financed mainly by loa-as and Government grants. Thanks to sub-
stantial tariff increases for weter arid sewerage (90% in April 1983 fol-
lowed by monthly 1.5% increases through December 1983) and slaughterhouse
services (sevenfold in October 1982), EMC's overall financial performance
improved substantially in 1983 ilespite a depressed demand for slaughtering
services and stagnant market reIrenues as a result of the devaluation of the
Venezuelan currency. Only the solid waste service incurred a cash deficit
of an estimated CoIS30 million which was covered by the cash surplus
generated by other services.
3.22      EMC's average (Decemnber 1983) combined water and sewerage tariff
is CoIS11.6/m3 (USSO.14/m3).   The sewerage tariff Is 50% of the water tar-
iff.   EMC's customers are dL,v,ded into several categories (5 residential
according to socio-economic * apacity, commercial, industrial), and the tar-
iffs are progressive (Annex 8, Attachment 4). The lowest residential cate-
gory benefits from a fixed c.harge of only ColS46 (USS0.03/m3) for a monthly
minimum consumption of 20 mrJ. In line with other cities in Colombia, high-
income customers pay rates about five times higher than those collected
from low-income families.   On balance, water and sewerage rates, even after
the recent i.creases, rema i:n low in comparison with other Colombian cities
with a comparable socio-economic level. Likewise, solid waste tariffs are
low.   Consequently, raisi.ng  tariffs in real terms over a period of time
would  not  inflict  undu e  hardship  on  EMC's  customers  (para.  3.29).



- 15 -
EMC derives abouL 20% of its waLer and sewerage operating reveaues from
connection charges which for a combined water/sewerage connecLion are abouL
ColS28,000 (US$350). The present sysLem of charges is distorLed, since the
sewerage conneCtiOn charge is only abouL 10% of the combined charge.
Depending on a cusLomer's ability to pay, concection charges can be paid in
up to 40 monLhly installments.   Uader the Lechnical assistance program
(Anaex 4), consulLauts would assist EMC in reviewing aud upgradiag its sys-
tem for tariffs and charges.
3.23      Some of EMC's existiag debt is secured by liens oa asseLs of the
slaughterhouse, solid wasLe and markets services. According Lo the docu-
mentation supplied by EMC at negotiaLions, these liens are quite small and
not ou asseLs critical to the execution of the projecL aad Lo EMC's ability
to perform satisfactorily aud Lo service the proposed Bank loan. The Bauk
has, Lherefore, accepted exisLing liens wiLhouL requiring parn passu treat-
ment.
Financial CondiLions and Future Performance
3.24       During the period of the execution of Lhe proposed project, EMC
would adopt and implemenL financial policies and measures aimed at rehabil-
itating its financial performance and aL raisiag iLs capaciLy for internal
generation. As a first step, EMC has already raised tariffs for its water
and sewerage (1.5% monthly) and market (25%) services.   Adequate tariff
increases for Lhe solid waste service are expected to be approved by Lhe
National Tariff Board and implemented by EMC before the end of  1984.
Beginning in 1985, EMC would mainLain the full financial self-sufficiency
of all services oLher than water supply and sewerage by raising tariffs and
charges sufficiently LO cover operating costs, and working capital needs
aud debt service or revalued depreciation, whichever is higher.   For its
waLer acd sewerage service, EMC would maintain tariffs and charges suffi-
cient to meeL Lhe annual rates of return on fixed assets revalued annually

from about 1.0% ia 1984, to 3.5% ia 1985, 5% in 1986, 5.5% in 1987 and
1988, 6% in 1989 and 7% in 1990 aud sLaying aL LhaL level thereafter. EMC
also would noL incur any debL which would reduce the debt service coverage
below 1.5 during any 12-month period. In addiLion, EMC would not undertake
any investmenL program wiLh aggregaLe expendiLures in excess of US$1
million annually without the prior concurrence of Lhe Bank. By September
30 of each year, EMC would present to the Bauk a finaacial plan for the
next Lhree fiscal years which would include inter alia, for each service,
financial projections based on proposed tariff actious and CoSL control
measures.  Tariff adjustmeats would be introduced gradually by means of
monthly aud quarLerly increases to reach desired levels.  EMC would also
reduce the level of sales in accounLs receivable, including arrears for all
services, from a presenLt 3.0 months to 2.5 months of billing by the end of
1985.    Assurances  on  these  points  were  obLained  from  EMC  during
negotiations.
3.25      While adequate tariffs for all of its services would be Lhe key
Lo EMC's financial rehabiliLation, technical assisLance provided uader the
proposed projecL would assume an importanL role ic raising productiviLy and
bringing about cosL-savings throughouL EMC.   Among the specific targets
agreed to by EMC (Anaex 10) would be a reduction in Lhe number of employees
per Lhousand water conceCLions (from a preseut 7.5 to 6.0 in 1989) and con-
trol of unaccoun-ed-for water (from a present 36% Lo 26% in 1988).

3.26        The above measures would briag about a gradual lmprovemeat of
EMC's finaucial condilious. DurJug 1985 and 1986 Lariff lcreases would be
about 7% ia real Lerms aud the rate of returu of EMC's waLer and sewerage
operaLioL would rise LO 5% ia 1986.  The relaLively slow raLe of lacrease
of EHC's Lariffs during 1984-1986 Lakes iLto coaslderaLlon CucuLa's ecoao-
mic situatLio  which Is expected LO sLill be recoveriug during Lhese years
from Lhe effecLs of Lhe devaluaLioU of Lhe Veuezuelan currency iu 1983.
Nevertheless, wiLh the avallabIlILy of Lhe GoverameLaL conLribuLion and Lhe
local loan EMC's cash generaLionL (about 10% of projecL il 1985 aad abouL
20% in 1986) would be sufficlenL Lo meeL local flaucing requiremeaLs. As
Cucuta's economy Improves, annUal Lariff increases of about 12% in real
terms would be lmplemented each year duriug 1987-1990.   This would bring
the raLe of reLurn ou EMC's waLer aad sewerage service to abouL 7% by
1990.  Beyoud 1990 Lariffs would be adjusLed in lile wILh laflatLon.   In
real terms, Lhe average waLer and sewerage Lariff would increase by about
65% betweeu 1984 and 1990.   EMC's aggregaLe conLribuLIon to the projecL
from its lnLernal generaLloa would be a saLisfacLory 22% of the total pro-
Ject cost.
Beneficiaries
3.27        DirecL benefiLts of Lhe water supply componeat of the project
would accrue Lo abouL 240,000 people by 1991.  Beneficiaries would include
abouL 130,000 people who would receive water services and abouL 110,000
whose service would be upgraded. By 1991, abouL 100,000 more people would
be served wiLh sewerage Lhan aL presenL. The Zulia River scheme would pro-
vide waLer producLion capaciLy for an addiLlonal 200,000 people between
1991 aud 2008. The LreaLmenL of waste water would Improve waLer and eavi-
ronmeaLal qualiLy ic Lhe PamplonlLa River and prevent the deLerioration of
water qualiLy in the Zulia River and thus benefiL an uakaown aumber of
people who live adjacenlt Lo these rivers. AbouL 60% of the project benefi-
ciaries would be urbac poor, i.e., people below the relative poverLy level
(income less Lhaa US$220 p.a./persou, or Col$130,000 p.a. per family).
RaLes of ReLurn and Average Long Run IncremeaLal CosL
3.28       Using revenues from Lariffs required Lo meeL Lhe coveuanced raLe
of reLurn (para. 3.24) as a proxy for ecoaomic benefiLs, ecocomic raLes of
return were calculated for Lhe water supply (74% of LoLal projecL COSL) and
sewerage (18% of total projecL cost) components and for water supply aad
sewerage combiced (92% of LoLal projecL COSL).  The calculatlons detailed
iv Annex 9 used shadow prices.  No rates of retura were estimated for Lhe
instiSuLioual improvemen; aad storm drainage compouent because Lhelr cosLs
cannoL be reliably assigned to a_y specific group of beneficlaries.  The
cosL of these Lwo componeaLs ls small, equalliag ouly 8% of total project
COSt.  The resulting rates of return are 10% for waLer supply,  19% for
sewerage and 12% for boLh components combined. They are saLisfacLory con-
sideriag LhaL finaccial reveLues do nOL reflect fully the ecouomic and
social/healLh benefiLs of water supply and sewerage inves;meats.



- 17 -
3.29       At aa 11% discounL rate the average long-rua incremental cost of
water is Col$20.0|m3 and thaL for sewerage Col$6.4/m3.   Projected 1990
Lariff levels expressed in June 1984 prices would be Col$16/m-3 for water
and Col$8/m3 for sewerage (50% of water tariff) aud would be about 80% of
marglal COSL for water and 125% of marginal cost for sewerage. Consider-
ing that under EMC's progressive Lariff structure high- and medium-income
consumers would pay more than the marginal cost for both water and sewerage
for consumption levels In excess of 20m3/month, the magaitude of future
Lariffs is acceptable.
AffordabiliLy of Services to the Urban Poor
3.30        At present Lariff levels, the monthly charge to a poor family
consuming water up to the minimum consumption rate of 20m3/month is a low
Col$46 (US$0.03/m3) representing only 0.5% of a family's income at the
estlimated relative poverLy income level of about Col$130,000 per family and
year.  Sewerage and water supply Lariffs combined amount to about 0.7% of
family income. Assuming thaL family income increases in tune with infla-
tion, 0.8% of Lhe family income would have to be spent for water and 1.1Z
for water and sewerage combined for projected 1990 tariff levels. Thus the
cost of service is easily affordable for Lhe urbaa poor. The urban poor
would have to pay connection fees of about Col$18,000 for water and
Col$12,000 for sewerage. EMC would coatinue iLs policy of allowing poor
families Lo pay these fees in up to 40 monthly installments. The burden on
the budgeL of a poor family would be monthly payments of Col$450 (4.2% of
family income) for a water supply and Col$300 (2.8% of family income) for a
sewerage connection. These moathly payments would not be beyoad the poor
population's capacity to pay.
Project Sensitivity and Risks
3.31       The effect of variations in costs, beaefits and implementation
dalays for water supply and sewerage has been aaalyzed (Annex 9). The ana-
lysis demonsLrates that the economic rate of return is only moderately sen-
sitive tO chaLnges in cost and reveaues.  Even if revenues were overesti-
mated by 20% and actual costs were 20% hlgher than projected, the resulting
rate of retura would still be above 6% whlch Is acceptable for water and
sewerage projecLs considering that nelther health benefits nor the consumer
surplus are iacluded In the calculations.
3.32       The Bank's experience shows that the maln risks associated with
water supply and sewerage projects in Colombia are institutional and finan-
cial. In partlicular, the aLtitude of central and local authorities regard-
ing the implementation of timely tariff increases of sufficienL magnitude
presents a risk. However, EMC's past record ln this respect, although not
fully satisfactory, has beea better Lhan that of most. Colombian utilities
of comparable size.   Several projecL feaLures tend to reduce the risk of
failure in institutional aud finaacial areas. By strengtheniag EMC's man-
agemenL sySLems acd improving the quality and efficiency of its services,
the projecL would eahauce the utiliLy's acceptance in the community and its
ability Lo defend tariff increases.   In addition, revenue estimates are
conservative coasidering that populaLion aad COnSumption forecasts are
modest and that projected 1990 tariff levels would still be low in compari-
son to those charged in other Colombian cities and well within the



- 18 -
population's capacity to pay.  There would be therefore the poteatial for
increasing tariff levels beyoad the projected rates to compensate for unex-
pected cost increases. The risk of low-income households not belag able to
connect is reduced by EMC's policy of providing credit for connection
charges.
3.33       The risk of major project delays Is low in view of the fact that
all works are simple and that the services of qualified consultants for
project administration and supervision of constructlion are expected to
safeguard against major delays in project start-up and project execution.
In addition, the project has been given highest priority by local, depart-
mental and central  authorities.   The presence of the President's Repre-
sentative (para. 3.02) is expected to be very helpful in accelerating pro-
ject implementation.

Implementation Specifics
4.02       The project implementation schedule depicted in Annex 3, Attach-
ment 1s outlines the sequence of activities during the construction period.
The schedule has been developed based on expanding service to Cucuta's
population and improving EMC's institutional capabilities and financial
performance at the fastest pace possible and takes into account the avail-
ability of local funds.  The expansion of EMC's transmission, storage and
distribution system (Part A of the Project) would have highest priority
since it would enable EMC to make full use of the 1.4 m3/sec water produc-
tion capacity avallable at the El Portico Treatment Plant (para. 3.03).
The technical assistance program (Part E of the Project) to improve EMC's
-Institutional capabilities is likewise a high priority project component
and would get under way in early 1985. The scope of the technical assist-
ance program and a timetable for its implementation are detailed in Annex
4. Construction of sewerage collectors (Part C of the Project) and storm
drains (Part D of the Project) is planned to begin by mid-1985. Bidding
for the Zulia River scheme (Part B of the Project) would begin in late
1985; construction is scheduled to begin in 1986 and would take about three
years.  The waste water treatment facilities (Part C of the Project) are
the last project component to be constructed. The construction of second-
ary water and sewerage networks and service connections would extend
throughout the project Implementation period.
Procurement

4.04      The division of contractlng by type of procurement shown in Table
4.3 would assure that contracts accounting for more than 80% of total pro-
jecL cost would be open to foreiga bidders.   Small civil works contracts
procured on the basis of price quotations (llcitacion privada) would be for
the coastruction of sewerage and water networks and service coanections.

Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting
4.05        Indicators to monitor progress in operatioaal, management and
financial areas are presented in Annex 10.  During negotiations EMC con-
firmed that the proposed monitoring indicators reflect the expected pro-
gress In project execution and lmprovement of EIC's performance. EMC would
submit to the Bank semi-annual reports (due February 28 and August 31 for
preceding semesters ending December 31 and June 30, respectively) on the
progress of project implementation including details on the implementation
of technical assistance and on its operating aad financial performance.
These reports would measure progress against monitoring indicators (Annex
10), the contracting schedule (Annex 3), the project implementation
schedule (Annex 3), and the disbursement schedule (Annex 7). A completion
report would be prepared by EMC and submitted to the Bank no later than six
months after the closing date of the Bank Loan.



- 21 -
Accounting and Auditing
4.06        EMC would at all times keep adequate project accounts.  EMC's
flnancial statements, separate for each service and consolidated, and the
Special Account (para. 3.20) and the certified statements of expenditures
(para. 3.19) would be audited annually by independent auditors satisfactory
to the Bank. The auditor's report would be sent to the Bank no later than
five months after the close of each Fiscal Year (December 31).
Environmental Protection
4.07       The treatment of waste water (para. 3.14) would result in the
rec-yery of water quality in the Pamplonita River and prevent the deterio-
ration of water quality in the Zulia River, which would take place in the
absence of sewage treatment in Cucuta. The upgrading of water quality in
the rivers downstream of Cucuta would benefit people living next to the
rivers and depending on them for water supply. It would also ensure that
Venezuela's riparian rights on the Zulia River would not be adversely
affected.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01        During negotiations assurances were obtained from EMC that it
would:
(a)  take tariff and other measures as required to:
(i)  earn  for its water and sewerage operation rates of
return on revalued fixed assets of not less than 1.5%
in 1984, 3.5% in 1985, 5.0% in 1986, 5.5% in 1987 and
1988, 6.0% in 1989, and 7% in 1990, and thereafter
(para. 3.24, Annex 8, Attachment 1); and
(ii) produce for each of its services other than water sup-
ply and sewerage revenues sufficient to cover operating
costs, working capital needs, and tebt service or

3.24);
(b)  present to the Bank before September 30 in each fiscal year
a financial plan for the next three fiscal years with a pro-
posal for tariff and other measures required to meet the

(para. 3.13).
5.02         In addition, EMC coafirmed thaL it would adjust annually its
level of revalued fixed assets according to the method of valuatioa
reviewed durLng aegotLatLons (para. 3.24).
5.03       During aegoLiaLioas the Goverament has provided assurances Lhat:

COLOMBIA
CUCUTA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Project Area, Existing Service Levels, Demand and Plans for Expansion
Location
1.        The municipality of Cucuta is locaLed in Northeastern Colombia on
Colombia's border wiLh Venezuela.  It is the capiLal of the department of
Norte de Santander. The city occupies a wide valley on the eastern flank
of the Andean Mountains and is located at abouL 350 m above sea level. Its
climate is tropical with annual average temperatures of about 28C. Aver-
age annual rainfall is 600 mm.
Population
2.          Cucuta grew from a small town of some 40,000 in 1940 to its
current population of about 350,000.1/   It is the 8th largest city in
Colombia. Population growth since 1940 averaged some 5% p.a. From peak
growth rates of about 6% occurred ln the 1950s and early 1960s growth rates
declined gradually to an estimated 3.8% in 1982. Annual population growth
i.n Cucuta is projected to decrease gradually from 3.8% p.a. in 1982 to 3.2%
p.a. in 1990 and 2.5Z p.a. in 2000. The impact of the devaluaLion of the
Veaezuelan currency in February 1983 on the local economy is expected to
cause a short-term decline in Cucuta's population growth below the long-
terms trend.   In 1983 and 1984 population growth of 2.1% p.a. and 3.0%
p.a. is projected.   With these assumptions, Cucuta's population is pro-
jected to reach about 360,000 in 1985 and 430,000 in 1990 (Attachment 1).
Metropolitan Area
3.        During the last three decades, three municipalities located adja-
cent to Cucuta (Villa Rosario, Los Patios and Zulia) have experienced
exceptional population growth at abouL 4.6% p.a.   The current combined
population of these three municipalities is about 100,000.  Their popula-
tion are expected to keep growing ia the future aL rates higher than those
projected for Cucuta. There have beea discussions among departmental and
local auchorities on the possibility of integrating public services
throughout this Metropolitan Area. However, major administrative, legal,
political, financial acd technical issues must be overcome before a
-Metropolitan" solution could be implemented.  The proposed project would
include consulting services aimed at identifying these issues and to estab-
lish plan towards integrating public services if indeed such a solution
turns out to be a promising means for improved institutional and opera-
tional efficiency.
1/  Population data are based on the results of a recently completed Inte-
grated Urban Development Study for Cucuta which presents an in-depth study
on past population and populatioc growth projections for Cucuta and neigh-
boring communities.

Existing Water Supply Service Level
4.        AL the end of 1983, EMC serviced some 46,000 water connectiocs.
About 93% of these were classified as residential and 5.5% as commercial.
The rest (1.5%) were official and industrial connections.   These connec-
Lions are estimated to serve about 280,000 people, close to 80% of Cucuta's
total population. The population aot connected to the system belong to the
urbaa poor and live in neighborhoods located on the fringes of the city.
Water to the unconnected population is provided through tank car operators
who purchase water from EHC and sell iL under the supervisioa of EMC.
Insufficient transmissioa capacity forces EMC to ration the provision of
water to its customers. IL is estimated that about 40% of EMC's customers
are inconvenienced by intermiLtent service.   Most of the population has
adjusted to the temporary lack of service by installing in-house water
storage devices.  An analysis of metered consumption patteras indicates
that the monthly average consumption/connection is about 36 O3. This rate
corresponds to a per capita daily consumption rate of about 190 liters
which is in liae with rates found ia comparable Colombian cities. Current
consumption is probably somewhat depressed because of water rationing. The
quality of water provided is adequate.
Existing Water Supply Facilities
5.         EMC draws water from the Pamplonita River at an intake located
about 20 km upstream of Cucuta from where it is transported by gravity to
the El Portico Treatment Plant located on the southern edge of Cucuta. The
plant has a peak design capacity of 1.4 m3/sec. It was recently expanded
by 0.45 m3/sec with funds from the 'Zonas Marginales Program to which the
Bank contributes under Loan 1558-CO. To distribute this water to Cucuta's
population, EMC relies on three storage tanks (combined volume of 25,000
m3), five pumping stations and a transmission and distribution network of
about 440 Km in length.  The main features of Cucuta's water system are
shown in IBRD Map 18145.
6.        Insufficient water transmission and distribution capacity allows
EMC to efficiently distribute no more than about 80% of its water produc-
tion capacity. The high rate of unaccounted-for water is attributable to
two primary causes:  leaks in some of the city's older pipe networks and
low level of metering (only about 65% of connections have functioning
meters).   In addition, the existing divisloa of the network in pressure
zones is inefficient and responsible for abaormally high or low pressures
at service conanectios.
Water Demand
7.        Attachment 1 presents demand projections through 1992. The basic
premises and assumptions used to project the demand are:



_ 25 -
ANNEX I
Page 3
a) following EMC's objectives, water service through house con-
nections is to increase to 95% of Cucuta's population by 1988
and to be maintained aL this level thereafter.   This would
require Lhe addition of about 95,000 people (about. 16,000 con-
nections) to the system beLween 1985 acd 1988 and another
35,000 people (6,000 connections) between 1989-1991;
b) the average carsumption per conneCtion is constant throughout
the projection period.   Factors  contributing to increased
water consumption (disappearance of waLer rationing, increase
in standard of living) would be offset by those contributing
Lo decreasing water use (higher tariffs, increased metering,
connection of progressively poorer people);
c) unaccounted-for water decreases gradually from 36% in 1983 to
26% in 1988 as EMC carries out a waLer loss control program;
and
d) installed peak treatment capacity should be able to meet the
maximum daily flow assumed to be 1.2 of average demand.
8.          The water demand projections show that the average production
capacity of about 44 million m3/year available at the El Portico Plant
would be sufficient through about 1993.  The daily peak productioa of the
plant (about 1.4 m3/sec) however, would suffice only until 1988.   Addi-
tional peak production capacity would have to come on line if ENC is to
maintain its service targets.
Plans for Water System Expansio&
9.          Consultants to EMC have prepared a masterplan and feasibility
study which have idontified the Zulia River as the least-cost alternative
for meeting Cucuta's long-term water demand. The appraisal mission agrees
with this conclusion.  A first stage (1 m3/sec) of this scheme would be
executed under the proposed project and provide water to cover Cucuta's
demand through 2008. The highest priority item of the masterplan, however,
is the expansion of Cucuta's traasmission, storage and pumping facilities
so that the production of the El Portico Plant can be fully utilized. This
sLage of the project would also include a more efficient delineation of
pressure zoces aad a program to combat unaccounted-for water.
10.       The consulLants recommend that Cucuta's long-term water demand be
supplied from the Zulia River since the dependable yield of the Pamplonita
River (10-year, 7-day low flow is 1.8 m3/sec and decreasing because of
watershed degradation) is too small to produce more water from the El Por-
tico system. The Zulia River scheme involves tapping of the cooling waLer
tailings from the Termotasajero Power Plant, and construction of a water
treatment plant and a combined gravity-pumping water transport system to
the proposed Las Lomas and Atalaya storage tanks from where it would be fed
into Cucuta's transmission system (IBRD Map 18145).

ANNEX 1
Page 4
11.         EMC has removed all legal obstacles which might preveut the
development of the Zulia River scheme as planned.   Instituto Nacional de
los Recursos Naturales Renovables y del Ambiente (INDERENA) has given EMC,
per Resolution No. 2852 dated December 15, 1980 the right to draw up to 3
m3/sec from the Zulia River for the next 50 years. A coutract between EMC
and Instituto Colombiano de Electricidad (ICEL) dated June 17, 1983 assures
EMC an uninterrupted supply of 2 m3/sec from the tailings of ICEL's Termo-
tasajero Power Plant.
12.         Between 1985 and 1991, an estimated additional 130,000 people
would have to be served (para. 5).  EMC estimates that it would have to
provide secondary distribution networks and service connectious for only
about 60,000 people (45% of the total) under the project.   This would
require the construction of about 120 Km of secoudary distribution pipes
and about 10,000 service connections.   Almost all of these networks and
connections would be constructed in the poor neighborhoods located at the
periphery of the city.   Of the remaining 55% of counections, about 40%
would be made in areas with existing networks and about 15% are expected to
be added in urban developments where networks and connections would be pro-
vided by the developer.
Sewerage Service Levels aud Targets
13.         The current service level for sewerage is estimated at about
70%.   About 42,000 counections serve a total of approximately 250,000
people. The population without access to a sewer counection lives in the
poor neighborhoods on the periphery of the city. Exereta disposal in these
areas is through latrines.   Sullage water is disposed off on land or
through road side drainage channels.   Since most of the people without
sewer connections also do not have a water connection, disposal of sullage
is not a problem in most areas. EMC plans to expand sewerage services to
80% of Cucuta's population by 1988 and to maintain this level thereafter.
This would require the counection of about 100,000 additional people to the
sewerage system between 1985 and 1991.
Existing Sewerage Facilities
14.          Sewage in Cucuta is collected by 4 major interceptors:   two
interceptors running parallel to both sides of the Bogota Storm draiuage
canal serve as the main arteries for sewage collection; the Atalaya inter-
ceptor connects the western central part of Cucuta to the Canal Bogota
interceptors; and the Pamplonita River interceptor which parallels the left
bank of the Pamplonita River (IBRD Map 18146). About 30% of Cucuta's has a
combined sewage-storm drainage system. The remaining system is separate,
but sewer lines receive slgnificant quantities of storm runoff from storm
drainage connections to the sanitary system (roofs, patios). Deposition of
sediments from the bare hillsides in and around Cucuta is a serious problem
for the maintenance of sanitary sewers and storm draiuage lines.

ANNEX I
Page 5
Environmental Pollution
15.        At present, about 500 l/sec of raw sewage enter the Pamplonita
River aL a point downstream of Cucuta.   This discharge has deleterious
effects on the water quality in the Pamplonita River, but does not yet
affect noticeably waLer quality of Lhe Zulia River, lnto which the
Pamplonita River discharges about 56 km downstream of Cucuta.   Under
current sewage discharge levels, the Pamplonita River stretch between
Cucuta and the Pamplonita Rlver - Zulia River coafluence is devoid of dis-
solved oxygen (D.O.) at average and below average river flow conditions
(about 6.5 m3/sec). Thanks to higher flow rates in the Zulia River (aver-
age annual flow of about 70 m3/sec) and excellent background water quality,
water quality in the Zulia River remains acceptable even during periods of
low flow. As sewerage ervices in Cucuta would be expanded as a result of
the project (a sewage flow of about 700 1/sec is projected for 1991), water
quality in the Pamplonita River would deteriorate further if no treatment
of waste water was provided.  Simulatior with the Dissolved Oxygen model by
Streeter-Phelps indicate that without treatment of Cucuta's waste water,
water quality in the Zulia River stretch between the confluence with the
Pamplonita River and its discharge into the Catatumbo River would reach
unacceptable levels in the early 1990's during periods of below average
flow.   Waste water Lreatment provided under the project would restore
acceptable water quality in the Pamplonita River and safeguard water
quality in the Zulia River.
Plans for Sewerage System Expansions and Improvements
16.          Consultants to EMC have prepared a masterplan for expanding
Cucuta's sewerage system through the year 2005. After careful welghing of
SaniLation alternatives, the consultants recommend and the appraisal
mission agrees that conventional waterborne sewerage Is appropriate consi-
dering Lhat the impervlous soils in the project area do not allow disposal
methods relying on soil infiltration. In addition, it appears that most of
Cucuta's poorer population would be willing and also able to contribute Lo
the costs of providing sewerage services. The consultants determined that
the least-cost expansion strategy for Cucuta's sewer system would be to
divide the municipal area into three sewer districts (Pamplonita, Zulia,
Tachira) with separate interceptor and treatment facilities. Waste water
from the Pamplonita District, covering about 80% of the currently developed
portion of Cucuta, would be transported Lhrough the existing, but expanded
system of interceptors towards the northeastern corner of Cucuta where it
would be treated in waste water stabilization lagoons before discharge to
Lhe Pamplonita River (IBRD Map 18146).  Expanding collector capacity and
providing wasLe water treatment in the Pamplonita River District are Iden-
tified as hlghest priority ltems within Cucuta's sewerage masterplan and
would be carried OUL under the project. While development in the Tachira
District Is still in an incipient stage and does not yet justify the provi-
sion of inLerceptors amd treatmenL facilities, the Zulia District has seen



- 28 -
ANNEX 1
Page 6
considerable development, primarily by the poor segment of Cucuta's popula-
Lion. Here, pockets of deuse population have formed, which would receive
sewerage service under the project.   Initially sewage from these areas
would be discharged untreated into small local water courses. Interceptors
and treatment facilities would be provided during the second stage of
implementation of the sewerage masterplan.
17.       To decrease maintenance requirements on Cucuta's sanitary sewers
and storm drainage lines EMC has begun the implementation of an erosion
control program. The objective of this program is to slow down sheet ero-
sion by sLabilizing erosion prone areas through vegetation with indigenous
plants and to retard gully erosion through the construction of small reten-
Lion basins. This work is to be carried out primarily by the residents of
erosiou affected neighborhoods with EMC providing advise and materials.
18.         Between 1985 and 1991, an estimated additional 100,000 people
would have Lo be provided with sewerage services. This would require the
construcLion of about 16,400 new service connections. About 40% of these
new connections would be made in areas with an established sewerage infra-
strucLure.   Another 10% of fuLure connections and networks in currently
unsewered areas would be provided by urban developers. Consequently, EMC
would be responsible for providing trunk sewer capability and secondary
collector networks and service connections for the remaining 50% of the
people (about 50,000) to be serviced by 1991. This would require the con-
struction of about 100 Km of secondary collection pipes and about 8,200
service connections.
Storm Drainage
19.          Roughly 60% of Cucuta's developed area is served by a storm
drainage system. Much of this system overlaps with the sanitary system.
The backbone of the drainage system is the Canal Bogota, an open canal
which Lraverses the city in a South-NorLh direction and discharges into the
PamploniLa River. The lower 1.3 km of the Canal Bogota are unlined, caus-
ing maintenance problems and nuisance conditions in an area which is being
developed intensively. Consultants to EMC have performed a survey of storm
drainage conditions Lhroughout the central area of the city of Cucuta.
This survey documents the existence of several areas where flooding creates
damage to property, Lraffic obstacles and general nuisance conditions
several Limes a year.
Plans for Storm Drainage System Improvement
20.         EMC's main objective regarding storm drainage is to eliminate
chronic flooding problems in the cenLral part of the city.  Following the
consultanL's recommendations, high priority works are the lining of the
lower stretch of the Canal Bogota and the construction of several small
collectors which would solve the current flooding problems ia the central
part of Cucuta.

COLOMBIA
CUCUTA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Institutional Assessment of EMC
Legal Structure and Services Provided
1.          EMC is an autonomous municipal agency responsible for providing
water and sewerage, solid waste collection and disposal, slaughterhouse and
market  services  for  the Municipality  of Cucuta.    EMC's  institutional
capabilities are largely adequate for the present level of services in
Cucuta and to carry out the project, but substantial improvements will be
required for EMC to cope efficiently with the expected growth of its
operations.
Institutional Arrangement and Management
2.          Board of Directors and appointment of employees -   EMC is
governed by a 6 member Board of Directors including three members appointed
by the Municipal Council, two by Cucuta's Mayor, and the Mayor himself, who
chairs the Board and appoints the General Manager. The Mayor is empowered
to appoint all employees, but under current practice the General Manager
hires all ataff. Employment of management personnel and professionals is
subject to Board confirmation.
3.          Management  -  EMC  has  an  acceptable  record  of  management
stability, although General Managers have been replaced three times during
the last year.   Before that EMC experienced a 2-year period of strong
continuous leadership. EMC's middle management team, in spite of changes
in EMC's top management, has been kept essentially intact.    The present
General Manager, an Economist from the private sector, has strong community
support.
4.          Supervision - EMC is subJect to the supervision of the Munic-
ipal Controller, who is appointed by the Municipal Council. The Municipal
Controller primarily supervises the contracting of works and services and
budget compliance. The Municipal Controller is represented by a delegate
(auditor fiscal) working full time in EMC's offices.
5.          Organization - The current EMC organization (Attachment 1) is
suitable for present activities but expected to need adjustment in the
later years of project execution as EMC's services are being expanded.
Present major organlzational units, the heads of which report to the
General Manager, are: Water Supply and Sewerage; Finance; Ancillary Ser-
vices (solid waste, slaughterhouse and market); and the Project Coordina-
tion Office, which is responsible for overseeing the preparation and



- 31 -
ANNEX 2
Page 2
implementation of projects. A Planning Unit reports to the General Manager
and coordinates its activities with the Project Coordination Office. The
Project Coordination Office works in close coordination with a Representa-
tive of the President of Colombia appointed to oversee project execution on
account of a Government grant that would partly finance the Project. Reor-
ganization of EMC would be defined and implemented under the institutional
Improvement Program of the Project. Main issues to be addressed by manage-
ment consultants include:  permanency of the Project Coordination Office;
assignment of responsibility between the Planning and the Finance units for
long-range financial planning and preparation of budgets; creation of a
Commercial Unit, which would assume responsibilities now shared by Opera-
tions and Finance; and establishment of separate Electronic Data Processing
and Audit units.
Personnel
6.          Staffing - Total staff is 671 employees, of which 350 work in
the water and sewerage service (230 direct, 120 allocated to general admi-
nistration). With 7.5 employees per 1,000 connections, the water and sew-
erage service is slightly over staffed, as seems to he the case for other
services.  A freeze of the total number of employees is in effect.  The
quality of the middle management team and  professionals (total 35), as
EMC's staff in general, is adequate for the present complexity of opera-
tions. Under the project EMC is expected to reach a ratio of 6.0 employees
per 1000 water connections by 1989.   Technical assistance and training
under the project are expected to upgrade the quality of EMC's staff and to
fine tune staffing needs.
7.          Personnel Management and Training - Needs improvement.   EMC
lacks specific recruitment policies and does not carry out personnel eva-
luations routinely. Professional staff is sometimes given the opportunity
to attend training courses, but EMC lacks a structured training program.
Under the project, consultants would assist EMC in introducing improved
personnel policies and develop a permanent training program.
8.          Planning - Needs improvement.   The Planning Unit has almost
exclusively dedicated itself to supporting and supervising consultants in
the preparation of the proposed project. In the past EMC has done little
pianning and in particular lacks long-term physical and financial planning,
and short term cash planning. Technical assistance and training would be
provid-ed under the proposed project to establish in EMC an appropiate in-
house planning capability.
9           Project execution - Adequate.  Small works are satisfactorily
carried out either directly by EMC or by force account. Contractors carry
out larger works under supervision of consultants (interventores), who in
turn are supervised by EMC (the Project Coordination Office). This system
has worked well and will be maintained during project execution. The Pro-
ject Coordination Office is adequately staffed.

ANNEX 2

Operations and Maintenance
10.         Water and sewerage - Needs improvement.  Maintenance and opera-
tion of the water supply and sewerage systems suffers from the lack of sys-
tematic preventive maintenance procedures, of equipment and of repair
facilities.   A leak-detection and repair unit is in place,  but needs
strengthening.   Technical assistance, purchase of equipment and training
would aim at introducing improved maintenance and operational systems and
procedures, including special efforts to reduce water losses and improve-
ment of pressure zoning.
11.         Solid waste - Needs improvement.   Suffers from the same pro-
blems as the water and sewerage service. Collection is expected to improve
substantially after delivery of several collection trucks.   Consultants
under the project would assess the functioning of EMC's solid waste service
and introduce inter alia improved systems for final disposal (sanitary land
fill), collection of waste in poor neighborhoods and maintenance and repair
of equipment.
12.         Slaughterhouse - Adequate.
13.         Purchasing and inventory - Needs some improvement.  This res-
ponsibility is divided among several operating units which carry out pur-
chases according to observed needs.   There is overstock of seldom used
items. A catalogue of materials is lacking. Improvements are expected to
be made through technical assistance under the project.
Commercial System
14.         Customer file - Current and adequate.
15.         Metering - Needs improvement.   Of EMC's 46,000 connections,
only about 30,000 have working meters. EMC's staff reads meters bimonthly
but lack of coordination among EMC units and poor records prevent timely
replacement and repair of meters. Technical assistance under the project
would improve all aspects of metering.
16.         Billings - Needs improvement.   Monthly billings (50% of bi-
monthly readings are billed per month) are prepared by the computer center
of the local university. Because of the center's high workload, the pre-
paration of bills suffers an average delay of one month. Technical assis-
tance under the project would identify the most appropriate alternative for
the production of bills.
17.         Collections - Needs some improvement.  Customers pay in EMC's
offices and banks. EMC cherges its customers a 3% monthly interest rate on
overdue balances upon a second billing, and disconnects the service after a
third billing is unpaid.   It enforces collection  through legal means

ANNEX 2

of accounts overdue more than a year. Deficient commercial records are an
obstacle to efficient collection.  Technical assistance under the project
would improve the collection system.
Information and Control
18.         Management reporting system - Needs substantial improvement.
EMC prepares financial statements and budget compliance reports quarterly
with 2-3 months delays. It also compiles physical and commercial monitor-
ing indicators for the water and sewerage service which, however,are not
adequate for making sound management decisions. Consultants under the pro-
ject would assist EMC in implementing an improved management reporting sys-
tem.
19.         Accounting system - Needs substantial improvement.  EMC's chart
of accounts permits the preparation of separate income statements for each
service (on an accrual basis) and the classification of most balance sheet
items by service. The accounting system does not, however, allow the iden-
tification of transactions among services and the preparation of separate
balance sheets by service.  There is no cost accounting system.  Lack of
coordination between EMC's units, caused primarily by unclearly defined
flows of documents, is responsible for inaccurate or out of date account
balances.   EMC keeps accounts manually and uses an accounting machine.
Under the project, consultants would design and assist EMC in introducing
an appropriate financial and cost accounting system.
20.         Fixed assets - Needs some improvement.   The accounting unit
records work ir progress and fixed assets in operation with delays ca;...ed
by inadequate reporting from other EMC units. Fixed assets have individual
records,  and were revalued in 1981.   A satisfactory estimate of  1983
revalued fixed assets is available. The accounting and physical control of
fixed assets are acceptable.
21.         Budgeting system - Needs substantial improvement.   It is not
consistent either with managerial responsibilities or with the accounting
system. Budget information is only of limited use as a management tool and
difficult to reconcile with accounting information. The Budget Unit keeps
records and prepares reports manually and processes the same documents pro-
cessed by the Accounting Unit. Taking into account compliance with the law
and municipal requirements, technical assistance under the project would
devise a more efficient budgeting system which wold be more useful as a
management tool and compatible with the accounting system and long-range
financial planning.
22.         Electronic data processing (EDP) - Non-existent.   EDP work
beyond the preparation of inputs for the preparation of water supply, sew-
erage and solid waste bills is carried out bv the University's computer

ANNEX 2
Page 5
center. Consultants under the technical assistance program would determine
EMC's EDP needs and introduce an approplate EDP capability.  ED? equipment
and training of EMC's personnel would be financed under the project.
23.         Internal  Auditing  -  Needs  improvement.    Compliance  with
internal controls, which are not clearly defined, Is not systematically
verified.  The Municipal Controller ensures complian_e with the law and the
budget.   External auditors carry out limited internal control reviews
needed to issue an opinion on the financial statements. Consultants under
the project would develop an internal audit program and assist EMC in
implementing it.
24.         Insurance - Adequate.  EMC insures buildings against fire and
automotive equipment against third party liability.

1.         The vehicle for improviag the Borrower's institutional capabili-
ties (ParL E of the ProjecL) would be technical assistance supplemented by
training of the Borrower's personnel and the acquisition of equipment in
the three following areas:
(a) organization, administration, management control systems,
Lariffs and charges;
(b)  maintenance and operation for all of Lhe Borrower services;
and
(c) unaccounted-for water control including leak detecLion and
repair.
2.          Technical assistance under the project would be carried out by
qualified local consultants who in specialized areas would draw on foreign
expertise.  The technical assistance assignments would be entrusted to a
small number of consulting firms or jolat ventures of firms in order to
ensure efficient coordination of the work and to keep the Borrower's super-
vision effort to a minimum. The main objective of the technical assistance
programs would be to build on and improve existing systems. The assistance
would be implementation oriented. On-the-job training by the consultants
complemeuLed by outside training tO meet special needs would be the main
vehicle for technology transfer, the implementation of more efficient sys-
Lems and practices and enhancement of staff productiviLy.  The Improved
systems and practlces which would be introduced under the project would
represent "appropriate technology' that can be applied successfully by Lhe
human resources available to EMC.
3.          The implementation of the technical assistance programs would
proceed through the following five phases:
(a)  Phase 1  would involve a thorough review of the Borrower's
present systems and procedures by the consultants to spot
deficiencies and define areas which need improvement and Lo
formulate, in close coordinatlon with the Borrower, recom-
mendations for lmprovemeat and an action plan for lmplement-
ation.   An interim report or- each major subjecL would be
prepared with the following content:
(i)   assessment of existing systems and deficiencies;

side training for Lhe Borrower's personael; and
(v)   a comprehensive plan of actioa for implemeating Lhe
proposed systems.
(b)  Phase 2  would involve Bank review and commenL and discus-
Siong with the Borrower on the recommendations for improve-
ment and the action plaa formulated during Phase 1;
'd) Phase 3 would involve the detailed designs and their imple-
menLation in accordance with the action plan which would be
closely monitored through the review of progress reports and
field visits by Bank sLaff; and
Ce) Phase 4 would involve an assessment of the achievements of
Lhe Lechnical assistance effort and, if necessary, follow-up
action.
4.             In addition to the techaical assisLance coasultancies for
strengthening EMC's institutional capabilities, the project would include
consultant's services for Lhe following tasks (Part F of the Project):

PROPOSED CUCUTA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
ENPRESAS MUNICIPALES DE CUCUTA (EMC)
Financial Analysis
Introduction
1.         In addition to water supply and sewerage services (which account
for 65% of EMC's total revenues), EMC is providing solid waste collection
and disposal, slaughterhouse and market services in the city of Cucuta.
EMC's finances have been weak.   However, it is expected to overcome its
financial weakness, satisfactorily finance the project and develop into a
self-sustainiag municipal services agency during project execution.   To
achieve this, in addition to expanding services under the project (water,
sewerage and drainage), EMC would have to increase tariffs substantially
and  to  improve  its  operational efficiency.   EMC's past and present
financial performance, the project financing plan and EMC's projected
future performance are discussed below.
EMC's Past Financial Performance
2.          Mainly because of very low tariffs, which remained unchanged
since 1980, the operating results of EMC's water and sewerage service were
unsatisfactory during 1978-1982.1/  While expenses, primarily because of
inflation and expanding services, quadrupled during 1978-1982, operating
revenues only tripled.   EMC's water supply and sewerage income before
depreciation, equivalent to 33% of revenues in 1978, was very small in
1982. The rate of return on revalued fixed assets in 1982 was minus 5.3%
against 6.3% covenanted in the INSFOPAL-EMC project agreement under Bank
Loan 1072-CO.2/  Since it was short of internally generated cash, EMC's
water supply and sewerage service financed its modest 1978-1982 investment
program mainly with loans and government grants.
3.        Because of low tariffs, EMC's solid waste and market services had
persistent losses during 1978-1982; these losses were insufficiently
balanced by moderate profits of the slaughterhouse service.  Thus, EMC's
1/ Financial statements and summaries for 1978-1982 for all of EMC's
services and combined are available in the project file.
2/ 1982 is the first year in which acceptable revalued fixed assets and
depreciation figures are available.   Rates of return for 1978-1981 are
estimated at around minus 2%.

ANNEX 8

overall operating results were unsatisfactory, and the solid waste and
market services diverted resources from the slaughterhouse and the already
strained water supply and sewerage service. Since October 1982, however,
increased revenues from the slaughterhouse service because of a seven fold
tariff increase after complete modernization of the old slaughterhouse and
EMC's miscellaneous revenues have covered solid waste deficits fully.
EMC's Present Financial Performance
4.        A 90% tariff increase in April 1983 followed by monthly increases
of 1.5% improved the financial performance of the water and sewerage ser-
vice substantially. Although the water and sewerage service is expected to
have a rate of return of 0.5%, it is expected to cover its operating
expenses, debt service and working capital needs out of its revenues in 19-
83 (Attachment 1).
5.        Although slaughtering has decreased because of Cucuta's depressed
economy and lower demand of services from Venezuela after the devaluation
of the Bolivar, the profits of the slaughterhouse service nevertheless are
projected to cover most of the solid waste service deficit in 1983. Since
the market service is about breaking even and since EMC earns substantial
rental revenues, income frome the water and sewerage service is not needed
to cover deficits in other services.   On a consolidated basis, EMC is
expected to cover adequately Its operating expenses, debt service and work-
ing capital needs in 1983 (Attachment 3).
Water and Sewerage Revenues
6.          EMC's water aad sewerage service derives revenues mainly from
tariffs on water and sewerage services and from charges on new water and
sewerage connections. EMC also earns interest on overdue receivables (to
which it charges 3% monthly) and miaor non-operating revenues.
7.        Because present water and sewerage tariffs are still low, raising
them gradually over a period of time would not inflict undue hardship on
EMC's customers.   Average combined water and sewerage tariffs (customers
with sewerage service have a 50% surcharge over the water bill) were
Col$11.3 m3 (US$0.14/m3) and average monthly bills per connection Col$397
(US$5) during 1983.   This is about 50% of what customers are paying in
Bogota and Cali.
8.           EMC's customers are divided in five residential categories
according to the quallty of dwellings (a proxy for income levels), and
single categories for comnprce, industry and official customers and mixed
business/residential categories.  Tariffs are progressive.  EMC's tariff
structure, in effect January 1, 1984, is presented in Attacbment 4.



- 55 -
ANNEX 8
Page 3
The water allowance at a minimum cost for each category is 20 m3 a month.
Unmetered costumers (about 65% of total) pay fixed charges approximately
equal  to average  metered  billings  for  their  category.    High  income
customers pay tariffs about five times higher than those paid by low income
customers, approximately in line with other Colombian cities. Although the
present tariff structure is not unreasonable, EMC would improve it, with
the assistance of consultants under the project, to further encourage water
conservation and to distribute charges among customers more equitably.
9.        Connection charges account for about 20% of EMC's water and sew-
erage operating revenues. They include fees for the provision of new water
supply and sewerage connections, and assessments equal to 3% of the pro-
perty value for water and 0.5% for sewerage. The average present combined
charge for a joint water/sewerage connection is about Col$28,000 (US$350)
which customers pay in one to 3.5 years depending upon their socioeconomic
capability.  Under the current system, the sewerage connections charge is
only 10% of the combined charge.  Based on cost, the sewerage connection
charge should be about 40% of the combined charge. To correct this distor-
tion, EMC would develop a more adequate system of connection charges with
the assistance of consultants.
Water and Sewerage Expenses and Debt Service
10.       Relatively low operating expenses which could be further reduced
and a moderate debt burden give EMC's water and sewerage service flexibil-
ity to increase its internal cash generation.   EMC should be able to
Improve the personnel per 1,000 water connections ratio from the present
7.5 to the 6.0 forecasted by 1989.   The total current debt service is
equivalent to 27% of operating revenues in 1983.
Collection of Receivables
11.       Although improvement is required, E'IC's collection of receivables
is acceptable.   Receivables for water, sewerage and solid waste tariff
revenues are about 3.0 months of billings (in addition to a chronic bill
processing lag of one month). Overdue receivables for water and sewerage
connection charges amount to around 3 months of billings. Receivables from
official customers are on the order of six months of billings to these cus-
tomers and  of  10% of total EMC receivables.   EMC's receivables  for
slaughterhouse and market services are very small. Under the project EMC
should reduce overdue receivables for each service and on a consolidated
basis  to no more than  2.5 months  of revenues  by  the  end  of  1985.

fees which cover operating costs.  The Colombian Government has to author-
ize iacreases in solid waste Lariffs, buL EMC's Board alone can increase
slaughLerhouse and market tariffs.
ProjecL Financing
13.       Duriag project execution (1984-1992), EMC plans Lotal invesLments
equivalenL Lo about US$47  million in current prices, of which US$37.9
millioa (which include US$5.1 million of capitalized interest) are for the
Back financed project (AtLachment 2). The remaining US$9.1 million are for
addiLional connecLion and secondary necworks (partly donated by developers)
and maintenance investments financed by EMC's internal cash generation.
The proposed Bank loan would be US$18.5 million, of which US$15.3 million
would finance works and technical assistance and US$3.2 million interest
and related charges during the grace period. Local financing would be a
US$6.9 million equivalent GoveramenL granL (Col$800 million), and a US$4.2
milliou equivalent loan (Col$600 million) from local financial inStiLu-
tions, most likely through Fondo Financiero de Desarrollo Urbano (FFDU).
The remaining US$8.3 million of project COSt would be financed by EMC's
internal cash generation.
14.        The GovernmenL grant is expected to be disbursed during 1984-
1986, and the local loaa during 1986-1987.   Government officials have
assured the Bank that the Col$800 million grant, of which Col$450 million
are included in Lhe 1984 budget, would be available to finaace the pro-
ject. FFDU has expressed, through a letter of intent, its preparedness Lo
make available Lhe Col$600 million loan (10 years, 1 year grace, 24%
inLerest, unsecured) in a timely fashlon.
Projected Financial Performance
16.       Financial projections for the water supply and sewerage service
are provided in Attachment 1.  They are predicated on the basis of Lhe
water and sewerage service contributing US$15.2 million of internal cash
generation to finance its 1984-1992 total investment program (Attachment
2), which requires that this service: increases tariffs gradually in real
terms from 1985 uatil 1990 by abouL 60% above the present level; increases
average connection charges yearly in line with inflation; reduces staff per
1,000 connection from 7.5 in 1983 to 6.0 in 1989; and keeps overdue

ANNEX 8
Page 5
receivables at no more than 2.5 months of billings since 1985. In addition
to macroeconomic assumptions (inflation, exchange rates), the projections
are based on the following:   chemicals and energy costs increase in line
with water produced, and energy costs take into account the higher unit
costs of the new aqueduct; material and administrative costs increase in
line with inflation and the number of water and sewerage connections; and
balance sheet items change approximately in line with revenues and/or
expenses.
17.         Water supply and sewerage rates of return on revalued fixed
assets are expected to gradually climb from about 1.0% in 1984 to about 7%
in 1990 and then remain at around 7% in 1991-1993.   These rates should
permit enough internal cash generation to finance the project and other
expected investments.   Debt service coverage is expected to he in the
3.0-1.5 range during 1984-1993. The current ratio and debt/debt + equity %
ratio would he in the 6.5-3.5 and the 45Z-20% range, respectively.   To
reach the projected rates of return during 1984-1993, EMC should increase
tariffs and connection charges annually by around 18%-32% and 18%-20Z,
respectively (inflation 20X-18%).
18.       Each of the services other than water and sewerage is expected to
be financially self-sufficient after 1984.  In 1984, while revenues from
other services would cover the solid waste deficit, EMC is expected to
cover operating expenses working capital needs and debt service on a conso-
lidated basis (Attachment 3).

CUCUTA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAG.3 PROJECT
Economic Analysis
1.        Using tariffs required to meet the covenanted rates of return as
a proxy for economic benefits, internal rates of return were calculated for
the water supply component (74% of the total project cost), the sewerage
component (18% of total project cost) and for water supply and sewerage
combined  (92% of total project cost).   Cost aad revenue calculations
including a summary of assumptions are showa in Attachment 1.  Detailed
data are available in the project file.
2.        In the following, the main result of the analyses are summarized.

CUCUTA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Assumptions for the Economic Analysis
Water Supply
1.        Incremental population served includes all additional people con-
nected to the system beginning in 1985 and extending through the year 2008,
when the first stage of the Zulia River water scheme is expected to be
fully utilized.
2.          Incremental number of connections and consumption are obtained
from incremental population assuming 6 persons per connection and a con-
sumption of 36m3/connection/month.
3.         Incremental production is obtained by adjusting incremental con-
sumption for unaccounted-for water (Annex 10).   The Zulia River scheme
begins contributing water in 1989 supplementing the production of the
existing El Portico plant.   The El Portico plant is assumed to produce
water near its full capacity throughout the period of analysis since water
production by means of this plant is less expensive than that produced by
the Zulia River scheme.
4.         Revenues stem from tariff income and connection charges.  Tariff
levels are based on tariff forecasts (Annex 8, Attachment 1) expressed in
June 1984 prices. Water connection fees and right of service charges, as
forecasted in Annex 8 are applied to all incremental connections between
1989 and 2008.
5.           Investment  costs include all water related expenditures for
treatment, primary distribution, pumping, transmission, storage metering,
secondary distribution and connection. Th'y are based on costs developed
in the consultant's master plan for water supply.   In calculating the
investment costs for secondary networks, it is assumed that 45% of new con-
nections would be made in areas with secondary networks already in place.
The construction cost for secondary networks is estimated at US$200/connec-
tions in June 1984 prices.  The cost for all incremental connections is
included at US$66 per connection in June 1984 prices. All investment costs
include engineering and physical contingencies and make allowance for the
replacement of equipment.
6.        Operating costs include cost for operating personnel, administra-
tion, chemicals, energy and materials. Operating personnel and materials
cost are based on the present cost per connection and assume a gradual 30%

increase in efficiency by the end of 1987.   Incremental administration
costs are assumed to be 30% of operating personnel cost.  Chemical costs
are projected to continue at the current level of Col$1.15/m3.   Energy
costs are based on an electricity price of Col$3.50/kwh.   Annual energy
cost estimates for the Zulia River system take into account time of pumping
and the hydraulic head for pumping water from the Termotasajero Power Plant
to the Atalaya storage tank in Cucuta.
7.        Shadow pricing  is applied only for the unskilled labor component
of investment and operating costs.  It is estimated at 15% of total cost.
Foreign exchange is not shadow-priced since the Government's policy is
aimed at reaching a real exchange rate equilibrium level in 1984 in rela-
tion to the US$.  The efficiency wage rate is derived on the assumption
that without the project, only an average of about 70% of the available
unskilled labor force in Cucuta is engaged in productive activities. The
market wage rate is assumed to represent the marginal productivity of labor
and the efficiency wage rate (EWR) is estimated as:
EWR - R X P - 0.93 X 0.7 - 0.66
where R is the consumption conversion factor used to convert the opportu-
nity cost of labor into border prices and P is the probability of hiring a
previously employed worker.
Sewerage
8.          Incremental population  served includes all additional people
connected to the sewerage system beginning in 1985 and extending through
1992. Between 1992 and 1998 another 1600 connections (10Z of total incre-
mental connections at the end of 1991) are added estimating that the popu-
lation density in areas provided with a sewerage infrastructure under the
project would reach the saturation level by 1998.
9.        Incremental connections  are obtained from incremental population
assuming 6 persons per connection.
10.       Incremental sewerage flow is assumed to be 80% of water consumed
by incremental population connected to the sewer system.
11.         Revenues stem from sewerage tariffs (50% of water tariff) and
connection charges and were calculated according to the principles employed
for water supply calculations (para. 4).
12.         Investment costs include all sewerage related expenditures for
interceptors, collectors, and treatment during the project period and for
secondary networks and connections through 1998. About 50% of new connec-
tions are estimated to be made to already existing networks or provided by
developers.
