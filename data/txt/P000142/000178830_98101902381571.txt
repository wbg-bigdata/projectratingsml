INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF BOTSWANA
FOR A THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Botswana for the equivalent of US$20.0 million for a Third
Education Project. The loan would have a term of 17 years, including four
years of grace, with interest at 11.6 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY1
2.       Botswana is a landlocked country in Southern Africa, bordered by the
Republic of South Africa (RSA), Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. With an area of
570,000 sq km and an estimated population of 800,000 (1980), it is not densely
populated. Over 80 percent of the population is concentrated along the
relatively fertile eastern third of the country, however, as two thirds of the
country is covered by the Kalahari Desert. Rainfall is erratic and drought
frequent.
3.       Botswana's economy has historically been centered on the livestock
industry, which has been the principal source of income in rural Botswana.
Social institutions have guaranteed access to communal grazing lands and
established cattle ownership as a symbol of status. Manufacturing is domi-
nated by beef-processing and the use of animal by-products. Although
supported by preferential access to the lucrative European Economic Community
(EEC) market, the livestock industry has been plagued in recent years by
outbreaks of hoof and mouth disease and both livestock and crop farming have
been periodically devastated by drought.
4.       In the 1970s, diamond, nickel and copper mining became the main spur
to economic growth, leading to real increases in GDP of 10 percent a year
during the decade. The value of diamond production alone more than quadrupled
between 1977 and 1980 and diamonds now account for more than 50 percent of
exports. The production of copper/nickel also rose rapidly despite technical
difficulties and volatile prices, and exports currently account for about 20
lThe most recent economic memorandum on Botswana (Report No. 1832-BT)
was distributed to the Executive Directors on April 20, 1978. This section on
the economy incorporates information from an updating mission whose report
is scheduled for distribution in December 1981. Country data are given in
Annex I.



- 2 -
percent of total exports. The trade and services sectors expanded more
rapidly than overall GDP, and government services alone increased in excess of
11 percent a year. However, agricultural value added stagnated, particularly
in the second half of the decade. In the arable sector low returns, caused in
part by the lack of appropriate technical packages and the availability of
cheap food imports from the RSA, resulted in a fall in productivity and
output. In the livestock sector, low off-take rates and cattle diseases did
not allow for significant increases in production. Nevertheless, as a result
of the favorable growth of the overall economy, per capita GNP2 rose from
US$110 in 1970 to about US$720 in 1979.
5.       The balance of payments and fiscal situations also improved during
the past decade.  Increased receipts from the Customs Union,3 direct taxes
and mineral royalties caused recurrent revenues to rise nearly 33 percent a
year, which was substantially in excess of the growth in recurrent expend-
iture. Recurrent budgetary surpluses, together with grants, covered nearly
half of the steadily growing capital expenditures and the Government became a
net creditor of the banking system. Since 1973, the economy has also shown
overall surpluses in the balance of payments, due primarily to the rapid rise
in exports and to large private capital inflows associated with mining invest-
ments. By end December 1980, net international reserves had risen to about
US$261 million, equivalent to more than six months merchandise imports.
Inflation was moderate throughout most of the past decade; however, instabi-
lity in the world economy caused domestic inflation to accelerate in recent
years. The pula was revalued on several occasions since 1979 in an effort to
reduce the impact on the domestic economy of external price increases.
6.       Despite the economy's favorable performance with respect to overall
growth and balance of payments and budgetary stability, the mineral led deve-
lopment has only modestly increased the number of employment opportunities for
Botswana's labor force. Cattle raising and crop farming have remained the
main economic activity for about 80 percent of the population. However, an
increasing concentration of cattle ownership has effectively reduced the
options for about 50 percent of the population to make under prevailing
conditions a reasonable living from farming alone. The major challenge in the
present decade is, therefore, to provide employment opportunities for Botswana's
labor force, which is growing at over 3 percent a year.4 The Government's
strategy is to utilize the resources flowing from the mining sector to provide
2Calculated by the Bank Atlas method.
3The Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU), comprising Botswana,
Lesotho, Swaziland and RSA, is administered by South Africa. Import duties
and excise taxes are levied and collected by South Africa, deposited into a
common pool and then distributed to the members based on each country's share
in production and trade.
4Reductions in employment opportunities for Batswana in RSA may
compound the problem.

the infrastructure and services required by the more labor intensive
productive sectors. These sectors face formidable constraints, and generating
a sufficient number of attractive work opportunities will not be an easy task.
7.       One of the most serious constraints on growth of the productive
sectors is the severe shortage of skilled technical, managerial and profes-
sional manpower, which greatly impairs the country's absorptive capacity,
encourages the use of capital intensive technology, raises production costs,
and stifles investment. A high proportion of skilled and professional
positions are filled by expatriates and many posts in Government and the
private sector are inadequately staffed. The manufacturing sector is further
constrained by the small domestic market, the country's limited raw materials
base and landlocked position, and competition from South Africa and Zimbabwe.
8.       It is the agricultural sector that is looked upon as the main source
for employment. However, at present productivity in agriculture is very low.
Crop farming is circumscribed by the limited availability of suitable land, by
sparse and erratic rainfall, by lack of draught power and by low farm-gate
prices. Appropriate policy changes should help overcome some of these
constraints and enhance production and employment. Nevertheless, the sector's
ability to support additional labor may always remain limited, as ecological
conditions render most parts of the country more favorable to livestock than
crop production. Cattle raising, however, does not require high labor
inputs. Moreover, the system of communal grazing, the traditional values
associated with cattle and, more recently, the granting of substantial
subsidies to cattle owners, have given rise to overstocking and progressive
land degradation. If sustained, this trend could further reduce the sector's
growth and employment opportunities.
9.       The Government is moving ahead with programs to deal with these
constraints. The Fifth National Development Plan, 1979-85 (NDP V) accords
high priority to education, with emphasis on primary education, as a means of
alleviating the country s manpower constraint. Industry is being supported
through promotional activities by the Botswana Development Corporation and
through the provision of tax breaks, preference in bidding for government
contracts, favorable interest rates and seed capital for investors. A Tribal
Grazing Lands Program (TGLP), with the primary aim of controlling overstocking
and range degradation, while at the same time increasing incomes from cattle
raising by improving herd quality, enhancing range management and boosting
operating efficiency, has been underway since 1975. An Arable Lands Develop-
ment Program (ALDEP), a multi-faceted program designed to raise productivity
in crop farming, was introduced in 1979. Both ALDEP and TGLP are expected to
permit more labor intensive use of the land.
10.       Botswana's economic prospects, although bright in macro terms, are
clouded by problems of employment and income distribution. Expanding diamond
production and exports from the new mine at Jwaneng are expected to continue
fueling rapid overall economic growth - likely to average 10 per cent per
annum over the 1981-85 period - and to maintain strong balance of payments and
public finance positions. Progress is being made in raising the level of
skills and broadening the educational base. However, TGLP has not yet been
successful in rationalizing government investment and pricing policies in the
livestock industry and has focused largely on commercial ranching much to the
neglect of improving the productivity of cattle smallholders. The ALDEP



- 4 -
program is just getting started. Efforts to identify labor-intensive invest-
ments will have to be redoubled, however, if the country is to avoid serious
unemployment and maintain stable growth.
11.      Multi- and bilateral agencies have extended substantial assistance to
Botswana on highly concessional terms. More recently, however, loans from
international organizations have overtaken bilateral loans in Botswana's
external debt. The Bank Group has been the main multilateral source, but the
EEC, the African Development Bank and OPEC sources have also been active.
Bilateral assistance has come from several sources. In 1978, almost two
thirds of Botswana's outstanding bilateral debt was converted into grants. At
the end of 1980, total external debt outstanding and disbursed amounted to
US$148.5 million, debt service payments were US$11.8 million and the debt
service ratio 1.9 percent. Botswana is expected to continue to receive
substantial (but probably declining) assistance from bilateral sources on
grant or concessional terms; however, given its favorable economic prospects,
an increasing proportion of external financing is expected to come from
commercial sources. Botswana is expected to remain creditworthy for the
required external borrowing.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BOTSWANA
12.      To date, Botswana has received 17 Bank Group loans and credits
totalling US$137.4 million (excluding cancellations) comprised of six credits
for US$14.7 million and eleven loans for US$122.7 million, including US$3.5
million on third window terms. These loans and credits have financed five
road projects, two education projects, two livestock projects, two urban
projects, two water supply projects and one development finance corporation
project. Three loans, including one for engineering studies, have been for
the Shashe mining complex. IFC has had one investment in Botswana, a
US$370,000 equity participation in the Botswana Development Corporation (BDC),
which was approved in March 1979. Summary statements of Bank Group operations
in Botswana are provided in Annex II.
13.      The Bank Group's share of Botswana's external debt (disbursed only)
at the end of 1980 was about 44 percent (IBRD - 34 percent, IDA - 10 percent)
and its share in debt service was about 84 percent. A large part of debt
service payments to the Bank Group are for the Shashe mining infrastructure
loans of the early 1970s, which are guaranteed by a consortium of interna-
tional mining companies.
14.      Botswana's performance in planning and executing development projects
has been satisfactory. Bank assisted projects have been relatively problem
free, with two important exceptions: the Shashe project (Loans 776-1 and
776-2) and the livestock projects (Credit 325 and Loan 1497). Although the
infrastructure works for the Shashe mining complex were completed on time, the
mining operation has experienced technical and financial problems. The tech-
nical problems have been largely resolved; however, despite a second financial
restructuring of the mining company,Bamangwato Concessions, Ltd. (BCL), in
early 1980, it has continued to experience financial difficulties as a result



of low international copper and nickel prices. The Bank's first livestock
project has been completed and the credit closed, but many of the original
objectives of the project were not fully achieved. Most of the ranches
developed under the project continue to be overstocked and poorly managed,
control and use of water resources remains inadequate and the extension
services have been unable to alter inefficient traditional stocking patterns.
The Bank's second project, while successful in improving livestock marketing
systems through upgrading of trek routes, holding areas and railway sidings,
has not yet been successful in raising offtake rates and increasing beef
production, or in alleviating overstocking and range degradation. The Govern-
ment is pursuing proposals designed to remedy these problems.
17.      Future Bank Group operations in Botswana are expected to include
projects in power, urban development, population-health-nutrition,
education and possibly agriculture.
PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
Background
18.      Since independence in 1966, Botswana has made great strides in
expanding and improving its educational system. From an entirely private,
missionary operated system at independence, enrolling 71,500 primary and 1,500
secondary students studying mostly art and literature, the system has evolved
to one predominantly public with enrollment of 171,000 primary and 21,000
secondary students (1979/80) and with a curriculum placing more emphasis on
science and practical subjects. About 94 percent of the 6-12 year age group
was enrolled in primary school in 1979/80 and completion rates were nearly 80
percent. Entry into junior secondary school was available for 38 percent of
the 1978/79 primary school graduates. Teacher qualification has also improved
significantly since independence, education sector infrastructure has expanded
considerably and vocational, technical and non-formal education have grown
rapidly. These achievements were largely the result of the high priority
accorded to education by the Botswana authorities.
17.      Despite these advances, education in Botswana is still deficient in
many respects. There remains a serious shortage of physical infrastructure,
particularly primary school classrooms, many teachers are under-qualified and
there is a high dependence on expatriate teachers. In addition, curricula
continue unbalanced in favor of literary subjects and access at all education
levels requires improvement. Academic performance has deteriorated in recent
years as the system has been unable to maintain quality in a period of rapid
expansion. Consequently, an increasing proportion of students each year is
inadequately prepared for entry into the next educational level, and school
leavers continue to be inappropriately trained to play a productive role in
Batswana society.



- 6-
Education Structure and Administration
18.      Formal education in Botswana consists of seven years of primary
education, three years of junior secondary and two years of senior secondary
school, and various degree, diploma and certificate programs in higher edu-
cation offered by the University College of Botswana (UCB). Vocational and
technical education are provided by a number of public and private insti-
tutions, the major ones of which are: (a) the Botswana Polytechnic, which
offers craft and technical courses, including automobile mechanics, civil and
electrical engineering and electronics; (b) the Botswana Institute of Adminis-
tration and Commerce (BIAC), which offers courses in accounting, adminis-
tration, supplies management, clerical and secretarial studies and management
for civil servants; (c) the Institute of Development Management (TDM), which
offers training for senior management personnel in finance, personnel and
related subjects; and (d) the Youth Brigades, which combine training at craft
and artisan levels with productive activities, essentially for primary school
leavers. Non-formal education is provided by a host of government and other
agencies. Over the next several years the Government plans to restructure the
educational system with the aim of providing nine years of basic education to
all Batswana in the 6-15 year age group.
19.      Administrative responsibility for primary, secondary, non-formal
vocational and higher education (other than UCB) is vested in the Ministry of
Education (MOE), which oversees sector development plans, curriculum develop-
ment, teacher assignment and training and system inspection and supervision.
The MOE also ensures private school compliance with government regulations and
advises local authorities on the professional aspects of education. Each of
the country's nine districts and four townships has an elected local education
authority, with responsibilities related to school construction and mainte-
nance, the provision of school equipment and materials, the posting of
teachers and other administrative matters. The Rural Extension Coordinating
Committee, an inter-ministerial body under the aegis of the Ministry of
Finance and Development Planning, coordinates the non-formal education
programs of the various ministries and agencies.
Education Objectives, Strategy and Policy
20.      Botswana's educational objectives, as formulated by the 1977 National
Commission on Education and outlined in NDP V are: (a) to increase educa-
tional opportunities and reduce inequities in access to education; (b) to
contribute to balanced economic development by seeking to satisfy manpower
requirements in all sectors, particularly in rural areas; (c) to promote
personal qualities such as respect for national ideals, self-reliance and
concern for others, and to encourage full development of individual talents;
and (d) to expand the role of schools and colleges in the local communities
and vice versa. Within these general objectives, NDP V accords priority to
achieving universal primary education, improved and more equitable access to
junior secondary education and to qualitative improvement in primary and
secondary education. These areas have not been fully addressed in previous
years because of the emphasis given to vocational and technical education to
meet urgent manpower needs.



- 7 -
21.      The Government plans to provide seven years of universal primary edu-
cation by the mid-1980s, to significantly improve the quality of primary
education within that same time-frame, and by 1990, to provide nine years of
basic education to all children aged 6-15 under a restructured 6 + 3 + 3
system. This will require the construction of about 2,270 primary school
classrooms (400 to 500 per year, plus ancillary facilities) to reach the
Government's 1985 target of 80 percent class coverage, which will still leave
many classes on double shifts or in the open air. More rapid progress is
hampered by the lack of implementation capacity in some districts. An
increased supply of qualified teachers and improved qualification for existing
teachers would also be required for achievement of the Government's medium
term goals.
22.      Recent expansions at the three existing primary teacher training
colleges (PTTC), together with the new college included under the proposed
project, should reduce the deficit of trained teachers from 36 percent in 1979
to 25 percent in 1985. In addition, the expansion of rural education centers
providing in-service training, the requirement that PTTC candidates serve a
probationary year as teachers prior to entering college and the recruitment of
senior secondary graduates to the teacher ranks to fulfill their period of
compulsory community service is expected to help alleviate the shortage of
teachers and further improve teaching quality, especially in rural areas. The
USAID financed Primary Education Improvement Project will provide major
institutional assistance to the training of PTTC staff, primary school head
teachers and primary school inspectors. A Department of Primary Education
will be established at UCB and will provide support to the PTTCs by assisting
in updating primary school and PTTC curricula and by improving teaching
methods. The MOE will increase the quantity and quality of teaching aids and
learning materials available to the schools.
23.      Improved organization and administration of primary education will
also be required as the Government's plans evolve. The Government also plans
to restructure the secondary education system and has instituted programs
directed towards improving the quality of private community junior secondary
schools and establishing new ones financed jointly by government and local
communities. A limited senior secondary school expansion program is underway
to meet the increased demand resulting from increased junior secondary enroll-
ment. Overall, an additional 9,000 junior secondary and 900 senior secondary
school places will be provided during the NDP V period. These increases will
enable 50 percent of primary school graduates to progress to junior secondary,
as against the present 38 percent, but given the expected large increase in
junior secondary graduates, will reduce the progression rate to senior
secondary school from 34 percent to about 29 percent. This policy should,
however, substantially strengthen basic education, particularly in mathematics
and the sciences, and eventually contribute to better-prepared students
entering higher education and to increasingly educated and skilled manpower.
24.      Meeting the targets for increased enrollments, better teachers and
less reliance on expatriates will require a substantial effort in training
secondary school teachers. It is estimated that about 350 new teachers will
be needed in the 1979-85 period just to meet increased enrollments, with
another 115 Batswana teachers required to reach the Government's goal of



- 8 -
reducing the proportion of expatriates from the present 70 percent to 38
percent by 1985. The degree-level intake at UCB has been increased, the
African Development Bank (AfDB) is expected to finance a junior secondary
teacher training college and training programs for practical subjects are
being developed. The Government also proposes to increase its financial
support to the Community Junior Secondary Schools by paying part of the
salaries of expatriate teachers and by providing allowances to cover the cost
of textbooks and materials. It also plans to provide increased professional
and technical services to these schools.
25.      The early 1980s will be a period of consolidation for the University
of Botswana, with enrollment expected to grow by only seven percent a year,
compared with 18 percent in recent years. Plans for this period include
introduction of programs to train tutors for the PTTCs and for head teachers
and inspectors. The University also expects to introduce a one-year post-
graduate course in education and, through its Institute of Adult Education,
hopes to stimulate interest in and develop links between adult education and
productive activities. With these programs the University is expected to make
an important contribution to upgrading the nation's manpower. By 1985 when
the joint college arrangements between Botswana and Swaziland are expected to
end, UCB will have been upgraded to full university status.
26.      Technical and vocational education are being expanded in the NDP V
period, but with emphasis on making existing programs more effective in
meeting the country's manpower needs rather than on maximizing their growth.
Additional expatriate staff will be employed in conjunction with a staff deve-
lopment program that will geek to identify a local counterpart for each
expatriate appointment. The role of the Brigades is currently under review by
the Government, and it appears that some may be turned into rural trade
schools, others may be more heavily subsidized to increase their effectiveness
and still others may remain autonomous, though with some assistance from
various branches of the Government. Non-formal education programs are
expected to stress literacy (with a national campaign aimed at enrolling
15,000 participants annually), district and village level skill training and
greater learning opportunities for women.
Education Finance
27.      Basic education in Botswana is financed largely from general tax
revenues. Primary education is free for all students; however, at the
secondary level, fees are charged ranging from P 120 (US$154 equivalent) per
annum per student at public school to P 220 (US$282 equivalent) per annum per
student at private schools.
28.      Recurrent expenditures on education programs administered by MOE
represented about 20 percent of total Central Government recurrent expenditure
in 1979/80, having risen at an annual rate of about 15 percent in real terms
since 1976. More than three-fourths of these expenditures were directed
towards primary and secondary education. Capital expenditures on education
(including those financed by external donors) also increased rapidly during
this period and by 1979/80 had reached 15 percent of total Central Government
capital spending. Slightly over one-half of these expenditures were



- 9 -
administered by MOE and the remainder by the Ministry of Local Government and
Lands, which is responsible for the primary school construction program.
Total public expenditures on education and training rose from 5.2 percent of
GDP in 1976/77 to an estimated 6.3 percent in 1979/80.
29.      Under the NDP V, recurrent expenditure on education is expected to
remain at about 20 percent of total Central Government recurrent expenditure,
rising by about 10 percent a year in real terms. Even with this rate of
expenditure growth, some of the objectives of the Plan, such as localization
of teachers and achieving nine years universal basic education, may not be
reached within the allotted timeframe. Capital expenditures on education are
expected to continue rising sharply through the Plan period, although they may
be circumscribed by the country's limited capacity to implement projects.
Bank Experience and Strategy in the Sector
30.      The Bank Group has assisted in the development of Botswana's educa-
tion and training sector with two loans totalling US$20.5 million equivalent.
The first education project (Loan 1274-BT/1275-T-BT, May 1976) provided
US$10.5 million to: (a) increase the number of secondary school places by 30
percent; (b) provide additional secondary school teachers; (c) expand adult
education programs; (d) assist in expanding the Youth Brigade programs; and
(e) provide a rural multipurpose education center (Matsha Community College)
to serve the western Kalahari area. The second project (Loan 1828-BT, April
1980) provided US$10.0 million for: (a) classrooms and ancillary facilities
for about eleven community junior secondary schools; (b) construction of about
seven new community junior secondary schools; (c) assistance to about 16 Youth
Brigade Centers; (d) additional training facilities at the Botswana Institute
of Administration and Commerce and the Institute of Development Management;
and (e) technical assistance.
31.      Implementation of both these projects is proceeding satisfactorily,
although the first project encountered initial delays, particularly with
regard to the Matsha Community College. Staff constraints in the Project
Implementation Unit and the inability of the Ministry of Works and Communica-
tions to provide technical services as planned were the main causes of the
delays. There was also a need to strengthen the mechanism for evaluating the
Brigades program. These problems were addressed in the second project, and
project implementation has improved. The proposed Third Education Project
incorporates all of these lessons in its design and provides technical
assistance funds to ensure continuous services of a project director and to
strengthen the auditing capacity of the MLGL and the District Councils.
32.      The Government's policies and priorities for educational development
are sound and meet Bank criteria for assistance to the sector. Secondary and
vocational/technical education are being addressed in both the First and
Second Education Projects, as well as in projects supported by bilateral and
other multilateral donors. Botswana's needs in primary education are
substantial and critical to the development of an educated and productive man-
power supply. By helping to provide additional primary school classroom and
ancillary facilities in heretofore educationally disadvantaged areas and by
making available facilities for training additional primary school teachers,
the Bank is playing a crucial role in assisting Botswana in carrying out its
education sector strategy.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
33.      The proposed project was identified in November 1980, prepared by the
Government with Bank Group assistance in January/February 1981, and appraised
in March 1981. Negotiations were held in Washington in September 1981. The
Government delegation was led by Mr. 0. K. Matambo, Director of Economic
Affairs, Ministry of Finance and Development Planning. A Staff Appraisal
Report (No. 3549-BT, dated October 1, 1981) is being distributed separately.
Project Description
34.      The project would assist the Government in carrying out its five-year
educational program as set forth in the education and manpower chapter of
NDP V, and would consist of:
-  constructing, furnishing and equipping about 500 primary
school classrooms and related facilities (including
offices, storerooms, cooking and ablution areas and
staff houses);
-  supplying about 200,000 primary school level textbooks
and teachers guides;
- constructing, furnishing and equipping a. primary teacher
training college for about 300 student places;
-  providing of about 14 man-years of specialists services,
consisting of a project director/architect (about five
man-years) for the PIU and three accountancy specialists
(about nine man-years) to assist the Ministry of Local
Government and Lands and the Districts.
35.      Primary School Classrooms - The primary school classrooms and related
furnishings and facilities provided under the proposed project would represent
about 22 percent of the number required to enable the Government to reach its
target of meeting 80 percent of assessed needs by 1985. Sites for these
classrooms would be selected on the basis of agreed guidelines, which ensure
equity within and between Districts. Most of the classrooms would be sited in
rural areas. Modest staff housing would also be provided under the project,
since a critical shortage of housing exists in rural Botswana and it is
unlikely that teachers could be recruited and maintained in the schools
without housing.
36.      Primary School Textbooks - The project would assist in financing an
initial supply of elementary level math, English, Setswana and social studies
textbooks in support of the new primary school curriculum being developed by
the MOE with the assistance of USAID and other donor agencies.



- 11 -
37.      Primary Teacher Training College (PTTC) - To assist the Government
meet the need for trained primary school teachers until year 1990, the
proposed project provides for a new PTTC to be located at Tlokweng, a rural
area near Gaborone. The proposed PTTC would provide for 300 places, raising
total capacity for primary teacher training in Botswana by one-third,to 1,200
places, and increase annual output of trained teachers by 150, to 600. This
is consistent with primary school enrollment projections and with plans for
upgrading under-qualified primary school teachers. Moreover, the new PTTC
would be an integral component of a comprehensive plan to provide trained
teachers, incorporating the efforts of the various departments of UCB,
including the Departments of Primary and Special Education and the Primary
School Laboratory. The Department of Primary Education at UCB is being
assisted by a USAID grant for a primary education improvement project that
will train the necessary tutors for this PTTC. The site selected for the new
college is close to the UCB and adjacent to an eleven classroom primary school
that would provide opportunities for teaching and in-classroom training for
the PTTC's students.
38.      Technical Assistance and Professional Services - Five man-years of
technical assistance to provide for continuation of the PIU's project director
are included in the project. This will enable the PIU, which is administering
the First and Second Education Projects, to maintain its effectiveness until
completion of the proposed Third Education Project. In addition, nine man-
years of assistance is included to provide the services of three specialists
in acccounting to help strengthen bookkeeping and cost control within the
District Councils and the MLGL. Each specialist would be assigned a local
counterpart, who would be trained to carry on the work after the specialist's
departure. About 100 man-months of architectural and engineering services
would also be provided. The qualifications, experience and terms and
conditions of these specialists would be satisfactory to the Bank (Section
3.03, draft Loan Agreement), and they and their counterparts would be
appointed and in place as a condition of disbursement of the primary school
classroom component (Schedule 1, paragraph 4, draft Loan Agreement).
Female Participation in the Education System
39.      In 1980, 55. percent of the total enrollment in primary education was
female; in secondary education 56 percent of enrollment was female; and in
higher education 33 percent of those enrolled were women. Higher female
participation rates in primary and secondary school are attributed to the
custom of young males herding cattle during school hours. The proposed
project would improve educational opportunities for all students.
Project Cost and Financing
40.      Total project cost is estimated at US$30.0 million equivalent,
including taxes estimated at US$0.8 million equivalent. The proposed loan of
US$20.0 million equivalent would cover the foreign exchange component,
representing 68 percent of total project costs net of taxes. The balance of
the total project cost, US$10.0 million equivalent, including taxes, would be
financed by the Government.



- 12 -
41.      Cost estimates for the civil works, furniture and equipment were
derived from a review by Bank staff of data provided by (a) the Ministry of
Works and Communications, from its activities in the building industry; (b)
the PIU, based on its experience in recent contract awards under the First and
Second Education Projects, and (c) MLGL, based on its experience in super-
vising primary classroom construction in the districts to be involved in the
proposed project. The average unit base cost (October 1981 prices) of
constructing the primary classroom facilities is US$200/m2 equivalent, with
costs ranging from about US$159/m2 to US$278/m2 equivalent, depending on the
remoteness of location. These costs compare favorably with those experienced
recently in other African countries: Lesotho (1981) US$214/m2, Swaziland
(1979) US$160/r2, Kenya (1979) US$190/m2, Mauritius (1978) US$273/m2.  The
classroom facilities, furniture, etc. are austere in design and would make
maximum use of local materials and simple building techniques.
42.      The cost estimates for textbooks were prepared in conjunction with
MOE and the Government Printing Agency, and the cost of the technical
assistance component, about 168 man-months of specialists services, estimated
at about US$3,600 per man-month is based on past and on-going experience.
Professional services in architecture and engineering, about 100 man-months,
are estimated to cost about US$6,400 per man-month, including salary, overhead
and fees, which is in line with recent experience. For physical contin-
gencies, 10 percent has been added to the base costs of civil works and
professional services and 5 percent to the base costs of furniture, equipment
and textbooks. Price contingencies have been applied from the base date
(October 1981) at the following annual rates:
1981 1982 1983-87
Foreign/Local    12.0% 11.0%  10.0%
These contingency allowances are based on Bank experience in similar projects
for physical works and on the Bank's projections, agreed to by Government, of
inflation rates in Botswana and South Africa for prices. As most of
Botswana's imports originate in South Africa and inflation rates have been
very similar in the two countries, foreign and local price increases during
the project implementation period are expected to be the same.
Project Implementation
43.      The project would be implemented over five years.  The project
Implementation Unit established in the MOE to implement the First and Second
Education Projects would undertake the administrative functions for the
proposed project. It would also be responsible for coordination of the
various ministries and departments involved in the project, including the
MLGL. Incremental operating costs for the Unit are provided for through 1985
under the Second Education Project. The PIU is operating well and its key
staff have the necessary capabilities and experience. Any appointments to the
positions of project director, architect and procurement manager would be
satisfactory to the Bank (Section 3.02, draft Loan Agreement).



- 13 -
44.       The MLGL would be responsible for administration of the construction
of the primary school facilities; however, it would delegate actual imple-
mentation of this component to the nine district councils. Administrative
arrangements and procedures to carry out this work are well established and
have been used successfully in the past for similar type operations. The MLGL
would review work plans and cost estimates provided by the districts and,
after approval, allocate the necessary funds to the districts. The MLGL would
provide the Bank through the PIU:  (i) before the beginning of each of
Botswana's fiscal years, a work plan and budget satisfactory to the Bank for
the construction of primary school facilities, and (ii) an annual report
comparing actual work completed with that planned (Section 3.06, draft Loan
Agreement). Detailed supervision of construction contracts would be the
responsibility of the districts, for which both MLGL and MOWC would provide
assistance as required. The Councils would be financially accountable to
MLGL, which maintains an audit department to ensure adequate control over the
use of funds. Since there is a shortage of qualified financial staff in the
MLGL and the Districts, the project includes nine man-years of technical
assistance for three accountants to ensure that proper accounts are maintained
and to train MLGL and District personnel (para. 38).
Reporting and Evaluation
45.       Semi-annual reports on project implementation would be submitted to
the Bank for review no later than two months after the close of each period
(Section 3.08(b) iii, draft Loan Agreement). Within five months after the
loan closing date, the PIU, with the assistance of the MLGL and MOE, would
provide the Bank with an evaluation report covering all aspects of the project
execution, including lessons learned during implementation (Section 3.08 (d),
draft Loan AgrPement)
Procurement
46.       Contracts for civil works, furniture and equipment are expected to
total US$27.9 million. About US$15.7 million of this will be procured through
international competitive bidding under World Bank guidelines. Many of the
classroom construction, furniture and equipment tenders will likely to be too
small to attract international suppliers, however, though these will be
grouped to encourage their participation. It has, therefore, been agreed with
the Government that civil works contracts for classrooms and ancillary faci-
lities below US$250,000 (about US$11 million with contingencies) and for
furniture and equipment below US$50,000 (US$1.2 million with contingencies)
may be awarded by competitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance
with procedures satisfactory to the Bank (Schedule 4, Section C, draft Loan
Agreement). It was also agreed that textbook contracts, totalling US$500,000
including contingencies, will be negotiated directly with the Teaching Aids
Production Unit, the Government Printing Department and local textbook firms.
47.      Sketch designs, draft tender documents and master lists of furniture,
equipment and textbooks indicating proposed grouping and cost estimates would
be reviewed by the Bank. Again, items would be grouped to the extent
practicable to encourage competitive bidding and permit bulk procurement.
Review of tender evaluation documents prior to award would be required for



- 14 -
textbooks contracts and contracts above US$250,000 for civil works and
US$50,000 for furniture and equipment (Schedule 4, Section D, draft Loan
Agreement). With ICB domestic manufacturers of furniture and equipment would
be given a preference of 15 percent or the existing applicable rate of import
duties, whichever is lower, over the c.i.f. price of competing foreign
suppliers.
Disbursement
48.      Disbursements would be on the basis of:  (a) 63 percent of expend-
itures for civil works; (b) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for directly
imported furniture, equipment and textbooks; (c) 90 percent of local expend-
itures for locally manufactured furniture, equipment and textbooks; (d) 90
percent of expenditures for technical assistance; and (e) 80 percent of
expenditures for imported but locally procured furniture, equipment, textbooks
and professional services. All disbursements would be fully documented.
49.      Retroactive financing not exceeding US$150,000 for approved expend-
itures incurred after November 1, 1981 and prior to loan signing would be
allowed for architectural services and civil works for the PTTC (Schedule 1,
4(a), draft Loan Agreement).
Auditing
50.      All project expenditures would be audited yearly by auditors
acceptable to the Bank. The accountancy specialists provided under the tech-
nical assistance component (para. 39) would assist in preparation of the MLGL
and district accounts. The PIU would be responsible for the remaining
accounts. With respect to the primary school components, unaudited financial
statements would be submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the
end of each fiscal year, followed with audited statements within twelve months
after the year ending March 1983, within nine months after the year ending
March 1984 and within six months after subsequent years. Audit reports for
the remainder of the project would be submitted to the Bank within six months
of the end of the Borrower's fiscal year (Section 4.02(b), draft Loan
Agreement).
Benefits and Risks
51.      The proposed project would support the Government's priorities of
expanding educational opportunities and improving the quality of primary
education, particularly in rural areas.
52.      No special risks are foreseen.  Technical assistance will strengthen
the accounting practices of the MLGL and the districts and train counterparts
to ensure continuing sound accounting practices. Three of the nine districts
may have difficulty in implementing their primary school construction programs
within the proposed time schedule. However, SIDA assistance is expected to
strengthen administration in these districts. In any case, the matter would
be closely monitored during project supervision.

C. STATUS OF PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
AS OF SEPTEMBER 1, 1981
Loan No. 1019-BT      Botswana Development Corporation Project; US$4.0 Million
Loan of June 27, 1974; Effectiveness Date: December 9,
1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The Line of Credit to Botswana Development Corporation was fully
committed in June of this year.
Loan No. 1174-BT      Third Road Project, US$5.8 Million Loan of November 21,
1975; Effectiveness Date: January 12, 1976;
Closing Date: March 31, 1982
The project was amended in 1978 to include additional components to
utilize surplus funds. The Gaborone-Molepolole Road was completed satisfac-
torily in 1979 and only implementation of the District Roads Maintenance Pilot
Program remains to be finished. Project completion is expected to be one year
behind schedule because of a delay in recruiting technical assistance staff
with appropriate expertise to implement the pilot program.
Loans No. 1274-BT
and 1275-T-BT         Education Project; US$10.5 Million (US$7.0 Million Bank
and US$3.5 Million TW) of May 28, 1976; Effectiveness
Date: September 10, 1976; Closing Date: March 31, 1982
Implementation, after initial delays in completing building designs,
is proceeding satisfactorily and all components are expected to be completed
by the March 31, 1982 closing date. Project objectives are expected to be
achieved.
Loan No. 1408-BT       Fourth Road Project; US$420.0 Million Loan of May 20,
1977; Effectiveness Date: August 18, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project was amended in 1978 to use savings to pave an additional
17 km of roadway. The construction and studies components are proceeding on
schedule.

Loan No. 1497-BT      Second Livestock Project; US$6.5 Million Loan of December
30, 1977; Effectiveness Date: November 27, 1978;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983
The project is being intensively reviewed by the Bank and Government
in the light of poor performance in increasing cattle production and offtake
and reversing overgrazing trends through the establishment of commercial
ranches and communal grazing areas. Preliminary findings suggest that the
project was based on insufficient understanding of the economic and social
implications of the Government's Tribal Grazing Lands Policy, which it was
designed to support. Measures to improve livestock marketing by upgrading
trek routes, railway sidings and holding areas are, however, proceeding
extremely well.
Loan No. 1584-BT      Second Urban Project; US$8.0 Million Loan of September
11, 1978; Effectiveness Date: June 20, 1979; Closing
Date: December 31, 1982
Implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. Site improvements have
begun while legislation enabling town councils to recover service levies is
improving the cost recovery picture.
Loan No. 1763-BT      Second Water Supply Project; US$4.4 Million of January 9,
1980; Effectiveness Date: September 18, 1980; Closing
Date: December 31, 1982
Implementation is proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan No. 1828-BT      Second Education Project;  US$10.0 Million of April 16,
1980; Effectiveness Date: June 13, 1980;
Closing Date: June 30, 1985
Implementation is proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan No. 1941-BT      Fifth Road Project;  US$17.0 Million of February 1981;
Effectiveness Date: May 4, 1981;
Closing Date: October 1, 1984
This project became effective in May of this year and is proceeding
satisfactorily.
