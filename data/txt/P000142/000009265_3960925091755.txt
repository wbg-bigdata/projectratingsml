PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BOTSWANA
THIRD EDUCAXTION PROJECT
(LOAN 2057-BT)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Third Education
Project in Botswana, for which Loan 2057-BT of US$20.0 million was approved
on January 25, 1982. The Loan was closed on March 31, 1987, as scheduled.
The last disbursement was made on October 26, 1987, when an undisbursed
balance of US$1.93 million was cancelled, bringing the total amount can-
celled to US$10.43 million as US$8.5 million had been cancelled on December
19, 1984, following a Government request.
The PCR was prepared by UNESCO (Parts I and III) and the
Population and Human Resources Operations Division, Southern Africa
Department, Africa Regional Office (Preface and Summary).  It is based on
(i) the findings of the UNESCO project completion mission to Botswana
during September-October, 1988; (ii) discussions with people knowledgeable
about the project; and (iii) data from project files at Bank herdquarters
in Washington.
The Bank sent the Borrower Parts I and III of the draft PCR with a
request to prepare Part II by May 15, 1989. A reply has not been received.

THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2057-BT)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.       The Third Education Project (Education III) in Botswana was
identified by the Bank in November 1980 and prepared soon thereafter by the
Government with Bank assistance.   Appraisal took place in March 1981,
followed by a post-appraisal in July 1981.  The project was presented to
the Board on November 10, 1981 and, followiing Loan Agreement signature on
January 25, 1982, the Loan became effective on April 23, 1982. The project
was scheduled to be completed by September 1986 and the Closing Date was
March 31, 1987. The total estimated project cost of US$30.0 million equi-
valent was to be financed by a Bank Loan of US$20.5 million equivalent and
US$5.0 million equivalent of government funds. When it became clear that
the surplus funds arising from the strength of the US dollar would not be
used, the Bank cancelled US$8.5 million of the loan in December 1984. As
the project was practically completed by early 1987, there was no change in
the Closing Date, although the final disbursement was made on October 26,
1987, when an undisbursed balance of US$1.93 million was cancelled and the
loan account was closed.
Objectives and Proiect Content
2.       The project was designed to assist the Government in carrying out
its five year educational development prograr as set forth in the Fifth
National Development Plan (NDPV), 1979-1985. It consisted of the following
parts:
Part A: Primary Schools.   The construction, furnishing and equipping of
about 500 primary school classroioms and related facilities, including
offices, storerooms, cooking and ablution areas and staff houses.
Part B: Textbooks. The provision of about 200,000 primary school textbooks
and teachers' guides.
Part C:  Primary Teacher Training College (PTTC).   The construction,
furnishing and equipping of a PTTC in Tlokweng for about 300 student
places.



- iii -
Part D: Technical Assistance,   The strengthening of the Government's
project implementation capability through the provision of about 14 man-
years of specialist services consisting of (i) a project director/architect
(about five man-years) for the Project Implementation Unit (PIU); and (ii)
three accountancy specialists (about nine man-years) for the Ministry of
Local Government and Lands (MLGL).
Implementation Experience
3.       The PIU, originally established for the implementation of the
First Education Project, was responsible for the implementation of all MOE
projects and for liaison with the Bank. It was also responsible for coor-
dination with the various ministries and departments ix.volved in education
projects, including the Ministry of Local Government and Lands (MLGL) and
the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).   The PIU was adequately staffed and
performed well although cooperation was not optimal between the PIU and the
MLGL which was responsible for the primary school classroom constructiou.
Consequently, while civil works construction was generally ahead of sche-
dule, the procurement of furniture for the primary schools was delayed,
with the result that in m&ny classes children had to sit on the floor. An
important development during implementation was the 127 percent apprecia-
tion of the US dollar over the Pula between 1981 and 1985.   Government
request to use the surplus funds to build 250 more classrooms was turned
down by the Bank on grounds that the additions would widen the project
scope beyond the original intention. The project was practically completed
by early 1987.  Technical assistance, on the whole, was effec'.ively used.
Total project costs were Pula 19.78 million, about 16 percent lower tnan
the appraisal estimate of Pula 23.44 million.   In US dollars, the final
cost was estimated at about US$18.0 million which, however, needs to be
verified.
Results
4.       The project was successful in meeting its objective of providing
500 primary school classrooms whose geographical distribution has improved
educational opportunities for 20,000 children.   Equally important was the
construction of 237 housing units for teachers in areas where housing was
not available. The availability of housing has facilitated the posting of
teachers to schools. The provision of 1,400 toilet places has contributed
to better health conditions in the schools.   The distribution of 200,000
textbooks and teacher manuals has helped improve educational quality which
has also been reinforced by the establishment of a new primary teacher
training college (PTTC). Technical assistance was effective in strengthen-
ing project implementation, but it did not apparently contribute towards
building up the Government's implementation capability insofar as there was
no program to develop local staff to replace expatriazes.



- iv -
Sustainabilitv
5.       The classrooms were built in existing primary schools which are
likely to be sustained as long as the commitment remains strong at the
central and local government level to the provision of basic education. As
the same commitment extends to the provision of trained teachers, the new
PTTC is also likely to be sustained.  The sustainability of the textbook
scheme, however, will depend on the availability of recurrent funds from
the central government to augment the resources of the local authorities
who in turn will depend on parental support.   t. better assurance of
sustainability would be the establishment of an agency resp-nsible for the
physical as well as the qualitative aspects of textbook production/
procurement and distribution, with the financing responsibility vested in a
revolving fund, such as the institutional arrangement made under the
Lesotho Third Education Project (Credit 114P-LSO).
Findings and Lessons
6.       The project's quantitative objectives and a considerable part of
its qualitative objectives have been achieved.   The full impact of the
project, however, awaits later evaluation.   Evidently the implementation
capacity of the district councils, which were responsible for the primary
schools, was limited: building inspection in many districts proved to be
inadequate due to the lack of qualified inspectors and transportation.
Defaults of contractors occurred in most districts. The absence of major
problems during implementation was due largely to the relative simplicity
of the project, but the evident lack of flexibility in the Bank's inter-
pretation of project objectives prevented the Government from utilizing
project savings to provide more primary school classrooms.   From this
experience, the project suggests the following lessons:
(a) To improve school construction programs, a system of pre-
qualifying registered contractors should be set up;
(b) There should be an adequate number of trained inspectors to
strengthen the system of quality control in civil works construc-
tion for schools; and
(c) Flexibility should be incorporated into project design to permit
changes in project scope so long as they are consistent with
project objectives.

PART I:  PKmJECI MEVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.    Project Identity
Project Name:     Botswana Education III
Loan Number:      2057 BT
Country:          BOTSWANA, Republic of
Sector:           Education
Sub-Sector:       Primary Education and Teacher Training
Loan Amount:      USS 20 million
2.    Background
Sector Development Objectives
When the country became independant, education was not developed to a
point where it could make an adequate contribution to the national
development; principal weaknesses were (i) insufficient participation rate
in primary education, (ii) inadequacy of curricula, (iii) very limited
availability of secondary education, (iv) unavailability of employmenc
oriented/employment generating training, and (v) institutional weaknesses.
The sectoral objectives of a series of World Bank projects in education were
the elimination of these bottlenecks through appropriate project components.
The second education project concentrated on non-formal training, secondary
education, staff training for the public and private sector, and on
institution building. The third education project served the developmen.- of
primary education through school construction and teacher training.
Linkage with other Bank Projects in Education
The First Education Project was supporting the first phase of the
Government's educational investment plan, and aimed at increasing secondary
school enrolmeet as well as teacher training; Youth Brigades also were being
financed. The Second Project was a logical extension of the first one. It
became effective before the first project was completed. In a similar manner,
the third education project overlapped with the second one, so that continuity
was assured.
Since the inception of the Third Education Project which ran largely
parallel with the Second, a Fourth Education Project, again supporting
established Government policy in the field of education, is being implemented.
Linkages between Project, Sector and Macro-Economic Policy Objectives
Policy objective of the Government is the improvement of the living
standards of the popuiation at large.  As the availability of educational
opportunities is an integral factor of the living standard, education does not
fulfill a subservient role only in support of economic development, but rather
is an objective by itself.  Hence, teacher education plays an important role,
as it would facilitate generalization of educational cpportunities.  In a
similar way, improved primary education is important to avoid that education
become a dead end, leading nowhere.



-2-
3.    Rroelct Objectives and Description
Project Objectives
The principal project objective was to assist the Government in the
implementation of its education policy which established the expansion and
improvement of primary education as its first priority.  This objective would
be achieved through the construction of primary school classrooms for approx.
20,000 children (including furniture, equipment and textbookr), and the
establishment of a new primary teacher training college for a total of 300
student places.
Project Description
As financial and other constraints made attainment of universal primary
education impossible, the Government established the objective of providing
appropriace classroom facilities at 30 per cent of the assessed classroom
needs in all the nine districts. The 500 classrooms to be constructed under
the programme wk ld cover about 22 per cent of the Government's target for
1985.   The pro. ime of classroom construction would include ancillary
facilities (administrative blocks, ablution areas, staff housing).
The textbook component would consist of the delivery of about 200,000
textbooks and teachers' guides, and would thus extend beyond the schools to
be constructed; the existing procurement and distribution system would be
used.
The new primary teacher training center (Tlokweng PTTC) would be an
integral part of the Government's teacher training scheme, and the component
would consist of the construction of educational, administrative and other
facilities (incl. student accommodation and staff housing), so that the total
teacher training in the country could be brought to the required level. Also,
the PTTC would serve for in-service training of existing teachers.  New and
improved curricula would be introduced.
Technical assistance would be provided to enable the Boipelago (Self-
reliance) Education Project (BEPU), under the Ministry of Education and
established for the implementation of the First Education Project, to
administer the third education project in addition to the first and second
ones (an architect for five staff-years), and to the District Councils and the
Ministry of Local Government aid Lands (MLGL) to permit cost control,
accountancy and related bookkeeping (nine staff-years).   In addition, the
Government would continue to receive technical assistance, mainly from the
Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) in the field of primary
education.



:.    Proiect Desirn and Orgai ization
Conceptual Framework
As the project did not attempt to revamp the primary education delivery
system, but contented itself to provide more primary education facilities for
a type of education that was already being implemented (or experimenced with),
the conceptual framework of the project was unambiguously clear. Guidelines
had been mutually agreed upon which set forth criteria for selection of
existing schools for upgrading, for the location of new schools, and for
assistance to unaided primary schools; these criteria would ensuL equity of
distribution.
Innovations
The project was innovative only with regard to the introduction of
rational cr'.teria for the location of schools, and the assistance to un-aided
schools.   The desired modifications of the primary school curriculum had
already been decided upon by the Covermnent, and found agreeable to the Bank.
Realistically, the Bank did not attempt to push innovations any further, as
the problem of primary education was one of quantity, not one of quality (i.e.
more of the same, rather than a different type of primary education).
The textbook component would constitute a welcome 4improvement, though
not really an innovation.
Project Preparation
Project Preparation was done by the Government, in the same fashion as
the second education project had been prepared. Bank support in preparation
was provided through the regular supervision missions sent by the Bank.
Overall, project preparation was adequate.
Appropriateness of Timing
In view of the Governmeat's priority for primary education, it might be
considered that the project was overdue.   In this sense, the order of the
second and the third education projects might have been reversed. But, on the
other hand, it could also be reasoned that secondary education must preceed
as it provides for future teachers.  In terms of continuity of Government-
Bank cooperation in the field of education, the timing was appropriate.
Institutional Roles and Responsibilities
These were clear, as they were undertaken in continuation of the two
preceding projects. Roles and responsibilities were executed satisfactorily
as the staff in BEPU meanwhile had accumulated adequate experience.
Contributions co Project Success/Failure
The Project was a success in that it was fully implemented. It was a
failure inasmuch as a considerable portion of the original loan amount could
not be spent.   Contributing to the success/failure were macro-economic
developments beyond the control of both the Government and the World Bank.



5.    Project Im2lementation
Critical Variances between Projecr Design and Implementation
The Government desired that the unspent loan proceeds be utilized for
the construction of 250 additional classrooms for primary schools and related
facilities, but the request to this effect was not approved by the Bank on the
ground that projects objectives set at Lhe appraisal had been achieved and
that the facilities in question could be financed out of the fourth project.
Hence the critical variance: not with regard to the volume of facilities built
but with regard to the percentage (of the loan proceeds) spent.
A minor project variation concerned additional facilities for the PTTC
which were financed from savings.  But this additional programme constituted
a major improvement for the PTTC.
Another marginal variation concerned the use of loan procee-is for the
training of Government auditors. This was of only indirect importance for the
project. but a most welcome assistance for the Government and its functioning
overall.
Avoidability of Pro4ecc Variances
Bank policy in force at the time made it impossible for the Bank to heed
to the Government's request for the financing of an additional, construction
programme.   Seen in this light,  the variation in percentage of project
spending was unavoidable.
Calibration of Project Risks
"No major risks are foreseen"  (Appraisal report).   This statement
constituted an adequate calibration of project  risks  - except for the
variances in the exchange rate for the Pula to the US$.
Unforeseen Factors affecting Project Implementation
Mention must again be made of the exchange rate variations which were
not (and could not be) foreseen. Another factor of some importance was the
staffing problem of BEPU which has been mentioned in greater detail in the
completion report for the second education project. However, these problems
were resolved for the larger part of project implementation and had no lasting
effect.
6.    Project Results
As a result of the project, pupil places were constructed for about
20,000 primary school children, and the geographical distribution of
educational opportunities has become more even and equitable in the country;
before, primary schools were denser along the railway line than in the rest
of the country.
In respect of school hygiene, the construction of toilet facilities has
made a direct impact, but would in addition have a positive resilt owing to
the demonstration effect (- health education effect).



The provision of textbooks and teacher manuals marked a significant step
towards a quality improvement in primary education. No information exists
which would permit an assessment of the lasting effects of this intervention,
and of the Government's ability to maintain at a relatively high level the
provision of school textbooks.
The technical assistance component made it possible for BEPU to continue
with the exercise of its functions, and the auditor training generally
strengthened governmental auditing services.
The construction of the PTTC, finally, rounded off the Government's
dispositions for primary school teacher training at a qualitative and
quantitative level that must be consideLed adequate.
7..   Project Sustainability
A_ the project concerned "normal" educational activities whicth form part
of on-going primary school development in response to demands on che part of
the population, the project schools are being sustained as are other primarv
schools, and will continue to be sustained.
No detailed information is available relative to the sustainability of
the textbook scheme. Textbooks, of course, will be supplied in the future,
but possibly to a lesser extent, and/or with a greater financial contribution
of parents.
8.    Bank  EerforMAnce
!:ain Strength
The main strength of the Bank's performance lay in the close working
contacts maintained during project implementation; what has been said for the
second education project applies mutatis mutandis also for the third.
However, there appears to be a difference: As the project implementation had
become a routine operation and did not require as many on-the-spot decisions
as did the second education project, supervision missions became much less
frequent towards the end of the project cycle.
Performance during Identification/Preparation/Appraisal
For the main part, the project concerned straightforward primary
education.   For this reason, it could easily be integrated into routine
Government operations in the field ef education, and did not pose major
problems neither for preparation not for subsequent implementation. It would
seem that the Bank performed adequatelv in going along with the Government' s
wish to concentrate on primary education, without overloading the project with
relatively minor components (as was the case with the second education
project).



-6-
Performance during Supervision
As supervision missions, in particular the early ones, were charged with
supervising all education projects going on at that time, it is not possible
to determine the amount of supervision devoted specifically to the third
education  project.    When  there  was  only  one  education project  left,
superv4.Lon missions became less frequent.
Main Lessons
The Bank performed adequately during project implementation. However,
the decision by the Bank to disapprove a Government request to use unspent
funds for an extension of the primary school construction programme led to a
cooling down in Government-Bank relations. While the decision by the Bank was
warranted in the light of an established policy, it may yet be asked whether
indeed much was gained (for both the Bank and the Government) through this
insistance on principles. A somewhat greater flexibility on the part of the
Bank might have been fruitful for the project to follow in the future.
9.    Borrower Performance
Main Strengths and Weaknesses
Owing to the straightforward, unambiguous character of the project, no
major weaknesses on the part of the borrower became apparent; even the initial
delays in project implementation cannot be called "weaknesses".  It is, of
course, a mute question whether the project was smoothly implemented because
of the strengths of the borrower, or whether this was a consequence of a
project design that resulted in what may be called a high degree of
"implementability".
Performance during Preparation and Implementation
Borrower performance during these phases of the project cycle was
commensurate with the characteristics of the project, and thus adequate.
Staffing problems in BEPU which had some effect on project implementation for
the second education project were almost resolved in time for the
implementation of the third project.
The officer of the Ministry of Local Governments and Lands (MLGL) in
charge of procurement of furniture had been temporarily located physically
at BEPU to benefit directly of the experience acquired by the latter for
procurement. However, some delays occurred in the procurement of furniture
preventing the schools to be opened to children once the building works were
completed. To accelerate its delivery, procurement was then obtained by means
of extended orders to the suppliers who were successful tenderers in the first
phase of this procurement.



-7-
Main Lessons
District Councils' implementation capacity were limited, building
inspection in many districts provad to be inadequate due to lack of qualified
officers and transport. Defaults of contracts occurred in most districts.
A system of more continuous control of buildings work was implemented for the
future projects and inspectors are still being given training.   To reduce
defaults on contracts, it was recommended that a system of pre-qualification
of registration if contractors be set up.
With regard to "Lessons to be learned" two issues might be considered.
(i) It would appear to be a sound policy if education projects were (as this
was the case here) designed more und4r the aspect of easy implewentability
than with the ambition to revamp, moderiaze or innovate existing systems.
(.ii) It seems that frictions between the Government and the Bank wlhich
resulted from the Bank decision not to grant the uti:ization of unspent funds,
might have been avoided in the interest of the continuity of fruitful and
harmonious working relations between the two partners.
10.   Proiect Relationships
As mentioned above, frictions arose as a consequence of the changes in
the US$ purchasing power. It cannot be said with certainty whether the long
time lapse between the third and the fourth education projects (almost four

6.    Project Results
A. Quantitative Results
No detailed information is available relative to the enrolment in the
project schools.   This information would be difficult to establish since
there were  not cnly new schools  but  a considerable  number  of  school
extensions.   With the 500 classrooms built up, it can be estimated that
additional pupil places were created for 20,000 children.
Even more important might be the construction of over 237 teacher
houses . as teachers would be sent to locations in which no teachers
previously could be supplied due to housing shortage.
B. Qualitative Results
The impact of the introduction of improved curricula cannot be
measured but It should be important as it guides pupils away from the
previous preponderance of "academic" studies.
The provision of textbooks for pupils and teachers and the
construction of some 1,400 toilet places are important qualitative aspects
o£ the project.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT
Overall
1.   Because  of  favourable  exchange  rate  variations  and
reasonably efficient management, the Project experienced a
substantial cost underrun in US dollar terms.  This not only
resulted in funding of additional facilities for the PTTC, but
also produced savings of about respectively US$8.5 and US$1.9
million which were cancelled on termination.
Proiect Costs Performance
2.   The total estimated cost of the Project at Signature was
Pula 23.44 million, equivalent to US$30.0 million at the
exchange rate prevailing in April 1980, including' US$0.8 of
taxes.  The Bank financing of US$20 million equivalent was to
cove- 68 per cent of the total project cost.  At the time of
the completion mission, the total project cost was estimated to
be Pula 10.10, or US$14.44 equivalent. Because of a favourable
exchange rate and reasonably efficient management, the project
experienced a substantial cost underrun in USS terms.   The
Project cost in terms of US$ is largely inferior (52 per cent
underrun) to the appraisal cost estimate. Detailed comparisons
of Appraisal estimates and actual costs by component are given
pp. 11 and 12.
3.   Apart from the Textbook category which was overdrawn by
about 36 per cent in US$ terms, every other category was
substantially underutilized.
4.   The actual cost of Civil Works exeuted for the Primary
School classrooms (construction materials and labour) amounted
to 59.3 per cent of the total project and were 33 per cent
above appraisal estimates  in US$ terms.   The savings were
mainly due to the favourable US$ to Pula exchange rate.
5.   The actual cost of Civil Wo=  executed for the Tlokweng
Primary Teacher Training Center amounted to 23.7 per cent of
the total project cost and were 14 per cent above appraisal
estimates in USS terms.   As for the above, the savings were
mainly due to the favourable US$ to Pula exchange rate.
6.   The actual Furniture and Eauient component for Primary
Schools and Tlokweng PTTC total costs were respectively USS.95
and US$.18 million, compared to US$2.19 and .44 million
estimated at appraisal.   It represents respectively 6.6 per
cent and 1.2 per cent of the total cost, about 60 per cent less
than estimated.

Annex
Page 2 of 3
7.   The  Textbook  component  total  actual  cost  was  US$.68
million, representing 4.7 per cent of the total project cost
instead  of  the  estimated  1.6  per  cent;    the  component
calculated in US$ terms was about 36 per cent more than
estimated.
8.   The  Proiect  Imglementation  Unit  Technit  Assistance
category provided for project administration amounted to 1 per
cent of the total project cost and had a cost underrun of 76
per cent in terms of US$.
9.   The total cost of the Professional fees amounted to US$.49
million equivalent to 3.4 per cent of the total project cost
and had a cost underrun of 23 per cent in US$ terms.
Financing and Disbursement of Credit Proceeds
10. The Loan of US$ 20 million represented 68 per cent of the
total project cost net of taxes.  The table of page 12 gives a
comparison of estimated and actual financing of the project.
11. In general, disbursement of Loan proceeds was much slcwer
than estimated at appraisal.   This was partly due to a late
start in expenditure, with the first application dated 19 May
1983, almost thirteen months after the Loan became effective.
Also, there were considerable reductions in the Loan amount so
that the total sum disbursed is hardly equal to 50 per cent of
the agreed loan amount.  A third reason for slow disbursement
was the relative stagnation in project implementation,
resulting from the local government difficulties to implement
the Primary School classroors componenet as well as due to
staffing difficulties in the Project unit in 1984.
12. As must be expected, there was a marked difference in
disbursement  for  the  different  categories.    The  bulk  of
disbursements for civil works/primary schools was in 1983
through 1984. The same was the case for the PTTC, except that
in 1986 disbursements for the additional construction programme
took place. The disbursements for furniture, on the one hand,
started for the primary schools only in 1986, when the date of
Project closing was approaching, furniture disbursement for the
PTTC, on the other hand, came earlier on in the project cycle.
For textbooks, there were only two lumps of disbursements, in
1984/85 and in 1986/87. Disbursement for technical assistance
was also rather uneven (see Table on Disbursement by Component
next page).
