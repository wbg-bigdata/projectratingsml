SHANGHAI WAIGAOQIAO PHASE II POWER PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
INTRODUCTION
NEED FOR THE PROJECT
China is currently the world's second largest producer of electricity, its installed capacity having
grown at an annual average rate of 8 percent between 1983 and 1994. The Shanghai Electric
Power Grid (SEPG) is an important part of the East China Grid which covers the provinces of
Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang and the Shanghai Municipality. Greater Shanghai is one of the
main load centers of the East China Grid and is served by the Shanghai Municipal Electric Power
Company (SMEPC). Shanghai, as the largest city and economic center in-China, will continue to
experience electric growth. By the year 2000, the maximum load is expected to reach 11,600
MW, an annual average load growth of over II percent. By 2002, the maximum load is expected
to be 13,750 MW. With planned additions through 2000, the maximum capacity will be
12,277 MW. To meet power demnands, SMEPC plans to add approximately 1,800 to 2,000
megawatts (MW) of generating capacity at the Waigaoqiao Power Plant as part of the second
phase of development. Located in the Pudong New Area, 20 kilometers (kIn) from the city
center, the Waigaoqiao facility has been planned in three phases (see Figure 1). Following the
completion of the first phase of the Waigaoqiao Power Plant (four 300-MW units) in 1997,
SMEPC plans to initiate the second phase of development of the site through the construction of
two coal-fired supercritical units of 900 to 1,000 MW each, followed by a third and final phase of
installation of another 1,800 to 2,000 MW for a total site development of about 5,200 MW. The
capital cost for the Phase II project is estimated to be about $US 2 billion with funds from a
World Bank loan, SMEPC, East China Electric Power Company, Shen Neng Electric Power
Development Investment Company, local banks, and cofinancing.
ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS
The World Bank has established guidelines for ensuring that borrowers have adequately
characterized the environmental impacts of proposed actions, considered alternatives to a proposed
project, developed measures that would mitigate unavoidable impacts, and identified training and
monitoring requirements to assure implementation of those measures. Environmental assessment
(EA) guidelines for the World Bank provide general guidance in the preparation of EA reports

and are supported by supplementary guidelines that address requirements for thermoelectric
projects. Finally, Operational Policy Notes (OPN) assure treatment of topics of particular
importance to the Bank, including possible impacts to biodiversity, indigenous peoples, wildlands,
and wetlands.
In the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), the Thermal Power Plant Project Preparatory Stage
Environmental Protection Regulation (MOE, 1989) promulgated by the Ministry of Energy
(MOE) requires an EA during the feasibility study stage of project development. For projects
with an investment potential in excess of 200 million yuan (RMB), the EA should be submitted to
MOE by the main administrative unit of the project. In the case of the Waigaoqiao Power Plant,
this administrative unit is SMEPC. After previewing the document, MOE submits the EA to the
national Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for approval.
The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Environmental Protection (SMBEP) is primnarily responsible
for overseeing the environmental quality of the greater Shanghai area. While SMBEP develops
policies and programs aimed at decreasing levels of pollutants from a variety of sources, the
organization defers to the PRC National Environmental Quality Standards for numerical guidance
related to emissions and effluent as well as ambient conditions. SMBEP has primary
responsibility for monitoring industries for compliance with these standards.
Feasibility studies were carried out by the Beijing Economic Research Institute while technical
designs and environmental impact assessments were conducted by the East China Electric Power
Design Institute (ECEPDI). As result, a draft EA report has been prepared by ECEPDI and
submitted to the World Bank. As a supplement to the ECEPDI draft EA report, this EA was
prepared in collaboration with ECEPDI to address further the impacts of the proposed project,
particularly as they relate to current and future power production at the Waigaoqiao facility.
PROJECT DESCRIPIION
PROJECT SCHEDULE
The Waigaoqiao Phase II Power Plant project is an integral expansion of the Waigaoqiao Power
Plant site. Construction for the four 300-MW Phase I units was initiated on November 25, 1992,
with completion of all units expected by 1997. Units I and 2 of the Phase I project were in
commercial operation at the end of 1994 and 1995, respectively. The Phase II project will consist
ES-3



9651118C/ES-4
5/30/97
of two 1,000-MW (nominal) units that will be in commercial operation in 2002. The planning of
the site also incorporated the addition of Phase m, which is expected to be simnilar in capacity as
Phase II, i.e., two 1,000-MW (nominal) units.
PLANT SITE
The area designated for power plant development for all phases is 144.4 hectares (ha); Phase II
will occupy about 46 ha. To provide construction laydown for Phase II and site and construction
laydown areas for Phase m, agricultural and residential areas adjacent to Phase I will be
dedicated to the power plant. About 1,000 people currently using this land will be relocated.
FUEL
The fuel for all phases of the Waigaoqiao Power Plant will be bituminous coal from the Shenfu-
Dongshen mining area located in the middle of Inner Mongolia. Coal will be transported by rail
to a coastal port and then shipped to the Waigaoqiao Plant site in 35,000-ton shallow-draft coal
ships. The coal pier constructed for Phase I can handle docking of two coal ships. A separate
pier is planned for Phase II and will have a similar design as the Phase I pier. For Phase III, the
Phase II coal pier will be used.
WATER SUPPLY
The Yangtze River is the principal source of cooling and service water for all phases of the
Waigaoqiao Power Plant. The major use of water is for once-through condenser cooling. Phase I
will ultimately use 45.3 cubic meters per second (m3/s) of Yangtze River water for condenser
cooling Phases II and III will each utilize 74.2 m31s for condenser cooling during the summer.
The intake and discharge designs for all phases are similar. Service water is used for the steam
cycle, ash sluicing, and other plant uses. Yangtze River water used for boiler service is treated
using clarification-sedimentation, reverse osmosis (RO), and mixed-bed resin demineralization.
City water will be used for all potable water purposes. Wastewater generated for all phases will
consist of boiler treatment regeneration wastewater (RO and demineralizer backwash), boiler
cleaning, wash water, contact and non-contact rainfall runoff, excess bottom ash water, and
sanitary sewage. The industrial wastewater is treated using neutralization and sedimentation.
Any potential oil-contaminated wastewater is treated in an oil separator prior to discharge.
Sewage wastewater is treated using biological treatment (aeration) and chlorination. The
ES-4



9651118C/ES-S
5/30/97
wastewater for all phases is discharged to the once-through discharge system and the Yangtze
River.
BYPRODUCTS
The byproducts from all phases of the Waigaoqiao Power Project primnarily consist of bottom ash
(boiler slag) and fly ash. The bottom ash is sluiced from the boiler to a dewatering area. The
bottom ash for all phases will be stored (or disposed) adjacent to the Yangtze River in an area of
about 1.2 million m2. A bottom ash (slag) area has been constructed for Phase I and will be used
for all phases depending on ash reuse.
Fly ash will be transported from a separate ash pier and to ash barges. The barges will be
transported to the Limin Ash Yard, which is located about 14 km downstream from the plant site.
An area of 1.2 million m`2 has been constructed for Phase I and will be used for the other phases
depending on ash reuse. The storage/disposal area for the fly ash has been constructed in the
littoral area of the Yangtze River, about 800 m into the river and 1,000 m along the shoreline. A
concrete outer berm separates the storage/disposal area from the river. The area just north of the
ash storage/disposal area is being used for disposal of Haungpu River sediments which will be
used by the Pudong New Area Municipality. If required for Phase II, the Phase I ash yard will
be extended downstream.
The ash characteristics for the Shenfu-Dongshen coal are a favorable quality for reuse in the
construction industry. Currently all the ash generated from Phase I Units 1 and 2 is provided at
nominal cost to the construction industry. Some bottom ash has been stored/disposed of in the
bottom ash area, but it is largely open; the Limin Ash Yard has not been used.
AIR EMISSIONS
The air emissions from the combustion of coal for all phases of the Waigaoqiao Power Plant will
be controlled using low-sulfur (0.43 percent) coal to limit emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2),
electrostatic precipitators (ESP) to limit emissions of particulate matter (PM), and boiler design
and low-NO, combustors to limit emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO). An additional benefit of
using Shenfu-Dongshen coal is the SO2 removal obtained from the high calcium content which
studies using this coal in a similar unit has demonstrated an average SO2 removal of about 14
percent.
ES-5



9651118CIES-6
5/30/97
With the implementation of Phase I, the Shanghai Municipal Government has implemented a
requirement to install FGD systems for SO2 removal. The use of low-sulfur content Shenfu-
Dongshen coal obviates the technical need to install FGD systems on Phase II units to meet air
quality and emissions standards. The use of FGD would be costly for the planned 1,000 MW
units and not necessary from an air quality perspective. Instead of installing FGD on Phase II
units, SMEPC has requested and obtained approval from the Shanghai Municipality to offset the
SO2 emissions from Phase II by installing FGD on two 300-MW (nominal) units using 1.8 percent
sulfur coal at another power plant, i.e., the Sidongkou Power Plant. Fugitive dust that may be
generated from the coal and ash handling systems will be controlled for all phases using
enclosures, air pollution control devices, and watering. All phases of the Waigaoqiao Power Plant
will meet or be lower than the World Bank, PRC, and Shanghai emissions guidelines and
standards.
TRANSMISSION LINES
A 500-kV system will interconnect Phase II and Phase III with the SMEPC electric system.
Currently, the electric power from Phase I is transmitted through a 230-kV system. The location
for the 500-kV system has been under development since 1983 and confirmed in 1993 by the
Shanghai Municipal government. The siting was coordinated with the Pudang New Area planning
subdivision and other municipal agencies. Once the corridor is identified, construction will be
controlled by the municipal government. The current land use of the line is open land or
agricultural; any small buildings would be removed with resettlement under the Shanghai
Municipal Resettlement Bureau.
AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT
AIR QUALITY
The City of Shanghai, like all major industrialized urban areas, has many anthropogenetic sources
of air pollution which have increased during the past decade due to growth. The SMBEP has
monitored the ambient air quality that include parameters relevant to the Waigaoqiao Power
Project: sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO,), and total suspended particulates (TSP).
The monitoring data collected by SMBEP indicate that the ambient air quality standards for TSP
are exceeded at all stations. The maximum daily TSP concentrations measured routinely exceeded
both the World Bank 1988 guidelines and PRC Class II standards for particulates, which are
0.500 milligram per cubic meter (mg/im3) and 0.300 mg/m3, respectively. The source of the high
ES-6



9651118C/ES-7
5/30/97
TSP concentrations are the result of the construction and industrial activities. The Shanghai
Municipal Government has implemented plans for reducing the high TSP concentrations in the
city.
The maximum daily (24-hour) background SO2 concentrations in the area that would be impacted
by emissions from the Waigaoqiao Power Plant are generally below both the World Bank and
PRC Class 11 ambient air quality standards of 0.500 mg/m3 and 0.150 mg/rn3, respectively, for
the maximum 24-hour and annual averaging times. The SO2 concentrations observed in central
Shanghai and at Waigaoqiao exceed the PRC Class II guideline for the maximum 24-hour
averaging times.
The observed air quality for NO, is below the SMBEP and World Bank guidelines with the
exception of several instances where the maximum 24-hour concentration is marginally above the
SMBEP standard of 0.150 mg/Nm3. The annual NO, concentration in the area is below the
SMBEP and the World Bank guidelines.
The observed noise levels comply with the World Bank guidelines and the Shanghai Class HI and
IV noise standards.
WATER QUANTITY AND QUALITY
The Yangtze River, also known as the Changjiang River, is the largest river system in China.
The annual average discharge of the Yangtze River is about 30,200 m3/sec. The Yangtze River
has been heavily degraded in recent decades, chiefly due to contamination from industrial wastes,
ship-borne wastes, untreated municipal sewage, stormwater runoff, and vastly increased sediment
loads due to upstream deforestation.
SITE CHARACTERISTICS
The site for the Phase II expansion of the Waigaoqiao Power Plant including coal pile expansion
is located on land which has been previously cleared and impacted and used by small businesses,
industry, and agriculture practices. The Limin Ash Yard has vegetation characteristic of weedy,
open, previously cleared land The area is being used by local farmers to harvest shrimp and
cattle grazing. No unusual plants or those considered rare by the International Union for
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources are in evidence at the plant site or ash yard.
ES-7



9651118C/ES-8
5/30/97
The land allocated for the three phases of the Waigaoqiao facility at one time represented a
combination of industrial, agricultural, and residential land uses. SMEPC has been allocated the
land required for the three phases of the Waigaoqiao facility and its ancillary facilities such as the
transmission line.
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
AIR RESOURCES
The air quality impacts of Phases I and II and Phases I, II and Im, without concentrations from
other sources, are below the Shanghai Ambient Air Quality Standards (AAQS) and the World
Bank guidelines. When other sources are considered, the annual average impacts for SO2 are less
than the Shanghai AAQS, but the 24-hour impacts are predicted to be slightly higher than the
AAQS. However, this assumes that the maximum impacts from other sources occur at the same
time as Waigaoqiao, an unlikely result.. The S02 impacts are predicted to be less than the
currently applicable World Bank guidelines. The maximum impacts for inhalable particulates are
predicted to be above the Shanghai AAQS; the impacts would also be above the currently
applicable World Bank guidelines. The existing high particulate load of the Shanghai area is the
primary cause of the predicted exceedances. The maximum impacts due to the plant are small
when compared to the Shanghai AAQS. The maximum annual impacts of NO2 are predicted to
be less than the Shanghai AAQS and the World Bank guidelines.
The installation of FGD on Sidongkou Plant 1, Stack No. 1, results in a substantial decrease in
regional SO2 emissions and a decrease in annual and 24-hour concentrations around the Sidongkou
Plant and in Central Shanghai. The emissions reduction from Sidongkou Plant Units 1 and 2 is
expected to be about 48,000 tons per year. In contrast, the SO2 emissions from Waigaoqiao
Phase II will be about 37,000 tons per year. Therefore, a net reduction of over 10,000 tons/year
SO2 will result with the proposed strategy. For air quality, the decrease in 24-hour concentrations
in the Sidongkou area is almost double the increase in the Waigaoqiao area. An increase in air
quality concentrations occurs in the Waigaoqiao area due to the proximity of the plant and the
distance of the Sidongkou plant from Waigaoqiao. However, there is a decrease in the maximum
concentrations in Central Shanghai where the air quality is much poorer In the Central Shanghai
area, both the annual and 24-hour maximum concentrations due to Sidongkou and Waigaoqiao are
predicted to decrease. The 24-hour maximum concentrations from both plants would decrease by
about 70 percent while the annual average would decrease by about 40 percent. An added benefit
ES-8



9651118C/ES-9
5/30/97
of the FGD system is the reduction of particulate emissions which is estimated to be about 1,600
tons/year.
The predicted noise levels are within the World Bank guidelines and Shanghai Class III daytimne
standards for industrial land use areas. Impacts to commercial and residential areas will not
occur. The Shanghai Class III and Class IV nighttime noise standards of 55 dBA may be exceeded
at both the eastern and southern boundaries of the plant site, but the adjacent land uses are
industrial with no residential areas nearby. Based on these results, no significant impact to public
health and welfare from noise levels is predicted.
Recommendations
IUtilize low-sulfur (0.43 percent) coal in Phase II and III in conjunction with FGD on
Sidongkou Plant 1.
v    Reduce particulate emissions rate to 100 mg/m3.
*     JUtilize low-NO, burners to reduce NOQ emission rate to World Bank guidelines.
*    Continue to monitor air quality in vicinity of power plants.
*    Continue control practices (e.g., watering) for fugitive dust emissions.
WATER RESOURCES
The volume of flow in the Yangtze River at Waigaoqiao is sufficient to accomnnodate once-
through cooling. Service water will also be obtained from the Yangtze River. The water will be
pretreated using chemical clarification, settling, and reverse osmosis. Boiler feedwater will be
demineralized. The water treatment has been designed to reduce water use and wastewater
discharges by recycling some process wastewater streams. The wastewater treatment and
discharge system has been designed for the Waigaoqiao Phase II power project to minimize
impacts. The treatment system will handle all water treatment wastes through neutralization and
sedimentation. Potentially oily wastes generated in equipment washing operations will go through
oil water separators. Water used for bottom ash will be recycled.
The World Bank Guidelines for thermal discharges may be exceed in areas around the discharge.
The maximum impacts under low flow conditions will be 33 hectares for Phases I and II and 72
ES-9



9651118CIES-10
5/30197
hectares for all phases. Under normal flow conditions the impacted area will be less than 7.5
hectares.
Recommendations:
*    Utilize Yangtze River for once-through condenser cooling and service water.
*    Recycle lower quality water for ash handling and dust suppression.
*    Install and operate water treatment systems
ECOLOGICAL RESOURCES
The impact of constructing Phase II and Phase m of the Waigaoqiao Power Plant is expected to
be minimal on the ecology, since the area has been impacted previously, and no significant
habitats exist. The major potential impact for the bottom ash area is the removal of the
introduced agricultural and wetland area created from the Yangtze River. This habitat provides
locally useful grazing area and shrimp harvesting for local farrners. Use of the area for bottom
ash disposal would prohibit these alternative uses. To assure the reuse of ash, SMEPC should
develop a management plan for ash reuse and have dedicated staff to implement the reuse plan.
Where possible, alternate uses should be developed (e.g., as a road base aggregate) for potential
future plans. The economics favor reuse which avoids disposal costs such as land acquisition, ash
yard construction, handling, and transportation.
The intake and discharge of cooling water from the Yangtze River may have some impact on
local fishery productivity since the area is estuarine and hence a nursery zone for early life stages.
However, the temperature differences are not great and tidal and current velocities are such that
any exposure will be transitory and not significant. There are no benthic communities of
significance (i.e., sessile communities), so overall impacts are expected to be minimal. The free
residual chlorine of the cooling water discharge will be kept to 0.1 ppm or less which is below
the World Bank guideline of 0.2 ppm.
Recommendations:
*    Develop an ash reuse plan to mitigate use of ash disposal areas.
*    Limit and monitor chlorine usage for once-through cooling system.

9651118C/ES-11
5130/97
SOCIOCULTURAL RESOURCES
Currently, 1,000 residents from Jiang Zhang Zhai, the nearest village, reside on portions of the
land allocated for Phase II at Waigaoqiao and will need to be relocated to secure the land for the
subsequent phases of the project. A resettlement plan is being developed by SMEPC in
cooperation with World Bank consultants. Moreover, villagers are eager to move to the newly
constructed housing units since they offer the advantages of indoor plumbing, contained sewage
disposal, and a steady electricity source. In addition, the PRC and Shanghai governments require
that all displaced persons be placed in gainfully employment and trained for these positions if
necessary. SMEPC has committed to carrying out this requirement for all displaced persons.
The power plant will employ 2,500 workers at its peak during construction. The workers will
come from the greater Shanghai area.  During operation, the facility will require a work force
of about 800 skilled and unskilled labor. Similarly, these workers will reside in the greater
Shanghai area, as well as specifically in the Pudong New Area. Therefore, there will be no need
to construct worker colonies for either the construction or operational labor force.
The aligrunent for the additional 50 kan transmission line has been secured by the Department of
Roads and is currently unoccupied. The alignment for the transmission line, which has been
developing for 11 years, follows a major highway for a significant portion of the route. Criteria
for siting the remainder of the route included measures to avoid towns and existing buildings and
collocating with existing linear facilities. No resettlement will be required for the construction of
the additional 500-kV transmission line.
Recommendations:
*    Implement resettlement program as prescribed by Shanghai Municipal Government.
MONITORING PROGRAMS
SMEPC has incorporated a comprehensive monitoring program for Phase I of the Waigaoqiao
Power Project which will continue for Phases n and III. The program includes elements to
measure the air, noise, water, ash, and occupational conditions. Initially, monitoring will be
conducted to determine conformance with manufacturers' guarantees. The methods for
determining contract conformance will be specified prior to their use and be based on
methodologies recognized as valid and appropriate to measure environmental emissions and
ES-11



9651118C/ES-12
5/30/97
discharges. Additionally, the potential exceedance of the World Bank thermal guideline during
certain times suggest the need for thermal monitoring not currently performed. The monitoring
programs recommended for Phases II and III are listed below.
Recommendations:
*    Continue monitoring of stack emissions and fugitive dust emissions for plant equipment.
*    Continue to support SMBEP efforts to monitor ambient air quality in the vicinity to the
power plants (Waigaoqiao and Sidongkou).
*    Continue water intake quantity and quality monitoring of the Yangtze River water.
*    Continue monitoring of water discharge quality for parameters relevant to the discharge
characteristics and include total suspended and dissolved solids (TSS and TDS), pH, oil and
grease, and chlorine residual.
*    Continue noise monitoring on a quarterly within and outside the plant a various locations.
*    Continue occupational training that is conducted on a regular basis with an established
program.
*    Develop and Implement an ecological monitoring program to assess thermal impacts. Any
significant thermal effects determined during Phase II would be the basis for mitigation
developed during Phase IIl development.
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
The Waigaoqiao Power Project has been under planning and development for more than 10 years
with communications and input that involve various agencies of the Shanghai Municipal
govermnent and Central governnent. Various stakeholders in the projects development and those
that may be directly affected include: Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Enviromnental Protection,
Shanghai City Planning Administration, Shanghai Municipal Real Estate Bureau, Shanghai
Municipal Housing and Land Administration, Pudong New Area administration and village team
leaders. On December 9, 1996 a public meeting was held at the Waigaoqiao Power Plant to
discuss projects environmental impacts with the stakeholders. Representatives for SMEPC,
SMBEP and ECEPDI presented a description of the Phase II project, its environmental impacts
and mitigation, and the monitoring programs. About 40 representatives attended the meeting with
nearby village team representative in attendance.

1.0 BACKGROUND
China is currently the world's second largest producer of electricity, its installed capacity having
grown at an annual average rate of 8 percent between 1983 and 1994. Nevertheless, China's
economic development continues to be restrained by electricity shortages, and Government plans
indicate that generating capacity must increase by 17 to 20 gigawatts (GW) per year for the next
5 years to prevent more acute shortages. The Shanghai Electric Power Grid (SEPG) is an
important part of the East China Grid which covers the provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang
and the Shanghai Municipality. Greater Shanghai is one of the main load centers of the East
China Grid and is served by the Shanghai Municipal Electric Power Company (SMEPC).
The primary objectives of this project are to:
i.  Increase electricity supply to reduce the acute power shortages in Shanghai through
development of two large coal-fired thermal units based on the most advanced
technology;
2.  Develop a program to apply for the first time in China the 'bubble concept' for cost-
effective air quality management within Shanghai Municipality;
3.  Support the ongoing power sector reform by restructuring SMEPC in line with the
power sector reform strategy, encouraging private sector involvement through listing
of the generation company, and rationalizing the tariff structure as well as adjusting
the tariff level to accommodate the stricter sulfur dioxide emission standards; and
4. Promote an innovative and diversified financing model for a large infrastructure
project and improve the access of power entities to international financial markets.
To achieve these goals, SMEPC plans to add approximately 1,800 to 2,000 megawatts (MW) of
generating capacity at the Waigaoqiao Power Plant as part of the second phase of development.
Located in the Pudong New Area, 20 kilometers (km) from the city center, the Waigaoqiao
facility has been planned in three phases. Following the completion of the first phase of the
Waigaoqiao Power Plant (four 300-MW units) in 1997, SMEPC plans to initiate the second phase
of development of the site through the construction of two coal-fired supercritical units of 900 to
1,000 MW each, followed by a third and final phase of installation of another 1.800 to
2,000 MW.

The capital cost for the Phase II project is estimated to be about $US 2 billion with funds from a
World Bank loan, SMEPC, East China Electric Power Company, Shen Neng Electric Power
Development Investment Company, local banks, and cofinancing.
The generating units of the proposed project will be designed to burn good-quality coal produced
at the Shenfu and Dongsheng mines in Shanxi Province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
The plant will be connected to the SEPG through a 500-kilovolt (kV) transmission system.
SMEPC has primary responsibility for the project. Feasibility studies were carried out by the
Beijing Economic Research Institute while technical designs and environmental impact
assessments were conducted by the East China Electric Power Design Institute (ECEPDI). As
result, a draft Enviromnental Assessment (EA) report has been prepared by ECEPDI and
submitted to the World Bank. This report was prepared in collaboration with ECEPDI to address
further the impacts of the proposed project, particularly as they relate to current and future power
production at the Waigaoqiao facility.
Much of the information in this EA is based on the ECEPDI technical feasibility and
environmental assessment which includes conceptual design information. Final design information
including process flows will be developed after the international bidding process is completed for
the importation of the super-critical units proposed for Phase II. Process flows will be developed
for all mechanical, electrical, civil and environmental systems
1.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT (EA) MISSION
1.1.1 WORLD BANK TREATMENT OF THERMAL POWER DEVELOPMENT
The World Bank has established guidelines for ensuring that borrowers have adequately
characterized the environmental impacts of proposed actions, considered alternatives to a proposed
project, developed measures that would mitigate unavoidable impacts, and identified training and
monitoring requirements to assure implementation of those measures. Environmental assessment
(EA) guidelines for the World Bank are specified in the World Bank Operational Directive (OD)
4:01 (1991); which provides general guidance in the preparation of EA reports. Via the
Sourcebook series (1990), OD 4:01 is supported by supplementary guidelines that address sector
specific issues. Specific environmental assessment guidelines exist for thermoelectric projects.
1-2



9651118C/1-3
S/28197
Finally, Operational Policy Notes (OPN) assure treatment of topics of particular importance to the
Bank; including possible impacts to biodiversity, indigenous peoples, wildlands, and wetlands.
During the identification phase, the World Bank screens projects with regard to their potential for
causing adverse enviromnental impacts, assigning the projects to one of three categories: A, B,
or C. Phase II of the Waigaoqiao Power Plant project, like virtually all thermal power projects,
was rated as Category A, meaning that significant potential exists for adverse environmental
impacts and that an EA must always be performed.
1.1.2 EA BY THE EAST CHINA ELECTRIC POWER DESIGN INSTITUTE (ECEPDI)
AND KBN ENGINEERING AND APPLIED SCIENCES, INC. (KBN)
The design of thermal power plants and associated facilities is the primary function of ECEPDI, a
public organization located in Shanghai that provides technical assistance services to utilities.
ECEPDI prepared an EA for the development of the Waigaoqiao Power Plant. World Bank
review of the project regarding potential environmental issues led to the involvement of KBN
Engineering and Applied Sciences, Inc. (KBN) in October 1996. Through KBN collaboration
with SMEPC and ECEPDI, the World Bank desires information that:
1.  Potential impacts from atmospheric pollution of all phases of the project are
adequately assessed and mitigated,
2.  Thermal impacts associated with proposed effluent discharge are adequately
represented,
3.  Fly ash waste disposal issues are adequately addressed,
4.  Adequate public participation is sought, and
5.  The OPN special topics are addressed.
The objective for KBN's participation was to provide assistance to SMEPC and ECEPDI in the
preparation of a final EA report that addresses these areas of particular World Bank interest and
allows the timely execution of the Appraisal Mission.
A three-person team of KBN scientists traveled to Shanghai in October-November 1996, visiting
the Waigaoqiao site and surrounding areas, interviewing local officials and residents, and
identifying additional data through a series of working meetings with SMEPC and ECEPDI staff.

9651118CI1-4
5/28/97
The 1996 EA document (ECEPDI, 1996) and information obtained from SMEPC and ECEPDI
were used by the KBN team as an information reference during EA preparation.
1.1.3 WAIGAOQIAO POWER PLANT GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE
The potential area of environmental impact is determined by the aggregate scope of construction
and operational impacts.
Construction Imnacts
Construction impacts are derived principally from the occupation and alteration of land for power
plant infrastructure, including the switchyard, power block, coal handling facilities, ash storage
and disposal facilities, and water resource infrastructure. Additional impacts to local populations
can be anticipated in the form of increased road and ship traffic, as well as from the influx of
temporary labor.
Operationa) ImRacts
Operational impacts for thermal power projects can be derived from the discharge of atmospheric
and aquatic pollutants, withdrawal of water from surface and underground sources, and the
generation of other waste streams. These impacts were considered within a range of 15 to 25 Iam
surrounding the power plant site.
1.2 ENVIRONMENTAL, LEGAL, AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR PROJECT
DEVELOPMENT
1.2.1 PRC LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
1.2.1.1 PRC Laws
The principal laws and regulations related to environmental impacts of thermal power plants in
China are provided in Table 1.2-1. According to the Thermal Power Plant Project Preparatory
Stage Environmental Protection Regulation (MOE, 1989) promulgated by the Ministry of Energy
(MOE), an EA is required during the feasibility study stage of project development. For projects
with an investment potential in excess of 200 million yuan (RMB), the EA should be submitted to
MOEP by the main administrative unit of the project. In the case of the Waigaoqiao Power Plant,
this administrative unit is SMEPC. After previewing the document, MOEP submits the EA to the
national Enviromnental Protection Agency (EPA) for approval.
1-4



9651118C/1-5
5/28/97
The appropriateness and sufficiency of the environmental mitigation proposed for the facility is
the responsibility of MOEP according to Document DJ No. 131: Acceptance of Regulation for
Thermal Power Plant Environmental Mitigation Devices after Completion (MOEP, 1988). The
organizations responsible for monitoring the impacts associated with the project are determiined by
MOEP according to regulations that specify in detail the monitoring organization, personnel,
installations, duties, monitoring parameters, station locations, and monitoring periods,
methodology to be used, among other details.
PRC air and water quality standards applicable to the Phase II Project are sumunarized in
Tables 1.2-2 and 1.2-3, respectively.
1.2.1.2 PRC Environmental Protection Agencies
Environmental protection in China is implemented on three principal levels: national (or state),
provincial, and the municipal (or local). Therefore, there exists a national EPA, provincial EPA,
and an EPA at the local level for the nearest city of significant size. The Waigaoqiao Power
Plant is located within the administrative responsibility of Shanghai which, unlike smaller cities in
China, reports administratively directly to Beijing rather than to a province. Therefore, the
relevant environmental protection agencies include the national EPA and the Shanghai Municipal
EPA.
While the local and provincial EPAs are consulted as part of the EIS process, the ultimate
decision on the approval of the EIS rests entirely with the national EPA. Moreover, the published
envirownental regulations provide no detailed guidance on prioritization of impacts and how
decisions on resource use are mnade. A list of all agencies contacted in the EIS process is
provided in Appendix A.
1.2.2 SHANGHAI MUNICIPAL ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS
The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Environrnental Protection (SMBEP) is primarily responsible
for overseeing the environmental quality of the greater Shanghai area. SMBEP is comprised of
21 departments with a wide range of responsibilities related to environmental protection in
Shanghai. While SMBEP develops policies and programs aimned at decreasing levels of pollutants
from a variety of sources, the organization defers to the PRC National Enviromnental Quality
Standards for numerical guidance related to emissions and effluent as well as amnbient conditions.
1-5



9651118C/1-6
5/28/97
SMBEP has primary responsibility for monitoring industries for compliance with these standards,
a responsibilitv that is carried out through spot investigations, strategic ambient air and water
quality monitoring, and technical support to industries.
As SMBEP relates to the proposed project at Waigaoqiao, the organization has been consulted
throughout development of the project to ensure that mitigation and monitoring proposed for the
facility conforms with SMBEP policies and PRC environmental standards. Most relevant to
Phase II of the Waigaoqiao facility, SMBEP has collaborated with SMEPC to develop an
innovative approach to the Municipality requirement that all new coal-burning power plants be
equipped with flue gas desulfurization (FGD). Since the Waigaoqiao Phase II units comply with
PRC and World Bank emissions guidelines by using low-sulfur coal, the investment required to
install FGD equipment on Phase II would be considerable and would be better applied to retrofit a
facility at Sidongkou with FGD using much higher sulfur coal. This approach was developed to
ensure that the installation of FGD produces the greatest econornic benefits while offsetting sulfur
dioxide emissions of the project in the Shanghai airshed.
As stated previously, formal enviromnental approval for the Waigaoqiao facility is received from
the central rather than municipal governments. Nevertheless, SMEPC has worked closely with
SMBEP to ensure their concerns regarding the enviromnental inpacts of the facility were
adequately addressed. Moreover, SMBEP assisted with the organization and presentation during
the public meeting on environmental issues.
1.2.3 WORLD BANK REQUIREMENTS
In addition to PRC guidelines referenced in Section 1.1. 1, the World Bank also has specific
industrial pollutant discharge and ambient environmental quality standards for the power sector, as
detailed in Table 1.2-4. World Bank air quality guidelines applicable to power plants are
presented in Tables 1.2-5 and 1.2-6. Noise guidelines are presented in Table 1.2-7.
1.3 WAIGAOOIAO PHASE II POWER PLANT PROJECT
1.3.1 INTRODUCTION
In December 1996, an Economic Analysis for Waigaoqiao Coal Fired Thermal Power Plant
Phase II was prepared by Beijing Economic Research Institute of Water Resources and Electric
i -6



9651118C/1-7
5/28/97
Power. This analysis included a least cost scenario for satisfying the alarming electricity deficit
expected in Shanghai as part of its economic growth.
Currently, electricity to satisfy demand in Shanghai is imported from neighboring provinces, all
of which are experiencing power shortages. Increasing the power supply to the Shanghai power
grid was determined a priority in China's effort to improve its electricity deficit. A number of
factors make Shanghai an optimal location for power development:
1.  Shanghai has the largest population of any municipality in China with a per capita
energy consumption higher than the national average.
2.  Industrial energy demands are rapidly increasing, and
3.  Energy utilization efficiency is high, with the potential for improvements in energy
conservation.
The specific site for development of Waigaoqiao Phase II was selected as part of a long-term
planning effort by the PRC and Shanghai government. This planning was critical given the rapid
growth and acute land shortage in Shanghai. A number of reasons made the existing Waigaoqiao
site preferred for the development of Waigaoqiao Phase II:
1.  The transmission distribution system in Shanghai is currently being upgraded,
2.  Significant portions of the infrastructure required for the facility already exists through
the development of Waigaoqiao Phase I,
3.  Proximity to the Yangtze river facilitates delivery of coal and equipment to the site
and the availability of cooling water,
4.  A labor pool sufficient for the construction and operation of the facility exists in and
around Shanghai,
5.  Adequate land existed for the development of the Phase II with room for future
expansion (In contrast, other land in Shanghai is not available), and
6.  Sufficient room existed to construct large, high efficiency thermal units to improve
efficiency of the overall system.
The Waigaoqiao Phase nl Power Plant project is an integral expansion of the Waigaoqiao Power
Plant site. Construction for the four 300-MW Phase I units was initiated on November 25. 1996,
with completion of all units expected by 1997. Units I and 2 of the Phase I project were in
commercial operation at the end of 1994 and 1995, respectively. Appendix B, Figure B-1,
1-7



9651118C/I-8

presents a panoramic view of Phase I under construction. The Phase II project will consist of two
1,000-MW (nominal) units that will be in commercial operation in 2002. The planning of the site
also incorporated the addition of Phase III, which is expected to be similar in capacity as Phase II,
i.e., two 1,000-MW (nominal) units. The total capacity of the site is planned for a nominal
5,200 MW. While this EA focuses on the Phase II project, the evaluation of the project must
incorporate the existing Phase I project and deternine the environmental impacts of adding Phase
HI. Therefore, the project descriptions that follow present information on all phases of the
Waigaoqiao Power Plant complex.
1.3.2 NECESSITY FOR WAIGAOQIAO PHASE II
1.3.2.1 Descrption of Existing Power System
SMEPC provides the electric power for the Shanghai municipality with the exception of
Chongming and Changxing islands. The Shanghai electric system is part of the East China Power
Pool. The installed capacity of the SMEPC is 8,294 MW with a 1995 maximum load of 6,919
MW.
The transmission system for the Shanghai system consists of 500-kV and 220-kV circuits. The
500-kV system consists of double-circuit transmission lines that form a half circuit around a major
portion of Shanghai. The half loop is from the Sidongkou No. 2 Power Plant to Yanggao and to
Yanghang (see Figure 1.3-1). The Sidongkou-Yanggao portion runs through Huangdu, Sijn,
Nanqiao, and Shanling. As part of the Waigaoqiao Phase 11 project, the 500-kV loop will be
completed from Yanghang to Yanggao with interconnection to Waigaoqaio Phase Dl Power Plant.
1.3.2.2 Load Forecast
Shanghai, as the largest city and economic center in China, will continue to experience electric
growth. By the year 2000, the maximum load is expected to reach 11,600 MW, an annual
average load growth of over 11 percent. By 2002, the maximum load is expected to be
13,750 MW. With planned additions through 2000, the maximum capacity will be 12,277 MW.
Waigaoqiao Phase II Power Plant is needed to provide the almost 1,500 MW increase in demand
while providing an acceptable reserve margin.

9651118C/I-9
5/28/97
1.3.3 WAIGAOQIAO PLANT DESCRITION
1.3.3.1 Plant Site
The Waigaoqiao plant site is located in Northeast Pudong New Area along the Yangtze River (see
Figure 1.3-1). The site is located abotit 20 km from the Shanghai city center. The site is
bounded on the west by Gang-dian Road and on the south by Haixu Road. The Waigaoqiao New
Harbor Zone is located west of the plant. The eastem boundary currently consists of agricultural
area with residential. The area designated for power plant development for all phases is
144.4 hectares (ha) (see Figure 1.3-2). Phase II will occupy about 46 ha. To provide
construction laydown and areas for Phase III, the agricultural and residential areas will be
designated to the power plant. About 1,000 people will be relocated.
1.3.3.2 Fuel Handlin! and Storaae, Fuel Ouality
The fuel for all phases of the Waigaoqiao Power Plant will be bituminous coal from the Shenfu-
Dongshen mining area. The Shenfu-Dongshen mining area is located in the middle of Inner
Mongolia, south of the Yellow River near Baotou City in the northern part of Shanxi Province.
Available coal reserves for this area is about 1.7 billion tons.
Coal will be transported by rail to the Port of Qinhuangdao in Hebie Province and then shipped to
the Waigaoqiao Plant site in 35,000-ton shallow-draft coal ships. The coal pier constructed for
Phase I can handle docking of two coal ships. The Phase I pier is located 250 meters (m) into the
Yangtze River at a depth of about 10 rn (see Figure 1.3-2). A separate pier is planned for
Phase II and will have a similar design as the Phase I pier. The Phase II coal pier will be located
about 300 m into the Yangtze River at a depth of 10 m. For Phase III, the Phase II coal pier will
be used.
Coal is unloaded using bucket unloaders and transferred by conveyors to coal storage areas. The
Phase I unloading system has a capacity of 2,000 tons per hour (TPH), and the Phase II
conveying system has a capacity of 3,500 TPH. All conveyors are covered, except a small
portion of the pier unloaders and the stacker-reclaimer. For Phases I and II, the pier and
unloading systems will be separate. With Phase III, the conveying system will integrated, i.e.,
coal can be unloaded at either coal pier and provided to each phase's storage areas (see
Figure 1.3-2). For Phase I, there are two stacker-reclaimers which will be the sarne for Phase II.
Phase III may have up to four stacker-reclaimers due to the shorter storage length.
1-9



9651118C1-10
5/28/97
The storage area for Phase I is designed to store 260,000 tons in an area of about 600 square
meters (m2). This is sufficient for about 25 days' fuel usage. Phase II will store about
415,000 tons in an area of about 800 M2; the same amount of coal and area is planned for Phase
III. The Phase I storage area is partially covered with a drying shed; similar sheds will be used
for Phases II and III.
Coal is conveyed from the storage area or directly from the coal pier through the conveyor system
to coal crushers where its size is reduced. From the coal crushers, the coal is conveyed to coal
bunkers. See Appendix B, Figures B-2 and B-3, for photographic views of the existing coal
handling areas for Phase I and the areas to be used for Phases II and Im.
Shenfu-Dongshen coal is a low-sulfur (0.43 percent) bituminous coal with a lower heating value
of 22,760 kiloJoules per kilogram (kJ/kg) [9,806 British thermal units per pound (Btu/lb)].
Ultimate and proximate analyses of coal quality are presented in Table 1.3-1.
An evaluation of long-term coal quality related to the Shenfu-Dongshen coal used in Phase I was
conducted by ECEPDI (1997). Over a 14 month period (January 1996 through February 1997),
the average sulfur content of coal was 0.42 percent with a standard deviation of 0.023 percent.
The maximnum sulfur content was 0.457 and the lowest was 0.384. The net heating value over the
same period was 22,930 kJ/kg slightly higher (0.7 percent) than the design value. The ash
content averaged 8.44 percent compared to the design value of 11 percent. The results of this
study demonstrate the ability to meet the design coal quality.
1.3.3.3 Power Block
Phase I - The power block for Phase I will ultimately consist of four 300-MW (nominal)
subcritical units; Units 1 and 2 are in commercial operation, and Units 3 and 4 are still under
construction (as of November 1996). The boilers are constructed domestically using licensed
design technology from Combustion Engineering (CE)-ABB. Coal is delivered from the coal
bunkers to pulverizes. The pulverizes feed tangential burners that are fired at a design rate of
about 130 TPH per boiler and have a annual coal consumption of 845,100 tons per year (TPY)
per unit. The turbine generators are hydrogen cooled operating at 3,000 revolutions per minute
(rpm), 50 hertz (Hz), 20 kilovolts (kV). Design parameters and fuel usage rates for Phase I are
presented in Table 1.3-2.
1-10



9651118C1I-11
5128/97
Phase II - The power block for Phase II will consist of two 1,000-MW (nominal) super-critical
units. The boilers will be of foreign design since this technology is not currently available in
China. The SMEPC operational staff will receive training specific to super-critical unit operation
including the use of a simulator. The operational training, performed by the supplier, will also
include safety training associated with the specific characteristics of the super-critical units.
Coal is delivered from the coal bunkers to pulverizes. The pulverizes feed low-NO, burners that
are fired at a design rate of about 780 TPH per boiler and have a annual coal consumption of
5,083,000 TPY per unit. The turbine generators are hydrogen-cooled operating at 3,000 rpm and
50 Hz. A discussion on the selection of the technology proposed for Phase II is presented in
Section 4.0. Design parameters and fuel usage rates for Phase II are presented in Table 1.3-3.
Phase III - The design for Phase HI is anticipated to be a slide-along version of Phase H with
similar design and capabilities. Heavy equipment for the plant will be transported to the Shanghai
Wharf in the Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone by barge or ship. After unloading, the equipment will
be transported to the site by truck on roads with sufficient structural capability for the integrated
loads. No reinforcement will be necessary.
1.3.3.4 Water Use. SuDPIlV. and Treatment
The Yangtze River is the principal source of cooling and service water for all phases of the
Waigaoqiao Power Plant. The major use of water is for once-through condenser cooling. Phase I
will ultimately use 45.3 cubic meters per second (m3/s) of Yangtze River water for condenser
cooling. Phases H and Im will each utilize 74.2 m3/s for condenser cooling during the summer.
The intake and discharge designs for all phases are similar. Each phase will have dual intake
structures that take water at about 8 m depth and are located about 250 m from the river bank
(see Figure 1.3-2). Intake velocities are about 0.25 to 3 meters per second (m/s). Trash screens
are located at the intake and prior to the plant. Traveling screens are used prior to condenser
cooling. Chlorine at 1 to 3 parts per million (ppm) is used for biological growth control; the
residual free chlorine is kept to 0.1 ppm. Figure B-4 is a photograph of the Phase I intake
structure.
The discharge is located along the shore about 40 m from the river bank (see Figure 1.3-2). The
discharge velocity is 0.5 to 1 m/s The temperature rise resulting from the once-through
1-11



9651118C/1-12
5/28/97
condenser cooling is 8 to 9 degrees Celsius (C); (AT across the condenser of 8 to 90C).
Figure B-5 is a photograph of the discharge locations for Phases I, II, and In.
Service water is used for the steam cycle, ash sluicing, and other plant uses. Yangtze River water
used for boiler service is treated using clarification-sedimentation, reverse osmosis (RO), and
mixed-bed resin demineralization. City water will be used for all potable water purposes. The
water uses are presented in Table 1.3-4.
1.3.3.5 Wastewater Treatment and Disposal
Wastewater generated for all phases will consist of boiler treatmnent regeneration wastewater (RO
and demineralizer backwash), boiler cleaning, wash water, contact and non-contact rainfall runoff,
excess bottom ash water, and sanitary sewage. The boiler treatment regeneration wastewater is
treated using sedimentation and neutralized within a pH range of 6.5 to 8.5; the PRC discharge
standard is a pH of 6 to 9. Any potential oil-contaminated wastewater is treated in an oil
separator prior to discharge. The oil-water separator will remove oil and grease to below the
PRC standard of 10 mg/L; this wastewater will be recycled. Sewage wastewater is treated using
biological treatment (aeration) and chlorination. The sanitary sewage system will meet a
discharge quality of 30 mglL for BOD5, 35 mg/L for suspended solids, and 30 mg/L for COD.
The PRC standards are 30 mg/L, 70 mg/L and 100 mg/L, for these parameters respectively.
Water used to transport bottom ash will be dewatered in a bin. Occasionally, the boilers will be
cleaned to remove scale and deposits from operation. The wastewater generated from this
operation will be treated using settling, neutralization, and oxidation (with EDTA). This
wastewater will meet PRC standards of 70 mg/L for suspended solids and 100 mg/L for COD.
This wastewater will be recycled. The wastewater for all phases that is discharged will pass
through the once-through discharge system to the Yangtze River. Coal pile runoff is recycled or
treated using sedimentation. The ash yards are designated to retain all rainfall and no discharge is
anticipated. Types and volumes of wastewater are presented in Table 1.3-5. Figure 1.3-3
presents a water balance for Phase II.
1.3.3.6 Bvproducts (Bottom Ash and Fly Ash)
The byproducts from all phases of the Waigaoqiao Power Project primnarily consist of bottom ash
(boiler slag) and fly ash. The amount of byproducts generated by Phases I and II are presented in
Table 1.3-6. Phase III will be similar to Phase II.
1-12



9651118C11-13
5/28/97
The bottom ash is sluiced from the boiler to a dewatering area (see Figure 1.3-2). The bottom
ash for all phases will be stored (or disposed) in an area adjacent to the Yangtze River with an
area of about 1.2 million i2. A bottom ash (slag) area has been constructed for Phase I and will
be used for all phases depending on ash reuse. The area is contained by a concrete outer berm
that is constructed to a height of 7 m. Figures B-6 and B-7 present views of the existing bottom
ash storage area. Bottom ash is also used as landfill material for the Phase m coal yard.
Fly ash will be handed pneumatically from the electrostatic precipitators to storage silos
designated for each phase. If ash is stored or disposed of, it is humidified to about 20 percent
moisture and transported via conveyor to a separate ash pier (see Figure 1.3-2) onto 3,000-ton-
capacity ash barges. The barges are transported to the Limin Ash Yard an area is located about
14 man downstream from the plant site (see Figure 1.3-1). Ash will be unloaded using a bucket
crane since the high calcium in the ash prohibits the use of piping (due to plugging). An area of
1.2 million rn2 has been constructed for Phase I and will be used for the other phases depending
on ash reuse. If more area is necessary, additional storage/disposal will be located downstream in
similar configurations. About one barge per day will be transported to the ash yard for Phase II.
The storage/disposal area for the fly ash has been constructed in the littoral area of the Yangtze
River, about 800 m into the river and 1,000 m along the shoreline. The depth at the outer
perimeter is about 1.3 m. A concrete outer berm separates the storage/disposal area from the
river.
Currently, there is no ash stored from Phase I nor facilities to unload ash. All ash is currently
used in the construction industry. The area just north of the ash storage/disposal area is being
used for disposal of Haungpu River sediments which are pumped from river dredging to the
disposal area. When completed, this area will be used by the Pudong New Area Municipality. If
required for Phases II and III, the Phase I ash yard will be extended along the downstream
direction of the Yangtze.
The ash yard will be developed in sections with topsoil covering completed lifts. The Limin ash
yard has a capacity of 5.5 million cubic meters, which is sufficient to store the amount of ash
generated over 3.2 years for Phases I and II. The additional ash areas adjacent to and
downstream of the Limin ash yard have capacities of 14 million m3 and 31.5 million mn3. These
capacities are sufficient for 5 and 11 years of ash storage, respectively, for Phases I, 11, and IHI.

These areas are available to SMEPC but are not being developed since all the fly ash is recycled
for use in the construction industry.
The ash characteristics for the Shenfu-Dongshen coal are presented in Table 1.3-6. A favorable
quality of the coal that will be used for all phases of the Waigaoqiao Power Plant is the high
calcium content (about 23 percent). This property makes the ash favorable for reuse in the
construction industry. Currently all the ash generated from Phase I Units 1 and 2 is provided at
nominal cost to the construction industry. Some bottom ash has been stored/disposed of in the
bottom ash area, but it is largely open; the Limin Ash Yard has not been used. The fly ash is
delivered to enclosed cement-type trucks by a pneumatic system with pollution control (bag
filters) to minimize emissions.
Figures B-8 through B-13 are photographs of the existing Phase I fly ash disposal area from
different views.
1.3.3.7 Air Emissions, Controls, and Stack Parameters
The air emissions from the combustion of coal for all phases of the Waigaoqiao Power Plant will
be controlled using low-sulfur coal to limit emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO,), electrostatic
precipitators (ESP) to limit emissions of particulate matter (PM), and boiler design and low-NO,
combustors to limit emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOD). The flue gas from each phase will be
discharged through a 240-m stack. The air emissions and stack parameters for Phase I are shown
in Table 1.3-7; for Phase II and Phase III, these data are presented Table 1.3-8.
For Phase I, the appliable SMEPB emission limit is 261 mglNm3, whereas the design particulate
emission rate is 210 mg/Nm3. Actual particulate emission rates of 84.78 mg/Nm3 and
57.55 mg/Nm3 for Units 1 and 2, respectively, have been determined. SO2 emissions for Phase I
are limnited to 11.85 tons/hour and are mitigated using low sulfur Shenfu-Dongshen coal. The
Phase I boilers use conventional burners with a NO, emnission rate of 260 ng/J.
Phase II of the Waigaoqiao Power Plant will be designed to meet or be lower than the World
Bank, PRC, and Shanghai emissions guidelines and standards. A comparison is presented below:

An additional benefit of using Shenfu-Dongshen coal is the SO2 removal obtained from the high
calcium content. Studies using this coal have been performed on a 300-MW (nominal) unit at the
Wujing Power Plant. S02 removal efficiencies ranged from 8.5 to 17.6 percent and averaged
about 14 percent during the seven tests conducted. The SO2 removal from the high calcium
content is consistent with other studies that inject lime (CaO) directly into the boiler.
With the implementation of Phase II, the Shanghai Municipal Government has implemented a
requirement to install FGD systems for SO2 removal. The use of low-sulfur content Shenfu-
Dongshen coal obviates the need to install FGD systems on Phase 11 units to meet air quality and
emissions standards. Therefore, SMEPC has requested and obtained approval from the Shanghai
Municipality to offset the SO emissions by installing FGD on two 300-MW (nominal) units using
1.8 percent sulfur coal at the Sidongkou Power Plant. This provides a more economical approach
to SO2 removal. In addition, the installation of FGD at Sidongkou will reduce particulate
emissions. The air pollutant emissions for Phases I and II of the Waigaoqiao project are
summarized below. Also included is the emissions reductions expected from the addition of FGD
at Sidongkou Plant 1, Units 1 and 2.

it should be noted that actual particulate emissions for Phase I based on actual emission tests are
about 2,000 tons/year, or about 34 percent of the design particulate emissions. Section 4.0
presents more information on this control alternative.
Fugitive dust that may be generated from the coal and ash handling systems will be controlled for
all phases using enclosures, air pollution control devices, and watering. The coal will be
transferred from the pier to the coal storage areas and the units in enclosed conveyors. Transfer
points have air pollution control (cyclones and bagfilters). The high moisture content of the coal
(7 to 14 percent) also mitigates dust formation.
The bottom ash is handled wet with no fugitive emissions, and the fly ash is handled in closed
pneumatic systems with bagfilter systems to control loading of cement tanker trucks. If
transported to the storage/disposal area, the ash will be mixed with water in rotary mixers to
provide a non-dusting material. The existing plant has paved roads, and more are planned with
with each phase.
1.3.3.8 Transmission
As described in Section 1.3.2, a 500-kV system will interconnect Phase II and Phase III with the
SMEPC electric system. Currently, the electric power from Phase I is transmitted through a
230-kV system. The location for the 500-kV system has been under development since 1983 and
confirmed in 1993 by the Shanghai Municipal government. The location was identified by the
Shanghai Municipal Planning Design Institute and considered land use, existing linear facilities
(e.g., roads), resettlement, and public input. Towns, villages, buildings, factories, and other
developed uses are avoided. The siting was coordinated with the Pudang New Area planning
subdivision and other municipal agencies. Once the corridor is identified, construction will be
controlled by the municipal government. The current land use of the line is open land or
agricultural; any small buildings would be removed with resettlement under the Shanghai
Municipal Resettlement Bureau. Available information, including limnited observation. suggested
resettlement, if required, would not be extensive.
The transmission line has not been designed but will likely be of two possible tower designs; the
car-head and the wine-cup configurations. Tower spacing is about 450 m with heights of about
33 to 36 m. The corridor widths are generally from 65 to 70 m for the wine-cup design and 60
1-16

5/30/97
to 65 m for the cat-head design. The towers may have different dimensions depending on the
calculated electromagnetic force (EMF) relative to adjacent land use. The height and width are
designated to meet a 4 kilovolts per meter (kV/m) boundary standard. At power plant exits where
lines are bundled or crossing certain obstacles, a high tower design is used. Heights may be in
excess of 50 m in some cases. A schematic of the these designs is presented in Figure 1.3-4.

nighttime levels.
L,q (24) is the equivalent A-weighted sound level over 24 hours.
a Based on lowest level.
b Since different types of activities appear to be associated with different levels, identification of a maximum level
for activity interference may be difficult except in those circumstances where speech communication is a critical
activity.
c Based only on hearing loss.
d An L,q(8) of 75 dB may be identified in these situations so long as the exposure over the remaining 16 hours per
day is low enough to result in a negligible contribution to the 24-hour average, i.e., no greater than an L, of 60
dB.

2.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
2.1 PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
2.1.1 TOPOGRAPHY, PHYSIOGRAPHY, GEOLOGY AND SEISMICITY
The plant area and surrounding environs are flat with little or no natural topographic relief. The
site elevation averages about 4.3 meters above mean sea level (m-msl) with a. topography that
grades gently upward from the west and north to the south and east. Much of the littoral land
along the Yangtze River has been filled to levels above the immediate flood plain as a result of
regional development projects that began in 1958.
The physiography of the plant region is the Yangtze alluvial plain along the leading edge of the
Yangtze River Delta. The regional geological structural origin is at the end of the cave-in area of
the northern Jiangsu Province. Alluvial deposits are of ancient age and complex in nature. The
river delta is still actively receiving a large suspended and bed sediment load at a rate of about
500 million tonnes per year.
The power plant site and ash yard are in the frontal fringe of the Yangtze River delta's alluvial
plain. As such, the plant and ash yard areas have built up from river sediments consisting of silts
and clays. In the top 30 m, the soils are described as brownish yellow silty clay, gray sandy silt,
brown mucky silty clay, grey mucky silty clay, and grey clayey silt of the Holocene series.
Deposits from the early Pleistocene series begin at about 30 m in depth to about 90 m and consist
of silts and clays with sands beginning at about 70 m in depth.
The underlying soil requires pile construction with reinforced concrete square pile, prestressed
reinforced concrete pipe pile, and steel pipe pile as acceptable alternatives. For Phase I, steel
piles driven to about 70 m depth were used for the main building and structures.
The plant site is considered to have a low probability and intensity for seismic activity.
Construction on piles would mitigate any probable activity from slight soil liquefaction under the
reported intensity.

2.1.2 AIR RESOURCES
2.1.2.1 Climatology
Geographically, China is roughly circular in form and lies east-northeast of the Indian
subcontinent. China extends from 22 to 52 degrees north (N) latitude and 74 to 134 degrees east
(E) longitude and is 9,561,000 square kilometers (kn2) [3,692,000 square miles (mi2)] in area.
This vast expanse of land gives full opportunity for continental weather conditions to develop a
cold area of high barometric pressure in the winter as well as low-pressure hot areas in the
summer. The Himalaya Mountains on the southwest border of China blocks the monsoon weather
patterns that India experiences during the summer from reaching westem China. For this reason,
most areas of northern and western China average less than 1,000 millimeters (mm) of rain per
year. The exception to this rule is the coastal area of China which annually has precipitation
values greater than 1000 mm. Rainfall amounts decrease rapidly from the southeast to the
northwest. The reason for this decrease is the movement of the summer monsoons, in which the
interior of China is beyond the reach of the Pacific air mass flow.
In China, the winds are generally from a northerly direction in winter and from the southeast in
summer. The causes of the reversal of the wind system are related to both the large size of the
Asian continent and adjacent oceans, and the very high and extensive Himalayan mountain range
(Tibet Plateau) of the continent. This range is oriented in an east-west direction and forms a
barrier between tropical (monsoonal) and polar air masses.
2.1.2.2 Site Meteorologv
The Waigaoqiao Power Plant site, located on the eastern coast of China at the mouth of the
Yangtze River, lies at approximately 31.20 north latitude and 121.5 east longitude. This area
has a coastal season climate whose weather is moderated by the Yangtze River and East China
Sea. The nearest meteorological station to the plant site is the Gaoqiao Hydrological and
Meteorological Station, located within 10 km of the plant site. From 1975 to 1984, this station
recorded the following annual meteorological data:
Average annual atmospheric pressure           1016.3 hundred Pascals (hPa)
Average annual temperature                    15.7 degrees Celsius (C)

Average hottest month temperature           31.50C
Average coldest month temperature           0.40C
Average annual precipitation                1046.9 mm
Maximum 24-hour precipitation               381 nmn
Average annual evaporation                  1,455.6 mm
Average annual relative humidity            80 percent
Average annual wind speed                   4.0 meters per second (m/s)
Prevailing wind direction, annual           SE
Prevailing wind direction, winter           NNW
Prevailing wind direction, annual           ESE
For this study, 1 year of meteorological data were obtained from the Gaoqiao station and
processed for analysis and use in the air quality dispersion model. The frequencies of hourly
wind directions and wind speeds from January to December 1995 are shown in the windrose
presented in Figure 2.1-1. Wind directions were reported as I of 16 sectors with each sector
covering 22.50. Wind speeds were reported in meters per second and classified into one of six
categories. In this windrose, the length of the bar indicates the frequency of wind direction
sector, and the width of the bar indicates the frequency of a wind speed category. From this
windrose, the annual prevailing wind direction was from the south-southeast, with a high
frequency of winds occurring from the east-northeast clockwise through south-southeast. The
annual average wind speed was about 3 m/s.
The monthly average maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures during 1995 are shown in
Table 2.1-1. As shown, the annual average mean temperature is about 16.4 C with the lowest
monthly average temperature of 4.9C occurring in January and the highest monthly average
temperature of 28.8C occurring in August.
2.1.2.3 Ambient Air Oualitv
The City of Shanghai, like all major industrialized urban area, has many anthropogenetic sources
of air pollution. During the past decade, growth has continued with concomitant increases in

construction, industrialization, and air pollution. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of
Environmental Protection (SMBEP) has established a network for monitoring the ambient air
quality. The parameters measured by SMBEP that are relevant to the Waigaoqiao Power Project
are sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO,), and total suspended particulates (TSP). The
methodology used by SMBEP is consistent with that recommended by EPA for measuring these
pollutants. SO2 and NO,, are measured using continuous monitors meeting EPA specifications.
S02 is measured using a Thermo Electron Company (TECO) Model 43 SQ analyzer, and NQ is
measured using a TECO Model 14BIE NO, analyzer. TSP is measured using gravimetric
procedures consistent with those promulgated by EPA.
Monitoring is performed at numerous stations within the Shanghai Municipality. Air quality
measurements indicate that sulfur dioxide and total suspended particulate levels in the urban areas
are generally about a factor of 2 higher than in rural areas. For sulfur dioxide, urban
concentrations averaged 53 sg/m3, whereas rural concentrations averaged 12 jsg/md (SMBEP,
1996). Citywide concentrations for sulfur dioxide average 32 Ag/m3. For total suspended
particulate matter, urban concentrations averaged nearly 250 ig/M3, whereas rural concentrations
averaged 175 jig/M3. Citywide concentrations for TSP average 237 /Ag/rn3.
SMBEP has implemented countermeasures to reduce air pollution in Shanghai, including:
1. Relocating or restructuring factories and workshops to reduce air emissions,
2.  Utilizing gas and reuse of energy resources,
3.  Promoting district heating, and
4.  Regulating construction industry practices to reduce dust emissions (e.g., enclosing
buildings during construction).
Urban sulfur dioxide concentrations, as determined from daily averages, have been reduced by
more than 30 percent. Urban TSP concentrations have reduced by more than 15 percent.
SMBEP will continue to implement the countermeasures to improve air quality.
For the Waigaoqiao Power Project, TSP. NO, and SO2 data were obtained for four stations
(Waigaoqiao, Jingqiao, Lujiazui, and Jichang) in the vicinity of the plant and where impacts are
most likely. SO2 data were obtained for two stations (Baoshan and Putuo) where interaction
between the Sidongkou and Waigaoqiao are most important. Figure 2.1-2 shows the locations of
2-4



9651118C/2-5
05/28/97
the six air quality monitoring stations relative to the Waigaoqiao Power Plant. The maximun and
annual average concentrations observed at each station are also shown on Figure 2.1-2.
Table 2.1-2 presents a complete summary of annual data for 1995 for the four stations in vicinity
of the plant.
The monitoring data collected by SMBEP indicate that the ambient air quality standards for TSP
are exceeded at all stations. The maximum daily TSP concentrations measured routinely exceeded
both the World Bank 1988 guidelines and PRC Class II standards for particulates, which are
0.500 nilligram per cubic meter (mg/m3) and 0.300 mglm3, respectively. The maximum daily
concentrations exceed the PRC Class 11 standards by 150 to 190 percent, while the observed TSP
concentrations are near the World Bank guidelines for the four stations in the Pudong New Area.
The annual average (mean) concentrations of TSP exceed the World Bank guidelines by about
240 percent. The data represent particles with an aerodynamic diameter ranging from less than
1 mnicrometer (,am) to about 100 am. For inhalable particulates, the aerodynamic diameter is
represented by particles of 10 pm or less, referred to as PM 10. While the data represent both
PM10 and larger particles, the high concentration of TSP suggest that the SMBEP standard for
PM1O of 0.040 milligram per normal cubic meter (mg/Nm3) may be exceeded. Indeed, the
annual average TSP concentrations at the four stations is projected to be 6 to nearly 8 times the
PM1O standard.
The source of the high TSP concentrations is a result of the construction activities that are
occurring all over the Municipality of Shanghai. Industrial sources, which include power plants,
and other area sources such as transportation contribute to the observed concentrations.
The maximum daily (24-hour) background S02 concentrations in the area where the Waigaoqiao
Power Plant would impact, ranges from 0.064 to 0.219 mg/m3; annual average SO2 concentrations
range from 0.015 to 0.050 mg/m3. These concentrations are below both the World Bank and
PRC Class II ambient air quality standards of 0.500 mg/m3 and 0.150 mg/m3, respectively, for
the maximum 24-hour and annual averaging times.
The SO2 concentrations observed for the Putuo monitoring station located in Central Shanghai and
the Baoshan monitoring station located near the Sidongkou plant suggest quite different results
from each other. While the observed SO2 concentrations for the Putuo and Baoshan monitoring
2-5



9651118C/2-6
05/30/97
stations meet the PRC Class II and World Bank guidelines for both the maximum 24-hour and
annual averaging times, the concentrations at Putuo are generally higher.  The annual average at
this station is higher than the other five stations and likely reflects source contributions from area
sources. This station is located in central Shanghai where area sources can significantly
contribute. In contrast, the SO, concentrations observed at the Baoshan monitoring are similar to
those observed in the area north of central Shanghai in the Pudang New Area (i.e., near the
Waigaoqiao area). The predominant easterly winds indicated generally better air quality in the
eastern portion of Shanghai as evidenced by the observations at Jichang.
The observed air quality for NO,, is below the SMBEP and World Bank guidelines with the
exception of several instances where the maximum 24-hour concentration is marginally above the
SMBEP standard of 0. 150 mg/Nm3. The annual NO,, concentration in the area is below the
SMBEP and the World Bank guidelines.
As used in this report, background concentration represents air concentrations from all air
pollution sources that currently exist. Thus, any new addition could contribute to the observed
concentrations. The data collected at Waigaoqiao, Jingqiao, and Lujiazui are considered to be
most representative of background conditions in the areas where the proposed plant would impact
(i.e., within 7 km of the plant). For the annual average, the average of these stations was
selected as the background concentration used in modeling. The average of the 90th percentile
values was selected as the 24-hour background concentration to provide a conservative estimate of
impacts.
2.1.2.4 Noise
Noise levels at Waigaoqiao Power Plant site was measured by SMEPC and KBN at the interior of
the site and along the plant boundary. The monitoring was conducted to determiine the noise
levels in A-weighted decibels (dBA) which account for the human ear response to noise (see
Section 3.1.2 for more detailed explanation).
The SMEPC monitoring was conducted at over 30 locations within the plant site and 14 locations
along the plant boundaries. The monitoring along the boundaries included both daytime and
nighttime measurements. The KBN monitoring was conducted at interior locations and along the
western, southem, and eastern boundaries.
2-6



9651118C/2-7
05/28/97
The maximum noise levels occurred north of Phase I Units I and 2 for both the SMEPC and
KBN monitoring. Noise levels were at or above 80 dBA. The noise levels along the boundaries
are summarized below:
Boundary             SMEPC                  KBN
Western              45 to 50 dBA           61 to 65 dBA
Southern            48 to 58 dBA            58 to 61 dBA
Eastern             48 to 53 dBA            55 to 56 dBA
Northern            43 to 63 dBA            Not measured
At the time of the KBN monitoring, there was a tonal (single frequency) noise measured at
63 hertz of 73 dB which may have contributed to the observed higher levels at the western
boundary than SMEPC monitoring. The noise appeared to originate from the Unit 1 boiler area.
This may be a transient noise source.
The observed noise levels comply with the World Bank guidelines and the Shanghai Class III and
IV noise standards (see Section 3.1.2 for description of the Shanghai noise standards).
2.1.3 WATER RESOURCES
The Yangtze River, also known as the Changjiang River, is the largest river system in China.
The Yangtze Estuary lies along a mesotidal coast with abundant discharge and sediment supply.
The Yangtze River ranks fourth among the world's major rivers with an annual suspended
sediment discharge of 4.72x10s tons, which is an average from 1951 to 1976 (Ren et al., 1983).
The Yangtze River is divided into two branches, the South Branch and the North Branch (refer to
Figure 2.1-3. Most of the runoff flows to the sea through the South Branch. The South Branch
is further divided into the North Passage and the South Passage. The South Passage is again
divided into the North Channel and the South Channel. The Shanghai Waigaoqiao Power Plant is
located on the south shore of the South Passage of the Yangtze River.
The annual average discharge of the Yangtze River is about 30,200 m3/sec. The North Branch
carries practically no net flow leaving the South Branch being the predominant branch. The
North Passage carries two-thirds of flow and the South Passage the other third. The annual
2-7



9651118C/2-8
05128/97
runoff of the Yangtze River is 9.25x103 rn3, and 70 percent of it concentrates in the months
between May and October (Wang et al., 1983).
The Huangpu River, also known as the Wusongkuo River, is the last tributary of the Yangtze
River. The Huangpu River lies north of the power plant. Two hydrologic stations are located
along the Yangtze River shore within the vicinity of plant (see Figure 2.1-3). The Gaoqiao
hydrologic station is located 8 kmn downstream of the Huangpu River, just south of the power
plant. The Bailongjiang hydrologic station is located further south of the power plant, 28 kmn
downstream of the Huangpu River.
The tides within the vicinity of the plant are mixed semi-diurnal tides. Listed in Table 2.1-3 are
the tidal elevations recorded at the Gaoqiao hydrologic station along with the tidal spectrum.
The tidal flow is lateral to the shoreline and wind induced. Since the Yangtze River flow is
abundant, the ebb tide duration is apparently longer then the flood tide duration regardless of
season. The ratio between the ebb and flood tide durations is about 1.5. The characteristics of
typical tides are shown below in Table 2.1-4 for the neap, mean, spring, and 97 percent
frequency tides.
During the hottest months, July to September, the mean daily water temperature is 29.6C.
Table 2.1-5 presents the water temperature of the Yangtze River for the years from 1985 to 1987.
The Yangtze River at Waigaoqiao is designated as Class III and IV waters (see Table 1.2-3),
which is suitable for fishing, swimming, irrigation, and other non-potable uses. Table 2.1-6
presents water quality data for the vicinity of the plant site. Located south of the site is the
Zhyuan sewage discharge port. The port is of a multi-difusion design that is located about
750 meters (m) south and about 1,500 m into the Yangtze River at a depth of about 15 m. After
the sewage port began operation, water quality samples were taken along three sections of the
multi-port difusser at four different depths. Table 2.1-7 present the results of the sampling. The
results indicate that the water quality would meet the Class III and IV standards near the sewage
discharge port.

2.2 ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT
2.2.1 TERRESTRAL RESOURCES
The site for the Phase II expansion of the Waigaoqiao Power Plant including coal pile expansion
is located on land which could now best be described as ruderal (or wasteland as characterized in
PRC). The vegetation cover in these areas is comprised of species of plants which are indicative
of land which has been previously cleared and impacted. All the species of plants in evidence are
weedy and commnonly appear when land has been cleared or tilled for farming. These plants are
very common throughout this area and move easily via wind and water. These weeds are adapted
to take advantage of disturbed conditions. If a bare spot is created and suitable moisture and
temperature conditions exist they sprout quickly. These two areas are primarily covered by the
following dominant plants: Calystegia hederacea, Japanese Bindweed; Phragmites communis,
Common Reed; Pennisetum alopecuroides, Chinese Permisetum; and Solidago species, Goldenrod.
All of these plants are common and characteristic of wastelands, grasslands, roadsides, and
farmlands. No unusual plants or those considered rare by the International Union for
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources were observed or are in evidence.
A terrestrial area has been created from the littoral zone of the Yangtze River for the Limin Ash
Yard. This large area has been created for storage of fly ash produced by the Waigaoqiao Power
Plant in the event it is not used in construction. This area is adjacent to the Yangtze River and is
separated from the river by a massive berm. No ash has been deposited into this storage area as
yet. Upland, wetland, and open water exist in the ash yard. The shallow open water areas are
being used by local farmers to harvest shrimp that have developed in the open water. The upland
and some of the wetland areas are being grazed by cattle. The wetland vegetation in evidence is
all characteristic of fresh water which indicates that the brackish water at this spot on the Yangtze
River is not seeping past the berm. (Refer to Figures B-16 and B-17 in Appendix B for
photographs of the alternative use.)
The vegetation is all characteristic of weedy, open, previously cleared land. The vegetated
portions of the ash yard are dominated by the following wetland and upland plants: Phragmzites
communis, Common Reed; Leptochloa species, Sprangletop; Cynodon dacrylon, Bermuda Grass;
Pennisetum alopecuroides, Chinese Penniserum; Potentilla supina, Cinqefoil; Solidago species,
Goldenrod; and Turczaninowiafastigiata, an aster. All of these species are weedy and occur
commonly in wastelands, grasslands, farmlands, and roadsides. No unusual plants or those

considered rare by the Inernational Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources are
in evidence.
2.2.2 AQUATIC RESOURCES
The Yangtze River estuary is one of the largest estuarine areas in coastal China. Estuaries are
extraordinarily valuable because of their economic role in nearshore and oceanic fisheries. The
Yangtze River has been heavily degraded in recent decades, chiefly due to contamination from
industrial wastes, ship-borne wastes, untreated municipal sewage, stormwater runoff, and vastly
increased sediment loads due to upstrearn deforestation.
Early life stages of marine fish and crustacea seek low-salinity areas of estuaries to avoid
predators as well as to take advantage of high natural productivity. These areas are one of a
series of habitats critical for maintaining fish populations over broad narine areas, including bays
and nearshore oceanic regions. The estuarine reaches of the lower Yangtze River, given its size,
once supported important crustacean and finfish capture fisheries over an enormous length of the
regional coastline. However, though a wide variety of low salinity habitats serve as nursery
areas, a conmmon requirement is for structural shelter and relatively low current velocities. The
portion of the Yangtze near the Waigaoqiao Plant is highly channelized, with strong tidal
fluctuation, high current velocities, high sediment load, and relatively little structural shelter.
Indeed, the sediment load of the river indicates light penetration of only several centimeters,
which in not conducive for estuary habits with aquatic plants. Although this reach of the Yangtze
may serve as a transport for early life stages of nearshore marine organisms, the area's relative
value as a nursery is low (Shanghai Academy of Sciences, 1996).
Originating with a variety of land-based sources, these local estuaries have undergone severe
degradation in historic times. Quantitative evidence in support of this degradation includes
reduced biodiversity and fisheries landings.
One statistical measure of biodiversity is the Shannon-Weaver Index of Biodiversity. Essentially
comparing dominance of individual species over total expected species, low indices (i.e.,
dominance of a few species) are accepted as indicative of polluted water conditions. According to
the Chinese Academy of Aquaculture (CAA, 1989), diversity indices at all sampling stations fell
between 0.36 and 1.89. Expected indices in severely polluted waters are below 1.0, while 1.0 to
2-10



9651118C/2-11
05130/97
3.0 indicate moderately polluted waters. In aggregate, the CAA study validates the prevailing
viewpoint that the Yangtze River estuarine complex is severely compromised due to
environmental degradation.
Despite the environmental conditions, the estuary supported a fishery for both finfish (principally
clupeids such as anchovies) and crustaceans, including both marine (Penaeus spp.) and freshwater
(Macrobrachium spp.) forms. However, aggregate catch has declined over a 5-year period from
1982 to 1987 (CCA, 1989), falling from 204 metric tons (m.t.) in 1982 to 9 m.t. in 1987.
Catches have fallen to near-zero in recent years, although it is not known whether continued water
quality degradation or newly imposed fishing restrictions are the cause.
Though 98 genera and 108 species of finfish and crustacea inhabit the lower Yangtze, the
principal commercial species are relatively few. These are listed below.
Common Name            Scientific Name
Crustacea           Prawn                  Palaemon antrorum

2.3 SOCIAL. CULTURAL AND INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT
2.3.1 LAND USE
The project site is located within the Pudong New Area. Located southwest of the Yangtze
River, east of the Huangpu River, and facing the Shanghai Bund. The Pudong New Area is a
triangular parcel of land with an area of 522 km2 and a population of 1.4 million. The Pudong
new area is considered a focal point to the government of Shanghai and the PRC's development
strategy for the cities along the Yangtze River Basin. As such, the development plan for the area
allocates land for urban, industrial, and comnnercial activities that will establish the Pudong New
Area as the international economic, finance, and trade center of region.
2-11



9651118C12-12
s5128/97
The Pudong New Area is administered by the Municipality of Shanghai. Although no formal land
use classification system is currently implemented within Shanghai, the Shanghai municipal
government's Planning Bureau has established a development plan for the Pudong New Area
which allocates land for a variety of land uses. Since land availability is at a premium in
Shanghai, this planning exercise ensures that future land use is consistent with the development
goals of the Shanghai municipality. Figure B-14 in Appendix B represents the latest (November
1996) land uses associated with the development plan for the Shanghai municipality, including the
Pudong New Area (printed maps not yet available).
The land allocated the three phases of the Waigaoqiao facility at one time represented a
combination of industrial, agricultural, and residential land uses. SMEPC has been allocated the
land required for the three phases of the Waigaoqiao facility and its ancillary facilities such as the
transmission line. As a result, SMEPC has engaged in a systematic, long-term plan to secure the
area for industrial development.
The majority of the site for Waigaoqiao Phases II and III is currently in use as a staging area for
construction of the facility. Some portions of the site still exist as residential areas surrounded by
small plots of cultivated land. Other industries in the Pudong new area in close proximity to the
project site include an oil refinery and chemical works. While land use immediately adjacent the
proposed site is predominantly industriai and urban, the surrounding areas consist of small
villages connected by two-laned paved roads. Agricultural activities noted in the villages within a
30-lan radius of the project site include crop production (cabbage, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes,
cilantro, greens, spinach, ginger, onions, rice, green beans, eggplant, etc.) and livestock (cows,
hogs, chickens, ducks, and goats).
There are no systematic laws that specify how a particular parcel of land is categorized for land
use. Approval on the appropriateness of land acquisition for the power station was provided by
the Municipal Planning Bureau of Shanghai. Throughout the project development process,
SMEPC has coordinated the proposed change in land use with the Society Representatives from
local comnmunities. During the public meeting conducted by SMEPC on December 9. 1993, as
well as during interviews with residents closest to the site, the nearby villagers expressed an
eagemess to see the site developed since they were not benefiting from the current land use and
they perceived that the power station would improve the standard of living for the surrounding
2-12



9651118C12-13
05/28/97
villages. Those residents who were to be relocated as part of Waigaoqiao Phase II expressed
support of the relocation since the area in which the residents would relocate provided better
services, most notably in water and electricity supply and indoor plumbing, and SMEPC indicated
a plan to offer training and job placement to displaced residents. Records of the public meeting is
attached as Appendix C.
The land required for the Waigaoqiao power plant (Phase II and IE), including ash storage,
during the first two phases is approximately 200 hectares. Of this, 22.75 percent is comprised of
farmland, 2.6 percent is residential, and 74.99 percent is an area being held for ash storage
(ECEPDI, 1996). Cement dikes surround the ash storage yard, creating an area relatively
independent of the surrounding tidal area. While this area is currently classified as "wasteland,'
meaning it has already been impacted and is unsuitable for other use, the ponds created by the
construction of the ash storage yard are used informally my some farmers in the area to harvest
prawns and for cow grazing (see Figures B-16 and B-17 in Appendix B). This use is not
currently distrubed since 100 percent of the ash for Phase I at Waigaoqiao is reused, making it
unnecessary for the storage of ash at this previously constructed site. Additional land has been
reserved to expand the ash storage yard for Phases II and llI of the facility; however, given the
current ash utilization rate, this development is not likely in the near future.
2.3.2 SOCIOECONOMICS
As noted previously, the Pudong New Area is being systematically developed to play a key role in
the economic development of the Yangtze River Basin. The area offers excellent potential for
economic growth due the state of its infrastructure, roads, railways, and conmmunications. As
noted in previous sections, the Shanghai Electric Power Grid is considered an important part of
the East China Power Grid and critical to future economic development throughout East China.
2.3.2.1 DemorraRhv
Shanghai is the largest city in China, with an estimated population of more than 20 million. The
current population of the Pudong New Area is 1.4 million. While no new population statistics for
Pudong New Area were available during the field visits, the Municipal Planning Bureau
anticipates and is planning for an influx in population as a result of the rapid development planned
for the area. Most recently, significant numbers of laborers have been moving into the area from
other areas of China to accommodate the labor needs of the rapidly growing construction sector.
2-13



9651118C/2-14
05/28/97
The power plant site was once a combination of unoccupied land that had already been impacted
by small businesses, industry, and agriculture practices. Currently, residents from Jiang Zhang
Zhai, the nearest village, reside on portions of the land allocated for Phase II at Waigaoqiao.
Approximately 1,000 of these residents will need to be relocated to secure the land for the
subsequent phases of the project. A resettlement plan is being developed by SMEPC in
cooperation with World Bank consultants.
According to ECEPDI, the power plant will employ 2,500 workers at its peak during
construction. The workers will come from the greater Shanghai area.  During operation, the
facility will require a work force of about 800 skilled and unskilled labor. Similarly, these
workers will reside in the greater Shanghai area, as well as specifically in the Pudong New Area.
Therefore, there will be no need to construct workers colonies for either the construction or
operational labor force. Nevertheless, some residential capacity already exists for plant workers
on the site.
The aligiunent for the additional 50 km transmission line has been secured by the Department of
Roads and is currently unoccupied. The alignment for the transmission line, which has been
developing for 11 years, follows a major highway for a significant portion of the route. Criteria
for siting the remainder of the route included measures to avoid towns and existing buildings and
collocating with existing linear facilities.
2.3.2.2 Emulovment and Opporeunitv
The greater Shanghai area, including the Pudong New Area, is experienced dynamic commercial
growth and offers the range of economic activities evident in other large metropolises worldwide,
from light manufacturing, retail sales, and exports to large-scale industrial development. The
development plan for the Pudong New Area is key to this continued economic growth.
Of the residents in the vicinity of the Pudong New Area, about 900,000 are employed in non
agricultural activities within greater Shanghai, while the remainder comprised mixed employment
outside the project area (Surveying Institute of Shanghai, 1994).
2-14



9651118C/2-15
05/28/97
As noted previously, approximately 2,500 workers will be employed at the peak period of
construction and 800 employees will comprise the operational staff during Phase II (SMEPC,
1996) with an estimated total of 800 for Phase EmI.
2.3.2.3 Transportation
While roads throughout the Pudong New Area are continuously being upgraded, a major highway
makes access to the Waigaoqiao site easily accessible. The front of the facility is bordered by the
Yanggao Road. The boundary between the site on the west and the Shanghai New Harbor area is
Gangdian road. Haixu and Yanggao are both expressways that serve as main arteries through the
Pudong New Area. They are connected to the Shanghai city center by the Nanpu and Yangpu
bridges and the Huangpu river tunnel.
During construction, heavy equipment will be off loaded at Waigaoqiao harbor and transported by
truck via Gangdian and Haixu roads. Transporting ash to the ash yard will occur by barge
transport from the dedicated jetty at the project site. Trucks currently unload the ash from the
temporary storage facility and transport it to construction sites throughout Shanghai by road.
Shanghai's major airport, Honqiao Iternational Airport, is located approximately 40 lan from the
site. Additionally, Shanghai is a major hub for rail, bus, and waterway transport. Future
developments planned for Shanghai include connecting the Waigaoqiao New Harbor Area to the
Jianshan railway from the south, an underground rail system to connect the Pudong New Area to
Shanghai city center, and a new international airport to be located near Heqing, 14 lan south of
the site.
2.3.2.4 Facilities and Services
Shanghai offers the range of facilities and services typical of large cities including hospitals,
firefighting capabilities, security (i.e., police) facilities, and a wide range of adult educational
facilities. The development plan for Pudong New Area includes shops, primary schools,
kindergartens, hospitals, banks, postal and telecommunications services, and residential units, the
construction of many of which are either underway or completed. These facilities are considered
essential to support the Pudong New Area as it grows into the economic center for which it is
planned. No schools, hospitals (other than an on-site clinic), or residential units are planned for
2-15



9651118C/2-16
05/28/97
construction within the proximity of the Waigaoqiao facility, since the area has been reserved for
industrial development.
Moreover, the power plant will maintain its own clinic, firefighting and other emergency
equipment, and plant security.
2.3.3 CULTURAL RESOURCES
Shanghai is considered a popular spot for tourism and boasts all of the hotel, restaurants,
shopping, and other amenities offered by other large cities worldwide. The Pudong New Area is
separated from the Shanghai city center by the Huangpu River. The Bund is a favorite tourist
destination for both Chinese and foreigners since the elevated walkway constructed along the
Huangpu river provides an excellent vantage point from which to view the European styled
architecture reminiscent of Shanghai during the 1920s and 1930s when it was considered the
"Paris of the East" (Pan, Holdsworth, and Hunt, 1995). The impressive architecture of the
Oriental Pearl television tower in the Pudong New Area is clearly visible from the walkway,
adding to the skyline of the area. The Bund, which is being refurbished to its former glory, is
host to numerous structures of historical significance to Shanghai's history.
The site of the Waigaoqiao facility is on a wedge of land in the Pudong New Area that has
experienced significant agricultural, residential, industrial, and other commercial impacts
previously. The Shanghai Municipal Cultural Relic Management Bureau has certified that there
are no archaeological or cultural resources on the site (refer to Appendix D).

3.0 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT
3.1 PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
3.1.1 AIR QUALITY
3.1.1.1 Introduction
An air quality impact assessments were performed to predict maximum SO2 PM, and NO,
impacts due to the proposed Waigaoqiao Power Plant expansion plans. These impacts were
predicted in the areas surrounding the power plant for the proposed Phases II and III projects.
The Phase II Project includes the addition of two 1,000-MW coal-fired units and associated
material-handling facilities at the existing power plant site which will consist of four 300-MW
coal-fired units. The Phase m Project also includes the addition of two 1,000-MW coal-fired
power plants and associated material-handling facilities which will result in a total of eight coal-
fired units generating 5,200 MW of electricity at the Waigaoqiao Power Plant. For the SO,
impact analyses, the SO2 emissions from the Shidongkou Power Plant were included, since two of
the 300-MW units at the plant will install an FGD system to control SO2 emissions when Phase II
becomes operational. The installation of FGD on two 300-MW units will offset the SO,
emissions from Waigaoqiao Phase II. A similar strategy is planned for Waigaoqiao Phase Im.
3.1.1.2 Air Modeliin Methodologv
3.1.1.2.1 General Modeling Approach
Because the environmental regulatory agencies have not established procedures or policies for
performing air quality impact assessments, the general modeling approach followed U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) modeling guidelines using EPA-approved air dispersion
models. These models and guidelines were used because they offer validated techniques for
estimating maximum ground-level concentrations and are used extensively for comparing air
quality impacts with air quality standards. highest predicted concentrations from the modeling
analysis are reported. The highest concentrations predicted from the modeling analysis were
compared to World Bank standards.
3.1.1.2.2 Model Selection
The selection of the appropriate air dispersion model is based on its ability to simulate impacts for
the type of air emission sources being evaluated and to account for surrounding areas that can
affect plume dispersion from those sources (e.g., terrain features, land use type). The areas
3-i



9651118C/3-2
05/29/97
around the plant site are generally at or slightly higher than the elevation of the plant site. Based
on EPA modeling guidance, areas lower than stack top elevations are referred to as simple
terrain. Areas with elevations above the stack top elevation are referred to as complex terrain
areas. Because the existing and proposed stack heights are higher than the surrounding terrain,
the area around the plant site is considered to be simple terrain.
Also, for this project, the air dispersion model must be able to address impacts due to fugitive
particulate emissions from coal-handling operations. Because the vents for the coal-handling
activities (e.g., transfer points) are relatively low with respect to associated buildings, the air
dispersion methods should account for the disturbed air flow around the building and estimate
plume dispersion affected by building downwash effects.
Based on these criteria, the Industrial Source Complex (ISC) dispersion model (EPA, 1996) has
been selected to evaluate the potential pollutant emissions from the air emission sources at the
power plants considered in this study. This model, which is available from EPA's Technology
Transfer Network, an electronic bulletin board service, is an Appendix A model in EPA's
Guideline on Air Quality Models (1996). An Appendix A model is a preferred model since it
performs better than others for given applications for a particular study. For this project, the ISC
model is best suited to address air quality impacts since it can assess impacts in simple terrain,
account for building downwash effects, and estimate impacts from fugitive particulate emissions.
The ISC model consists of two sets of computer codes that are used to calculate short- and long-
term ground-level concentrations. The main differences between the two codes are the input
format of the meteorological data and the method of estimating the plume's horizontal dispersion.
The first model code, the ISC short-term (ISCST3) model, Version 96113, is an extended version
of the single-source (CRSTER) model (EPA. 1977). The ISCST3 model is designed to calculate
hourly concentrations based on hourly meteorological parameters (i.e., wind direction. wind
speed, atmospheric stability, ambient temperature, and mixing heights). The hourly
concentrations are processed into non-overlapping, short-term, and longer averaging periods (e.g..
monthly, annual). The second model code within the ISC model is the ISC long-term (ISCLT)
model. The ISCLT model uses joint frequencies of wind direction, wind speed. and atmospheric
stability to calculate seasonal andJor annual average ground-level concentrations.
3-2



9651118C/3-3
05/29/97
For this study, the ISCST3 was used to predict maximum ground-level impacts from stack and
fugitive emission sources (i.e., point and area sources) at the Waigaoqiao Power Plant and stack
emission sources at the Sidongkou Power Plant for all averaging periods to address compliance
with ambient air quality standards.
3.1.1.2.3 Model Options
The EPA regulatory default options were used with the ISCST3 model. These include:
1.  Final plume rise at all receptor locations,
2.  Stack-tip downwash,
3.  Buoyancy-induced dispersion,
4.  Default wind speed profile coefficients,
5.  Default vertical potential temperature gradients, and
6.  Calm wind processing.
Because the Waigaoqiao Power Plant is located along the Yangtze River, the majority of the land
use within 3 km of plant site is considered rural. As a result, rural dispersion parameters and
those options that have a rural designation (e.g., wind speed profile coefficients, vertical potential
temperature gradients) were selected for use in the ISCST3 model.
3.1.1.2.4 Source and Emission Data
The SO2, PM, and NOa emission data for Phases I, II, and III of the Waigaoqiao Power Plant
were provided to KBN from data supplied by the East China Electric Power Design Institute
(ECEPDI). Model runs were performed for SO, and PM emissions for Phase II and Phase III.
The stack, operating, and emission data used in the modeling analysis for the coal-fired units at
the Waigaoqiao Power Plant are presented in Table 3.1-1. The stack, operating, and PM
emission data for material handling operations are presented in Table 3.1-2. Detailed descriptions
of these operations and development of PM emission rates are presented in Appendix E.
The stack, operating, and SO, emission data used in the modeling analysis for the coal-fired units
at the Shidongkou Power Plant are presented in Table 3.1-3.

3.1.1.2.5 Building Downwash Effects
In 1985, EPA promulgated final stack height regulations, including a good engineering practice
(GEP) stack height definition. GEP stack height is defined as the highest of:
1.  65 m; or
2.  A height established by applying the formula:
Hg = Hb + 1.5 Lt
Where   Hg = GEP stack height,
Hb = height of structure or nearby structure, and
Lb = lesser dimension (height or width) of nearby structure(s), or
3.  A height demonstrated by a fluid model or field study.
Any physical stack with a height less than GEP stack height must be evaluated for potential
building downwash effects.
Based on the building dimensions associated with the buildings and structures at the power plant,
the stacks for coal-fired units for Phases I through III are at or exceed the height at which
building downwash effects would occur. The power plant stack heights are 240 m which are
more than 2.5 times the height of the tallest structure. As a result, the structures will not cause
plume downwash from the proposed stacks. Therefore, the effects of building downwash for the
coal-fired units were not considered in the modeling analysis.
For the material handling operations at the Waigaoqiao Power Plant, the operations, such as
transfer points, are enclosed and have cyclones to capture the PM which are emitted through a
vent near or at the top of the structure. Since the vent is considered to be a point source, the
release height was assumed to be the structure height. As a result, building downwash effects
were considered for these sources since the vent heights were less than 2.5 times the height of the
structure. The associated building heights and widths for these sources which were used in
building downwash estimations are presented in Table 3.1-2.
3.1.1.2.6 Meteorological Data
Meteorological data needed to perform the complex terrain modeling analysis using the ISCST3
model consist of the following five meteorological parameters:
3-4



9651118C/3-5
05129/97
1.  Wind direction-determines the transport directions toward which the plume will
travel and potentially affect receptors downwind of the plant,
2.  Wind speed-deternines the amount of dilution of plume concentration and height to
which the plume will rise,
3.  Temperature-affects the height to which the plume will rise and also is used in
estimating afternoon mixing heights,
4.  Atmospheric stability-determines the extent of plume spread or dispersion in the
vertical and horizontal directions, and
5.  Mixing height-determines the maximum vertical extent or volume of air in which the
plume can disperse.
These parameters can be measured directly or inferred from other measured parameters. In
general, surface observations collected at meteorological stations include wind direction, wind
speed, temperature, cloud cover, and cloud ceiling. The wind speed, cloud cover, and cloud
ceiling values are used in the EPA meteorological preprocessor program, RAMMET, to
determine atmospheric stability using the Turner stability scheme (1964). Based on the maximum
aftemoon surface temperature, morning and afternoon mixing heights can be calculated with
radiosonde data (generally collected in the early morning and late afternoon) using the Holzworth
approach (1972). Hourly mixing heights can be derived from the morning and afternoon mixing
heights using the interpolation method developed by EPA (Holzworth, 1972).
The hourly surface and mixing heights are used to develop a sequential series of hourly
meteorological data (i.e., wind direction, wind speed, temperature, stability, and mixing heights).
If the observed hourly wind directions are classified into sectors (such as 10 or 22.5 degrees). the
wind directions can be randomized within each sector using the RAMMET program to account
for the expected variability in air flow.
For this study, maximum impacts from the ISCST3 model were obtained using two separate
meteorological data sets. The first data set consisted of using hourly meteorological data for 1995
from the Gaoqiao hydrological and meteorological station. A comparison of ISCST3 model
requirements to the parameters available from the Gaoqiao station is presented in Table 3.1-4.
Because the meteorological program was based on processing data from the National Weather
Ser-vice (NWS) stations in the United States in specific formats, the RAMMET program was
3-5



9651118C/3-6
05/29/97
modified to process the data as collected, convert parameters into proper units, and assign values
reported at the Gaoqiao station to those that correspond to the values used in RAMMET.
As shown in Table 3.1-4, most of the meteorological data were available at the Gaoqiao station;
however, not all data were available for every hour. As an example, the wind direction and wind
speed data are reported for every hour while the temperature and cloud data are reported at six
hour intervals or four observations per day. Although the temperature and cloud data were not
available for every hour, an interpolation scheme was used to obtain values for the internediate
hours when data were not available. Because these parameters generally do not vary significantly
from hour to hour, values for the intermediate hours were estimated based on a linear relationship
between the values for reported time intervals. For example, if the recorded temperatures for
hours 1 and 7 were 20 and 23 OC, respectively, the values estimated for the intermediate hours of
2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 were 20.5, 21.0, 21.5, 22.0, and 22.5 C, respectively.
Since upper air data were not readily available in a format suitable for direct input to the
RAMMET program, procedures developed by the EPA were used based on wind speed collected
at the Gaoqiao station. Hourly mnixing heights were calculated as follows:
Z4   =   (0.3 x uW ) / f
where   Z,4,  = mixing height, mn
= surface frictional wind speed, mls
= 0.1 x wind speed measured at 1O m
f   = Coriolis force = 2 x (7.29 x 10-) x sin (station latitude, degrees)
= 2 x (7.29 x l0-5) x sin (31.24 degrees)
= 7.56 x 10'
Therefore, the hourly Z4 was estimated to be 396.8 x measured wind speed at the Gaoqiao
station.
The second meteorological data consisted of using 5 years of hourly meteorological data from a
weather station in the United States to ensure that the maximum concentrations predicted with the
Gaoqiao station data were reasonable. Meteorological data from Miami, Florida, were selected
since the wind patterns from this station were similar to those from Gaoqiao and a complete set of
hourly surface and mixing height data were available. Although ambient temperatures are higher
3-6

predicted. For example, if the maximum concentration was predicted along the 90-degree radial
at a distance of 700 m, the refined receptor grid would consist of receptors at the following
locations:
Direction (degrees)     Distance (m)
82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92    600, 700, 800, 900 per direction
94, 96, 98
For SO2, screening analysis concentrations were also predicted at 648 receptors located in a radial
grid centered on the Shidongkou plant. These receptors were located at distances of 500; 1,000;
2,000; 3,000; 4,000; 5,000; 6,000; 7,000; 10,000; 12,000; 14,000; 16,000; 18,000; 20,000;
22,000 and 24,000 m along 36 radials, with each radial spaced at 10-degree intervals. Refined
analyses were not performed for this receptor grid.
3.1.1.3 Air Modelinz Results
Maximum SO, PM10, and NO, impacts are provided for the Waigaoqiao Power Plant for
Phases II and HI. The maximum impacts for Phase II include pollutant emissions from the coal-
fired units for Phase 1 (3 x 400 MW) and the coal-fired units for Phase 11 (2 x 1,000 MW). The
maximum impacts for Phase III includes the emission sources for Phases I and II and the coal-
fired units for Phase m (2 x 1,000 MW). Since inhalable particulate matter is most important
from a human health perspective, inhalable particulates, or particles with an aerodynamic diameter
of 10 microns or less, were modeled. For PM10 impacts, the impacts due to PM10 emissions
from the material-handling operations for all three phases are included.
For SQ2 impacts, the S02 emissions from the coal-fired units at the Sidongkou Power Plant were
modeled with the emissions at the Waigaoqiao Power Plant to determine the effects of the
emissions offset plan.
3.1.1.3.1 Project Only
The maximum SO-, PM10, and NO, impacts predicted for the project only are presented in
Table 3.1-5. The maximum impacts were predicted with the screening grid receptors using
I year of meteorological data from the Gaoqiao meteorological station and 5 years of
meteorological data from Miami. The results show that the maximum impacts for both
3-8



9651118C/3-9
05/29197
meteorological datasets are very similar. The concentrations predicted using the Miami
meteorological data are higher than those predicted using Gaoqiao meteorological data which may
be due to both the precision of the data (i.e., the number of wind directions reported) and
frequency of wind direction. For the 24-hour maximum impacts, Miami meteorological data
predicted on the average 18 percent higher than Gaoqiao, but some predictions were within
5 percent. For the annual average impacts, the Miami data predicted about 55 percent higher,
with the closest prediction being about 2 percent different. The impacts of the plants, without
background concentrations from other sources, are less than the Shanghai Ambient Air Quality
Standards (AAQS) and the World Bank guidelines. As a result, concentrations predicted with the
Gaoqiao data are appropriate in estimating air quality concentrations around the Waigaoqiao
Power Plant.
3.1.1.3.2 Total Air Quality Impacts
The maximum total air quality SO2, PM1O, and NO, impacts predicted for comparison to the
Shanghai ambient air quality standards and World Bank ambient air quality guidelines are
presented in Tables 3.1-6 and 3.1-7. Total air quality impacts were estimated by adding the
maximum concentrations predicted from the modeled sources to a non-modeled background
concentration. The non-modeled background concentration is assumed to be concentrations from
emission sources that were not explicitly modeled. The background concentrations were
developed from air quality monitoring data (see Section 2.1.2.3) and were based on annual
average concentrations. Since PM10 air quality data were not available, the PM10 background
concentrations were assumed to be 60 percent of TSP concentrations.
As shown, the maximum impacts predicted around the Waigaoqiao plant are given in Table 3.1-6
while those around the Sidongkou plant are given in Table 3.1-7. These results were predicted
using refined receptor grids that were based on the maximum concentrations predicted with the
screening grid receptors. Again, impacts were predicted using 1 year of meteorological data from
the Gaoqiao meteorological station and 5 years of meteorological data from Miami. These results
are similar to the results for the proposed project only.
The maximum predicted impacts in the area around the Waigaoqiao power plant when background
concentrations are added are presented in Table 3.1-6. For SO,, the annual average impacts are
less than the Shanghai AAQS, but the 24-hour impacts are predicted to be higher than the AAQS
3-9



9651118C/3-10
05/29/97
primarily due to the addition of background air quality. The background air quality for the 24-
hour averaging time represents the 90th percentile and produces a conservative estimate of
impacts. However, it is unknown what other sources would contribute, and the 90th percentile
provides an appropriate maximum estimate of impacts. The SO2 impacts are predicted to be less
than the currently applicable World Bank guidelines as well as the proposed guidelines (see
Table 1.2-9).
The maximum impacts for inhalable particulates are predicted to be above the Shanghai AAQS;
the impacts would also be above the currently applicable and the proposed World Bank
guidelines. The high particulate load of the Shanghai area is the primary cause of the predicted
exceedances. The maximum impacts due to the plant are a result of material handling activities
and would occur close to the plant, not in the residential areas.
The maximum annual impacts of NO2 are less than the Shanghai AAQS and the World Bank
guidelines. Although 24-hour impacts are predicted to be greater than the Shanghai AAQS,
modeling of 24-hour impacts of NO2 is problematic, since the conversion of NO emitted from the
power plant (i.e., about 90 percent of the emission) to NO2 requires photochemical reactions with
atmospheric ozone. Information on ozone was not available to adjust the modeled results;
however, the impacts of the plant relative to the total concentrations is low and not considered
significant.
Spatial distributions of the maximum total air quality 24-hour and annual average SO2
concentrations predicted for the Phase II Project are shown in Figures 3.1-2 and 3.1-3,
respectively. Similarly, spatial distributions of the maximum total air quality 24-hour and annual
average SO2 concentrations predicted for the Phase III Project are shown in Figures 3.14 and
3.1-5, respectively.
The maximum predicted SO2 impacts in the area around the Sidongkou Power Plant when
background concentrations are added are presented in Table 3.1-7. The annual average impacts
are less than the Shanghai AAQS, but the 24-hour impacts are predicted to be higher than the
AAQS primarily due to background SO, concentrations. It should be noted that both the annual
and 24-hour impacts decrease from Phase I to Phase III. The reason for this is the installation of
another FGD system on Stack No. 2 of Plant 1.
3-10



9651118C/3-11
05129197
3.1.1.3.3 SO,, Impacts With and Without Sidongkou Plant's FGD System
For the Phase II Project, Unit No. 1 at the Sidongkou Power Plant will be equipped with an FGD
system to reduce SO, emissions from Stack No. 1. This reduction in SO emissions is expected to
result in an overall reduction in maximum 24-hour concentrations around the power plant. The
change in mnaximum 24-hour and annual average SO2 concentrations predicted for Stack No. 1 by
adding the FGD system are shown in Figures 3.1-6 and 3.1-7, respectively. Overall, there is a
net reduction in maximum SO2 concentrations in most areas around the power plant site.
Similarly, if the emission units for the Waigaoqiao Power Plant for Phase II are included, there is
a decrease or marginal increase in mnaximum 24-hour and annual average concentrations (see
Figures 3.1-6 and 3.1-7, respectively).
The installation of FGD on Sidongkou Plant 1, Stack No. 1, results in a substantial decrease in
both annual and 24-hour concentrations. Indeed, the decrease in 24-hour concentrations in the
Sidongkou area is almost double the increase in the Waigaoqiao area. The maximum annual
decreases with the installation of the FGD system are slightly less than the maximum impacts with
Phase II of the Waigaoqiao. In the Central Shanghai area, both the annual and 24-hour maximum
concentrations due to Sidongkou and Waigaoqiao are estimated to decrease. The 24-hour
maximum would decrease by about 60 percent while the annual average would decrease by about
20 percent.
3.1.2 NOISE
Noise resulting from human activities can impact the health and welfare of both workers and the
general public. The level of impact is related to the magnitude of noise, which is referred to as
sound pressure level (SPL) with units in decibels (dB). Decibels are calculated as a logarithmic
function of SPL in air to a reference effective pressure, which is considered the hearing threshold,
or:
SPL   20 logl0 (Pe/Po)
where:  Pe = measured effective pressure of sound wave in micropascals (,uPa), and
Po = reference effective pressure of 20 AsPa.
To account for the effect of how the human ear perceives sound pressure, sound pressure level is
adjusted for frequency. This is referred to as A-weighting (dBA). which adjusts measurements

for the approximated response of the human ear to low-frequency SPLs [i.e., below 1,000 hertz
(Hz)] and high-frequency SPLs (i.e., above 1,000 Hz). This section addresses the potential noise
impacts of the project to the surrounding area.
3.1.2.1 Regulations and Criteria
World Bank Guidelines
The World Bank has developed noise guidelines related to annual average sound levels that are
designed to protect public and welfare. These levels are applicable to indoor and outdoor areas
and certain types of land use. The World Bank guidelines correspond to sound levels
recommended by USEPA. These recommendations are discussed in the following section.
Shanthai Municipalitv Noise Standards
The Municipality of Shanghai has adopted noise standards based on the land use of the area. The
area adjacent land use includes Class [I and Class IV Industrial and Highway, respectively. The
Class III Industrial noise standards are 65 dBA for daytime and 55 dBA for nighttirne; the Class
iV Highway noise standards are 70 dBA for daytime and 55 dBA for nighttime.
U.S. Environmental Protection Azencv (USEPA)
USEPA (1974) has developed indoor and outdoor noise criteria for various land uses as a guide
for protecting public health and welfare (see Table 1.2-5). These criteria relate to short-term and
day-night average SPLs. The L, is the equivalent constant SPL that would be equal in sound
energy to the varying SPL over the same time period. The Ld,, is the 24-hour average SPL
calculated for two daily tine periods, i.e., day and night, but has 10 dBA added to nighttime
SPL. The equation for Ldfl is:
Ldi = 10 log 1/24 [15 x 10(Lf10) + 9 X lo(Ln1010/o
where:   Ld = daytime L.q for the period 0700 to 2200 hours, and
Ln = nighttirne Lq for the period 2200 to 0700 hours.
For residential areas, EPA recommends an outdoor Ld, of 55 dBA.

3.1.2.2 Existing and Pronosed Noise Sources
The noise levels and sound power levels associated with the proposed power plants were
calculated using equipment-specific octave band data developed from Edison Electric Institute
(EEI) Electric Power Plant Enviromnental Noise Guide (2nd edition, 1984). The sound power
levels and octave band data for the existing Phase I plant (4 x 300 MW) and Phases II and III
(each 2 x 1,000 MW) configurations are presented in Table 3.1-8. The sound power levels were
adjusted to account for attenuation of plant buildings, equipment enclosures, and the actual
observed noise levels for Phase I with two units operating.
3.1.2.3 Noise Impact MethodoloEr
The impact evaluation of the project was performed using the NOISECALC computer program
(NYDPS, 1986). NOISECALC was developed by the New York State Department of Public
Service and modified by KBN to assist with noise calculations for major power projects. Noise
sources are entered as octave band SPLs. Coordinates, either rectangular or polar, can be
specified by the user.
All noise sources are assumed to be point sources; line sources can be simulated by several point
sources. Sound propagation is calculated by accounting for hemispherical spreading and three
other user-identified attenuation options: atmospheric attenuation, path-specific attenuation and
barrier attenuation. Atmospheric attenuation is calculated using the data specified by the
American National Standard Institute's (ANSI's) method for the calculation of the absorption of
sound by the atmosphere (ANSI, 1978). Path-specific attenuation can be specified to account for
the effects of vegetation, foliage and wind shadow. Directional source characteristics and
reflection can be simulated using path-specific attenuation. Attenuation due to barriers can be
specified by giving the coordinates of the barrier. Barrier attenuation is calculated by assuming
an infinitely long barrier perpendicular to the source-receptor path. Total and A-weighted SPLs
are calculated. Background noise levels can be incorporated into the program and are used to
calculate overall SPLs.
NOISECALC was perforned to predict the maximum noise levels produced by the proposed and
existing noise sources with and without background noise levels. Only atmospheric attenuation
was assumed. The noise impact was determined in a radial pattern around the existing and
proposed facilities.

3.1.2.4 Impact Analysis Results
Figures 3.1-8 . 3.1-9 and 3.1-10 present isopleths of SPLs (given in dBA) that are predicted for
Phase I, Phases I and II, and Phases I, II and III power plant project, respectively. The noise
prediction for Phase I for the western and southern plant boundaries correspond closely to the
data provided by SMEPC and that measured by KBN. The maximum internal plant noise levels
measured by SMEPC and KBN are above 80 dBA north of the boiler and are predicted to be
above 80 dBA in the same general location. The measured noise levels at the western and
southern boundaries were 61-65 dBA and 55-63 dBA, respectively. Predicted vales for Phase I
are 60 dBA and 65 dBA, for the western and southern boundaries respectively. The predicted
noise levels at the southern boundary is about 3 to 5 dBA higher than observed; the predicted
noise levels do not at this time account for the noise barrier provided by the turbine building.
For Phase II, the predicted noise levels are within the World Bank guidelines for industrial land
use areas. While the Shanghai Class HI and Class IV noise standards will be met for daytime
conditions, the nighttime levels of 55 dBA may be exceeded. However, the prediction in this
area is likely high by about 3 to 5 dBA. Moreover, the adjacent land uses are industrial with no
residential development. and these noise levels drop off sharply with distance from the power
plant and the nearest residential areas are more than 1 km away. Indeed, the highway noise was
measured to range from 75 to 85 dBA during the KBN monitoring.
For Phase III, the predicted noise levels are within the World Bank guidelines and Shanghai Class
III daytime standards for industrial land use areas at the southern boundary but may be higher at
the eastern boundary. However, the eastern boundary contains the Zhuyuan sewage discharge
pipeline and other industrial uses. Inpacts to conmmercial and residential areas will not occur.
The Shanghai Class III and Class IV nighttimne noise standards of 55 dBA may be exceeded at
both the eastern and southern boundaries. Again, the prediction in this area is likely high by
about 3 to 5 dBA. Moreover, the adjacent land uses are industrial with no residential
development and these noise levels drop off sharply with distance from the power plant and the
nearest residential areas are more than 1 lan away.
Based on these results, no significant impact to public health and welfare from noise levels is
predicted.

3.1.3 WATER RESOURCES
3.1.3.1 Thermal Discharges
The potential impacts to surface waters (i.e., the Yangtze River) from the Waigaoqiao Power
Plant thermal discharges have been analyzed by several researchers. Most notable of these
previous studies are a physical model simulation of the river the several discharges (East China
Power Design Academy, 1992) and a numnerical, computer model simulation (ECEPDI, 1996).
The findings of these research projects can be summarized as follows:
1.  Thermal discharges from the power plant exhibit dynamic attachment to the Yangtze
River's south bank. The thernal plume may extend up to about 500 m laterally into
the river under lower river velocity conditions (i.e., <0.5 m/s) and typically extend
< 250 m laterally into the river under higher velocity conditions (i.e., > 0.75 mrs);
2.  Given a lateral separation of the intake and discharge structures of 220 m, the thermal
discharge plume typically exhibits a nominal recirculation. As seen in Table 3.1-9,
the recirculation induced temperature rise at the cooling water intakes can be as high
as 0.90C but is typically <0.50C;
3.  The high river velocity profiles (created by both the large freshwater input and
average tidal range of about 2 m) create effective longitudinal mixing and dispersion
conditions. For example, the 3C temperature rise isotherm inscribes an maximum
area of 0.72 km2 under maximum power plant load and mninimum tide conditions.
Using a nominal plume width of 300 m, the resulting mixing zone length is about
2,600 m. A summary of the thermal plume areas for differing isotherms is presented
in Table 3.1-10; and
4.  The Zhuyuan sewage discharge port closest location to the power plant is 1-km
downstream and 1.3-km offshore (from the Phase III intake structure). The lateral
distance from the Yangtze River's south bank results in a maximum temperature rise
at the sewage discharge structure of <0.20C on the flood tide only. During ebb tide,
there is not interaction between the power plant intake and discharge structures and
the sewage treatment port.
The previous studies on the power plant's thermal discharges provide a reasonable definition of
the thernal discharge plume under a variety of developmental stages (i.e., Phase 1, II, and III are
considered separately and in combination) and tidal conditions (i.e., spring, neap, average and
extreme tide conditions). The assessment of the potential surface water impacts from the power
3-15

os/s2997
plant conducted included the following activities to confirm and supplement the previous research
efforts:
I.  A peer review of the physical and numerical modeling studies of the power plant's
discharges;
2.  Analytical computer model runs of the plant's thermal discharges were conducted on a
near field basis and compared to both the previously conducted physical and numerical
model results;
3.  Analytical computer model runs of the potential interactions between the several
power plant cooling water intake and discharge structures and the Zhuyuan sewage
outfall were conducted and compared to the previously conducted physical and
numerical model results; and
4.  A qualitative assessment of the Three Gorges dam (under construction about 1,000 km
upstream of the site) was conducted.
The following discussions address the above assessment tasks.
Phvsical Model Peer Review - The East China Power Design Academy constructed a physical
model to simulate Yangtze River hydrodynamic characteristics and predict thermal plume
movement. The physical model covered the 4.5-km river reach with a 3.0-km partial width (i.e.,
a portion of Yangtze River reach located south of Changxing Island). The model's length scale
was 150:1 and the depth scale was about 100:1. Spot verification of the reported dimensionless
and similitude analyses yielded no discrepancies.
The physical model was calibrated and verified to independent, measured Yangtze River tide data
sets (i.e., one tidal data set was used for the calibration and a separate data set was used for the
verification). The tide data sets included both elevation and velocity data. Visual examination of
the calibration and verification plots show that the tide elevation predictions differ from the
measured values by <0.1 m (over a total tidal ranges of 1.9 m and 3.2 m for the neap and spring
tides, respectively). Visual examination of the calibration and verification plots show that the tide
velocity predictions differ from the measured values by <0.2 m/s (over a range of tidal velocities
of -0.32 mn's to 1. 14 m/s for the neap and spring tides, respectively). Given the tightness of fit
between measured and modeled tide elevations and velocities, the physical model can be described
as both valid and robust.
3-16



9651118C/3-17
OS/29/97
The physical model predictions noted one variance from rigorous modeling protocol. That is, for
the Phase III condition (i.e., maximum plant intake and discharge flow rates) some 'mass" was
lost from the model domain during the spring flood tide conditions. The ECPDA, 1992, report
did not quantify the potential impact of this loss of mass on overall modeling. The potential
impact of this loss of mass to the overall modeling results was evaluated using CORMIX (a
USEPA supported analytical mixing zone model) and transverse mixing algorithms presented in
Fischer et al., 1979. See Appendix F for a description of the models. The results of the loss of
mass evaluation are as follows:
1.    Discharge plume centerline temperature (flood tide) is predicted by CORMIX is
0.45C at a location 1,800 m downstream of the Phase III discharge point (i.e., where
the plume centerline intersects the model's upstream boundary). The CORMIX model
run is presented in Appendix F;
2.    Discharge plume centerline temperatures beyond the model domain (i.e., upstream
distances > 1,800 m) decrease very slowly - for example, at 5,000 m upstream, the
centerline temperature rise is 0.43C;
3.    Given the plume's rapid mixing to near steady-state conditions, the heat "lost" from
the model represents less than 5 percent of the thermal load. Further, when the tide
folds (i.e., changes from flood to ebb) the water temperature at any given location
will be dominated by the near field mixing of the several discharges with only a minor
component of the temperature rise attributable to far field transport; and
4.    Therefore, the loss of mass from the physical model domain during Phase III
simulations is insignificant to the model's overall predictive results.
Numerical Model Peer Review - The ECEPDI (1996) report presents a 2-dimensional, finite
element model that was used to simulate Yangtze River hydrodynamic characteristics and predict
thermal plume movement. The model assumed psuedo-3-dimensional capabilities by introduction
of a boundary layer at approximately 4 m deep. The numerical model covered the 22.4-krn river
reach with a 6.5-km width (i.e., the Yangtze River reach located south of Changxing Island).
The ECEPDI (1996) report does not present model calibration and/or verification data. However,
numerical model results are similar to the physical model results.

9651118C/3-18
05/30/97
Analvtical Model Runs - The CORMX and Fischer et al. (1979) analytical mixing models were
used to spot check several of the key river temperature predictions. Comparisons of the analytical
mixing models to the physical/numerical models are discussed below:
1.    As noted previously, the 3C temperature rise isotherm inscribes an maximum area of
0.72 km2 under maximum power plant load and minimum tide conditions. Using a
nominal plume width of 300 m, the resulting mixing zone length is about 2,600 m.
Table 3.1-11 presents a mixing zone run using maximum discharge conditions and
minimal tide conditions. As seen in the table, the 3C contour line extends nearly
2,500 m downstream and the transverse mixing intrusion width is between 300 and
350 m from the south bank. This analytical model run generally confirms the
physical/numerical model results;
2.    The temperature rise at the cooling water intakes is shown in Table 3.1-9 has a
maximum of about 1C but is generally less than 0.5C and in many cases in the
0.10C to 0.20C range. Table 3.1-11 presents the worst-case discharge conditions
(i.e., maximum discharge with minimum river velocity). As seen in the table, the
predicted water temperature increase at a river bank distance of 200 m is about 1 C
and at a distance of 250 m is about 0.60C. These values agree well with the physical
and numerical model's predicted values with the intake structures located 220 m
offshore from the discharge; and
3.    Tables 3.1-12 and 3.1-13 present analytical mixing zone model runs for less extreme
scenarios (i.e., river flow velocities are normal and discharge volumnes are at either
maximum or reduced). As seen in these tables, the river temperature rise in the
vicinity of the intakes (i.e., about 220 m from shore) are in the 0.1C to 0.2C
range. These values agree reasonably well with the physical and numerical model
predictions.
The analytical model runs are in general agreement with the mixing zone lengths, widths and
temperatures as predicted by the numerical and physical models.
Thermal Plume - The thermal impacts determined by ECPDA, ECEPDI and using CORMIX
were determined to be in good agreement. The maximum extent of the thermal plumes
exceeding 3C isotherm with maximum power plant load is 19 hectares for Phase I, 33 hectares
for Phase I and Phase II and 72 hectares for all phases. Under average flood tide conditions, the
3-18



9651118C/3-19
05/30/97
maximum extent for all phase is about 7.5 hectares. This area is relatively small compared to the
area adjacent to the power plant extending to the coal and ash wharfs and the areal extent of the
Yangtze river directly adjacent to the plant. The area directly adjacent to the plant with plant
structures is about 54 hectares. In contrast, the areal extent of the Yangtze adjacent to the plant is
about 900 hectares.
3.1.3.2 Low-Volume Wastewater
The low-volume wastewater includes regeneration wastes, sewage, oil-contaminated water, boiler
cleaning water, and bottom ash sluice water. The oil contaminated water, boiler cleaning water,
and bottom ash sluice water will be recycled after treatment. The regeneration and sewage
wastewater will be treated to meet the PRC discharge standards (see Section 1.3.3.5) and
discharged with the once-through cooling water to the Yangtze River. The dilution and water
quality of these wastewater will have insignificant impacts to the environment.
3.1.3.3 Ash Yards
The construction and operation of the ash yards are not expected to impact the water quality of
the Yangtze River. The ash yards have been constructed to be hydraulically isolated from the
river through the construction of concrete berms surrounding the area. The bottom areas are
naturally lined with sediment consisting of clays that prevent a hydraulic connection and any
migration of runoff. This separation was observed at the Limin Ash Yard. If ash is disposed of
in the ash yards, the pozzolanic properties of the high-calcium ash would provide a low-
permeability barrier for any leachate to occur. Moreover, the high-calcium content would provide
a high-alkaline environment that would create a condition that would not be favorable to the
mobilization of metals. After completion of each landfill cell or lift, topsoil will be placed over
the compacted ash to minimize water transmission through the ash and provide permanent natural
cover for the ash.
The water quality impacts resulting from the ash yards (i.e., the bottom ash yard adjacent to the
plant and the Limin ash yard) are minimized by the following:
1.    The ash has high calcium (>20 percent) and low sulfite (< 10 percent) contents that
the resulting nature of any leachate formed from the ash will mitigate the mobilization
of trace metals in ash (see Table 1.3-6).
3-19



9651118C/3-20
05/30/97
2.     The ash has possolan properties that when miixed with water and compacted would
form a semi-impermeable barrier mitigating leachate formation. If any leachate is
formed, it would have to be formed under neutral to slightly alkaline conditions that
would mitigate metal mobilization.
3.     The type of construction of the ash yards and using the fine sediments as fill has
resulted in the ash yards being hydraulically isolated from direct contact with the
Yangtze River. Inspection of the ash yards found no evidence of tidal fluctuation.
The species found in the ash yards also suggest the major contribution of water is
from rainwater and not infiltration from the Yangtze River or groundwater.
4.     If leachate is formed in the ash yards, the hydraulic gradient is toward the Yangtze
River. The river flow are so large and toward the sea that any leachate would be
quickly diluted and any impacts are considered insignificant.
3.1.3.4 River Stratification
Several issues related to the plant's discharges can manifest only if the Yangtze River is stratified
(e.g., interactions between the various intake and discharge structures, increased size of the
thermal plume, etc.). The Yangtze River estuary is classified as "mixed", that is, a portion of the
time it is completely mixed and a portion of the time it exhibits some stratification. Estuary
stratification can be determined by its Richardson number (Fischer et al., 1979). The Richardson
number is defined as follows:
Ri = [(Ap/p)gQ]I(WU3)
where:  R, = Richardson Number (dimensionless)
p = density (glm3)
g = gravity (mis2)
Q = freshwater flow (m3/s)
W = channel Width (m)
U = rms tidal velocity (mn/s)
For small R, values (i.e., <0.08), a well mixed estuary can be expected. For large g values
(i.e., >0.8), a strongly stratified estuary can be expected.  Transition from a well-mixed to a
strongly stratified estuary occurs in the range 0.08 < R, < 0.8.
For the Yangtze River near the power plant site, the Ri values fluctuate as follows:

Mean Tidal Velocity
Tide                 (m/s)                  R,               Stratification
Neap                 0.55                  0.47               Transitional
Mean                  0.71                 0.22               Transitional
Spring                0.99                  0.08              Well Mixed
97%                  1.11                  0.06              Well Mixed
As seen in the above calculations, the Yangtze River estuary exhibits transitional stratification
(i.e., weak stratification) for the neap and mean tides but is well mixed with the spring and
extreme high tides. As such, treatment of the estuary as a 2-dimensional system is valid under
most normal tide conditions. Further, since the relationship is more sensitive to the river's width
and flow velocity rather than freshwater inflow, modifications to the river's hydrologic cycle due
to construction of the Three Gorges Dam will not significantly affect the mixing characteristics of
the estuary near the power plant site.
3.2 ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT
The impact of constructing Phase II and Phase III of the Waigaoqiao Power Plant is expected to
be minimal on the ecology, since the area has been impacted previously, and no significant
habitats exist. The major potential impact for the bottom ash area is the removal of the
introduced agricultural and wetland area created from the Yangtze River. This habitat provides
locally useful grazing area and shrimp harvesting for local farmers. Use of the area for bottom
ash disposal would prohibit these alternative uses.
Potential impacts during plant operation are primnarily due to the thermal discharge. The results
indicate that a delta T of +3.0C will occur over an area of approximately 72 ha during peak
operation and minimum flow conditions. During the summer temperature maxima of 29.4 to
31.0C (July-September), the resulting mnaximum temperature within this zone will be 34C.
Using the T,,, method, this indicates an exceedance of allowable temperatures will occur within
this area. For example:
T,l,  =OT + (URLT-OT)/3
where:    OT= ideal temperature for reproduction and growth,
URLT = ultimate recipient lethal temperature, and
T,.x = maximum allowable temperature.
3-21



9651118C/3-22
05130/97
The OT for most aquatic organisms of temperate and tropical zones falls within 28 to 29C, with
lethal deaths around 38C. During summner months, a conservatively calculated T,n value within
the 72-ha area would be:
31C (i.e., ambient); plus
Temperature rise of 3C
38C (i.e. URLT) less 28C (i.e., OT) = 10C
T=,, = 100C/3 + OT = 31.33C
An exceedance of T. of 34 - 31.33 = 2.67C will occasionally occur during the summer
months under minimum tide conditions and maximum power production for all phases. Since the
area is used only in a transit corridor by motile estuarine species and hence does not represent a
nursery zone of long-term residence for early life stages (Shanghai Academy of Sciences, 1997),
there should be relatively little impact on estuarine productivity as a function of transitory high
temperatures, and hence low impact on the local artesenal fishery productivity. Moreover, the
areal extent of the maximum thermal plume is small compared to the river area. In any event a
temperature elevation of 3C is not great if other water quality parameters do not vary at the
same time). Furthermore, and as stated above, tidal and current velocities are such that exposure
will be transitory, no benthic conmmunities (i.e. sessile) of significance exist in the area , so
overall impact should be minimal.
The potential for impingment was evaluated based on an inspection of the traveling screens and
discussions with Phase I plant personnel. Very few aquatic species are impinged o the intake
screens over the course of the early stages of operation of Phase 1. Indeed, more anthropogenetic
generated debris are collected (plastic bags, paper, etc.). Taken together the nature of the river
near Waigaoqiao and the observation from Phase I operation, indicate that impingment impacts
will be minimal.
The free chlorine residual chlorine is kept to 0.1 ppm or less which would mitigate impacts. The
World Bank guideline is 0.2 ppm.
The impacts of converting the littoral zone of the Yangtze River for ash yards is considered
minimal. In the area designated for ash disposal is sirmilar to that near the plant site and is
characterized as highly channelized with strong currents and little structural habitat. These
3-22



9651118C/3-23
05/29/97
attributes, along with the lack of any nursery areas in the area, provide an area which will not be
significantly impacted by the alternate use. Indeed, the artificial habitat created by the
construction of Lirnin Ash Yard for Phase I is used for agricultural purposes (refer to
Section 2.2.1).
3.3 SOCIAL AND CULTURAL
3.3.1 CHANGES TO LAND USE
There are no formal land zoning requirements for Shanghai municipality. Land allocation and the
associated planning is the responsibility of the Shanghai Municipal Planning Bureau. Shanghai
municipal government, with support from Beijing, has engaged in an ambitious development plan
to assist greater Shanghai to accommodate the economic and social pressures that have
accompanied rapid development. The Pudong New Area has been designated as a critical part of
the development plan.
The allocation of the site for power development does not violate local or provincial land use or
zoning procedures. Although portions of the site were once used for agricultural production (see
Table 3.3-1 for estimates of crop loss), the relatively small area required for the power plant was
not considered to adversely affect agricultural production as a whole throughout the region or
within the larger area under agricultural production further form the facility.
As noted previously, during public meetings at which villagers were briefed on development of
the power plant and associated impacts, villagers viewed the change in land use as positive and
anticipate the station to have a positive impact on their quality of life.
3.3.2 RESETTLEMENT
The project will require the acquisition of approximately 74 ha of land, located in the vicinity of
Yancang and Zhuyuamn Villages in Gaodong Town, Pudong. As a result of the project,
274 households, 13 township enterprises, 4 state-owned enterprises, and 6 public structures will
need to be relocated. Table 3.3-2 shows a summary of land acquisition for the project.
Tables 3.3-3 and 3.3-4 show the number of structures and number of persons potentially affected
by the project.

9651118C/3-24
05/29/97
In January 1997, a Resettlement Action Plan for Shanghai Waigaoqiao Thermal Power Project
was drafted in strict accordance with the World Bank's Operational Directive (OD) 4.30 on
Involuntary Resettlement and the relevant laws and regulations of PRC and Shanghai. An
overview of the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) is provided in Section 5.4.
Villagers are generally favorable toward moving to the newly constructed housing units since they
offer the advantages of indoor plumbing, contained sewage disposal, and a steady electricity
source. In addition, the PRC and Shanghai governments require that all displaced persons be
placed in gainfully employed positions and trained for these positions if necessary. SMEPC has
committed to carrying out this requirement for all displaced persons.
No resettlement will be required for the construction of the additional 500-kV transmission line.
3.3.3 DEMOGRAPHIC/EMPLOYMENT/ECONOMIC IMPACTS
During construction, the labor force will increase to 2,500 workers. During construction,
technically skilled workers and laborers will be hired from the Shanghai and its vicinity.
Similarly, during operation, workers at the facility will come from greater Shanghai and will not
inhabit the site on a permanent basis. Local villages already possess an infrastructure to
accommodate increased demand of induced or secondary development. Moreover, PRC laws and
regulations regarding land ownership and inhibition make the likelihood of significant induced
development and hence significant spontaneous development unlikely.
The project will entail moving an agricultural population to an urban area, with concomitant
changes in lifestyle. Improvements to the lives of potentially affected persons (PAPs) will be
observed in terms of residential conditions, education, cultural and entertaimnent facilities. etc.
More importantly. the PAPs can enjoy such welfare systems as medical care and old-age service.
which are much more developed in urban areas than in agricultural areas.
The expansion of the Waigaoqiao Power Project is expected to have a positive impact on local
economnics through increased employment during construction, increased economic activity
associated with an increase in support services to the facility and its workers, and improved
electricity access for the Pudong New Area and greater Shanghai.

3.3.4 TRANSPORTATION IlPACTS
ECEPDI (1996) conducted a study of the potential risks of increased shipping of coal to the
Waigaoqiao plant. Coal will be transported from Qinhuangdao Port in Hebei Province to the site
on 35,000 ton shallow-draft coal ships. Currently, the traffic in the Yangtze River for ships
above 10,000 tons is 34 ships/day; for ships below 10,000 tons is 137 ships/day. In the year
2001, ship traffic in the Yangtze is expected to be 56 ships/day for 10,000 tons and above
capacity ships and 231 ships/day for ships with capacities below 10,000 tons. For Phase I, II and
m the average annual ship traffic is 0.26, 0.4 and 0.4 ships/day. Phase I and II will have 0.66
ships/day while all phases will have 1.04 ships/day. While the Yangtze is almost 5 kilometers
across, large ships must enter the harbor with the tides. During the in-coming tide large ships
enter the harbor while on the out-going tide ships leave. Historical records suggest that ship
accidents occur during this tidal cycle. An analysis by ECEPDI indicate a current accident
occurrence of 5.12 per 10,000 transports and a projected accident occurrence is 5.32 per 10,000
transports. While a 3.9 percent increase in accident occurrence may be associated with the
Waigaoqiao plant, the overall predicted rate of 5.32 per 10,000 transports is low compared to
similar harbor.
The expansion of Pudong New Area and in greater Shanghai has resulted in a network of road,
waterway, and rail transport adequate for the previously discussed transportation needs of the
facility. As a result, no significant adverse impacts associated with transport of supplies or
personnel to Waigaoqiao either during construction or operation are anticipated.
3.3.5 CULTURAL RESOURCES
As noted previously, the project site is not considered protected since no resources of cultural or
archaeological significance are known to exist in the project vicinity.
3.3.6 INDIGENOUS PEOPLES
No adverse impacts to indigenous or tribal populations will occur as a result of the facility since
none currently exist in the project area. As noted previously, the villages surrounding the power
plant vicinity are inhabited exclusively by families who, in most cases, have inhabited the area for
generations.

3.3.7 OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY
3.3.7.1 Power Plant Safety and Health Background
Efficiency and safety in electrical power plants can be greatly increased by careful planning of the
design, location and layout of the facility. Injuries, illnesses, fires and possible explosions can be
prevented if appropriate measures are taken in the early stages of design. Factors typically
considered are nature of processes involved, design of the primary structures, and the type of
system equipment to be used.
The generation of electrical power involves the burning of coal, which produces steam. The
steam is then used to drive turbines to produce electricity. Although process hazards involved in
the production of the electricity exist, numerous support functions subject workers to hazards
which result in the majority of industrial accidents.
Occupational Safety and Health Issues
The safety and health issues found in a coal-fired power plants are grouped into two categories.
These categories are process related and those incidental to the generation of electricity.
Process Hazards
The principle hazards of boiler furnaces and their associated fuel supplies, pipes, ducts, and fans
are fires and explosions.
Variations in the size distribution of raw coal may cause erratic or uncontrolled feeding of coal
into pulverizers. Coal may contain debris such as metal, wood, or rock which may cause coal
feeding interruptions or become a source of ignition. Since coal can form an explosive mixture
when airborne, an explosive mixture will likely develop if a momentary flameout occurs.
Pulverizers themselves are potential sources for fires and explosions. Fires may occur from
spontaneous combustion or the feeding of burning coal directly into the pulverizer. Airborne coal
dust will explode if the mixture exceeds 12.7 grams per cubic meter (glm3). A special hazard is
the presence of methane gas that may be released from recently pulverized coal and may
accurnulate in confmed spaces.
3-26



9651118C/3-27
05/29/97
Hydrogen will likely be used as a cooling agent for the steam turbines. Hydrogen is extremely
explosive and appropriate precautions must be implemented.
Gaseous chlorine, which is extremely hazardous, is used as an cooling water biocide. For
Phase I, chlorine in 1-ton cylinders is used in an inclosed building with an automated mixing
system and an chlorine gas control discharge system in the event of a leak.
Installation and maintenance of safety devices to prevent over pressurization of boiler tubing is
critical for the protection of employees and equipment.
Electrical power generation and transmission poses a hazard to workers. High voltage may be
encountered at the turbine generators, transmission substations and associated wiring.
Incidental Safety and Health Hazards
Hazards incidental to the process but occurring as a result of process operations include;
1.  Exposure to boiler feedwater chemical,
2.  Heat stress,
3.  Exposure to hot steam lines and equipment, and
4.  Handling and disposal of ash.
Additional safety and health hazards to be considered as part of the operation of an electrical
power plant include the following;
1.  Working surfaces (such as floors, platforns, ladders, stairs, etc.),
2.  Emergency exit placement and maintenance,
3.  High noise exposure,
4.  Chemical exposure (including incidental use materials for maintenance, etc.),
5.  Handling of flammable and combustible materials,
6.  Exposures to hazards of working in confined spaces (boilers, vessels, sewers, etc.),
7.  Control of hazardous energy (accidental startup of systems and equipment).
8.  Fire prevention and protection.
9.  Materials handling and storage.
10. Machine and equipment mechanical guarding,

OS/29/97
11. Biohazards. and
12. Ergonomic design and operation of workstations.
3.3.7.2 ReouJatorv Framework
In the case of the Waigaoqiao Power Plant, occupational safety and health standards are
promulgated by PRC and implemented by the SMEPC to assure worker protection. Occupational
health and safety is covered by both municipal and national law in the PRC. The development of
specific standards is a sectoral obligation. These standards are described in the Safety Manual for
the Operation of Electric Power Plants and are grouped in the following classifications.
1. Airborne dust and toxic particulate protection,
2.  Protection against poisons,
3.  Protection against occupational illnesses, and
4.  Protection against radioisotopes.
The majority of the available standards are directed towards female workers in the workplace.
The standards published by PRC are focused primarily on the identification and control of hazards
which can cause occupational illness. Of particular note is the special emphasis on the female
workforce.
3.3.7.3 Waigaopiao Project
A safety manual has been developed and training implemented by the management of the
Waigaoqiao Plant. The Phase I project as well as future phases will include design features for
the protection of workers. Typical hazards expeCted to be encountered, such as fire, dust and
poison exposures, moving equipment and other safety hazards are addressed.
A series of occupational hazard descriptions are included in the training and commitments by
SMEPC management have been made to adhere to sector work safety policy recommendations.
Specific reference is made to the following:
l.  Fire prevention, including the incorporation of fire access lanes, alarms, and reduction
of flammable gas into the project design.
2. Prevention of poisoning, dust inhalation, and chemical injury, including the
incorporation of measures to ventilate adequately, and install chemical leak alarms.
3-28



9651118C/3-29
OS/29197
3.  Prevention of electric shock by following the Electric Technical Design Code for
Machinery during installation.
4.  Prevention of mechanical injury by shielding moving parts, especially rotating
machinery and conveyor belts, by assuring adequate lighting, and implementing
hardhat rules for workers in hazardous areas.
5.  Prevention of thermal stress by providing air-conditioning, space heating or adequate
ventilation in buildings.
6.  Prevention of noise injuries by following noise limit standards for specific equipment,
providing insulating covers for noisy machinery such as steam turbines, crushers,
providing mufflers on high-volume air exhausts, and equipping the doors and walls of
work areas with sound-insulating material. Noise limits for new sources according to
the PRC guidelines range from 85 dBA for an 8-hour exposure, to 94 dBA for a
l-hour exposure.
7.  Preventing mnicrowave radiation by observing the PRC Worker Safety standards,
which call for microwave exposure not to exceed a daily aggregate dose of
400 microwaves per square centimeter (mw/CM2), or an average hourly exposure of
50 mw/cm-.
8.  Providing safety education classroom facilities, as well as clinics staffed with medical
personnel.
3.3.7.4 Recommendations
The following items are needed to improve the facility safety and health reliability.
1.  Continued implementation of site specific safe work practices,
2. Continued implementation of a worksite analysis system, and
3.  Continued imnplementation of site specific safety and health training program.
3.4 TRANSMISSION LINE
As part of the Waigaoqiao project, a 500-kV transmission line about 50 km in length will be
constructed (refer to Figure 1.3-1). This section presents an overview of potential impacts of
constructing and operating the transmission line. The corridor for the 500-kV transmission line
has been planned and designed by the Shanghai municipality for more than a decade. Thus, the
potential for impacts has been reduced. SMEPC operated a half-load 500-kV system, with which
3-29



9651118C/3 -30
05/29/97
this proposed project will interconnect. Figure B-15 in Appendix B presents a typical 500-kV
corridor.
3.4.1 CONSTRUCTION EFFECTS
The corridor for the 500-kV transmission line project has been designated as a transmission line
right-of-way (ROW) throughout its length. To the extent SMEPC is able to locate the proposed
transmission line within the designated ROWs, the use of adjacent undisturbed areas will be
minimized during all phases of construction, including ROW clearing, road and pad construction,
and line construction. By utilizing designated ROWs to the greatest extent practicable, the
limitation of all construction activities will also result in a minimization of potential impacts on
hiuman populations, water bodies, archaeological and historic sites, vegetation, and wildlife.
3.4.1.1 Ri!ht-of-Wav Clearin2
Limited additional clearing will be necessary in areas where the designated ROW width is
sufficient for placement of the proposed transmission line. Where necessary, rotary mowers will
be used to clear the ROW of all vegetation to ground level; all srumps will be removed or ground
to 6 inches below ground level. In scrub habitat, clearing will be limited, extending from the
transmission line centerline to the outer conductors and in areas around structure sites. The
remainder of the ROW in scrub habitat will not be cleared except for the removal of trees
exceeding 5 m in height. These trees will be hand cut at the ground line and stumps left in place.
This will create a more open canopy favorable to the development of sun-tolerant species such as
exist in a scrub habitat.
In the event additional clearing in wet areas is needed, restrictive clearing will be employed.
Restrictive clearing will be done by hand, usually with chain saws, or with low-ground-pressure
shear or rotary machines to reduce soil compaction and damage to vegetation. These methods
may be used alone or in combination, as may be necessary for specific sites. Restrictive clearing
will include the removal of vegetation from areas extending from the transmission line centerline
to the outer conductors and in work areas around structure sites. Also, in areas where SMEPC
may need to create access to particular structure sites via access roads rather than a continuous
access road, a path approximately 7 to 8 m wide will be cleared to reach the site from an existing
access road. Removable construction matting may be used in these areas to support equipment.
3-30



9651118C/3-31
05/29/97
3.4.1.2 Road and Pad Construction
Access roads are required to provide efficient and safe ingress and egress to the transmission line
structures for construction and maintenance. Because designated ROWs will be used for the
proposed transmission line, only very limited new access road and pad construction should be
required. Existing roads will be used for the majority of construction and maintenance activities
associated with the proposed transmission line. Access roads will be constructed only in areas
where ingress and egress to the structures would otherwise be unavailable. Where construction of
roads is required in upland areas, soil from both sides of the road surface may be used for fill.
Bulldozers and/or motor graders will be used. In cases where hauled fill is required, the fill will
be spread, compacted, and shaped to the design width and elevation. In wet areas, removable
construction matting or low-ground-pressure equipment will be utilized in place of fill where
practicable; however, fill may be necessary in some isolated wet areas. These methods may be
used alone or in combination as conditions (i.e., soft ground, deep muck, etc.) warrant.
3.4.1.3 Line Construction
Line construction activities will include the placement of foundations, assembly and erection of
structures, and installation of conductors. In those situations where concrete foundations are used
for steel structures, a hole will be excavated using an augering machine. The base section will be
set in place, and concrete or rock backfill will be hauled to the site and placed in the foundation.
Where necessary, steel caisson foundations may be used for steel structures. When used, they
will be vibrated into place with a vibratory hammer suspended from a crane.
These structures will be erected using cranes and support vehicles. Insulators and roller blocks
will be installed following completion of the structures. Standard wire-pulling equipment will be
used to install the conductors and overhead ground wires. Various other pieces of equipment may
be used to perform construction activities.
3.4.1.4 Erosion
Construction activities will be planned to minimnize disturbance to natural ground cover. The use
of construction matting and low-ground-pressure equipment will reduce disturbance to wet areas,
thus minimizing the potential for erosion. Turbidity screens and other erosion control devices
including temporary culverts and/or hay bales may be used. As part of the transmission line
3-31



9651118C/3-32
05/29/97
construction process, disturbed areas will be restored by a variety of methods including soil
grading.
3.4.1.5 Impacts on Water Bodies and Uses
Impacts from transmission line construction on water bodies are expected to be minimal because
the corridor follows designated transmission line ROWs and little, if any, new access road
construction will be needed. The major water body crossed by the corridor is the Huangpu
River. A tall tower design will be used to elevate lines sufficiently to allow shipping access.
Consequently, no effects on navigation are expected from the new transmission line. Because
areas of new construction will be limited, water quality impacts, if any, are expected to be
minimal and will be managed using appropriate sediment and erosion control practices during
construction. These practices may include the use of turbidity screens, hay bales, and other
standard construction practices.
Culverts will be installed as needed under roads to maintain flow and prevent ponding. The need
for fill will be minimized by using existing roads for access for most of the corridor areas. In
areas where new access roads may be needed, finger roads to structure pads will be constructed to
provide access from existing roads wherever practicable.
Disturbance to existing vegetation on channel banks of streams will be avoided wherever
practicable. In the unlikely event that land clearing is needed, impacts will be reduced by leaving
the root mat of trees in place to minimize erosional impacts to water quality.
All water bodies crossed by the corridor will be spanned by the transmission line without the
placement of supporting structures within the water bodies. No bridge construction is anticipated
for new access roads.
3.4.1.6 Changes to Vegetation, Wildlife, and Aquatic Life
Vegetation-The corridor has been selected to follow designated ROWs through areas that are
primarily urbanized and disturbed. Care will be taken in construction through sensitive habitats
so the minimal clearing that may be required for access roads and strucrures will not significantly
impact vegetation. No populations of endangered plants are expected to be adversely affected by
the proposed transmission line.
3-32



9651118C/3 -33
05/29/97
Wildlife-Since the proposed project will not significantly alter existing habitat, it will have only a
minimal impact on wildlife populations. In those small areas where clearing is required, animals
will be temporarily displaced, although it is possible that a few individuals of less mobile species
may be lost. Increased human presence during the construction period could cause animals to
temporarily avoid the immediate area. This avoidance will lessen the animals' exposure to
construction equipment and activities.
Aguatic Life-Aquatic life will not be adversely impacted by construction of the proposed
transmission line. All existing surface water flows will be maintained and water quality will be
protected by the use of erosion control devices during construction. Minimal clearing in wet
areas will result from construction activities associated with the proposed transmission line. No
structures for the proposed transmission line will be placed in open water.
3.4.1.7 Imnact on Human PoDulations
Use of construction equipment may result in temporary noise impacts to residences and businesses
located along the ROW. These impacts will be brief and intermittently spaced due to the nature
of transmission line construction and equipment use. All construction activities will be scheduled
to minimize disturbance.
Clearing and road construction are expected to be minimal because the corridor follows
designated transmission line ROWs. Where the proposed transmission line follows existing public
roads, the construction contractor will follow requirements for traffic control.
In general, because of the temporary nature of the construction process and the relatively short
duration of each phase of construction at any given location, impacts experienced by the human
populations residing or working adjacent to the transmission line will be minor.
The 500-kV ROW has been in the planning phase for more than a decade, with designation made
to avoid resettlement. The municipality of Shanghai has controlled the land use in this area and
no resettlement will be required.

9651118C/3-34
05/29/97
3.4.2 OPERATIONAL EFFECTS
3.4.2.1 Maintenance
Maintenance activities for the 500-kV transmission line will consist of preventative and corrective
measures. Although transmission lines normally require minimal maintenance, SMEPC will
conduct annual inspections to ensure the safe operation of the line. During these annual
inspections, both ROW clearing and access will be inspected. Transmission line conductors,
insulators, etc., will also be inspected.
Maintenance of the ROW will be consistent with the ROW clearing described previously. Using
the same restrictive clearing practices will allow ROW maintenance to be performed while
encouraging the growth of low-growing woody and herbaceous vegetation to the greatest extent
practicable. Care will be taken not to cause unnecessary damage to vegetation. Any vegetation
that may be cut during clearing of the ROW may alternatively be girdled or selectively treated
with herbicides during line maintenance. Girdled or treated vegetation will be allowed to remain
standing to provide habitat and food sources for wildlife; this vegetation would be camouflaged by
the remaining living vegetation.
3.4.2.2 Multiple Uses
Multiple uses within a transmnission line ROW typically can include agricultural operations (e.g.,
grazing, rice, and row crops), controlled landscaping and other activities that do not interfere with
SMEPC use of the ROW for the operation and maintenance of the proposed transmission line. In
areas where the new transmission line will be located either within or immediately adjacent to an
existing transmission line ROW, multiple uses consistent with those currently allowed will
generally be acceptable.
3.4.2.3 Electric and Magnetic Field Effects
Like all electric power lines, the 500-kV transmission line will produce electric and magnetic
fields. The electric field strength is dependent upon the voltage impressed on the transmission
line conductors. The magnetic field strength is a function of the amount of current flowing in the
transmission line. The voltage on a transmission line is held relatively constant (usually within
5 percent), but the current in the conductors varies depending upon the power needs of the
customers ultimately served by a line. Because of these characteristics, the electric field near
3-34



9651118C/3-35
05/29/97
transmission lines is relatively constant over time, but the magnetic field fluctuates depending on
load requirements.
The major cause of variation in electric field strength at various locations along the transmission
line ROW is fluctuation in the height of the conductors above the ground. The conductors are
securely attached to the support structures at the end of each span but sag somewhat between
structures. Consequently, they are usually closest to the ground midway between the structures.
This point halfway between the structures is called midspan. Increases in conductor temperature
resulting from high current in the conductors and from extreme weather conditions result in
temporary elongation of the conductors and additional sag at midspan. The extent to which the
conductors sag is carefully designed to insure that adequate safety clearance is maintained between
the conductors and ground for all extremes of electrical load and weather conditions. Since the
extreme conditions of electrical load and weather conditions are very infrequent, the actual
midspan height of the transmission line conductors is usually considerably higher than their design
minimum rnmidspan clearance. At points other than midspan, the conductors are even higher,
reaching their greatest height above ground at the structures. Directly beneath the transmission
line, the electric field strength is strongly influenced by the conductor height. The electric field is
greatest at the point where the conductors are closest to ground. Consequently, the maximum
electric field occurs at midspan when load and weather conditions cause the transmission line
conductors to sag to their minimum height above ground. At all other times and at all other
locations along the span, the conductors are higher above ground and the electric field is less than
the maximum value. At locations other than those directly beneath the conductors, such as at the
edge of the ROW or beyond, the electric field is less dependent on conductor height and will
increase or decrease only slightly with changing conductor height depending on location, line
design, and other factors.
Magnetic field strength varies depending on load current and on conductor height. The highest
magnetic field occurs at midspan when the current in the transmission line is at its maximum
value and load and existing weather conditions cause the conductors to sag to their minimum
height above the ground. At all other times and at all other locations, the magnetic field will be
considerably less than the maximum. As with electric fields. magnetic fields directly beneath the
transmission line are most strongly dependent on conductor height. At other locations such as at
3-35



9651118C/3-36
05/30/97
the edge of the ROW and beyond, increased conductor height leads to lower magnetic fields, but
the effect is slight.
The electric and magnetic fields of transmission lines operated in the PRC are required to meet a
maximum electric field at the edge of the transmission line ROW of 4 kilovolts per meter (kV/m).
Typical electric field intensities and magnetic field levels near 500-kV transmission lines in the
U.S. are as follows (National lnstitute of Environmental Health/Department of Energy, 1995):
Distance from       Electric Field   Magnetic Field
Transmission Line (m)      (kV/m)       [milliGauss (mG)]
0.0                 7.0              86.7
15                 3.0               29.4
30                  1.0              12.6
61                  0.3               3.2
91                  0.1               1.4
While EMF standards have been set for several states in the U.S., the specific standard varies.
For electric fields, the standards at the edge of the ROW range from I to 3 kV/m while for
magnetic fields the standards range from 150 to 250 mG. The International Commission on Non-
Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) have established guidelines for the general public. The
ICNIRP ROW guideline for continuous exposure is 5 kV/m for electric fields and 1.000 mG for
magnetic fields. Up to 10 kV/m and 10,000 mG are the ICNIRP guidelines for short-term
exposure (i.e., several hours) for the general public. For occupational exposures over an 8 hour
period, the guidelines provide a recommendation of 10 kV and 5,000 mG.
Electric and magnetic field levels vary with the tower design and height of the transmission line
conductors along the span between structures. The design of the line is being conducted by
ECEPDI and will meet the PRC electric field requirement.

9651118GC3-37
05/29/97
3.4.2.4 Corona Effects
The electric field at the surface of transmission line conductors can, under some conditions, result
in localized ionization of the air near the conductors. This phenomenon is called corona. As
explained in the following paragraphs, corona activity at the surface of transmission line
conductors produces low levels of acoustic and radio frequency electric energy which, under some
conditions, can result in audible noise and radio or television interference.
Audible Noise-The primary cause of audible noise on high-voltage transmission lines is corona
resulting from water droplets on the conductors. As a result, rainy weather conditions produce
the highest noise level. The background noise of the falling rain tends to mask the transmission
line noise to some extent. Gap-type discharges on hardware or scintillations on insulators with an
accumulation of salt deposits or certain other foreign particles can also lead to audible noise in
some situations.
During fair weather conditions when the conductors are dry, the audible noise levels produced by
the 500-kV transmission line will be less than normal outdoor ambient noise levels.
Transmission line audible noise will increase when rain, very dense fog, or particulates deposit on
the transmission line conductors. During these conditions, the noise can be elevated and
measured over background noise. However, for rainfall, the sound of falling rain tends to mask
or muffle the intermittent increase in transmission line noise which may occur.
Radio and Television Interference-Electrical noise in the radio frequency range can be produced
by corona on transmission line conductors or by gap discharges on transmission line hardware.
Corona noise is most significant in the lower frequencies such as those used for amplitude
modulation (AM) radio broadcasting. Noise from gap discharges, on the other hand, extends to
very high frequencies and can be a source of interference with television broadcast reception.
Since the 500-kV transmission line will be constructed with state-of-the-art hardware, gap
discharges are not anticipated to occur. Should a gap discharge develop on a damaged. defective,
or improperly installed piece of hardware and lead to interference, the hardware causing the gap
discharge will be located and repaired or replaced.
3-37



9651118C/3-38
05/2/917
Communications systems using frequency modulation (FM), such as FM radio broadcast or
business and public service communications, are not affected by transmission line noise. Systems
using amplitude modulation, such as AM radio and the video (picture) portion of television
broadcasts, can be affected if the broadcast signal strength is weak or the noise level is high, or
both.
During rainy weather, naturally occurring radio interference from atmospheric electricity (static)
increases significantly causing interference with all but the stronger local AM radio stations,
thereby masking any interference from transmission lines. Consequently, interference from
transmission line corona during rain is not a significant concern.
The proposed transmission line will not interfere with cable television, satellite television, or
telephone reception.

4.0 ANALYSIS OF PROJECT ALTERNATIVES
4.1 MANAGEMENT ALTERNATIVES
As described in Section 1.3.1, the present installed capacity of the SEPG is 8,294 MW.
Predicted power load in the Shanghai Municipality is expected to reach 13,750 MW within
8 years, or about 60 percent greater than can be served by current installed capacity. Without an
aggressive campaign of construction, energy shortfalls and load-shedding will occur in Shanghai
within the next 10 years. The "no-project alternative" could worsen this expected shortage and
result in significant social and economic impacts.
Shanghai is comected to the East China Power Grid via a double-circuit 500-kV transmnission
system. The additional thermal power production planned within the East China and Mid-China
Power Pool grids that could be transferred to Shanghai is not sufficient to meet growing demands.
The consumption of power throughout China has increased steadily at a rate of approximately
20 percent per annum since the late 1950s and is expected to continue at double-digit rates over
the next decade. Transfer from other provinces would fall far short of meeting Shanghai's
projected needs.
While demand-side energy conservation would produce benefits, it would be insufficient to keep
up with the projected growth. SMEPC has an active energy conservation plan that entails
adaptation of new, higher efficiency transmission technologies, improved management of
distribution, and adaptation of more energy-efficient heavy equipment in the industrial sector.
Although significant, the savings do not obviate the need for new power plant construction.
SMEPC does not consider postponing the retirement of older units to be feasible. The power
plants scheduled for decommissioning are small units that if kept operational or repowered would
not be sufficient to keep up with demand. Rehabilitation of these units would not offset the
requirement for construction of significant new capacity to meet growth in demand.
4.2 ALTERNATIVE DESIGNS
The alternative designs for the proposed project were considered around the infrastructure existing
a the Waigaoqiao Power Plant site. With deep-water access of coal and sufficient land area
designated for coal-fired steam generating capacity, the focus of alternative designs was on the
4-1



9651118C14-2
4/3/97
specific design of the steam cycle. The evaluation considered domestic subcritical designs to
supercritical imported designs. Subcritical designs operate at main steam conditions of 166 bar
(2,400 psig) throttle pressure and 538C (1,000F) throttle and reheat temperatures. Supercritical
designs operate at main steam conditions of 241 bar (3,500 psig) throttle pressure and 538C
(1,0000F) throttle and reheat temperatures.
The advantage of supercritical unit design is the improvement in steam cycle efficiency. Current
domestic subcritical designs in the range of 300 to 600 MW have heat rates reported in the range
of 8,075 to 8,005 kJ/kWh (LHV basis) while imported supercritical designs have heat rates
ranging from 7,648 to 7,630 kJ/kWh (LHV basis). The improved in overall efficiency for
supercritical designs from subcritical designs ranges from 4.5 to 5.5 percent. The increased
thermal efficiency is attributed to improved steam cycle efficiency while operating at higher main
steam cycle conditions and decreased auxiliary demands.
The increased efficiency of supercritical designs reduced specific coal consumption and reduces
power cost. The capital cost for subcritical designs are about $950/kW while supercritical designs
range from $970/kW for 600-MW units to $875/kW for 1,000-MW units; 900-MW supercritical
units have a capital investment of $885/kW. The operational costs for larger (900- to 1,000-MW)
supercritical units are reduced based on lower coal consumption and lower auxiliary power needs
from subcritical and smaller (600-MW) supercritical units. The larger supercritical units have an
estimated net power cost of $0.375 to 0.372/kWh in contrast to 600-MW supercritical units
which have an estimated cost of $0.0394/kWh. The estimated net power cost for 600-MW
subcritical units is $0.0396/kWh. The larger supercritical units have a 5.4 to 6 percent lower net
power cost than subcritical units. Clearly, the large, 900- to 1,000-MW supercritical designs
have economic advantages for the Waigaoqiao Phase II Power Project.
Large 900- to 1,000-MW supercritical design technology has been demonstrated in terms of
experience, availability and reliability. In the 900- to 1,000-MW range, there are at least
25 supercritical units operating worldwide supplied by the major United States boiler
manufacturers (i.e., Foster Wheeler, Babcock & Wilcox, and ABB-Combustion Engineering).
Unit availability for supercritical designs is reported to be similar to subcritical designs. Average
availability and forced outage rates for supercritical designs for 71 units are 76.15 percent and
18.17 percent, respectively; in contrast to subcritical designs of 76.83 percent and 18.71 percent,
4-2



9651118C/4-3
4/3/97
respectively. The larger 900- to 1,000-MW designs also have favorable operational history.
Equivalent availability for units from 400- to 900-MW classes, ranges from 81.7 percent to
85 percent, respectively, while forced outage rates range from 4.9 to 4.8 percent, respectively.
Supercritical units of 900 to 1,000 MW have been selected for Waigaoqiao Phase II based on
engineering and economic factors. From an environmental standpoint, the proposed designs will
have generally lower environmental effects as the other designs considered. The increased
efficiency results in lower air emissions per kWh generated relative to other designs. The plant
space needs are also reduced.
4.3 WATER SUPPLY AND TREATMENT
The major water uses for the proposed power project will be condenser cooling, service uses
(e.g., boiler makeup and industrial use) and potable uses. Due to the location along the Yangtze
River, the condenser cooling will be a once-through system. The volume of flow in the Yangtze
River at Waigaoqiao is of sufficient to accommodate once-through cooling without significant
effects (see Section 3.1.3) and close-cycle cooling alternatives such as cooling towers are not
necessary. Currently, all large power plants along the Yangtze use once-through cooling.
Service water will also be obtained from the Yangtze River. Other alternatives for service water,
such as groundwater, are unnecessary due to the abundance of high quality water from the
Yangtze. The service water will be pretreated using chemical clarification and settling and
reverse osmosis. Boiler feedwater will be demineralized. The water treatment has been designed
to reduce water use and wastewater discharges via recycling of some process wastewater streams
(e.g., water used in the ash handling system is recycled).
4.4 WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND DISCHARGE
The wastewater treatment and discharge system has been designed for the Waigaoqiao Phase II
power project to minimize impacts. The treatment system will handle all water treatment wastes
through neutralization and sedimentation. Potentially oily wastes generated in equipment washing
operations will go through oil water separators. Water used for bottom ash will be recycled.

4.5 ALTERNATIVE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL TECHNOLOGY
4.5.1 ALTERNATE PM EMISSION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES
4.5.1.1 PM Emission Control Technologies
Combustion of fossil fuels causes emissions of PM, which comprise the non-combustible portion
of the fuel referred to as ash and uncombusted or partially combusted fuel. A portion of this PM,
usually less than 10 percent, is collected in the boiler and its components (economizer and air
preheater). The majority of the PM, greater than 90 percent, is fly ash and is entrained by the
flue gases leaving the boiler. The majority of this fly ash is then collected by the flue gas PM
removal system.
Certain trace metals can also be volatilized in the combustion process. These trace metals either
remain in the gas phase or condense to form small particulate matter. The fraction which
condenses is dependent upon the specific trace metal and the flue gas temperature prior to
emission out the stack. Some trace metals condense onto other particulate matter in the gas
stream and may be collected in the particulate control system. The amount of condensation
depends upon the volatilization properties of the trace metals and the temperature prior to the
particulate control device.
Several different types of PM control devices have been employed at power plants. These include
multicyclones, wet scrubbers, gravel bed filters, ESPs, and fabric filters. ESPs and fabric filters
are the most effective PM control devices currently being successfully applied to fossil-fuel-fired
power plants. PM removal efficiencies of these devices are 90 percent or greater. Both devices
are also highly effective in controlling PMIO emissions. Other technologies, such as mechanical
collectors and wet scrubbers, have not demonstrated equivalent levels of control.
4.5.1.2 Electrostatic Precipitators
In an ESP, a high-voltage electric field is produced to impart an electric charge to the solid
particles in the flue gas stream. The particles are then removed by attraction to oppositely
charged collectors. ESP performance is highly dependent on the electrical characteristics or
resistivity of the PM to be collected.
ESP performance is dependent on a number of factors which influence the resistivity of the PM.
These factors include the PM composition, flue gas characteristics, particle size distribution, and
4-4



9651118C/4-5
4/3/97
PM loading. Since these parameters can vary during normal operation, ESP performance can also
be expected to fluctuate during normal operations. A maintenance program is important to
optimize ESP performance.
4.5.1.3 Fabric Filters
In a fabric filter, PM is removed from the flue gas as it passes through a filter media such as a
nylon, fiberglass, or composition fabric; hence the term "fabric filter." The filters are normally
arranged as a number of "bags", through which the flue gas is directed. Particulate collection
occurs through several mechanisms, including gravitational settling, direct impaction, inertial
impaction, diffusion, and electrostatic attraction. The PM collected on the bags forms a filter
cake, which further improves PM collection efficiency.
As the filter cake continues to build up, the pressure drop through the bags increases. When the
pressure drop reaches a predefined level, the bag is taken offline for cleaning. Various methods
are used to clean the bags in the fabric filter. The three general types of cleaning are shaker
cleaning, pulse-jet cleaning, and reverse-air cleaning. All three types of cleaning methods can
achieve the same low emission rates.
The shaker cleaning is accomplished by taking the bags off-line, shaking the bags of the fabric
filter, and then deflating the bag by inducing a vacuum. The PM collected on the bags is
dislodged and then falls into the collection hoppers at the bottom of the fabric filter.
In the pulse-jet method of cleaning, cleaning is accomplished off-line by directing a short burst of
compressed air inside the filter bags. This burst produces a shock wave which travels down the
length of the bag, dislodging the accumulated dust cake. The collected PM then falls into the
hoppers located below the bags.
In reverse air fabric filters, the PM is collected on the inside of the filter bags. Cleaning is
accomplished by introducing a reverse flow of air through the bags. This causes the bag to
collapse, thereby dislodging the filter cake. The dislodged PM falls into the collection hoppers
for disposal.

4.5.1.4 Proposed PM Control
Emissions of PM from each Phase II unit will be controlled through the use of ESPs. ESP
technology has been demonstrated using Shenfu-Dongshen coal in several SMEPC power plants.
The ESP for the project will be downstream of the air preheaters. The ESP will have a design
control efficiency of 99.3 percent. Typical ESP design parameters are presented below:

4.5.2 ALTERNATIVE SO, EMISSION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES
4.5.2.1 Alternatives For Waigaogiao Phase II
Phase I of the Waigaoqiao was proposed and approved by the municipality of Shanghai to utilize
low-sulfur coal from the Shenfu-Dongshen region of China. While this coal has a sulfur content
of 0.43 percent, the coal also has a high calcium content which in combination reduces emissions
of SO,. When the Waigaoqiao Phase H Power Project was proposed for municipal approval,
regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Environmental Protection (SMBEP) had been
adopted to require the installation of the flue gas desulfurization (FGD) on all new power plants.
Phase H of the Waigaoqiao Power Project will also use coal from the Shenfu-Dongshen region.
While FGD systems can remove up to 95 percent of SO2 emnissions, the capital costs for use on
plants using low-sulfur is less economical than those applied to higher sulfur fuel systems. FGD
systems used with low-sulfur fuels (i.e., less than 1 percent) generally operate at reduced
efficiencies (e.g., 70 percent) and achieve low emissions rates. In contrast, the same emissions
rates can be achieved in higher sulfur fuel systems with increased efficiency (e.g., 90 percent).
For example, the same emission rate of a 70 percent removal FGD system used when firing a
0.5 percent sulfur coal can be achieved in a 90 percent removal in a FGD system using
1.5 percent sulfur coal. Since FGD systems are generally designed based on volume flow of the
combustion gases that would be treated, the capital costs is fixed. Recognizing the economics of
installing FGD on a plant using higher sulfur fuel, SMEPC obtained approval from the SMBEP to
meet the intent of the FGD requirement by retrofitting FGD on two unit of the Sidongkou Power
Plant. The approval by SMBEP had three components:
4-6



9651118C/4-7
4/3/97
1. Phase 11 shall utilize low sulfur coal with a sulfur content of 0.43 percent,
2.  The total SO2 emissions offset by Phase II shall be based 0.43 percent sulfur and used
to calculate emissions transfer to the Sidongkou Power Plant 1, and
3.  An environmental assessment shall be conducted to determine the effects of emission
trading.
The Sidongkou Power Complex consists of two plants: a 4 by 300 MW plant referred as Plant 1
and a 2 by 600 MW plant referred to as Plant 2. Plant I discharges through 2 stacks, one stack
per 2 units. Plant 1 uses a coal with a sulfur content of 1.8 percent. Units I and 2 of Plant I
have a SO, emission of 8 tons/hr with annual emissions estimated at about 53,000 tons. The
Waigaoqiao Phase U Project will emit about 37,000 tons/year based on 6,500 hourslyear
operation at full load. With FGD installed on Plant 1, up to 48,000 tons of S02 would be
removed. Therefore, installation of FGD on Sidongkou Plant 1 Units 1 and 2 would offset the
S02 emissions from Waigaoqiao Phase 11 Project. The type of FGD system installed on
Sidongkou Plant 1, Units 1 and 2 is discussed in the following subsections.
4.5.2.2 Alternative FGD Systems
Flue Gas Desulfurization
Sulfur compounds are produced in boilers firing fossil fuels by the combustion process in which
complete oxidation of the fuel-bound sulfur occurs, forming primarily SO2, with smaller quantities
of sulfur trioxide (SO3). The amount of SQ emissions is directly proportional to the sulfur and
sulfate content in the fuel. Reducing SO2 emissions by boiler modification is not feasible because
combustion processes do not affect S02 emissions. Generally, complete oxidation of sulfur in fuel
is readily achieved before complete combustion of carbon, the most abundant element in fossil
fuel. For pulverized-coal-fired utility boilers, SO2 emission reduction is typically accomplished
by treating the post-combustion flue gas with a flue gas desulfurization (FGD) process.
Standard FGD processes for pulverized-coal-fired boilers are back-end equipment of either the wet
or dry type; these are often referred to as wet and dry scrubbing, respectively. Since the early
1970s, FGD has been used extensively in the United States to control SO2 emissions from coal-
fired power plants. Currently in the United States, there are 148 units, with a capacity of
68,957 MW, that have operating FGD systems. Accumulated experience with FGD systems is
about 1,800 years; experience with individual unit ranges from 3 to 24 years. These systems use
4-7



9651118C/4-8
4/3/97
a wide range of coals with sulfur contents ranging from 0.3 percent to over 5 percent. Design
SO, removal efficiencies range from 25 to 99 percent, with an average of about 84 percent.
Associated design SO, emission rates average 0.56 lb/MMBtu. The majority of FGD experience
is with wet systems. More recently, dry scrubber systems, which have both enviromnental and
economic advantages, have been installed. Currently, there about 20 units (about 7,300 MW)
with operating spray dry type FGD systems.
The following discussion of each potential FGD type includes a description of the technology and
the potential SO2 emissions reduction level.
Wet Scrubbin! Systems
Wet scrubbing is a gaseous and liquid phase reaction process in which the S02 gas is transferred
to the scrubbing liquid under saturated conditions. The wet scrubbing process usually involves a
liquid waste stream and slurry as by-products. Therefore, a wastewater treatment and disposal
system is generally associated with a wet scrubbing system.
Wet scrubbing systems include three different types which are classified by the reagents used in
the scrubbing process. The type of reagent influences the scrubber design, the quantity and type
of wastes produced, and the type of disposal system required. Either sodium-based, calcium-
based, or dual-alkali-based chemicals are used; these systems are referred to as sodium-based, wet
lime/limestone scrubbers, or dual-alkali. Packed towers are used for the sodium-based scrubbing
system, whereas spray towers are commnonly used for the lime/limestone scrubbing system.
The sodium scrubbing systems use either a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or a sodium carbonate
(Na2CO3) wet scrubbing solution to absorb SO2 from the flue gas. Because of the high reactivity
of the sodium alkali sorbent compared to the lime or limestone sorbents, these systems are
characterized by a low liquid-to-gas ratio. The SO2 gas reacts with the hydroxide or carbonate to
form sulfite (e.g., Na2SO3) initially, then sulfate (Na2SO4) with further oxidation. Both sodium
sulfite and sulfate are highly soluble; therefore, the final scrubber effluent is a mixture of sodium
alkaline salt liquor that requires special disposal. Although these sodium-based systems are
capable of achieving greater than 90 percent SO2 reduction, they have not been used commercially
on large utility boilers and therefore are considered unproven.

9651118C/49
4/3/97
The wet scrubbing system that is most widely used for a large-scale S02 removal such as the
proposed project is the calcium-based wet FGD system. It is estimated that approximately
82 percent of the coal-fired capacity in the United States is equipped with this FGD technology.
Depending on whether lime or limestone is used, the S02 reacts with the hydrates or carbonates to
form calcium sulfite (i.e., CaSQ3*'2 H,O) initially, then sulfate (i.e., CaSQ4o2H2O) with further
oxidation. The calcium sulfite or sulfate slurry is insoluble, therefore requiring settling ponds,
separation equipment, and a wastewater treatment facility in order to properly handle the solid by-
product disposal.
The most frequently utilized wet FGD technology is the wet limestone system. The preferred
version of the technology is the spray tower. In this system, a slurry of atomized limnestone is
sprayed into a tall, vertical absorber tower through a series of nozzles. The flue gas enters
usually at the bottom of the tower, passes vertically up through the spray droplets, and exits the
vessel at the top.
The slurry is recirculated through the absorber system. This recirculation increases the scrubbing
utilization of the carbonate reagent. The scrubbing reaction produces calcium sulfite as the by-
product. Many systems oxidize the sulfite into calcium sulfate, which is easier to dewater. A
bleed stream is taken off from the recycled slurry stream to avoid buildup inside the spray tower.
By-products and unreacted reagents in the bleed stream are dewatered using a variety of
equipment including thickeners, centrifuges, and vacuum filters. Dewatering can reduce the water
content in the filtered by-product to as low as 10 to 15 percent by weight. Often, however, the
typical dewatered by-product is 40 to 50 percent by weight.
Several wet scrubbing systems utilize lime rather than limestone as the alkali reagent. Quick lime
(calcium oxide) is slaked with water to form hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide). The slurry of
calcium hydroxide and water is then sprayed into the spray tower. This alternative of using lime
instead of limestone is less attractive economically because the cost of either quick lime or
hydrated lime is much higher than the cost of limestone pebbles. While a limestone system
requires more initial capital costs for auxiliary equipment (i.e., limestone pulverizer, conveyor
and slaker system, etc.), the lower operating cost of the reagent provides a substantial annual
savings. This is especially beneficial for a facility using medium- and high-sulfur coals, where
considerably more reagent chemicals are needed.

4/3/97
In conventional wet limestone FGD systems, several additives have been used to enhance SO2
removal efficiencies. The majority of additives have been used to bring the performance of the
FGD system up to the original performance requirements. Both organic and inorganic additives.
The organic additives include various mixtures of organic acids that include glutaric acid and
succinic acid. Magnesium, added as magnesium-lime has been successfully used to enhance
performance. With the advancement of wet FGD designs, efficiencies of 95 percent can be
achieved by refinements in design including critical elements of absorbers, materials and control
systems. Additives can still play a role but their use is primarily focused on emergency condition
operation, corrosion inhibition, scaling and by-product handling.
Technically, wet scrubbing processes are capable of reducing SO2 emissions with a removal
efficiency of 70 to 95 percent using the wet lime/limestone scrubber system. Theoretically, a
higher efficiency may be achievable by adding adipic acid to the scrubbing liquid because the
reactions between the lime and limnestone with SO2 are more favorable at lower pH levels. The
process control for the wet FGD technology has not advanced precisely enough to confidently
state that performance at one location can be duplicated at another. Margins of allowances must
be applied to the best performances achieved at other plants.
Dry Scrubbing
In a dry FGD process, the flue gas entering the scrubber contacts an atomized slurry of either wet
lime or wet sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) sorbent. The exact mechanisms for the absorption of
gaseous SO2 and the formation of alkaline salts are complex. Overall, the SQ gas reacts with
lime or sodium sorbent to form initially either calcium sulfite (CaSO3*'H20) or sodium sulfite
(Na,SO3). Upon further oxidation or SQO absorption enhanced by the drying process, the sulfite
salts transform into calcium sulfate (CaSO4*2H2O) or sodium sulfate solids. A typical dry
scrubber will use lime as the reagent because it is more readily available than sodium carbonate
and the sodium based reactions produce a soluble by-product that requires special handling.
Lime slurry is injected into the dry scrubber chamber through either rotary atomizers or
pressurized fluid nozzles. Rotary atomizers use centrifugal energy to atomize the slurry. The
slurry is fed to the center of a rapidly rotating disk or wheel where it flows outward to the edge
of the disk. The slurry is atomized as it leaves the surface of the rapidly rotating disk.
4-10



9651118C4-11
4/3/97
Fluid nozzles use kinetic energy to atomize the slurry. High-velocity air or steam is injected into
a slurry stream, breaking the slurry into droplets, which are ejected at near sonic velocities into
the spray drying chamber. Slurry droplets of comparable size can be obtained with both fluid
nozzles and rotary atomizers, minimizing differences in performance due to atomizer type. The
nozzle location relative to the flow, however, can be different depending on the particular design.
The moisture in the lime slurry evaporates and cools the flue gas, and the wet lime absorbs SO2 in
the flue gas and reacts to form pseudo liquid-solid phase salts that are then dried into insoluble
crystals by the thermal effect of the flue gas. The dry scrubber chamber is designed to provide
sufficient contact and residence time to complete this reaction process. The prolonged residence
time in the chamber is typically designed for 10 to 15 seconds. Sufficient contact between the
flue gas and the slurry solution is maintained in the absorber vessel, allowing the absorbing
reactions and the drying process to be completed.
The particulate exiting the dry scrubber contains fly ash, dried calcium salts and dried unreacted
lime. The moisture content of the dried calcium salt leaving the absorber is about 2 to 3 percent,
eventually decreasing to about 1 percent downstream. The simultaneous evaporation and reaction
in the spray drying process increases the moisture and particulate content of the flue gas and
reduces the flue gas temperature.
In the dry scrubber, the amount of water used is optimized to produce an exit stream with "dry"
particulates and gases with no liquid discharge from the scrubber. The flue gas temperature
exiting the dry scrubber is typically 18 to 30F above adiabatic saturation. The "dry" reaction
products and coal fly ash are both removed from the flue gas by a particulate collection device
located downstream of the scrubber. This differs from the wet scrubber system, wherein the
slurry leaving that system must be dewatered at great cost and the gas is cooled to adiabatic
saturation temperature. Moreover, in the wet process, the particulate control devise is located
upstream of the scrubber.
Key design and operating parameters that can significantly affect dry scrubber performance are
reagent-to-sulfur stoichiometric ratio, slurry droplet size, inlet water content, residence time, and
scrubber outlet temperature. An excess amount of lime above the theoretical requirement is
generally fed to the dry scrubber to compensate for mass transfer limitations and incomplete
4-11



9651118C/4-12
4/3/97
mixing. Droplet size affects scrubber performance. Smaller droplet size increases the surface
area for reaction between lime and acid gases and increases the rate of water evaporation. A
longer residence time results in higher chemical reactivities, and the reagent-SO2 reaction occurs
more readily when the lime is wet. The scrubber outlet temperature is controlled by the amount
of water in the slurry. Typically, effective utilization of lime and effective sulfur dioxide removal
occur at temperatures close to adiabatic saturation, but the flue gas temperature must be kept high
enough to ensure that the slurry and reaction products are adequately dried prior to the particulate
collection process.
The dry scrubber is located upstream of the particulate control device, which is either an
electrostatic precipitator (ESP) or a fabric filter (baghouse) system. The baghouse is generally
preferred over the ESP because it provides additional SO2 and acid gas removal. When a
baghouse is used, a layer of porous filter cake is formed on the surface of the filter bags. This
filter cake contains unspent reagent which provides a site for additional flue gas desulfurization
since all flue gases also pass through the filter bags.
Higher removal efficiencies of greater than 90 percent can be achieved by maintaining an optimal
ratio of reagent and SO2 gas and using a fabric filter for particulate removal. Discussions with
dry scrubber FGD vendors indicate that a 93 percent control efficiency is an optimal design for a
dry lime scrubber FGD system in conjunction with a baghouse for low to medium sulfur coal
applications (i.e., up to 1.5 percent sulfur).
Conclusions for FGD System for Sidongkou
The preferred alternative S02 removal for the Sidongkou Plant 1, Units 1 and 2 is the wet
limnestone system. This control technology has been demonstrated extensively and is adaptable for
retrofits. A wet FGD system would utilize readily available limestone and could be installed
downstream of the ESP. The wet limestone FGD system also produces commercial grade gypsurn
which can be used in cement and gypsum board industries. Indeed, the construction industry in
Shanghai is quite large allowing opportunities for gypsum recycling. Removal efficiencies of wet
limestone FGD systems can exceed 95 percent and achieve the offsets required for Waigaoqiao
Phase II. Dry FGD systems are better suited on new units using low sulfur coal and both SO,
and PM removal is accomplished. An economic analysis of wet limestone and dry FGD
conducted by SMEPC for a 300 MW unit. The results indicated that the wet limestone FGD
4-12



9651118C/4-13
4/3/97
system is more economical than a dry FGD system. The annual operating cost was estimated to
be 19.32 million yuan for the wet limestone system and 28.42 million yuan for the dry FGD
system. On a net power generation basis (yuan/kWh), the wet limestone FGD system is
30 percent lower than a dry FGD system.
4.5.3 ALTERNATIVE NO, CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES
Emissions of NO,, are produced by the high temperature reactions of molecular nitrogen and
oxygen in the combustion air and by fuel bound nitrogen with oxygen. The former is referred to
as thermal NO, while the latter is referred to as fuel bound NO,,. The relative amount of each
depends upon the combustion conditions and the arnount of nitrogen in the fuel. Formation of
thermal NO,, depends upon the combustion temperature and becomes rapid above 1,400 C
(2,550 OF). The equations developed by Zeldovich are recognized as the reactions that form
thermal NO,,:
N2+O        -.    NO + N
N+ 02       -     NO + O
N + OH    -       NO + H
The important parameters in thermal NO,, formation are combustion temperatures, gas residence
time, and stoichiometric ratio of fuel and air. Fuel bound NO,,, although usually small compared
to thermal NO,, is more rapidly formed by the nitrogen in the fuel which reacts with combustion
air. Another mechanism for NO,, formation is the reaction of molecular nitrogen with free
hydrogen radicals. This mechanism is known as "prompt NO,," and occurs within the combustion
zone with the following major reactions:
N, + CH     -    HCN + N
N+02   -  NO+H
The contribution of prompt NO,, to overall NO, levels is relatively small. The primary way to
reduce NO, emissions is through either control of the combustion process or by NO, removal
through catalytic or non-catalytic reactions.

4.5.3.1 Combustion Control Technologies
Description of Source (Pulverized-coal-fired Boiler)
Pulverized coal has been burned successfully for many years in large boilers using wall- and
corner-fired burning equipment. Pulverized-coal-fired boiler technology simply aimed at mixing
the coal and combustion air quickly to ensure ignition stability and rapid burnout, as well as
ensuring maximum thermal efficiency. This generally created high flame temperatures in the
boiler and the formation of thermal NO1. The boiler configuration, size, bumers, and operating
practices affected NO, emissions. Conventional pulverized-coal boilers generally use more than
one pulverizer in their basic design. Each pulverizer grinds the coal pellets into small-sized
particles which are then mixed with incoming combustion air and fed to a single burner or a
system of multiple burners. The arrangement of these burners inside the boilers results in three
basic design configurations of commercially available pulverized-coal boilers: wall firing, corner
firing, and down firing. The use of a particular design will vary depending upon the type and
quality of coal.
The wall firing design is used by several burner/boiler manufacturers including Foster-Wheeler,
Babcock & Wilcox, and Riley Stoker. This design configuration uses an array of swirl-stabilized
burners arranged as either front-wall (on a single wall) firing or opposed-wall firing. The corner
(or tangential) firing design is used mainly by ASEA Brown Boveri (ABB)-Combustion
Engineering. Tangential firing bumers are arranged in vertical distribution in the corners of the
furnace. At each vertical level, the burners are directed to form a rotating fireball inside the
furnace. The down firing design is used by both Foster Wheeler (arch-fired units) and Riley
Stoker (Turbo furnace). In this design configuration, burners are arranged on the venturi throat
and fired vertically down (arch-firing) or at an angle (Turbo furnace) into the furnace.
Circular burners typically are used in all early wall firing boilers. The circular burner was
designed to achieve maximum flame stability and carbon burnout in a minimum combustion
volume. Such a design concept was aimed at reducing the boiler cost which is directly
proportional to the size of the boiler; however, the NO1 emission level is relatively high due to
elevated flame temperatures. The high flamne temperatures are produced from the swirling flame
containing at least 20 percent excess air. Non-swirling burners are used in corner-fired and
down-fired designs. These designs produce lower NO, emission levels primarily due to the flame
4-14



9651118C'4-15
4/3/97
stability enhanced by impingement of the adjacent hot flame, a substoichiometric J-shaped flarne,
and a fuel-rich combustion zone, respectively.
Regardless of the design configurations, burner/boiler manufacturers have found that NO,
emission levels are directly related to the total heat release per unit surface area in the furnace.
These boilers were designed with high heat release per surface area that produced high NO,
emissions.
Development of Combustion Controls
In the early 1970s, NO, emission reductions focused on combustion controls. Such boilers
accounted for a large portion of the total NO, emissions from all major stationary sources.
Burner/boiler manufacturers have developed techniques capable of achieving a factor of three to
four times reduction in NO, emissions compared to pre-NSPS designs. Initially, the primary
design objective for the boiler manufacturers was to lower heat release rate per unit area
(HRRJUA) and thus lower NO, emissions. Both Foster Wheeler and Babcock & Wilcox have
successfully applied this concept into their boiler designs. For example, current boiler designs
lirnited HRRJUA to below 1.75 million British thermal units per hour per square foot
(MMBtu/hr/ft2) compared to a 2.0 MMBtu/hr/ftW for an eafly typical boiler design. By reducing
0.25 MMBtu/hr/ft2, an NO, reduction of between 10 and 30 percent could be achieved. Lower
HRRIUA was also accomplished by operational modifications, such as low excess air, biased
firing, and burners-out-of-service.
Further development of low NO, burners in combination with boiler designs further reduced the
NO. emission levels from pulverized-coal boilers. Some design concepts have been based on an
EPA-sponsored research program performed on a Riley Stoker's distributed mixing burner
(DMB). In this burner, combustion is staged to include two burner zones; a primary burner zone
with a stoichiometry of 70 percent of theoretical air, and a secondary burner zone with a
stoichiometry of 120 percent of theoretical air. In addition to the combustion air staging process,
the DMB design includes a pulverized coal fuel injector along the flame axis, and a secondary air
swirl controller to promote an internal recirculation zone inside the flame.

9651118C/4-16
413197
4.5.3.2 Post-combustion Technologies
NO, emissions can be reduced by promoting the reactions of NQ in the flue gas with specific
reducing agents (i.e., ammonia or urea). These post-combustion treatments of flue gas have been
adopted by European and Japanese utilities in response to NO, control regulations stricter than
those in the United States. For the proposed pulverized-coal boiler, the selective reduction of
NO, methods include the non-catalytic and catalytic processes.
The SNCR process reduces NO, emissions through a reaction of ammonia or urea at high
temperatures (> 1,500 F). For the reaction to take place in utility boilers, ammonia or urea is
injected directly into the boiler, usually in the superheated section. No catalyst is required for the
NO, reduction reaction to occur. Commercially available SNCR processes are either the
NOXOUT process or the Thermal DeNO,.
The SCR process reduces NO, emissions through a reaction between ammonia and NQ that
occurs on the surface of a catalyst located in a 600 to 7500F temperature range portion of the
boiler. This temperature range is achieved between the economizer and air preheater sections of
the boiler. Overseas experiences of SCR on coal-fired boilers include the high-dust, low-dust,
and post-SO2 removal applications. There are several SCR vendors in the United States;
however, most applications have been focused primarily on gas turbines.
In view of coal-fired application, SCR has numerous applications in Japan and European
countries, whereas SNCR's experience on coal-fired boilers is limited to cyclone boilers in
Germany. Between the two technologies, SCR offers potentially higher NO, reduction at a higher
cost than SNCR. There are uncertainties for applying either SNCR or SCR on pulverized-coal-
fired boilers using domestic coals. There is a general lack of operating experience when firing
domestic coals, which are distinct from either Japanese or European fuels.
Selective Catalytic Reduction
The NO, abatement technology for stationary combustion sources that is currently receiving
considerable attention is the SCR process using ammonia injection. The selective reaction of
ammonia with NO in the presence of a catalyst and excess oxygen was discovered by Engelhard
Corporation in 1957. However, the SCR NO, reduction technology was developed in Japan and
used there on a conmnercial basis for the first time. In an SCR process, either anhydrous or
4-16



9651118C/4-1 7
4/3/97
aqueous ammonia is injected into the flue gas upstream of catalysts. The catalysts are arranged in
modules set up into single or multiple stages. For pulverized-coal-fired boilers, the catalyst bed
can be arranged into either a high-dust or low-dust system or a post-flue gas desulfurization
system. The selective reduction reactions occur at temperatures between 600 and 900F on the
surface of the SCR catalysts to produce molecular nitrogen gas and water.
SCR catalysts consist of two types: base metal oxides and zeolite. In an SCR system using a
base metal oxides catalyst, either vanadium or titanium is embedded into a ceramic matrix
structure; the zeolite catalysts are ceramic molecular sieves extruded into modules of honeycomb
shape. All-ceramic zeolite catalysts are durable and less susceptible to catalyst masking or
poisoning than the base metal/ceramic catalyst systems. Catalysts exhibit advantages and
disadvantages in terms of exhaust gas temperatures, ammonia/NO, ratio, and exhaust gas oxygen
concentrations for optimum control. A common disadvantage for all catalyst systems is the
narrow window of temperature between 600 and 900F within which the NO, reduction process
takes place. Operating outside this temperature range results in catastrophic harm to the catalyst
system. Chemical poisoning occurs at lower temperature conditions, while thermal degradation
occurs at higher temperatures plus NO, can be produced at higher temperatures. Reactivity can
only be restored through catalyst replacement.
SCR is theoretically capable of achieving 80 percent NO, reduction from a 0.5 lb/MMBtu level
and can achieve an emission level of 0.17 lb/MMBtu when NO, levels from the boiler are at
about 0.3 lb/MMBtu. SCR is potentially applicable to reduce NO1 emissions from the proposed
pulverized-coal-fired boiler.
4.5.3.3 Conclusions
Based on the estimated NO, emission rate for uncontrolled pulverized-coal-fired boilers using
USEPA Publication AP-42, the NO, emissions rate would exceed the World Bank emission
guideline of 230 ng/Joule by 83.3 percent. The predicted ground level NO, concentrations
support the use of NO, controls. The use of 'low NO," burners in the boilers would achieve
World Bank emnission guidelines as determined by USEPA [New Source Performnance Standards
(NSPS) Part 60 Subpart Da]. The need for post-combustion control technologies does not appear
warranted based on the impacts of NO, and low level of NO, emission that can be achieved with
low-NO, combustion.

4.6 ASH DISPOSAL ALTERNATIVES
4.6.1 ASH HANDLING SYSTEMS
Ash handling may be handled in either dry (pneumatic) or wet (hydraulic) management systems.
The proposed project will utilize dry handling for flyash and wet handling for bottom ash.
Alternatively, flyash may be handled with a wet system. Wet flyash management is advantageous
in that it is less expensive on a capital cost basis. However, the system creates additional waste
liquid streams which require disposal and renders reuse of the ash byproduct difficult. On this
basis, dry management of flyash has been adopted by the Waigaoqiao Phase H Power Project.
The current practice for Phase I is to recycle the ash for use in the cement industry. Fly ash is
transported from the fly ash storage silos into closed cement trucks. Bottom ash is used as
aggregate in construction. This practice is anticipated to continue for Phase H. The pozzolan
properties of the ash make it suitable for continued use in construction.
4.6.2 ASH DISPOSAL SITES
The areas designated for ash disposal have been selected to mitigate impacts. For Phase I,
however these areas have not been used (with the exception of small amounts of bottom ash).
The bottom ash is stored adjacent to the site in a berrned area and if used will be used for a
portion of the Phase III coal pile. The Limin Ash Yard has been designated in a portion of the
Yangtze River with low bottom area and will be used as part of southem boundary for Hangpu
River dredge spoil disposal. While the area is not used for fly ash disposal, it serve as an
alternative wetland habitat that has agricultural uses. Freshwater shrimp (prawn) fishing was
observed in the area and cows were grazing. The isolation from the currents and tides in the
Yangtze River has allowed the development of this wetland habitat which will continued to be
used for agriculture until needed. SMEPC should continue to market the reuse of fly ash to
obviate the need to use the ash yard.
4.6.3 ASH YARD STABILIZATION
If used, the fly ash should be compacted in Limin Ash Yard to reduce infiltration of water.
When compacted, the pozzolan properties of the ash should establish a low permeability barrier
for leachate formation. The low pH for the ash, due to high calcium content, would mitigate the
mobilization of metals.

A comprehensive mitigation and monitoring plan has been developed by SMEPC in conjunction
with other Shanghai municipal agencies to mitigate the environmental impact of the project.
Table 5.0-1 presents a summary of the mitigation plan.
5.1 MITIGATION OF AIR IMPACTS
The proposed development of Phase II of the Waigaoqiao Power Plant includes mitigation in the
form of emissions controls and emissions offsets. For particulate matter (PM) emissions from the
plant, a high-efficiency electrostatic precipitator (ESP) will be installed to reduce PM emissions to
100 mg/Nm3, the currently applicable World Bank guideline for particulate emissions. This
emission rate is more than 2 times lower than that established for Phase I of 261 mg/Nm3. The
Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Environmental Protection has accepted the emissions rate of
100 mg/Nm3 (see Appendix G).
Particulate matter emissions from the coal and ash handling and storage activities will be
controlled through the use of covered conveyors, watering, and air pollution control equipment.
Continued implementation of the dust control program conducted for Phase I should minimize
emissions from general traffic. Bottom ash is slurried with recycled water eliminating dusting
conditions. Fly ash disposed on in an ash yard will be humidified to about 20 percent moisture
reducing the potential for fugitive particulate emissions.
The SO, emissions will be mitigated through the use of low-sulfur coal from Shengfu-Dongshen
mine district. The SO, emissions for Phase II are estimated to be 136.8 TPD, which is lower
than the currently applicable World Bank emissions guideline of 500 TPD and the proposed
World Bank guideline of 300 TPD (for 2,000 MW). The SMBEP requirement for installation of
FGD will be achieved by the installation of wet limestone FGD on two 300-MW units of
Sidongkou Power Plant 1. This plant uses coal with a sulfur content of 1.8 percent and provides
a more economical basis for the installation of FGD. The emissions reduction from Sidongkou
Plant Units 1 and 2 is expected to be about 48,000 tons over current levels. In contrast, the SO,
emissions from Waigaoqiao Phase II will be about 37,000 tons. Therefore, a net reduction of SO,
will result with the proposed strategy.

5/29/97
The air quality impacts also imnprove significantly. Table 5.1-1 presents the SOn air quality
impacts associated with the installation of FGD at the areas on maximum impact and in Central
Shanghai. The maximum increase in SO2 concentrations due to Phase II in the Waigaoqiao area
is 3 and 37 percent of the annual and 24-hour background concentrations. In contrast, the
predicted reductions in the vicinity of the Sidongkou plant with the installation of FGD is about
8 percent and 72 percent, respectively for the annual and 24-hour averaging times. In Central
Shanghai, while some increase will occur due to the Phase II addition to Waigaoqiao, there is an
overall net reduction of about 67 percent for the annual and 40 percent for the 24-hour average.
An added benefit of adding the FGD system to Sidongkou Plant 1, Units 1 and 2, is the
reduction in particulate emissions. A state-of-the-art limestone FGD system with a properly
designed demister can remove virtually all particles above 1 micron. A reduction of 80 percent
for coal generated particulate matter is a conservative estimate of modem FGD systems. For the
Units 1 and 2, a reduction of about 1,600 tonnes per year of particulate can be expected. This
reduction offsets the emissions from Waigaoqiao by about 36 percent.
An additional effect of the addition of FGD on Sidongkou is the reduction in plume rise and
increase in relative impacts due to lowering the exit as temperature. However, the mass flow of
the stack gas is also increased resulting in additional plume momenturn. The overall effect is a
increase in ground-level concentrations by about 60 percent for the same emissions rate. For
particulate and sulfur dioxide, the controls more than offset this effect. For NO., impacts are
sufficiently low for the annual average periods and the NO, contribution to NO2 or ozone levels
are time related, that any increase in the maximum concentrations would not effect air qualitv.
Emissions of NO, will be mitigated through the use of "pollution prevention" technology.
Low-NO, burners capable of reducing NO, emissions to 230 ng/J will be used. This technology,
incorporated into modern boiler designs, reduces the formation of NO, by staging the combustion
process, thus preventing the pollution from occurring.
5.2 MITIGATION OF IMPACTS TO WATER RESOURCES
5.2.1 WATER USE
The Yangtze River will be used for condenser cooling. The plant's location relative to the
Yangtze River's discharge to the East China Sea makes the use of water for cooling and industrial
5-2



9651118C/5-3
5/29197
purposes almost ideal. The average annual freshwater river flow is seaward at a rate of
30,200 m3/s, and maximum plant withdrawal rate is 136 ni ls (i.e., 0.45 percent), all of which is
returned to the river. There are few water users downstream of the plant. The use of Yangtze
River water would not affect potable water availability for the Shanghai Municipality, which
comes from the Huangpu River. The use of once-through cooling reduces the evaporation
compared to other cooling methods (e.g., cooling towers). The evaporation resulting from the
once-through system is also reduced by the relative swift flow and rapid mixing of the discharge
in the Yangtze River. The are no significant ecological resources (e.g., fish breeding areas) in
the area of thermal discharge where impacts could occur, and the thermal mixing zone is
comparatively small.
The industrial water needs for Phase II are reduced by the selection of the treatment system. The
combination of sedimentation, reverse osmosis, and ion exchange is matched to the water quality
of the Yangtze River. Treated wastewater is also used for ash humidification, which reduces raw
water needs. The recycling of water used for bottom ash also reduces water needs.
Potable water is supplied by the Shanghai Municipality for sanitary and consumptive employee
needs and is not used for industrial uses. The projected water uses for Phase I matches raw water
quality to intended use for water. The abundant Yangtze River water is of lower quality and is
used for cooling and industrial use, and the higher quality Shanghai city water is for potable uses
only.
5.2.2 WATER DISCHARGE
The discharge of cooling and treated wastewater will be to the Yangtze River. The wastewater
from process water treatment will be treated using neutralization and sedimentation; oil-separation
will be employed for water that has the potential for oil contamination (e.g., plant washwater).
All wastewater will be treated to meet the PRC discharge standards. The cooling water will be
treated with chlorine for biological control in a manner that minimizes chlorine residue. Treated
wastewater will be discharged with the cooling water at dilutions of greater than 1,000 to 1. The
mixing zone for the cooling discharge is relatively small compared to the river volume.
Other low-volume waste waters such as the oil contaminated water, boiler cleaning wastewater
and bottom ash sluice water will be recycled after treatment.
5-3



9651118C5-4
5/29,97
Rain water in the ash yards will be diverted to the settling basins (e.g., the bottom ash storage
yard and Limin Ash Yard) of sufficient capacity to obviate the need for discharge. Non-contact
rainfall runoff will go to settling ponds prior to discharge.
5.3 MITIGATION FOR ASH DISPOSAL
The mitigation currently applied for ash generated by the Waigaoqiao Power Project is reuse in
the construction industry. The high calcium content of the ash makes it suitable as aggregate and
as an additive in cement and concrete. Indeed, all ash from the current two-unit operation of
Phase I is reused in the construction industries. This mitigation is expected to continue and is
appropriate for Phase nI on the project. To assure the reuse of ash, SMEPC should develop a
management plan for ash reuse and have dedicated staff to implement the reuse plan. Where
possible, alternate uses should be developed (e.g., as a road base aggregate) for potential future
plans. The econoraics favor reuse which avoids disposal costs such as land acquisition, ash yard
construction, handling, and transportation.
If ash disposal is required, the pozzolan properties of the ash may be useful in developing the ash
disposal areas for future reuse. For bottom ash, this may as an extension of the Phase III coal
storage yard; for fly ash, it mnay be commercial or light industrial development. SMEPC should
work closely with the Pudang New Area District to incorporate alternative uses for the ash yard if
developed in the future. Construction of any alternatives should be evaluated against costs. As
each disposal area (i.e., bottom ash and fly ash) is developed, it should also be managed to allow
future mining of ash based on future construction needs.
5.4 RESETTLEMENT
To mitigate impacts associated with resettlement, a Resettlement Action Plan for Shanghai
Waigaoqiao Thermal Power Project (RAP) was drafted in accordance with the World Bank's
Operational Directive (OD) 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement and the relevant laws and
regulations of PRC and Shanghai.  The three principal PRC and Shanghai regulations which
affect the RAP include the following:
I.  The State Land Law (passed by the 16th session of the sixth congress in June 1986
and revised the 5th session of the seventh National Congress in December 1988),
Implementation Regulations of Land Law.
5-4



9651118C/5-5
5/29/97
2.  Regulations of Shanghai on Using Land for Construction (issued from the No. I I
Order by the Shanghai Municipal Govermnent on January 19, 1972).
3.  Implementation Regulations of Shanghai on Management of Housing resettlement
(issued from the No. 38 Order by Shanghai Municipal Government).
These regulations require that individuals must be compensated for loss of land, standing crops,
and resettlement. Formulas for compensation are provided in the provisions under the State Land
Law. Individuals being displaced by the project must be provided jobs and living subsidies must
be arranged for individuals unable to work.
In accordance with World Bank OD 4.30, the RAP includes the following:
Plan Content
Organizational responsibilities
Community Participation and Integration with Host Population
Socioeconomic Survey
Legal framework
Valuation and Compensation for lost Assets
Land Tenure, Acquisition, and Transfer
Access to Training, Employment, Credit
Shelter, Infrastructure, and Social Services, and
Implementation Schedule, Monitoring, and Evaluation
The RAP will be carried out by the Land Planning Bureau of Pudong New Area and Land
Administration of Gaodong Town. A Resettlement Coordinating Group (PRT) composed of
representatives from all institutions and departments involved will be responsible for the
management, coordination, and monitoring of the RAP. Potentially affected persons have
participated throughout the planning phases of the project and will be actively involved in
implementation of the RAP.
Key characteristics and features of the RAP include the following:
1.  The plan has been developed in a manner that ensures smooth resettlement and
rehabilitation of enterprises and residents that are affected by the project.
2.  The plan will be implemented in stages that coincide with the various stages of project
implementation. This ensures that property appraisals and registration account books
are kept as timely as possible.
5-5



9651118C/5-6
5/29/97
3.  Individual's income levels and standard of living will be reassessed one year after
completion of the project to ensure that the goals established in the RAP are achieved.
4.  Affected properties will be compensated based on replacement costs of the property.
Where affected persons are provided replacement properties, the value of the
replacement assets will be equal to or greater than that of the affected assets.
5.  Affected enterprises will be relocated to a location in close proximity to the residential
units of their employees and compensated at replacement cost. Staff and workers will
receive compensation equivalent to full salary during relocation of their enterprises.
6.  Other affected persons will be provided with jobs in nonagricultural sectors. Eligible
elderly will be afforded old-age pension and specially compensated.
7.  The costs to be incurred on land acquisition and resettlement are included in the
overall budget for the project. The total cost of land acquisition and resettlement is
estimated to be 403303740 RMB at 1996 prices.
8.  Workers have a number of employment options under the resettlement plan in
nonagricultural work through township enterprises, state owned enterprises, or new
enterprises. Workers may also create specialized enterprises depending on their
individual skills and training.
9.  Detailed measures and institutional responsibilities are assigned to ensure that rural
laborers and vulnerable groups are provided with gainful employment.
The project has taken all the necessary steps to ensure that persons potentially affected by the
project receive adequate support to relocate their households and maintain or improve their
earning potential. SMEPC and Shanghai authorities are committed to ensure that there is no
decline in standard of living as a result of the resettlement effort. In fact, if implemented
properly, the RAP should ensure that potentially affected persons receive improvement in their
quality of living.
5.5 MONITORING AND TRAINING PROGRAMS
SMEPC has incorporated a comprehensive monitoring program for Phase I of the Waigaoqiao
Power Project which will continue for Phases II and III. The program includes elements to
measure the air, water, ash, and occupational conditions. Initially, monitoring should be
conducted to determine conformance with manufacturers' guarantees provided for the equipment.
The methods for determining contract conformance should be specified prior to their use and be
5-6



9651118C/5-7
5/29/97
based on methodologies recognized as valid and appropriate to measure environmental emissions
and discharges. The monitoring programs recommended for Phases II and m are discussed in the
following paragraphs and summnarized in Table 5.5-1 and Table 5.5-2.
The SMEPC monitoring program includes comprehensive monitoring of both construction and
operational periods. During construction, environmental monitoring of dust emissions, runoff and
solid wastes will be performed. Any construction water discharge will be monitored for pH, total
suspended solids and other parameters depending upon the activities. Noise will be monitored
both on-site and in the surrounding community. Prior to formal commissioning of the Phase II
components, the project construction team will prepare an Acceptance Report on the Completion
of Environrental Protection Installations. The report must detail the environmental designs and
the operational characteristics of each regulated discharge. This report will be submitted to
Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Environmental Protection (SMBEP). SMBEP is responsible for
the review and approval of the environmental protection systems and the determining final
conformance with discharge limnitations. The SMBEP will evaluate all environmental discharges
including air ernissions from each unit, water discharges, noise levels and fugitive dust. Both on-
site and off-site compliance will be determined.
5.5.1 AIR MONITORING
Air monitoring will be conducted for both emissions and ambient air quality. Emission
monitoring will consist of continuous emission monitoring (CEM) and integrated stack
monitoring. CEM systems will be installed for sulfur dioxide, opacity, and nitrogen oxides. The
sulfur dioxide monitoring will determine the effectiveness of S02 reduction through the use of
coal with high calcium content ash and provide a basis to demonstrate conformance with the
SMBEP requirement for offsets from Sidongkou Plant 1, Units 1 and 2. CEM systems will be
installed on the Sidongkou units to manage and optimize the efficiency of the FGD system and
allow comparisons of the SO, emissions offset plan. Such data would also assist in the
implementation of a similar strategy for Phase III (i.e., installation of an FGD system on
Sidongkou Plant 1 Units 3 and 4). Stack monitoring will be conducted for particulate matter.
Stack monitoring will be conducted of the emission discharges from the coal and ash handling
systems.
5-7



9651118C/5-8
5/30/97
The ambient air monitoring system operated by SMBEP would continue to determine overall air
quality in the vicinity of the plant. SMEPC would augment this network with 2 additional
monitoring stations measuring particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide. Locations
of maximum impacts identified in Section 3.1 should be considered as potential monitoring
locations. The monitoring methods would include continuous SO2 and NO, measurements and
integrated PM measurements. Meteorological monitoring and ambient air monitoring stations
would be located at one monitoring station which would allow determination of source attribution
in needed in the future. The overall SMBEP ambient monitoring network and the available
meteorological data are generally adequate for determining regional air quality.
5.5.2 WATER QUALITY MONITORING
Phase I of Waigaoqiao Power Plant has a water quality monitoring program to determine quality
of raw water, service water, and wastewater discharged to the environment. Monitoring of
relevant parameters is conducted on a routine basis at a laboratory located at the plant. Raw
water from the Yangtze River is monitored on a daily basis to determine treatment requirements.
The cooling water discharge is monitored for temperature and residual chlorine as well as periodic
chermical parameters. Wastewater is monitored routinely to determine treatment needs (e.g.,
neutralization requirements) and conformance with effluent criteria. The coal and ash storage
areas are sampled periodically to determine the quality of standing water within the storage areas
and the water quality in adjacent water bodies (i.e., the Yangtze River alongside of ash yards).
Monitoring will continue for Phases II and III.
As described in Section 3.1.3.1 (Thermal Discharges) and Section 3.2 (Ecological Environment),
the thernal discharge will exceed the World Bank guideline of 3C. While impacts are expected
to be minimal, a monitoring program will be developed to assess the ecological impacts. The
program will be developed in conjunction with SMBEP based on input from professionals
knowledgeable of the ecosystem (e.g., Shanghai Academy of Sciences). A thermal monitoring
program protocol should be developed prior to construction of Phase II and implemented to assess
ecological impacts of the thermal plumes before and after Phase 11. The significance of any
ecological impacts should be the basis of mitigating thermal plumes during Phase III development.

5.5.3 OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH MONITORING
SMEPC has a program of training and monitoring for occupational exposures. This program
includes periodic safety training and the use of personnel protection equipment in areas that
warrant safety and exposure precautions. The primary personnel protection measures include
mandatory use of hard hats in all plant equipment areas, hearing protection in areas where noise
could exceed 80 dBA, and dust masks in material handling areas (coal and ash handling and
storage). Periodic noise monitoring in the vicinity of plant equipment and surrounding areas (i.e.,
more than 15 sampling stations) is performed for Phase I to determine noise exposure levels; such
monitoring will continue for Phases n and m.
5.5.4 RESETTLEIENT
5.5.4.1 Trainin_ Associated ith Resettlement
Persons potentially affected by the project will be employed by non-agriculture enterprises and
receive labor training in specific areas required of their new jobs. Training institutes to be
utilized for this purpose include:
I.  The Training School sponsored by the labor administration of Shanghai;
2.  The Prefecture Employment Training Center of the district;
3.  The Village and Township Training Center; and
4.  The Factory Training Center.
The training duration will range from 1 to 3 months, varying in accordance with the nature of the
job. The training centers of the Pudong New Area mainly include:
1.  Labor Management Center Training Institute of Pudong New Area;
2.  The First Training Institute of Pudong New Area; and
3. The Second Training Institute of Pudong New Area.
5.5.4.2 Monitoring and SuDervision Associated with Resettlement
Implementation of land acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation activities will be monitored
regularly to ensure that they are conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Resettlement
Action Plan. Monitoring activities will be two-fold: internal monitoring and independent
monitoring-

5/30/97
Intemnal Monitoring and Supervision
Internal monitoring of the complete resettlement organization shall be undertaken by the CPD and
the PRT to ensure that all the responsible units follow the schedule and comply with the principles
of the RAP.
Indicators associated with resettlement to be monitored during the project include the following:
1.  Payment of Compensation to the PAPs/units.
2.  Allotmnent of house plots. The number of residents allotted with houses at the
scheduled time and the distance between the old and new houses shall be recorded. In
order to compare the conditions of the old and new houses, the houses to be removed
shall be photographed, and those photographs will be kept in the file records of the
project.
3.  Provision of employment to eligible surplus labor within 3 months after land
acquisition. The PAP may select enterprise and will be paid a transitional subsidy
during the job stoppage period.
4.  Rehabilitation of infrastructure and public buildings.
5.  Payment of old-age pension to the eligible PAPs.
6.  Payment of subsidy for the PAPs seeking jobs by themselves.
7.  Allotment of sites for enterprises' resettlement 6 months before construction; payment
of compensation to the affected enterprises for the internal infrastructures and other
facilities, for the loss of salary of the workers of the enterprises to be relocated, and
for the production stoppage due to the project.
Information will be collected from the township/prefecture government and the labor
administrations once every 2 months and compiled in tables. On the basis of such information
collection, a database of monitored data and information will be set up at the CPD and updated
every 2 months. The data collection will be supported by the township/prefecture government.
The internal monitoring report will be prepared every 2 months according to the data and
information obtained from the survey tables. The report will be submitted to the leaders of the
CPD and Local Acquisition Business Affairs Service (LABAS) of Pudong New Area. The
internal monitoring report also will be submitted to the Shanghai Electricity Company and the
World Bank once every 4 months beginning in April 1997.

Independent Monitoring
In order to ensure the effective implementation of the resettlement program, the CPD has
appointed the Economic, Legal and Social Consultancy Center of the Shanghai Academy of Social
Sciences (hereinafter referred to as "the Center") as the independent monitor and appraiser of the
land acquisition, resettlement, and rehabilitation component of the project.
The Center, established in 1980, offers a wide range of experts and scholars, including research
fellows, professors, senior economists, senior accountants, Certified Public Accountants, lawyers,
engineers, and others. The Center was examined and approved by the World Bank and is
considered one of the few domestic consulting institutions authorized to provide technical
assistance to World Bank projects.
A more detailed discussion on the methodology, participants, and indicators associated with
monitoring the effectiveness of the resettlement program is included in the RAP.
5.6 RISK MANAGEMENT
The operation of a power plant, like the Waigaoqiao Phase II Project has risks to the environment
associated with potential hazards. For power plants, these may include oil spills, chlorine leaks,
fires and chemical spills. Inspection of the Phase I operation indicated a dedicated infrastructure
for handling such occurrences. This includes a fire protection systems, chlorine isolation,
detection and venting system, oil spill precautions and cleanup equipment and containment for
chemical spills. For Phase II similar systems are anticipated although not yet designed. A risk
management plan is recommended for Phase II. Elements of the plan should include management
system, process safety information, process hazard analysis, offsite consequence analysis,
operational practices, training, incident investigation, emergency planning and response and
inernal compliance audits.

APPENDIX A
SUMMARY OF CONTACTS - ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
WAIGAOQIAO PHASE II POWER PROJECT
INTRODUCTION
KBN Engineering and Applied Sciences, Inc. (KBN), a Golder Associates Company, assembled a
field team consisting of Mr. Kennard Kosky and Mrs. Jeanne Maltby to conduct a field visit to
Shanghai, Peoples Republic of China from October 24, 1996 through November 3, 1996. Mr.
Shaun Xie, a local Golder Associates employee opening an office in Shanghai, participated in
most of the visits and meetings. The purpose of the field visit was to obtain background
information related to the environmental assessment (EA) being conducted by KBN for the
Shanghai Municipal Electric Power Company's (SMEPC) Waigaoqiao Phase II Power Project.
The EA will be subrnitted to the World Bank as part of a loan program. The EA being conducted
by KBN will utilize much of the analyses performed by the East China Electric Power Design
Institute (ECEPDI). The ECEPDI conducted an environmental assessment for submittal internally
to the Central Government of PRC.
SMEPC REPRESENTATIVES
The major participants from SMEPC included:
1.   Mr. Huang Xim (SMEPC) - responsible for the EA management and planning of the
Waigaoqiao Phase II Project.
2.   Mr. Wang Ji-en (ECEPDI) - engineer responsible for the internal EA.
3.   Ms. Ma Qiong Yun (SMEPC) - engineer at the Waigaoqiao Power Plant working on
environmental matters.
4.   Ms. Ye Xin Fu (SMEPC) - engineer assigned to Waigaoqiao Phase II Project responsible
for environmental matters.
5.   Mr. Yuan Guo (ECEPDI) - manager of the environmental protection departrnent under
which the internal EA was conducted.
SITE VISITS
A site visit of the Waigaoqiao Phase I Power Plant and the areas designated for Phase II
development were conducted. This included documentation of existing facilities and obtaining
information on the environmental performance of the Phase I project. Currently, 2 units of the
I

4x300-MW Phase I Project are operating. Since the Phase II project will relocate about 1,000
persons at a village near the site, a walk-over of the village and an interview of local residents
was made. A noise survey was also conducted.
Two site visits to the ash disposal area for Phase I/II were conducted. The Phase I ash area has
been constructed but is currently not used, since all ash is used for the construction industry. The
visits were performed to conduct a noise survey, performn a walk-over qualitative ecological
survey and conduct an interview with local residents.
A visit to the Sidongkou Power Plant was made to inspect the area where the flue gas
desulfurization (FGD) system will be installed. An interview with the plant manager about the
FGD system was conducted.
A partial wind-shield survey was conducted of the 500-kV transmission line that will be
constructed for Phase II. In addition, an inspection of the type of corridors and structures used
for 500-KV transmission lines was conducted.
MEETINGS WITH GOVERN1ENTAL REPRESENTATTVES
Meetings were conducted with various governmental organizations to obtain informnation for the
EA (other than those with SMEPC and ECEPDI). These included:
Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Environtmental Protection (SMBEP);
Mr. Zhao Bing Kui, Deputy Director
Shanghai Municipal Planning Design Institute;
Mr. Chen Ke Sheng, Vice Director
Shanghai Meteorological Center;
Mr. Xu Suo Zhao, Deputy Director
Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences;

(1) Shen Chensheng (Vice country head of Gaodong Town)
We visit the power plant before noon aad we know that the Phase II Project is going to
be constructed, the villagers pay close attention to it Ihe Phase I Project of the Power Plant is
well managed, and its afforestation is excellent The technology of the Phase II Project is more
advanced, and we believe that it will be better. A lage amount of pre-stage work is expected to
be done before the construction of the Phase II Project. Based on the cooperative experience
during Phase I Project, we shall again posiively coordinate with the Power Plant for construction
of Phase II Project The villagers understand the cument deficiency of electric power in Shnnghai.
We shall support the Project and participate in protectng the benefit of the villagers.
(2) Fang Guoyong (Gaodong Industrial Company)
Inl order to give a steady growth of the local economy, an annual increase of 4000 KVA
is necessary, corresponding to an investment of 60 million RMB- The foreign trade commodities
are incmasing in our country, new enterprises are to be constructed, so there will be ever
increasing in the demand of electricity. In summer, due to the limitation of the power supply, the
production of foreign trade commodities is affected, so we expect early construction and early
commission of Phase II Project, which would obviously benefit us. We shall carry out the work
which should be done well for the sake of the power plant construction and spare no effort to the
coordination by taking the interests of the whole into account

Brief Introduction of Second Phase Project of
Shanghai Wai Gao Qiao Power Plant
l. Forew,ord
The Shaghai Wai Gao Qiao Power Plant is located in the
Pu Dong New Area at the south bank of Yangzi River mouth,
7.5km in the west of Wu Song Mouth of Huang Pu River. The
west neighbour of the Plant is Wai Gao Qiao New Harbour
lkm to the east of the Plant is Shanghai Sewage
Confluence Zhu Yuan Discharge Outlet. South of the plant
is Hai Xu road (outer loop of Shanghai). By the south
side of Hai Xu road is Wai Gao Qiao Bonded Zone. The
Plant is 20km from the city center. See Attachment I.
According to Shanghai Planning Department and Shanghai
Dock Board, the plant area including bank line is from
east to west 1.8km long, from north to south 0.8km wide,
the area occupied is 144 hectares. The total capacity of
Wai. Gao Qiao Power Plant will be 4,800MW. In the first
phase project four 300MW units will be installed, and
will  occupy -47 hectares.  In the remaining area,  four
900MW grade units can be installed.
- The earlier stage work for extension of two 900MW
grade coal-fired generating units in the second. phase of
Wai Gao Qiao Power Plant was started in 1992.
On December 17, 1995. Ministry of Electric- Power
submitted the Project Proposal for the second phase
project to State Planning Commission, endeavouring to
utilize    the   loan   from   international   financing
institutions for construction of two 1,000MW units. State
Planning Commission and Ministry of Finance have agreed
in principle to list the project into the World Bank FY
97 Loan Schedule. According to the electric power
development plan- for the year .2000 and reasonable
constuction period is strived to be started in early 1998,
the. first unit is expected to be put in commission in the
year 2003.
During the overall planning of the first, second and
third Project of Wai Gao Qiao Power Plant, it has been
considered that after completion of the first phase
project, the costruction of the second phase project will
be started successively.

2.Electric Power System
The Shanghai electric power network is an important
part of East China power system including systems of
three provices and one municipality.  It is one of the
main load center of East China electric power network. By
the end of year 1995, in Shanghai electric power network
coal-fired power generation units of a total capacity of
6,828.5MW were running in 13 power plants (among which 8
plants are governed by Shanghai Municipal Electric Power
Bureau) located along the south bank of Yangzi River
mouth, north coast of Hang Zhou Bay and along the bank
line of Huang Pu River. Since the implementantion of
reformation and bpening policy, followed the development
of  industrial  and  agricultural   roduction,  the  power
supply load in Shanghai electric power network is
increasing year by year. In. 1995, the peak load of the
nerwork reached 6,916MW 14% Higher than 1994.
According to the power load forecast,   in the year
2000, the peak load of Shanghai will reach 11,600MW.
Considerring 20% spare capacity, even if the second phase
of Wai Gao Qiao Power Plant were counted in electric
power balance, the hanghai network around the. year 2000
would still lack power. So speeding up the construction
of Wai Gao Qiao second phase project is very important
for relaxing the electric power supply in Shanghai.
Now, Wai Gao Qiao Power Plant first phase project is
under construction. The units are connected to the system
with  220kv  voltage  transmission  lines.  Tatally  10
circuits of outgoing lines are designed, among wihch 7
cirrcuits will be constructed earlier.
The second phase units will be connected to the system
with 500kv transmission lines. The Yang Yang-Yang Gao
500kv line in planning is situated only lkm from the
plant site. So it is considered that this line will be
broken at and looped into the plant site in order to
promote the completion of 500kv ring network in shanghai.
From the power plant to Yang Hang there are two circuits,
to Yang Gao also two circuits.
3. General Plan Layout (See Attachment II)
3.1 Constuction Site

of the first phase project and will occupy 45 hectares.
Now this site is the area used by the- construction unit
and partly farmland.
3.2 Bank line. Navigation. Wharh and Coal Transportation
The front of plant site is close to Yangzi River deep
water, the distance from the -lOm deep water line to the
bank is about 400m. The -lOn deep waterway is already
navigable, the water region condition is good. It is a
good deep water wharf construction zone. The power plant
has already got 1.8km bank line. Three coal unloading
wharfs for 35,000t sea ships, one ash wharf 35,000t sea
ships and three water inlets and three discharge outlets
for the eight unitts can be arranged in this 1.8km bank
line. For the first phase project, one coal unloadinng
wharf for 35,000t sea ships for unloading 5,400,000t of
coal per year, one ash disposal wharf, one water inlet
and discharge outlet have been constructed. The second
phase project will construct one coal unloading wharf for
35,000t sea ships, one more water inlet and discharge
outlet and expand the ash wharf. It is entirely feasible.
The coal unloadinng capacity then will attain 10,800,GOOt,
enough to 8,000,000 to 9,OO0,OOOt of coal per year for
3,OOOMW installed unitts.
The coal for Wai Gao Qiao Power Plant phase II project
is transported by railway from Shen-Fu coal mining area
to Qing Huang Dao Harbour. than by sea shipping via yellow
sea, East China Sea and passes though the new navigation
couse of Chang Jiang Kou to power plant wharf.
3.3 Principler of Genmeal Plan Layout
The priciples considered in the general plan layout
are: the plant site occupied area approved by the
Municipal Planning Department is within 1,800m of bank
line; integrated planning of the second and third phase
coal yard and coal transfer yard; integrated planing of
the second and third phase water intake and discharge
outlet,integrated planning of the second and third phase
coal unloading wharf, ash disposal wharf and coal trasfer
wharf; to reserve the position for oil transfer storage
tank  and  oil  wharf  during planning.  The  location  of
production management and living service facilities for
the power plant has aleady been planned unitarily at the
south-west corner of the plant site, originally the front

area of the plant in first phase project.
The general plan layout shown in Attachment II, the
distance between the second phase main power block is
240m. The auxilliary production structures of the second
and third project will be arranged here. The second phase
500kv distribution equipment will be GIS, arranged at the
east side of grid control building. The desulphurizing
area is reserved at the north side of the chimney.
The second phase coal yard is arranged in an area
between the main power block and river bank, the third
phase coal yard will be located in the slag filled area
and the original coal transfer yard, but the transer yard
function is still reserved.
It is cosidered in the second phase to construct the
third berth of the coal unloading wharf, in the third
phase project the second berth will be extended. The
first phase ash disposal wharf will be utilized for the
second phase. The coal transfer wharf will be kept.
The reserved position for oil transfer storage tank
and oil transfer wharf will be considered at the
extension end of the third phase.
3.4 Coal Bandling System and Layout
The first phase project of Wai Gao Qiao Power Plant
needs 3,000,000t of coal every year. Our government has
arranged Shen fu-Dong Sheng low sulphur excellent power
coal for the plant. The two 900MW grade coal- fired units
constructed  in  the  second  phase  project  will  need
4,800,000t  of  coal.  We  have  already  reported  and
requested our government to arrange also Shen Fu-Dong
Sheng excellent power coal.
Coal is transported by .35,000t sea ships directly to
the power plant coal wharf. The power plant coal yard
storage capacity is designed to be 450,000t, enough to
supply coal for 25 days operation of two 900MW grade
units. To esure safe operation of the power plant, a dry
coal shed will be set up, its storage capacity is enough
for four days, operation of the two 900MW grade unitts.
3.5 Ash Disposal and Ash Tazd
The ash yard of Wai Gao Qiao Power Plant is located at
Yangzi River beach, 14km down stream the plant site. It
is planned to dike 10km of the beach above 0 meter deep
line to form an ash yard. Now the ash yard of the first

phase four 300MW units have been construction. This ash
yard may be extended to down stream according to actual
operating condition and constructed in phases. If it is
needed to further expand the ash storage capacity.
Ash disposal is considered according-to the following
principles: d_y ash discharged in dry state; coarse and
fine ash discharged separately; ash and slag discharged
separately. After being wetted from ash wharf the ash is
transported  by  ships  to  ash *yard,  and  arranged  for
comprehensive utilization and transported by land.
3.6 Water Source Conditioni
The Wai Gao Qiao Power Plant is located at Yangzi
River outlet mouth to the sea, the quantity of water is
abundant,  enough  to  supply  the  power  plant  as  once
through    circulating   cooling   water.    Mathematical
simulating calculation and physical simulating tests of
the temperature  field around the intake and discharge
have been carried out. The answers are the water intake
and  discharge  outlet  temperature  are  well  below  the
control standard.  The living tap water  3,500m3/day is
supplied by local water company and it will be enough for
the first and second phase living water. Other water is
taken from Yangzi River and treated before use. But in
winter due to the back flow of sea water into Yangzi
River, the sodium ion is too high, reverse osmosis device
should be considered in water treatmet system.
4.Construction Schedule
The construction of the second phase project of Wai
Gao Qiao Power Plant is planned to started in 1998, the
first unit and the second unit are planned to be
commissioned  in 2003  and 2004  respectively.  Now, the.
project proposal has been already submitted to State
Planning  Commission,  waiting  for . retification.   The
Feasibility Study Report has been reviewed and approved
by the. Electric Power Planning and Design Institute of
Electric Power.

FUGITIVE DUST EMISSION METHODOLOGY

FUGITIVE PM EMISSION METHODOLOGY
Material-Handling Operations
The material-handling operations include facilities for handling coal and byproducts (bottom and
fly ash) at the Waigaoqiao Power Plant complex. The coal-handling systems for these plants
involve rail delivery, unloading facilities, stockout and reclaim facilities, and active and inactive
storage. Byproduct-handling systems include collection and transfer facilities, silos, and
transportation and storage facilities. Each activity was evaluated to determine fugitive PM/PM10
emissions using the techniques included in this methodology. Materials handled wet (i.e., bottom
ash) do not have fugitive emissions and are not evaluated further.
Fugitive PM Emissions
Fugitive particulate matter (PM) will be emitted from the coal-handling and byproduct-handling
operations. The main fugitive dust sources will include the following:
1.    Coal unloading,
2.    Stockout and reclaim facilities (including conveyors),
3.    Coal crushing facilities, and
4.    Coal storage facilities (active and inactive storage, silos).
Uncontrolled emission factors for the various material-handling operations were estimnated in
accordance with current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) techniques as presented in
AP-42 (EPA, 1994), fugitive dust background document (EPA, 1992), or equipment design
information. Control efficiencies provided by the equipment manufacturer were applied to the
uncontrolled emission factors to develop controlled emission factors.
The fugitive PM/PMIO emissions from the material-handling facilities are controlled using various
techniques which may include enclosures, water sprays, ventilation, and bag filters (or other
devices). These techniques were evaluated at each plant and a control efficiency developed from
information available from SMEPC, emission factors, or engineering judgment.
Batch Drop Operations
Batch drop operations include dropping materials onto a receiving surface, such as a truck
dumping material on a storage pile, or loading out from the pile to a truck using a front-end
E-1

loader. The total suspended particulate matter [PM(TSP)] and PM10 emission factors for batch
drop operations are defined in Section 13.2 of AP-42 by the equation:
E = k(O.0032) (U/5) 3 (lb/ton)
(M/2)'L4
where:   E = emission factor (lb/ton),
k = particle size multiplier,
U = mean wind speed (mph), and
M = material moisture content (percent).
This equation is summarized in Table E-1, and the basic assumptions needed to estimate emissions
are presented in Table E-2. The particle size multiplier, k, was based on the recommended
multipliers of 1.0 and 0.36 in developing the TSP and PM1O emission estimates, respectively.
For exposed operations, the wind speed was estimated from meteorological data available from
the meteorological station at Gaoqiao. For batch drop operations that are enclosed with emissions
vented through a filter device (provided a design flow rate has not been given), an effective wind
speed was developed by assuming that the air flow discharge velocity through the filter is equal to
the formula wind speed. For example, based on typical air flow rates for bag filters, the effective
wind speeds can vary from 11 to 12 mph.
Moisture contents for materials will be required for each batch drop process.
Vehicular Trafric Movement
Vehicular traffic movement is due to truck traffic that is transporting the materials to and from the
plant site. Truck traffic also includes front-end loaders which reclaim materials from storage piles
and maintain storage piles. The emission factors for vehicular traffic on paved and unpaved roads
was derived from Section 13.2 in AP-42. The emission factor for paved roads is:
E = k (sL/2)0-65 (W/3)' 5 (lb/vehicle mile traveled)
where:      E = emission factor (lb/vehicle mile traveled),
k = particle size multiplier,
sL = silt loading (g/m2), and
W = mean vehicle weight (ton).
E-2



9651118CIAPPE-3
12127196
A silt loading rate of 7.2 g/m2 was used. This factor is based on total dust loading and was
developed by KBN from actual dust-loading measurements at a coal-fired power plant. The
amount of silt (i.e., particles with a size less than 75 micrometers) was evaluated.
The emission factor for unpaved roads is:
E = k(5.9)(s/12)(S/30)(W/3)01(w/4)-5[(365-p)/3651(lb/vehicle mile traveled)
where:     E = emaission factor (lb/vehicle mile traveled),
k = particle size multiplier,
s = silt content of surface material (percent),
S = mean vehicle speed (mph),
W = mean vehicle weight (ton),
w = mean number of wheels, and
p = number of days with at least 0.01 inch of precipitation per
year.
These equations are summarized in Table E-3, and the basic assumptions needed to estimate
emissions are presented in Table E-4. For paved roads, the particle size multiplier, k, was based
on the recommended multipliers of 0.082 and 0.016 in developing the TSP and PM1O emission
estimates, respectively. For unpaved roads, k was based on the recommended multipliers of 1.0
and 0.36 in developing the TSP and PM1O emission estimates, respectively. The silt loading rate
was based on representative silt loading rates for this type of facility.
To maximize the 24-hour emissions, precipitation was assumed to be zero. For annual average
ermissions, the number of days with at least 0.01 inch of precipitation per year was obtained from
data collected at the meteorological station at Gaoqiao.
Coal Crushing and Grinding Process
The emnission factor for the coal-crushing process was taken from Section 8.23.2, Table 8.23-1 in
AP42. If the coal has a high moisture content (defmition of high moisture is coal with a
moisture content of 4 percent or more by weight), the PM(TSP) and PM,0 emission factors for
high-moisture coal of 0.02 and 0.009 lb/ton, respectively, were assumed. Otherwise, the
emission factor for low-moisture coal was used. The dust collection equipment used to control
fugitive dust emissions would be the basis of the controlled emission factors.
E-3



9651118CIAPPE-4
12/27196
Storage Piles
For emissions from wind erosion of active (frequently disturbed) storage piles, the emission factor
from continuously active piles, derived from Section 2.3.1.3.3 in EPA's fugitive dust background
document, is:
E = k(1.7)(s1l.5)[(365-p)1365](f/15) (lb/day/acre)
where:      E = emission factor (lb/day/acre),
k = particle size multiplier,
s = silt content of material (percent),
p = number of days with at least 0.01 inch of precipitation per
year, and
f = percent of time that unobstructed wind speed exceeds 12 mph
at the mean pile height.
This equation is summarized in Table E-5, and the basic assumptions needed to estimate ermission
are presented in Table E-6. The particle size multiplier, k, was based on the reconmnended
multipliers of 1.0 and 0.50 in developing the TSP and PMIO emission estimates, respectively.
Again, the silt content was based on a representative silt content for power generation sources.
To maximize the 24-hour ernissions, precipitation was assumed to be zero and the frequency of
the wind speed greater than 12 mph was assumed to be 50 percent or 12 hours in a day (which
occurs approximately 10 percent of the time). For annual average emissions, the number of days
with at least 0.01 inch of precipitation per year and the anmual frequency of wind speeds greater
than 12 mph was obtained from data collected at the meteorological station at Gaoqiao.
Initially, emissions from inactive storage piles was evaluated using the same methodology as that
used to evaluate active storage piles. These emissions was evaluated based on the activities being
performed at each plant.
Other Operations and Considerations
If there is no batch drop associated with the transfer of material (e.g., with the fly ash removal
operation) or a dust collector is the only identified source for an operation, the controlled
emission rate was based on the air flow rate for the dust collector/bag filter and the design PM
emission rate [expressed as the number of grains per actual cubic foot per minute (gr/acfm)].
E-4



9651118C/APPE-5
12127/96
Control efficiencies were applied to any operation that includes a dust suppressant measure (e.g.,
watering).
Because the anticipated hours of material handling may occur over a limited tirne period (e.g., up
to 12 hours in a day), the number of hours during which emissions from these sources may occur
was identified and used to develop emission totals.

ote: The NFR is the zone of strong initial mixing. It has no regulatory
implication. However, this information may be useful for the discharge
designer because the mixing in the NFR is usually sensitive to the
discharge design conditions.

:ioyancy assessment:
The effluent density is less than the surrounding ambient water
density at the discharge level.
Therefore, the effluent is POSITIVELY BUOYANT and will tend to rise towards
the surface.
aar-field instability behavior:
The discharge flow will experience instabilities with full vertical mixing
in the near-field.
There may be benthic impact of high pollutant concentrations.

.xtensive comparison with field and laboratory data has shown that the
CORMIX predictions on dilutions and concentrations (with associated
plume geometries) are reliable for the majority of cases and are accurate
to within about +-50% (standard deviation).
,s a further safeguard, CORMIX will not give predictions whenever it judges
the design configuration as highly complex and uncertain for prediction.
