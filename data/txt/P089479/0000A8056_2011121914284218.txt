                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Mid Term Review completed in August concluded that the project continues to make progress and is likely to meet its Development Objectives. The following progress, challenge
                         and actions were agreed with the Directorate and the Task Team.

                         Impact Evaluation:
                         Midline measurements show increases in development scores for both enrolled and not enrolled children, as compared to baseline. In addition, we find that the enrolled develop
                         faster than the not enrolled on the language and cognitive domains. This is true for both the young cohort (1 year old at baseline) and the older cohort (4 year old at baseline). We do
                         not (yet) find these differences on other domains of early childhood development.

                         Progress of Implementation:
                         In general, after an extensive community facilitation process, 5,990 Community-based Services have been established and are now operating in 3,000 poor villages. Around 12,000
                         village teachers have been trained and provide service to around 497,000 children (as of early 2011) from relatively poor families. The majority of the 50 participating districts (70%)
                         have issued local regulation that support ECED programs in their respective regions, # building a good foundation for sustaining the achievement. Services in batch 1 villages have
                         received their full block grant and will now start relying on other sources of funds.

                         Progress at policy level includes: the expansion of the Directorate's mandate to also cover formal ECD services and the introduction of Operational Fund (BoP) for ECED services by
                         MoNE (starting with 7% coverage in 2011).

                         Progress has also been made, although at slower pace, on Quality Assurance, including the continuing discussion on the operational guidelines for the National Standard, the
                         integration of teacher training/ credential system within the Directorate for Teacher Training and on establishing standard for ECED training provider.

                         Challenges # with actions agreed as part of Annual Work Plan 2011.
                         #         Promoting Sustainability
                         The Directorate has been proactive in assuring the fulfillment of the MoU's for each of the districts # as the basis for sustaining program achievement. The Director visited selected
                         poor-performing districts and raised the issue directly to head of District which prompted immediate action. The Bank proposed several actions by the Directorate: i) arrange official
                         hand-over to districts of services in batch 1 villages (where block grant is fully disbursed) to ensure district support, ii) facilitate districts in collaborating with other village-based
                         programs (eg. Village Fund or PNPM); iii) remind district to maintain community-based/ empowerment aspect of the program by channeling local support as block-grant (not direct
                         salaries to teachers). The Bank strongly supports the launch of operational fund (BoP) programs for ECED.

                         #        Improving service to children aged 0-3 and Parenting Education
                         Centre-based service is not best option for this age group and needs to be done by improving and expanding Parenting education and collaborating with other services (including

                         health post/ Posyandu). The Directorate agreed to: optimize the use of Parenting Booklet and Manuals produced by the Directorate and to incorporate parenting materials in future
                         teacher training. The Bank support the 2012 launch by Directorate of community block grant for Parenting.

                         #         Improving of Technical Support for teacher/ child development workers.
                         The cascade training introduced by the program has produced high quality training materials and a pool of National, Provincial and Master Trainers # who then trained all the village
                         teachers. A series of activities have been agreed in 2011 and 2012 to continue the technical/ professional support to teacher including the production of simplified resources for
                         Master Trainers and village teachers, the use of cluster meetings as learning forums and the use of apprenticeships to update teacher skills as well as involving other potential
                         trainers in the district to broaden the district pools of qualified trainers/ resource people.

                         #       Improved Monitoring System
                         Through a close collaboration between Directorate#s and Bank# teams, the monitoring system has been improved through a data processing program that allows the generation of a

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         #          Promoting Sustainability
                         The Directorate is proactive in reviewing the fulfillment of the MoU for each of the districts # as the basis for sustaining the program achievement. The Director visited selected poor-
                         performing districts and raised the issue directly to head of District which prompted immediate action. The Bank proposed several actions by Directorate: i) arrange official hand-over
                         to districts of services in batch 1 villages (where block grant is fully disbursed) to ensure district support, ii) facilitate districts in collaborating with other village-based program (eg.
                         Village Fund or PNPM); iii) remind district to maintain community-based/ empowerment aspect of the program by channeling local support as block-grants (not direct salaries to
                         teachers). The Bank strongly support the launch of operational fund (BoP) program for ECED.

                         #       Improving service to children aged 0-3 and Parenting Education

                         teacher training. The Bank support the 2012 launch by Directorate of community block grant for Parenting.

                         The cascade training introduced by the program has produced high quality training materials and a pool of National, Provincial and Master Trainers # who then trained all the village
                         teachers. A series of activities have been agreed in 2011 and 2012 to continue the technical/ professional support to teachers including the production of simplified resources for
                         Master Trainers and village teachers, the use of cluster meetings as learning forums and the use of apprenticeships to update teacher skills as well as involving other potential
                         trainers in the district to broaden the district pools of qualified trainers/ resource people.

                         #        Improved Monitoring System
                         Through close collaboration between Directorate#s and Bank team, the monitoring system has improved through a data processing program that allows the generation of a data set
                         on the relative performance of the 50 participating districts. In parallel, an integrated Monitoring system will be piloted in 2 districts to enable the Directorate to map performance of
                         services beyond the 50 participating districts.
