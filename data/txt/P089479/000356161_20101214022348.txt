    This study finds that Indonesia is not living up to its full potential                        In focusing on Indonesia's potential, Table 3 presents
    of preparing students for success and proper adjustment in                                    opportunities for the ECED project as it progresses in
    school and beyond. Of course, Indonesia is not alone--it is                                   implementation. These pre-project findings show that MoNE
    estimated that poverty is suppressing the cognitive potential of                              can strengthen services by focusing on areas of vulnerability,
    around 200 million children throughout the world                                              such as language and cognitive development. It is also notable
    (Grantham-McGregor 2007), but ECED projects like the one                                      that early childhood development services seem to be very
    supported by MoNE have a chance to reverse or mitigate the                                    limited and/or little utilized, so this presents an opportunity for
    effects of such suppression.                                                                  the project to reach thousands of children who haven't been
                                                                                                  exposed before.


       Table 3: ECED Baseline Key Findings and Recommendations

                                 Findings                                                                                  Recommendations

         Chronic nutrition problems need to be addressed if             Project could better coordinate with posyandu by asking posyandu staff to educate teachers and parents at
         children are to flourish                                       centers, and center staff could refer parents to posyandu.

         Children's social and communication skills are strong          Current level of project attention in this area is sufficient.

         Children's language and cognitive vulnerability                Direct resources to books, storytelling and cognitive stimulation at centers, and teaching parents to do this
         presents opportunity for project to better prepare             at home. Consider offering books for home borrowing as part of ECED center, and/or work with
         children for primary school                                    community libraries to promote reading to children and lending books. Consider educating posyandu staff
                                                                        about vulnerability and ways to address it since exposure is near universal at posyandu.

         Parents could be exposed to more ways of stimulating           Project's greatest potential for affecting child development is engaging parents. Support parental
         child development                                              caregiving education to promote attachment and early stimulation by role modeling and engagement in
                                                                        playgroups.

         Nearly all of one-year olds and over half of four-year         Programs can have the greatest impact at younger ages. Significant scope to increase participation,
         olds have never been exposed to an early childhood             especially for younger children (ages 0-3). Add more focused services, linking with posyandu, a model for
         service                                                        early childhood service delivery.
