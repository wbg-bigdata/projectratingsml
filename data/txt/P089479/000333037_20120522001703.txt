3.     Summary of implementation progress.

     a. The Project is rated “Satisfactory? on both Project Development Objectives (PDO) and
        Implementation Progress. Most of the performance indicators have been met, and in some
        instances targets have even been exceeded. Nearly 6,000 target community-managed ECED
        centers have been funded and are operational, providing services to children ages 0-6 years old.
        More than 497,000 children (mostly 3-6 years old) have now enrolled in these services. A
        parenting program will be introduced this year to increase immediate benefits to younger
        children and to prepare those children for later successful participation in ECED centers.
        Another notable progress at the community level is the functioning of a community-based
        monitoring team (TPP) which had been idle in previous years. Their active role in conducting
        annual assessments to ECED centers now strengthens community accountability and
        sustainability.

     b. On the set of indicators that relate to establishing the foundation of a good quality and
        sustainable ECED system at district level, progress has been made in two key areas, namely: (i)
        almost all districts (47 out of 50) have issued regulations supporting an ECED position in the
        district government structure. Most of these districts have included early childhood education
        in their Strategic District Development Plan (RENSTRADA) and allocated a portion of shared
        budget support to the ECED program; and (ii) the establishment of 500 ECED model service
        centers (10 in each district) has become a good practice reference for other kind of services in
        villages on early childhood education. District level support to teachers has been strengthened
        through the establishment of ECED teacher working groups (Gugus PAUD) where teachers
        share and discuss teaching and learning experiences, improving their capacity.

     c. Another project success has been made at the national level through assistance to the
        Government of Indonesia (GOI) in developing a national quality assurance system following
        the issuance of ECED Standards. A draft PAUD minimum service standards (MSS) is being
        finalized at the Ministry of Education and Culture. MSS will be an essential operating tool for
        both service providers and sector agencies to plan and implement high quality PAUD services.
        Other highlights include the ongoing development of comprehensive and coordinated national
        support system for teachers and training providers. This includes strengthening curriculum
        frameworks for Undergraduate and Post Graduate ECED programs, and teacher training and
        course system.

     d. As of March 7, 2012, the cumulative disbursement rate is 71% and 90% for the Grant and
        Credit respectively.

4.     Justification for the proposed reallocation.

     a. Category 1 of the IDA credit is overdrawn, due to a larger number of village teachers trained
        reflecting greater demand. This increase is compensated by a decrease in other categories due
        to under-spending (See Table 1).

     b. The reallocation in the Trust Fund Categories relates to reductions in Regional Management
        Consultants due to procurement delays (now fully resolved) and the need to increase Technical
        Support for Project Management and Monitoring (See Table 2).
