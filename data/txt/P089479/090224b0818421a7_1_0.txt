                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the project is to improve poor children's overall development and readiness for further education, within a sustainable quality ECED
                         system. To achieve this objective, the project will: (i) Increase poor communities' capacity to engage in participatory planning that will result in new or improved ECED
                         services for their children and families (see Component 1); (ii) Prepare the foundation for a sustainable ECED system through budgetary commitments from participating
                         districts, establishment of a national quality assurance and professional development system, and district capacity building (see Component 2); (iii) Ensure continuous
                         improvement of service delivery and system building throughestablishing effective project management, and monitoring and evaluation (see Component 3).

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The achievement of Key Performance Indicators has been substantial.
                         - As the ECED Project nears completion, most of the indicators that relate to increasing provision of services in poor communities through a participatory planning process have been
                         fully met or exceeded. Enrollment in the 5,990 project supported centres has reached 537,000, mostly children ages 3-6.

                         - On the set of indicators that relate to establishing the foundation of a sustainable ECED system, progress has been made in two key areas: 70% of districts have issued regulations
                         supporting an ECED position in the district government (project target is 80%), and the targeted number of Master Trainers trained has been fully met. Almost all of them were
                         involved in conducting local training for teachers and an increasing number (47%) of these trainers conduct monitoring visits to provide technical support to teachers.
                         On the set of indicators that relate to the project monitoring system, the number of communities submitting reports to districts has now increased to 93%, because of the introduction
                         of a new reporting format. More on the expansion and piloting of the project's M&E system for non-project-supported ECED services is discussed in a later section of this report. By
                         being more transparent and accountable both to districts and communities, these ECED services are expected to attract more support to sustain their operations after the project
                         ends.

                         Key progress and challenges by project component
                         Component 1
                         - By 2012, the community block grants that support the establishment of 5,990 village ECD services had been fully disbursed. The remaining block grants to be disbursed are the
                         District Matching Grants to support the establishment of district resource centres. As the project-supported block grants are phasing out, the government has started disbursing
                         various block grants in selected project areas, funded by a government matching budget (counterpart fund).

                         To address the challenge of sustaining service operations beyond the project, several strategies are being devised, including linking up to operational block grant (BoP) by central
                         and local government, linking up with Village Fund as well as linking up with private sectors (through Corporate Social Responsibility schemes)

                         - Quality of services. The project monitoring system rates the quality of services using a composite measure consisting of 6 components: Institutional variables (kelembagaan),
                         Planning and administration (rencana kerja dan administrasi), Health and nutrition (kesehatan dan gizi), Learning activities (pembelajaran), Community participation (partisipasi
                         masyarakat), and Program sustainability (keberlanjutan program PAUD). Data from the 3rd monitoring cycle ( May 2011) rate the services, on average, in the “C? performance
                         category, with the learning activity component being the lowest-rated component. In the 4th monitoring cycle (November 2011-February 2012), the average rating improved to B. The
                         scores on the learning process increased, reflecting apparent improvement in the learning activities. Explanations for this shift in performance are being reviewed. Cycle 5 is
                         underway.

                         - Holistic Integrated ECD service. Following the issuance of the government's guidelines for Holistic Integrated ECD services, greater coordination between services is being
                         encouraged in the project- supported centers. As of June, 20% of the total 6000 ECED centers (some 1200 centers) have been attempting to provide holistic ECED services to some
                         extent, linking with Posyandu/Pos PAUD and PKK and parenting classes.

                         - Collaboration with PNPM Generasi. A pilot is being implemented in 2 districts. As of October, indicators of access to ECD service for ages 0-3 and 4-6 have been introduced; the
                         monitoring system has been adjusted to reflect these indicators; training materials for facilitators have been developed; and community mapping has been redone to capture 0-6

                         participation in ECED services as baseline data and as a basis for communities’ proposing ECD-related activities. Evaluation of the pilot is scheduled in December 2012.

                         Component 2
                         - Minimum Service Standards for ECED services are being developed. Drafts have been submitted to the Ministry of Home Affairs for review. The following targets were proposed to
                         be achieved by districts in 2019: availability of minimum 1 ECD service in every village, with trained teachers in half of these services.

                         - An improved ECED monitoring system, based on models from the ECED project, is being piloted for broader use by the Government. The pilot also produced two key documents: i)
                         a Manual for Supervisors (Penilik), covering general information on Monitoring and Evaluation, as well as relevant information on ECD; and ii) a technical guideline (Juknis) for
                         Monitoring and Evaluation for use at the national/ province/ district levels. These materials will be published and used nation-wide.

                         Although the regular monitoring system shows some general improvement in the quality of services, there is a significant challenge concerning the quality of the support system for
                         teachers. In part, the challenges arise from the transfer of the teacher training mandate from the Directorate of ECED (current implementing unit) to the Directorate of Teacher

                         Component 3
                         Impact Evaluation

                         The impact evaluation design involved following two cohort s of children – aged 1 and 4 years old when first assessed in 2009. The design allows us to compare children in villages
                         with the project to children in villages without the project. A summary of the results of the evaluation which uses assessments on the same children in 2010 (when the cohorts are 2
                         and 5 years old respectively) is summarized below:
                         1.        For the one-year old cohort, we find few statistically significant differences between children in project villages and children in non-project villages. While children's outcomes
                         improve as they get older (see the indicators summarized in this ISR) there are few differences that are attributable to the project. This is understandable since the project largely
                         provided playgroups that cater to children that are older than one or two years old.
                         2.        For the four-year old cohort, we find statistically significant and practically important differences between children living in project villages and children living in non-project
                         villages on some developmental domains. These differences are more pronounced for:
                         a.        Children from poorer households
                         b.        Children who had never been to ECED services before the project
                         c.        Children whose parents have below-average parenting practices.

                         For the remaining life of project life, focus will be given on strengthening Component 2: which is building foundation for a sustainable ECED system through budgetary commitments
                         from participating districts, establishment of a national quality assurance and professional development system, and district capacity building.
