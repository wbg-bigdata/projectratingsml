                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Emergency Recovery Project in the amount of $70 million was approved in September 2010 to support the government in addressing the economic and social impact of the crisis
                         that hit the Kyrgyz Republic in April and June 2010. The project has two components (financed equally at $35 million) with the objectives of (a) to strengthen the Government's
                         financial resilience to meet the priority needs of its emergency recovery program and (b) to restore reliability and security of energy services - electricity and heating -- especially in
                         Osh and Jalalabad where energy infrastructure was damaged and to provide adequate heating to population during the winter.

                         Under Component 1, $28million was used as retroactive payment towards gas purchases from Uzbekistan to ensure availability of supplies for winter heating and to free up budget

                         resources for the government to finance high priority expenditures. This money was disbursed soon after the start of the project, in early October 2010.

                         Implementation of the remaining parts of the project were delayed due to several factors including limited capacity in the government, especially for procurement, bidding processes
                         that had to be repeated to ensure adherence to Bank procurement guidelines, and unforeseen delays in delivery of goods on part of the suppliers.

                         A sub-component of Component 1 financed textbooks, furniture, and computer for schools. The procurement process for four contracts (two on printing books, one on procurement of
                         furniture, and one on procurement of computers) was launched during 2011 and all four contracts were signed by March 2012 and successfully completed by end of 2012. Schools
                         furniture was delivered in May 2012 and the delivery of computer equipment to the south of the country and of books was completed later in 2012. The PIU received a request by the
                         Ministry of Education to support the publication of new books; however, given the time required for the procurement process and printing it was concluded that the activities could not
                         be completed by the revised closing date of December 31, 2013.

                         The implementation of Component 2 on “Rehabilitation and Repair of Energy Infrastructure and Networks? was initially delayed due to the delayed conclusion of the Subsidiary Credit
                         Agreements between the Ministry of Finance and the energy companies who are the final recipients of the project funds. To a lesser extent, there were also procurement delays. With
                         the signing of the Subsidiary Agreements in March 2011, extensive implementation support by the Bank and strengthened capacity of the PIU, procurement significantly accelerated.
                         However, the progress achieved was not sufficient to make up for the initial delays, which made it impossible to fully implement Component 2 by the original project closing date of
                         December 31, 2012. Furthermore, cost savings thanks to competitive procurement processes under Component 1 and Component 2 created opportunities for supporting additional
                         critical investments in the energy sector. In view of the above and in response to Government request, the project was extended through December 31, 2013. As of mid-October
                         2013, 148 contracts have been signed in the total amount of $30.9 million, out of which some $29.9 million have been disbursed while the balance of around $1 million will be
                         disbursed by the end of December. Few additional contracts of about $2.2 million are expected to be signed in early November and implemented through the end of December. The
                         outcome and results indicators for Component 2 have been met.

                         In response to a Government request, the project was restructured in July 2013 to accommodate additional technical assistance, including in support of the CASA-1000 project that
                         will enhance the security of power supply in the country and help mitigate winter power emergency situations.
