                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Emergency Recovery Project in the amount of $70 million was approved in September 2010 to support the government in addressing the economic and social impact of the crisis
                         that hit the Kyrgyz Republic in April and June 2010. The project has two components (financed equally at $35 million) with the objectives of (a) to strengthen the Government's
                         financial resilience to meet the priority needs of its emergency recovery program and (b) to restore reliability and security of energy services - electricity and heating -- especially in
                         Osh and Jalalabad where energy infrastructure was damaged and provide adequate heating to population during the winter.

                         Under Component 1, $28million was used as retroactive payment towards gas purchases from Uzbekistan to ensure availability of supplies for winter heating and to free up budget

                         resources for the government to finance high priority expenditures. This money was disbursed soon after the start of the project, in early October 2010.

                         Implementation of the remaining parts of the project were delayed due to several factors including limited capacity in the government, especially for procurement, bidding processes
                         that had to be repeated to ensure adherence to Bank procurement guidelines, and unforeseen delays in delivery of goods on part of the suppliers.

                         A sub-component of Component 1 financed textbooks, furniture, and computer for schools. The procurement process for four contracts (two on printing books, one on procurement of
                         furniture, and one on procurement of computers) was launched during 2011 and all four contracts were signed between November 2011 and March 2012. All contracts were
                         successfully completed by end of 2012. Schools furniture was delivered in May 2012 and the delivery of computer equipment to the south of the country and of books was completed
                         later in 2012. The PIU received a request by the Ministry of Education to support the publication of new books; however, given the time required for the procurement process and
                         printing it was concluded that the activities could not be completed by the revised closing date of December 31, 2013.

                         The implementation of Component 2 on “Rehabilitation and Repair of Energy Infrastructure and Networks? was initially delayed due to the delayed conclusion of the Subsidiary Credit
                         Agreements between the Ministry of Finance and the energy companies who are the final recipients of the project funds. To a lesser extent, there were also procurement delays. With
                         the signing of the Subsidiary Agreements in March 2011, extensive implementation support by the Bank and strengthened capacity of the PIU, procurement has significantly
                         accelerated since July 2011. However, the progress achieved since that time has not made for the initial delays, which made it impossible to fully implement Component 2 by the
                         original project date of December 31, 2012. Furthermore, cost savings thanks to competitive procurement processes under Component 1 and Component 2 created opportunities for
                         supporting additional critical investments in the energy sector. In view of the above and in response to Government request, the project was extended through December 31, 2013.
                         As of end of March 2013, 119 contracts have been signed to the amount of about $26.8 million, out of which some $20.7 million have been disbursed. The total amount of packages
                         that are at an advanced stage of procurement is around $5.5 million. The outcome and results indicators for Component 2 are either met, or will be fully met once the remaining funds
                         are utilized. In order to avoid the need for further extension, no new goods or works procurements will be launched during the remainder of 2013.

                         In response to a Government request, the project is being restructured to accommodate additional technical assistance, including in support of the CASA-1000 project that will
                         enhance the security of power supply in the country and help mitigate winter power emergency situations. The restructuring is supposed to be completed by the end of May 2013.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Due to significant increase in number of signed contracts under the second component, the Bank has agreed to the use of the maximum balance of the government's project account

                         to accelerate disbursement.

                         The project’s closing date was recently extended by twelve months to December 31, 2013. The extension of the project will allow completion of the procurement of more complex
                         equipment to improve the reliability of power supply and increase its resilience.

                         The ERP is currently being restructured to allow for the provision of limited technical assistance to support the implementation of the energy sector reform plan and the Central Asia-
                         South Asia electricity transmission project (CASA-1000). Both activities fall under the development objective of the Emergency Recovery Project.
