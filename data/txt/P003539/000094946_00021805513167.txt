ENVIRONMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT
ON THE PROJECT OF SUSTAINABLE
DEVELOPMENT OF CHINESE
COASTAL RESOURCE
Introduction
Since the reformation and open door policy were carried into effect, Chinese fishery has
been rapidly developed.  The rise ratio of aquatic-production is 13.6% annually, which
is much higher than the world average level of 1.5%.  The total yield in 1995 reached
28000 metric ton which accounted for 25% of the total yield of the world and ranked
first in the world.
Chinese fisheries is taking a fishery developing road with Chinese characteristics. In the
procession of fishery development in China, some new problems emerged, among which
diseases of culturaled species (for example, prawn disease)occurred serious in recent
years, natural resources of marine fishery seriously declined, water quality of coastal
areas nearby big cities and industrial zones became polluted, and over-exploiting of
fisheries in some areas have exceeded their bearing capacity.
The problems mentioned above directly influence whether the Chinese fishery can be
sustainable development.  The Chinese relevant authorities have recognized this
serious problem and made their best endeavours to solve it. However, the  fishery is
a trade with high investment and high benefit. The funds for developing fishery must
be raised through various channels.  One of the channels is to introduce foreign funds
for expediting the development of Chinese fishery. For this reason, the Ministry of
Agriculture in China has applied for a World Bank loan for  the project of
comprehensive development of fisheries in the southeast coastal area of China in 1995.
The State Planning Committee in China has arranged the project for the three years'
rolling plan of World Bank loan. The project group of World Bank visited China and
investigated the project in May of 1996. After consulting with the State Planning
Committee, the Ministry of Finance , the Ministry of Agriculture and the relevant
departments of the project areas, the project was finalized and named as "the project of
sustainable development of chinese coastal resources    The total amount of the loan is
100 millions $US.



Because the project of sustainable development of Chinese coastal resources is a
constructing project of ecological agriculture , the object of construction is to ensure
marine ecological balance and reaches sustainable and good e'cological circulation of
fisheries. Therefore, the scope and degree of disadvantageous impact caused by
environment will be limited and some disadvantageous impacts in the process of
construction and production may be reduced to an acceptable degree by adopting
advanced technology and proper measures of prevention and control.
Brief Description of the Project
Fujiang, Jiangsu (Nantong city), Shangdong and Liaoning provinces are designated as

1.2    Analysis of Mariculture Production
1.2.1  Fry and larva species, quantity and source
The fries for mariculture of net cages are fish fries of Paralichthys
olivaceus,Pseudosciaena crocea, Pagerosomus major, lateolabra japonicus
and Zonichthys nigrofasciatus.
The net cages mariculture of this project will need 3,780,000 fries for
Paralichthys olivaceus, 1,488,0000 fries with 3 cm long for Pseudosciaena
crocea, 1,000,0000 fries with 3 cm long for Pagrosomus major, 4,000,000 fries

Fig. 1.2-1 Engineering procedure of net cage mariculture
The net cages are closed nylon ones covered with anti-adhesion paint outside,
and the paint used is proved no harmful and poisonous to the cultured
organisms.  According to the living habits of maricultured species, the net
cages are reformed and fitted with iron frame at the bottom in order to make
cage bottom plain and let the water flow freely through the cage.  The net
cages will be put in shallow water areas at 5-10 m depth, with a distance
between cages no less than 2 m and between lines is no less than 10 m. The
cages should be arranged along the vertical direction with the current.
1.2.3   Diet, feeding manner, quantity, remanent diet and feces
There are two types of diets for net cage mariculture.
I. Fresh or frozen little fishes
II. Soft particulate mixture diet made of fish meal and some kinds of vitamins.
The diet is fed manually.  The quantity of diet fed, remanent  diet and feces
are dependent on the mariculture species.   The feeding  amount for
Paralichthys olivaceus is usually determined by water temperature, water
quality and feeding condition. The daily feeding amount is controlled at 5-6%
of fish's weight at the mature fish stage, feeding 3 times per day when the fish is
15-20 cm lenth and 2 times per day (once in morning and once in evening ) when
fish is over 20 cm long.  For one cage, about 20 kg diet are fed per day and
3



about I kg residual feed and 11.4-15.2 kg feces are left over.
The flounders can be harvested and sold when their individual weight is over
0.75 kg, and the yield per cage will reach 400 kg or 16 kg/m2, 1,512 metric
ton living fish will be harvested annually.
The feeding amount for yellow large croaker, genuine porgy, japanese seabass
and blackhanded amberjack in mariculture of net cages in Fujian province is
73,690 metric ton of frozen little fish and 4,106 metric ton of fish meal.

The amount of remanent diet and feces can be calculated based on the following
formula, if the efficient of conversion of energy is 90%.
Amount of remanent feeds and feces = feeding amount - yield
90%
Table 1.2-2 lists the estimating amount of remanent feeds and feces in net
cage mariculture in Fujian province based on the above formula.

1.2.4   Analysis and assessment of sewage discharge quantity in relation
to water quality and red tide organisms
Net cage mariculture is usually chosen in the area where is an open and wide sea
4



area with higher velocity of ocean current and good water exchange.
The discharge quantity of pollutants produced by mariculture usually shows by
loads of N and P.  The calculating formula is as follow~s:
TN = (CxNp-Nb)X 10

The results of investigation at present show that the water quality in Funing Bay,
Sandu Bay, Pingtan sea water, Xinghua Bay, Dagang Bay and Dongshang Bay
of Fujiang province are good. The contents of N and P are less than the
standards of first category sea water (N=0.2 mg/L, P=0.3 mg/L). Thus, a
small amount of N and P discharge in net cage mariculture does not affect the
water quality of these bays.
But the water quality of Shacheng Bay and Quanzhou Bay in Fujiang province
belongs to the standards of third category sea water (N=0.3 mg/L, P=0.045
mg/L).  The N  and P discharge in net cage mariculture may cause local
S



eutrophication in these two bays and result in occurrence of red tide. Therefore
it is suggested that the quantity of net cage mariculture must be limited.
The water quality of the west waters of Xiamen bay has been eutrophication,
where the water exchange is bad.  If the net cages of mariculture are set in this
area, it will make water.quality further worse.  It may result in breaking out of
red tide and disease of mariculture organisms in this area.
The present contents of N and P are 0.01555 mg/L and 0.00256 mg/L,
respectively in the area of net cage mariculture of Rongcheng Bay, Shangdong
province, which are much lower than the threshold value of eutrophication
( N=0.2-0.3 mg/L, P=0.045 mg/L). The organic pollution caused by net cage
mariculture is limited and the water exchange is better in this area, so the N and
P contents will not be raised remarkably.  In normal circumstances, there is
less possibility of red tide resulted from net cage mariculture in this area.

1.3    Environmental Status in Surrounding Area of Net Cage Mariculture
1.3.1   Meteorology dynamic
* Rongcheng Bay of Shangdong province
The climate of Rongcheng bay is temperature zone and monsoon style with
distinct seasonal change.  In winter , controlled by Mongolia-Siberia high
6



pressure, the cold air frequently invades, northwest monsoon prevails, cold
and arid, but influenced by the ocean, there is no severe cold but more
windy weather.  In summer, controlled by Asia co'ntinental low pressure
and subtropical high pressure, southeast monsoon prevails, there is no high
temperature and the weather is warm and wet due to the influence of ocean.
The climate characters around one year are moderate rainfall, humid air and
warm weather.
The mean annual temperature is 11.8 C . The lowest monthly average to
temperature is -1.6 C and appears in January with extreme value of -9.9
'C . The highest one is 24.8 C in August with extreme value of 33.1 C.
The monthly-mean temperature is listed in table 1.3-1.

The mean annual precipitation is 742 mm, rainfall is concentrated from June
to September, with total mean precipitation of 521 mm, covered 70% of the
annual rainfall. There are 95 days with average rainfall (o. 1 mm/d), and
the mean annual evaporate amount is 1536 mm. Table 1.3-2 gives the
monthly-mean precipitation.

The mean annual wind speed is 5.6 m/s, northwest and north wind are the
main wind directions around one year, whose appearing frequencies are
23% and 17%, respectively. The maximum wind speed was 40 m/s in the
cape of Chengshan.  The mean annual wind days are 88 with over force 6
wind.  This area can be influenced by typhoon in summer.  According to
the statistical data of the year 1949-1982, there are average 2.1 times of
typhoon annually, but the typhoon center seldomly lands in this area.
*  Net cage mariculture in the bay of Fujian province
The scope of mean annual temperature in the ten bays of Fujian province is
from 18.5 C to 20.8 'C, and the highest mean annual temperature appears
in the Dongshan Bay and the lowest in Shacheng Bay. The highest monthly
average temperature appears in July or August in the ten bays, and the
distribution scope is between 27.3-28.7 C.  The lowest monthly average
temperature appears in January or February, and the distribution scope is
between 8.5-12.9 'C.

The mean annual precipitation in the ten bays are between 977.5-1656.4
mm and the highest mean annual precipitation appears in Shacheng Bay and
the lowest in Dagang Bay.  Rainfalls in the ten bays are concentrated in
spring and summer.
The mean annual wind speeds in the ten bays are between 1.4-7.1 m/s and
the maximum mean annual wind speed appears in Dongshan Bay , and the
minimum in Sandu Bay. The north and northeast winds are the main wind
direction of the ten bays in autumn, winter and spring, and the southern wind
is the main wind direction in summer. These bays could be influenced by
the disaster weathers of tropical storm, cold wave, frost , hail, rainstorm,
gale and drought.  They are frequently influenced by tropical storm from
July to September.  According to statistics, these bays are averagely
influenced by 5-6 tropical storms each year.  Table 1.3-3 gives some
statistical values of meteorological parameters in the ten bays of Fujian
province.

1.3.2   Hydrographic dynamic
*  Rongcheng Bay of Shangdong province
This area is close to the noon-tide compartment of M2 branch of the Yellow
Sea, tide is the main hydrodynamic factor which may influence marine
environment, the style of tide is irregular half-day tide, the phenomenon of
daily non-equivalent is obvious,and tide range is relatively small.  The
mean tide range is 0.75 m in the cape of Chengshan and gets more and more
southwards, and it reaches 1.0 m in the mariculture area.  The style of tidal
current is regular half-day tide, which is different from tide, the directioh of
flood tide current is southward, and the ebb tide current is northward.
8



Although it is an open area, the tide current velocity is not quick in
mariculture area, and the maximum velocity is no more than 0.60 cm/s.
The velocity is getting quick beyond 10 m isobath, and the maximum can
reach 0.8-0.9 cm/s.
This sea area is also influenced by the coastal current from Bohai sea, which
goes from north to south along 20 m isobath and is stronger in winter, very
weak in summer, it is very favorable to the mariculture environment here.
In addition, there is a strong tide mixed up-welling.  In summer, the
bottom cold water of the yellow sea upwells to surface layer in coastal area
as a result of strong tidal mixture, the water with low temperature and high
nutrition can be formed and make the water temperature lower about 2 'C
than other areas.
The mean annual water temperature is 11.6 C . The annual change range is
relatively smaller because of above reasons, the lowest water temperature
appears in January with monthly mean of 1.71 *C, and the highest appears in
September with monthly mean of 22.47 C. The temperature rises more
quickly from April to May , and falls more quickly from October to
November. Table 1.3-4 gives the mean monthly water temperature of
Rongcheng Bay.

temperature
The salinity is at the range of 30.8-32.1 %o, and annual mean temperature is
31.6 'C . There is no big river runoff so that the seasonal change of salinity
is not great.  The salinity is relatively high in spring and autumn, lower in
winter due to the influence of coastal current from Bohai Sea in winter.
* Ten bays of Fujian province
The styles of tide of nine bays of Fujian province are regular half-day tide
except Dongshan Bay which is irregular half-day tide with 6.63 hours of
mean high tide period and 5.75 hours of mean low tide period. The mean
tide ranges of the ten bays are from 2.30 to 5.31 m, and the largest tide is in
Sandu Bay and the smallest mean tide ranges in Dongshan Bay.  The
maximum tide ranges of the ten bays are from 4.14 m to 8.38 m and the
largest and smallest one are still in Sandu Bay and Dongshan Bay
respectively.  The directions and velocities of tidal current in the ten bays
are influenced by the topography of bays, and there exist bigger differences
among them.
The mean wave height in the ten bays are between 0.1-1.5 m and the
9



maximum mean wave height appears in Pingtan sea waters and the minimum
in Sandu Bay.  Table 1.3-5 gives the statistical values of some tidal and

1.3.5 Biological dynamic
The N and P contents are higher in the pollutants discharged by the net cage
mariculture. It often results in flourishing of phytoplankton in the surrounding
area of net cage mariculture and sometimes brings out red tide. It is important to
know the quantity, distribution and dominant species of phytoplankton in the
mariculture area.
2



A great quantity of zooplankton reproduced may control the fast increasing of
phytoplankton and eliminate red tide. However, zooplankton is more sensitive to
environmental change, so the pollutants such as H2S NH4, etc. produced by net
cage mariculture may often limit its growth.
Net cage mariculture may largerly influence on the sedimentary environment.
The deposit of remanent feed and feces may cause the increase of sulphide and
decrease of Oxygen in the sediments. It will influence the growth of benthos.
The number of bacteria and colon bacillus is usually higher in the area seriously
influenced by discharge of domestic sewage and mariculture waste water. It can
make the mariculture organisms easily infected with various diseases.
'The distribution of fish egg and larva number is related to water quality. If the net
cage mariculture influences on water quality,it will also influence on fish egg and
larva number in the mariculture area.
0   Rongcheng Bay of Shandong province
The mean total cell number of phytoplankton is 57.74 x 14 ind./m3 in
spring ,  in which the dominant species are Ditylum  brightwellii
Melosira sp. ,  Asterionella japonica  ,  Chaetoceros affinis
Skeletonema costatum, and Biddulphia sinnensis . The mean total cell
number is 35.2 x    mind/m3 in autumn, in which the dominant species
are Asterionellajaponica, Chaetoceros affinis, Nitzschia paradoxa,
coscinodicscus graniii    leptocylindrus danicus etc. The primary
productivity is 6.25 g/m2.
Copepods are the dominant species of zooplankton, covering about 50%
of total species of zooplankton,  in which Calanus sinicus is the main
species. There also exist sagitta crassa and the larva of other organisms.
There are 250 species of organisms in the inter-tidal zone and the main
economic species are Tegillarca granosa, Ruditapes philippinnarum
Mactra chinensis, Solen sp., Ostrea sp., Sargassum fusiforme and
sargassum thunbergii etc.

1.3.6  Potential pollution sources and pollutants
*  Rongcheng Bays of Shandong province
There are 21 villages in the coastal area along the mariculture sea area with
a total population of 20,000 people in which 12,000 people are engaged
in fishery production.
There are 35 factories of villages and towns including small-size aquatic
product processing factories, hatchery farms and net factories in the coastal
area.  The main pollution sources are domestic sewage discharged from
the coastal residential area and the industrial waste water discharged by the
above-motioned factors and the main pollutants are organic pollutants.
All of the coastal rivers are short and small seasonal rivers, their lengths
generally only 3-6km.  Small-scale reservoirs are built at the upper of the
rivers .The run-off of these rivers only appear in summer with lower flow
and carry some pollutants into the bay in rainy season, but the influenced
range is smaller and can not threaten the mariculture area.
*  Ten Bays of Fujian province
The potential pollution sources in Funing, Pingtan and Dagang Bays mainly
are the domestic sewage and mariculture waste water discharged by
surrounding villages and towns. The pollutants mainly are organics.
Because the mouths of these bays are wide and water-change are strong,
the pollutants discharged will not influence on net cage mariculture.
The potential pollution sources in Shacheng, Dongshan, Quanzhou and
Xinghua Bays mainly are industrial waste discharged by some villages,
factories and joint-venture factories such as dyeing house, sugar plant
chemical factory. The main pollutants are COD, phenol and heavy metals,
etc. In addition ,the waste water of mariculture and domistic sewage are
also important sources of pollution which may certainly influence on these
bays. The area of net cage mariculture in Meizhou bay is located nearby the
releasing point of waste water and oil wharf of Fujian oil refinery. The oil
content in the surrounding waters is often over the standard of fisherywater
quality.  A few accidents of oil spilling have occurred in this bay.  The
expansion project of Fujian oil refinery is just under planning and the
discharge quantity of pollutants is expected to increase largely.  Thus ,the
development of net cage mariculture in this bay should be carefully
considered. The net cages had better be set in the waters east of Huiyu
where is far from the releasing point of waste water of Fujian oil refinery.
A few rivers flow into Sandu Bay with various pollutants.  A large
quantity of untreated waste water discharged from villages and factories are
directly released   into  Sandu Bay, which has been impairing the
environmental quality of the Bay .At present the oil content has exceeded
the standard of fishery water quality.  The water quality in.Sandu Bay will
become worse with the increase of pollutants year by year.
16



The west sea area of Xiamen is main area into where the industrial waste
water and domestic sewage of Xiamen city and Xinling industrial region are
released. The water quality has been much bad now and it will be becoming
worse and worse with the continuous increase of population and factories.
1.4    Assessment of Environmental imnpact on surrounding environment of net cage
mariculture
1.4.1   Change of water quality
*  Rongcheng Bay of Shandong province
The present water quality of mariculture area is good and belongs to the
first category of sea water quality standard .Net cage mariculture will have
some impacts on the surrounding waters to a certain extent.
The main factors of impacts on water quality caused by net cage
mariculture are remanent diet and fish excrements.
Frozen block diet is intended to use for feeding Palichthys olivaceus, which
can float on the sea surface for a certain time waiting for the fish to catch,
so the remanent diet is very little, generally about 5%. The daily feeding
amount is 20kg per net cage ,so about lkg of remanent diet, will sink to the
sea bottom of mariculture area each net cage perday.The diet efficiency of
fish is about 20-40%, so that the total fish excretion of one net cage will be
about 11.4-15.2kg. Thus, about 4.8-6.1kg organics will sink to the sea
bottom from one net cage and the amount of organics sedimented will be
about 46-58g/m2 per day.
The sedimentary organics will be decomposed gradually and it will result in
the increase of nutrition, consumption of DO, algae proliferation and even
eutrophication of water body in serious circumstances.
The planned mariculture area is located in an open bay with relatively high
velocity of oceanic and tidal current and good water change .There are over
4400 ha. of sea area which can be developed and utilized.  At present, only
the mariculture of 3,780 net cages is planned, which occupies 397 ha. of sea
area covering only 9% of sea area utilized.
According to the tidal current character of this area, if marine mixed
diffusion is not considered, the remanent diet and excretions will make the
increase of organic content about lmg/L except the sedimentaries.  It will
not result in water quality exceeding the first category of marine water
quality together with the background concentration. When considering
daily transporation distance of 2.6-4.3km produced by the residual current
(generaly 0.3-0.5 cm/s)and strong tidal mixture, the water with high
organic concentration can be moved out the mariculture area .Therefore,
the planned mariculture scale will affect the water environment lightly and
will not lead to the water quality exceeding the first standard.
17



* Ten Bays of Fujian province
In the process of net cage mariculture ,remanent diet and fish excrements
are discharged into the surrounding sea area .Among them, the soluble part
is directly into the sea water, while the insolubles, some organisms, sink to
the sea bottom. The main items influenced on water quality in net cage
mariculture are S$, BOD, COD, DO, N, P. pH, H2S, NH4 etc. It is
estimated that 8.34 tons of remanent diet and fish excrements will be.
discharged into the sea area per ton of fish maricultured . It will make the
sea area to increase 251.4kg N and 33.7kg P. According to the project of
net cage mariculture in Fujian ,the mariculture may produce 9,965 metric
ton of fish and 83,148 metric ton of remanent diet and fish excrements
(calculating on wet weight)which may produce 2,505.21 metric ton N and
335.84 metric ton P . When these pollutants are discharged into the
mariculture areas, it will certainly cause pollution of the bays but not in
serious condition, because the original water quality is good and tidal
current is strong with bigger water depth. But in some bays where the
original water quality has been worse and tidal current is weak with
shallower water depth it may cause serious influence on these bays such as
Xiamen Bay.
1.4.2   Change of hydrodynamic (water current and tidal action)
The sizes of the proposed net cage are 5m x 5m x 5m and 2m x 2m x 2m,
which may have a resistance to sea water flow and reduce the current velocity in
net cage area.  Based on calculation by half -experienced formula and the size
of net mesh and twine, the current velocity will reduce 40-50% in mariculture
area, but the current velocity in the bilateral and at the bottom area will
increase .The mariculture areas usually only cover no more than 5% of total
area of a bay, so that the tidal current field and tidal process will not be changed
by net cage mariculture.
1.4.3  Change of sediment dynamic
The insolubles in remanent diet and fish excrements sink to the sea bottom in
the process of net cage mariculture, which may influence on the sedimentary
environment quality ,usually 80% of remanent diet and fish excrements enter
the sea water and 20% of them sink to the bottom.
The decomposing velocity of pollutants sunk to the bottom is very slow, so they
are accumulated unceasingly, and result in the change of sedimentary
environment .The decomposition of sedimentary organics may consume a great
deal of DO and result in the reduction of DO in the bottom mud and the increase
of sulphide which may directly threaten the survival of benthos and cause the
change of benthic population Lack of 02 and the increase of sulphide may
imperil fishes and shellfishes living at the sea bottom.

The accumulation degree of remanent diet and fish excrements on the sea
bottom under the net cage is related to following factors i.e., total content of
pollutants, the characteristic at surface of sea bottom: water depth and tidal
current velocity. The diffusion distance of remanent diet and fish excrements
can be calculated based on the following formula:
d=DxG/V
where
d - diffusion distance
D  - water depth
V  -  sinking velocity of particulates
C, -  current velocity
Usually, the sinking matters produced by net cage mariculture are distributed in
ellipse along the tidal current direction at the center of net cage. 40-70% of
total sinking matters are just under the net cage. The sinking pollutants in the
scope of 25m radius at the center of net cage make up 90% of the total sink in
pollutants . Almost all sinking pollutants are distributed in the scope of 50m
radius. Of course, the distribution scope of sinking pollutants is positive
relationship with current velocity and water depth.
The deeper the water depth at the position of net cage is, the larger and the
distributional scope and the smaller the sink in thickness will be.
When tidal current velocity is larger, the distribution scope becomes wider. The
positions of net cage in this project are chosen in the area where the water depth
is more than 8m and the maximum tidal current velocity is about 30cm/s. It may
increase the distribution scope of sinking pollutants and decrease the sinking
thickness. Thus, it may improve the self-purification capacity and lighten the
pollution of net cage mariculture on sedimentary environment .
1.4.4  Others
The organic pollutants caused by net cage mariculture may also influence on the
biological community, especially the benthic animal community. The biological
monitoring on organic pollution has shown that the pollution at 0 m aparting
from net cage is seious, the medium pollution at lOm aparting from net cage,
transitional zone at 30m, the light pollution at 60m and normal zone beyond
60m. Therefore, the impact of net cage mariculture on benthic biological
community is restricted in the area under the net cage and adjacent area ,which
is a very small area comparing with the whole bay.
Net cage mariculture will not bring negative impact on benthic eco-system in
the most-bays.
19



1.5   Impact of environmental conditions oni net cage mariculture
1.5.1  Impact of surrounding water environment on net cage mariculture
There is no other aquatic culture in Rongcheng Bay of Shandong Province at
present and it is mainly a natural sea area, so the surrounding water
environment has no any negative impact on mariculture.
In the bays of Fujian,except the west sea area of Xiamen and Quanzhou Bay,
where the water quality has.become bad. If the amount and location of net
cage mariculture are considered impraperly, they may produce inadvantageous
impacts on the net cage mariculture. The water environmental qualities in other
bays are basically good and they will not produce negative influence on net cage
mariculture.
1.5.2  Impact of urban sewage discharge on net cage mariculture
*  Rongcheng Bay of Shangdong Province
There are only 20,000 people living in the coastal zone of this area ,so the
amount of domestic sewage discharge is very small. The organic waste
water discharged by 35 small-size enterprises of coastal town and village
which are widely spreaded is also very small. Moreover, it is not directly
discharged into the net cage mariculture area, so it does not produce
obvious impact on the net cage mariculture.
3  Ten Bays of Fujian Province
The contents of BOD, COD, heavy metals and oils in urban sewage are
higher. The mariculture area of net cage must be far from discharging points
of industrial waste water and domestic sewage in order to avoid suffering
influence. According to the planning of net cage mariculture in Fujian, most
of mariculture areas are in compliance with the requirements of mariculture,
but there are three mariculture areas where exist some problems.
I. The west sea area of Xiamen admits about 85% of industrial waste
water and domestic sewage of Xiamen city and Xingling industrial zone.
Thus, it is considered that this area should not continue developing net
cage mariculture.
II. The mariculture area of Meizhou Bay locates nearby the discharging
point of Fujian oil refinery. Based on the recent investigating results,
the oil content in this area has exceeded the first category standard of
sea water quality. Oil spilling accidents possibily occur, and the
mariculture.fish will suffer from death by oil pollution. Thus, it is
considered that the area where it is close to the oil wharf and
discharging point of oil refinery is not proper to develop the net cage
mariculture.
III. Shacheng Bay is long and narrow. The pollutants discharged by Fuding
county and neighbouring county are driven slowly to the outside of bay.
Thus, it is considered that the area nearby the end of bay is not suitable
to develop the net cage mariculture.
20



1.5.3  Impact of runoff on net cage mariculture
The species of net cage mariculture in the project are oceanic fish except
Japanese seabass. If salinity is too low , the growth of fish will be retarded.
Thus, the position of net cage should be far from the mouth of rivers.
The rivers flowing into the mariculture area of Rongcheng Bay of Shandong
Province are of short-range ones with 3-6km long. Small runoff only appears in
rainy season in summer: Although there is no investigating data ,it is certain that
the runoff will not affect the mariculture because the salinity of coastal sea
water is higher and the yearly salinity change is very low (only 0.5 %o)
However, in Fujian there are two mariculture areas which are close to the mouth
of river; one is the mariculture area of Sandu Bay and the other the mariculture
area of Xinghua Bay. These two locations should be adjusted otherwise only
eurysalinity fish of Japanese seabass can be cultured .
1.6    Suggestions and counter-measures
1.6.1  Selection and establishment of different ecological mariculture models.
The ecosystem of shallow water area has stereo-spatial character and food
relationship between organisms at different layers. If different cultural methods
are adopted (for example space mariculture with multi-species and multi-
layers) , it may not only fully utilize the ecological environment and cultural
facilities, but also create good life habitat for organisms and give full play to
productive potentiality of shallow water area.
Rongcheng Bay has favorable environmental conditions ,such as wide of open
mouth, good water exchange, high and stable salinity, fewer runoff, etc.
Therefore, the best cultural model in this area is the space cultivation of
Paralichthys olivaceus,Holothuria sp. and Laminaria  japonica.   The
concrete measures may be adopted as follows ,Parallichthys olivaceus is single
cultured in cages, Holothuria sp. is one of the famous and precious aquatic
products in this area for the plentiful resource , sufficient non-seasonal fry
offering. Holothuria sp. is benthic omnivorous animal which can absorb and
decompose the remanent diet and feces subsided in the cage and need not other
diet. The culture of Holothuria sp. will play the role of biological purification
and improve the utilizing rate of diet and economic efficiency.
The cuiture of Lami7?ariajapontica is set in the east area of Rongcheng bay, and
it can not only prevent big wave and ensure the safety of cage, but also absorb
the surplus of N and P and keep good water quality and prevent eutrofication.
In the mariculture areas of Fujian ,it is suggested that the net cage mariculture
models are alternatively carried on with shellfish and algae. Such a space
cultivation with multi-species and multi-layers can not only clear up the
influences caused by the net cage mariculture, but also keep ecological balance.
It is a peculiar and effective ecological mariculture model.
21



1.6.2  Improvement of diet and feeding types in mariculture
Previously ,the food for net cage mariculture such as fresh small fish was placed
into the cages directly and then rapidly subsided. Actually only a little was fed.
It easily caused waste and water pollution.
Now frozen food pieces are adopted .They are easy to store and place into the
cages .This kind of feeds can float and stay on the water surface for a period of
time, therefore it can be easily fed to fish. They may be mixed with some
medicines and other things based on the demands .The utilization rate can be as
high as 95%, which will greatly reduce the degree of pollution caused by the
remanent diet in the water body and sediments. For the cage mariculture in large
scale the ideal feeds should be made of tasty diets according to the growth
requirement.  The diameter of diet pillet should be smaller than the size of fish
mouth, so that fish can easily takes them. The food amount should be
determined by feeding amount of fish. Normaly, the daily diet should be 5-
6% of the weight of fish. Feeding manner at present in the net cage mariculture
is by manual feeding. It is suggested that daily feeding times can be flexible and
adjusted based on the demand of fish growing. The automatic feeding instead of
manual feeding .
1.6.3  Fisheries environmental monitoring and pollution control
Fisheries environmental monitoring and pollution control are the environmental
management to prevent and lessen the impact of the project on environment.
In order to develop the mariculture health fully and to utilize sustainable coastal
resources, it is essential to establish some special fishery environmental
monitoring stations in the mariculture areas.  These monitoring stations have
been listed in the coastal zone management project.  The fishery environmental
monitoring stations should have corresponding technical staffs, monitoring
facilities and equipment and draw up the detailed monitoring plan.  The
monitoring items may include water quality, sediment quality, marine organisms,
some hydrological and meteorological factors as well as some virus, pathogenic
bacteria and parasite if necessary.  The monitoring plan should comprise
routine,  temporary  ,emergency  monitoring  and  environmental  status
investigation which is coordinated with scientific research and administrative
law enforcement. The fishery environmental monitoring will play an important
role in preventing and controlling marine pollution and preventing aquatic
diseases as well as improving yield and quality of aquatic products.
It is suggested that the following counter-measures for controlling the pollution
of fishery environment should be taken:
I.  To divide the coastal areas into different environmental functional districts
and to formulate the developing and utilizing program of fishery areas
according to the function and environmental protection objects of the areas
22



II. To determine the cultural capacity based on the environment and resource
characters of the area, and to choose suitable cultpral organisms which
have strong adaptability, easy culture and little impact on environment.
III. To strengthen the scientific research and to approach scientific cultural
model and method , especially in developing the research on cultural
ecological mode, so as to guide the cultivation scientifically and
quantitatively.
IV. To perfect the law and standard system of cultural environment
management and to enhance the managing level of cultural environment.
1.6.4  Biological treatment
If the organic waste in sediments under the cages has greatly influenced on yield,
-the waste should be removed or the net cage should be removed to a new
location.  It is suggested to use large funnel-shaped collector which may be
hung under the cage and to use a pump to stir up the waste in the mud.  The
experimental results show that the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus can be
reduced by 15-20% using this method. Meanwhile, 45% of solid waste can be
cleared.  Submersible electric stirring machines have been applied to disperse
the wastes in some countries, and it may reduce 60-75% of the sediment with 40
cm thickness. However, it may bring disadvantageous impact on environment
and organism. If the sediment environment is seriously polluted, a method of
pouring lime white into bottom can be used, and it makes lime white cover on
the surface of bottom and form a protecting layer. It may reduce the harm of
sediment environment pollution to mariculture.  It is suggested that the net
cage should be removed to a new site after 3-5 years of culture, and it can solve
the organic pollution of sediment thoroughly.  The sediments at the old site
can be treated by ploughing , paving sand, etc.

2.1.2 Program of prawn pond reconstruction and main technology
27



This project will carry out whole technical transformation for existed
prawn ponds and their fitted facilities based on drawing an experience and
a lesson at home and abroad in prawn farming, combine Thailand model
with national situation and local condition and according tb latest disease
preventive technique in prawn culture. The concrete plan is as follows:
reforming the prawn ponds from large one to small one, the rectangular to
the square, the shallow to the deep, the extensive culture to the intensive
culture, monoculture to polyculture and adopting an ecological farming
model.
In reconstructed prawn ponds semi-closed and recycled inside farming way
is adopted. The water from outside sea or the waste water discharged from
the prawn ponds goes into the water purifying ponds to sediment and be
purified biologically for more than 72 hours. Then the water is put into the
water disposing ponds to precipitate and be sterilized. After all of these
procedures, the water can be put into the prawn ponds for use.
The reconstruction plan of prawn pond with an area of 2 ha ( Tong-an
model) in Fujian province is shown in Fig.2.1.5.

*   Renovation of river course in the saltwater river basin in Weihai city,
Shandong province
The transformation of saltwater river basin is to increase ecological
purification effect in river course and fully play a superiority in smaller
prawn pond and adhere intensive culture and create a polyculture of prawn,
fish and shellfish in a pond.
29



A. The river course with an area of 200 ha. can be utilized continuously as
a store water pond.
B. The community structure of hydrophyte is optimized artificially in the
river course. It needs to provide salvaging vessels along the different parts
of the saltwater river. The salvaging vessels are used for salvaging silk
ribbon algae constantly from April to July so as to prevent its breeding
and spread, which lead to mosses death in large scale .Over salvaging will
loss mosses which has purifying water ability between June and July. It is
necessary to prevent it from rotting on the spot and ruining water quality.
C. It needs to provide 8 salvaging vessels and necessary affiliated
facilities on whole river section.
D. To carry out research and utilization for the salvaged hydrophyte.
In order to ensure a certain density of intensive culture and control
flexibly
E. The inlet and outlet of prawn pond and closed culture and properly convert it
so as to ensure stable water quality during the closed period, it is planed to
install aerators in total 200 prawn ponds with 4.5kw or7.5kw /ha.
It is required to arrange the bottom of prawn ponds so as to create  a
condition for polyculture of prawn ,fish and shellfish.
Reconstruction model of prawn pond along the coasts of Shandong
province and Liaoning province
When a large pond is converted into small ponds the ability of self
purification and sterilization is increased. The conversion system in which
a pond is divided into two or three ponds has been established in order to
culture prawn and shellfish separately and keep higher intensive culture
for prawn, meanwhile it also improves the discharged water quality.
(A) The part of large and rectangular prawn ponds is divided into two ponds,
of which one is used for water quality regulating as precipitation pond and
the other is used for polyculture of prawn and shellfish.

is used for mixed culture of prawn and fish and the third is used for shellfish
culture so as to improve the discharged water quality.
(C) In order to adjust the improper system of inlet and outlet, it needs to
excavate a new river course and install sluice gates with power facilities
for separating between inlet-and outlet.
(D) It is necessary to install aerators (4.5kw/ha) in order to keep higher
stocking density and production level.
0  Culture plan
In the reconstructed prawn ponds it takes prawn as major species and mixes
with a certain amount of mullet and Tilapia, etc. It mainly adopts a
biological purification method in the water purifying pond where a certain
amount of Bastard halibut, Puffer, clam and Sinonovacula constricta, etc.
There is one crop culture in the north part of China and two crops in
Fujian province.

For each pond, the sluice gates are installed at inlet and outlet in each
and a screen is installed on the inlet sluice gate.  Before stocking seeds
the ponds must be cleaned and sterilized by bleaching powder and the
sediments on the bottom will be removed and after the bottom being
exposed to sun-shine and being sterilized the purified sea water will be
31



filled into the pond and fertilizers will be applied into pond so as to form
natural food population and reproduce single cell algae. At the same time
some Nereis sp. is put into the pond as food of prawn and to purify the
bottom and consume residual food and detritus etc. After cleaning the
pond, it is deepened to 2-2.5 m and aerators are installed. 225,000 health
prawn seeds/ha. are stocked into the pond and it is not necessary to change
water by the end of June and water change amount/day does not go beyond
5% after July in order to optimize and stabilize the ecological environment
in prawn farming.
The food for the prawn pond is composed of natural food in pond, good
quality pellets and some fresh and living food. The completed nutritious
pellet is mainly composed of fish meal, peanut cake, soybean cake,(being
cooked),small shrimp, fish powder, trace elements, bonding agent and
antibiotics, etc .The food coefficient is 2-3 and 80% of food can be taken
in a rational feeding condition. This formulation can improve nutrition
and increase ability to prevent prawn disease. The technological
advantage of the reconstructed prawn pond accords with the requirement
of advanced technique of prevention and treatment of prawn disease at
present and it is easy to operate and manage .The deepened prawn pond
with small area and installation of aerator can keep the environmental
stability in prawn pond. The water purifying pond and disposing pond can
prevent the spread of disease and the waste water that is biologically
purified and treated by drugs can be recycled and used again .So only a
little bit of waste water is discharged and it lessens the pollution to marine
environment.
2.2 Engineering analysis on prawn pond reconstruction and hatchery
2.2.lEffluent amount, types of discharged waster water and pollutants,
and
properties in effluent
* Main kinds of pollutants and amount in the engineering of prawn pond
reconstruction
According to the engineering analysis on two types of prawn pond
reconstruction in Fujian province, the removed pollutants in the prawn
pond reconstruction are silts from the former pond. The removed silts
from pond is 500m3/ha.( 0.05 x 1000 );the total amount is 375,000m3 (750
x 500).Based on the monitoring results of bottom silts in the late of prawn
farming for the demonstration regions of comprehensive prevention and
32



treatment of prawn disease in Dongban and Qianting,Zhangpu,
Tongan,Xiamen in 1994,1995 and 1996 (a key project for prawn disease in
National Eight Five Plan),the average content of sulphide is 74mg/kg. In
addition, the research results concerned show that after 4 months rearing
prawn the organic carbon content in the bottom silts will be up to
3.1%.Therefore, the amounts of sulphide and organism can be calculated
to be 22.2 mt and 9,300mt respectively.
Calculation method:
= V,,x/ X(1-WHO) X W2 X1
Woc = V,, x 2000 x ( -WH,,,) x Woc
In which  Ws' ----Total amount of sulphide in removed silts( kg)

Ws'f  ---The average sulphide content of the dried silts (mg/kg)
Xoc ---- The average organic carbon content of the dried silts
(%)
2000 -----Silt weight/m3 (kg)
* The main kinds of pollutants and amount in the process of prawn farming
There are not large scale industrial and living pollution around the
reconstruction area of prawn ponds. According to a plan of pond which
returned to culture after reconstruction and technological analysis, the
pollutants from the prawn farming are . discharged water containing a
large number of organic matters and nutrient salts. Its main expression
shows  the  increase   of  contents  of  suspended   substance
(ss),BOD,COD,C,N,P. which may led to bloom of algae and result in poor
air circulation in water and reduce dissolved oxygen content and
deteriorate water quality, of which the organic matters are main pollutants
in water discharged from pond. The pollutants exist in the form of solution,
suspension and sedimentation in prawn pond and they are gradually
decomposed, converted and utilized by the aquatic life. Finally the
residues will be removed with discharged water and silts out of the
semi-closed system in pond and go into environment.
With aid of material balance method, The total nitrogen load is calculated
at 60kg/t(prawn),135kg/ha/yr,phosphorus load is about 28kg/t (prawn),
63kg/ha/yr in the process of prawn farming.
33



Calculation method:
Nitrogen load (T-N)= ( C X Nf - N b) X I O
Phosphorus load ( T - P )= (Cx P f- P b ) X o  Unit: kg/output (T)
In which
C: food coefficient (take 1.4)
Nf: Nitrogen content in food ( 6.4%)
N b: Mean nitrogen content in the body of prawn ( 2.96%)
P   Phosphorus content in food ( 2.2%)
P b Mean phosphorus content in the body of prawn ( 0.26%)
The organic matter in sea water is used to be calculated according to COD.
The COD content will change with the different stocking density and
feeding amount, meanwhile with the rearing time. Therefore the COD
content is various in the waste water of different pond and at different
time.
Based on the monitoring results of water in prawn ponds in Dongban and
Qiangting, Zhangpu, and Tongan, Xiamen in 1994,1995 and 1996,the
mean content of COD in the water discharged from pond is
2.34mg/L,however the mean content of COD in sea water is 1.35mg/L.
According to prawn farming model with middle stocking density in semi-
closed system, the drainage amount of prawn pond is as follows: It takes
adding water as major in early stage (20-30 days) and exchangeslo%
water a day in the middle and late stages (30-90 days).the exchange water
amount will be calculated according to water volume in pond x 2.
The total amount of effluents discharged from pond /ha with two crops a
year is (10,000 x 10% x 60 + 20,000) x 2 = 160,000 m3
The COD drainage amount in effluents is (2.34-1.35 ) x 160,000 = 158.4
kg/ha/yr.
Remove 0.05m silts in the prawn pond a yeas with 500m3/ha, of which
sulphide content is 29.6kg and organic matter content is 12,400 kg.
According to prawn culture plan, drug amount/ha/yr. for cleaning and
sterilizing prawn pond is 6,800 kg quick limes and 1,540 kg bleaching
powder.
* The main kinds of pollutants and amount in the hatchery
Based on analysis of technological process for breeding of fish, crab and
shellfish, the main pollutants in the hatchery'come from the nutrient salts
for   culturing   phytoplankton   and   residues   for   culturing
zooplankton ,residual phytoplankton and zooplankton, excreta of aquatic
life, remainders of artificial food in breeding of fish or crab and
disinfectants in prevention and treatment of dieseases,etc.
The calculation of drainage amount of effluents from a hatchery with an
34



area of 1400 m2 in breeding ponds and. with an annual capacity of
producing 10 million genuine porgy seeds (3 cm ) is as follow:
With water temperature of 16.0-21.0 °C ,fish can grow intp 1.2 cm in body
length and 0.02g in weight after 30 days rearing from hatching; it can
grow into 3.0cm in body length and 0.4g in weight after 50 days.
In 1-30 days, the total feeding amount is 3,300kg,of which  Artimnia
is 1,425 kg, Copepods 1,875 kg, bread yeast 5,737 kg. The yeast
contains 50% protein and the nitrogen content is 8% in calculation of K
6.25. The input total nitrogen is about 460 kg and the total phosphorus is
115 kg in calculation of 2 % phosphorus of artificial food .
In 30-50 days it mainly feeds minced fish (fresh food) with total demand
of 13,500 kg. The total nitrogen content is 337.5 kg, and total phosphorus
content is 54 kg in supplying minced fish in calculation of 2.5% nitrogen
and 0.4 phosphorus in the minced fish (fresh food).
The weight of 10 million genuine porgy seeds is 4,000 kg. The seeds
produced from the hatchery contain total nitrogen (T-N ) of 117.6 kg and
total phosphorus of 39.2 kg in calculation of 2.94 % nitrogen and 0.98%
phosphorus in the body of genuine porgy.
The input total amount of N, P deducts the stored amount in the body of
fish and its environmental load is the total nitrogen (T-N) of 685 kg and
the total phosphorus (T-P ) of 130 kg.
The calculation of effluent drainage amount during the period of breeding
is as follow:
The total water volume is 1,400 x 1.5 = 2,100 (m3) in calculation of
breeding pond with 1.5 m in deep.
Water exchange amount at the first stage 2,100 x 60% x30 =37,800( m3)
Water exchange amount at the send stage 2,100 x 40% x 20 = 16,800 (m3)
The nitrogen content can be about 13mg/L and phosphorus content is
about 2mg/L in effluent during the period of breeding.
The disinfectants can be used for sterilizing breeding pond and food pond
and a little of chemical drugs and antibiotics can be used for prevention
and treatment of disease such as quick lime, bleaching powder, formalin
and potassium permanganate, etc. Their concentration is as same as the
prawn farming , however their amount is less than  prawn pond due to
smaller water body in breeding.
The calculation of pollutant drainage amount from a hatchery with an area
of 3,000 m2 in breeding ponds and with an annual capacity of producing
1440 million seeds of Arca (500-800 il ) is as follow:
The feeding rate ( daily supplying amount/ daily feeding amount) is 1.5-
2.0, it needs to supply 50 t single cell algae/day. and the total feeding
35



amount is 50t x 60 = 3,000 t; the total nitrogen load is 27.1 kg, total
phosphorus is 2.7f kg in water flowing into environment, the nitrogen
content is increased by 0.lrmg/L, phosphorus content increased by
0.01mg/L in the discharged water in calculation of 80% absorbable rate
of single cell algae to N,P, 60% feeding rate and 20% conversion rate.
It is not necessary to use antibiotics and other chemicals in breeding of
arca besides disinfectants in cleaning pond.
* The pollutant properties discharged from the project of prawn pond
*             reconstruction and hatchery
There are three types of pollutants discharged from the prawn pond
reconstruction and hatchery, of which  the first is the decomposed
organic matters biologically(components of BOD),which consume oxygen
and release nutrient salts such as N and P, etc; the second is inorganic
nutrient salts from the culture of single cell algae, artificial food input and
excreta; C,N,P  are the growth elements for marine plant, which is
favorable to increase primary productivity level in sea area under suitable
contents,  however  over  inputting  nutrient  salts  will  led  to
eutrophication ;the third is disinfectants for prawn culture and breeding,
which are composed of lime ( quick lime and cooked lime) and bleaching
powder. The quick lime ( Ca0) will be soluble in water and release a large
amount of energy after cooked and it has strong effect of killing bacteria
in this process and produce Ca( OH )2 in solution which can quickly
dissolve bacterial protein membrane and result in losing its activity. The
lime can neutralize acidic matters in pond and promote organic
mineralization caused by anaerobic population on bottom and produce
nonpoisonous byproduct. However the insoluble phosphate being
produced in the process of using results in shortage of phosphorus in water
body which restrains growth of aquatic life. Main composition of
bleaching powder is CaCl ( OCI ) which produces hypochlorous acid
CI(OCI)-and initial ecological oxygen when it comes into water, it is
able to deoxidize plasma protein of bacteria and which leads to lose
function of active gene but it interacts with organic molecular in the
process of sterilization and produce poisonous by-products such as
.-organic chloride, acidic phloride, ammonia chloride, ammonium chloride,
etc.
2.2.2.Treatment plan of waste water
The culture model of semi-closed system with middle stocking density are
adopted in the project of prawn pond reconstruction. The main focal point
36



of this project is to construct newly the water purifying pond and deposing
pond. Some flat fish, globe fish, clam and Sinonovacula constricta are
stocked into the water pond purified biologically to consume residual
food in waste water, clam and Sinonovacula constricta cah filter out the
suspended matters and other particulates. The waste water being treated
by drugs can come into grow out pond again  so as to stabilize the
environment in the pond and prevent disease. The water exchange will be
carried out after stocking of one month and daily water exchange will be
not beyond 5% in order to optimize and stabilize the ecological
environment in prawn farming.
The purified waste water is filled into the disposing pond again to be
precipitated and sterilized by disinfectants and purified again. The water
that is in compliance with the requirement of water quality in the culture
pond will be filled into pond again. The disinfectant is bleaching powder,
the content of effective chlorine with o.5 PPM can kill single cell algae
and 1-2 PPM content can kill virus and pathogenic bacteria. The remained
content of chlorine shall be controlled between 0.5-1 PPM to meet the
requirements of water quality in culture pond.
Moreover ,Tilapia and mullet stocked in the prawn pond for intensive
culture are omnivorous, which can make full use of the surplus artificial
food and algae to clean water. However, the fish in the pawn pond not only
can prey on the weak prawn seeds, but also improve the prawn motion and
promote health growth and increase its ability for disease resistance. As a
result, disease occurrence in the prawn pond with stocked fish is much
less in the monoculture pond. Nereis sp. as a natural basic food can also
purify bottom and consume remanent food and detritus in water.
A part of silts removed from prawn pond are piled up on the dike to be
exposed to sunshine and a part of them are transported to behind of
house and another part of them are moved far from the prawn pond for
concentration and directly dumped into sea area.
There is a little of pollutants from a hatchery and they are discharged
directly in the normal condition . Part of hatcheries have small influent
treatment pond for collection of effluent and decompose the residual drugs
and prevent accident.

Tide
There is semi-diurnal tide along the coast of Fujian province besides
informal semi-diurnal tide and mixed tide in the south of Futou bay (the
south of Liujia peninsula ), of which there is obvious in shallow sea
branch tide behind estuary and harbor which belongs to informal semi-
diurnal tide and shallow sea tide.

* Water quality status
Most indexes of water quality in the tidal zone and along the coast of
Fujian province accord with the first class standard of sea water quality
and water quality in tidal zone and in a part of semi-closed bay exceeds
the standard caused by contaminants such COD matters and oils which
account for 90%.The project area polluted by oil is located in Meizhou bay
( within the project area of prawn pond reconstruction),Zhangbay of
Sansha bay to waters along, the Saizhi coast ( within the project area of
hatchery). The project area polluted by COD matters is located in Meizhou
bay and Sansha bay. The water quality around the project area is basically
not subject to pollution by heavy metals . The status of water quality is
shown in Table 2.6,2.7 and 2.8.

Zooplankton
There are complex compositions in species of zooplankton in sea areas
and 357 species have been identified, of which Copecoda is dominant
species, account for 28% ,Hydridae and jellyfish account for 19% and 33
species of fish eggs and Juveniles, account for 9.2%.
The zooplankton community is more complex in these sea areas and the
tropic. and subtropic species occupy dominant (74%).The mean total
biomass of zooplankton /month/year is 175mg/m3( excluding jellyfishes
and Thaliacea).The mean total biomass in spring is   265mg/m3 and the
total biomass in summer increases to peak a year. The mean is 272mg/m3,
The total biomass in autumn reduces to 113mg/m3 and the total biomss in
winter is minimum with 52mg/ m3.
Benthic life
There is higher amount of benthic life in sea area with the mean total
biomass of 41.93g/m2,the  mean total density  of 147ind./m2.In  the
composition   of  the   total   biomass   echinoderm   ranks   first
(19.75g/m2),accounts for 47% of the total biomass; mollusk ( 11.65g/m2)
accounts for 28% and the biomass of polychaete and crustacean is lower,
of 4.24g/m2 and 2.15g/m7 respectively. The distribution characteristics of
the total biomass and the total density show trend that increases from
45



north to south . There is the highest in the south part of sea area, with a
mean total biomass of 89.27g/m2 and a density of 178 ind./m2, lower in the
central part ( 37.15g/m2 and 159ind./m2) and the lowest in the north
( 19.06g/m2 and 104 ind.1m2) .
There is obvious seasonal change in the distribution of benthic life amount
and the highest in summer, follow in spring and autumn and the lowest in
winter whatever calculate the total biomass or the total density.
2.3.3 The project area in Liaoning province
* Geographical location
The project area for prawn pond reconstruction is situated in the south of
the Yingkou city with a total coastline of 23 km and 5,747ha. shallow sea.
The prawn ponds are located at the east of Yingkou saltfield and at the
west of Liaodong bay and there are salt and crystal ponds on the west and
east sides of the saltwater river. It has a optimal geographical position,
where there are very convenient in the communication of land, sea and air
and the Shenda motorway which traverses within the boundaries of this
area and a crisscross railway and two international commercial ports
( Yingkou port and Bayuquan port) , a good post and telecommunication
which has communicated directly with 198 foreign countries and regions
as well as 2,055 domestic cities and counties.
* The present status of hydrography
The hydrographic condition is an important environmental factor for
marine life and has an important effect on the migration, distribution,
breeding and growth of fish. There is an irregular semidiurnal tide in this
area with the mean tidal range of 4.5 m. The main river is the Daliao River
with a mean runoff amount of 1,340 million m3/year.The salinity range all
the year round  is 26.9-31.4 °oo and the average 29.4 °/0 and the
transparency is 1.6m.The water temperature is affected greatly by land.
Water temperature is basically as same from surface to bottom in winter
and the isotherms parallel basically with isobanths. The water temperature
increases markedly in summer. The mean highest annual temperature is 23
°C( August),the mean lowest annual temperature is -2.0 C( February) and
the mean annual temperature is 10.9 'C.
46



* The present status of water quality
Water quality in the saltwater river is an important as the water source for
farming area. The saltwater river system is restricted by the saltfields and
the variance in water quality exists in different time, which is mainly
dependent on the water flow and water exchange amount. The indexes that
are subject to change ate COD and transparency. If the saltfields do not
release water for a long time it will reduce the water level of river and
flow speed and increase COD and reduce transparency due to the increase
of biomass. In addition, a large number of soil and sand on both sides of
river flow into the river after rainfall ,which result in this situation as
above mentioned.
However, it is temporary in these changes and   influences water
exchange in prawn pond occasionally. The on-the-spot investigations for
water quality of the saltwater river were carried out in March and June to
August 1996, separately.
The results of investigation to the saltwater river in March show that all
indexes meet the standard of fishery water quality, except copper content
which exceeds a little, referring to Table 2.10.  On the whole, the water
quality of the saltwater river is a good and ammonia nitrogen in cultured
water has not yet been discovered and the sulphide had not been measured

There is a certain variance in water quality in different time ( from June to
August) of farming. The dissolved oxygen content is usually above
6.5mg/i, pH 8.1-8.9 and ammonia nitrogen is not found before the end of
July and is found after that and the highest value is 0.105 mg/l. The mean
value of total nitrogen is 0.049 mg/l and accords with the first class of
water quality in aquaculture. The mean value of soluble phosphate is
47



0.036mg/l which reaches to the second class of sea water quality. The
salinity change from  30.0 %o to 15.5 %0o,influenced by rainfall, and water
temperature ranges from 22.5 to 26.5 'C. COD ranges from 2.62-5.18 mg/.
The transparency can be up to 1.0m in sunny day and the transparency
declines influenced by sludge usually, but it can be renewed in a short
time.
All indexes as above mentioned meet the requirements of water quality in
aquaculture. The water quality status at various stages is shown in Table
2.11.
* The presepit status of water quality along the coast
The surveying results along the coast of the project area and neighboring
sea waters based on ten stations in May 1997 show that the contents of
heavy metals and oil are much lower and other indexes are in normal
level .All indexes in the survey accord with the standard of sea water
quality and the demand of aquaculture. The results of survey are shown in
Table 2.12.

Bacillariophyceae occupies an absolute dominant position in quantity and
species in number of phytoplankton and it is a main component for
deciding the change and distribution of total number of phytoplankton.
The main species are Coscinodicus sp.,Chaestoceros sp.,Rhizosolenia sp.
and Skeletonemaa costatum.
Zooplankton
The annual average zooplankton biomass is about 149mglm3.Copepoda
accounts for 50% and the others are Chaelognatha, Jullyfish and plankton
larvae. The seasonal variation of the average zooplankton biomass is that
the highest value occurs in summer and the lowest value in winter or.
spring. See Table 2.16.

Because the coastal area of project possesses a special condition of inner
sea, the species composition is featured by 'the low salinity offshore
species. Sagitta crassa and Labidocera euchaeta occupy the dominant
position almost all the year round, only the number variation of both
species shows a seasonal difference. The other middle-size zooplankton is
mainly consisted of Centropages m1murrichi, Tortanus spini-caudatus,
Acartia pacific and Acartia bifilosa.

and No.2 monitoring points of Donglin in 1997. Therefore, the main
contaminants are nutrient salts in this sea area.
*  The status of aquatic life
Based on the analysis of environmental monitoring data along the coast of
Rudong county, Nantong city ,carried out by East China Sea Fisheries
Research Institute in July 1997, the main features of aquatic life in the
coastal waters nearby hatcheries and aquatic products process plants are as
follows:
Phytoplankton
The mean total cell number of phytoplankton in the investigated waters is
2.27 x106 cell/m3 and it ranges from 393 x103 to 7097 x 103 cell/m3.The
horizontal distribution of biomass is higher in north than in south of the
investigated waters. There are 38 species of phytoplankton, in which
diatom occupies dominant, accounting for 92%.It is mainly consisted of
eurythermal and euryhaline species, of which Skeletonema costatum
dominates and Chaetoceros lorenzianus follows.
Chlorophyll a
There is a plentiful nutrient salt in the surveyed waters and is high content
of chlorophyll a with 22.77mg/i in the bloom of phytoplankton. The mean
value is 16.43/1 during the period of rising tide,22.02mg/l during the
period of falling tide and the minimum is 7.59mg/l.
Zooplankton
The mean total biomass of zooplankton is 173.96mg/m3 in this water area
and it ranges from 24.75 to 602.25 mg/m3. There are 35 specie of
zooplankton identified, in which Copepoda dominates and ten species
account for 38%, two species of Mysis. There is low salinity species as
major in the species composition of zooplankton and the dominant species
is Tortanus derjugini and Labidocera eachaeta.The maximal number of
them are 126.92ind./m3 and 81.67 ind./m3,respectively.
The shallow waters along north coast of Jiangsu province is a good
spawning ground. According to the analytical result of investigation, there
are much fish eggs and larvae in this area,mainly cosisting of larvae and
eggs of anchovy and a little of juveniles or larvae and eggs of croakers.
Benthic life in tidal zone
There are 18 points on two sections with 11 km in investigation of tidal
52



zone. The mean benthic invertebrate and habitat density are 35 g/m2 and
41.24 ind./m2,respectively. There are 45 species identified, in which
mollusk dominates,  crustacean and polychaeta follow. The dominant
species is consisted of neanthes japoica,Lumbrineris heleropoda and
meretrix meretrix, etc.
2.4 Environmental Impact of prawn pond reconstruction and hatchery
2.4.1 Environment Impact Assessment on use of disinfectant
The disinfectants are used to eliminate the pathogenic bacterial ,remove
wild algae and enemies for the purpose of cleaning and sterilizing pond,
and prevention and treatment of disease. The commonly used drugs are
consisted of quick lime, bleaching powder, tea seed cake and CuSO4,etc.
The potassium permanganate is also used to sterilize the hatchery. The
cooked lime ( lime water), active zeolite ,etc are used to purify and
improve water quality in the process of culture. Antibiotics are used with
mixed food according to its dosage in prevention and treatment of disease.
The disinfectants can reduce the content of pathogenic microorganisms in
water environment and biological contamination in water, especially in
the break out of disease a strict sterilization measure is adopted usually so
as to prevent or minimize the extension of diseases. However, the residue
of disinfectants has also an unfavorable effect on aquatic products,
human body and environment. These are as follows:
(1) Some disinfectants ,such as bleaching powder, quick lime, antibiotics,
etc. kill other non target organisms, algae zooplankton, etc. in the pond,
meanwhile they also kill pathogenic bacterial due to their a wide
sterilization. The original wild life community is subject to damage and
reduce the stability of ecological system in the prawn pond and obstruct
the circulation of material and energy partially and accelerate the
deposition of organic contaminants in the prawn pond.
(2)A part of drug residues within the body of cultured organisms is
harmful to human body before being decomposed when it has been eaten
by people. Japan, U.S.A, etc have forbidden to import the cultured prawn
that contains exceeded standard of antibiotics content.
The chlorinated disinfectants produce a poisonous by-product in the
process of sterilization when they are  interacted with organic matter. It
has a strong poisonous effect and causes cancer. The active zeolite and
quick lime belong to a natural mineral and the content of some heavy
metals is also abnormal due to different materials and processing methods.
53



These chemicals and antibiotics are discharged into natural waters with
prawn pond water will be possible to deteriorate the environment in a
short or in a long time if they are in high concentration.
2.4.2 Environmental Impact Assessment on the waste water drainage of
prawn pond
The waste water discharged from prawn pond mainly contains organic or
inorganic nutrients such as C, N, P,COD, BOD, SS, ect. However, The
amount of waste water discharged from the prawn pond can be reduced to
a large extent after reconstruction. The content of organics and nutrient
salts in the discharged waste water can be declined by rearing shellfish for
water purification. Some factors reducing the level of contamination are as
follows:
Firstly, the reasonable layout of reconstruction area of prawn ponds has
been carried out by dividing one pond into two or three ponds or arranging
the water purifying pond and the disposing pond for stocking prawn and
shellfish, respectively so as to increase self purification and sterilization
and improve the discharged water quality and reducing the impact of
discharged water on the environmental waters. Secondly, it adopts semi -
closed and recycled farming model with installation of aerators after
reconstruction. The waste water discharged from pond can be recycled by
biological purifying and sterilizing and only little of the waste water in
pond ( water exchange a day is less than 5% after July) is discharged,
which is much less than that of the former prawn pond and it has much
less impact on environment. Thirdly ,based on the reconstruction model of
prawn pond in Fujian province ( i.e. prawn farming model of semi-closed
and middle stocking density),in the drainage amount of contaminants from
prawn pond the total nitrogen content is 135 kg/ha/yr. and COD 158.4
kg/ha./yr., if the total drainage amount of waste water from prawn pond is
160,000 m3/ha./two crops/yr. The increased volume of the total nitrogen in
the waste water is 0.84 mg/l and the total is 0.39mg/I and COD
0.99mg/l( It means that the increased volume is resulted from self
pollution in pond, excluding self-content of water in the sea
area.).Compared with other contamination-source, there is less
contamination in the prawn pond after reconstruction and it is limited to
make a contribution to eutrophic level in waters. However, in the program
of prawn pond reconstruction the water in the prawn pond is treated
through the water purification before drainage and then is discharged into
environment. Its concentration will be reduced to a large extent because a
part of nutrient matters is further decomposed and converted into
54



something be utilized by shellfish in the pond. The contamination level of
waste water from pond on environment will be minimized with
improvement of food quality and management level.
2.4.3 Environment Impact Assessment on the waste water drainage of
breeding
The kinds of contaminant and properties in the waste water of breeding are
similar to the culture of prawn. The negative impact on the environment is
also a problem of organic contamination and eutrophication. Based on
calculation of drainage volume and concentration of main contaminants, it
shows that there is little of environmental loads of the total nitrogen and
total phosphorous in the process of shellfish breeding and the contents of
the total nitrogen and the total phosphorus are increased by O.lmg/l and
0.01 mg/l, respectively. It is not considered to be a new source of
pollution because of small water body of breeding.
In the process of fish breeding the total nitrogen and total phosphorous
loads are more than those of shellfish breeding because there are much
more yeast for culturing zooplankton and low utilized rate of minced fish
( fresh food) in the culture of post larvae. The increased volume of
nitrogen and phosphorous in the waste water of breeding is estimated at
12.5mg/l and 2.4mg/I, respectively because the residues and excreta in the
process of breeding remain for a short time (about 3-5 days) and most of
organics are discharged into environment before being decomposed and
consume a large number of dissolved oxygen in water. Therefore, it will
pay attention to the organic contamination in the waste water of fish
breeding in a place where there is a poor water source.
In addition, it will pay attention to the higher concentration of
disinfectants( bleaching powder, potassium permanganate,etc.) in
cleaning hatchery, especially in mass cleaning pond and break out of
diseases. The residual content of chemicals and antibiotic is higher in the
waste water discharged and it is harmful to aquatic life in the received
waters directly. It is not treated by decomposition.
The construction engineering has included the water purifying pond and
disposing pond for the waste water of breeding in the project of shellfish
hatchery. However, it is not mentioned in the facilities of fish (crab)
breeding and the disinfected water will be discharged after the
decomposition of efficacy of a drug.
2.5 Impact assessment of environmental pollution on breeding
Breeding is closely related to the water quality of located zone and most of
55



something be utilized by shellfish in the pond. The contalrination level of
waste water from pond on environment will be minimized with
improvement of food quality and management level.
2.4.3 Environment Impact Assessment on the waste water drainage of
breeding
The kinds of contaminant and properties in the waste water of breeding are
similar to the culture of prawn. The negative impact on the environment is
also a problem of organic contamination and eutrophication. Based on
calculation of drainage volume and concentration of main contaminants, it
shows that there is little of environmental loads of the total nitrogen and
total phosphorous in the process of shellfish breeding and the contents of
the total nitrogen and the total phosphorus are increased by O.lmg/l and
0.01 mg/l, respectively. It is not considered to be a new source of
pollution because of small water body of breeding.
In the process of fish breeding the total nitrogen and total phosphorous
loads-are more than those of shellfish breeding because there are much
more yeast for culturing zooplankton and low utilized rate of minced fish
( fresh food) in the culture of post larvae. The increased volume of
nitrogen and phosphorous in the waste water of breeding is estimated at
12.5mg/l and 2.4mg/I, respectively because the residues and excreta in the
process of breeding remain for a short time (about 3-5 days) and most of
organics are discharged into environment before being decomposed and
consume a large number of dissolved oxygen in water. Therefore, it will
pay attention to the organic contamination in the waste water of fish
breeding in a place where there is a poor water source.
In addition, it will pay attention to the higher concentration of
disinfectants( bleaching powder, potassium permanganate,etc.) in
cleaning hatchery, especially in mass cleaning pond and break out of
diseases. The residual content of chemicals and antibiotic is higher in the
waste water discharged and it is harmful to aquatic life in the received
waters directly. It is not treated by decomposition.
The construction engineering has included the water purifying pond and
disposing pond for the waste water of breeding in the project of shellfish
hatchery: However, it is not mentioned in 'the facilities of fish (crab)
breeding and the disinfected water will be discharged after the
decomposition of efficacy of a drug.
2.5 Impact assessment of environmental pollution on breeding
Breeding is closely related to the water quality of located zone and most of
55



project sites is located in the coastal harbors with good water quality and
are far away from the estuary of inner bay. It is necessary to reduce water
pollution for breeding as much as possible. Most of hatcheries are located
in the tidal zone and the contamination of water off shore has not exceeded
the standard of water, belonging to the first class water quality zone.
There are good water exchange and a large environmental capacity in the
most of places where good water quality can be kept for a long time to
accord with requirements of breeding.
However, the water area nearby some hatcheries such as along the coast of
Rudong county, Jiangsu province and along the coast of Zhangwan and
Guizhi,Ningde,Fujian province) results in contents of COD and oil in
water of branch tidal zone along the coast -exceeding the standard due to
influents discharged from ships and marine fish farms. The impacts on the
breeding are as follows:
(1) The concentration increase of organic nutrient matter in sea water
strengthens the survival ability of some pathogenic bacterial  and it is
more difficult for prevention and treatment of disease in the process of
breeding.
(2) The nutrient salts released by organic matter and a large number of
excreta of cultured organisms, vitamin and biological additives in
artificial food stimulate bloom of some species to form a red tide. The red
tide water has a toxin to fish ( crab), and shellfish and the toxic red tide is
more harmful to organisms.
(3) The sea water polluted by oil not only changes water property and
accelerates eutrophication, but also the toxic matters of oil such as
ammonia nitrogen, phenols, sulphide and cancerogenic substances such as
benzopyrene 3,4 and benzanthracenel,2 damage the composition of
endonuclease and protein in the body of organism.
In addition, a phenomenon commonly exists in the prawn culture in recent
year in Fujian province, i.e. under an abnormal climate condition, for
example , much of cultured prawn die in succession due to disease after
typhoon or storm, it encounters the same destiny in breeding operation.
This is possibly related to air pollution, acid rain and land contaminants
which are run to sea by surface runoff but it is not clear for the kinds of
contaminants and their mechanisms which lead to death of organism.
Therefore, The pollution of large environment has maximal impact on
breeding production.
2.6  Suggestions and mitigation measures
These environmental problems involved in management of marine
56



2.6  Suggestions and mitigation measures
These environmental problems involved in management of marine
aquaculture include man-made enivironmental problems an,d problems on
distribution of natural environmental elements and change patterns. In
addition, it also involves self pollution in mariculture.
Because there are no large scale industries and living pollution, the impact
of sea area environment is self-pollution problem in mariculture.As for
above mentioned, the suggestions and measures are pointed as follows.
2.6.1 Drawing up management plan
The government at various level shall make out an overall plan
reasonably and scientifically for shallow sea, beach and ponds under
their jurisdiction and avoid conflicts among the exploitation and
-utilization of resources, estimate the carrying capacity in area of prawn
culture scientifically and reasonably arrange the species of culture, rearing
area and stocking density.
It is necessary to strengthen monitor and management of fishery
environment in order to assess objectively and forecast unfavorable effect
and take necessary measures and limit them into acceptable level.
2.6.2 Improvement of culture technique
In the situation of prevalent prawn disease it must adhere to carry out
semi-closed farming model with installation of aerators and. keep a
reasonable stocking density and apply photosynthetic bacteria which not
only improve and stabilize the culture environment  and prevent and
treat disease, but also is used as food and food additive and promote
growth of fish and prawn, and effectively improve water quality and
bottom environment of pond and put off occurrence of disease. It needs to
select good food and health prawn seeds, and chemicals and antibiotics
are seldomly used as less as possible. The interfarming of other species
and culture in rotation are carried out so as to be fully utilized in the
man-made semi-closed system and minimize waste water drainage to
environment. In addition, the mixed disinfectant with Cd02 as main
component replaces bleaching powder in water quality treatment and
cleaning and sterilizing pond.
2.6.3 Disposal of removed silts in prawn pond during the process of
reconstruction
During the period of prawn pond reconstruction it needs to remove a large
quantity of silts from the prawn pond. Because the silt contains a large
57



amount of organics such as metabolites and remanent diet, they will
seriously impact on water quality of neighboring waters, caused by loss of
silts if a preventive measure is not carried out. For this reason, it should
adopt a certain preventive measures for transporting the removed black
silts on surface of bottom far away from the farming area and it will not
influence on en-ironment due to the loss of silts.
2.6.4 To strengthen training of technical force
A success of any mariculture project will be dependent on the skill and
experience of workers. In the same area and same natural conditions the
different effect and environmental effect are resulted from the different
techniques and management methods. Therefore, to gradually improve
technical and management level of farmers is an important key for
promoting the economy of mariculture and ecological benefits and
enforcing sustainable development of ecological aquaculture .
2.6.5 Improvement of operation system
At present, most of hatcheries and prawn ponds have been run by
individual or inpartnership with low educational level and shortage of
technique and fund, and they have no ability to renew equipment and
reconstruct prawn ponds. Up to today, most of prawn ponds have not been
fitted with advanced equipment and technique ,only depended on natural
conditions and there is a large loss in culture production. In the future the
aquaculture shall be run by the stock enterprises in individual operation
and managed by prawn farmer with good educational level and skills so as
to put the culture of prawn and seed up to a new level and do
environmental protection well.
2.6.6 Control of contaminant drainage
Living sewage and industrial effluent will be discharged according to the
standard, and the total volume of contaminant drainage will also be
controlled in the area of culture, especially to strictly control toxicants
and  harmful matters such as metallic elements, phenols, oils and
polychlorobiphenyl, etc. to be discharged to farming sea area. Otherwise
they will be harmful to human being by the way of deposition of cultured
organism and convey of food chain. The station for waste water treatment
must be established in the newly constructed hatchery, the size of which
will be as same as a factory. The waste water will be discharged on sea
area after being exposed to air, precipitated, and treated chemically and
biologically. The environmental protection departments will control not
58



only living sewage and industrial waste water, but also farming effluents.
To strengthen propagation and education, and to improve the
environmental awareness of farmer. It is necessary to shoe clearly the
reason of pollution caused by aquaculture and results to broad farmers.
Let them to recognize that utilization of resources is as important as the
protection of resource and environment, conscientiously maintain
ecological environment of aquaculture and struggle against a harmful
behavior that is absorbed in immediate interest to sacrifice environment.
Meanwhile It needs to understand the way of pollution in sea environment
and dangers to aquaculture and increase self resistant to risk of pollution,
for example, a large number of contaminants on land run to offshore area
so as to increase sharply content of contamination in seawater after
typhoon and storm. At this time it shall stop water inlet to avoid a
disastrous effect on breeding and aquaculture. The training courses should
be held regularly in a place with good conditions. In the training course
the environment protection will be one of the important contents for
increasing the environmental awareness of all farmers.

3.     Environment Impact Assessment on Aquatic Product Processing
Plant
3.1    General situation
In the recent years, with the development in economy in China the quality of
processed aquatic products demanded by people is going up higher and higher,
and various processing plants have emerged accordingly. Based on the data
collected, the processed seafoods dominate the market. The plants are mainly
scattered along the regions of coast. The enterprises are of medium or small-
sized, but highly potentialized for development. Particularly, a slight
improvement or modification of processed products to satisfy the consumers
requirement will readily bring about high economic efficiency. The industrial
pollutants discharged from the plants are mainly of COD (Chemical Oxygen
Demand), BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand), and other biological suspensions,
which can be removed by two stages of sedimentation and then by the
microbiological treatment to reach the release standard for pollutants, so there
will be no significant influence on environment.
3.1.1  Name, location and system of ownership of plants
Totally, there are 14 plants are to be reconstructed or expanded in the project,
in which eleven (11) in Fujian Province and one (I) each in Yingkou City of
Liaoning Province, Rongcheng City of Shandong Province, and Rudong County
of Nantong City. The project includes the reconstruction and expansion of cold
processing plant for seafoods, the purpose of which is to expand the local
processing plant and promote both domestic and foreign trades of seafoods. As
to the system of ownership, some are state ownership, some collective and
some limited-liability company. The riame, location and system of ownership of
plants are given in Table 3.1.
3.1.2 Size, Area and Plane Layout of Plants
The plants in this project are the enterprises of medium or small size. They are
mainly located in the suburbs of city with plentiful land resources and so occupy
a vast area of land to allow them for augmentation of facilities for sewerage
disposal and let sewerage released after sufficient treatment. The details are
shown in Table 3.2.
The plane layout of workshop in the plant meets the requirements for food
technological process in order to assure continuous production without blind
angle and crisscross contamination, that will reduce energy waste due to the
repeated operations. Fig 3.1 shows the general plane layout for processing
plants.

3.1.3   Land Utilization and Future Scale of Productivity
In the plant area, in addition to the ground area occupied by workshops,
administration building, cold storage, and such rooms for necessary facilities as
machine room, warehouse, etc., it also should have some spacious and open
ground for sun drying, planting trees and flowers to beautify the environment,
and transportation. Obviously, it varies with the product processed by the
different processing plant. For instance, a vast area of open ground is needed
for sun drying in the algae processing plant, but the pretreatment for minced
fish (kamaboko) products should be operated within the house. Table 3.2 lists
the details for the land area occupied in each plant.
Affected by such factors as management stratagem, invested funds,
consumption market and source of raw materials, the development between the
plants is not in equality, and accordingly their investment, productivity, scale of
development, etc. are quite different. The scale of development of each plant is
shown in Table 3.2.

3.1.4  Product Assortment and General Technology
To suit the market demand is a manifestation of the processing plant, i.e.
producing seafoods of excellent quality, satisfying the majority of consumers
requirement and meeting the market demand. Therefore, a rich and varied
processing industry is formed. The assortments of seafood are many and varied
in the province, such as:
processed fish products mainly including fish noodle, fish cake, fish ball, baked
and roasted fillet, canned whole fish, dried fish floss, etc. ; processed
cephalopod products including flavored squid slices, frozen octopus cuts, etc.;
processed shrimp or prawn products including flavored raw shrimp or prawn,
baked fresh shrimp, frozen shrimp, shrimp flavor condiments, dumpling with
shrimp meat, shrimp meat noodle (ball and cake) , etc.; processed shellfishes
products mainly including dried Pacific long oyster, oyster paste, canned oyster,
IQF Pacific oyster, dried green mussel, dried clam meat, dried razor clam, etc.;
processed crab products mainly including frozen crab lump, frozen crab meat,
crab ball, crab paste, canned crab meat. ect.; processed algae products mainly
including dried salted or fresh kelps, knotted kelps, sliced kelps, canned kelp,
nonsalted laver, laver paste, flavored laver, instant laver, etc. Typically, the
products mentioned above are processed with a general character in technology,
i.e.
* Frozen products technology
raw material---washing---mixed with condiments---frozen---glazed---taken
off tray---inspection---packaging---frozen
* Dried products technology
raw material---washing---mixed with condiments---drying or sun drying --
-packaging---storage
* Canning technology
raw  material---washing---mixed  with condiments---canning---sealing---
pasteurization---inspection---packaging
Because of various formulation in condiment mixing technology the finished
products processed and produced may vary in flavor with different or even
same plant.
3.1.5  Number of Employe and Living Area
The production capacity, management ability and utilization ratio of raw
material in a plant are determined to a large extent by the proper arrangement of
employe in the plant. Hence, the plant emphasizes on the seasonal employment
of casual laborers in addition to the permanent employes. That means recruiting
casual laborers from society to alleviate the tension state of production and
dismissing them when the harvest season is over. That is why the number of
67



employes in many plants is in fluctuation. The total number of employes:
including seasonal employment of laborers is 2964 as shown in Table 3..3. As
Food Sanitation Law in China stipulated, the living area for employes should be
entirely separated from the plant area in order to protect from crisscross
contamination, so no living area is allowed to set up in the plant area.

*   waste residues
There are two kinds of residues mainly left over from the processing plant
in which the edibles can be processed to animal feeds or additives in the
formulated feedstuff for fish, shrimp, etc..  The nonedibles may deeply
buried in the earth or directly used as agricultureal fertilizer.  Another
kind of residues is coal dregs from boiler which are generally used as road
pavement material or making coal-dreg bricks.

3.2.3  Quantity of pollutants discharged, released manner and pollutant features
Both industrial waste water and living sewage form main pollutants discharged
from the processing plant. The daily quantity of sewage discharged from  14
plants is about 3,500 MT, in which the concentration of COD in washing water is
about 30-60mg/L which is equivalent to 0. 21 MT maximum daily discharged.
The industrial waste water is constituted of nutritional washing water after fish,
shrimp and shellfish washing which essentially contains pollutants of COD, BOD,
volatile acids, suspensions, etc., but no heavy metals or other toxicants are
present.  These  pollutants  are  readily  decomposed  by  oxidation  and
microbiological degradation. By simple treatment in a processing station the
industrial  sewage  may  reach  the  following  standard.COD<150mo/L,
BOD<600mg/L, SS<IOOmg/L, and pH6-9 and then be released . Moreover, there
are miscellaneous residues in the processing plants including shells, fish skins,
viscera, etc. Some plants use electricity as heat energy and thus reduce the air
pollution or oil as fuel to supply energy. Coal and oil are supplied by the coal
suppliers or fuel companies. Coal and oil supplied all meet the fuel standard, so
waste gas exhausted from combustion contains smoke, dust and matters of
incomplete combustion which can be processed with sedimentation and filtration
to reach the indexes stipulated in GBT14-73 standard and then be released.
3.2.4 Programme for wastes treatment
* waste gas
The combustion of coal fuel is applied to supply heat energy in some of the
processing plants. Smoke-dust in waste gas can be removed by two stage
sedimentation system through Model XZZ Cyclone Duster for the first stage
and then through the second duster to make the concentration of smoke-dust
200mg/in' reaching GB 13721-91 standard.



*   waste residues
There are two kinds of residues mainly left over from the processing plant
in which the edibles can be processed to animal feeds or additives in the
formulated feedstuff for fish, shrimp, etc..  The nonedibles may deeply
buried in the earth or directly used as agricultureal fertilizer.  Another
kind of residues is- coal dregs from boiler which are generally used as road
pavement material or making coal-dreg bricks.

* waste water
Two kinds of industrial waste water come from the processing plant. One
is waste water from raw material washing which consists of coarse
particulates, no harmful-and toxicant soil and sands, and soluble organics in
less amount.  In general, it can be directly released through sedimentation



of coarse particulates, such as waste water from kelp, fish and shellfish
washing.  Another one is rinsing water in the process which contains much
organics and suspensions of small particulates with high fluctuation in pH.
Waste water of this kind should be sufficiently sedimented, degraded, pH
adjusted nearly to neutrality, sufficiently aerated to make the concentration
of COD and BOD meet the stipulated standard and then be released.  Fig
3.2 and 3.3 show the flow diagram of industrial sewage processed in most
of the plants.

The water quality in the waters of the project area in Fujian province is
good. The indexes of pH, BOD, COD, oil, Cu, Pb and Cd are meeting the
first class standard of sea water quality.  The contents of inorganic
nitrogen and phosphorus in seawater are the main indexes in excess of the
standard.  The content of inorganic nitrogen in sea area of the processing
project located basically excceeds the standard stipulated.  The content of
inorganic phosphorus in sea area of Funing Bay of Xiapu, Xinhua Bay,
Meizhou Bay and Xiamen Outer Port also exceeds the first class standard of
seawater quality.  Moreover, the content of inorganic phosphorus in the
sea area of Fujian bay and Xiamen Outer Port even exceeds the second class
standard of seawter quality.
In summer, the water quality of sea area where the processing project of
Fujian province is located is fairly good and reaches the standard of second
class of seawater quality.
*   Yinkou City of Liaoning Province
Water quality status in Liaodong Bay
The water quality status in Liaodong Bay and the fluctuations over the past
seven years are given in Tab3.8 and Tab 3.9.
It can be seen from Tab.3.8 that the pollutants in Liaodong Bay in excess of
77



the standards are inorganic nitrogen, inorganic nitrogen, inorganic
phosphorus, oils and COD. Heavy metals , however, don't exceed the
standards. The reason for the case is most likely that after being discharged
from land pollution sources, the pollutants of Cu, Pb and so on could be
deposited with suspended particulates in the form of solid on the seabed
nearby the river mouth. However, this situation could lead to sedimentary
pollution in some river mouth or in the vicinity of polllutant releasing
mouth.
As shown in Tab3.9, the major pollution factors in Liaodong Bay were
inorganic nitrogen and oils before 1991, and are inorganic nitrogen and
phosphorus after 1991.

3.3.4  Socio- economic
By the statistical data of 1990, the land area along the coast in Fujian province
covers 29,361 km2 , accounding for 23.75% of the land area with a population
of 1,660.99 x 104 that accounts for 55.5% of the whole provincial population.
The average density of population is 653.4/ kM2, higher than that of provincial
population of 247/km2.  The majority of people along the coast is the Han
nationality, adopting the Han culture with traditional customs and habits as well
as humanities and landscapes.  The popular dialect consists of a family of
Minnan, Fuzhou and Pudian languages.
Since the reformation and open door policy were carried into effect, the coastal
area in Fujian have attained tremendous achievements in economy and social
development based on the superiorities of location, marine resources, oversea
Taiwanese, and high development in various industries and enterprises. Now
the province has become an area with the most vigorous vitality in economic
development and most broad propects.  In 1990, the total industrial and
agricultural outputs in the coastal area amouted to CNY45.193 billion in which
the industrial output was CNY33.216 billion and the agricultural output
CNY11.975 billion. The total industrial output in the coastal cities was much
over the agricultural output and became an important pillar in economy. The
structural proportion of three industrial categories has been changed from
34:40:26 in 1978 to 20:47:33.  The industrial structure has been becoming
intact and perfect.  An industrial system of emphasis on light processing
industry and coordinative development of energy and material industries is
preliminarily formed.  At present, the coastal area in the province has owned
more than 30 categories of industry, commerce, and services, including
agriculture, industry, ore and mineral exploitation, architecture, transportation,
communication, merchandise circulation, tourism service, etc.
The regions where the processing projects in Fujian province are located are in
excellent economic status and speedily developed with no impoverished city,
county and district.
* Yingkou City of Lianning province
I.  Administrative division and population
Yingkou has four districts and two cities (at county level). The city
area covers 5,402 km2 with a population of 2.18 million, in which 40
X  103 people are fishermen.   The density of population is
403.55/km2.
II. Economy in 1996
In 1996, the total value of social output in Yingkou was CNY20,400
million; the value of agricultural output was CNY2,040 million, 28.7%
79



of them being fishery output (CNY580 million).  At the provincial
level, fishery output accounts for less than 10% of agricultural output.
It can be drawn from the case that people in seaYood production, i.e. in
marine culture, marine catches or processing, earn more than those in
agriculture and even in industry.
III. Communications
Along with the economic development in Yingkou, communications
have been developed speedily. Telecommunication has been widely
used.  Domestic and international direct-dials are commonly used.
In some government departments and business enterprises, fax
machine  and  E-mail  are  becoming  necessary  facilities  for
communication.
At present, the direct communication by telephone with 2055 cities or
counties at home and 188 countries abroad has been realized in
Yingkou City.  Besides, Yingkou has also set up the business of
movable phone, wireless communication, and domestic/international
special express mail.
The plant is about 50 km apart from Bayuquan port, 160 km away
from Shenyang city, and 200 km away from Dalian City by highway.
There are international airports setup in both two cities.
In addition to the favorable traffice situation by sea and highway, the
geographical location of the plant is also favorable.  The plant is
nearby the areas of raw material production.
Raw materials, finished productions, ice and packaging materials are
handled manually or by means of small hand-pushed or -pulled carts.
IV. Family size and net income per capita
Based on the data collectd from two urban districts (Laotian and
Bayuquan) and two cities ( Gaizhou and Dashiqiao), family size is 3.5
persons, lower than at national level(3.7 persons). In terms of net
income per capita, it varies greatly with six administrative divisions
under the jurisdiction of Yingkou, among which Liaobian leads
ahead(CNY2700), and Gaizhou fell on the last (CNY1789).
* Weihai City of Shandong province
Table 3.3.1 lists socia-economic status in Weihai City of Shangdong
province.
* Nantong City
I.  The city covers a land area of 8001 km2 with coast line of 206 km and
owns an area of tidal sand beach of 20 x 104 ha. The population of
city is 7.8525 million, in which a population of 5.7263 million is in
80



country side.  The cultivated area in the city is 4.7 x I15ha, 0.06 ha.
cultivated area per capita.  The income in country side is CNY
3,168.00 per capita, but the fishermen in the&coastal area earn CNY
5,000.00 per capita.  The details are shown in the table of General
Status of Project Area in Nantong City.
II. Fisheries status
In Nantong City a population of 18.6 x 104  is engaged in fisheries,
in which 7.821  x  104 people work on. fishery production.  The
seafood output in 1996 was 53.62 x ]04 MT.  The value of fishery
output was CNY 2879 million, of which the value of mariculture
amounted to CNY 250 million. About 10,000 people are engaged in
mariculture and cultivation mainly in the field of laver cultivation,
shellfish culture and protection, sand worms digging and picking, and
aquaculture of fish, shrimp and crab.  They possess traditional
experience in exploitation and protection of tidal sand beach.

3.3.5   Other  pollution sources
Noise is also a source of polltuion from the processing plant.  It originates
from strikes and frictions in compressors and processing machines.  In order
to reduce the mechanical noise as less as possible, it is quite necessary to
inspect machines regularly and keep them in normal working conditions. The
standard GB3096-82 stipulates that noise < 60 dB day time and < 50 dB at
night.

3.4   Impact Assessment
3.4.1  Impact assessment on water quality
Fish, shellfish, shrimp, etc are essential material in the processing plant.  The
processing technology mainly includes freezing, salting, shelling, packing and
packaging.  Washing and rinsing water constitutes waste water discharged in
process which contains some nutritious components from raw material. Much
crude matters, mud and sands are involved in washing waste water with less
organics, chemical agents, etc.  In rinsing waste water much more organics,
acidic/ basic subtances and chemical agents are dissolved, but less amout of
heavy metallic ions and toxicants involved, so it is less harmful to micro-
organisms.  Industrial waste water from the plant similar to living sewage can
be simply processed to reach the standard of COD, BOD, SS, NH3-N and pH
and then be released, that would not significantly affect the environmental water
quality.
3.4.2  Impact assessment on land
The contents of project include the reconstruction and expansion programmes
of the processing plant, so no factory area is expanded and no land is needed.
Hence, the reconstruction project does not compete with agricultural crop
cultivation for cultivated land and will not make any influence on the present
coast line or biological community.
A certain quantity of shells, fish skins, viscera and other wastes will be left over
for disposal.  If they are disposed arbitrarily, it is sure to influence sanitation in
the vicinity of plant and also view appearance. However, at present the best
way to dispose them is to freeze the wastes and supply them to feedstuff plant
as raw . material for feed making.  It not only solves the problem  of
environmental pollution, but also makes the wastes sufficiently utilized.  The
sewage discharged should be released to the sea through drainage pipe or canals
and ditches.  Do not let it flow to farming land and around the habitant area.
3.5    Management and Monitoring
3.5.1  Proposals and strategem for disposing plans of waste water, sewage and
solid wastes
* Waste water and sewage
Waste water and sewage should be disposed by the purification process and
reach the stipulated indexes in GB8978-88 "Sewage Comprehensive
Release Standard", then be reasonably discharged after inspection by
environmental protection authorities.
Today, sewage and waste water from most of the processing plants in China
are directly discharged into the sea, rivers or vicinal places without
treatment.  In the past it was reluctantly acceptable to dispose sewage in
82



this way, because the amount of sewage and waste water from the
processing plant was not large enough and the concentration of COD was
not high too.
However, in accordance with the data reported by the relevant authorities,
the relatively high concentration of organics are involved in some river
entrances, coastal, and even inner gulfs.   Although these organics
originate from industrial waste water and living sewage, the sewage or
waste water containing organics from other sources should also be
processed accordingly, particularly in waters where organic pollution is
very serious.
Methods and procesing technology of organics polluted water are under
study and exploitation today, but some of them are hard to be realized due
to economic limitation. However, using the sedimentation tank properly
designed is still an economic and efficient way.  Generally, the process of
sedimentation may efficiently remove most of suspended organics.  If the
coagulant is added to tank, organic particulates will be coagulated to form
larger lumps which are easily collected and used as additives to feedstuff.
When pumice stone is used, NH3-N will be partially absorbed.  The
dissolved organics in water can be reduced by means of aeration.
* Solid wastes
Solid wastes include residues left over from processing raw materials
during the process and coal dregs from boiler.  The edible portion of
residues can be supplied aftter dehydration to feedstuff plant for feeds
making or sent directly to pasture as feeds.  As to the unedible portion of
residues, it can be deeply buried in the earth or used as agricultural material
for making bricks, fillings for road pavement or fireproof material. Smoke
and dust in waste gas are removed by the specific duster, then be released
until GB714-32 standard is met.  Oil boiler is suggested to reduce the
pollution source.
3.5.2   Management
The environmental protection in the construction project relates to such
administrative departments as provincial or municipal bureau of aquatic product,
project office and bureau of environmental protection.
* Organization for environmental management and responsibility in
construction project
The provincial or municipal bureau of aquatic product assumes the
responsibilites of drawing up the overall plan for the project, coordinating
the relationship between other departments, and directing the project unit
83



to implement all measures concerning environmental management. The
project office is under the direction of higher Pevel organization and offers
overall services to the project construction.  Meantime, the office takes
responsibility to supervise and inspect all measures regarding the
environmental management.  The municipal bureau of environmental
protection is responsible to supervise how the environmental protection
plan is implemented in the construction unit and to make measures of
environmental protection practicable.
* Environmental protection measures during implementation of project
I.  In the period of project registration, planning and designing prior to
the project construction, there are environmental activities involved in
the project plan, i.e. the feasible report in which a section concerning
environmental protection is stated, an environmental impact
assessment and drawing up an assessment report on environmental
impact.
II. During the project under construction , it is necessary to strengthen
environmental management and supervision in order to assure the
realization of measures for environmental protection.
III. Strictly implement the plan for environmental monitoring and
inspection and measures for environmental protection during the
processing production.  At the same time, strictly manage the
sanitary  conditions in the  processing  area.   The processing
workshops should be enclosed and air-conditioned in summer to
protect from contamiates. To use municipal tap water for washing
and rinsing in the processing production.  All indexes for water
quality should meet the water quality indexes stipulated in national
standard.  In addition, there is a pasteurization room in the workshop
and strict regulations about sanitaion should be set up.  Workers and
utensils used should be properly pasteurized.
IV. All waste water and materials should be disposed according to the
disposal plan.
3.5.3  Monitoring and Testing
* Objectives
The objective of monitoring and testing is to obtain data for environmental
management and supervision.
O Contents of monitoring and testing
I.  The discharged amount of COD in waste water from the processing
production;
II. Toxicant residues in raw material (body of fish, shrimp and shellfish);
III. Sanitary quality of processed aquatic products.
84



3.5.4   Organization, staff and instruments
A department of quality control composed of relevant is technicians organized
in the processing plant.  To assure implementation of inspecting and testing, a
laboratory for chemical test and inspection should be set where necessary
instruments for analysis and inspection shall be augmented.  Technicians are
required to have a professional training for a certain period of time.

4.  Assessment conclusions
From the point of view of natural conditions, the four sub-project sites of this sustainable
development project of Chinese coastal resources are located in the subtropical or
temperate zone with suitable climate, long coastal line, numberous harbours and branching
streams, and flat and wide tidal seabeaches. Moreover, the marine environment in these
areas is not suffered from agricultural and industrial pollutions yet, and they are naturally
favorable to develop coastal fisheries. As these areas are in the location of coastal zones
where economy and trade are well developed, people are highly educated in science and
labour employment is sufficient with good quality, these social and economic conditions
provide opportunities for the development of coastal fisheries.
Traced back to early times, these areas have already been important based for traditional
fishery production. The strong bases for processing fish, shrimp, shellfish, algae, etc. have
been completely set up in these areas. Therefore, the situation of social environment in the
areas will be favourable to the fulfillment and development of this project.
The aims of this project are to realize sustainable development of fishery resources and to
achieve coordination between production four items of this project i.e. management of
coastal zone, multispecies mariculture, reconstruction of prawn pond, and quality and
safety of aquatic products, it is quite necessary to consider how to reduce disadvantageous
effects on ecological environment in the surrounding area.
The measure suggested above may greatly reduce the degree of pollution caused by
aquaculture itself through raising technical level various effective multispecies
comprehensively cultured, etc. So long as the construction and production of processing
plants and wholesale markets of aquatic products strictly follows the relevant standards of
national environmental protection, it is convinced that disadvantageous effects on
surrounding environment will be greatly reduced.
Generally speaking, most of effects produced by the project will be positive. The project
may not only fully utilize coastal natural resources and increase fishery production, but
also lighten fishing pressure, bring along the development of related enterprises and create
a lot of opportunities for obtaining employment. Based on our estimation, when the
project is completed, it may annually increase 331,900 metric ton of fishery product, 2.72
billion Chinese yuan of output value, and realize 22,100 Chinese yuan of tax revenue and
0.508 billion Chinese yuan of profit. Meanwhile, the project may provide 25,000 people in
obtaining employment, among them 80% more people being women. It may also promote
the development of countryside economy and progress of society. Briefly, the project of
sustainable development of Chinese coastal resources will produce great social, economic
and ecological benefits.
