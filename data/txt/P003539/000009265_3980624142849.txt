A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective and key performance indicators (see Annexes 1 and JA):
The project's objectives are to (a) support the Government's commitment to sustainable development of
China's coastal resources, (b) reduce pressure on coastal fishery resources and (c) help improve aquatic
product quality. These objectives will be achieved through (a) the design and implementation of coastal
zone management (CZM) plans in selected areas of four coastal provinces; (b) investments in advanced
hatchery technology and marine aquaculture that promote and reinforce sound CZM policies; (c) a
program of field trials to develop methods to rehabilitate shrimp ponds affected by recent disease
problems; (d) expansion and quality improvement of storage, processing and marketing facilities for
aquatic products; (e) training of public and private sector staff in quality control procedures for aquatic
products consistent with the approach called "Hazard Analysis at Critical Control Points" (HACCP); and
(f) the application of HACCP standards to processing plants and markets upgraded by the project.
Key performance indicators will measure: increases in beneficiary incomes, production and survival
rates of mariculture species; linkage of environmental data to production decisions; replenishment of
natural fish stock; increase in use of fry from hatcheries; dissemination of results of shrimp trials;
increase in feed conversion efficiency ratios; application of carrying capacity research; dissemination of
HACCP training and principles outside the project area; conformance to HACCP guidelines.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
The project advances two aspects of the assistance strategy. First, a central CAS objective is to assist the
Chinese authorities to strengthen institutions and provide tools for improved environmental management
and finance investments that will produce improvements in the short run. The CAS identifies coastal
zone management as one of the critical issues guiding the Chinese environmental agenda. Second, to
support agriculture in China, the CAS calls for assisting the government to develop new and sustainable
approaches to food security.
CAS document number: 16321-CHJA   Date of latest CAS discussion: February, 1997
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
China's densely populated coastal provinces have developed at break neck speed during the last 15 years.
High agricultural production increases combined with double digit industrial growth rates have increased
the pressure on limited natural resources. This rapid development came at a price and policy makers face
the challenge of reconciling ambitious growth targets with long-term sustainability and environmental
protection. Facing increasing population levels (exacerbated by inflows of migrants from the inland
provinces), provincial leaders are under pressure to expand exploitation of their ocean resources during
the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and beyond. The leaders in China's coastal areas perceive that
their future depends on their ability to fully manage and utilize their coastal/ocean resources on a
sustainable basis. The central government is aware of the unsatisfactory status of coastal zone
management as reflected in heavy overfishing near shore, increasing risk of shellfish disease, outbreaks
of red tides, unacceptable pollution levels in some estuaries, and the absence of high-level planning and
coordinating mechanisms along the coastline. Recent measures to address the situation have included the
tightening of fisheries regulations and their enforcement, and a strong commitment at the Agenda 21
meetings to strengthen coastal zone management and to crackdown on polluting industries.



Page 3
The Ninth Five-Year Plan places agriculture at the top of the agenda and Chinese policymakers are
clearly concerned about food production in the 21st century. With agricultural resources approaching
productivity limits, ocean farming is seen as the most important potential growth area.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The project will operationalize the government's strategy to foster coastal zone management in several
large pilot areas by taking existing national policies and testing them at the local level.
The project will support the development of sustainable ocean farming techniques by systematically
improving breeding and production techniques and applying carrying capacity considerations on a large
scale.
The large environmental benefits generated by the project are sufficient justification for public
investment. The project will provide medium term financing of about 50 percent of the capital cost of the
aquaculture components. The owner operators will secure financing, mostly short-term, from banks and
informal sources for the remaining capital costs and for working capital. Alternatives to the medium-
term financing provided by the project are not available in the project areas because the banks and other
lenders find short-term loans are in such demand that they see no reason to face the risks of longer term
loans. A similar situation applies to the processing plants and hatcheries although, in a few cases, joint-
venture partners have been able to bring in medium-term financing for capital improvements in
processing plants. The project will demonstrate the attractiveness of these ventures. Without
enviromnental safeguards, aquaculture investments can carry environmental risks. The project will put in
place environmental practices and systems at the local level that will ensure private investment operates
under environmentally sound criteria.

The component will support the formulation and      physical
implementation of Coastal Zone Management programs
in Fujian, Jiangsu, Shandong and Liaoning. This would
include: (a) establishment of institutional arrangements
to promote CZM; (b) assessment of the present status of
resource use; (c) detailed preparation of coastal zone
management plans including provision of hardware and
software for data management and analysis; (d) equip-
ment and training for environmental data collection and
analysis; (e) establishment of fishery and environmental
management centers; (0) provision of fishery surveil-
lance vessels and equipment for environmental
monitoring and stock assessment; (g) establishment of a
coastal forest protection belt in Nantong (Jiangsu).
Marine Aquaculture                                  physical         136.2           68.1         63.1           46
The component will support environmentally sustaina-
ble marine aquaculture in shallow waters and tidal flats.
It will provide loans for equipment, materials, facilities
and services to farmers for aquaculture. This will
include raising fin fish in net cages, and breeding
oysters, scallops, kelp, algae, clams and laver. A main
focus will be to support new artificial breeding tech-
niques in order to reduce pressure on the natural sources
of seed and fingerlings.

In recent years, the productivity of shrimp culture in the
project areas has been severely reduced by virus out-
breaks. The project supports trials involving new
methods of shrimp culture. The aim is to devise
methods of pond management that could be sustainable
and profitable on a large scale. The component will
involve phasing during implementation until it is clear
that the disease problems have been overcome and the
results are sustainable.

This component will provide loans to a number of  institution bldg.
seafood handling operations, including processing and
wholesale markets, to improve aquatic product quality
and safety. Investments will lead to improvements in
aquatic product handling at all steps in production, mar-
keting and processing. Items to be supported under the
project include: expansion and improvement of selected
cold storage, packaging facilities, and wholesale mar-
kets for aquatic products, construction and expansion of
improved processing facilities; and training in HACCP
concepts. This will enable the companies to meet higher
standards of quality and safety demanded by China's
main customers in North America and Europe. All facil-
ities supported by the project will be required to apply
standards based on HACCP system.

2. Description of Project Areas
The Project Areas.' The four areas selected represent a broad range of climatic, ecological and
economic zones, that can be considered representative of China's 18,000 km long coastline.
Fujian Province. Tlhe coastline of Fujian Province has numerous bays, inlets and islands. The distance
between the points where the borders of Fujian intersect the ocean is about 500 km, but the actual length
of coastline is over 2,500 km. Thus, Fujian's geography provides numerous potential sites for the
farming of aquatic products. Over 60 percent of the tidal flats suitable for aquaculture have already been
developed and no further expansion of these areas is planned, but there are still many sheltered areas of
shallow waters suitable for development. The province plans to locate project components in a number of
prefectures and municipalities. Promising possibilities exist for expanding the cage culture of a wide
range of fish species, and the culture of oysters and scallops.
Nantong Municipality, Jiangsu Province. Nantong Municipality is in the southern part of Jiangsu
Province. The area is bounded to the south by the Yangtze River and in the north by the sea. Its coastline
is much more regular than Fujian. A distinctive feature is the 100,000 ha of tidal flats on the seaward
side which have been formed by the littoral drift of the sediment produced by the Yangtze. These tidal
flats extend 6-10 km from the high tide line and are growing at about 25 meters a year. Over the years,
large areas of tidal flats have been reclaimed to form thriving communities and highly productive
farmland and fish ponds. The tidal flats are exploited for a number of aquatic products both in their
natural state and in the reclaimed areas.
Weihai Municipality, Shandong Province. The project areas are located in the counties of Rushan and
Rongcheng on the coast to the northeast of Qingdao. The main types of coastal topography in these areas
are tidal flats, long sandy beaches, inlets and bays. The water is shallow for a considerable distance from
the shoreline and this has led in recent years to growth of shallow-water culture of fish, shellfish, and
seaweed. Shandong is China's leading producer of aquatic products.
Yingkou Municipality, Liaoning Province. Yingkou Municipality lies in the Liaodong Gulf of the
Bohai Sea. It covers four districts and two counties with an area of 5,400 km 2. The municipality has a
coastline of 96 km, a shallow sea area (less than 10 m) of 130,000 ha and tidal flats of 10,500 ha. The
tidal flats have been developed for clam cultivation and, over the years, pond culture of shrimps and fish
has developed in areas reclaimed many years ago for salt production. Agricultural land in the
municipality is largely devoted to irrigated rice cultivation, and farmers in the area are skilled in
culturing river crabs in their rice fields. This raises farm incomes and reduces the need for
agrochemicals.
For project implenentation and disbursement purposes, Xiamen, a Special Economic Zone, is treated as a separate project
area in the loan agreement. In the PAD, references to Fujian include Xiamen.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The project will support key environmental policy reforms by: (a) establishing coastal zone management
systems; (b) aiding the enforcement of new and existing regulations to prevent environment damage and
(c) promoting technologies and methods to make use of coastal resources in a sustainable manner.
3. Benefits and target population:
The project will directly benefit the local communities along the coastline of four provinces in China by
increasing incomes and ensuring long-term sustainable use of local resources.
It will provide employment opportunities for approximately 85,000 people, of whom around one-third
are expected to be women. In addition to income benefits, the knowledge gained about sustainable
technologies and methods will have a significant impact on the mariculture industry outside the project
area.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
The project will be implemented over a period of six years. A mid-term review is planned for 2001.
Institutional Structure Overall direction of the project at the central government level rests with the
Ministry of Agriculture. MOA will closely coordinate with the State Oceanic Administration. In each of
the project areas, high-level Steering Committees to guide and coordinate coastal zone management have
been established. These committees have representatives from all relevant government departments, the
public and business leaders, and are headed by a senior government official; for example in the case of
Fujian the Vice Governor heads the Steering Committee. In each province there are Fishery Departments
at the provincial, municipal, prefecture and county levels. These departments are staffed by personnel
with wide experience in fishery and aquaculture technology, the provision of support services, and the
review and approval of plans for aquaculture/agriculture development. The Fishery Departments in line
with recent government policy are becoming more involved in environmental monitoring and coastal
zone management. A Central Project Management Office (CPMO) has been set up in each project area:
in Fujian at the provincial level and in Nantong, Weihai, Yingkou and Xiamen at the municipality levels.



Page 9
In all project areas, PMOs have been set up in the counties. These PMOs have been closely involved in
the planning and design of the project, in consultation with the potential beneficiaries at the township and
village levels. Aquaculture components will be owned and operated by individuals, small groups of
farmers, and township and village enterprises. The PMOs have the primary responsibility for planning
the production components of the project, and have a leading role in the formulation and implementation
of coastal zone management plans.
Financial Arrangements The proceeds of the Bank loan will be made available to the five project
agencies for 20 years including 5 years grace at the LIBOR-based rate. Project beneficiaries will be
granted subloans for project components for up to 15 years including up to 5 years' grace, at a rate not
less than the LIBOR-based rate. The foreign exchange risk will be born by the beneficiaries. Each project
agency will keep separate accounts that will be audited by independent national level auditors annually.
The mission reviewed financial arrangements and controls and found them to be adequate. Supervision
missions will monitor financial arrangements annually.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
The original project proposal consisted of three main components. About 50 percent of the investment
was to go into the construction and rehabilitation of shrimp ponds, 30 percent was allocated for
expanding eel production and the remainder was to be invested in new aquatic products processing
facilities. The preparation team concluded that shrimp pond rehabilitation on a large scale would be too
risky given the uncertainty of new techniques. Similarly, eel farming is still dependent entirely on the
catch of natural fry (elvers) in the East China Sea. The declining supply of elvers suggests that this
production system is not sustainable. Therefore, although highly profitable in years with abundant elver
supply, eel farms have been excluded from the project. Investment in new aquatic product processing
plants was found to have lower priority than upgrading hygienic standards and quality at existing plants.
Proposals to build new fish ponds in areas of valuable wild life habitat were dropped with the full
support of local leaders.
During identification, the objective of the project was shifted from a single focus on production to one
centered on sustainability and product quality. The coastal zone management approach could also have
justified investments not directly related to ocean resources, such as sewage treatment plants or tourism
facilities. But, these were ruled out in order to maintain the focus of the project, reduce complexity, and
also because the team felt that investments in aquaculture would provide the best possible leverage to
achieve higher standards of water quality and environmental management in the coastal areas. The role
of the Fisheries Department in enforcing water quality regulations has been strengthened considerably in
recent years.
A stand-alone project to provide software and hardware for CZM would be too small an operation to be
of interest to the Government or the Bank. Furthermore, the jurisdictions responsible for repayment of
the Bank Loan require that the project include financially viable production components. Therefore, the
factors considered in the selection of production components were:
* compatibility with sound coastal management practices;
* proven technical and financial viability;
* environmental sustainability;
*  opportunities for participation of individual households as owner-operators;



Page 1 0
*  improvements in cultural practices, for example reduction in waste products through improved feed
conversion ratios and/or polyculture systems;
*  reduced pressure on natural sources of brood stock through expansion of hatcheries and management
of natural sources;
*  contribution to seafood quality control;
2. Major related projects financed by the Bank and/or other development agencies (completed, ongoing
andplanned):

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Coastal Zone Management is a relatively new field for Bank involvement. To date, no completed Bank-
financed projects are available for reference. Worldwide, more than 100 CZM  programs are currently
under implementation (without Bank involvement), mostly focusing on land-based sources of marine
pollution, coastal management, sea-level rise issues, and conservation of living marine resources.
Experience to date indicates that CZM programs generally are most effective when:
*  there is a strong commitment at the highest levels of government to change behavior;
*  high visibility improvements can be obtained at an early stage in the program;
*  the policies to be followed are clear and unambiguous;
*  the goals are clearly articulated;
*  adequate resources are available for implementation;
*  there js public awareness and support;
*  adequate resources are given to monitoring, evaluation and enforcement activities;
In the course of preparation, it became apparent that the political climate and state of development in
China's coastal provinces provides a unique opportunity for a Bank supported project-or, ideally, a
series of Bank supported projects-to contribute to significant advances in sustainable development of
the coastal areas. The project design is also a direct result of lessons learned in the first Bank Group
supported coastal development project in China. There, the focus was on increasing production. It began
before the worldwide outbreak of shrimp disease (starting in 1988 and reaching mainland China in 1991)
and brought to the attention of the industry the serious drawbacks of intensive shrimp aquaculture (still
only partially understood).

4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The mission found that there was strong support from the top leadership at various levels for the project
design. There have been major economic losses in the past in most project areas as a result of
unsustainable practices. For example, exceeding carrying capacity led to losses in laver and scallop
production. Also, outbreaks of shrimp disease have been largely attributed to excessive and unmanaged
pressure on the natural resource. There is strong evidence of overfishing in the near coast areas. The
willingness of provincial planning commissions and finance bureaus to borrow IBRD funds for
environmental monitoring is the strongest indication that CZM is seen as a high priority. Interest of local
communities in participating in the project is strongly reflected in applications for subloans far exceeding
the current loan amount.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The involvement of the Bank has already provoked considerable discussion at the local level and
between the provinces and participating communities regarding the formulation and implementation of
CZM plans. This has not only raised the awareness of the importance of CZM, but has already yielded
substantial commitment to action. Continued involvement of the Bank will expedite this process, ensure
the introduction of the most advanced planning techniques, and contribute tangibly to the long-term
sustainable use of coastal resources. Bank involvement will help to make the HACCP concept
operational by bringing together international experts and the local agencies responsible for formulating
the guidelines and tfe aquatic production, processing and marketing enterprises. Finally, Bank
involvement helps raticinalize and optimize aquaculture production by introducing alternative models and
more sustainable production practices.
E: Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (see Annex 4):
[4 ] Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV = 359 million; ERR = 23 percent:
The benefits of the Coastal Zone Management component would arise from the avoidance of losses due
to unsustainable resource use and pollution. For example, in recent years, laver production in some areas
of Jiangsu exceeded carrying capacity and this led to diseases that caused a sharp drop in production.
Another example was the "red tide" in the Yantai area in 1995 that was attributed to sewage and
agricultural effluents. The losses due to such incidents far exceed the cost of facilities and services
needed to avoid them through CZM and regular monitoring. The economic benefits of the Sustainable
Marine Aquaculture component can be readily quantified; the economic rate of return (ERR) for the
investments in production systems ranges from 15 to 30 percent, including provisions for large losses.
The aim of the Shrimp Pond Rehabilitation component is to devise production methods for existing
ponds that are sustainable, economically attractive and environmentally acceptable. These ponds have
alternative aquaculture uses and hence incremental returns will have to be sufficient to justify the costs
of rehabilitation. The economic benefits of the Product Quality and Safety component arise from
enhancing the safety of products and making them more marketable (see Annex 4 for economic
analyses).
2. Financial (see Annex 4): NPV = 212 million; IRR = 25 percent
The production components of the project have high financial rates of return ranging from 13 to 30
percent, even including provisions for large losses.



Page 12
Fiscal impact: The marine aquaculture components are expected to generate approximately Y 400
million in additional tax revenue.
3. Technical:
The project will draw on the considerable technical skills of officials and beneficiaries in the project
areas but, at the same time, it will contribute to an enhancement of techniques for coastal zone
management, production, product safety and product quality. Some of the more important areas to be
covered are:
* Coastal Zone Management
*  application of GIS techniques to resource surveys and identification of potentials and
constraints;
*  application of modeling techniques to studies of carrying capacity;
*  development of techniques for formulation of CZM plans;
*  design of environmental and disease monitoring programs.
* Production Technology
-  advances in hatchery technology, especially for those species presently harvested from
natural sources;
-  trials of improvements in feed efficiency for cage culture in order to reduce pollution and
improve returns;
*  the use of abandoned shrimp ponds for raising scrap fish as a feed for cage culture;
*  locating cages and bivalve culture sites to promote natural uptake of nutrients in cage
effluents by bivalves;
*  technical support for enterprises engaged in production of high-value species such as yellow
croaker, sea bream, puffer, etc.
* Shrimp Pond Rehabilitation
*  application of techniques and equipment for biological and physical inventories of shrimp
ponds;
-  identify ponds where rehabilitation is most likely to succeed and eliminate those with low
prospects for success;
*  trials of a range of production systems involving new methods of disease control;
* tests of alternatives to chlorine as pond disinfectants.
* Product Quality and Safety
* introduction of HACCP concepts to processing and marketing facilities financed by the
project;
* training of producers and government officials in HACCP procedures.
4. Institutional:
All of the central, provincial and local government agencies involved have considerable experience in
the planning, design and execution of fishery projects. Similarly, the beneficiaries will be selected from
households with experience in aquaculture. A new institutional feature introduced by the project will be
the Steering Committee set up in each project area to guide and coordinate coastal zone management.
These committees to be headed by senior government officials are expected to promote a high level of
cooperation and coordination between the various public and private entities engaged in coastal resource
use.

5. Social:
The project will have a positive social impact because most of the beneficiaries will be low-income
families living in coastal/rural areas. The production components will generate employment in harvesting
and processing and wil'l help to ensure sustainable livelihoods as an alternative to the declining fishing
sector. No resettlement of people or relocation of housing is expected to be necessary since identified
new facilities, or expansion of existing facilities, will take place on unoccupied land already owned by
the enterprises. Should any resettlement occur at a later stage, a resettlement action plan will be prepared
and all relocation, compensation, and livelihood establishment will be handled on the basis of policies,
planning principles, institutional arrangements and design criteria which have been reviewed by the Bank
and found to be acceptable. The resettlement plan will be subject to Bank approval. Social impact
assessment is an integral part of the coastal zone management planning process.
6. Environmental assessment:
Environmental Category     [] A   [i/ ]B  []C
The primary aim of the project is to enhance the environment in coastal areas by:
*  the design and implementation of integrated coastal zone management plans;
*  the siting and selection of production components to avoid overload of carrying capacity;
* the conservation of endemic species through protected area management;
* hatchery development to take the pressure off natural sources of stock; and
* the provision of facilities for environmental monitoring.
The production component involves no new ponds and hence the adverse impacts sometimes associated
with pond construction will be avoided. Water quality problems can be caused by cage culture effluents,
but the proposed cages will be widely scattered, in many cases combined with scallops, oysters, sea
cucumbers and seaweed culture, and sited where there is ample dispersion and mixing by winds and
tides. The practice is also to move cages about every three years to new locations and to clean up the
abandoned sites. Cages also use scrap fish as feed, and this can put pressure on populations of certain
species of fish. Therefore, the possibility of commercial production of lower-value fish in ponds and use
of processed feeds will be explored by the project. Chlorine is sometimes used as a disinfectant in shrimp
ponds; alternatives to chlorine will be explored as part of the shrimp rehabilitation component. Each
proposed seafood processing plant will undergo an environmental assessment including specific
mitigation and monitoring plans for effluent treatment. A full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
has been prepared by the East China Seas Fishery Research Institute, (ECSFRI) following detailed terms
of reference approved by the Bank. This report has been approved by the National Environmental
Protection Agency (NEPA).
7. Participatory approach
Officials of the provincial, municipal and county bureaus have met with potential beneficiaries
throughout the proposed project areas and have found strong support for the project. In fact, the number
of households wishing to participate far exceeds the number that can be accommodated.
Consultation with stak;eholders during the early stages of preparation led to a number of changes in the
project concept. The scope of the Coastal Zone Management component increased when both the
government and the B3ank became aware of the strong need felt by local residents, enterprises and
governments for more effective planning mechanisms. Implementation of CZM is a participatory
process, with planning decisions based on inputs from all stakeholders. Consultation with prospective



Page 14
aquaculture farmers resulted in changes in site and species selection. The shrimp pond rehabilitation
component was reduced and refocused on scientific trials when consultation with shrimp farmers and
researchers convinced the teamn that a pure production component would be too risky.
F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
The production components consist for the most part of activities that are well understood and
established in the project areas and hence the question of sustaining a new and unfamiliar mode of
development does not arise. A major project objective is to promote environmental sustainability through
CZM planning and in, particular through surveys to ensure that exploitation of the coastal resource is
within carrying capacity. A detailed monitoring system will track progress in coastal management,
physical implementation and a range of environmental and socioeconomic data.
2. Critical Risks (reflecting assumptions in the fourth column of Annex 1):

quality, storm protection, strengthening of
disease monitoring and control, and
stronger links between researchers,
extension workers, and farmers.
Overall Risk Rating                                moderate
Marine aquaculture operations confront both natural and man-made hazards. Typhoons can damage the
basic facilities such as net cages, and the various kinds of platforms used to raise oysters, scallops and
laver. Disease is in part a natural hazard, but it often arises from high-intensity culture. The " red tide", a
toxic algae that kills bivalves, is caused by high nutrient levels produced by sewage and fertilizer runoff.
A variety of production components will be widely scattered within each of the project areas that are also
widely spaced from Liaoning in the north to Fujian in the south. Thus, the diversity in type and location
of the production components ensures that damage and interruption of production will be infrequent and
geographically limited.
3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Aquaculture projects can be controversial. One of the main objections is that they infringe on wetlands
and other ecologically important areas such as mangroves. The project involves no new ponds and hence
this issue does not arise. Objections sometimes arise to net cage culture; these and possible remedies are
discussed in Annex 2 and addressed in the EIA.

ANNEX 2: PROJECT DESCRIPTION'
COMPONENT 1: COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT (US$16 MILLION)
Summary
This component will support the formulation and implementation of Coastal Zone Management (CZM)
programs in Fujian, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Liaoning Provinces through (a) preparation of CZM plans in
several municipalities and (b) improvement of the facilities for data collection, monitoring, and
management. In addition to the features summarized below, consulting services will be provided to assist
in the preparation of CZM plans. Also, hatcheries described under the marine aquaculture component,
will have an important role in coastal resource management by reversing the depletion of natural
breeding stocks.

Background
The coastal provinces, with their remarkable growth in manufacturing, agriculture and fisheries, have
been in the forefront of China's economic development. As an example of the gains in the fishery sector,
Fujian's annual output of aquatic products is now over 2.5 million tons compared with around 50,000
For disbursement purposes, Xiamen, a Special Economic Zone, is treated as a separate project area in the loan agreement.
In the PAD, references to Fujian include Xiamen.

tons in 1980. Similar growth rates are on record for the other provinces involved in this project. In these
four provinces, and indeed in all of China's coastal provinces, there is potential for further gains in
production, for more diverse output and, through improved processing, for higher value-added. Much of
this potential, however, has to be realized by developing the intertidal and subtidal zones for marine
aquaculture and to a lesser extent, inland water bodies suited to freshwater aquaculture. In the future,
ocean fishing is unlikely to become more productive without improved management. In fact, the most
likely outcome is a downward trend with a shift from high-value to low-value species.
In the coastal zones of the project, large areas have been developed for marine aquaculture. In recent
years, there have been outstanding advances in aquaculture technology and production has generally
been located away from pollution sources. But, government officials and leaders in the provinces
recognize that their ambitious plans for the future-doubling output in the next five years-call for a
more systematic approach to coastal zone management (CZM), backed up by improved facilities for
monitoring and management. They are aware that a strategy that simply raises production will not lead to
sustainable development. The project comes at the right time to support a strong commitment to
sustainable coastal development shared by provincial leaders, the planning commissions in the provinces
and municipalities, and the fishery departments. In each project area, steps have been taken, or are being
taken, to set up steering committees for CZM headed by senior officials and composed of all relevant
organizations.
Approach
The key policy component of this project is, therefore, to help the authorities in the project areas to
achieve sustainable resource development through the application of coastal zone management
techniques. It will do this primarily by providing the tools and facilities for CZM. While it is not the
purpose of the project to finance specific infrastructure elements of a coastal zone plan, such as sewage
treatment and pollution abatement, the project will prioritize key investment and will help with the
establishment of financing arrangements downstrearn. Aside from its support for CZM, the project will
contribute to rational and sustainable development of marine aquaculture through the design and
application of selection criteria for production sites. And it will also contribute to biodiversity through
the hatchery component (reduced pressure on wild stocks) and the protection of endangered species in
Xiamen.
The authorities in the project areas are being assisted in the formulation of CZM plans by a team of
consultants financed by CIDA Inc. of Canada. The team composed of specialists in many of the
disciplines required for CZM planning visited China in August and November 1997, and further visits
are planned for early 1998. The August visit produced a high degree of technical cooperation between
the team and the various entities engaged in CZM. This led to agreement on the main CZM issues in the
project areas and a definition of matters for priority attention. The team also introduced some recent
advances in the application of Geographic Information Systems satellite imagery. The end product of the
team's work will be a joint effort with Chinese experts to produce preliminary CZM plans for selected
areas. These will clearly set out physical conditions as they pertain to CZM and define the main elements
of a CZM plan. They will be in sufficient detail to verify (or if necessary to amend ) the sites selected for
the project's marine aquaculture activities. The physical setting of the project areas, the CZM
institutions, an overview of CZM issues, and the CZM components are summarized below.

CZM in Fujian
Physical Setting. The coastline of Fujian Province has numerous bays, inlets and islands. The distance
between the points where the borders of Fujian intersect the ocean is about 500 km, but the actual length
of coastline is over 2,5100 km. Thus, Fujian's geography provides numerous sites for the farming of
aquatic products. Over 60 percent of the tidal flats suitable for reclamation have already been developed
and no further reclamation is planned, but there are still many sheltered areas of shallow waters suitable
for development. The province plans to locate project components in a number of prefectures. Promising
possibilities exist for expanding the cage culture of a wide range of fish species, and the culture of
oysters and scallops.
Putian and Xiamen municipalities have been selected as areas of concentration for CZM planning in
Fujian. Xiamen has alreaLdy made progress in setting up institutional arrangements for CZM and physical
planning is ahead of Putian. The problems of Putian are however more immediate and challenging.
Challenge. Putian's coastline includes extensive coastal bays and islands. The vast shallow sea area
(50,000 ha with depth less than 10 m) holds great potential for aquaculture, including the culture of
clams and oysters. The Putian area stands out for its diversity in both aquatic products and physical
shoreline characteristics. This natural wealth exists in an area of international importance for tourism and
national importance for trade, industry (a steel mill and an oil refinery), and transportation (shipping
lanes, harbors, ports, railway and road). CZM, at an early stage in such a situation, presents an
opportunity to optimize several objectives while ensuring the long term sustainability of the resource
base.
Institutions. At the provincial level, a Coastal Zone Leading Committee, chaired by a vice-governor, has
been established to coordinate the work of all organizations in the management of coastal resources.
Municipal CZM Committees are in place in Xiamen, Putian and Fuzhou and these report to the Leading
Committee. The Provincial Fishery Bureau of Fujian also reports to the Provincial Leading Committee
and oversees the municipal and county fishery bureaus, the Division of Fishery Management and the
Fujian Fishery Research Institute. The responsibilities of a municipal CZM committee are to (a) design a
CZM plan and coordinate its implementation (b) coordinate and supervise all agencies working in the
coastal zone and (c) draft and monitor compliance with CZM regulations.
CZM Components. A Fishery and Environment Monitoring Center will be built in Fuzhou City close to
the offices of the Fishery Bureau. The Center will be supervised by the Division of Fishery Management
and will house offices, laboratories, training rooms, and dormitories. Scientific and office equipment will
be financed by the project. The Center will be staffed by experts responsible for fishery and environment
monitoring and for training of personnel of municipal centers. The responsibilities of the center will be to
observe and record the physical conditions of coastal waters, including the incidence of pollution, the
status of culture and capture fisheries. The annual training program includes (a) six courses ( 90
participants in each course) in fishery management and monitoring for county and township officials and
extension workers and (lb) eight courses (50 participants) in fishery laws, environmental protection, and
fishery ecology for fisherfolk. Three regional Fishery and Environment Monitoring Stations will be set
up in the coastal areas in the counties of Minnan, Minzhong, and Mindong. These stations will be staffed
and equipped to collect amd analyze data, provide technical guidance to fishers, and act as a link between
the Center and the local governments and fishing communities. The facilities at the stations will be
similar to the Center but on a smaller scale.
A Disease Monitoring and Control Center, to be set up and equipped in Xiamen, will be supervised by
the Fujian Fishery Research Institute. The Center, together with five Disease Monitoring and Control



Page 22                                     ANNEx 3
Stations to be set up in five municipalities (Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Putian, Zhangzhou, and Ningde), will
greatly enhance Fujian's capacity to tackle the aquatic disease problem that every year causes financial
hardship within the culture fishing community. The main functions of the Center and the stations will be
to (a) observe and record the incidence and severity of aquatic diseases, (b) develop techniques to
prevent and treat diseases, and (c) to advise and train extension workers and fishermen in disease
prevention and treatment.
The project will expand Fujian's fleet of fishery surveillance vessels. Of the 12 existing boats, five are to
be retired and five new boats procured under the project. The new boats will range in size from 125 tons
to 190 tons and will be powered by diesel engines ranging from 465 kW to 1,300 kW. The boats will be
used to (a) monitor compliance with fishery laws and regulations, (b) supervise fish catch and fishing
gear, (c) enforce environmental regulations, and (d) provide a platform for stock assessments. The
project will also support a scheme to provide a sanctuary in the waters offshore Xiamen for the White
Dolphin and the Japanese Lancelet.
CZM in Nantong
Physical Setting. The project area is in Nantong Municipality in the southern part of 3iangsu Province.
The area is bounded to the south by the Yangtze river and in the north by the sea. Its coastline is much
more regular than Fujian. A distinctive feature is the 100,000 ha of tidal flats on the seaward side which
have been formed by the littoral drift of the sediment produced by the Yangtze. These tidal flats extend
6-10 km from the high tide line and are growing at about 25 meters a year. Over the years, large areas of
tidal flats have been reclaimed to form thriving communities and highly productive farmland and fish
ponds. The tidal flats are exploited for a number of aquatic products both in their natural state and in the
reclaimed areas.
Challenge. Nantong produces more fisheries' products (532,000 tons/year) than any other municipality
in Jiangsu. Development plans for infrastructure include thermal power plant expansion and seaport
construction, but they are unlikely to conflict with aquaculture on the tidal flats. The major source of
pollution in Nantong is municipal sewage discharged into the network of canals, waterways and rivers
that crisscross the Nantong peninsula. After heavy rain the canals empty into the sea at low tide.
Considerable mixing and dispersion will take place at each tide cycle. However, the effect of periodic
outflows from the canals has to be determined. This is the main CZM issue in Nantong.
Institutions. Coordination of coastal and marine development in Nantong is by a multiagency Municipal
Planning Commission, and under two leading groups, the Nantong Marine Development Leading Group
and the Tidal Flat Development Leading Group. The Nantong Municipal Fisheries Bureau plays a major
role in the development of aquaculture, especially in the extensive tidal flats that are being reclaimed. A
Steering Committee for Coastal Zone Management will be set up in the near future to coordinate CZM
planning and implementation.
CZM Components. The existing Fishery and Environment Monitoring Center will be upgraded by
expanding the building and installing new scientific equipment. This will enhance the capability for
fishery management and environmental monitoring. The station will also provide training courses in
subjects related to CZM for county and township officials engaged in fishery management. The project
includes 200 km of shelter belts in areas where the tidal flats have been reclaimed. The belts with a width
of about 10m will cover a forest area of 1,300 ha. The trees will protect large areas of agricultural land
from wind and salt spray. This will raise yields and allow more diversity in cropping.

CZM in Weihai
Physical Setting. Weihai Municipality is in Shandong Province. The project areas are mainly located in
the counties of Rushtn and Rongcheng on the coast to the north east of Qingdao. The main types of
coastal topography in these areas are tidal flats, mostly already reclaimed, long sandy beaches, and inlets
and bays. The water is shallow for a considerable distance from the shore line and this has led in recent
years to growth in shallow water culture of fish, shell fish, and seaweed. Shandong is China's leading
producer of aquatic products, and the annual value of fishing and aquaculture activities is over US$1
billion.
Challenge. Weihai has 986 km of coastline under its jurisdiction including 104 islands. Of the 30,000 ha
of existing tidal flats and shallow water, 3,600 ha are considered to be high quality and suitable for the
production of seaweed, sea cucumber and abalone. Water pollution in Weihai appears to be light. In
Weihai, three wastewater treatment plants are in operation or are under construction. Rongcheng uses an
innovative wastewater treatment process of initial settling combined with secondary treatment in a large
natural wetland that is immediately adjacent to the sea. The effluent quality being achieved is better than
secondary treatment. Industries are required to treat wastewater to state standards. The main objectives
of CZM are (a) to manzage expansion of aquaculture so that carrying capacity is not exceeded and (b) to
avoid conflicts between tourism, nature conservation and aquaculture.
Institutions. The Weihai municipal government has set up an interagency Coastal Zone Management
Steering Committee chaired by the Mayor, along with a Coastal Zone Management Center within the
Oceanic and Fisheries Bureau. The Steering Committee will make decisions and policy, and the Center
will engage in a range of support activities.
CZM Components. The project will finance construction of a new building and the procurement of
equipment for the Coastal Zone Management Center. The project will also introduce a fishing boat
surveillance system baised on GPS technology in order to (a) protect coastal fishing resources (b) enforce
fisheries laws and regulation and (c) provide a quick-response capability in the case of accident at sea.
The system will consist of a control center located at a central station in Weihai City and 650 mobile
GPS units placed in the larger fishing vessels (over 180 HP).
CZM in Yingkou
Physical Setting. Yingkou Municipality, in Liaoning Province has 96 km of shoreline, with a diverse
marine and land interface, that has been developed fop a variety of uses. Yingkou has 130,000 ha of
shallow water resources (< 10 m deep) of which 53,000 ha can be used for aquaculture especially in the
northern portions of the municipality, where there is a long history of shrimp and fish ponds and salt
farms. Power plants and port facilities are located further south along the coastline. In the more southern
reaches of Yingkou important recreational, historical and cultural resources are found alongside fishing
harbors, and aquaculture. The potential for conflicts and resource issues in this area is high.
Challenge. The Liao River entering the coastal waters in the Yingkou study area is heavily polluted. It
receives effluents from Yingkou and five other cities, including Shenyang, the provincial capital.
Application of CZM principles and practices in this area will help to ensure that pollution from the Liao
He does not cause nelgative impacts on aquaculture and recreational resources located in the southern
parts of the municipality. The coastal area selected for a more detailed CZM will integrate tourism,
recreation, cultural heritage protection and aquaculture.



Page 24                                      ANNEX 3
Institutions. A Leading Group for Coastal Zone Development, headed by the Mayor and with
representatives from all the main sector agencies is the highest level authority on CZM matters in
Yingkou. A CZM Office to support the Leading Group will (a) prepare CZM plans and oversee their
implementation, (b) coordinate agencies involved in the coastal areas, and (c) draft a long term plan for
coastal development. The Office will be housed in a Coastal Zone Management Center, to be set up in
cooperation with the Municipal Ocean & Fisheries Bureau.
CZM Components. The project will finance the building of the Coastal Zone Management Center and
its equipment, and will provide training in CZM.
COMPONENT 2: SUSTAINABLE MARINE AQUACULTURE (US$136 MILLION)
Summary
The project component will support environmentally sustainable marine aquaculture in shallow waters
and tidal flats. This will include raising fin fish in net cages, and breeding oysters, scallops, kelp, algae,
clams and laver. A main focus will be to support new artificial breeding techniques in order to reduce
pressure on the natural sources of seed and fingerling. The tidal flats and shallow coastal waters that are
not protected as natural fish spawning grounds are highly productive and renewable resources. They
offer not only an additional source of income for the local people, but more importantly a significant
potential for food production in a country where land-based resources for food production are already
intensively exploited. The water area suited to this form of development is large enough to make this a
significant future source of high-value food. The main features of the aquaculture component in the four
project areas are summarized in Table A.

Hatcheries
The project will support the development of 26 hatcheries in the four project areas for the propagation of
17 species as shown in Table B. The large yellow croaker, sea bream, sea bass, flounder and turbot are
popular sea fish whose stocks have been reduced by over fishing. The project will apply proven hatchery
technology to raise production of fish fry and reduce pressure on the wild fingerlings which are being
used to supply the net cages. The hatcheries will ensure an adequate supply for the net cages in the
project and also for release of flounder to replenish wild stocks. The oyster, clam and river crab
hatcheries will supply the necessary seed and larvae for expansion of production areas that are part of the



Page 25                                      ANNEX 3
project. Abalone and puffer are high-value products with specialized markets. The abalone output of the
hatcheries will be used for commercial production and natural stock replenishment. The puffer hatcheries
will supply fry to the project areas.

Net Cages
Net cages are planned for two of the project areas: Fujian (175 units) and Weihai (19 units). Climate and
coastal topography in Fujian are conducive to net cage culture and operators have considerable
experience. The fishery departments in Fujian and Weihai apply strict site selection criteria to avoid
pollution, achieve viable production levels, and ensure a safe product. These criteria are as follows:
(a)    sheltered from typhoons;
(b)    depth of water at low tide to be twice the depth of the cage;
(c)    good circulation of water;
(d)    dissolved oxygen content above 5 mg/l;



Page 26                                       ANNEX3
(e)    areas free from pollution;
(f)    not too much fresh water;
(g)    no interference with navigation;
(h)    complies with national water quality standards for aquaculture.
(i)    density not to exceed 10 percent of the area;
(j)    cages to be moved every three years and the vacated site treated with lime; and
(k)    where possible cages to be combined with algae and bivalves.
In Fujian, large yellow croaker, porgy, and sea bass will be farmed, and in Weihai flounder and
turbot will be cultivated. The net cages in Fujian generally have a minimum size of 3x3x4 meters,
and in Weihai where the sites have deeper water they will be mostly 5x5x5 meters. They are
constructed with timber and metal frames supported on styrofoam floats. The mesh size of the
netting material varies in size according to the growth stage of the fish. In general, there are three
stages in fish growth that require netting material with different opening sizes: 1) the fry to fingerling
(8 to 10 cm) stage with 0.5 cm openings; 2) the fingerling to juvenile (150 grams) stage with 1.5 cm
to 2.5 cm openings; and 3) the juvenile to adult stage (400 grams to 1 kg) with 4.5 cm openings.
The frames and floats last for 6 to 8 years. The rope and netting material used to secure the net to the
timber and anchor the net cages, however, must be replaced every three years. A typical production
unit will consist of 200 cages. The production time for most species is about 18 months.
The fish are mostly fed low-value fish such as sardines, anchovies or sprat caught in areas close to
the nets. In the fry and fingerling stages, they are also fed a floating feed which consists of white fish
meal, starch, and other minor ingredients. In order to improve the feed-conversion ratio, the project
will sponsor research production into floating feed for the net cages. Not all of the production units
will raise the fish from fry to market size. Some fish will be purchased as fingerlings or at the
juvenile stage at a higher price in order to shorten the production time. The bay areas where the net
cages are places require good tidal movement to remove waste and feed debris. The project will
support studies to determine the carrying capacity of the water area and promote the culture of cages
in conjunction with filter feeders, such as scallops and kelp, to help maintain good water quality.
Oysters
In Fujian suspended oysters will be cultivated on 4,446 ha. In suspended culture, the spats are set in the
hatchery on shells on nylon ropes at a density of 100-110 for each meter of vertical rope. The growing
ropes are 1.0 meter in length. These nylon growing ropes are then taken and suspended from lines
supported by floats and anchored to the ocean bottom. There are 300 frames per ha and 20 ropes per
frame for a total of 6,000 per hectare. The frames are placed in water depths from 3 to 5 meters.
Production averages 75 tons (with shell) per ha. No feed is necessary for the oysters since they grow by
filtering phytoplankton in the water column. The growing time is 1.5 to 2 years. After harvest, oysters
are sold live or shucked, and the meat is sold in the domestic markets. In Weihai, suspended oysters will
be cultivated on 100 ha, and there will be 100 ha of oysters raised on the mud flats. The mud flat
cultivation consists of improving an area of long established low-yielding oyster beds. The beds will be
raised, seeded with improved oyster varieties, and harvested in a controlled manner.
Scallops
Two species of scallops will be grown: The imported American Bay Scallop does well in both the north
and south of China. Shandong also has had success with the native scallop. Scallops are grown using
rafts or chains. Each chain has 80-200 circular "lanterns" nets, shaped as their name implies. Each



Page 27                                     ANNEX 3
lantern has 8-10 perforated plates, approximately 25 cm in diameter on which the scallops are placed.
These lanterns are suspended from nylon ropes that use hollow plastic balls as a means of floatation. The
density varies, but generally 60 to 80 chains will be placed on one hectare of water surface. The chains
are grown in a water depth of 5-7 meters. Scallops are filter feeders and require high quality water
conditions. They are sold in whole, live form or shucked, processed, and frozen for domestic
consumption or shipment abroad.
Clams
In Nantong, 9,050 ha of tidal flats will be developed for hard clams. Nantong has 100,000 ha of tidal flats
formed by the sediment produced by the Yangtze. The main investrnent items for clam culture are seed
clams, nets, and be(d preparation (shallow plowing). Seed clams are collected in spawning areas and
transplanted to growing beds in shallow intertidal areas that are not exposed for long periods. Nets are set
up to prevent loss of clams during storms. Hard clams grow for about 2-3 years before harvesting by
hand. The technique is similar for short neck clams (333 ha) and razor clams (133 ha ) in Weihai and
short neck clams (2,000 ha) in Yingkou. Arca shells will be cultivated on 667 ha in shallow water in
Yingkou; this involves broadcasting seed clams that are harvested after 3-4 years.
Laver
Production of laver (an edible seaweed) in the intertidal zones of China's coastal waters has been carried
out since 1985 and has experienced rapid growth' due to strong demand and attractive prices, especially
in Japan. Disease problems arose in the early 1990s, possibly due to high density of production. Since
then producers have reduced the density of growing racks and they have found that disease can be
controlled by refrigeration of algae ropes before placing on the growing racks. Laver is grown on rafts;
these are cradle-like devices made of bamboo. Spores attached to ropes are supported on the rafts. The
ropes are prepared in a hatchery enviromnent, and are refrigerated at temperature that can be tolerated by
the spores but kills competing algae. Harvesting takes place over a period of several months during
winter and spring. The wet laver is dried and pressed into thin sheets and used in a variety of foods.
Kelp
Kelp is a seaweed rich in iodine that is used as a raw material for pharmaceuticals and health foods. It is
grown in shallow water (less than 5m deep in the subtidal zone) on a suspended culture system. Seed
flakes are brought fiom a hatchery and cultured in a nursery until they are 10 cm long. They are then
attached to ropes with 60-80 a rope suspended from a raft made up of mooring ropes, clamping ropes and
floats. The rafts are moored to the sea bed by anchor ropes. Kelp culture is planned for 180 ha in Fujian.
The introduction of kelp in Hui An county, where there is presently little kelp production will
particularly benefit a relatively poor minority group.
Red Algae
Putian Bay, Fujian specializes in red algae (Bangia). It is planned for 200 ha. This product is cultured on
curtains of vinyl ropes stretched across a floating raft. The curtains are produced in hatchery conditions.
It is grown in the inter tidal zone. The rafts rest on the surface when the tide is high and on the beach at
low tide.

Spirulina
Spirulina is a warm-water, blue-green algae that is high in protein. The end product is a powder that is
used in numerous pharmaceutical and health food products. It is produced in indoor culture ponds using
heated water. The existing plant near Xiamen, to be expanded, takes advantage of a water supply from a
hot spring, that is bacteria-free, and has a favorable mineral content.
COMPONENT 3: SHRIMP POND REHABILITATION (US$10 million)
Summary
In recent years, the productivity of shrimp culture in the project areas has been severely reduced by
disease outbreaks. New methods of shrimp culture involve treatment of water in storage ponds, cleaning
of the grow-out ponds, aeration, and changes in pond design. These new techniques have produced
promising results in some areas, but caution in the pace of development is desirable. This component will
be phased during implementation until it is clear that the disease problems have been overcome and the
results are sustainable.
The project will support trials on a total of 1,010 ha of existing ponds distributed among the project areas
as follows: Fujian (750 ha), Weihai (150 ha) and Yingkou (160 ha). In each of the project areas it was
agreed that some of the ponds will be used for trials of polyculture and other promising alternatives to
shrimp cultivation. This is part of an ongoing program to explore new approaches to shrimp culture and
polyculture in existing shrimp ponds. The aim is to devise methods of pond management that could be
sustainable and profitable on a large scale. Trials will include but not be limited to:
-  polyculture of shrimp, fin fish, and shellfish in the same pond;
-  a two-pond system in which an existing shrimp pond is divided into two with one as a culture pond
and the other as a water treatment pond;
-  a system with a shrimp pond divided into three compartments with one for water treatment, the
second for shrimp culture, and the third for culture of bivalves to improve the effluent;
-  production of fin fish (tilapia, bass, mullet, etc.) in monoculture or polyculture in a one-pond or two-
pond system with, in the case of two ponds, bivalve culture in the effluent pond.
In addition, the project will support the establishment of China's first high-health shrimp hatchery, based
on specific pathogen free (SPF) breeding technology. This facility will be located in Qingdao.
Shrimp Disease
During the 1993 growing season and again in 1994, shrimp in the coastal areas of China were
infected by shrimp disease and heavy losses resulted. It is now generally believed that the virus
causing the disease is passed from the adult breeding stock in the hatchery to the post larvae and
appears when the shrimp reach a size of 6 to 8 cm. It is also possible that the virus is transmitted by
other marine organisms in the water. This makes the virus difficult to combat since it cannot be
isolated at one stage of development. Water quality and environmental conditions are probably
factors in the spread of the disease.
A team from a French consulting firm with wide experience in aquaculture, visited Fujian and Weihai in
October 1997 and carried out physical audits on the proposed trial locations to verify their suitability for
inclusion in the project. This activity was supported by the French government. The consultants have
developed a detailed methodology to determine how existing ecological conditions have a bearing on the



Page 29                                     ANNEX 3
prospects for restoring intensive shrimp culture. In some cases, the most rigorous application of new
techniques is not successful, whereas high productivity can be achieved where conditions are right. It has
applied its techniques with success in East Asia where the company has management contracts for
rehabilitated shrimp farms. Their detailed report is available in the project files.
COMPONENT 4: PRODUCT QUALITY AND SAFETY (US$32 million)
Summary
Some of China's main customers in North America and Europe have plans to raise standards of quality
and safety for aquatic products in the near future. These will follow the HACCP guidelines (Hazard
Analysis at Critical (Control Points). It is also expected that Chinese processors and consumers will soon
demand higher standards. To meet these demands, improvements will be needed in aquatic product
handling at all steps in production, marketing and processing. The project will invest in a number of
seafood handling operations, including processing and wholesale markets. In order to maintain good
hygiene standards and improve overall quality of seafood products, these facilities will be required to
apply standards based on the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) system to their
operations. The HACCP system has been developed through international cooperation and is a
preventive strategy of food safety and quality. The system is based on the concept that food safety
hazards exists at various points in the processing chain and that preventive measures at identified critical
control points (CCP) in that chain can reduce or eliminate potential food hazards. Controlling potential
hazards can ensure that overall quality is maintained. For project investments, application of the HACCP
system will ensure the safe handling of food and increase the potential for higher market prices based on
assured quality. These operations will serve as models in serving both the domestic and export markets.
A good start has been made in introducing the HACCP system to the project areas. In August 1997, a
two-week training course on HACCP was held at the National Center for Quality Supervision and
Testing of Aquatic Products in Qingdao for 50 participants, mainly food inspectors and processing 'plant
managers. The course instructors were two international leading seafood quality experts. The course
participants will now set up training programs in their respective provinces.
Main Elements of the HACCP System
Identification of Potential Risks. A food hazard is defined as a biological, chemical or physical
property that may cause a food to be unsafe for consumption. Hazard analysis requires a thorough
microbiological knowledge in combination with epidemiological and technological information on
potential hazards and how they can arise. This analysis must be quantitative and requires an assessment
of both severity and risk.
Determination of Critical Control Points. Critical Control Points are steps or procedures at which
control can be applied and a food safety hazard can be prevented, eliminated or reduced to an acceptable
level. CCPs are chosen on the basis of risk and the severity of the hazard. At every step or location
identified as a CCP, a detailed description of the preventive control measures taken at that point must be
developed.
Establishment of M[easurement Criteria, Target Levels and Tolerances. For each CCP, physical,
chemical and/or biological criteria must be determined and allowable limits established.
Establishment of a Monitoring System. A monitoring system must be developed which accurately
measures the factors which define a CCP and provides information in time for corrective actions to be



Page 30                                       ANNEX 3
taken. A monitoring system can be maintained on a continuous basis or at intervals based on the amount
of risk that is acceptable. Monitoring records are an integral part of the system.
Corrective Actions. The system must allow for corrective actions to be taken immediately when
monitoring results indicate that a CCP hazard is not under control.
Documentation and Record Keeping. The approved HACCP plan and all records must be kept on file,
and documentation at all steps is essential. To promote safe food handling and improve the overall
quality of seafood products, the project will promote the dissemination and use of the HACCP system in
two ways.
Project investments in seafood processing and wholesale markets will be designed to meet appropriate
Chinese standards which are based on the application of HACCP concepts. In addition, the project will
include training programs in HACCP concepts and applications for individuals and companies.
Seafood Handling Operations
The primary concern in handling aquatic products, fish and shell fish is the growth of bacteria. Bacteria
are present in all foods and it is not possible or necessary to remove all bacteria for the safety of the
aquatic products. But, bacteria must be prevented from multiplying to dangerous levels. Most of the
harmful bacteria can be avoided by icing or refrigeration with temperatures of 2 to 7C short-term, or by
freezing and cold storage at -20C. Ice, coolers and cold storage are essential for the prevention of
bacterial contamination.
Hepatitis A is most commonly associated with seafood, especially in the consumption of bivalves such as
clams, muscles, oysters, and scallops. Bivalves are filter feeders that mainly consume phytoplankton
from the water. Bivalves can accumulate pesticides, and other harmful matter including viruses. The
presence of viruses is dangerous since it cannot be noticed by taste, smell, or appearance. Careful
selection of culture areas is the first line of defense against this kind of contamination. If bivalves are
harvested from contaminated areas, it may be necessary to purge the harvested shellfish. Generally this
process takes 48 hours and consists of placing live harvested bivalves in clean water for purging their
digestive system. The water is then disinfected by use of chlorine or ultra violet light after purging. The
bivalves are then shucked and processed. Careful handling of shellfish and temperature control is
essential in the distribution chain.
Aquatic Product Safety. The most frequent causes of food-borne diseases related to aquatic products
are caused by improper holding temperatures, cross-contamination during processing, contaminated
equipment in the processing line, poor personal hygiene, and inadequate cooling of the product. The
handling of fish and shell fish is unique, and is different from other protein sources such as beef, pork or
poultry.
Food Handling. Food quality is the most important element in the HACCP program. The project will
support the development of seafood processing facilities and wholesale markets. These new operations
will be designed to Chinese standards which are based on the HACCP concept. HACCP based standards
will effect numerous aspects of the operations from storage and refrigeration facilities to the setup and
design of the processing line. The National Center for Quality Supervision and Testing of Aquatic
Products in Qingdao has recently begun issuing standards for the safe handling of seafood products based
on the HACCP concept. This organization will advise the food processing and wholesale markets
supported under the project.

Training. Training is an integral part of the HACCP concept and begins at the earliest stages of
implementation. The project will include training for individuals and companies in the concepts and
application of the HACCP system. Individuals from companies which are supported by the project will
participate in specific technical training organized by the National Center for Quality Supervision. These
individuals will then train employees of their organizations in HACCP concepts.
Wholesale Markets and Processing Plants in Fujian
The project will support the expansion and improvement of processing facilities and wholesale markets,
all of which will be designed to meet HACCP requirements. The project will also include training of
fishery officials, processors, market operators, etc. in HACCP concepts. Each processing facility to be
expanded or improved will meet the following criteria:
*  it is an expansion of an existing plant/market;
*  it is in sound financial condition with a record of profitable operation during the preceding three
years;
*  30 percent of more of its raw materials are cultured aquatic products; and
*  it will be able to export 10 percent of its production at full implementation.

Haixing Fishery Corporation. The Haixing Fishery Corporation is located in Longhai City, Fujian. It is
engaged in the production of cultured oysters and sea captured octopus, shrimp and crab. The plan is to
rehabilitate the existing processing equipment and add a roasting production line and a instant quick
freeze (IQF) production line. These lines will use cultured oyster, cultured pond shrimp, and sea captured
oysters and crab as raw materials. It will include 5 ton per day ice-making equipment and a 50 ton
storage facility. Annual production will increase from 350 tons to 920 tons.
Xiamen Fishery Processing Plant. The Xiamen Fishery Processing Plant is located in the economic
zone of Xiamen in Fujian Province. The plant has 800 m2 of processing area, 1,100 tons of cold store and
ice making capacity of 500 tons per day. It has river access and regularly supplies fishing boats with ice
and purchases pelagic fish such as skag and mackerel. The plant produces 140 tons per year. The plan is
to increase the area to 4,000 m2 and add equipment to increase plant capacity to 1,050 tons per year of
frozen shellfish, shrimp, and baked seafood.
Haiyang Industry Co., Ltd. The Haiyang Industry Co., Ltd. is one of ten companies and joint ventures
that are part of the Xiamen Ocean Industrial General Corporation. The group is a large fishing and
aquatic products processing organization involved in the international marketing of aquatic products. The
Company markets 50 different processed aquatic products, including many value-added products such
as: barbecued fish production, shrimp meat dumpling production and canned oyster production. The plan
is to add a barbecued fish processing line of 1,000 tons per year, a 950 ton shrimp meat dumpling line,
and a 1,000 ton canned oyster line. These will raise annual output to 7,500 tons.
Xiangzhi Fishery Foods Development Company. The Xiangzhi Fishery Foods Development Company
is engaged in the processing of marine-captured shrimp and fish and cultured oysters. In 1996, it had a
production of 548 tons, which included 103 tons of roasted shrimp, 122 tons of roasted fish filet, and 225
tons of bulk, frozen pelagic fish. The plan is for a canned oyster line as well as an additional fish
processing and shrimp roasting line. This will expand production to 2,650 tons per year.
Putian Aquatic Breeding Company. The Aquatic Breeding Center of Putian County is engaged in the
processing of shrimp and capture fish, including anchovy. The plan is to expand production by 1,750
tons of value-added products including kelp, frozen shucked shellfish, frozen sliced fish and frozen

Processing Plants in Nantong
Clam Processing Health Food Company. The plan is to relocate and expand an existing enterprise in
Rudong county, which started processing of hard clam shells in 1993. The plant is attached to a
pharmaceutical factory inside Jugang town with no space for expansion. The factory produces a



Page 33                                     ANNEX 3
medicinal powder from hard clams. The company is part of a larger pharmaceutical enterprise. The
present production of some 50 tons of powder using 650 tons of raw material in form of hard clam shells
cannot meet demand. The expected output of the new factory will be more than 200 tons of powder using
over 2,600 tons of hard clams. There is ample supply of raw material produced on the nearby tidal flats.
Processing Plant in Weihai. Rongcheng Cold Storage. This plant is involved in fish culturing, capture
fishing, and fisheries supply industries. After expansion, the plant will apply HACCP standards and serve
as example for other plants in the area. After expansion it will annually process about 10,000 tons of
oysters and scallops, 6,000 tons of kelp, and about 1,500 tons of fish and shrimp.
Processing Plants in Yingkou. River Crab Cold Storage. The plan is to provide a cold storage for river
crabs with a capacity of 80 tons in Yaogou village belonging to Shuiyuan town. River crabs are usually
harvested in autumn with a seasonal price low of Y 80 per kg in September and October. The price rises
to about Y 200 in early summer with few fresh crabs available for the markets at that time. Researchers
in Yingkou have discovered a way to store fresh crabs alive under constant low temperature conditions
over four to five months with very low losses. The crabs are stored on trays without water in a cooled
storehouse with controlled humidity. The survival rate is 95 to 96 percent. The facility will be used in
two shifts of 80 tons of fresh crab each. The output of the first one will be sold during the Chinese New
Year, and the second one will be sold in summer, when the price reaches a peak.
Yingkou Ocean Fishery Company. The existing factory has a capacity of about 5,000 to 6,000 tons of
fish raw material (mainly sea fish, arc-shells and shrimp). The project will invest in the upgrading and
modernization of the processing and freezing equipment including a quick fluid bed freezer. The major
objective will be to bring the factory to HACCP standards.

ANNEX 4: ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Approach: The major economic benefits of each component and the methods for quantification are
summarized in the table below. Detailed financial and economic analysis was undertaken for all
aquaculture and mariculture components and for the coastal protection forest. Production models were
developed to compare expected revenue with capital investment and operating costs. The period of
analysis for the aquaculture/mariculture components was 10 years, for the coastal forest protection and
the fishery processing component, it was 30 years and 20 years respectively.

2 Including an expansion of activities, a different combination of activities and new activities (e.g. tourism).
3 In both cases an IRR would only be illustrative (e.g. if 5 or 10 percent of the losses could be avoided (potential production output could be
materialized) due to project investment the IRR would be as high as xx percent respectively yy percent). It should be clear that there are
two sets of benefits; (a) losses avoided based on existing use of coastal resources, and (b) improved resource efficiency based on a future
more optimal use of coastal resources.
4 There are also benefits, which can be allocated to single activities, too; for example, the resource protection benefit from surveillance boats
can be extremely high assuming a without situation, where a potential polluter (e.g. oil tanker cleaning the tanks) would be able to destroy
thousands of hectares mariculture, if there is no risk of being caught and punished. The question is to find an optimal level of protection,
and this can be answered only by assessing the total value of what needs to be protected and the risk of destruction.
5 In a situation of overfishing each fish added to the stock has the same economic value as a comparable fish taken out from the stock. What
counts is to know how many fry/fingerling make it to the adult stage.
For fish released to protected areas the value is different, since this fish has a higher potential as broodstock. Similarly, catching a fish in
protected areas would cause a damage greater than the commercial value of the caught fish.
6 This investment is knowledlge oriented. The knowledge gained from the trials has a multiplier effect for the whole area of existing shrimp
ponds, which are planned to be rehabilitated. Assuming that the trials prove that model A is superior to model B by a net value of x
yuan/ha, and that without project an amount of ponds of y hectare would have been remodeled for model B, the total benefit would be x
times y hectare no matter what the size of the trial is area is.
7 Again the economic viability of this component can only be assessed in an illustrative way, since the results of the trails are not available.
However, it can be said that the investment would become economidally viable, if it finds a model suitable for x hectare of ponds with
relative higher net return of x yuan per hectare.
Risk parameters have been estimated and are included in the economic cash flow analysis for all
aquaculture/mariculture components. These parameters take into account the probability of loosing part
or all of the production due to typhoons, red tides, pests, diseases or similar environmental hazards. The
parameters are based on relatively high risk scenarios. The analysis therefore results in a very
conservative estimation of the economic returns. For example for the fish cage production components a
loss of 20 percent of the production annually was assumed, equal to the probability of a complete loss
every five years.
Financial prices were used for all traded and nontraded inputs and outputs to reflect their economic
values. The prevailing liberalization of the Chinese economy and the fact that most of the goods

produced under this project will be directly produced for or will compete with products on foreign
markets does not suggest adjustments for internal price distortions. The wage rate of Y 40 per day for
unskilled labor reflects the opportunity costs of labor in the coastal areas.
Coastal Forest Protection: The project will invest in the plantation of 1,300 ha of coastal protection
forest in Nantong. The forests planted as belts with a width of about 80 m will have a total length of
160 km. This afforestation has direct benefits from forest products (firewood, rafter, and timber) and
indirect benefits from wind protection for the adjacent agricultural crops. The windbreak is estimated to
have a significant positive impact on a strip of land as wide as about 15 to 20 times the height of the
trees.
80 m                       15 to 20 times the height of the trees
The trees, after reaching a height of about 15 m in 25 years, will therefore protect some 3 to 4,000 ha of
agricultural land, which is double cropped with wheat, peanut, soybean, and cotton. Economic crop
budgets for the "without project" and "with project" case have been estimated for both the afforested
area and for the adjacent agricultural crops. The yield increase after full development is estimated to be
about 6-7 percent for wheat, peanut and soybean, and about 18 percent for cotton, which will result in an
additional annual production of 900 tons of wheat, 80 tons of cotton, 200 tons of soybean and 200 tons of
peanut. Production costs will increase by 2 percent. The annual net economic benefits from agricultural
cropping will be about Y 2.5 million after full development (see graphic on next page). The investment
will generate an estimated ERR of 16 percent.
Fish: The 200 cage units in Fujian and the 19 units in Weihai will produce more than 11,000 tons of high
value sea fish each year. The fingerlings will increasingly come from artificial breeding and hatching.
The cultivation of fish in cages is financially very attractive, but the cages are potentially prone to
typhoon damage. In the economic analysis a conservative approach has been taken assuming that 20
percent of the output would be lost each year. The ERR under this scenario is nevertheless high with 28
percent in Fujian and 27 percent in Weihai.
Some 350 tons of puffer fish will be produced in 191 ha of ponds in a new reclamation area in Nantong.
These ponds will be constructed in an area which has already been reclaimed from the sea by a large sea
dike. The area is part of the new land, which is formed continuously by the deposition of the sediment
load transported by the Yangtze River. While there are significant sunk costs, there remain relatively
high investment costs for the construction of these ponds and for the necessary infrastructure in the area.
The ERR from puffer production is estimated at 16 percent. These ponds can also be used for culturing
other species, such as blue crabs, which reduces the risk to the operator.

Years
Shellfish: The use of shallow water for shellfish cultivation constitutes one of the most productive
methods to produce high value protein food for human consumption. The per hectare productivity of
oyster meat in suspended oyster cultivation is about 8 tons, and for scallops it is about 5 tons. Notably,
this production is obtained without the use of such inputs as feed or fertilizer. No land based food
production system can compete with such high productivity.
Fujian province has potential for suspended cultivation of shellfish of 44,000 ha, of which about
15,000 ha are currently used. The project will develop 4,446 ha of suspended oyster, producing about
350,000 tons of fresh oysters equivalent to 35,000 tons of oyster meat, and 260 ha of scallops with an
estimated output of 12,870 tons of fresh scallops. The estimated ERR is 21 percent for oyster and 23
percent for scallop production.
Mud flat areas under tidal influence also provide large potential for high productivity mariculture. Since
those areas are largely unused, the opportunity costs on these areas, like for the shallow sea water, are
minimal. Particularly in Nantong, where the sediment carried by the Yangtze river continuously adds to
the land base, the production potential is large. The project will develop 11,400 ha of this land for the
production of beach clam. The output is estimated to be about 22,000 tons, and the ERR of this
investment is estimated at 20 percent. In Weihai 566 ha of mud flats will be developed for oyster, short-
neck clams, and razor clams. The ERRs range from 23 to 26 percent.



Page 46                                      ANNEX 4
Another form of shellfish production is to place the seed on the ground in shallow water areas near the
coastline with permanent water cover. In Yingkou the project will develop 2,000 ha of short-neck clam
and 667 ha of arc-shell production. The estimated output is 4,000 tons of short-neck clams and 220 tons
of arc-shell, which will generate ERRs of 21 percent and 16 percent for short-neck clam and arc-shell
respectively.
Sea Weed: Individual area models on a per hectare bases have been established to estimate the ERRs for
the kelp, red hair algae, and laver production components. The ERRs range from 24 percent for kelp to
29 percent for red hair algae. The 180 ha of kelp production in Fujian will only marginally contribute the
total kelp production of the province, which has an area of about 4,600 ha under cultivation. However,
the introduction of kelp in Hui An county, will particularly support a relatively poor minority group. The
output of fresh kelp will be 5,040 tons annually and the ERR is estimated at 24 percent.
Spiral algae are produced in indoor tanks using heated water. The specific advantage of the proposed
production plant is based on its particular water source. The water comes from a hot spring, is extremely
clean, and has a favorable mineral content. This situation is uniquely suited for the production of spiral
algae. In an existing small production unit valuable experiences in the production technology have
already been gained. The ERR for this component is estimated at 23 percent.
Hatcheries: The project will support the development of 26 hatcheries for the propagation of 17 species.
Most of these hatcheries will produce seed for the production components under the project. Seed and fry
are an intermediate output, which have no direct economic benefit. The economic benefits arise from the
production of the final product and are therefore incorporated in the benefit calculations of the
mariculture/aquaculture components.
In Weihai the project will support the expansion of a multispecies hatchery producing fry, for a
restocking program. The additional annual release in number of fry/seed will be: 2 million flounder, 3
million abalone, 3.6 million sea cucumber, and 0.5 million turbot. Most of this seed will be released to
areas for recatch and some will be specially brought to protected areas, where it will contribute to the
natural restocking capacity of the sea. Financially, this stock enhancement program is attractive, because
it will generate revenue through licenses sold to fishermen for fishing in the release areas. None of these
species is migrating, and, according to long-term experiences, about 20 percent of the flounder and
turbots are expected to be recaptured as adult fish. For sea cucumber and abalone it is about 70 percent.
Based on these recapturing rates the ERR would be 31 percent. However, the economic benefits of this
component might be even higher, since each fish, which remains in the sea will contribute to the
restocking and will have the same economic value as a fish taken out from the sea.
Shrimp Pond Rehabilitation: Currently it is uncertain how to use or modify shrimp ponds that have
suffered from the shrimp disease. Various production alternatives will be tested. In a sample analysis the
estimated cash flow situation for an investment in shrimp reconstruction based on the so-called Thai-
Model is compared with two different alternative production systems using existing ponds without major
investments; one is based on polyculture of shrimp and razor clams, and the other is based on a
continuation of traditional shrimp monoculture. The analysis shows an annual net return from the
reconstructed ponds of Y 3,128, from polyculture of Y 2,858, and from traditional monoculture of
Y 1,951 per mu effective production pond size. The reconstructed ponds have the highest net returns,
however, the relative advantage of the modified ponds over polyculture of Y 270 would not pay for the
investment of Y 4,222 per mu, which is necessary to reconstruct the ponds. The investment would only
be viable if compared with traditional shrimp monoculture. Clearly, not all alternatives are suitable for
the different environments in China. The project will help to find the best alternative for particular



Page 47                                       ANNEX4
situations. The potential benefits of selecting the right model are large considering China's large total
shrimp pond area of about 200,000 ha.
Financial Analysis: For all aquaculture/mariculture components a financial cash flow analysis has been
done for both a standard production situation and under consideration of special risks. The analysis
includes realistic loan repayment assumptions and interest rates for investment and working capital as
well as deductions for taxes. All production components are financially attractive even under
consideration of high losses. The IRR for marine aquaculture components is 25 percent even assuming
losses of 10-20 percent.
The project is expected to generate tax revenues of approximately Y 400 million.
Financial analyses have been done for all hatcheries, the aquaculture processing enterprises and for the
expansion of the wholesale markets in Fujian.
Risk and Sensitivity Analysis: Clearly, all mariculture and aquaculture production components involve
elements of risk related to weather, diseases, or other environmental hazards. However, the high
profitability of these production systems has resulted in the development of intensive cultivation all
along the coasts in China. Most of the production systems proposed under the project have been
successfully tested in China and are usually practiced already on a large scale. These experiences show
that the high profitability more than balances for the risks. The analysis proves that even with the
inclusion of significant risk parameters the investments pay off in a very short time. The weighted ERR
of all aquaculture components is 23 percent for an evaluated period of 10 years. Without the risk
parameters the ERR would be as high as 68 percent.
Another element of risk could arise from changing markets and prices for the average species produced.
The cages and ponds, however, are not species specific and can be used for other types of fish in
response to better market prospects. The hatcheries follow a standard design with standard equipment,
and they can be easily changed to raise other species. The only investment, which is product specific is
the investment in laver processing. But the Japanese market for laver is well established and stable.

ANNEX 5: PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT
ARRANGEMENTS
PROCUREMENT
The Guidelines for procurement under IBRD Loans and Credits published by the Bank in January 1995
and revised in January and August 1996 and September 1997 will be applied to all Bank-financed
procurement of goods and works. The Model Documents developed by the Ministry of Finance and the
Bank in July 1996 will be adopted for all international competitive bidding (ICB) and national
competitive bidding (NCB) for civil works and goods, and the Standard Bid Evaluation Form will be
used. The project areas are in four provinces and extend 2,000 km from Yingkou Municipality in the
north to Xiamen, the most southerly project area in Fujian. Each province will manage its own
procurement for buildings and for most items of equipment, but some specialized equipment to be
procured through ICB will be packaged for centralized procurement. Procurement arrangements are
shown in Table A.
Civil Works and Buildings
Some 55 buildings worth about $58 million will be required for coastal management and monitoring
centers, hatcheries, markets and processing plants. These will be procured through NCB where the
estimated cost of a contract exceeds $1 million. Contracts with a value below $1 million will be procured
through NCB except for advertising procedures as described below. These contracts are not expected to
attract any competition outside the respective provinces or in some cases, neighboring provinces. For all
buildings, contracts will cover the structural works and services such as water and power supply, boilers,
pumps and air conditioning. They will be carried out by experienced general contractors who will be
responsible for the supply and installation of equipment for the above described services. Contracts for
buildings with estimated costs above $1 million will be advertised in the national press. For contracts
below that amount advertisement will be in the leading provincial newspaper, with one summary
advertisement in the national press.
Goods
Goods worth about $25 million will be required for the project. Items to be procured through ICB will
amount to $9.3 million and include fishery control boats ($2.2 million), processing equipment ($3
million), specialized office and laboratory equipment ($0.6 million), and vehicles ($3.5 million).
Qualified domestic bidders competing under ICB will be eligible for a preference in bid evaluation of 15
percent of the c.i.f. price or the actual custom duties and import tax, whichever is less. Numerous other
items of equipment for the centers, hatcheries, and processing plants, none of which can be efficiently
grouped into packages of more than $250,000, will be procured through international shopping, or
national shopping if the amount is below $100,000.
Marine Aquaculture and Shrimp Rehabilitation
Aquaculture production includes construction of net cages for fish, rafts and suspension systems for
bivalves, kelp, algae and laver, and creation of clam beds. Shrimp rehabilitation includes rehabilitation of
shrimp ponds for trials. The total cost of these facilities is on the order of $100 million. They will be
implemented over a period of five years at widely dispersed locations. In general they will be installed by



Page 51                                     ANNEX5
they will be installed by the owner-operators who will use materials that are widely available in the local
markets. Marine aquaculture and shrimp rehabilitation items may be procured at a reasonable price,
account being taken also of other relevant factors, such as time of delivery and efficiency and reliability
of the goods and availability of maintenance facilities and spare parts thereof, and, in the case of
services, of their quality and the competence of the parties rendering them.
Consulting Services
Employment of consultants will be in accordance with the "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers," published by the Bank in January 1997, and revised in
September 1997, and the Bank's Standard request for proposal dated July 1997, will be used. Services of
firms will be procured in accordance with QCBS procedures; those of individuals will be procured in
accordance with the procedures specified in the Consultant Guidelines for Employment of Individual
Consultants. This would include contracts for coastal zone management ($0.3 million), shrimp disease
control ($0.25 million), hatchery technology ($0.2 million) and HACCP TA ($0.25 million).
World Bank Review
For goods, all contracts of $100,000 or more will be subject to prior review. This will cover about 45
percent of the total value of goods. Contracts for building and civil works of $3 million or more will be
subject to prior review. ODther contracts will be subject to ex-post review by supervision missions. In each
project area, the first contract in each year irrespective of value would be reviewed, and subsequently
about 1 in 4 contracts on a random basis. This ratio would be reviewed during the mid-term review.
Contracts for consulting services of $100,000 or more for firms and $50,000 or more for individuals will
be subject to prior revielw.
DISBURSEMENT
To allow an early start on the priority components of the project, such as hatcheries, shrimp
rehabilitation trials, net cages, monitoring centers, and training, retroactive financing in the amount of
$10 million is recommended for payments made after December 1, 1997.
Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) will be required for disbursements made against (a) contracts for
goods costing less than $250,000 and for works costing less than $3 million, (b) contracts for consulting
firms costing less than $100,000 and for individuals costing less than $50,000, (c) study tours and
training and (d) marine aquaculture items. Disbursement for marine item will be made against statements
of physical progress at unit prices agreed with the Bank at appraisal and subject to annual review. Five
Special Accounts will be established, one in each of the project areas (including Xiamen) in banks
acceptable to the World Bank, with authorized allocations aggregating $8.8 million ($6 million for
Fujian, $0.8 million for each of Jiangsu, Liaoning and Shandong, and $0.4 million for Xiamen). The
proceeds of the Loan will be disbursed as shown in Table C.

ANNEX 7: RESETTLEMENT GUIDELINES
Introduction
Based on the Government's and the Bank's review of subprojects proposed for financing, no resettlement
is anticipated at this time. Should additional subprojects involving land acquisition be selected during
project implementation, the Chinese Government and the World Bank have agreed on the following
guidelines to ensure equitable and effective treatment of resettlement issues under the project.
Legal Framework
As reviewed in a recent World Bank Report on involuntary resettlement in China (Report No. 11641-
CHA), Chinese law and regulation now generally meet the requirements of the World Bank Operational
Directive on resettlement and the resettlement guidelines of the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development. The major laws and regulations that bear on resettlement under the Project include the
following:
*  The "Regulations on the Requisition of Land for State Construction" (1982) provides for
compensation based on the requirements for restoring income.
D  The "Land Administration Law" (1986) and related amendments (1988) require that incomes and
assets be protected during resettlement and that affected communities be consulted during the project
design stage. In addition, resettlers are given the specific right to challenge resettlement decisions in
the courts. The laLw gives affected cities, counties, and collectives responsibility for implementing
resettlement and provides guidance on resettlement principles, organization, and compensation.
Provinces are required to draw up implementing regulations that conform to the national legislation,
which define more precisely resettlement procedures and compensation for various types of land and
other property. Provinces may also gives cities and counties the right to enact additional resettlement
regulations conforming to national and provincial law.
*  National regulations pertaining to urban resettlement were published in 1984 and laid out
administrative procedures for urban land acquisition and compensation. They serve as enabling
regulations for municipalities, which then developed resettlement procedures and compensation
arrangements appropriate to their situation. The "Administrative Regulations for House Removal in
Cities" (1991) introduced updated and more comprehensive regulations for urban resettlement. This
regulation specifies (a) consultation requirements, including public announcements of the proposed
project, to be followed by individual consultation with affected households; (b) grievance
procedures; and (c) the principle of full replacement value for expropriated housing, whether owned
or rented.
Resettlement Principles for the Project
The Chinese Government and the Bank have agreed on the following principles for resettlement under
the project:
* Involuntary resettlement will be avoided or minimized where feasible; to this end, subborrowers of
project funds will explore all viable alternative project designs.
* All resettlement activities will conform with existing Chinese laws and regulations at the national,
provincial, city and county levels.



Page 56                                       ANNEX7
*  Affected persons will be consulted during the planning and implementation of resettlement activities.
In particular, they will be informed of the resettlement plans and their options and legal rights prior
to the initiation of any resettlement activity; institutionalized arrangements will be established to
facilitate communication during the planning and implementation of resettlement; and an effective
and well-understood grievance process will be developed.
*  Affected persons will be resettled within their original village whenever possible. If this is not
possible, they will be resettled as close as possible to their original village. The principles for
selecting relocation sites will be: (a) within the same village, (b) to adjacent villages within the same
xiang; (c) other villages within the same xiang; (d) to adjacent xiangs; (e) other xiangs within the
same counties; and (e) adjacent counties.
*  Affected persons will be resettled in similar livelihoods: where possible, agriculture workers will be
resettled with agricultural jobs, industrial workers will be resettled with industrial jobs. If this is not
possible, affected persons will be insured suitable employment in an endeavor other than that of their
previous employment, and will receive retraining where necessary to rend them suitable for such
employment.
*  Affected persons will be resettled as groups whenever possible to reduce social disruptions.
*  Valuation of lost assets will be made at full replacement cost.
*  The total level of compensation will insure that the living standards, income earning capacity, and
production levels are improved, or at least do not deteriorate, as a result of their resettlement.
Implementation Arrangements
Organizational Responsibilities. The project's executive agencies, the Provincial/Municipal Project
Management Offices (PMOs) in the four participating provinces will have overall responsibility for
supervising and monitoring the implementation of all resettlement plans. The PMOs will be assisted by
the local resettlement authorities, comprising the local Land Administration Bureaus, Land Valuation
Bureaus, Village, Municipal, Township or County government with authority over the subproject site.
The subprojects' management teams will be responsible for the preparation and approval process, and
monitoring of resettlement plans. These teams will act on behalf of the subprojects' sponsoring
enterprises. The implementation of all resettlement plans will be subject to the approval and clearance of
such plans by the relevant local authorities. The PMOs will coordinate closely with these authorities with
respect to the monitoring of approved resettlement plans.
Where resettlement will be part of a subproject proposal, the PMOs, in consultation with the Provincial
Finance Bureaus, would approve subloans conditional on submission by the subproject sponsor of a
resettlement plan meeting principles and procedures satisfactory to the PMOs, local authorities, and the
Bank. The resettlement plan's scope would be consistent with agreed upon guidelines, based on the
broad criteria outlined in paras 6 and 7.
Resettlement Plans. A resettlement plan will be prepared for each and every subproject that involves
land acquisition or displacement of people. The content and level of detail of the resettlement plan will
vary with the magnitude of the resettlement.
When more than 200 individuals are affected in a subproject, a comprehensive resettlement plan for that
subproject will be prepared that addresses the following issues:
* organizational responsibilities;
* community participation and integration with host populations;
* socioeconomic survey;
* legal framework;



Page 57                                       ANNEx 7
* alternative sites and selection;
*  valuation of and compensation for lost assets;
*  land tenure, acquisition, and transfer;
*  access to training, employment, and credit;
*  shelter, infrastructure, and social services;
*  environmental protection and management;
*  implementation schedule, monitoring, and evaluation; and
*  detailed cost estimrates.
When 200 or less individuals are affected in a subproject, a summary resettlement plan for that
subproject will be prepared that addresses the following issues:
*  organizational responsibilities;
*  community participation and integration with host populations;
*  valuation of and compensation for lost assets;
*  implementation schedule, monitoring, and evaluation; and
*  detailed cost estimates.
World Bank Review of Resettlement Plans. The World Bank's prior approval of each resettlement
plan will be required.
Sources of Funding fror Resettlement. No funds will be made available in the project budget for the
funding of resettlement costs. These costs will be primarily borne by the subproject's sponsor or the
subproject itself. The enterprise or agency responsible for funding will, as part of the necessary
documentation for loan approval, show proof to the PMOs it has designated the necessary funds to
support the financial cost of such a plan and that the disbursement of these funds is time-bound to the
implementation scheduile prepared for the plan. The determination of resettlement costs will be based on
the principles of land acquisition and resettlement, and will be implemented in accordance with existing
local land administration and other resettlement laws, as interpreted. Where relevant, local government
agencies may contribute to resettlement costs by providing assets lost as the result of land acquisition
such as the provision of new or alternate housing, or land.
Monitoring and Evaluiation
Monitoring Structure. A resettlement monitoring structure will be set up as part of the overall project
management infrastructure and will comprise, in hierarchical order, the PMOs in the Provincial Finance
Departments as the project's chief monitoring coordinators, in collaboration with prefecture, county and
municipal Project Management Offices (PMOs). The highest level PMOs will receive approved
resettlement plans, other relevant data, and progress reports directly from the lower level PMOs.
Resettlement monitoring will provide an early warning system for project managers via the PMOs,
which would insure information objectivity through direct, in-house monitoring. A channel for resettlers
to make known their needs would be established, from the local authorities or the subproject monitoring
unit, directly to the PMOs. Monitoring progress reports would be submitted by subproject management
units to the local PMOs and forwarded up to the provincial PMOs, as part of the routine semiannual
subproject progress reporting. During the first year of subproject implementation, the PMOs will have
the right, where warranted, to request more frequent progress update reports. Base line and
implementation socioeconomic surveys on resettlement plans involving over 200 persons will be carried
out to compare the without and with-subproject effects of resettlement on affected persons. Bank review
of the monitoring progress will be at semiannual intervals during the first year of subproject
implementation and annually thereafter, throughout the project's implementation period.
