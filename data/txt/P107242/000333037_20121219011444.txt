1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design
(This section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., Program Document/ISR, not evaluative):

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country macroeconomic and structural/sector background, rationale for Bank
assistance)

Country Context. Classified by the UN as one of the least developed countries, the Lao
People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is a land-locked nation of 236,000 square km
with a population of about 6.0 million (2008). It is among the world’s poorest countries
and also the poorest in East Asia, according to the Bank’s Atlas estimates, with an
estimated per capita income of US$740 in 2008 at the start of the second series of
Poverty Reduction Support Operations (PRSOs). Major social indicators have also been
improving, although progress is uneven. On many indicators, however, Laos still
compares poorly with other countries in the region.

Macroeconomic Context. Lao PDR continues to enjoy rapid economic growth and has
made much progress with poverty reduction. In the 1990s, real GDP growth averaged
more than 6 percent a year and this performance has been sustained in the 2000s. The
economy has performed particularly well in recent years. Macroeconomic conditions
remain relatively stable, reflecting monetary and fiscal discipline, with inflation in single
digits for the last several years, public expenditures coming increasingly under control,
and increased revenue-mobilization efforts underway.

Agriculture remains a mainstay of the economy, albeit with declining importance. It
contributed around 32 percent of GDP (in 2009) and employs nearly 70 percent of the
labor force at the beginning of the second PRSO series. The industry sector accounts for
almost 28 percent of GDP, while the share of services in GDP is nearly 41 percent. At
the same time, the country is endowed with significant natural resources including
forestry, minerals and terrains suited to hydro-electric power with enormous trade
potential. Indeed, it is already an exporter of this product to neighboring countries, in
addition to its exports of minerals, garments, agricultural goods, and wood and wood
products. On the other hand, imports consist mostly of industrial and capital goods,
petroleum, food and other consumer products from neighboring countries and from Asia
in general. Following the successful launch of the Nam Theun 2 Hydroelectric Project
(NT2), the economy experiences a surge in project investment imports and FDI.

Progress with poverty reduction in the Lao PDR has been impressive over the past decade.
Available estimates suggest that a significant decline in poverty has been achieved during
the 1990s: poverty in the country has declined from 46 percent in 1992/93 to 28 percent
in 2007/8 (national poverty line, based on minimum calorie intake). The share of the
population in poverty was reduced by 30 percent in one decade, lifting one-eighth of the
total population out of poverty. Even though the population grew by more than one
million people between 1993 and 2008, the absolute number of the poor declined from
about 2.1 million to just over 1.5 million. The Lao PDR Poverty Assessment showed that
the greatest reductions in poverty headcount happened in the areas that were selected by

the Poverty Reduction Strategy as priority districts for poverty reduction efforts,
including targeted interventions.

Path of Reforms. The Government of the Lao PDR has been on the path of structural
shift from centrally-planned system to a market-oriented economy, initially with the
introduction of the New Economic Mechanism (NEM) in 1986. The NEM removed price
controls, abandoned socialist cooperative farming; farmers were allowed to work on their
plots and asserted ownership; the multiple exchange rate system was unified;
government’s monopoly on trade removed; the number of SOEs reduced, and the
establishment of private firms allowed. It has made progress in a wide-ranging structural
reform agenda and applied continued effort in key reform areas. These have been
reinforced by the government’s commitment in its 5th and 6th National Socio-Economic
Development Plans (NSEDP) and in the Poverty Reduction Strategy called National
Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES), and supported by the Bank’s first
PRSO series -- PRSO-1 to PRSO-3 -- which was successfully concluded in 2004/05. 1

The NSEDP for 2006-2010 demonstrated the government’s continuing commitment to
shared growth and social development, to poverty reduction and structural reforms, the
strategy and framework outlined in the NGPES in 2004 The World Bank Group’s
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Lao PDR built on the NGPES/NSEDP, and the
PRSO program formed an integral part of this strategy. The PRSO series were also built
upon a strong program of analytical and advisory (AAA) work by the Bank and
complemented the Bank Group’s other activities in Lao PDR, including the satisfactory
implementation of the NT2 project.

The PRSO series. Built on the achievements of the first PRSO series, the second series
which covered PRSO-4 to PRSO-7 2 was designed as an integral part of the Bank’s
strategy to further support the implementation of the NSEDP and the NGPES in two
ways. First, it continued to deepen the achievements under the first series. Second, it
incorporated the lessons learned with regard to implementation, such as benefits of
greater focus and addressing binding capacity constraints. PRSOs 4-7 pursued a set of
reforms aiming at sustaining high economic growth; and ensured that the benefits of this
growth accrue to the poor, through continuation of the comprehensive reform of the
public financial system. PRSOs 4-7 deepened the public financial management reforms
through strengthening the central-local fiscal framework, implementing the legislative

           The first series addressed a wide range of policy reforms, including a focus on public finance management,
improving state-owned companies’ and state-owned banks’ performance; alignment of the expenditures with NGPES
priorities, especially in infrastructure, health and education; and a range of actions directed at improving revenue
management, poverty data, and investment climate. PRSOs 1-3 were based on Lao PDR’s continued maintenance of an
adequate macroeconomic framework, continued commitment to the poverty reduction strategy, and adequate
implementation of the agreed reform program. World Bank, Program Document for the First PRSO, Report No.

acts approved by the National Assembly and the government during the first series, and
focusing on improving service delivery in health and education. The second series also
established a new front of reforms directed at improving the investment climate and
quality of incoming investment, through focusing on leveling the playing field for
businesses of all sizes, ownership, and location; elimination of at-the-border and behind-
the-border constraints to trade, and proposed actions to manage effectively public
investment in the natural resource sectors. PRSOs 4-7 paid special attention to the
“criticality principle? for budget support operations and focused the reform agenda on
seven key prior actions and policy actions in each operation. It incorporated lessons
learned from the previous series, especially with respect to addressing risks related to
capacity constraints. In addition, as programmatic budget support, the PRSO series
aimed at increasing the predictability of funding, maintaining the associated policy
dialogue between government and donors, sharper policy prioritization, and
strengthening donor coordination. The second series was based on progress made in and
continued adequacy of the macroeconomic framework.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The second programmatic series of PRSOs (PRSO-4 to PRSO-7) supported the
implementation of the Lao PDR’s Poverty Reduction Strategy with its key principles for
effective poverty reduction incorporated in the Sixth NSEDP. This strategy focused on
the following objectives: (i) sustaining growth through improvement of the investment
climate, facilitating trade and management of natural resources; and (ii) improving social
outcomes through better public financial management system and service delivery.

The PRSO series contributed to the following list of outcomes and indicators:

    1. Streamlining of regulations for setting up and operating business as measured by
       the number of days it takes to start up a business;
    2. Streamlining of cross-border procedures to reduce trade barriers;
    3. Reduction in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) losses, greater transparency and
       commercial viability; more modern and better performing banking sector;
    4. Improved credibility of budget planning, transparency and comprehensiveness of
       budget reporting and faster budget execution;
    5. Timeliness and quality of external audits;
    6. Improving service delivery and management, allocation, and monitoring of
       education expenditures; and
    7. Improved access to health care and financial protection; effective performance
       monitoring for health sector policy.

1.3 Revised PDO (if any, as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification

There was no revision to the PDO and Key Indicators.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by Program (as approved) (for DPL only)

Within the above framework, and following the cross-sectoral approach under the first
PRSO series, the second series provided support in the following key areas:

   (i) improving the investment climate, competitiveness, and business development in
        order to establish an environment conducive to sustainable export- and private
        sector-driven growth; and
   (ii) strengthening the overall public finance management framework to enable to
        government to increase efficiency o the public resource allocation system,
        strengthen fiduciary controls, and improve service delivery.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable) (for DPL only)

There was no revision to policy areas.

1.6 Other Significant Changes (if applicable)

There were no changes in the second series in terms of the reforms framework and key
policy areas. However, the involvement of the donor community through the PRSO
vehicle became more extensive, from participating in the policy dialogue to funding for
technical assistance, providing parallel budget-support funding, and in actual
participation in the preparation of the PRSO series. The European Commission
participated in the appraisal mission for all the four PRSOs, especially in the education
and health sectors. The Government of Japan also participated in the preparatory
activities on trade, SOE restructuring, and business promotion. AusAID was actively
involved in the areas for trade, public financial management (PFM), and education.
Other development partners are the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in banking reforms,
GTZ in microfinance, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in macroeconomic
management, the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) in Public Finance
Management and Public Finance Management Strengthening Program (PFMSP), the
UNDP, and UNCTAD. Toward the end of the second PRSO series, the PRSO-7 served
as a donor-supported coordination vehicle to assist the Lao PDR in its reform program.

                                            financial sector infrastructure). The strategy --

and implementation plan for developing a adopt a system of proper budget allocation
sector budget norm-based revenue sharing norms to guide the allocation of provincial
system for implementation from the budget for health and education. The norms
FY2010/11 budget.                           would serve as mandatory requirements for
                                            minimum spending per capita that provinces
                                            will have to follow in allocating their own fiscal
                                            resource for education and health spending
                                            within the province in FY2009/10. In addition,
                                            a strategy and implementation plan for
                                            developing a sector budget norm-based revenue

                                            FY2010/11 budget was finalized.
5. MOF adopted the Treasury Single Completed.
Account (TSA) framework by consolidating The government has adopted the TSA
all revenue accounts into Treasury managed framework requiring all spending agencies to
accounts and started implementation of this transfer control of their bank accounts to the
framework                                   centralized national treasury. To date, MOF
                                            managed to gain control over all provincial
                                            treasury accounts, extra-budgetary funds like
                                            the road fund, and budgetary accounts of line
                                            ministries. Budget revenues collected by the tax
                                            and customs departments are deposited into
                                            these bank accounts. Approximately 80 percent
                                            of total public finances flow through these
                                            accounts. The remaining 20 percent represent
                                            bank accounts held by spending agencies
                                            collecting technical revenues.
                                            The rationale was to ensure that the MOF’s
                                            Treasury Department gains centralized control

                                                  over spending accounts across the country in
                                                  order to enhance fiduciary control over public
                                                  finances and to improve cash management.
                                                  The MOF has continued implementation of the
                                                  TSA framework the following years by
                                                  consolidating these accounts into the Treasury

                                                  is a necessary pillar of a well functioning public
                                                  finance management system. Efforts will in the

                                                 channels budgetary resources to facilities in the

                                                 other recurrent expenditures, but government
                                                 spending on health is insufficient to cover the
                                                 full cost of services. Despite efforts to expand
                                                 both health insurance programs (mandatory
                                                 and voluntary) and health equity funds for the
                                                 poor, coverage of these schemes remains low.
                                                 The heavy reliance on out-of-pocket payments
                                                 results in considerable financial barriers to
                                                 utilization of health services, contributing to
                                                 low levels of utilization and significant health-
                                                 related financial risk. Progress towards
                                                 addressing these challenges will depend on
                                                 how the system for financing health care in
                                                 Lao PDR evolves over the coming years.
                                                 Rationale for reformulation: more time than
                                                 initially expected was required for MOH to

                                               legislation was the implementing decree.
                                               Reason for reformulation was therefore to keep

                                               element, as well as to reflect the timing of

                                               locally produced goods are treated equally. It is
                                               an essential part of bringing the Lao legal
                                               framework for trade in line with the principles

                                               The wording of the prior action has been
                                               modified for two reasons. Firstly, while the
                                               legislation which this new Decree is intended
                                               to     replace    refers    to   "Import-Export
                                               Management", the new Decree will be titled
                                               "Import and Export of Goods" to better reflect
                                               efforts by the Government to move towards a
                                               transparent and open regulatory regime for
                                               trade. Secondly, a new set of implementing
                                               regulations are no longer required to support
                                               the introduction of the new Decree as the
                                               implementing regulations for the PM Decree

                                                   the Action Plan of the Financial Sector
                                                   Strategy. BOL has proposed since then 2
                                                   actions, one on microfinance decree and one on
                                                   revision of banking sector prudential rules.
                                                   These 2 actions become the 2 new prior
                                                   actions. To reduce the number of actions and

                                             The SAO published on April 5, 2011 in the
findings from its audits of the budget execution
report for the FY 2008/09 after approval by the
                                             Paxaxon key findings from the audit report on
National Assembly.                           the budget execution for FY2008/09 approved
                                             by the National Assembly.
                                             This action promoted transparency in the
                                             Government’s public financial reporting and
                                             assist in developing a better understanding of
                                             the SAO’s role, particularly its independent
                                             oversight of the Government’s financial
                                             management and reporting. The completion of
                                             this policy action together with the publication

                                             Although weaknesses remain in the current
                                             Health Management Information System,
                                             significant progress was made to strengthen
                                             reporting, consolidation, and analysis of data.
                                             Reporting formats are now consistent
                                             nationally, and the timeliness of submission of
                                             data by districts and provinces has improved
                                             steadily.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation (for DPL only)

•       The government stronger ownership of the reform program has benefited the
implementation of the second series. PRSO has served the government objective of
greater inter-agencies coordination to push forward complex cross-cutting reforms. This
principle was demonstrated in the two PRSO series and their successful implementation.
The government commitment is clearly established in the NSEDP and the strategy for
poverty reduction, as well as in the well functioning PRSO institutional arrangements.



                                               15
•       Implementation and Outcome.           The two PRSO series focused on the
establishment of legal, regulatory and strategic pillars of reforms as prerequisites for
sustainable and lasting changes. Implementation has sometimes not materialized as fast
as initially envisaged for a number of reasons, the main one being that it takes time for
legal changes to translate to on-the-ground changes and results. The future PRSO series
will need to pay attention to the design and modality for actual implementation for results
and outcomes following the establishment of regulatory framework and strategic
objectives.
•       Implementation is fostered by supporting technical assistance. Implementation
progress has been more successful in areas where technical assistance was aligned with
policy dialogue, including where technical assistance was provided by a development
partners outside the PRSO process. In such case, close dialogue ensured coordination of
reform dialogue and progress between the various parties.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

The PRSO series was monitored based on the Program Matrix updated on an annual basis
to record and reflect progress for the actions agreed, to assess the macroeconomic
developments and the progress in implementing the National Growth and Poverty
Eradication Strategy (NGPES) and its accompanying National Socio-Economic
Development Program (NSEDP). The PRSO series also established a comprehensive set
of outcome indicators to help monitor the progress in implementing these actions.

The M&E process has sometime been hindered by the general lack of reliable and timely
data in the Lao PDR. This has been recognized in the first PRSO series. The second
PRSO series has made special efforts in aligning the data needs with AAA work to help
with the M&E for actions to be implemented in the series (including Investment Climate
Assessments, PEFA, Doing Business etc.)

M&E activities have also been conducted regularly with ongoing dialogue and
supervision missions jointly organized with development partners and active cooperation
and assistance from the government.

The results framework has been designed with the dual objective of staying focused
while showing meaningful results that can be related to PRSO. Outcome indicators have
been selected to reflect the influence that the PRSO actions had on those indicators, while
being also linked to higher level development outcomes. For example, the PEFA and
Doing Business indicators have been used to measure respectively public sector
performance and the outcome of the private sector and trade actions, while non
performing loans, loan concentration, SOE losses have been used to measure the state-
owned sector performance. In the social sector the share of recurrent financing in the
sector in total recurrent funding has been used, to reflect the performance of Government
social sector finance, since recurrent funding in the social sector is one of the lowest in
the region and given the focus of the PRSO second series on the financing of the health
and education sectors. Another indicator is the number of provinces which report to the
health and education information system, highlighting the successful support of PRSO



                                            16
and other instruments to more transparent and better quality of monitoring in those
sectors.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):


Following on Government request, the Bank has designed a third PRSO series with
development partners and the government. The first of such operation, PRSO 8, has been
approved by the World Bank Board on August 9, 2012. The third series consists of four
annual operations, PRSO 8 to PRSO 11, up to FY 2015. Financing of each operation is
planned at $20 million. The third PRSO series supports policies and institutional reforms
for the sustainable management of revenues from the natural resource sectors to enable
the country to translate these revenues into development outcomes and improved public
service delivery. The new PRSO series has been prepared in parallel with the new World
Bank Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), and incorporate the lessons learned from
previous operations. The proposed five pillars in PRSO support the new CPS as a whole
(three key objectives and one cross-cutting theme). The cross-cutting theme - Strong
Public Sector Management – recognizes that institutional capacity in the public sector is a
cross-cutting challenge in Lao PDR, limiting the government’s ability to design and
implement its programs. Therefore, the achievement of each of the strategic objectives
will require some strengthening of public sector management, which makes this the core
and unifying CPS theme.
The first objective - Competitiveness and Connectivity - focuses on using investment and
analytical services to support diversification of trade and private sector development and
a competitive and efficient regulatory framework for the private sector. The second
objective - Sustainable Natural Resource Management – proposes to strengthen
governance and management of the hydropower and mining sectors. Finally, the third
objective - Inclusive Development - supports increased utilization and quality of essential
maternal and child health services.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

Consistency with Government Priorities. The focus of the second PRSO series (PRSOs 4
to 7) was highly relevant to the country priorities. The development objectives of the
second PRSO series were established in close coordination with the government and its
reform strategy as articulated in the NGPES and with implementation outlined in the
NSEDP. This series was aligned with the World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy in
2005 and its progress report in 2007, and the strategic priorities of the development
partners. Based on the two national strategic documents, the PRSO supported the two
main areas of development in the (i) sustaining growth through improvement of the
investment climate, facilitating trade and management of natural resources; and (ii)
improving social outcomes through better public financial management system and
service delivery. The PRSO series also supported the Lao PDR’s priorities in the



                                                17
external sphere, namely the government’s actions towards regional and global integration
through WTO accession and reduction of trade barriers to encourage trade with its
neighboring economies and the international market.

Program Design: The PRSO series was designed to reflect the lessons learned from the
first 3 operations (PRSOs 1 to 3). Building on the first series’ achievements, the second
series sought to deepen structural reforms on public financial management, and to expand
the support to reforms which would further benefit the country’s investment climate and
business development. The Bank’s strong program of analytical and advisory work
(AAA) served as an effective design foundation for the second PRSO series, supported
and complemented the second PRSO series. This strong AAA support ensured and
enable the consistency and relevancy of the program design for the second PRSO series,
which was translated in its successful completion.

Complementarity with other Bank Programs: The second PRSO series provided an
effective umbrella vehicle to facilitate policy dialogues between the Bank and the
government in a number of sectors. Through this established channel of communications,
the PRSO enhanced the complementarity with other Bank’s projects and programs, in the
social sectors, public resources management, hydroelectric and mining sectors.

Donor Harmonization: The second PRSO series served as a valuable instrument and
effective forum for donor harmonization in the provision of assistance to the Lao PDR
(among PRSO development partners providing parallel financing such as Ausaid, the EU,
Japan/JICA and other development partners such as the UN agencies, AsDB, and
bilateral development partners providing technical assistance in areas of interest).
Development partners’ involvement in developing and implementing the second series
has been strong. The EU, Japan, and AusAID worked closely with the Bank to establish
multi-donor trust funds to provide grant-based TA for public sector management and
trade related reforms spearheaded by the government.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between policy actions supported by operations and
outcomes)

The government implemented the PRSO in close consultation with the Bank to ensure
objectives remained appropriate and with built-in flexibility to allow for revisions and
adjustments in the actions to meet and reflect the conditions and the development
dynamics on the ground. Further, the PRSO series supported the country’s regional and
global integration as a means to achieve broad-based growth and alleviate poverty,
including the assistance to the government to make progress towards WTO accession and
reduce trade barriers.

Sustaining growth through improvement of the investment climate, facilitating trade and
enhancing management of natural resources

The second PRSO series contributed to improve the overall business climate
regulatory and strategic framework, by bringing to the government’s attention and


                                               18
underscoring the importance of such reforms. It has focused on the development of a
legal framework for investment and private business activity. The second PRSO series
supported the formulation and implementation of the Enterprise and Investment Laws.
The Enterprise Law, supported by PRSO 4 and PRSO 5, successfully introduced
simplified enterprise registration procedures. The Investment Law, supported by PRSO 6
and PRSO 7, abolishes lengthy and cumbersome licensing procedures for both domestic
and foreign investors seeking to make investment, which shorten considerable the time
requirements compared to a previous 3-to-5-month wait for government’s approval. The
Investment Law also has leveled the playing field between foreign and domestic investors
by harmonizing the investment incentives regime.
The outcomes with direct PRSO 4-7 influence are the simplification of regulations for
business entry, with the decline in the number of days to start a business from 163 in
2006 to 92 in 2012 (Doing Business) following the full implementation of the Investment
Law.

It aimed to put in place more open trade policies so that the country can benefit
from efficient integration with economies, regionally and internationally. The series
supported government efforts to reduce trade barriers and implement international and
regional trade agreements. It supported reforms in trade facilitation legislation and
procedures in order to streamline cross-border trade, to introduce a more transparent
rules-based system compliant with the WTO principles and thereby to create incentive to
increase private sector investment. The specific reforms included (i) developing relevant
implementing regulations and guidelines of the Customs Law; (ii) developing and
implementing a national trade facilitation action plan to promote simplification,
harmonization, transparency and automation in border procedures; (iii) implementing
customs modernization through the adoption of a new single administrative document
and streamlining customs procedures; and (iv) bringing the Lao legal framework for trade
in line with the principles of the WTO requirements.
The resulting outcomes from the above support include cross border streamlining of
procedures through a decline in the numbers of days for exports and imports to pass
through border clearance (from respectively 66 and 78 to 26 and 26) and a reduction of
the number of document required to export and import (respectively 12 and 16
documents in 2006 down to 9 and 10 in 2012).

This component had also placed an increased emphasis on natural resource
management, as a key element of the regulatory environment for a majority of the
current investments occurring throughout the country. In the resource sector, the
second PRSO series supported the development of a regulatory framework which aims to
attract and invite quality and responsible investments: (i) implementation of the Minerals
Law, which addresses some of the key issues facing the industry, including introduction
of more transparency and predictability in granting exploration and mining licenses to
investors, clearer regulations regarding operations, transfer of mining rights and
clarification of government’s equity rights in mining projects; (ii) update and
implementation of the National Policy on Environmental and Social Sustainability of the
Hydropower Sector (NPSH), which supports the strengthening of environmental and




                                           19
social impact assessment process through the issuing of Prime Minister Decree No. 112
on February 16 2010 as well as public disclosure of implementation reports.

PRSO 4-7 have contributed to improve the SOE restructuring and performance
monitoring. It assisted the government’s effort in developing and implementing a
strategic plan for SOE reforms, including (i) restructuring and corporatization; (ii)
establishment of a system that would eliminate future electricity payments arrears
between government agencies and the state-owned electricity enterprises (EDL),
including compliance with a Power Sector Action Plan, allowing the full elimination of
major arrears due to EDL over the years.
Outcomes which PRSO4-7 has influenced are greater transparency and commercial
viability of major SOEs being restructured, and to reduce their financial losses as
indicated by the reduction of losses in the result framework (annex 2) and with
government electricity payment arrears fully eliminated by the end of the series.

Lastly, PRSO4-7 series has sought to improve the depth and outreach of the
financial sector by: (i) taking an integrated approach to financial sector reform through
developing and implementing comprehensive financial sector strategy; (ii) enhancing
banking supervision and regulation by strengthening SOCBs supervision, which account
for 60 percent of total banking sector assets; and (iii) developing sustainable
microfinance regulatory and institutional framework.
Outcomes which can be attributed to the PRSO series are a better performing banking
sector, with declining non-performing loans, and a transparent strategic framework ready
for implementation. Improvements in the regulation and governance of the financial
sector eventually contributes to the soundness of the financial sector and reduce fiscal
risks, such as with further recapitalizations of state-owned commercial banks.

Overall, while reforms have shown good progress and improved the environment
for investment, trade and doing business, a number of challenges have remained.
Changes in laws and regulations take time to translate into on-the-ground results, and
implementation is only starting in many of the supported areas of trade and investment
climate. Some reforms in the natural resource management area will, if implemented
thoroughly, slow down and increase costs of investment, in the interests of improving
social and environmental sustainability. Challenges however remain in the appropriate
implementation of the legal framework, notably the screening and implementation of
hydropower projects according to environmentally and socially adequate criteria. Also,
PRSO support to SOE and financial sector reform has proven challenging for a number of
reasons. While SOE reforms have progressed well in the past, reforms in the state-owned
sector has shown slow progress and has not gone very further than the strategic
framework, perhaps because major privatizations and restructuration have already taken
place and the state-owned sector is relatively limited in the country. In the financial
sector, implementation if the action plan of the financial sector strategy has shown slow
progress. Nevertheless, PRSO has succeeded in maintaining a policy dialogue by
working in partnership with the ADB which has been the main donor in the financial
sector.

Strengthening PFM to improve service delivery

The second pillar of the second series -- Improving social outcomes through better public
financial management systems and service delivery - has focused on building a functional
public finance management system with: effective controls over revenues and
expenditures; a clearer delineation of powers, responsibilities and resourcing of central
and local levels of the administration; budgetary processes that enable spending plans to
be aligned with strategies, and control systems to ensure that resources are used in
accordance with those plans; and external oversight mechanisms to ensure greater
accountability to the people. The component also focused on ways to improve spending
in health and education. Support for public finance management reform has helped
develop stronger policy control over the use of budgetary resources: both in terms of
making sure that revenues are spent according to policies and plans, and that plans and
policies better determine how revenues are allocated to priority areas. Improvements in
budget processes and oversight functions have enhanced the transparency and
accountability of the public finance system, which are prerequisites for better use of
Government resources.

With the institutional infrastructure in place, the government is in a position to provide
reports on budget execution on a real-time basis. Preparatory work for the clarification of
central-local government relations, including revenue-sharing and expenditure
assignments, and service delivery has taken place and has positioned the government in a
solid technical position to make informed decisions on how to move forward with its
reforms. Budget oversight has been substantially strengthened through PRSO support to
the SAO to enhance its institutional capacity as mandated by the National Assembly and
related legislations. A plan of action for capacity building is being implemented as the
first budget audit was debated publicly and its summary published in the official media.
Debt management has been strengthened, with the installation of a debt recording system,
the publication of a first debt bulletin, and a position paper delineating the strategic
elements of a debt management strategy. These efforts will make it possible to improve
the allocation (level and composition) of social sector spending, needed to deliver key
MDGs. Momentarily, sectoral ministries lack the tools to ensure that education and health
spending is well targeted, or at levels consistent with sector development plans.

This pillar has achieved the ambitious objective of establishing the central government’s
oversight of public resources by consolidating the National Treasury, tax and custom
functions at the central level and transferring the control of bank accounts from ministries
and provinces to MOF within a Single Account Framework. It expanded budget
coverage by consolidating spending unit accounts and technical revenues, introduced in
tandem extensive changes in roles, authorities and responsibilities of different levels of
government. Budget reporting has made substantial progress: an upgraded Government
Financial Information System (GFIS) was implemented and functional since October
2009, with a new chart of accounts and centralized system architecture.

The outcomes which the PRSO series have brought about include enhanced
comprehensiveness, credibility, and timeliness of budget coverage and reporting,



                                            21
predictability in budget execution, and scope, nature and follow-up of external audit, as
measured by the consistent and sustained progress in the PEFA indicators chosen to
monitor results in the PFM reforms. At the time of the ICR, all PEFA indicators had met
their planned target.

However, key issues in PFM such as procurement have not shown as much progress as
initially envisaged with little traction found on the government side vis-a-vis the PRSO
engagement. The team is revisiting its approach to procurement reform, taking the
political economy into account and considering other instrument than PRSO to re-engage.
While budget reporting has shown improvements, progress has been slower than
expected and reporting of public finances accounts remain a challenge.

PRSO has contributed to improved service delivery, by supporting the government effort
to (i) design a strategic framework for civil service reform which has been put in
implementation; (ii) strategically prioritize resource allocations in the education and
health sectors; (iii) extend the comprehensiveness and reliability of education and health
information for use in the planning process. The outcomes under the PRSO series
include increased comprehensiveness of statistical reporting in the social sectors, and a
technically informed debate on options and challenges to enhance budgeting mechanisms
and financing priorities in the social sectors.

The outcomes which the PRSO series have brought about in service delivery include
improved reporting in the health and education sector, with 100 percent of provinces now
report information into the Education Monitoring and Information System (EMIS) and 90
percent in fiscal year 2011/12 report into the Health Monitoring Information System
(HRMIS). Other results are the increases, albeit modest, in the shares of recurrent
spending for health and education and budget norms are now being piloted, as a result of
the dialogue supported by the PRSO vehicle. Importantly, the government has
incorporated in its current national strategy specific and ambitious objectives of increased
spending in the social sectors (respectively 9 and 16 percent of total domestic public
spending should go to health and education by 2015). Finally, and partly as a result of
PRSO dialogue, the Government is now implementing new initiatives in health and
education to provide more recurrent funding at the service delivery level (respectively the
Free Maternal and Child Health Policy and School Block Grants)-.

PRSO is rated overall Satisfactory because PRSOs’ objectives, design, implementation,
and outcomes (described in the section 3.2 above) were relevant to country circumstances
and development priorities in alignment with the Government’s own development
strategies as articulated in its National Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy and the 5-
year NSEDP and were consistent with Bank strategies and goals. As a prerequisite for
any budget-support operation, the adequacy of the macroeconomic policy framework has
been successfully sustained over the PRSO implementation period. Moreover, PRSO
proved to be an effective instrument to (i) convey difficult messages at a time when
quasi-fiscal lending of the central bank could have threatened macroeconomic stability,
with government taking corrective action shortly after as a response to raised concerns;
(ii) to channel additional financing the midst of the Global Financial Crisis to help sustain
reform momentum at a time of macroeconomic uncertainty and financing shortfall,
through the IDA pilot crisis window (PRSO6).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Given sparsely populated geography, providing access to infrastructure, services and
markets for remote small villages remains as a challenge. While overall poverty
incidence fell dramatically, income disparities have increased in some instances recently
with some population groups in remote areas lagging behind. GoL in its new five year
plan aims to target these poor and "hard to reach" population groups in providing services
and access to infrastructure. According to the national poverty line, poverty fell from 39.1
percent in 1998 to 33.5 percent in 2003 and to 27.6 percent in 2008. Substantial
improvements in access to social services and infrastructure over the most recent period
have played an important role in reducing consumption poverty and increasing welfare.
Improvements in access to roads, clean water and sanitation are particularly impressive.
Education opportunities have expanded, and more than eight in ten children between the
ages of six and ten are enrolled in primary school. In addition, a swift expansion in
ownership of assets has occurred, including motorbikes and mobile phones, even in the
most remote areas. This is increasingly linking previously remote communities to
infrastructure and information. Improvements in social indicators have contributed to
reduce the gender gap through, even though many challenges remain such as maternal
health and girl education in remote areas. Improvements include increased coverage of
antenatal care, an increased number of births attended by skilled medical staff, and
improved school enrollment rates of girls. Women’s labor force participation in Lao PDR
(73%) is among the highest in the region. The successful implementation of the two
PRSO series has contributed to impressive poverty reduction over the past decade
through the effects of a stable macroeconomic framework and policies enabling the
government efforts to reduce poverty.




                                             23
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

The PRSO series has contributed substantially to institutional strengthening for MOF,
SAO, BOL and other related ministries and agencies. Specifically, the MOF benefits
from: an improved GFIS; stronger external debt management; stronger revenue
management through treasury; enhanced transparency. SAO has developed its auditing
capabilities with more transparency and accountability in public accounts. The PRSO
series also provided support and input to the BOL in its responsibility for monitoring and
supervision of the banking and financial sector. A National Trade Facilitation Committee
was established to coordinate the implementation of the National Trade and Transport
Facilitation Strategy. A Committee headed by MOF Vice-Minister was created to
sustainably address electricity payment between government agencies and EDL. More
broadly, PRSO is recognized as an effective coordination mechanism for delivering
cross-cutting reforms between government agencies and between development partners.
These institutional strengthening activities have set the stage for further long-term
development activities for the government in pursuit of its extensive and on-going reform
program.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The series also had a number of positive impacts that were not initially foreseen:

First the macroeconomic policy framework was brought at the forefront of the policy
dialogue and PRSO was an effective instrument to convey that difficult and complex
dialogue. During PRSO5, the government had met all the triggers but macroeconomic
sustainability was threatened by quasi-fiscal activities on the rise through Bank of Lao
PDR (BOL), the country central bank, direct lending as well as running down reserves.
The World Bank management and team decided to hold off negotiations until the
authorities provided assurance that these activities/practices at BOL would be phased out
and direct lending would be brought on budget. The team sought this commitment
through the Letter of Development Policy (LDP). It took some time for Government to
get back to the World Bank team with the appropriate LDP. Nevertheless, the Ministry of
Finance said that having the LDP commitment had required very high level discussions
in government on this matter. It resulted in securing the political commitment that led to
the scale-back of quasi-fiscal activities and thereby restoring confidence in the
macroeconomic policy framework adequacy for the budget-support operation to proceed.

Second, PRSO was able to effectively facilitate cross-ministerial dialogue on important
reforms such as social sector spending between ministries for finance, education and
health which paved the way for effective implementation during the third series.

Third, PRSO had a reinforcing impact on reform momentum being able to flexibly adapt
and focus on reforms with stronger political buy-in (investment and trade climate,
treasury reforms) while continuing the dialogue on more difficult ones (e.g. reforms of
procurement, SOEs, budget norms), thereby building trust and credibility between PRSO
partners.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Ratings: [Moderate]

The ICR rates the risk to development outcome as moderate, taking into account the
achievements from the second series which builds on the accomplishment of the first
series and these now serve as a solid foundation for the third series.

At the preparation of the ICR, the progress toward achieving the development outcomes
is expected to be sustained. The government has maintained its commitment to the
ensure development outcomes stay on track and remained engaged to build on existing
reforms and to proceed with the next and third PRSO series for which the first one PRSO
8 is being prepared.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)

Ratings:
Overall Rating: Satisfactory
PRSO-4: Satisfactory; PRSO-5:        Satisfactory;   PRSO-6:    Satisfactory;   PRSO-7:
Satisfactory

The Bank’s overall performance in ensuring quality at entry was Satisfactory because :
(1) the Bank's strong program of AAA at the time of the preparation of second PRSO
series made critical and timely contributions to design of the reform program, (2) the
Bank team ensured the strong ownership of the GoL by empowering the Steering
Committee and orchestrating other development partners' support for the common reform
program, and (3) the Bank team had a good mix of technical experts in the country on
key reform areas to ensure complementarity between the PRSO and investment projects.

When the second series was under consideration, the government had already established
a track record of reforms in key areas. It completed successfully the first PRSO series
which addressed a wide range of policy reforms and confirmed the authorities’
commitment to a comprehensive structural reform agenda articulated in the National
Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006-10 (NSEDP) in 2006. The Bank’s strong
program of analytical and advisory work (AAA) – completed and on-going at the onset of
the second PRSO series -- supported and complemented the PRSO work as well as the
Bank’s other technical assistance activities in Lao PDR. AAA activities at the beginning
of the second PRSO series included a series of studies, assessments and reviews, i.e.,
Country Procurement Assessment Review (2002), Poverty-Environment Nexus Study
(2002), Country Financial Accountability Assessment (2002), Public Expenditure Review


                                          25
(PER - 2002), the Budget Law Implementation Plan (2007), the first Public Expenditure
Tracking Survey (PETS, 2007), Public Expenditure Review and Integrated Fiduciary
Assessment (PER-IFA 2007), Lao Financial Sector Study (2006), Country Economic
Memorandum (2004), the Lao Poverty Assessment, PSIA; the Diagnostic Trade
Integration Study (DTIS); and an Investment Climate Assessment (ICA). As noted in the
Program Document for PRSO-4, the strategy underpinning the Bank’s AAA program was
to identify and fill key knowledge-gaps with an emphasis on joint work with the
government and other development agencies to bring about a buy-in on the diagnosis
from all stakeholders. The results of this AAA process were used to build consensus on
policy reform, sector investments, and harmonization of donor assistance in key areas.
These are reflected in the NSEDP as well as its implementation. Several of these studies
have been prepared in collaboration with other donors including the IMF, ADB, UN, and
EC, as well as other agencies. These inputs have served as a solid foundation on which
the second PRSO series was built and strengthened the fruitful dialogue with the
government and development partners in order to prepare and implement the second
PRSO series.

In addition, the PRSO program has been designed to play a focal role in supporting the
policy reform dimensions of other Bank operations, both ongoing and as envisaged in the
CAS, and is in turn to be supported by other Bank operations. The PRSO framework has
provided a platform for policy reforms that complement interventions within other
sectoral investment operations. Inter alia, this means that PRSO supported key policy
reforms that are then implemented with support from other Bank operations. Over time, a
satisfactory policy-based operation provides IDA with convincing evidence that the
country’s policies and institutions are improving and thus allowed more resources to be
made available for both sectoral investment operations and budget support.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)

[Ratings: Overall: Satisfactory
PRSO-4: Satisfactory; PRSO-5:        Satisfactory;   PRSO-6:    Satisfactory;   PRSO-7:
Satisfactory]

The quality of supervision is rated Satisfactory because: (1) the strong ownership and
relationship developed over time with the Government, (2) analytical work supporting the
monitoring of implementation. (3) a strong in-country presence including strong
complementarity of existing investment and technical assistance operations with the
PRSO dialogue and (4) enhanced harmonization with donors.

The PRSO series is built upon an effective dialogue and close relationship between the
Bank and the government, with the active participation of the development partners. The
strong relationship with the government and an effective engagement of the Bank enables
the program supported by the PRSO series to stay the course on the reform agenda and
ensures the close attention of the leadership when necessary to address any challenges
and bottlenecks.



                                          26
The Bank’s supervision activities were enhanced by existing and ongoing AAA work
which assisted in the monitoring and assessment of progress and achievements of the
actions under the PRSOs. The TTLs for the series were the country economists located
in Vientiane (PRSO4, PRSO5 and PRSO7) and the public sector coordinator in Bangkok
(PRSO6), allowing close and direct monitoring of the implementation, including
troubleshooting and forming a close working relationship with the ministries and
agencies concerned. Their presence also helped maintain a continuing policy dialogue
with the senior management as well as technical staff in the ministries and agencies,
facilitating and enhancing the quality of collaboration and cooperation,

Strong synergy between the PRSO policy and institutional reform dialogue and existing
investment and technical assistance projects in place has ensured that these would
mutually reinforce dialogue and expected outcomes (Box 1).

Box 1: Complementarity between PRSO and accompanying operations in sectors

PRSOs have been a critical element of the Bank’s support for NT2. The PRSOs support the
implementation of development policies, and national programs for poverty reduction and social and
environmental protection, as referenced in the first element of the NT2 decision framework. The links to
NT2 entail a high degree of scrutiny of the reform program, including the PRSO program, through annual
consultations with NT2 partners, the International Advisory Group and ultimately through dissemination of
information to the donor community and the wider public. PRSO has also supported stronger PFM systems
supporting the implementation of the NT2 revenues management arrangements to provide additional
resources in support of poverty reduction and environmental protection programs selected according to an
agreed set of eligibility criteria.
PRSO has been closely complementary to the government’s program for improvement in public
expenditure management, as laid out in its Public Finance Management Strengthening Program
(PFMSP). The PFMSP has been supported by (i) the multi-donor trust fund established by AusAID, the
EC, SIDA, and SDC and managed by the World Bank. This MDTF is an important vehicle for
providing untied additional resources to the Government for implementation of the Public Financial
Management System Project (PFMSP), including support for implementation of the new Budget Law. The
MDTF also improves donor coordination and harmonization; (ii) the Financial Management Capacity
Building Project (FMCBP) is designed to finance technical assistance and capacity building needs to
support the implementation of the Government’s structural reform programs in public financial
management, SOCB reform, SOE reform and enterprise development. FMCBP has already been used to
finance various PRSO-related activities, including independent audits of SOEs and SOCBs under PRSO1-
4; provision of TA for revising the chart of accounts and realigning the budget nomenclature, training of
staff, procurement of hardware to improve management of state assets, and the recruitment of technical
assistance under the PEMSP. The FMCBP is supporting capacity strengthening at the SAO, in close
coordination with on-going TA from ADB.
The Trade Development Facility MDTF and the Lao Customs and Trade Facilitation Project
(LCTFP) both contribute to improving trade competitiveness and have supported the PRSO
dialogue. The customs project aims to facilitate trade by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of
customs administration. This is achieved by simplifying customs procedures, eliminating duplication and
redundancy, reducing transaction costs and time to clear goods, and increasing transparency and
accountability. The project is built on the results of AAA work including the DTIS and ICA and supports
the reform agenda to sustain fast export-driven growth in the medium- and long- term. The Trade
Development Facility MDTF managed by the World Bank, with contributions from EC and Australia, is
also supporting this program and provides technical assistance to improve competitiveness, business
environment, standards, information technology for border operations and inter-agency coordination, and
implementation support for a sector-wide approach in trade. Major reforms in trade facilitation and other
trade-related areas are supported through the PRSO program, Component 1.
The Technical Assistance for Capacity Development in Hydropower and Mining Sector



                                                   27
Project provides a platform to increase human capacity and improve the performance of the
Government oversight institutions for the two sectors. It aims at building critically needed capacity and
generating public awareness across the hydropower and mining sectors. The provision of adequate skills
and training to government staff and the next generation of leaders for the two sectors would remove
critical bottlenecks to the development of both sectors. The hydropower component focuses on capacity
building in support of sustainable hydropower development in Lao PDR. Activities cover the entire value
chain, from planning, concessioning, construction, and operation to revenue management, including
facilitating the implementation of the National Policy on Sustainability of the Hydropower Sector (NPSH).
The mining component supports: (i) completion and dissemination of the new mining legislation; (ii)
development of a national mining development policy; (iii) preparation of a standard mineral development
agreement; and (iv) promotion of models for corporate social responsibility, risk mitigation and community
benefit-sharing approaches.
The Lao Environmental and Social Project is supporting the development of the regulatory
framework for the hydropower sector, and in relation to other large development projects. Sub-grants to
support implementation of the National Policy on the Environmental and Social Sustainability of the
Hydropower Sector, including the strengthening of Environment and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA)
Practice and new ESIA regulation in Lao PDR.

Greater donor involvement and harmonization of resources among donors during
implementation enhance the supervision of the series. Enhanced communications with
the donor community and development partners facilitated the reduction of overlapping
and inconsistencies among donors and their development programs and PRSO objectives.
These efforts resulted in greater involvement of donors providing parallel funding and
joint technical assistance, in particular through 2 multi-donor trust funds, under the PRSO
umbrella.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Ratings: Overall: Satisfactory
PRSO-4: Satisfactory; PRSO-5:                Satisfactory;     PRSO-6:       Satisfactory;     PRSO-7:
Satisfactory

Overall Bank performance is rated Satisfactory because: (1) the quality at entry is
Satisfactory and (2) the supervision is Satisfactory. Government’s interest in PRSO is
strong, as illustrated by its request and strong engagement for at third series of PRSO.

5.2 Borrower Performance

Note: According to the ICCR Guidelines, if Government and the implementing agency
are indistinguishable, particularly for DPL operations, a rating and justification is
provided only for Overall Borrower Performance.

Ratings: Overall: Satisfactory
PRSO-4: Satisfactory; PRSO-5: Satisfactory; PRSO-6: Satisfactory; PRSO-7:
Satisfactory

Government’s overall performance was Satisfactory for PRSO-4 to 7, on the basis of the
completion of all triggers, the achievement of a satisfactory end-of-series outcome rating
and its commitment and ownership of PRSO supported reforms. Indeed, Government has



                                                   28
gained experience over the first and second series of PRSOs institutional coordination,
setting realistic yet stretching targets, and leveraging PRSO cross-cutting dialogue to
achieve complex reforms.

The commitment which government had gradually built during the PRSO first series has
further deepened during the second PRSO series, thereby transforming what was initially
perceived as a challenging and risky operation into a mature and solid dialogue. PRSO
has benefitted from strong ownership of the government of Lao PDR. It has provided a
platform of reform dialogue between 14+ government agencies, represented in the PRSO
steering committee, spearheaded by the Ministry of Finance

The government was able to use PRSO as a solid platform for coordination and
cooperation between government agencies and between government and development
partners. It has translated into alignment of development partners behind the same
government reform objectives. Every year, government and development partners have
discussed progress towards common goals for reform and the stability of the
macroeconomic policy framework as a prerequisite for budget-support operations. The
strong coordination has resulted into predictable disbursements of PRSO budget-support
every year, in alignment with the budget cycle. It has been used as a tool both for
government and for development partners for alignment and monitoring of performance.

The MOF leadership in chairing the PRSO steering committee has strengthened over time
and has been paramount in facilitating the achievements of PRSO-supported reforms. The
PRSO secretariat continued to play a critical role in coordinating day-to-day coordination
and cooperation between ministries, and with PRSO development partners. Performance
of line ministries has been good, with an improved understanding of the PRSO
instrument, including with the BOL where the reform dialogue has always been a
challenge.

6. Lessons Learned
(both operation-specific and of wide general application)

The government and development partners’ teams reviewed at length the lessons learned
following the conclusion of the second programmatic series of PRSOs 4 to 7 during a
retreat in Vang-Vieng, Vientiane Province, on March 31st-April 1st, 2011. These lessons
learned along the way during the first and second series implementation may be
highlighted as follows:

•        PRSO has served as an effective vehicle for policy reform dialogue and aid
coordination among relevant government ministries and agencies, between the
government and development partners, and between development partners. This
mechanism provided higher visibility to sector reforms and greater coherence of the cross
sectoral reform agenda as well as direct attention from the government senior leadership.
The effectiveness was strengthened during the second series by greater focus, putting in
place AAA and TA supportive of reforms so to alleviate capacity constraints, aligning
priorities with development objectives, allowing flexibility in the instrument to achieve



                                               29
outcomes even though those were not initially envisioned, thereby recognizing and
internalizing the changing nature of economic reform sequencing.

•       Selecting of focused sector engagement where PRSO work has clear comparative
advantage. One of the lessons of the past two series is that the progress in the social
sector associated with PRSO support was realized with high transactions costs, and
whose value added or comparative advantage relative to other instruments such as TA or
programmatic approach such as FTI has not been well defined. It will be important to
strategically select the modalities of engagement in the social sectors to ensure that PRSO
value added as an instrument of policy dialogue is maximized for results.

•       Complementarity between policy and institutional dialogue through PRSO and
existing investment and technical assistance projects is critical for the success of reforms.
In order to assist in effective implementation of the policy reforms, complementary
technical assistance have been provided through projects and coordinated technical
support by other development partners.

•      Adapting to the political economy of reforms, identifying champions in
government with a reasonably well-defined reform agenda and engaging with a broader
range of actors. Opening the dialogue and flexibly adapting to the political economy for
reforms will be critical for success. These include local governments such as provinces
and the National Assembly economic and budget Committee. Supporting a reasonably
well defined reform agenda of a senior champion in Government is equally important for
success.

•       Sequencing reforms and PRSO intervention. The second series has set ambitious
targets on a number of parallel fronts which were suitable for the so-called first
generation reforms, concentrated in securing control over resources and budget execution.
The 3rd PRSO series would need to pay more attention to what strategic sequencing
would be appropriate for the country’s existing institutional capacity and political reality,
balancing far reaching reforms with “low-hanging fruits? so as to support and nurture the
overall reform momentum. It will be important to sequence PRSO interventions by
balancing with the understanding of issues and options for reforms.

•      Coordinating with Sector Working Groups and other development partner
support. In areas where sector working groups are active, it is important that PRSO
engage in and maintain direct communications with existing sector working groups to
ensure a constructive and consistency to the existing reform dialogue. It is equally
important that PRSO coordinates closely and maintain contact with other development
partners who do not participate in the PRSO modality but are involved in areas relevant
to PRSO dialogue.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

Lessons learned were discussed by the GOL, the Bank and the participating development
partners at 2 stakeholder events (PRSO Vang-Vieng retreat on March 31th-April 1st 2011
and PRSO outreach presentation in Vientiane on November 18 2011). The GOL team
expressed the following views:

The Government expressed the following views on the lessons learned. PRSO is seen
as an effective instrument of policy coordination and support. In particular, PRSO:

   •   Provides a platform for coordination, consultation and dialogues among GOL and
       donors in order to shape reform programs, which are consistent of the NSEDP;
   •   Encourages GOL's ownership and accountability;
   •   builds capacity of the GOL;
   •   Increases aid effectiveness and helps finance overall budget deficit;
   •   Reduces transaction costs for managing the resources;
   •   Provides a channel to mobilize resources in times of the global financial crisis;
   •   Is supplemented by TA/support provided to sectors where needed.

The Government expressed the following views on the reasons for success:

   •   The GOL provides regular guidance to the PRSO process, coordination, and
       content of reforms;
   •   The PRSO Steering Committee closely monitors progress;
   •   The PRSO Secretariat actively coordinates and follows up with the sectors;
   •   Sectors show their ownership in implementing policy actions in their respective
       areas;
   •   GOL receives both technical and financial assistance from donors to implement
       the program.

The Government expressed the following views on areas for improvement:

   •   The determination of triggers and policy actions should be realistic and
       considerate of existing capacity of the sectors;
   •   There is a need to allocate capable/appropriate staff to follow up/implement
       policy actions. If different staff are assigned to follow up, there is a need to ensure
       a smooth transition to avoid any delay;
   •   There is still need to further strengthen coordination among GOL agencies and
       donors;
   •   PRSO should mobilize other donors to join.



                                             31
The World Bank team welcomes the GOL feedback and expresses the following
comments:

    •   The Bank took into account the lessons from PRSO4-7 in designing the third
        programmatic series of PRSO4-7, in terms of the realism of reforms vis a vis
        capacity of the sectors;
    •   During the third series implementation, special attention is made to ensure a good
        understanding of the PRSO dialogue and respective responsibilities, when and
        where counterparts have changed. APRSO brochure in Lao has been made to
        explain the main characteristics ((coordination, reforms, institutional, process,
        results, monitoring) of PRSO.
    •   Coordination has been strengthened even further for PRSO8-11 by creating
        Technical Thematic Teams to enhance sector dialogue.
    •   New partners are encouraged to join the PRSO process on an ongoing basis and
        the World Bank team pro-actively seeks new partnerships. At the end of 2011, a
        PRSO outreach events was organized where all development partners were
        invited to participate. A PRSO brochure has been made, both in Lao and English,
        which explains the PRSO instrument.

The PRSO is the only macro-economic programme (general budget support-type) in Lao
DPR that brings together the four aid effectiveness principles. As a programmatic budget
support, the PRSO series are aimed at increasing the predictability of funding and the
associated dialogue between Government and Development Partners, to sharpen policy
prioritisation and strengthen coordination.
The objectives of the second PRSO (4-7) series were highly relevant to the country
priorities and have been successful in supporting the country’s regional and global
integration as a means to achieve broad-based growth and alleviate poverty. This
included assisting the GoL to make further progress towards WTO accession and reduce
trade barriers, to strengthen macroeconomic management, to enhance public finance
management systems and social sectors delivery. The PRSO series was particularly well
adapted to the EU CSP and MIP 2001-13 in that sense that both programmed shared
similar objectives.
The 2010 European Court of Auditor report on Commission's Management of General
Budget Support in ACP, Latin America and Asian Countries mentions Lao DPR's PRSO
series as 'best practice' for (1) the quality of the policy reform matrix which provides
'clear, detailed information on priority actions to be completed within the timeframe of
the programme' and the performance indicators that allow objective monitoring of the
achievement of the objectives of the programme and for (2) the appropriate support to
capacity development reflecting the capacity constraints of the Government. The
technical assistance objectives include facilitating sector policy dialogue between local
and international stakeholders and helping the Government to achieve the performance
indicator targets linked to the variable tranche of the GBS programme.
Complementarity between WB and EU
In addition to the PRSO Programme Action Matrix, the EU and Lead Line Ministries
(Education and Health) developed and agreed upon a series of specific conditions related
to these two sectors and framed the result matrix for the “EU Variable Tranche? (parallel
financing to the PRSO series). Both programmes were part of the same appraisal process.
The specific conditions related to Health and Education were also defined to reinforce
(without duplication) the PRSO health and Education Triggers or Policy actions.

Implementation issues
The Delegation would like to highlight the importance of carefully and systematically
crafting the programme action matrix (the set of prior and policy actions) taking into
account the institutional and technical requirements that will be imposed on the
Government to meet the agreed conditions or to properly implement the actions induced
by these prior or policy actions. Likewise, additional efforts will have to be made by the
Government to fully implement prior and policy actions agreed upon at the identification
phase. These two approaches will substantially increase the quality of the policy dialogue
framework and eventually will lead to better sector performances and policy outcomes.

General Statement
   • The Government of Japan had participated in the process of development of the
      Implementation Completion and Result Report.
   • PRSO was a useful platform to monitor the progress on institutional reforms with
      clear indicators and targeted deadlines.
   • Through participating PRSO, TA or technical cooperation projects may present
      policy options, but implementation of the policies are often affected by the
      government’s decision. The importance of close working relationship between
      DPs and the Government was noted in order for smooth implementation and
      enforcement of the policies.
   • One of the lessons learnt for the PRSO series 2 is how achievements of the each
      policy action would lead to its implementation, and consequently to the
      development effectiveness. Hence further focus on the enforcement of policies
      developed and established during this series would be desirable in the next series.
   • Further coordination and collaboration with the Round Table Process would be
      recommended in order to facilitate more constructive dialogue among the parties
      concerned, especially in the fields where the PRSO plays important roles, e.g.
      linking budget planning and sector plans, and budgeting in social sectors.

Specific Details
   • The Government of Japan has particularly assisted in SOE restructuring,
       development of Public Investment Program Law and PM Decree on Industrial
       Estate and other important government initiatives.
   • With regard to SOE restructuring, a JICA TA had assisted drafting the SOE
       restructuring plan (phase 3). In order to implement this plan, approval of this plan
       became one of the policy actions in the PRSO6. Further efforts in approving this
       plan by the concerned authorities need to be made in order to accelerate SOE
       restructuring.
   • With regard to Public Investment Program, Public Investment Law was approved
       and came into effect, and its implementation decree is under way. Public
       Investment Program manual was also developed. JICA utilized the existing
       project TA to develop these legal frameworks as well as to provide capacity
       building training to ensure the improvement of the reliability of budget planning
       and management.
