RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
FOR
COASTAL EMBANKMENT REHABILITATION PROJECT-Il
INTRODUCTION
Bangladesh is a land scarce country. She has a poptilation of 114.5 million on an area ol
144,000 squiare km. Any development programme may displace persons from their lands
involuntarily, consequenit with deleterious socio-economic and environmental impacts both
under short and Linder long rin perspectives. In the cases, therefore, where displaceimelit 
unavoidable, the projects mIust plan resettlement actions to improve, or at least restore former
living stan(iards and earning capacity of the displaces. Otherwise, thle very objectives of thc
developmnenti project remain at risk of jeopardy.
It is under this inperative that community participation in development projects, resettlemieni
and rehabilitation action, plan for investment projects involving humian displacemient,
systematic implementation of those plans etc. have been stressed in the grater- interest of
giving ouit successful development projects with sustainable socio-economic impacts.
II.    THE CERP-II: BACKGROUND AND OBTECTIVE
Bangladesh has over 700 kms. of coast line on the mainland and several off-shore islands in
the Bay of Bengal. Due to the extreme scarcity of land vis-a-vis the size of population, miuch
of this coastal belt is well populated and some areas including the islands of Sandwip,
Kutubdia and Hatiya are heavily populated, Cyclonic surges are a perennial threat to the
physical and economic life of this littoral population. During the last 125 years, over 42
cyclones hit the coastal belt; 14 occurred during the last 25 years. The devastating cyclon(e
of April, 1991 has squarely raised cyclone protection as a priority national agen(da withi
attention focussed on three major areas: (i) construction of an adequate number of cyclone
shelters, (ii) establishlmient of an appropriate cyclone disaster preparedlness programme, .miid
iii) rehabilitation and strengthening ol the system of coastal embankments.
Protection to the littoral population thus underscored, the rehabilitation of coastal polders hIas
bieenl 1elt to be tlhe priie necessily. Out of the 21 polders (Tn)le-l) hard-hit by the cyclohn
of April,j9l only 4 polders are presently being rehabilitated under Saudi Assistance, (0
polciers unider IDA credit and Assistance of Japan Govt. and the remzaininig 11 polders have
1



been proposed to be rehabilitated under IDA credit and EC grants. While the feasibility study
of the those II polders has been completed under Flood Action Plan-7 (FAP-7), the sound
socio-economic assessment of the Project Affected Persons (PAPs) losing assets to the project
dlue to land acquisition, for retired embankment (roughly 67.8 kim) and that Ofstuliaters
losing their existing habitats along the embankimients to be resecLionecl (about X8.X kiii) lhwv
also  been accomplished. A  reliable social analysis of PAPs and squatters, proplc
demographic assessment, estimates of costs etc. have been furnished and a potentially
etiective organizational patterns lor inmplementation has also been agreed uLpoul with ill tlIc
GOB.
T'he overall objectives of CERP-11, therefore, are precisely to
Restore the security of agricultural crops and homesteads against flood and salinity
To save human and livestock population of the entire littoral community being in the
polder
To maintain a balance in environment and ecology at large in the project area, along
with requisite resettlement activities for the PAPs and Squatters. The project has been
included under priority investment project of Bangladesh Water Development Board
and financial provisions have been made under the Annual Development Programme
of 1995-96 FY.
The Resettlement Action Plan under CERP-II has been conceptually divided into two parts
on the basis of nature of target population for Resettlement
(i)    Resettlemilenit for PAPs; and
(ii)    Resettiement for squatters
III.   RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN FOR PAPs
3.1    The Project
The civil works to be financed under the project consist of the following:
i     Major rehabilitation and improvemnent works on 12 sea facing embankiimenits including
(i) retirement of aboLIt 65 Km. of embankments; (ii) major resectioning of about 7(0
2



Km. of embankimient; (iii) remaining works in Anowara, financed originally under an
earlier Priority Works Program (PWP), which may not be completed by the Closing
Date for PWP financing (tentatively estimated at about 7 Km. of resectioning and 3
Kml. of new embankimient); and (iv) additional works to cope with recent erosion1 inl
soutlhern Sandwip, estimated tentatively to require about 6 Km. of adclitioniai
retirement; including replacement or repairs of associated drainage structuires.
2.    Minor rchabilitlalion an  imiprovemient works for the abovc 12 poldiers  Iio(t >
additional polders, including minor embankment repairs (mainly on the non-coastal
sections), reexcavation of drainage canals, and repairs or construction ol
regulators/surface sluices in areas not covered under 1 above.
CERP also includes afforestation and improved operation and maintenance programs,
covering the above 17 polders and 4 additional polders. These programs involve inter alia
provision of homestead sites at various locations along the inside toe of the embankment.
Socio-economic surveys (SESs) have been completed for the vast majority of.PAPs affected
by the project, namely the ten polder sections reffered to in 1 (i) above and the squatters to
be relocated due to the embankment sectionong reffered to in I (ii) above. The results are
suLmmarized in this document. (Details of the 10 polders reffer6d-to in I (i) above an(d
included in the SES are furnished in Table-II. Minor modifications in alignment have been
made subseqLuently due to erosion). Under the project, further SESs would be undertaken,
before handing over of the relevant land to contractors, to cover (a) areas where as a resull
of susequient erosion the alignments of embankments to be retired have been mo(litied since
the SES; (b) areas required alongside existing emnbankments under I (ii) above required lor
eimbankment widening and areas under one existing embankment in one polder whichl were
provi(le(d by the owners on a voluntary basis without compensation; (c) areas reqLired to be
acquire(d for un(ler I (iii), I (iv), and 2 above; and (d) areas require(d for homestead plots and
not stirveyed Lin(ler any of the above categories. The same compensation principles will bo
applied to tliese PAl's as applied to those who have been previously suirveye(.
3.2   CGoals anid ()Objectives of Ihe Resettleiciint Action Plan
The Resettleiment Action Plan (RAP) for CERP has two main goals, namely,
a.     Ensuire a fair compensationl for all persons who are directly or in(lirectly allectedl by
land acquisitioni lor the l)roject, and
3



b.     Evolve a mnodus operandi to implement resettlement activities in an effective an(l
efficient manner.
In achieving the above goals, the Resettlement Action Plan has the following specii'ic
objectives:
a.     Develop a Policy Framework by clearly defining various categories of Project
Affected Persons (PAPs) and specifying their entitlement to compensation  as
admlissible under the law and project conditionalities;
b.     Assess the socio-economic status of the PAPs prior to land acquisition which should
serve as a benchmark for future reference, and find out about the PAPs own views
on various resettlement issues;
c.     Determine the quantities of compensation in cash and kind that is payable to eaci
PAP under the acdopted policy framework; and
d.     Formulate an implemilentation strategy and organizational structure to carry out the
resettlement of PAPs.
The preparation of the RAP is based on a Socio-Economic Survey (SES) carried out on all
PAPs in the ten listed polders. In the first instance, PAPs are land-owners whose land will
be acqLiired by the project. But the definition of PAP also includes persons who may suffer
other tangible losses as a consequience of project implementation.
The scope of the Socio-Economic Survey covered the following
i.    identity of PAPs.
ii.    socio-economic status of PAPs
iii.    a comiprehensive listing of all losses suffered by PAPs.
vi.    prevailing market prices of various categories of land, and
v.     PAP views on compensation levels and preferred modalities.
3.3    BaIckgr'ouLnd to Resettlemenit Plan
The preparation of the Resettlemilent Plan is based on a socio-econiomiiic stirvey of projec!
af'f'ecte(l persons (PAPs) in the liste(d polders. Maps of the affecied poiders sshowinig thle
proposed alinmeLnts and( thleir location on the imap are appendec.

The Resettlement Action Plan presents the policy framework on compensation and(
implementation as well as time-plans and budget estimates. It also provides an overview ol
the PAP population. Detailed specification of losses and compensation packages by individtial
PAPs have been prepared. Specifically, the socio-economic data is processed into two
categories firstly, in a plot-wise information sheet and secondly, in a PAP-wise information
sheet.
The formation of the policy framework has sought to integrate the general guide-lines on
involuntary resettlement as set out in World Bank Operational Directive 4.30 with the
specificities of the Project context. In particular. attention has been paid to the policy
objectives that
a.    no project affected  person  shall be worse off than  before duIe to projeci
i mpleinentation;
b.    implementation  arrangements  on  resettlement  should  allow  for  maximLifli
transparency;
c.    operationally meaningful approaches at community participation should be actively
explored.
IV.  COMPENSATION ENTITLEMENT POLICY MATRIX
The Socio-Economic Survey has served to establish the exact range of losses which are
expected to occur due to land acquisition. In the section which follows, a policy matrix is
presented on the entitlement which are due against each category of loss. The two guiding
principles in developing the matrix have been (a) existing provisions of the law ; and (b) the
dictumil on involuntary resettlement that no one shall be worse off than before as a
consequence of acquisition.
A crucial concern pertaining to the adequacy of the compensation levels is the information
sources on land prices. Existing legal practice assesses market value by taking an averagv
over the last 12 months of the prices recorded in sale deeds maintained at the Sub-Registrar's
office (SRO). The Socio-Economic Survey (SES) generated three land price series in additiol
lo thie data avaiilablc at thle Suh-Registrar's of'ficc:
(i)   reported prices as collectedl through a com1Munity levels suirvey of key inforntllts;
(ii)   PAll expectations on thle replacement value of acquired land;
(iii) p)riccs revealed throuIgil the survey on the sale and purchase of land by PAPs.

The Entitlement Policy matrix is given in Annex-A and a cost estimate on the basis of socio-
economliic survey data is presented in appropriate section. The matrix shows that there art
categories of affected persons in the project area with diverse PAP preference lor
compensation modes as follows:
a.     Compensation by cash or cheque
b.     Land for land option; and
C.     ellficaciois process of coinpensation payinent with a supplementary provision lo
adclitional assistance.
V.    SPECIFIC ISSUES RELATED TO PAPs COMPENSATION
5.1    Dimension of Vulnerability
An important concern in land acquisition is where the proposed acquisition falls heaviest on
the land-poor households. Survey data shows that land-poor households are expected to
contribute 8% of the land to be acquired. Small owners will contribute 18%. The largest
contributions come from the middle owner group and the very large owner group 27% and
34% respectively. There are, however, considerable variation across the. polders. In general
however, it is fair to conclude that the burden of the proposed acquisition will be4distributed
across all land-groups.
From a vulnerability stand point, an additional issue to look at is what proportion of lan(d
owned by a particuilar group is being lost to acquisition. It shows that on this criterion, thc
land-poor houselolds are mnore vtilnerable. 31-39% of their ownership holdings aire expected
to be lost to acquisition. There is, however, quite a large variationi across polders wilh tht-
vulinerability of the land-poor being highest in Hatiya (52-96%) and lowest in Teknafl ( 10
19%). The proportionate burden declines as one goes up the land ownership scale.
An extreme expression of vulnerability refers to the situation wherein a PAP  will bc
rendered wholly landless due to acquisition. The total number of such cases in the saImpliv
survey have been found to be four, two in Sandwip and two in Ramgati.
5.2    Type and Incidenice of Other Losses
While acquisition impacts most strongly on land assets, the acquisition process may also
occasion othier categories of losses.
6



12% of PAPs are expected to lose homestead land though this percentage varies from a lovv
of 2%  (KLirishkul) to a high of 23%  (Patharghata). The percentage expected to lose thc
actual hoLIse is 11 % though again there is a variation here from 5 % in Hatiya to 32 % in
Matharbari .
The other major category of loss is tress. Even here, however, the number affecLed is
relatively small (16%). About 3% of PAPs are likely to lose their fish-stock due to
acquisition of ponds.
Some of the other minor loss categories are specific to certain polders. Thus, in Sandwip,
5% of PAPs are expected to lose commercial structures while in Teknaf, 6% are expected
to lose betel-leaf garden 4% of PAP households are expected to lose usufruct right on land.
65% of the PAP households are also expected to lose standing crop.
5.3    Pap Self Assessment 'f Likely Impact of Project
An important issue in the context of involuntary resettlement is the likely imnpact of tile
project on the income earning opportunities of the, persons expected to lose land diie to
acquisition. The issue here is not the overall viability of the ProjeetNas may be reflected in
the opinion of all persons resident in the catchment area but rather of those specific
households who are PAPs i.e. those who incur direct losses due to acquisition. The Socio-
Economic Survey has utilized the self-assessment by PAPs to obtain some insights on the
matter.
The self-assessment of impact has been grouped into 5 categories. For all ten polders
considered together, 51% assessed no impact, 15% assessed immediate major loss, 13%
immediate minor loss, 14% long term major loss and 7% no loss but gain. The pattern ol
self-assessmienit appears, however, to very significantly across polders. Assessment of gailn
is noticeable mainly, for Teknaf and Matharbari. Sharankhola and Hatiya assess long term
major loss while Ramgati and Hatiya also assess immediate major loss. Assessment ol
immediate major loss is noticeable mainly for Kalapara and Companigonj.
5.4    Pap Preference on Compensation Modes
The overwhelming majority (90%) has opted for monetary compensation either in cash or
by cheqLe, 3% has preferred to receive land-for-land as compensation. However, this applies
7



mainly to Teknaf(9 houiseholds) and Sarankhola (6 households). Field survey reports she(d
some additional light on this matter.
In the case of Sharankhola too, a similar consideration i.e. lack of confidence in the payment
process, appears to have been at work behind the preference for land for land option.
In the case of Teknaf, the preference for land-for-land option appears to stem from three
factors. Some of the plots to be acquired are currently subject to regular overtlow by tide utte
to earlier breaches in existing embankments. Since several years,-these plots have no
economic value as such. A few of the preferences for land-for-land option pertain to suci
plots. The other consideration refects the lack of confidence in the compensation paymeni
process.
The operational significance of the above thus does not appear to suggest physicCl1
resettleimenit as any major optioil to pursue. From  PAP point of view, the critical needl
appears to be a more "efficacious process of compensation payment with perhaps .t
supplemilentary provision for additional assistance, within specified limits, to-those wilh)
purchase new land to replace the one they have lost to acquisition.
VI. PUBLIC INFORMATION AND GRIEVANCE REDRESSAL
6.1   Information Component
Critical to the success of a RAP is a public information campaign which should ensure
transparency and provide definite spaces to PAPs for getting their views across. The SES has
already provided an opportunity to record and collate individual PAP viewpoints on the
critical range of issues pertaining to acquisition. The plan proposes three further steps in the
public information campaign
(i)    Translation of the RAP into an abridged Bangla version highlighting the entitlemenit
policy matrix. Director, Land & Revenue, will be responsible on behalf of BWI)I
to organize the translation with the assistance of consultants and make copies availabht
to all concerned within CERP for dissemination amongst PAPs.
(ii)    Arrangement of local-level infornation meeting where the text of the Bangla brochurt
will be explained publicly. The concerned SEs will instruct concernedl SDE throtigi
XEN to ask local Union Council Chairman to convene such meetings. The imeelinig
8



shoLild be chaired by concerned XEN and should have the participation of PAl s.
Unioni Chairman and Members. The meeting can also be the forim for distributio
of the Brochures if they have not already reached the PAPs.
(iii)   The target of the information campaign is not only PAPs bult also thle imiplemiienting
funictionaries at the field level. The concerns with involuntary resettlemenl are
relatively new within the administrative milieu of Bangladesh and it is important to
secure the active suipport of the two core offices i.e. those of the DC and the XEN,
to the broad objectives of RAP. With this objective in view, the concerned SEs will
convene district level workshops at the earliest with the participation of the offices
of the XEN and the DC and any necessary participation from BWDB headquarters.
The technical presentation of the RAP will be carried out by the consultants.
6.2    Monitotiiig and Grievance Redressal Component
Notwithstanding the systetn strengthening recommended thus far even in a more effective
implementation of the RAP, there is no guarantee that occasions for PAP grievances will not
arise. It is important that such grievances be monitored and redressed. PAb grievances ma)
cover the following
(i)    Disagreement or rejection of the project as a whole; this grievance is primiarily
addressed at the Project Planning Phase through the requiremeilts for publit
consultation. Residual grievances of this nature have been recorded during the SES.
(ii)   The second category of grievance pertains to alignments. The 1982 Act provides
scope to PAPs to file objections in this regard with the DC's office for sub'sequent
hearing and resolution.
(iii)   The third category of grievance pertains to the proper accounting of all categories olf
losses which PAPs may suffer due to acquisition. The practice thus far has been to
record such losses through a joint verification exercise carried out by the DC's office
in conjunction with that of the RB, in this case BWDB. The general shortfalls in this
regard  has been relatively minor ground-truthing. The commissioning  of an
independent SES has been a major departure in this regard and this has allowed
substantial ground truthing through the combined efforts of the consultants and
BWDB field staff. The information base generated throughi the SES will therefore
provide the backbone to the joint verification exercise and will have substaliually
addressed this category of grievance.

(iv)   The fourth category of grievance pertains to the size of the compensation award. The
1982 Act allow PAP who have grievance in this regard to seek arbitration tlhrougl
civil coturts.
(v)    The Fifth category of grievance pertains to the actual receipt of the compeasation both
with regard to delays and leakages.
To summaries, the 1982 Land Acquisition Act provides scope for redressal on some of the
grievance categories while grievances on the acceptability of the Project 4tself are only
redressed throtIgh public agitation. From the standpoints of system-strengthening as well as
that of redressing involuntary resettlement, what is required is to provide complementary
scopes for grievance redressal in particular in those categories where current scopes for
grievance redressal may be very important, namely, the timely and leakage free receipt of
compensation.
The critical concerns instituting grievance redressal mechanisms are the adequacy of channels
available to individual PAPs to register their grievance and the strength of the redressal
authority to ensure compliance. With these consideration in mind, the plan proposes the
following:
(i)    Ensuring that payment to the PAP is made in the presence of an observer, namely,
a representative of the Requiring Body not below the rank of SDE. Ministry of Land
issue an administrative order to this effect and inform Ministry of Water Resolurces
accordingly.
(ii)    A Grievance Redressal Committee (GRC) will have four members as follows:
(i)    A Representative of ADC (Revenue)              -      Convenor
(ii)   SDE of Implementation Agency                   -      Member Secretary.
(iii)   Local UP Chairman                             -      Member
(iv)   A Representative of the Implementing NGO       -      Member
(Concerned Programme Officer)
If necessary, the committee can co-opt. members from Section Officers (SO)
Iniplementing Agency from GOB side and a teacher of the local educational institution
on non-government side.
10



(iii)   Grievance Redressal Comlmittees will be formed at each PMRU Unit lOCatilonS wilhill
two months of the establishment of PMRU, so that prodecure can be seen by l'A Ps
to be in place. It will commence hearing within a week of issuing details of'
entitlements of PAPs following joint verification. Grievance may be brought to the
attention of Implementing NGO or PMRU office. The committees are expected to
meet to hear grievance once every two weeks for a day (information on'the place and
time will be posted in the concerned areas and PAPs informed by village level
workers). The progress of these hearing will be monitored by PMRU and if needed
frequency of meetings may be increased. The project will pay the committee mem1bers
expenses in attending hearing and in follow-up work including visifs to PAPs and
investigation of land records.
(iv)   The Ministry of Water Resources will issue an administrative order to this effect.
VII   INSTII'UTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
While an organizational Olutfit for administration of the construction activities of CERP-ll
exists, the institutional arrangement for Resettlement Plan implementation can be fitted into
that outfit for making the system  comprehensive. For that matter, the other arm  of
Resettlement in this Project i.e. the squatter resettlement, can also be.set into the said outfit
showing involvement of all the responsible agents from policy making down to fieli level
staff and target population. The organogram of CERP-II and the Project Management and
Resettlement Unit is shown in Figure-1.
The project Management and Resettlement Unit (PMRU) headed by Deputy Director
(Resettlement) at the central unit and controlled by the project Director, CERP-I11 shall have
the structure as presented in Figure-11. The central unit of Resettlement shall have 4 zonal
Resettlement units at Cox's Bazar, Chittagong, Noakhali and Barisal, each headed by one
Resettlement and public Relation officer (RPRO). Each zonal unit will be assisted by special
LAO's, Revenue officers, Accountant and Revenue Surveyor.
As for the squatter resettlement, the said PMRU shall administer the resettlement issues in
close association with the Forest Department. The Forest Department will assist. BWD13 in
embankilment afforestation and will be responsible for foreshore afforestation. Both BWDB
and FD will obtain NGO assistance in afforestation activities. NGO will assist in organizing
and monitoring of the afforestation programmes of both BWDB and FD.
11



The main tasks of the PMRU will be to
Coordinate, manage and day-to-day monitoring of resettlement
Establish local advisory and liaison committees;
*     Determine land ownership within the project land acquisition areas
Determine entitlement packages of each PAP (assisted by partner organizations)
Ensure that the records kept for CCL and for additional project related compensation
are consistent
EnsuLre all PAPs are identified and receive their entitlement with the minimum
hardship
Liaise with DC over land acquisition and ensure timely and full payment of CCL
Arrange payment of additional compensation to the CCL according to PAP
entitlement and ensue its timely payment (assisted by partner organizations)
*     Prepare TORs for other organizations contracted to assist or implement resettleiient
plan components;
*     Select and monitor other organizations for resettlement subcontracts
*     Arrange purchase or handover of resettlement sites as specified in resettlement plan;,
*     ldentify acquired lands remaining after construction available for resettlement
Negotiate employment of appropriate PAPs with contractors
*     Prepare TOR for and determine who will make post-resettlement survey for post
evaluation of the programme
Make training plan for PMRU staff on the job ; and
Oversee NGO activities regarding squatters and PAPs in relevant areas.
The PMRU Deputy Director (Resettlement) will prepare a quarterly report for BWDB
covering progress compared with schedule and any problems or changes to the plan; for
example results of land value assessment, recision to PAPs, changes to cost estimates
following joint verification. The sub-contracted organizations will submit reports two weeks
in advance of this covering their activities, progress and problems.
VIII  TIME PLAN FOR RESETTLEMENT ACTIVITIES
CERP-II has been envisaged to be implemented in 7 (seven) years starting from 1994-95 (see
Fi2tire-1Il). Land acquisition, Resettlement activities and other preparatory activities
constitute the elementary part and the core physical construction works constitulte the linal
part of the project.

IX    BUDGET FOR RESETTLEMENT OF PAPs
(l)   Compensation Budget
Table below provides a summary of compensation budget estimates for all categories
of asset losses for the ten polders. In estimating the value of land, weighted average
of four price series as generated through the SES was used i.e. prices collected
through community level survey of key informants. PAP expectations on the value
of the land to be acquired and lastly, prices revealed through the survey on the actual
buying and selling of land by PAPs.
Total compensation cost for the ten polders with 50% premium on land price comes
to Tk. 79,099,050.
Non-land compensation accounts for only 18.2% of total compensation.

X   RESETTLEMENT OF SQUATTERS
10.1 General:
A different concern for the RAP is squatter rehabilitation. The guideline principle for
squatter rehabilitation within the context of CERP is to resettle squatters at the toe of the
embankment and functionally integrate them with the O&M  of these embankments. A
squatter Census Report and Resettlement Plan was separately produced in August 1993 by
Kampsax International.
The resettlement consultant, assisted by NGOs, will formally register the eligible PAPs and
Would include new squatters since Kampsax survey upto the date of new survey.
The squatter Resettlement plan has been conceived adjunct to the Social Developmenr and
Afforestation Programme associated with the CERP and thus it is now incorporated in the
total RAP for CERP-H.
The Resettlement Plan Per Polder (for II Polders) for squatters is given after the following,
suinmary proposal for the same.
10.2  Sqtiatters Resettlement Proposals,
Following the proposal for embankment afforestation, it is found that squatter families can
be absorbed into the programme to a density of four per linear kilometer.
A total of 709 families will be affected as a result of resectioning of embankments and that
the afforestation programme will provide a livelihood for 527 households if the population
density of four families per kilometer is strictly adhered to.
It is further assumed that some squatter families will be prepared to re-locate on polders
where sqtuatter density is relatively low and where surplus places are available.
Squatters will be given the option of moving immediately to their new homesteadi sites
(assuming these sites have been acquired in time) or being paid a temporary rental allowance
to cover the period until neighboring construction is completed. It is expected that most
would opt to mzove immediately to new homes at the back of the homestead plots, whici
would still allow contractors enough room on the berm for construction activities.
15



In Sandwip the standard ratio of 4 settler families per Km. will be maintained except for the
first 3.7 KIIm. of embankilment to be resectioned near Sandwip town, which accommodates
squatters with work and family connections in Sandwip town. In this area a continual berill
is provided to accommodate above 100 families. Similarly, in Ramgati a continuous berm
is provided for about 4 Km. of the embankment to be resectioned near Ramgati town, to
accommodate about 80 families, while the standard 4 settler families per Km. is maintained
elsewwhere.
35/1 Sarankhoia, 40/2 Patharghata, 59/3C Companiganj, 66/1 Cox's Bazar and 73/ lB Hatliya
all have surplus places. Minor modifications in plot size coupled with some relocation allows
the incorporation of all affected families in the afforestation scheme.
Minor modifications in plot size in polder 68, Teknaf, coupled withi somne relocatiOn ol the
population to take up surplus places in po]der 66/1 Cox's Bazar will provide sufficient places
for the population of these two polders.
The surplus squatter population in 59/2B Sudharam can be accommodate in surplus places
in 59/3C Companiganj and 73/lB Hatiya, while the surplus population of 70, Matherbari
could be accommnodate on surplus plots on 35/1 Sarankhola and 40/2 Patharghata.
This would leave polder 48, Kalapara and 59/2 Ramgati as having surplus population (11 and
26 families respectively) and these would have to be accommodated through decrease in plot
size to absorb the surplus population. Only households in 59/2 would experience any
significant decrease in project income through there being six families per kilometer. It is to
be mentioned here that as per Kampsax Report out of total 21 polders of CERP-11. 15
Polders have been stated to have squatters resettlement issue. Out of those 15, the plan tor
11 Polders has been outlined as follows.
10.3  Resettleimenit Plan by Polder
68 'rekiat :
Will be able to accommodate existing 63 families. with an additional 20 famililies being
relocated at 66/1 Cox's Bazar.
66/1 Cox's Bazar:
Will acconmnodate 20 families relocated from Teknaf,
16
'K



59/2B3 Su dha ram:
Can accommodate 93 families (with some minor decrease in plot size) and will have to
export a total of 89 households (66 to 59/3C Companiganj and 23 to 73/lB Hatiya).
73/l1 Hatiy:.
Will accommliodate 23 families from 59/2B Sudharam.
59/3C Conipaniganj
Can accommodate 66 new families form 59/3C Sudharam.
70 Matherbari:
Can accommnodate 36 families and will have to export a total of 23 households (12 to 35/1
Sarankhola and I I to 40/2 Patherghata).
40/2 Patherghata
Can accommnodate 11 new families from 70 Matherbari.
35/1 Sarankhola
Can accommlllocdate existing 16 families plus 12 from Polder 70, Matherbari
59/2 Rainigati:
Will be unable to export population and will therefore have to accommodate 81 houscholds
on an embankment 13.74 kilometers long. Each family will therefore have a plot of 0.67
hectares.
48 Kalapara
Will be able to accommodate existing population of 51 families with each family having 0.80
hectares.
72 Sandwip
Will be unable to export population and will therefore have to accommodate existing
population. this will result in each family having an 83 X 10 meter houselot together with
an 83 meter wide strip of embankment to maintain.

10.4  Estimated Resettlement Cost of Squatters
1.    Compensation for removal of dwelling to new polder.
value of materials for 10 X 7 foot thatch and bamboo dwelling
= Taka 5,000+20% for transportation expenses.
= Taka 6,000+ 132 households=                             Tk. 792,000
2.    Compensation for removal and re-erection of house
during resectioning=50%  ofvalue of materials
= Tk. 2,500 X 577 households=                             Tk. 1422,000
Total :Tk. 2,214,000
This is to mientioni that the estimate of cost for squatter resettlement was prepared by ihe
consultants uising 1991 prices. As of today, the price is simply escalated for last 3 years at
20% over the original estimate which gives a total cost of Tk. 265.68 lakh.

Safety net provision for continuing loss of income
This is an additional provision for existing EPs identified through one of the above
entitlement categories and through an updated survey 12 months after resettlement,
or eviction if only land or assets are lost.
The safety net function is to identify vulnerable groups i.e. those who have been
rendered vulnerable as a result of the project such as any landless or near-landless
EPs who have lost significant income and have not been able to restore it since.
This provision would be financed from the contingency head in the resettlement cost
estimates. Appropriate remedial measures, if any, under this allocations wouild be
dletermiinled after the updated survey when any EPs who have been rendered
vulllerable by project activities will be identitied.
This provision would be used to finance NGO self-help or training programme in the
project area which be extended to cover this target group.
