MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR A COASTAL EMBANKMENT REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed development credit to the People's Republic of
Bangladesh for SDR 34.1 million, the equivalent of US$53.0 million, on
standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance a project for
coastal embankment rehabilitation. Parallel grant financing for the project
(about US$19.7 million equivalent, plus $0.4 million for complementary poverty
alleviation activities)' would be provided by the European Community (EC).
While the World Food Program (WFP) cannot make long-term commitments, it is
anticipated that WFP would provide about $3.6 million equivalent in foodgrain
to assist the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) in meeting a portion of its
proposed contribution to the project.
2.        BackQround.  With a per capita income of US$220, Bangladesh remains
one of the poorest countries of the world and over half of its population of
110 million continues to live in conditions of absolute poverty. Agriculture
accounts for about 36% of GDP and about 60% of employment. Processed and
unprocessed agricultural products account for about 32% of exports.
Developing a capability for rice self-sufficiency through expansion of
irrigation and fertilizer use and improved seeds has been the central
objective of the Government's agricultural development strategy. This
strategy has been fairly successful and for the first time in recent memory
Bangladesh is now self-sufficient in rice production in years of good weather.
Nevertheless, Bangladesh still has to import wheat and other food products and
continued rapid population growth (reduced somewhat to 2.0% per annum) means
that Bangladesh must continue substantial efforts to accelerate agricultural
growth to keep ahead of population growth.
3.        Natural calamities are a recurring phenomenon in Bangladesh.  The
most severe occur in the form of cyclonic storms which affect the coastal
districts. The country has over 700 km of coastline on the mainland and
several offshore islands in the Bay of Bengal. Vulnerable areas include the
important port towns of Chittagong and Khulna, and the heavily populated
islands of Sandwip, Kutubdiya and Patiya. During the last 125 years, over 42
cyclones hit the coastal belt; 14 occurred during the last 25 years. Cyclones
often cause major destruction of human life, livestock, crops, properties, and
physical infrastructure. As such, cyclones tax the country's institutional
and financial capabilities, since resources have to be diverted to provide
immediate relief to the affected population and to restore damaged or
destroyed physical facilities.
4.        Recent cyclones causing widespread devastation and loss of life
occurred in November 1970, May 1985, November 1988, and April 1991. After the
cyclone of November 1970, GOB, assisted by IDA under the Coastal Area
Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 339-BD) and by other donors, initiated a
reconstruction program aimed at (a) rehabilitation of the economy of the
affected areas, and (b) provision of protection from future cyclones. The
benefits of these investments were demonstrated during the cyclone of May
1985. For example, the coastal embankment withstood the tidal surge at the
peak period and, although the embankment was overtopped or breached in several
places, the energy of the tidal surge was dissipated and, by and large, houses
remained in site. The radio system also worked satisfactorily and conveyed
warnings of the advent of the cyclone, and the cyclone shelters and other
1.    Figures are based on values of European Currency Unit as of June 1955.

facilities were used effectively. Due to these improvements, loss of life and
damage to infrastructure were relatively limited. However, destruction was
almost total on the unembanked islands and on the newly accreted parts of the
mainland where most people, with their houses and livestock, were swept away
by the tidal wave. By the time of the April 1991 cyclone, the embankments
were in a poor state of maintenance, and were breached in many locations. The
cyclone caused about 140,000 deaths and severe damage throughout the eastern
coast of the Bay of Bengal. Had the embankments been in better condition, the
damage would have been much less severe.
5.        In 1986 GOB formulated a National Cyclone Protection Program
including proposed programs for improving the existing coastal embankment;
protection of newly accreted lands; development of forests; improving
telecommunications, roads and coastal transport; and provision of improved and
less costly cyclone shelters, to be used also as schools and health
facilities. Improvements to the coastal embankments and protection of newly
accreted land were to be undertaken in two phases. The Mid-term Program would
strengthen existing coastal embankments, while the Long-term Program would
include the construction of embankments and associated structures for the
protection of newly accreted lands. After various delays, caused in part by
the 1987 and 1988 floods, a contract was signed with consultants (a joint
venture led by KAMPSAX International) financed by the EC, which included
provision for preparation of the Mid-term Program and developing Terms of
Reference (TOR) for a study of the Long-term Program.
6.        The consultants' studies were in progress when the April 1991
cyclone struck. At GOB's request, the World Bank agreed to coordinate donor
assistance. The Government also requested the consultants to prepare plans
and designs for a Priority Works Program (PWP) to provide for the most
urgently needed embankment repair and rehabilitation work. Funding was
arranged from Saudi Arabia (about $13.3 million equivalent), a Japanese grant
(about $23 million equivalent, under IDA administration), EC (about
$4 million), and $29 million from amendments to IDA credits 1467, 1784, 1870
and 2048, for a program including about 135 km of embankment rehabilitation
and about 55 km of new retired embankments. Work has been substantially
completed except for about $3 million of work which is proposed for financing
under this project. (About $2 million will complete a section of embankment
which had been delayed due to a dispute on the alignment and about $1 million
will be used for a polder where additional drainage improvements were found
necessary.)
7.        Following the April 1991 cyclone there was increased recognition
that reliable protection of human lives can be provided at the most economic
cost through a program of construction of additional cyclone shelters combined
with establishment of an appropriate cyclone disaster preparedness system.
Proposals for such a project are being prepared separately for consideration
in FY97. A component to improve road access to facilitate post-cyclone relief
operations, originally proposed as part of this project, is now being financed
by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The proposed coastal embankment
rehabilitation works under this project would complement the above efforts by
providing partial protection of crops and infrastructure, as well as providing
additional protection of human lives even after the construction of an
appropriate number of shelters. Even in areas of adequate shelters, a portion
of the population does not leave their homes (since most cyclones do not turn
out to be severe, and leaving home risks theft of possessions). Moreover,
embankments provide inhabitants more time to reach shelters safely.
8.        While the project was originally planned primarily in terms of
cyclone protection, it has important benefits in increasing agricultural
production, through protecting coastal agricultural areas from saline
inundation during normal annual monsoons, improved cropping patterns due to
the reduced cyclone risks, and better drainage. Most of the proposed project



works would be economically viable on the basis of such increases in
agricultural production, even without the benefits of the project in reducing
cyclone damage and saving human lives.
9.        Proiect Obiectives.  The project objectives are:  (a) cyclone
protection, including improving the security of persons living in the
protected area, reducing damage to houses and other buildings and
infrastructure, and minimizing the loss of crops and livestock; (b) increased
agricultural production due to preventing saline inundation during normal
weather and improved cropping patterns due to reduced cyclone risks; and
(c) introduction of improved technology in the design and construction of
protection works, and improved methods of embankments maintenance. In
addition, the use of a social forestry component for improved cyclone
protection and embankment maintenance would have ancillary benefits in poverty
alleviation, environmental improvement, and increased production of wood and
other forestry products.
10.       Prolect Description.  In view of the April 1991 cyclone, a portion
of the originally intended project has been financed separately under the PWP
(see para 6) to provide for the most urgently needed embankment repair and
rehabilitation work. However, the PWP works are still conceptually part of
the Mid-term Program for coastal embankment restoration. Therefore, the
proposed project would include, in addition to new polder improvement
investments, the ancillary investments needed to complement the emergency
embankment repairs financed under the PWP. The project would include
rehabilitation and improvement of 12 sea-facing embankments, plus small
amounts to complete similar works in 2 PWP polders, for a total of about 78 km
of rehabilitation and 75 km of new retired embankments (73 km of major works
and 2 km of minor works). In addition, the project would include the
following additional components covering the above polders and the PWP
polders: (a) afforestation of the embankments and a 50 to 200 meter wide belt
on the foreshore to reduce cyclone damage and embankment maintenance costs;
(b) improved embankment operations and maintenance; (c) minor improvements in
the non-coastal sections of the polders in the program, including re-
excavation of khals, repair or replacement of regulators/sluices, or minor
improvements in embankments where appropriate to assure agricultural benefits;
(d) resettlement of people displaced by the project; (e) project support
and environmental monitoring; (f) training; and (g) vehicles and equipment.
(In addition, EC is financing a Community Development Fund for supporting
poverty alleviation activities complementary to the Project.) The project
design was selected following economic and technical analysis of alternative
embankment slope and height standards, and slope protection methods (blocks,
bricks, afforestation) to determine a cost-effective design with reduced
maintenance costs. The proposed design, including embankment parameters, use
of afforestation and community participation in maintenance, reflects the
results of these studies. The project's cost is estimated at US$87.8 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$26.2 million (30*) and
duties and taxes of US$7.0 million. A breakdown of project costs and the
financing plan are presented in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursement, and the disbursement schedule are in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
Operations in Bangladesh are shown in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 11675-BD, dated October 16,
1995 is being distributed separately.
11.       Project Implementation.  A community participation approach is
proposed for dealing with the issues of afforestation, routine embankment
maintenance, and resettlement of families displaced by project works
(including squatters on the embankments whose houses and planting activities
weaken the embankment structure). Squatters and those made landless by land
acquisition under the project (and other landless people to the extent of
available space) would be settled at the toe of the embankment on the inland



side and would be given contracts allowing them to reside on this allotment
and obtain the produce of the trees on a given section of the embankment
(normally about 1 ha.), in return for providing routine maintenance of their
section of the embankment and maintaining trees on the embankment. They would
be paid for their embankment maintenance activities by Bangladesh Water
Development Board (BWDB) for four years, by which time the trees are expected
to have grown sufficiently to provide an adequate income when combined with
earnings from the homestead plot. The payments would be phased down as the
income from the trees increased. The settlers would also be provided
seedlings, pesticides and fertilizer for three years, and technical assistance
in planting approved species on the embankment. In areas where sufficient
land on the foreshore is government owned, groups of landless people would be
employed to plant trees on the foreshore and be given contracts giving them
rights to 2/3 of the produce in return for responsibility for maintaining such
areas permanently under tree cover. The remaining 1/3 share would go to the
local elected council (Union Parishad) for financing local investments. Non-
Government Organizations (NGOs) active in the respective project areas would
be employed to mobilize the local people to participate in the project and to
provide training in planting and maintenance of trees and in embankment
maintenance. BWDB and Forest Department (FD) would provide necessary
technical training to NGO staff, and possibly directly to community
participants. In areas where the only available foreshore land is privately
owned, FD would hire community groups to plant the seedlings, in return for
the landowners' agreement to maintain the area under trees. The landowners
would receive compensation for foregone crop production until income from the
trees is available and would have the right to the produce of the trees, but
would be obligated to replant trees in areas of harvesting.
12.       Most project components would be implemented by BWDB, while FD
would be responsible for foreshore afforestation (including mangrove
nurseries), support for NGO establishment of nurseries for non-mangrove
species, and providing advice and training to NGOs organizing the embankment
afforestation component. NGOs would organize community participation in the
afforestation and embankment maintenance components. Consultants would play a
major role in supervision of construction and design and coordination of the
training programs, and would assist in other aspects of project
implementation. A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and a Forestry Project
Implementation Unit (FPIU) would be responsible respectively for overall
management of all BWDB and FD components of the project. Project coordinating
committees at the national, district, and subdistrict (Thana) levels,
including representatives of BWDB, FD, the NGOs, the agricultural extension
services, and at the Thana level, the Union Parishad Chairmen of Unions in the
Project, would coordinate project implementation. The project would require
an implementation period of seven years, since the embankment afforestation
and improved O&M programs must be staged to follow embankment completion. All
other components would be completed within five years.
13.       Experience under Prior Projects.  While experience with IDA-
supported forestry projects in Bangladesh has been generally satisfactory,
prior IDA-financed BWDB projects have been affected adversely by delays in
land acquisition and processing of civil works contracts, insufficient local
funding allocations, poor quality construction and inadequate maintenance.
However, in recent years adequate funding of IDA-financed BWDB projects has
not been a problem. Based upon prior sector work, a BWDB institutional reform
program was agreed in September 1994 and performance to date in implementation
of the program has been satisfactory. Key measures include approval of
Guidelines for Peoples Participation in project design and operations,
introduction of an improved accounting system, a phased program to separate
staff and responsibilities between construction and Operation and Maintenance
(O&M), and reforms in personnel policies. Under this project, use of
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) for works on sea-facing embankments,
prequalification for contractors, and supervision by experienced consultants



are expected to improve performance in contracting and construction quality.
Improved land acquisition procedures and improved compensation payments are
also expected to reduce delays. For National Competitive Bidding (NCB) civil
works, we have reached agreement on minimum size contract packages and use of
Class A contractors (or expatriate firms with equivalent qualifications). The
project also incorporates community participation and other measures designed
to improve maintenance of project works.
14.       Project Sustainabilitv.  The arrangements described in para 11
above for community participation in maintenance and the initiation of the
improved O&M program under the project with consultants' assistance are
expected to improve embankment maintenance and project sustainability. The
annual O&M costs, estimated at slightly over $1 million per year at project
completion (excluding repairs following major cyclones occurring less
frequently than once in 5 years) are considered sustainable. Since the
project involves rehabilitation of existing works, it does not add to the
requirements for adequate maintenance.
15.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  In light of IDA's past efforts in
assisting Bangladesh to develop programs for dealing with the issue of
recurrent cyclones, GOB requested IDA to coordinate donor assistance following
the April 1991 cyclone. IDA agreed and assembled the financing package for
the PWP (para 6). The proposed project would extend the PWP program to
additional areas, as well as provide investments to complement those financed
under the PWP. The project should also enable IDA to maintain the ongoing
dialogue with GOB on appropriate disaster control policies and institutional
support. Finally, the proposed project would protect past and ongoing IDA
investments in the coastal belt, specifically the Coastal Area Rehabilitation
Project (Cr. 339-BD) completed in 1980; Flood Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 587-
BD) completed in 1986, which included repair of damages caused by the May
1985 cyclone; Second Flood Rehabilitation (Cr. 1876-BD) completed in 1989,
which included repair of damage during the 1987 floods; and the on-going
Second Small Scale Flood Control and Drainage Project (Cr. 1870-BD). A
revised Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) is scheduled to be presented at the
same time as this operation. The CAS emphasizes,inter alia, the importance of
agricultural growth, development of rural infrastructure, and the need to
reduce the negative impact of flooding on people's lives and livelihood.
16.       Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreements were reached with
GOB on (a) provision of adequate funds for O&M during the project and after
completion; (b) appointment of consultants with acceptable TOR prior to
signature of civil works contract; (c) contract framework and schedule for
entering into contracts with NGOs; (d) model agreements with embankment
settlers, foreshore afforestation groups, and private owners of foreshore
land; (e) land acquisition and resettlement arrangements; (f) completion of
vehicle and equipment procurement (other than replacement bicycles/motorcycles
for field staff) by December 31, 2000; (g) maintenance of PIU, FPIU and
project coordinating committees until project completion; and (h) arrangements
and schedule for mid-term reviews.
17.       Since negotiations GOB has (a) issued an order allocating
appropriate publicly owned foreshore land for afforestation; (b) approved the
revised resettlement plan; and (c) assisted by NGOs, initiated verification of
appropriate compensation for land required for the first year's construction
program. BWDB and FD have signed an agreement on implementing arrangements,
established the PIU, FPIU and Project Resettlement Units and appointed key
staff. Conditions of effectiveness are (a) approval of the Project Proforma;
and (b) fulfilling conditions of effectiveness of the EC grant.
18.       Environmental Imnact.  The proposed project has been placed in
environmental impact category B. Overall, the project is expected to have a
positive environmental impact. In addition to saving lives and property, the



proposed project would reduce salinity damage to soils and increase forestry
resources. Problems reported in the past of coastal embankments causing
localized drainage congestion and damage to inland fisheries would be handled
by provision of adequate drainage structures and appropriate operation of
regulators. Shrimp inlets have been included where appropriate. No rivers
would be blocked by the proposed project, so that access of fish to the flood
plain for spawning would not be affected.
19.       Program Obiective Categories.  The project, as part of the GOB
Five-Year Development Program, would address poverty reduction, natural
resources development, and environmental improvement objectives.
20.       Beneficiaries.  The operation would directly benefit about 1.2
million people living in the project area. This includes about 600,000 people
living where the sea-facing embankments would be rehabilitated and another
600,000 people benefitting from improved embankment O&M, afforestation, and
minor embankment improvements for polders for which the rehabilitation of the
sea-facing embankments was financed under PWP. While regional data on incomes
is not available, the coastal areas have lower farm incomes due to the effects
of salinity on crop yields and low adoption of high yielding varieties (HYVs).
While the project is not specifically poverty focussed, the loss of life and
property during cyclones affects disproportionately the poor, with weakly
constructed homes and least ability to recuperate.
21.       Project Benefits.  The main project benefits would be fewer human
lives lost and less property destroyed during cyclones, and prevention of
salinity intrusions and storm surges during normal monsoons, leading to
increased agricultural production and employment. Social forestry for cyclone
protection and embankment maintenance would have ancillary benefits in poverty
alleviation, environmental improvement, and increased output of wood and other
forestry products.
22.       Benefits in human lives saved are impossible to quantify and are
not included in the economic analysis. However, it is estimated that about
140,000 people were killed in the project area during the 1991 cyclone. The
embankments would help save lives during future cyclones. Although
overtopping could still occur after the construction of the new embankments,
the flooding of the polders would be slowed and reduced. The massive sudden
flooding of 1991, which happened due to breaches in the embankments or missing
sections, would not happen in a "with project" situation. Delayed flooding
would give more time for the people to escape to safer areas or cyclone
shelters.
23.       Most of the quantifiable benefits would come from increased crop
production. Production during normal monsoons would increase over the
"without project" situation due to both (i) the direct effects of decreased
saline intrusions; and (ii) the effects of reduction in periodic cyclone
damage in inducing farmers to plant higher yielding crops requiring larger
investment in inputs. Small complementary works to be provided would improve
drainage in the project area, increasing agricultural production further.
Annual incremental crop production at full development is estimated at 87,700
metric tons. In addition to the normal year benefits, the embankments would
protect crops, livestock, cultural fisheries and shrimp farms during major
cyclones. It is estimated that about 50% and 40% of the crops would be saved
in the case of cyclonic surges with a frequency of once in 10 years and 20
years respectively.
24.       Other quantifiable benefits include reduction in cyclone damage to
buildings and infrastructure, and the fruit, timber, and fodder provided under
the afforestation program. The afforestation program would also provide
environmental benefits and income for landless families. In addition, the
project would demonstrate improved technology for embankment construction and



- 7 -
improved embankment maintenance methods which hopefully would be adopted
elsewhere.
25.       Economic Analysis.  The estimated average Economic Rate of Return
(ERR) for new project works (i.e., not including the PWP polders), excluding
any value of human lives saved, is estimated to be about 19.2%. This average
includes three polders with ERRs of less than 12% (i.e. between 6.5% and 8*).
The inclusion of these polders is considered justified taking account of the
important but non-quantifiable benefits of saving human lives.
26.       Risks.  the project confronts several important risks.
(a) Insufficient community Participation. Community participation
merges pieces of other programs, but is untried in its proposed
form. The cost of routine embankment maintenance would increase
substantially if the afforestation component failed and future
rehabilitation costs would also rise. The proposed component has,
nevertheless, a better probability of success than traditional
means of embankment maintenance precisely because it involves
beneficiary participation.
(b) Poor inter-institutional coordination. The community participation
component requires coordination between BWDB and FD. Poor
coordination could delay implementation and cause benefits to be
foregone during the waiting period. The agreement between BWDB and
FD (para 17) is intended to reduce such delays. Two mid-term
reviews would help to adjust the operation if necessary, in light
of project experience.
(c)  Inadeauate Government funding.  The investment and O&M costs of
this project can be met within available budgetary resources,
without distorting priorities. Nevertheless, inadequate Government
funding remains a risk, despite recent improvements. Inadequate
funding, like poor inter-institutional coordination, could delay
implementation and postpone benefits. However, the devastation
caused by the April 1991 cyclone is expected to lead to political
pressure to overcome problems which would delay the proposed
project. Inadequate financing of O&M would reduce the life of the
investments requiring premature rehabilitation. The project, by
replacing existing deteriorated embankments, does not add to the
costs of adequate embankment maintenance. In fact the
afforestation for routine maintenance should reduce maintenance
costs. Indicative budget requirements for O&M were agreed at
negotiations. Finally, the community participation design of the
project is expected to bring additional pressure on the government
to provide adequate funding.
(d)  Management and institutional weaknesses.  The risk of
implementation delays and poor quality construction is being
addressed through the use of internationally recruited consultants
for supervision of construction, using prequalified contractors
selected through ICB for the sea-facing embankments, and initiating
tendering and land acquisition prior to Board presentation.
(e) Overestimation of Yields or farmer response. The estimated yields
and rate of conversion to HYV are based on experience from other
areas in Bangladesh, adjusted to take account of limited
availability of dry season water supply and other regional
constraints. While the resulting estimates are believed to be
realistic, all such estimates are subject to a margin of error.

27.       Sensitivity analysis, based on the above risks, shows that it is
unlikely that unfavorable developments would reduce the ERR for the project to
12*. If the life of the embankments is reduced due to inadequate maintenance,
major additional expenditure on embankment rehabilitation would be required in
about 10 years and 25 years after project completion, which would reduce
average ERR from 19.2% to 17.1%. Implementation delays could defer benefits.
Overestimation of yields or of the rate of farmer conversion to HYV would also
reduce benefits. However, to bring the ERR on quantifiable benefits below 12%
would require a combination of a two year delay in project completion and a
decrease in project benefits exceeding 30%, or a three year delay in project
completion and a decrease in project benefits of about 20%. Other
combinations which would reduce the ERR to 12% would include a two year delay
in project completion and an increase in O&M costs of over 30%, or a three
year delay and an increase in O&M costs of about 15%. Such combinations of
unfavorable developments are considered unlikely. Even then, the additional
non-quantifyable benefits of saving human lives would still make the project
worth doing.
28.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed development
credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and
recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

a. While terms of reference for preparation studies were originally drafted
in 1985, work was delayed initially by GOB insistence on obtaining grant
financing rather than proposed IDA financing, and later by the
disastrous 1987 and 1988 floods which diverted attention from the
proposed studies. An agreement between GOB and EC for financing the
studies was signed in April 1989 and a contract with the selected
consultant was signed in February 1990.

program and preparation of an acceptable resettlement action plan.
