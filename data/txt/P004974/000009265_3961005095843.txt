MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
FOR A WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE REHABILITATION PROJECT
I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  memorandum  and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Democratic and Popular
Republic of Algeria for the equivalent of US$110 million to help
finance a Water Supply and Sewerage Rehabilitation Project.  The
loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a
maturity of 17 years, including 5 years of grace.
1.          BackgrQuU4.   Algeria,  a middle-income  country with a current
population of 26 million, is endowed with moderate water resources. The current
available per capita water resources in the northern part of the country, where
90 percent of the population lives, are about 760 m3/year, compared with 1,200
m3/year in neighboring Morocco. By and large, water consulmption in Algeria is
for irrigation, urban supply, and industrial process. In 1990 the irrigation
sector consumed almost two-thirds of the mobilized re.s.ources, while the rest was
used for urban supply and by industries.   Presently,  irrigated farming is
practiced in only 4 percent of the arable land in Algeria.  The Government,
however, has an ambitious program for expanding irrigation in newly opened land.
At the same time, as the population and the economy continue to grow, more water
will be needed to meet urban demand.  Together with the proposed irrigation
expansion. it is estimated that total net water consumption in the year 2010 will
reach 5 billion m3, about 75 percent of the total mobilizable fresh water
resources in the country.
2.          The urban water supply sector in Algeria is fairly well developed in
terms of coverage of the population.   An estimated 81 percent of the total
population has direct access to the pub'lic water supply network through private
service lines. The rest of the population is served by standposts and private
wells. These services, however, are not provided efficiently. Almost 50 percent
of the water production is unaccounted for.   It is estimated that, if this
percentage can be reduced to a more acceptable level of around 20 percent,
required additional water production for urban use by the year 2010 could be
reduced by 60 percent, with a proportionate reduction in capital investments in
the sector.
3.          Service levels are somewhat lower in the sewerage subsector.  Public
sewer systems exist in most urban areas, but are presently in great need of
repair and better operation.   Large volumes of wastewater are discharged
untreated into the Mediterranean and the rivers. It is estimated that in 1992
less than 20 percent of domestic and industrial wastewater receivAd any treatment
prior to disposal. A number of wastewater treatment plants have been built
across the country, but most of them are inoperative. As a result, serious
environmental degradation has taken place in Algeria's large urban areas.
4.          Water supply and sewerage services in Algeria are provided by 35
publicly owned utilities. Some of them are regional organizations, while others
are confined to a single province. As parastatals, they have had access to
Government subsidies for both capital investments and operations.   Until
recently, the Government, eager to maintain low water tariffs, had relied on its
general revenues to cover these subsidies. This policy, however, is changing as
the Government consented in early 1993 to double the tariffs, and to further
increase them by 33 percent as of January 1st, 1994. As a result, the utilities,
financial situation is forecast to greatly improve in 1994.   Still,  this



improvement needs to be ironed out in a policy framework that would ensure
economic and financial sustainability in the sector. New policies should also
aim at introducing greater efficiency in providing water services in the country,
so as to promote conservation of the limited resources. The proposed project
attempts to put in place these progressive policies.
5.          Project Obiectives.  The proposed proje_t would seek to ensure that
water supply and sewer systems in Algeria are operated and maintained more
efficiently.   To this end, the oroject proposes transforming the existing
parastatals into self-financing water utilities that would manage these systems
undee concession agreements with the Governmer.t. The concession fees would be
used to finance new investments in the sector, chus easing the sector's burden
on the Government's general revenues. The project further recommends contracting
out some of the utilities' operations, such as leak detection and repair, and
streamlining of meter reading and billing procedures, with private entrepreneurs.
At present, a national tariff structure, covering only operating costs, is
applied in the country.   It is proposed to change this policy with the
introduction of regional tariffs that would meet operating and maintenance costs,
and asset renewal and expansion in the country. Funds for the latter would be
covered by the concession fees.
6.          A rehabilitation ptogram would be implemented to reduce the current
water losses in the project area by half.  Until now, no institution has been in
place to manage wastewaters in the country, and no funds have been allocated on
a regular basis for operation and maintenance of wastewater systems.   This
project takes a first step toward rational management of wasLewaters in Algeria,
conditioning new investments in sewerage on the availability of well-structured
organizations and funds for their operation and maintenance. The expectation is
that by the er.d of project implementation, water pollution would be reduced, with
consequential enhancement of urban environment and water quality.
7.          Eroject Description and Implementation.  The project would include:
(a) water network rehabilitation (U$$103.3 million): (b) wastewater treatment
plant rehabilitation (US$19.7 million); (c) studies and environmental impact
assessments (US$15.5 million); (d) supply of operational equipment (US$12.8
million); (e) institutional development assistance (US$15.1 million); and (f)
project implementation (US$3.6 million). Detailed estimated project costs and
financing plan are provided in Schedule A, while procurement and disbursement
methods are given in Schedule B.  The project would be implemented by the
Ministry of Equipment through its regional offices in the wilayate (Direction de
1 'Hydraulique de la Wilaya - DEW) and the national urban water agency, AGEP, with
the assistance of consultants for construction supervision and the studies.
Except for the wastewater treatment rehabilitation program, preparations for the
other components are about to be completed. A number of wastewater treatment
plants to be rehabilitated under the project have been identified during project
appraisal. The rest should be selected and appraised at the latest during the
first year of project implementation, on the basis of criteria that were agreed
upon at negotiations.
8.          A Bank loan of US$110 million is proposed to finance the foreign
exchange component of tie project. The balance would be financed by concession
fees and Government funds.
9.          ProJect Sustainability. The proposed policy reforms are expected to
provide the institutional environment required for sustainable development of the
urban water supply sector in Algeria.   Through the establishment of self-



-3-
financing utilities, the necessary structure would be put in place for diligent,
efficient operation and maintenance of the water systems. Through the concession
agreements, funds would be generated to finance new investments in the sector.
Under these agreements, the tariffs necessary for the utilities to meet their
financial oblivations including the concession fees, would be defined and indexed
to inflatJon and cost increases.  At the same time, incentives would be proviued
to the utilities' management for reducing and controlling costa, by allowing them
to share revenue surplus ensuing from operations, amlong their staff.
10.         Lessons from erevious Bank Loans.  So far, the Bank has made flive
loans for a total of US$889 million to the water supply and sewerage sector in
Algeria. Two of these are still under implementation. Performance under Bank-
financed projects has been mixed, reflecting the institutional constraints in the
sector.  These projects have contributed to major improvements of water supply
services in the country's largest urban areas, but some of the institutional
reforms sought with these loans have not materialized.   The Bank recently
completed a Water Resources Development Strategy Paper on Algeria, spelling out
recommendations for institutional reforms in the sector in relation to
organizational arrangements and pricing.  Also, under the fifth water supply
project (Loan 2821-AL), consultants were retained to re-v-iew the management and
operation of the water utilities.    The  Strategy Paper,  as well  as  the
consultants' recommendae.ions, have been used to agree with the Government on the
structure, orientation, and future policies of the sector.
11.         Rat5ionale  for Bank Involvemen.    The proposed project  is  in
conformity with the country assistance strategy. It tits into the Bank's interim
lending strategy for Algeria, that focuses on priority social and infrastructure
sectors, such as urban water supply and sewerage. The Algerian Uovernment is
facing the difficult task of streamlining management and policies J.n the water
sector, with a view to protecting the resource base for future generations. As
essential elements of this strategy, it would need to reduce water losses and
increase wastewater treatment, as contemplated in the project. It would further
have to implement policies and enact regulations that would encourage water
conservation. In pursuing these objectives, the Government has indicated its
desire to receive Bank assistance. Our involvement would be fully justified, as
Bank advice would be quite valuable to the Government in implementing the
proposed new institutional approaches.  Given the limited water resources in
Algeria, the water sector is bound to play an important role in promoting
sustainable economic development in this country.
12.         There is no international waterway issue under the proposed project.
The cities where the water distribution rehabilitation program would be
implemented are far away from the borders with neighboring countries.   The
project contemplates the recovery of water now lost through leaks in the
distribution network, but no new withdrawal from water sources. None of the
sewage treatment plants that might be rehabilitated unaer the project, discharges
treated wastewater into an international waterway. The proposed rehabilitation
program of these plants would be most beneficial in improving the quality of
water flows in Algeria.
13.         A1reed Actions.   (a)   Institutional Arrangements:   There are
currently nine regional and twenty-six provincial water utilities in Algeria.
Ideally, for economies of scale, it is desirable that the regional utilities take
over the provincial ones, so as to provide regional cross-subsidies and lower
tariffs in provinces with high costs. Nevertheless, some provinces might decide
to stay out of regionalization and to continue operating their own utilities.



-4-
But as for the regional utilities, they would have to set out tariffs sufficient
to cover their operating expenses and to pay concession fees to the Government.
At present, all the utilities rely on a national tariff schedule for their
revenues. As outlined in para. 17(c) of this memorandum, beginning January 1st,
1997, regional tariffs will be applied to replace the current national tariffs.
14.         It has been agreed with the Government that possible takeover of
provincial utilities would be accomplished through managed competition among the
regional utilities. To decide on how the merger of a provincial utility should
be carried out, regional utilities bordering the province in question, would be
asked to submit concessionary bids for the takeover. The most efficiently run
regional utility should be expected to win the bid. This process should lead to
the least-cost institutional arrangements for providing water supply services in
Algeria.
15.         While alignment of the provinces into the regional utilities is
taking place during the next two and a half years, institutional development
assistance would be provided to all the utilities.   Meanwhile,  concession
agreements would be signed immediately with the two besi. run utilities in the
country, EPE.OR in the West, and EPEA in the East.  In addition to concession
fees, the agreements would spell out tariff schedules, network expansion rate,
service quality, performance le-als, auditing requirements, and mutual
obligations. During the next two and a half years, the execution of these two
concess40ons would be monitored to determine any necessary change in the outlined
institutional approaches.   By January 1st, 1997, concession agreements, as
modified during the transitory period and approved by the Bank, would be executed
with all utilities in the sector, whether regional or provincial.   Project
success is dependent upon the structure of these agreements that would dictate
sector policies in the country during the next seven  years.   Given their
importance, drafts of the concession agreements were reviewed and approved by the
Bank during negotiations. Their execution with EPEA and EPEOR is a condit.on of
loan effectiveness.
16.         (b)      Regulatorv  Agency:      As  concession  agreements  are
institutionalized for sector operations, the Government would need to have in
place an independent, strong, financially automous agency to regulate sector
management. This agency should supervise the execution of the concessions, keep
records of the Government-owned assets in the sector, manage the concession
funds, and execute investments to be borne by the Government. In carrying out
this task, the agency would need to closely supervise the utilities' operations
and quickly take corrective measures when necessary. It has been agreed with the
Government to make AGEP this regulatory agency. To this effect, AGEP's present
status as a public administration would be changed to a commercial and industrial
enterprise (EPIC). A small percentage of the concession fees would be used to
finance ACEP's operations. During negotiations, agreement was reached with the
Government that the decree setting out AGEP's new role and responsibilities,
would be issued by July 1st, 1996. Under the proposed project, institutional
development assistance would be provided to AGEP to help it discharge its
functions in the sector.
17.         (c) Water Tariffs:  A national water tariff structure is currently
applied in Algeria. However, the Government has agreed, by January 1st, 1997,
to adopt a regional-based tariff structure. The Government doubled water tariffs
in 1993. They have further been increased by 33 percent since January 1st, 1994.
This additional increase was necessary to allow the two selected regional



-5-
utilities, EPEOR and EPEA, to meet their obligations under the concession
agreements. As part of these agreements, the Government has agreed to index the
tariffs to cost increases and inflation.
18.         (d)   Sewerage Tariffs:  Beginning in 1993, the Government had begun
levying a surcharge of 10 percent on water charges to cover the operating cost
of sewerage. This surcharge was increased to 20 percent as of January 1st, 1994,
but iv still considered insufficient. The project sewerage component would cover
rehajilitation works that would be selected during project execution. They would
account for less than 12 percent of the total costs, and would concern a limited
area in the country.  Consequently, it is not now recommended to request an
overall sewerage tariff increase. Rather, prior to Bank loan disbursement for
a sewer&ge subproject, agreement would be reached with the Government on ways to
meet its operating and maintenance costs. Also, an appropriate, well-stractured
organization should be in place to operate and maintain the facilities built
under the subprcjeet.
19.         Sector Development Policy Letter.  The Strategy Paper mentioned in
para. 10 has made a number of recommendatiens concerning the sharing and use of
water resources between irrigation and urban supply, the establishment of
environmental management offices in the country's hydrographic regions, and
wastewater reuse. The Government has transmitted a 'Development Policy Letter",
dated -March 19th, 1994, reflecting its agreement to these recommendations. In
addition, the letter spelled out the Government's commitment to enter into
concession agreements with all utilities by January 1st, 1997. Also, as of that
date, regional tariffs would be applied for water cons'.mption. Whenever it is
necessary, the tariffs for domestic consumption of more than 220 m3 per family
per year, and for public, com-ercial, and industrial consumption would be
progressively increased to the levels of the respective long-run marginal costs
in the regions by the year 2000.
20.         Financial Performance.   The proposed concession agreements are
expected to enhance financial stability and performance in the sector. These
agreements would have a six-year renewable duration. Both the concession fees
and the tariffs would be indexed to future cost increases and inflation on an
annual basis.   The tariffs would be set at the levels necessary to cover
operating expenses, pay the concession, and generate a net income equivalent to
about 20 percent of the cost of personnel. This income will be retained by the
utility and shared among its staff. This scheme is expected to provide strong
incentives to the staff for increased productivity and higher performance.
21.         Project Benefits. By the time the project is completed in year 2000,
the leak detection component is expected to recover some 32 MI3/year. Based on
the current production cost of DA 3.0/m3, this component should generate a high
rate  of  return,  now  estimated  to be  about  17  percent.    The  proposed
rehabilitation of wastewater treatment plants would provide major health and
environmental benefits in terms of water pollution abatement. These benefits
include: (i) reduced expenses for health care; (ii) welfare improvement of women
and children who are the primary collectors of water; (iii) higher productivity
and learning ability of children in school; (iv) improved welfare of the
population at large, stemming from a cleaner and better environment; and (v)
workers' higher productivity as a result of better health. It is difficult,
however, to quantify these benefits in monetary terms. Through the recovery of
treated water now unaccounted for, the proposed project would make it possible
to stretch out the use of fresh water resources in Algeria, and to postpone
resorting to more expensive treatments such as demineralization and desalination.



-6-
22.         Environmental  AsDects.    The  proposed  program  bears  a  major
environmental focus.  By stopping water leaks ir the distribution nietwork, it
will improve sanitation in urban areas.  As a result, waterlogging, would be
avoided, lessening the possibility of creating favorible conditions for tho
development  and spread  of vector-borne  diseases.    Tho rehabilitationi of
wastewater treatment facilities wiould contribute to a major improvement of water
quality. Nevertheless, because treacment plants and other project construction
may have limited adverse environmental effects, the project has been rated
Category B. Neiessary precautionis would be takern to keep construction effects
such as noise, air pollution, ana populatiotn influx, to a miniwum.
23.         Poverty Reductioni.  lhe proposed project is not directly targeted at
poverty reduction. But it is expected to be most bene£icial to the poor. The
water rehabilitation program would bring additional supply to urban fringe areas
where the poor live. As a result, they would be able to have their dwellings
directly connected to the network, and in this way improve sanitation in their
living quarters. Wastewaters, now generated in urban areas, are spread untreated
in the cities' outskirts, where most poor live. By taking these wastes out of
these areas and treating them prior to disposal, the project wouLd greatly
improve environmental conditions around the cities, and ease the resulting
pollution burden on the poor. Thus, a large proportion of project beneficiaries
would be poor people.
24.         Risks.   There are sone risks associated with project execution.
Given the current political instability in Algeria, project implementation might
be disrupted by civil disorder. This will also homper our supervision efforts.
The Government might rot live up to its obligations under the concession
agreements with the utilities, and to its commitment to implement the outlined
policy reforms such as the application of regional tariffs by January 1st, 1997.
A mid-term review would be carried out in the summer of 1997 to evaluate progress
in project implementation.   Depending upon the results of thi.s review, Bank
association with the project will continue, will be modified, or withdrawn.
25.         Other risks are related to possible slow implementation pace of the
rehabilitation works. Tnese are generally tedious, difficult undertakings. As
they cannot be fully identified in advance, actual costs might be different from
estimates. To manage these risks, it is proposed to hold two seminars at project
inception,  to discuss actions that would need to be taken to keep project
execution and costs under control.
26.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executives
Directors approve it.
