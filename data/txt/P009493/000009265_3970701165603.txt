THIRD DHAKA WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:       Peoples' Republic of Bangladesh (GOB)
Beneficiaries:  Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (DWASA)
Dhaka Municipal Corporation (DHC)
Amount:         SDR 26.4 Million (US$30 million equivalent)
Terms:          Standard
Relending
Terms:          The Government of Bangladesh will on-lend US$25.2 million
of the proceeds of the Credit to DWASA and DMC at an
annual interest rate of 11.5Z repayable in equal installments
of principal and interest over 20 years following a 5 year
grace period. The remaining US$4.8 million of the proceeds
of the Credit will be provided as a grant by the Government
to DWASA for the Deora ResettlemDnt.  The foreign exchange
risk will be borne by GOB.
Project
Description:    The objectives of the proposed Project are to:
(a) strengthen the institutional capabilities of DWASA,
emphasizing operating efficiency, cost recovery and manpower
development; (b) develop further DUASA's capacity to provide
water and sewerage services; (c) promote low-cost sanitation
and the development of a low-cost sanitation cell under DMC;
and (d) broaden DWASA's training program to benefit other
spctor agencie-s. These objectives vill be achieved through:
implementation of a large-scale leak detection and repair
program to reduce leakage and unaccounted-for weter;
installation of a computer system in DWASA for coiercial
management and monitoring of operations; study of DWASA staff
resources; expansion of training activities; extension of
water supply and sewerage facilities; rehabilitation of old
water mains and a pilot low-cost sanitation program. The
main risks to the proposed Project are that tariffs may not
be revised regularly and that improvements in operating
efficiency may be achieved more slowly than expected. The
Project will also provide for the resettlement of residents
at Demra, if necessary.

BANGLADESH
THIRD DHAKA WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
A. Demographic and Economic Trends in Bangladesh
1.01    BangLadesh is an overwhelmingly rural country with only about 171 of
its roughly 100 million people living in comfunities of more than 20,000
inhabitants. In recent years, its population has grown at a rate of about
2.6Z a year and its urban population has expanded at over 10Z a year. It is
expected that even though GOB has initiated a major program to decentralize
public administration and economic activity, about two-thirds of population
growth over the next 15 years nonetheless will take place in urban areas.
Dhaka, the capital city and a major manufacturing center, has grown by about
400,000 persons annually during the 1980s; its present population is about
3.5 million. The extraordinary rates of growth in urban areas have been due
Drimarily to rural-urban migration. This large population movement has
resulted from high population density and low incomes in rural areas,
exacerbated by crop failures and flooding.
1.02    The primary outlet for growth in population will continue to be in
the urban sector since few additional employment opportunities exist in
agriculture. Moreover, the longer term development of Bangladesh will be
primarily in labor intensive manufacturing. These realities underscore the
importance of looking closely at the efficiency and effectiveness with which
limited resources can be used to provide urban infrastructure, including
water supply and sanitation, on a sufficiently large scale.
B. The Water Supply and Sewerage Sector
1.03    Bangladesh lies in the delta of the Ganges and Bhramaputra Rivers and
receives about 1,500 mm of raiafall annually.  Surface water, while abundant,
is often heavily polluted and thus causes a high incidence of cholera and
other water-related diseases. Moreover, since the country is very flat,
there are few opportunities for impounding rivers to control dry season
flows. The sand and clay soils of the delta, however, provide excellent
water retention so that groundwater ;s both plentiful and inexpensive to
develop. The quality of groundwater is generally good; salinity is excessive
only in the coastal areas, and high levels of iron and manganese occur in
groundwater in a few scattered areas.



-2-
1.04    Responsibility for the water supply and sewerage sector resides in
the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives
(MLGRDC). The Ministry's Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) has
been assigned the tasks of planning, constructing and operating water supply
and sanitation facilities in the district towns. In Dhaka and Chittagong,
semi-autonomous agencies - the Water and Sewerage Authorities (DWASA and
CWASA) - have been established to build and operate the water supply and
sewerage facilities as public utilities. DWASA and CWASA are ezpected to
function on a commercial basis. In these two cities, the Dbaka and
Chittagong Municipal Corporations (DMC and CMC) are responsible for
sanitation activities other than waterborne sewerage. The Ministry's Rural
Public Works Program, which in the past has constructed minor rural civil
works, was reconstituted in 1984 as the Local Government Engineering Bureau
(LGE) and assigned the task of providing engineering services to the newly
formed Upazilas 1/ and cities that do not have municipal corporation status.
The DPHE and LGEB are assisting these local governments to construct their
own water supply and sanitation facilities under a national program to
decentralize responsibility for provision of local government services.
1.05    Capital investments in water supply and sewerage have been financed
primarily from external Grants and Credits. About 2.41 (Taka 330 crores) of
the Second Five-Year Plan (FY 1980-FY 1985) was couitted to the water supply
and sanitation sector; this figure included anticipated foreign assistance to
the sector. The World Bank Group has assisted the Dhaka and Chittagong
WASAs; the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Japanese Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund and Dutch Development Cooperation Department have financed
improvements in water supply in the district towns. In the 1980s, both the
Dhaka and Chittagong WASAs have recovered direct operating costs and
(until FY86) debt service from tariffs (for metered connections) and water
taxes (for unmetered connections) but they have been unable to generate the
positive 3-51 Rates of Return (ROR) which had been expected. The district
towns and Upazila centers receive grants from GOB to finance all capital
expenditures; revenues from the water tax recover only a portion of operating
costs. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that, overall, only
about half of the cost of capital investments, operations and maintenance are
recovered directly from beneficiaries in urban areas of Bangladesh. A
massive rural water supply and sanitation program has been executed by UNICEF
with substantial grant support from the Danish International Development
Agency (DANIDA). In addition, the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) and IDA have financed Projects to supply manually
operated shallow tubewells to be used for dry season irrigation and for
domestic water supply. There has been little cost recovery in rural areas.
11 Upazilas represent the third level of public administration. In
Bangladesh, there are currently 4 Divisions, 64 Districts and
464 Upazilas.



-3-
1.06    Currently, about 40Z of the urban population and half the rural
population are supplied water from wells. About a third of those rural
households supplied by wells have private wells. Throughout Bangladesh,
families typically rely on two or more water sources; ponds, rivers and
irrigation canals frequently are used for bathing and laundry while well
water is used for drinking and cooking. By the early 1980s, about 22Z of the
urban population and 31 of the rural population had sanitary facilities (a
pit latrine, septic tank or sewer connection). Only Dhaka has a waterborne
sewerage system, serving about a half million people. The Government of
Bangladesh (GOB) has set as its goals for the International Drinking Water
Supply and Sanitation Decade (which ends in 1990) 60X coverage by safe water
supply and 50% coverage by sanitation in urban areas; and 80Z coverage by
safe water supply and 20Z coverage by sanitation in rural areas. These
targets indicate GOB's pursuit of current planning priorities through
continued investment in Dhaka, Chittagong and other urban areas to help meet
the demands created by rapid population growth, while giving new emphasis to
the development of Upazilas under the Local Government Development Program.
1.07    The cost of meeting the Government's targets for the Decade was
estimated by WHO in 1982 to average Taka 260 crores a year over the ten year
period. GOB sector investment expenditures over the first half of the 1980's
averaged Taka 66 crores or 25% of the estimated average yearly cost of
meeting the targets. Since funding to the sector is unlikely to increase
substantially in the Third Plan, the prospects for meeting the targets are
very small. Improvements to urban service levels will be particularly
difficult given the high population growth rate and the relatively high unit
costs required to provide basic levels of services in densely populated
areas.
1.08    In addition to the shortage of funds, a shortage of manpower required
to operate and maintain the systems efficiently and the underdevelopment of
sector institutions impede expansion. Host sector agencies have not fully
developed procedures for managing systematically their operations, metering,
billing and revenue collection, or for monitoring of staff performance.
Trained personnel at the operating level are generally available in the major
urban centers but are in short supply in rural areas, where even the
maintenance of tubewells and handpumps is a problem. GOE recognizes these
deficiencies and is pursuing manpower training through the two WASAs and
DPHE.
C. The Greater Dhaka Area
1.09    The city of Dhaka is the administrative, commercial and industrial
center of the country. It became the national capital of Bangladesh at
independence in 1971. From 1971 to 1985, Dhaka grew at an estimated rate of
12.81 a year, reaching a population of about 3.5 million in mid-1985. Dhaka
is expected to have a population of about 8 million by the year 2000. Dhaka



-4-
and Chittagong (the nation's second largest city) have only 4.5Z of
Bangladesh's population but are the economic centers of the country and
together account for 22Z of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and more than 9OZ of
large-scale manufacturing activity. About 75Z of Dhaka's population lives
below the poverty threshold (para 7.06); and about 35% of the population is
living in conditions of extreme poverty with seriously deficient diets and
few basic urban services availabLe to them. Most of the poorest people are
not grouped icto slums but are scattered along roads, railways and other
rights of way, and therefore are difficult to provide with services. Over
the years, Dhaka has extended northward from the old riverside city, to areas
that do not have sufficient water supply and sewerage facilities. 1/ There
are also significant shortages in the Old City of Dhaka where water is
distributed from both public standpipes and individual connections. Low
system pressure leads to abuse and vandalism, which compound shortages.
1.10    Water Supply.  The supply of safe water to Dhaka has increased more
than six-fold since the end of the 1960s. However, due to population growth
the quantity of water produced per capita has increased by only 7Z over this
period. Current water production in Dhaka is about 413 million litres per
day (mld), which is approximately 242 mld less than estimated demand. About
27% of production is unaccounted-for, mostly due to system leakage and
somewhat to illegal connections.   Gross requirements for water are expected
to grow from 655 mld in 1985 to 800 mld by 1990, and to 1380 mld by 2000 if
population projections are realized (Annex 8). At present, about 90,000
individual water connections and 1,190 standposts supply water to about 582
of the city's population. DWASA estimates that at least another 15% of the
population is served indirectly by households with connections. Currently,
water revenues finance the costs of operating and maintaining the system but
do not fully cover debt service or depreciation. DWASA will remain unable
to supply water to all its residents for quite some time. At present,
domestic users (one-half of whom have unmetered connections) consume
about 88Z of the water distributed by DWASA; industry and commerce consume
about 6%; and GOB and community institutions together consume the remaining
6Z. Large industrial and commercial enterprises operate their own tubewells,
which are currently more dependable and less expensive than the public
system. UncontroLled abstraction of groundwater could draw down the aquifer
and render more shallow, neighboring wells useless. Legislation to control
abstractions has been proposed by both the Dhaka and Chittagong WASAs.
However, GOB has stated that it will not act on this proposal until the WASAs
are able to produce enough water to meet industrial and commercial demand.
1/ A study funded by the ADB, The Dhaka Metropolitan Area Integrated
Development Plan and Feasibility Study 1981, looks at various growth
alternatives for Dhaka and the inter-relation of various sectoral invest-
ments.



-5-
1.11    Sewerage and Sanitation.  The main trunk system for waterborne
sewerage currently covers about 75% of Dhaka's total area of 73 square
kilometers (km2). However, in 1980 there were only about 8,500 sewer
connections. Since then DWASA has undertaken a vigorous program to
accelerate connection to the sewers. About 25,000 connections now serve
about 550,000 people (15% of the population). Sewerage represents about
one-quarter of DWASA's operations (in terms of costs and revenues). It is
financed by user charges that are billed as a 100Z surcharge to the water
bill for all customers with a sewer connection. Properties located within
30 meters (m) of a sewer and served by a water but not a sewer connection,
are charged a moderate sewerage fee as well. Sewerage revenues currently
cover nearly 100% of the subsector's operating costs, depreciation and
interest payments. Notwithstanding, waterborne sewerage is very expensive
and cannot be afforded by the vast majority of Dhaka residents. With
increases in population, sewerage connections will probably continue to cover
only about 15% of the population. Even after substantial increases in water
supply are achieved, supplies of water to most houses will not be sufficient
to permit waterborne sewage collection. The Dhaka Municipal Corporation
(DMC) needs to pursue less costly, on-site sanitation alternatives (para
3.08) and DWASA in turn needs to expand its efforts to promote the proper use
of all sanitary facilities.
D. Long-Term Water Source for Dhaka
1.12    The central issue affecting the long-term development of water
supplies for the city of Dhaka is whether to rely upon surface or
groundwater. With very large scale abstraction of water from the aquifer,
the water table will decline resulting in higher energy costs for pumping and
perhaps diminished water quality. The optimal design of not only production
facilities but also the distribution system depends upon the nature and
location of the sources of raw water. In 1981, engineering consultants
completed a long term planning and feasibility study for DWASA, which
concluded that further groundwater development would both lower significantly
the water table and produce water of declining quality. The study
recomnended that a large surface water source be developed to augment Dhaka's
future water supply in order to cope with growing demand (Annex 8). The
Demra site on the Lakhya River about 10 km east of Dhaka was identified by
the study as the best site for a water treatment plant. The Government of
Bangladesh and IDA have agreed that the design of the proposed Demra Water
Treatment Plant could be financed under the TA Credit 1440-BD and that the
Third Dhaka Project could help to finance preparatory works for the plant's
development through the resettlement of approximately 20,000 persons who
presently live on the Demra site (para 3.14), provided that issues raised by
the Bangladesh Water Resources Master Plan Organization (NPO) can be
satisfactorily resolved. The MPO, which is funded by UNDP and IDA, has
expressed concern that: (a) dry season river flow at Deira may be
insufficient due to upstream withdrawals for irrigation and aggradation of
the river bed; (b) backflow of highly polluted water at Demra from other

rivers during the dry season may result in very high treatment costs; and
(c) available groundwater near Dhaka may be more plentiful than projected in
DWASA's studies, thus making groundwater development feasible and more
economical.
1.13    Under a UNDP grant, executed by IDA, DWASA engaged two specialists
to assess the previous studies on surface water and groundwater availability
and other related data in an attempt to resolve the discrepancies between
conclusions reached by consultants to DWASA and the MPO. These consultancies
are expected to be completed by July 31, 1986 (Action Plan, Annex 3) and at
that time a course of further action would be agreed between DWASA and IDA.
As a Condition of Disbursement for the Demra Resettlement component, GOB will
confirm, with expert assistance, that development of a surface water source
for Dhaka's long-term water supply is appropriate and that Demra is a
satisfactory site for a water treatment plant. No other component of the
proposed Project is dependent on the outcome of these assessments and the
proposed Project focuses on the continued use of groundwater supplies.
II. BANK GROUP APPROACH TO THE SECTOR
A. Bank Group Objectives
2.01    The Bank Group's fundamental objective in the sector is to support
GOB in providing equitable and improved access to basic water supply and
sanitation services. This objective includes concern for the
cost-effectiveness of both capital investments and operations and
maintenance, and for the extension of coverage. In order to address these
concerns, the Bank has focused on three areas of potential improvements.
First, it has encouraged and assisted the development of effective sector
institutions. Parastatal organizations have been created with Bank Group
assistance in both Dhaka and Chittagong (DUASA and CWASA). These
organizations have been assisted in developing financial policies, manpower
development programs, accounting systems and operating procedures. Second,
the Bank has promoted long-term planning of capital investments. This
planning has focused on the identification of needs for expansion; the
constraints (both technical and financial) on capital investment; and the
recurrent requirements for financial and real resources implied by possible
investments. Third, the Bank has sought to strengthen financial discipline
and lessen reliance on limited sectoral resources through the direct recovery
of most costs through user charges. This is expected to motivate the control
of costs, to promote efficient use of water supply and sanitation services
and to increase the accountability of the WASAs to the public.
2.02    Since Bank financial support has been concentrated in Dhaka and
Chittagong, the Bank is particularly interested in the operational efficiency
of the two WASAs in these cities and their performance in recovering costs.



-7-
The operating and funding problems facing the WASAs anticipate the policy
issues that eventually will confront other cities in Bangladesh, and the
experience of the WASAs can benefit operations throughout the sector.
2.03    A study financed by Dutch Aid and conducted by consultants is
underway to strengthen the analytic basis for sector policies and priorities.
This study includes consideration of: (a) design standards and phasing of
investments, as determinants of overall capital requirements; (b) cumulative
operation and maintenance requirements (recurrent funds, staffing, etc.);
(c) affordability and cost recovery; and (d) the institutional development
strategy for the sector. The Bank has commented on the Terms of Reference
and the Draft Report of the study. Any further studies or pilot projects
required following this review would be financed by bilateral assistance,
UNDP and/or the IDA TechnicaL Assistance Credit; IDA would be invited to
comment on the Terms of Reference and findings of such assistance.
B. Bank Group Experience
2.04    The Bank Group has helped Bangladesh to finance four Projects in the
water supply and sanitation sector. The First Dhaka Project (Credit 368-BD,
1973) was approved in 1963 as Credit 41-PAK for US$26.0 million (later
reduced to US$13.0 million) and was the First Water Supply and Sanitation
Project financed by the Bank Group. Implementation of the Project was
delayed initially by bids which substantially exceeded estimated project
costs and then by political events culminating in Bangladesh's independence
from Pakistan. In order to adjust the scale of the Project to available
funds, in 196? the Project was reduced in scale and modified to rely on
groundwater, rather than surface water, as a source of supply. The revised
Project also strengthened and extended sewerage facilities. A Second Dhaka
Project (Credit 941-BD, 1979) provided US$20.5 million (net of a cancellation
of US$1.5 million in savings) which helped finance tubewells, water
distribution mains, elevated service reservoirs, service connections and
meters, sewers, workshops, vehicles, training and consulting services. A
First Project for Chittagong (Credit 42-PAK) was approved in 1963, revised in
1968 and then transferred to GOB following its independence. The revised
Project (Credit 367-BD, 1973) provided US$20 million to help finance
groundwater development, extension of the distribution system, metering and
technical assistance. The Second Chittagong Project (Credit 1001-BD for
US$20 million, 1980) is extending further distribution facilities, and
provides.a surface water treatment plant.
2.05    For the First Dhaka Project, as noted in the Project Performance
Audit Report (No. 3245, December 1980), water supply was increased
substantially and physical targets were basically met but institutional and
financial objectives were not fully achieved. In the Second Dhaka Project,
the physical works again have been implemented satisfactorily although delays
were experienced due to shortfalls in local GOB funding and to procurement
problems, which since have been corrected. The experieLce with the two



-8-
Chittagong Projects is similar. The achievement of full cost recovery has
been a key objective of the Dhaka and Chittagong Projects. Progress towards
this objective has been made by both DWASA and CWASA; they recover all
operating costs but are still unable to generate positive rates of return and
to cover debt service fully. The less than wholly satisfactory financial
performance is due primarily to WOB's refusal to authorize tariff increases
required to caopensate for inflation. Thes? refusals result from a lack of
full committment to the principle that the sector should be financially
viable. In addition, DWASA and CWASA have not achieve! fully the
efficiencies and performance standards projected at appraisals for the
operation and maintenance of completed facilities. These shortfalls derive
from delays in achieving financial reforms and from persistent problems in
staffing and institutional development.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
3.01    The purpose of the proposed Project is to improve DWASA's operational
and financial performance, to strengthen sectoral training and sectoral
planning, and to address immediate needs for additional supplies of water and
for sanitation services. Specific project objectives are to:
(a) continue the institutional development of DWASA emphasizing
operational efficiency, cost recovery and manpower development;
(b) develop further Dhaka's groundwater resources, in a cost-effective
way in order to increase the supply of potable water;
(c) expand distribution of water to areas where service is poor or
non-existent and maximize use of the system through additional
connections;
(d) strengthen DWASA's control of leakage and unaccounted-for qiater;
rehabilitate parts of Dhaka's water distribution system;
)  extend secondary sewers to areas in which conventional sewerage is
affordable in order to maximize use of the existing waterborne
sewerage system (which has underutilized trunk sewers and sewage
treatment capacity);
(g) develop an on-site sanitation program as a low-cost alternative to
waterborne sewerage;



-9-
(h) implement a pilot scheme (in conjunction with the United Nations
Centre for Human Settlements) to promote maintenance of public
standposts by users;
(i) resettle squatters on the proposed site of the surface water
treatment plant at Demra; and
(j) expand DIASA's Training Institute and extend training to other
agencies in the sector.
B. Rationale for Bank Group Participation
3.02    The rationale for continued Bank support to the water supply and
sanitation sector in Bangladesh and to DWASA derives from the contributions
that Bank assistance can make to the orderly and efficient development of the
sector. Water supply and sanitation are inescapably capital intensive and
sound analysis of investments and capital planning is very important. While
the technical alternatives for supplying these services are limited, economic
choices need to be made. The development of a pilot low-cost, on-site
sanitation program under the proposed Project is an example; this scheme
promises to meet the need for sanitary disposal of excreta at one-fifth of
less of the cost of conventional, waterborne sewerage. The choice of a
source of raw water from wells or a perennial river also has profound
economic and financial impLications. The Bank is helping DWASA define better
the analysis supporting these choices; it will also assist GOB in its
national capacicy to plan and to analyze such investments.
3.03    The present Project will continue the institutional development of
DWASA by further strengthening operational and financial management. As
DWASA (and CWASA) are the preeminent institutions in the sector, they provide
leadership on issues of policy and devise what will become model approaches
to such tasks as leak detection, metering, meter reading, bill collection and
staff develcpment. The Benk's involvement affords DWASA opportunities to
draw more extensively on the experiences of other countries.
C. Operational Action Plan
3.04    There are a number of interrelated project activities to be
undertaken by DWASA and other participating agencies. The Operational Action
Plan was finalized during Negotiations (Annex 3). This plan sets out the
activities that must be undertaken to ensure successful iamplementation of
capital investments and of changes in operational procedures. It identifies
the interrelationships among chese activities and the agencies that must
participate in their implementation. Assurances were received at
Negotiationa that during project implementation the Plan would be reviewed
annually and updated in a form satisfactory to IDA.



-10-
D. Project Description
3.05    The Project would upgrade and expand water supply and sanitation
facilities in Dhaka and the surrounding areas of Narayanganj, Tongi, Jinjira,
Joydebpur, and Savar; these works form part of the master plan for the long
term development of water supply and sanitation in Dhaka. Construction of
the next major expansion phase is envisaged for the 1990's (Annex 8). Both
new and replacement watermains proposed in this Project would be sized so
that they could be integrated into the distribution system regardless of
which long term source of supply is selected.
3.06    DWASA's current water production is estimated to be approximately 413
mld (para 1.10). It is obtained from 106 tubewells and one small (27 mld)
surface water treatment plant. On completion of the Third Dhaka Project,
production would reach about 465 mld as a result of comissioning additional
tubewells. Because the increase in production from the proposed Project is
modest and projected population is expected to grow rapidly, coverage is
predicted to decrease from 58Z of the population in FY86 to 57Z in FY90
(Annex 9). These projections are based upon estimates of metered and
non-metered domestic water consumption for connections serving an average of
22 persons each. Consumption through metered connections is estimated to be
about 130 lcd in FY86 and to decrease to about 120 lcd by FY95 due to tariff
increases and supply constraints. Consumption from non-metered connections
is estimated to be about 150 lcd and through standposts about 30 lcd.
3.07    The following components are included in the Project:
(a) construction of twenty-five tubewells (seven of which would
replace existing wells that are becoming choked with sand);
(b) installation of 144 km of watermains;
(c) rehabilitation of 123 km of existing watermains;
(d) installation of 37 km of new sewers and rehabilitation
of 23 km of existing sewers;
(e) instailation of 25,000 water connections (serving about 550,000
people) and 8,000 sewer connections (serving about 176,000 people);
connections;
(f) construction of 55 standposts and associated water lines in order
to serve about 11,000 people resident in the Old City and
the low income community of Shaheednagar;
(g) installation of an additional 10,000 water meters at production
wells, distribution branches and service connections;



-11-
(h) implementation of a comprehensive leak detection and repair program
to strengthen DWASA's effectiveness in reducing leakage and
unaccounted-for water;
(i) development of a low-cost sanitation program for DHC through a
thorough assessment of sanitation needs in Dhaka and a pilot Project
providing 4,000 units (serving about 88,000 people);
(j) procurement of 11 additional vehicles for DWASA's operation and
maintenance functions and five standby generators for emergency
power supply at tubewells;
(k) expansion of DWASA's training facilities to permit training of
staff from other sector agencies and to introduce programs on health
education;
(1) provision of technical assistance to DWASA to develop systems to
evaluate staff productivity and proposals for redeploying
underutilized staff resources;
(m) installation in DUASA of a computerized system for commercial
management and operational monitoring; and
(n) preparation of 33 hectares of land at Gandhrabpur for resettling
approximately 20,000 squatters from the site of the proposed Demra
water treatment plant, and provision of drains, wells, sanitation
facilities and access roads or pathways on the new site.
The following paragraphs describe in greater detail the more innovative and
strategically important components of the Project.
E. Low-Cost Sanitation
3.08    The Project will provide funds to develop and test the elements of a
low-cost csanitation program. In order to help impiement on-site sanitation
systems in Dhaka, DKC has created a low-cost sanitation cell under the direct
supeivision of the Chief Engineer, DNC. It is responsible for promoting the
concept; ensuring that minimal technical standards are maintained in the
production of manufactured elements (traps, pans, cisterns, etc.) and in
their installation; devising a system to assist households to finance the
investments; and providing maintenance (principally pit cleaning services).
The cell's efforts would build upon the technical research on low-cost
sanitation technologies conducted by the UNDP-World Bank Technology Advisory
Group, UNICEF and private voluntary organizations. The cell's activities
will focus on the development of institutional arrangem--nts and procedures
to implement these technologies on a city-wide scale.



-12-
3.09   The priority of this component derives from the fact that over the
next twenty years no more than 15% of Dhaka's population is expected to be
able to afford a centralized, waterborne sewerage system while on-site
sanitation is expected to be affordable to at least 80% of the population.
Assurances were received at Negotiations that DWASA will better utilize the
present sewerage system by making a target of 1,600 new sewerage connections
per year (Action Plan, Annex 3). The proposed low-cost sanitation pilot
Project will provide about 4,000 sanitary units (serving about 88,000
people). Consultants will develop and test approaches to meeting the
requirements for large-scale implementation of a program of on-site
sanitation. The pilot scheme will help identify the problems in future
implementation and help identify the optimal approach to providing low-cost
sanitation services. Assistance to the DMC cell will be provided by the
UNDP-World Bank Technology Advisory Group (TAG). DNC has prepared TORs for
the low-cost sanitation study and pilot Project has submitted them to IDA for
review; proposals will be requested by July 31, 1986 and consultants will be
engaged by October 31, 1986 to prepare and execute the component.
Implementation of the pilot program, to be identified during the study, will
begin by December 31, 1987 (Action Plan, Annex 3).
F. Leak Detection and Repair Program
3.10    The leak detection and repair component will strengthen DWASA's
capacity to identify and reduce physical losses from its water distribution
system and thereby increase the effective supply of water to customers. At
present, about 27% of production is unaccounted-for and is either being lost
through leakage or is being used illegally. An estimated one-third of
production is used by unmetered connections where consumption cannot be
accurately measured or billed. The problem of leakage could become more
acute when DWASA greatly increases the supply of water under the proposed
next phase of its expansion program and system pressures rise. A
comprehensive leak detection and repair program will be carried out under
this Project using consultants working closely with DWASA staff. One
objective of the program will be to establish operating procedures and
targets to reduce leakage and unaccounted-for water. To accurately measure
its production, DUASA needs to ensure that all its production meters are in
working order and calibrated; all meter repair or replacement should be done
before September 30, 1986, prior to commencement of the leak detection and
repair program (Action Plan, Annex 3).  Reduction of unaccounted-for water
and leakage will be addressed through identification of major system
leakages, conversion of connections from non-metered to metered, and
improvement in operations.  Assurances were received at Negotiations that
DWASA will meet the operating targets as established under the program. DWASA
has already prepared Terms of Reference for the leak detection and repair
program and will request proposals from consultants by June 15, 1986 and
engage the selected consultants by November 30, 1986 (Action Plan, Annex 3).
in view of the expanded program and need for higher standards of technical
supervision, DWASA has transferred responsibility for the waste reduction



-13-
cell and for the meter repair cell from the Co muercial Kanager to the Chief
Engineer. This organizational change within DWASA is indicated on the DUASA
organization chart in Annex 7.
3.11    Accurate plans of the greater Dhaka area, with the existing water
distribution network plotted, are needed before initiation of comprehensive
leak detection work. Base mapping of Dhaka, at scale 1:1,200, has been
acquired by DWASA and its staff is now preparing distribution system plans
for the areas to be addressed during the leak detection and repair program.
The plans will be completed by September 30, 1986. The remaining
distribution system plans will be completed by December 31, 1987, by the
consultants engaged to assist DWASA with project design.
G. Staff Productivity and Training
3.12    The Project provides for about 8 man-months of consultancy to more
fully analyze staff productivity and the deployment of staff resources, and
specifically to propose a system to monitor staff functions, and to define
workable incentives for operating staff. The purpose of this program will be
to improve the operational efficiency of DWASA and to define ways in which
training could improve performance. DWASA will submit TORs for the staff
productivity study to IDA for review by July 15, 1986 and will engage
consultants by October 15, 1986 (Action Plan, Annex 3).
3.13   The Project will also provide for the expansion of DIASA's Training
Institute (started under the Second Dhaka Project). Training will be offered
to other sectoral agencies and local bodies responsible for the operation and
maintenance of water supply facilities. In addition, courses will be
developed on health education to promote improvements in hygiene. The
detailed design of DWASA's medium-term training program (including curricula,
equipment requirements and overseas training for DWASA and sector staff),
will be proposed to IDA by June 15, 1986 (Action Plan, Annex 3). Staff from
IDA and IHO are assisting DWASA in reviewing its future training needs.
B. Demra Resettlement
3.14    Included in the Project is a component for resettlement of the
residents at Demra, the site for DVASA's proposed future water treatment
plant. This site was purchased in the 1960's as the Location for the surface
water treatment plant but has subsequently been settled by low-income
households; in 1972, the COB allowed an influx of people to set up shelters
on the site following the flooding of large areas of Dhaka. The proposed
resettlement program is intended to relocate about 20,000 squatters while
protecting fully their investment in shelter and community facilities. The
implementation of this component is contingent on a resolution of the issues
surrounding Dhaka's long-term water source (para 1.13).  Preliminary planning
for the resettlement component has been completed but further work has been
postponed until a decision can be reached on whether a plant at Demra is the
best solution. A nearby site at Gandhrabpur would be prepared and basic
infrastructure (drainage, sanitation, tubewells, access roads and core



-14-
housing) would be constructed. Candhrabpur is located 5 km upstream from
Deara and is easily accessible by local river transport. DUASA and involved
non-governmental organizations (VCO') prepared a detailed resettlement and
rehabilitation plan which is satisfactory to IDA and COS; it provides for
infrastructure, sites, core housing, comunity services, and other facilities
at Gandrabpur at a standard at least equal to those existing at Deara.
Requirements for filling and grading the Candhrabpur site are based on sound
engineering principles. Local consultants would be engaged by DWASA to carry
out the detailed engineering and drainage design in order to ensure that
filling is done to levels secure from probable flooding as determined from
analyses of historical river flow data.
3.15    CONCURN, an GO, has offered DUASA its help in supervising the
development of the resettlement site. CONCERN has been assisting the Dears
community for several years and expects to continue its involvement through a
health care and education program at the new site. Another ECO, World
Vision, would assist DWASA in coordinating the social aspects of the
resettlement.
3.16    The cost of the resettlement component would be borne by GOB and
administered as a grant by DVASA, which would be responsible for the
component's implementation. GOB's Housing and Settlements Directorate would
assist DWASA with construction activities. The resettle ment site and related
works would not become part of DIASA's assets and DEASA would not be
responsible for the mintenance of the new coamunity, which would become part
of the existing local Upazila. As a Condition of Disbursement for the
resettlement component, GO4, with expert assistance, would have to confirm
that the development of a surface water source is the appropriate nezt stage
in DWASA's long-term development plan and that Deor is a satisfactory site
for the water treatment plant (para 1.12). If the resettlement proceeds,
D-ASA would prepare and furnish to IDA by December 31, 1986, a detailed
timetable for implementating the resettloemnt and rehabilitation program
(Action Plan, Annex 3). Assurances were received at Negotiations, that DVASA
would engage an organization, satisfactory to IDA to monitor and evaluate
implementation of the resettlement progrm.
IV. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING AMD INPLREKNTATION
A. Project Cost Estimates
4.01    The Project is estimated to cost Taka 1,285 million (US$41.4 million)
including contingencies, duties and taxes. Physical contingencies amount to
about US$2.9 million, price contingencies to about US$9.7 million and duties
and taxes to about US$7.9 million. A su  ry cost table for project
components, with a breakdown of local and foreign costs, is shown in



-15-
Table 4.1. Estimated annual expenditures are shown in Annx 1. Base costs
for both tables are as of January 1, 1986.
4.02    The costs of civil works are based on preliminary designs and
prevailing rates for construction. Material and equip ment costs are based on
estimates from langladeshi and foreign suppliers, and on recent supply
contracts. Physical contingencies have b een calculated at 102 of the base
cost for both civil works and mterials and equipment. Price contingencies
for local and foreign costs have been projected as follows:
Fiscal Year             Local Costs             Foreign Costs
1986/87                  12.0S                    6.3Z
1987/88                  10.O1                    7.8K
1988189                  10.01                    8.0S
1989/90                  10.O2                    8.0S
1990/91                  10.OZ                    8.0S
1991/92 onwards          10.02                    8.0Z
B. Financing Plan
4.03    The Project will be financed by G0O and IDA.  The funds will be
passed to the implemmuting agencies as loans (602), equity contribution (262)
and grants (142). An IDA Credit of US$30.0 million, representing about 9O0
of the total project cost of US$41.4 million, net of duties and taxes, will
cover 10OZ of the project foreign exchange costs and about 62Z of local costs
net of duties and tazes. GOB will finace the remaining project costs.
Assurances were received at Negotiations that @O3 will make available over
five years all funding required for project iuplemontation through timly
allocations from the Annual Developmet PLan (ADP) under the Third Five-Year
Plan, which is still in draft. If the allocation to the water supply and
sanitation sector remains at 2.42 of the total plan, as in the Second Plan,
and is adjusted for inflation, the Project will reprsent about one-third of
Plan expenditures for the sector. Assurances were received at Negotiations
that COB will finance the Dsira Resettlement component through a Government
grant, funded 852 from  the IDA Credit. GMB also confir m   at Negotiations
that it will on-lend the rest of the IDA Credit funds to DIUSA an D C for
the water and sanitation components and will provide the balance of financing
required by WASA (about US$10 million) as a Covernmeut equity contribution.
The IDA Credit will be utilized 16S as grant and 842 as loan.

C. On-lending Terms
4.05    It was confirmed at Negotiations that GOB will on-lend funds to DWASA
and to DKC (for implementation of the low-cost sanitation component) at an
11.5Z annual rate of interest. The loan will be amortized over 20 years in
equal annual payments from DWASA and DMC to GOB. Repayment will follow a
five-year grace period for the principal and interest payments, during which
time the interest will be capitalized and added to the principal amount. The
on-lending rate is expected to be positive in real terms, and to equal the
sum of the prevailing long-term international interest rate of about 9% per
annum plus expected depreciation (in the near term) of the Taka of about
2-2.5% per annum. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by COB.



-18-
D. Status of Project Preparation
4.06    The water supply and sewerage components of this Project were
identified in a development plan and feasibility study completed in 1984 by
DIASA and its engineering consultants. The engineering of the Project is
well conceived and the proposed schemes represent least cost solutions
(para 7.01). The base reference for preparation of this Project was the 1981
report of the long-term development plan and feasibility study carried out by
engineering consultants engaged by DWASA. Further consultancy is required to
assist DIASA with the detailed design of water supply and sewerage
facilities. Terms of Reference have been prepared for this assistance and
consultants will be appointed by July 1, 1986 (Action Plan, Annex 3).
Design could progress very rapidly, since over the project implementation
period numerous relatively small contracts would be awarded for construction
of vatermains, severs and tubewells. The design work and bid documents
required for civil works to be constructed during the first year of
implementation have already been completed by DMASA engineering staff. It is
estimated that about 15Z of the contracts will be awarded during the first
year. DMASA has indicated the need to order materials for this Project as
soon as possible to avoid any implementation delays. Therefore, it has been
agreed that retroactive financing under the Credit of up to US$3.0 million
will be available to DWASA. Since the materials requirements have been
identified in sufficient detail, bidding documents for the initial materials
contracts are ready for tendering now. Land already has been acquired for 21
of the 25 new tubewells.
E. Procurement and Contracts
4.07    Equipment and material contracts valued at US$20.5 million will be
awarded t'.der International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with IDA
guidelines. Only cement and reinforcing steel will be awarded under Local
Competitive Bidding (LCB), since limited quantities of the materials are
required and local prices are competitive. Katerial contracts totalling
about US$0.4 million will be awarded under LCB procedures, with individual
contracts expected to range from US$0.05 million to US$0.20 million.
4.08    As in the first two Projects, all civil works (consisting mostly of
watermains, sanitary sewers and tubewells) of aggregate value US$13.2 million
will be carried out through a number of relatively small contracts. These
works, wbich are limited in scope, require no special equipment or techniques
and are well suited to the labor-intensive ethods employed by the local
contracting industry. For these reasons, ICB is not considered appropriate.
It was confirmed at Negotiations, that for all project procurement, IDA
guidelines will be adhered to.  Civen the Condition of Disbursenmr.t for the
Demra resettlement component (par& 3.16), the costs of civil works and
materials for this component have been identified as separate items from the
rest of the Project. Dredge-filling of the ncw site (about US$2.8 million)



-19-
accounts for about half the Dears resettlement component cost and will be
done on force account by GOB, which carries out all dredging activities in
Bangladesh.
4.09    In evaluating bids for equipment and materials, domestic
manufacturers will be given a preferential margin equal to 15X of the CIF
costs of the competing imports, or the existing rate of customs duty,
whichever is lower.  A summary of material and equipment requirements for the
Project and tentative contract packages are shown in Annex 10. All ICB and
LCB materials and equipment contracts (approximately 15), and civil works
contracts worth over US$100,000 equivalent, will be subject to IDA's prior
review of invitation to bid, bidding documents and proposed awards and final
contracts. Approximately, 80X of the total estimated contract value will be
subject to IDA's prior review. All other contracts will be subject to random
post review by IDA after contract award. The consulting services will be
obtained in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for the use of consultants.
Procurement arrangements are sumarized in Table 4.3.

F. Implementation
4.10    As in the first two Dhaka Projects, DUASA will be the implementing
agency for the water supply and sewerage components. Ownership of all
project works, except for those created under the low-cost sanitation and the
Demra Resettlement components, will rest with DWASA. Since the works are
similar to those constructed under the First and Second Projects, DWASA will
require less assistance from outside consultants. Consultancies (from local
firms assisted by advisors from international firms) will be required for the
detailed design of watermains and sewers, and for the preparation of bidding
documents. The DWASA technical staff are sufficiently qualified and
experienced to supervise the construction. The low-cost sanitation component
will be implemented by DMC, with advisory assistance from the UNDP/Morld Bank
Technical Advisory Group (TAG), which has had considerable experience in this
area (para 3.08).
4.11    The entire Project will be implemented over a period of five years.
This implementation period is consistent with the experience of the Second
Dhaka Project, which corresponded to the proposed Project in both size and
scope. Substantial delays which occurred early in the Second Project due to
lack of counterpart financing are not expected to recur. The tubewells,
watermains, sewers and rehabilitation work envisaged under the Third Project
are very similar to works carried out previously by DWASA and are part of
DIASA's on-going development program. Also, through the previous Projects,
DWASA has experience in IDA procurement procedures. There are not expected
to be any unusual engineering problems or delays. The local capacity for
construction has proved adequate in the earlier Projects. The low-cost
sanitation units represent relatively simple technology and construction
requirements. Installation of watermains, sewers and sanitation units will
continue to be carried out using labor-intensive methods. The estimated
schedule for project implementation is given in Annex 6.
C. Disbursement
4.12    The proceeds of the Credit are expected to be fully disbursed over a
five and one-half year period. Retroactive financing (para 4.06) will be
available under the Project and effective start-up of Project procurement
will begin about six months before the start of disbursements. About 22 of
the Credit (US$0.6 million) is expected to be disbursed during the twelve
month period following project completion. An estimated disbursement
schedule is shown in Annex 2, and the estimated amounts of credit disburse-
ment and disbursement percentages, by category, are shown in Table 4.4.
Applications for disbursement will be fully documented except for civil works
contracts costing less than US$20,000 each and the dredging costs for the
Demra resettlement site (performed on force account) which will be disbursed
against Statements of Expenditure (SOE); the documentation will be retained
by DWASA for inspection by supervision missions. The standard IDA procedures
for auditing SOE's will apply (para 6.22). In order to facilitate
disbursements, a Special Project Account will be established in the Central



-21-
Bank of Bangladesh on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. The initial
deposit in the Bangladesh Bank will be US$2.0 million.

H. Project Reporting and Supervision
4.13    DWASA has already established, under the Second Project, a
satisfactory  onitoring and reporting system for its quarterly reports to
IDA. These reports include information on the physical, financial, technicat
and institutional aspects of the Project. DUASA has adopted a revised format
for Project monitoring which includes prcject targets and performince norms.
DWASA has established a Project Monitoring and Evaluation Division (PIED)
which has gained ezperience in monitoring the Second Project. Under this
Project, a computer vill be provided to assist in collecting and analyzing
data and in managing billing and collections (paras 6.07-6.09). By July
15, 1986, DWASA will submit T7Es for installation of a computer system to
IDA for review and by December 31, 1986, DWASA will request proposals and
select a computer system (Action Plan, Annez 3). It is estimated that about
65 staff-weeks of IDA supervision will be required during impleoentation of
the Project.
I. Insurance
4.14    Assurances were received at Negotiations that DVASA would take out
and maintain insurance with responsible insurers, or make other provisions
satisfactory to IDA for insurance, against such risks and in such samunts as
is consistent with appropriate practice.
V.  PROJECT INLENAENTATIN GENCIES
A. The Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority
5.01    The DUASA was established in 1963 to construct, operate and mintain
water supply and sewerage works in Dhaka. DUASA is managed by a Board of
Directors appointed by COB; the Chairmn of the Board also acts as DHASA's
Chief Executive. The organization chart is shrvn in Annex 7. DVASA is
divided into Engineering, Comsercial and Administration Departments and six
Central Service Divisions. All Departments and Central Divisions, including
Training, Planning and Ponitoring, report directly to the Chairman. For
administrative purposes, Dhaka is divided into siz zones in which
subdivisions operate.   Engineering Operations are divided into four
divisions: Planning and Design; Construction and Development; Maintenance
and Distribution; and Repair& and Equipament. The current organi:ationrl
structure functions satiifactorily.
5.0;    DUASA's total staff has grown from 1,800 in 1979 (at the coomencement
of the Second Project) to about 2,400 employees now. Since the staffing
levels have r ma ined relatively high in relation to the scale of operations
and since wages equal about one-third of direct operating costs, closer



-23-
assessment of staff resources and of their deployment is warranted. Thus, a
Staff Productivity Study is included in this Project (para 3.12). The study
will identify ways of improving operational efficiency which in the long
term, will reduce staffing to more efficient levels. DVASA is mandated to
operate as a commercial enterprise; it owns assets and seeks to recover both
its capital and operating costs and generate a moderate Rate of Return.
However, during much of its history, DWASA has been unable to accomplish
these goals both because COB has not allowed it to increase tariffs to
reflect inflation and real price risen, and because its operations have been
somewhat inefficient. Financing of DWASA's assets is provided through COB
loans and equity contributions; long term loans represent only about 45Z of
the capital structure. DWASA's finances are discuased in greater detail in
Chapter VI.
5.03    From the experience of working closely with consultants on the two
previous Projects, DWASA's Engineering Department has developed its own
capability to carry out routine design of watersains and sewers. Until
recently, DVASA has lost many experienced staff to employent in the Middle
East. This problem now causes less of a drain and the staff is more stable.
The staff, however, still requires some technical support. During this
Project, DWASA will engage engineering consultants to assist with detailed
design and for the development of DIASA staff's design capabilities.
5.04    During the first two Projects, training was provided to DWASA staff,
both in Bangladesh and abroad. DWASA's operating staff was trained at an
in-house training center financed under the Second Project. The facility
offers training to the staff of CWASA as well. Although some problems have
been encountered in hiring experienced trainers, the center has been very
successful and over 400 staff have benefitted from its courses. During the
Third Project, DWASA will expand its training program to become the central
sector training facility for Bangladesh (para 3.13).
5.05    DIASA's Commercial Department was reorganized under the Second
Project, and new billing and collection procedures were introduced with the
assistance of consultants. Qualified accouaitants and revenue officers were
also added to the staff. Improvement will continue during the Third Project
with introduction or a compaterized billing system. DVASA's financial
accounts are prepared on a comiercial basis and are satisfactory.
5.06    DVASA will implement the project water and sewerage works
(par 4.10), and operate and maintain the facilities.  The engineering staff
of DVASA is well qualified to manage implementation of this Project, drawing
oan the experience gained in the first two Projects. DWASA's current
operating performance will be stren_.;.ened through consultancies to analyze
water leakage and wastage, and deployment of staff resources. Much of
DIASA's major production facilities and system extensions have been
constructed since the early 1960's; they are in good condition and do not
require a high degree of maintenanee. There are, however, facilities in the
Old City and some taken over by DUASA (from other agencies) which are now in



-24-
poor condition. For these, the rehabilitation components of this Project
will provide needed assistance to help DWASA to improve service levels by
reducing leakage and infiltration.
B. The Dhaka Municipal Corporation
5.07    The DMC was established under an Ordinance in 1963.  The Engineering,
Finance and Administrative Departments report to a Chief Administrative
Officer. The DMC is required to provide an array of urban services such as
public health and sanitation, maintenance of public infrastructure and
education. It is also directed to undertake town planning activities and
development works. COB Ministries assist the DMC in providing roads, power,
drainage and education. It is estimated that about 15Z of DMC's revenues
come from property-based taxes; about 25Z from rates and fees; and about 602
from GOB grants to help cover capital and operating ezpenditures. Property
taxes are based on the Annual Rental Value (ARV) which is greatly undervalued
and is politically difficult to change. Despite a reassessment in 1985 that
increased the ARV by an average of 1001, the assessed ARV is still only about
one-third of actual market values.
5.08    To implement the low-cost sanitation component, DMC has set up a
low-cost sanitation cell, to be administered by an Executive Engineer under
the Chief Engineer. As noted in para 3.08, the cell would be assisted by
the UNDP-World Bank Technology Advisory Group. Procedures for expanding the
pilot s,..heme into a larger citywide sanitation program would be developed
under the Project with the help of consultants.
VI. DVASA FINANCES
6.01   Throughout the 1980's, DWASA has experienced income deficits.  In
FY84 and FY85, DWASA reported a negative (1Z) ROR, although the debt service
coverage remained above 1.5. The water tariff was increased by about 25Z in
June 1985, ane DWASA is now projecting a 01 ROR for FY86. DWASA's capital
position is strong, with only about 45Z of capitalization financed by
long-term debt. The Authority revalued its assets in 1982 and all the
financial statements in this appraisal report as well as the Project
financial targets are based on the 1982 asset revaluation. Contributing to
DIASA's inadequate financial results have been: (a) production and
distribution inefficiency; (b) insufficient metering; (c) a low level of
revenue collections; and (d) low tariff rates.
6.02    System leakages and illegal usage account for about 272 of production
that is not billed; another one-third of production is consumed through
unmetered connections, which are charged at subsidized rates. DWASA has also
suffered cash flow problems from large collection arrears and some
under-billing of accounts.



-25-
6.03    DIASA management accepts the need to improve its operational
efficiency and this Project helps to address that need. With successful
implementation of the leak detection program (para 3.10) and metering program
(para 6.05) by 1995, leakage and illegal usage could be reduced to about
20% of production and distribution of water through unmetered connections to
IO of production. Gradually, the financial burden on consumers due to
inefficiency should diminish. However, to pay for improved service and for
adequate maintenance and to account for inflation, DWASA will require regular
tariff increases and vigorous bilLing and collection. Currently, tariffs are
revised infrequently - only when they fall 25Z to 40X behind cost increases.
A. Metering
6.04    Nearly one-half of the domestic connections are currently unmetered.
All unmetered consumption is billed at 17.5Z of the Annual Rental Value (ARV)
(para 5.07). Based on sample metering of unmeterL.s connections and an
analysis of associate1 water bills, unmetered consumption is billed at about
50% of the current tariff rates.
6.05    Twenty-five thousand water meters were purchased under the Second
Project but due to procurement delays, unmetered connections increased to
about two-thirds of total connections in 1983. Now, DWASA has reduced the
number of nonmetered connections to one-half of the total, but 30,000
delivered meters are still to be installed and 10,000 more are to be procured
under the Third Pro'act. Assurances were received at Negotiations that all
new water connections will be metered with a target of 4,000 new connections
per year, and that unmetered connections will be converted with a target of
3,000 connections per year.
6.06   The accuracy of both production and retail meters needs improvement
and better monitoring. The Second Dhaka Project provided a meter repair and
calibration shop, and consaltancy services to strengthen metering and meter
reading. The proposed Third Project will introduce rigorous computerized
monitoring of ceter performance and of meter readings in order to improve the
accuracy of metering, billing and collections. It is important that arrears
not escalate as DWASA's billings increase through higher tariffs and correct
metering.
B. Billing and Collections
6.07    Under the Second Project, DWASA reorganized its commercial department
and hired an expatriate commercial manager to introduce procedures to improve
the billing and collections. DWASA recently increased the frequency of its
billings and now 951 of private (non-government) connections are receiving
bills at least once every two months. Collections, however, remain
problematic. Collections of private accounts are on average 6 months in
arrears (down from 12 months in 1984).



-26-
6.08    DVASA has started a program to disconnect accounts which are over
siz moths in arrears and to monitor illegal reconnections. In addition, the
bill collectors now are being rotated annually to lessen the likelihood of
fraudulent under-billing of accounts. Readings are being checked randomly by
DUASA management as a fu:ther control on the integrity of the meter reading
system. Assurances were received at Negotiations that at least 95Z of
connections will continue to be billed once every two onths and that
accumulated arrears of DWUAA's private billings, net of arrears over four
years old (which should be written off) and net of arrears on disconnected
accounts, will not exceed the equivalent of six months' billings from
FY87 onwards.
6.09    GOB payments are dirficult for DWASA to enforce.  Except for the
public standpost charge, which GOB pays semi-annually on behalf of the Dhaka
Municipality, payments for GOB Departments and housing colonies are made very
irregularly. Government charges represent about 13S of DIASA's current
billings and accumulated arrears equal about 10 months billings or
Taka 20 million. Assurances were receii-ed at Negotiations that GOB will pay
all water bills due DVASA for public standposts, GOB Departments and housing
colonies so that GOB accumulated arrears will not exceed the equivalent of
si months' billings. As a Condition of Board Presentation, GOB will pay to
DVAS.i all outstanding Government arrears due as of January 1, 1986 (Action
Plan, Annex 3).
C. Tariffs
6.10   Water tariffs have been raised once every 3 or 4 years usually at
IDA's insistence. 1/ The sewerage charge is assessed at 1OOZ of the water
bill and therefore rises with increases in the watee rate. 2I Tariffs
increased only 45Z between 1980 and 1985 while the general price level rose
by about 80Z. Over the same period, unit operating costs for water supply
(excluding depreciation) increased by nearly 401 in real terms due to the
rapid rise in energy and wage costs relative to general inflation.
FY86 revenues are projected to cover all operating, maintenance and overhead
costs and almost all of depreciation. But for the first time in the 1980s,
DVASA will be unable to cover the full debt service obligation (751 coverage
is projected), due to the start of pay-back for the Second Project Loan.
Substantial increases in the water tariff will be implemented at the
beginning of the Third Project (para 6.15).
1/ A 251 tariff increase was introduced in June 1985 as a Condition of
Appraisal for this Project.
2/ Current sewerage revenues are estimated to cover all associated cost's
(para 1.12).



-27-
6.11 The present tariff structure distinoguishes only two rates -
residential and non-residential. Theise rates are applied regardless of the
quantity consumed. The domestic tariff was designed to be affordable to the
lowest income household served by a house cornection, and is substantially
less than the cost of producing the service.  The resulting absolute subsidy
is larger for wealthier residential customers who consume large quantities of
water per capita. Although industrial, commercial and COB connections are
billed at a rate over three times that for domestic supplyp the volume
consumed is relatively small and thus the cross-subsidy to the residential
sector equals only about 15X of domestic revenues.
6.12    The introduction of a 'progressive block' tariff in Dhaka has been
rejected on the grounds that low-income households would be penalized.
Poorer houbeholds frequently live under a joint-family system, and therefore
consume large volumes per connection even though consimption per capita is
low. The introduction of a computerized billing system may offer the
opportunity to reexamine the administrative fensibility for alternative
tariff structures (para 4.13).
D. Tariff Adjustment Clause for Power Costs
6.13    Because tariff increases have been late and irregular, it has become
difficult for DWASA to operate on a co mercial basis.  The authority to
modify tariffs to reflect increases in electricity charges is needed bezause
power represents about 2/3 of the direct cost of operations and maintenance
for DVASA, and thus increases in power rates seriously affect its finmacial
position. DVASA and COB have agreed to a Tariff Adjust ment Clause for Power
Cost, analogoue to the Fuel Adjustment Clause allowed to the Power
Development Board. As s Condition of Effectiveness, GOB will take all
necessary steps to enable DWASA to implement the Clause. The proposed change
would allow DWASA, without prior Government approval, to increase water
tariffs by up to 10Z over any 12 month period in order to cover any increase
in power costs for the production and distribution of water. Thus, it would
permit routine, modest tariff increases and reduce the need for very large
increases every few years.
E. DWASA Financial Targets
6.14    The Project's financial objective is for DWASA to achieve full cost
recovery within the limits of affordability to consumers. The Project's
financial targets require DUASA to cover fully all operating, maintenance and
overhead costs and debt service, and to achieve at least a 3Z 3RO from
FY87-MY9O and a 5Z 10 from MY91-Y9S. Assurances were received at
Negotiations that these targets will be in effect from FY87 onwards. A 3Z
ROR on the assets revalued in 1982 is roughly equivalent to a 5Z ROR on
non-revalued assets as required under the Second Project.



-28-
6.15    As shown in the projections (Annez 4), DUASA can achieve these
targets for the Project with tariffs that increase by an average of about
5Z a year from PY88, if operating efficiency improves to the expected levels.
However, substantial increases will be required for FY87 and FY88 to
compensate for the lack of adequate tariff increases over the past few years.
Implementation of a least a 25Z tariff increase is a Condition of Board
Presentation. Assurances were received at Negotiations that a further
201 tariff increase would be implemented by July 1, 1987.
6.16    Analysis indicates that the tariffs required to meet the project
targets would be within affordability limits for DWASA's connected consumers
(para 6.21). With the power adjustment clause (para 6.13), most of the
average yearly tariff increases required from FY88-FY95 will be implemented
automatically.
6.17    For the Second Project, about 50X of DWASA's capical costs were
financed through loans, and COB contributed 502 as equity. DWASA will have a
higher degree of self-financing under the Third Project; DWASA's loan portion
will increase to 72Z of DWASA's project costs and its equity contribution
will be reduced to 281. In achieving the financial targets, DWASA will also
generate sufficient cash to maintain a cash fund equivalent to at least five
months' operating costs, and to cover minor, routine investments outside the
Project. These investments will include nine tubewells to be constructed
from FY9O-FY95 in order to maintain production levels. By FY95, DWASA's cash
account will contain about US$3 million (1985 terms).
6.18    DWASA's finances cannot be projected and financial targets set beyond
1995, until Dhaka's long-term water source is selected (para 1.13) and its
phasing and costs are determined. The present analysis is based on tubewells
as the water source. Investments in tubewells have a very short gestation
period and the corresponding increment in capacity can be utilized almost
iiediately.  However, if development of a water treatment plant is pursued,
a very large addition to capacity would be provided, and a large asset and
debt burden would be added to DNASA's balance sheet all at once. The impact
of these factors on present cost recovery targets will need to be thoroughly
analyzed.
P. DNASA Financial Projections
6.19    DWASA Financial Projections for FY86-FY95, and the assumptions
utilized in developing them, are given in Annexes 4 and 5. The projections
reflect inflationary increases in costs, a modest (12X) increase in
production, and the improvements in operating efficiency, billings and
collections that are expecE3d to be achieved --der the Project.  Chief among
these improvements will be the reduction in unbilled water, achieved mainly
through an accelerated metering program (para 6.05) and a leak detection
program (pars 3.10). A conservative risk factor is built into the financial



-29-
projections by assuming that bad debts are equal to 10 of bilLed revenues
in FY85-87, declining to 72 of billed revenues by FY95.
6.20    DWASA's debt service requirement increases substantially in FY86
(with the start of repayments on the Second Project Loan) and still further
in FY91 with the repayments of the Third Project Loan. The loans from the
IDA Credits are the only long-term debts on DWASA's Balance Sheet and they
equal no more than 452 of DWASA's capital structure throughout the Project
period. In order to meet financial targets nominal tariffs must increase
from FY88 onwards by an average coupoinded rate of about 5Z a year; this rate
is less than inflation because of the incremental revenue expected to be
generated from operating efficiencies. The net fixed assets account is
projected to increase by 462 from FY86-FY89, but then to rise only by 42 up
to FY95; this stability helps the ROR to be maintained with moderate tariff
increases. The operating ratios remain stable from FY87-FY95, varying from
0.77-0.84. The projections are most sensitive to the levels of metered
billings and direct costs; for each, a change of 1Z would affect the ROR by
about 0.12 and debt service coverage by .01. If the average tariff were to
increase by about 62 per year rather than about 52, the ROR would rise by
0.12 in FY88 and by 1.52 in FY95. A summary of DWASA's financial projections
is given in Table 6.1

G. Affordability
6.21    The affordability of tariffs projected under the Third Project has
been analyzed and found to be acceptable. Households will be able to consume
water in the same quantities as they did in 1984, at an average cost of
between 2.5Z and 3.5Z of household income.  The lower of these percentages
applies to households with incomes in 1984 of less than Taks 1,000 a month.
(Quantities demanded vary with household incomes). The average household in
Dhaka spends about two-thirds of its disposable income on food; the remaining
third is divided into roughly equal parts for shelter, clothing and other
expenses. Thus water supply represents about a quarter of household
expenditures for shelter and related services. If incomes rise with
inflation, the share of incomes required to pay for water supply and sewerage
service would decline by 40X over the next 10 years. Thus, in 1995, all
income classes would spend less than 2Z of income on water supply and the
poorest third of connected households would spend less than 1.51.
Introduction of a progressive tariff structure that imposed higher charges on
high volume users (para 6.12) would permit greater cross-subsidization and
thereby reduce the cost to low income households. A progressive tariff also
would discourage the very high rates of use now prevalent among the
wealthiest consumers.
H. Accounts, Audits and Submission of Financial Statements and Quarterly
Progress Reports
6.22    Under the First and Second Projects, DWASA has been required to
maintain commercial accounts which are audited by independent commercial
auditors acceptable to IDA. Wher IDA reimbursements are requested through
Statements of Expenditure, the auditors are required to certify that
underlying files and data fully support the requests for disbursement.
DWASA's audited financial statements are supposed to be submitted to IDA
within six months of the end of its fiscal year, June 30. Separate accounts
of project expenditures are submitted with the quarterly project progress
reports (para 4.13). DWASA's audits are up-to-date and generally have been
of satisfactory quality; the underlying accounts have improved and have
reached a satisfactory standard during the last few years. However, the
accounts have been submitted to IDA 2-4 months late.  Assurances were
received at Negotiations that the accounting and audit provisions for DVASA,
as under the Second Project, will be continued in all respects except that
the audit reports can be submitted to IDA within nine months of the end of
the fiscal year.
6.23    For the low-cost sanitation component, which is to be implemented by
DXC, assurances were received at Negotiations that accounts of project
expenditures will be maintained by DHC and audited by the Controller and
Auditor General, GOB, and submitted to IDA within nine months of the end of
the fiscal year.



-31-
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Least-Cost Solution and Evaluation of Alternatives
7.01    DWASA's engineering consultants have examined the technically
feasible alternatives for supplying and distributing water and have selected
the least costly alternative. The options for supply in the long term are a
surface water treatment plant or tubewells located at intervals to avoid
interference with one another. The surface water sys:em would require a very
large initial investment (over US$100 million) but would have relatively
modest operating costs. This system is most economically scaled to meet
needs for about twenty years. Tubewells can be implemented in modestly sized
increments capable of meeting the growth in demand for six to eight months.
In addition, since a number of dispersed sources are being employed, the
transmission mains for a tubewell system may be smaller in diameter and thus
less expensive to construct. However, the tubewell-system requires much
greater unit expenditures for energy to lift the water from the aquifer.
7.02    At real interest rates of 8X to 10X per annum, the least-cost
alternative is highly sensitive to projections of energy costs. If the price
of electricity remains stable, a tubewell system i.. preferable. However, if
electricity prices increase at rates experienced in the late 1970's and early
1980's, the surface water system would be more cost-effective. The design
and construction of a major surface water treatment plant would require at
least six years while the construction of individual tubewells could be
accomplished within a year.
7.03    The current trends in energy prices make tubewells the least costly
water supply alternative. Since the initial capital investments in tubewells
are relatively small, future Projects have the fLexibility to elect either
source. Given the excess demand in Dhaka, tubewells and associated
transmission lines can help meet that demand quickly and be fully utilized as
soon as they are operational.
7.04    Distribution systems have been designed to minimize the present value
of the cost of delivering water to customers over the infinite future. The
calculations have been based on a real interest rate (discount rate) of
8Z a year; this implies that pipes should be sized to meet maximum demands
for 15-20 years depending on assumptions regarding growth in population and
in per capita consumption. Distribution storage has not been included in
this Project because the additional supplies of water to be provided would
still not be sufficient to meet demand and service would continue to be
intermittent. Therefore, in the medium term, supplies would not be adequate
to fill even the existing storage tanks which were designed to balance
distribution flows. The choice of water supply from tubewells permits the
Project to rely upon smaller diameter transmission lines; if the large
surface water treatment plant is chosen in the future, these lines would have
a



-32-
to be linked by ring mains. The proposed Project would not materially alter
the need for such modification and thus would be nearly independent of any
future decision to develop surface water.
B. Marginal Cost
7.05    The marginal cost of water supplied under this Project is below the
average cost of supply. Investments in tubewells will be phased to ensure
that they are used fully almost immediately. At market prices, the marginal
cost of water supplied is Taka 1.86 per cu m at a real discount rate of 8%
and Take 2.07 per cu m at a real rate of 10%. Using the border pricing
method of determining the economic cost of resources, the marginal cost of
water is estimated to be Taka 1.60 per cu m at a real discount rate of 8S a
year and Taka 1.78 per cu m at 10%. The tariff rate for residential
consumers is Taka 1.93 per. co m and for commercial and industrial customers
is Taka 6.27 per cu m; the average tariff in 1985 was Taka 2.45 per cu m.
C. Impact on Poverty Groups
7.06    This Project is designed to relieve the present shortage of safe
water and to help meet the increases in demand that are expected to accompany
future growth of the population of Dhaka. It would improve the supply of
water throughout the city and would serve all income groups. In 1984,
average per capita income in the city of Dhaka was estimated to be about
Taka 320 (US$10.30) a month. The poverty threshold, based on World Bank
guidelines, is estimated to be US$7.58 a month. About three-quarters of the
population, and of Project beneficiaries, had a per capita monthly income
of less than Taka 240 (US$7.75). The diet of the average person in this
latter group provided about two-thirds of the recommended minimum calories.
The poverty group defined by either of these methods is expected to consume
about 601 of the total volume of water supplied to households. It is
estimated that 661 of project costs would be utilized to serve the poverty
group. The low-cost sanitation component (para 3.08) is intended to develop
a program for delivery of on-site waste disposal. It would benefit directly
about 88,000 people who would receive sanitary latrines; in addition the
component would establish the basis for a future sustainable program to serve
the whole of Dhaka.
D. Environmental Health Impact
7.07    Very rapid population growth has led to serious crowding and
unhygienic conditions in Dhaka. The water supply component of the Project
would help DWASA to expand the supply of safe water to meet growing demand.
The low-cost sanitation component would introduce much needed improvements in
sanitary conditions to areas which cannot afford waterborne sewerage.
Through the training components (para 3.13), DWASA would develop a public
health education program to promote the use of sanitary facilities.



-33-
E. Project Risks
7.08    The technical design of this Project minimizes financial and economic
risks by specifying the construction of tubewells in response to observed
growth in demand. Tubewells in Bangladesh have failed in the past because of
obstruction of the well screen by fine sand particles that move through the
aquifer, usually due to overpumping. Technical assistance is being provided
under the Project to optimize the development of the aquifer and to help
select well screens in order to minimize the risk of tubewell failure. DWASA
has had satisfactory experience in procuring materials under ICB and LCB,
constructing similar type tubewells and using local contractors under the
previous Projects. The Project is of similar size and scope to the previous
one. There are no special technical difficulties and Project technical risks
are rated low. Thus, implementation is not expected to present any unusual
problems to the Authority.
7.09    The financing of operations and maintenance would be improved under
the Project through greater control of costs and revenues. However, there is
a risk that operating efficiency may not improve as quickly as expected.
Efforts have been made to establish reaListic targets and estimates in
consultation with DWASA engineers and to prepare conservative financial
projections. Nonetheless, failure to approve tariff increases in response to
inflation would pose some risk that DWASA would not have sufficient resources
to operate and maintain properly its assets. Large tariff increases of
25Z in both 1985 and 1986 have been required as Conditions of Project
Appraisal and Credit Effectiveness; a further tariff increase of 20S is
covenanted for 1987. With these increases, DWASA is expected to meet project
financial targets. Projections show that after 1986, with expected
improvements in efficiency, only moderate yearly adustments to the tariffs
would be necessary.
F. Project Justification and Economic Rate of Return
7.10    The primary aims of this Project are to strengthen further the Dhaka
Water Supply and Sewerage Authority and to help meet the city's need for
supplies of safe water and sanitation. Under the Project, 560,000 peuple
would be served through new connections and standposts. In addition, the
Project would increase the utilization, where affordable, of existing
sewerage facilities and initiate a program to deliver low-cost sanitation
services. These efforts are motivated by the urgent need to meet the bas.c
needs of the rapidly growing urban population and to begin to control the
high incidence of sanitation-related diseases.
7.11    The Project would increase the efficiency and effectiveness of
DWASA's operations and strengthen its finances. These improvements would
raise the quality of services, reduce costs and enhance the fairness with
which costs are recovered. DWASA, as the leading urban water authority in
Bangladesh, is expected both to provide a model for tlEe operation and
financing of water supply and sanitation services, and to develop systems,
procedures, manuals and standards for use by ather urban authorities.



-34-
Under this Project, training would be offered to other COB agencies and to
local bodies responsible for water supply in order to help address the
manpower constraints ir the sector.
7.12    The water supply component of the Project is expected to yield an
economic rate of return on investments (ERR) of 131 when 87Z of water
delivered to customers is valued at prevailing tariffs, prices are set at
their border values and asset lives of 30 years are employed in the analyses.
Reducing the assumed Life of major assets (i.e. wells end related civil
works) to 20 years would lower the ERR to about 12Z. Economic analyses based
on market prices result in ERRs of 10 and 9Z for asset lives of
30 and 20 years, respectively. The foregoing estimates are based on the
assumption that half of the water being supplied without being billed is
valued by consumers. If the unbilled water were not paid for willingly, the
ERR would decrease by about 4 percentage points to 9Z. Finally, the increase
in supply will benefit primarily those who at present do not have access to
the public water supply and those who wilL migrate to or be born in Dhaka
over the project period. For these people, the value of water supplied is
not adequately measured by market prices since the additional supply to them
represents a large proportion of their demand rather than a small increment
to a preexisting demand. An estimate of consumer surplus therefore should be
included in quantifying benefits. If the demand function is assumed to
display a constant price elasticity of .50 over the relevant range and the
Project is assumed to double the quantity of water supplies to these new
consumers, then the ERR rises sharply to 20Z. Because the capital works will
be fully utilized on completion, rates of return are insen3itive to
implementation delays. Benefits, such as external health effscts, are not
captured by market prices are not included in the analyses. Thus all
calculations understate the economic returns to the Project. The economic

BANGLADESH
THIRD DHAKA WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
Assumptions for Financial Projections
A. Water Supply System
1.  Tubewells:  7 tubewells are expected to go into operation in FY86.
From FY87 onwards an average of 2 tubewells a year are likely to
cease operation. It is assumed that 2 replacement tubewells will be
installed in FY92, FY94 and FY95 and 3 tubewells in 1993 in order
to maintain production levels.
2. Production: For both present production and Dhaka-III tubewells,
effective capacity utilization is assumed at 90Z. Production from
the 6 Imgd treatment plant now in operation is assumed constant.
From FY86 to F90, tubewells are planned to be installed at
half-year.
3. Leakage: Leakage is expected to decrease from the existing 23Z of
production to 16% over the next ten years due to the leak detection
program and improvements in the distribution net-work.
4.  Unbilled Water Usage:  Unbilled water is assumed to decrease
from 23% of production to 9% over the next years due to the
increase in metered connections (both new and conversion) and
improvements in monitoring of illegal connections.
5. Cxnnections:
- Domestic Connections: It is assumed that from F86 to FY90, about
4,700 new metered connections will be installed each year.
Thereafter about 3,000 metered connections will be installed
each year.
- It is assumed that from FY86 to FY88 about 4,000 connections per
year will be converted to meters, from FY89 to F92 about 3,000
connections and from FY93 to FY95 about 2,000 connections.
- Public Stand Posts: The number of stand posts are assumed to
remain constant with the 55 standposts under the project
replacing disfunctional standposts in the Old City.



-49-
ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 5
- GOB Offices: Connections to GOB offices are assumed to increase
at the rate of about 5 each year from the present 229 to 279
in FY95.
- Comercial Connections: During the last four years, an average of
125 connections were made each year. In the short term this rate
is Likely to increas-. From FY86 to FY90, about 140 connections
per year are expected to be made, and from FY91 to FY95, about
120 connections per year.
Industrial Connections: During the last four years, about 100
connections were made each year. Since some industrial estates
are being opened, an average of about 150 connections are
expected to be made each year from FY86 to FY90 and about 120
connections per year from FY91 to FY95.
Community Connections: During the last four years about 8 new
connections were made each year. From FY86 to FY95, it is
assumed that about 10 aew connections will be made each year.
6. Distribution: Domestic metered consumption has been calculated on
the basis of 22 people served per connection. The present
consumption is about 132 lpcd which is likely to decrease due to
new tariffs from June 1985, and decrease in per capita supply from
FY85 to FY95. It is estimated that consumption in FY86 will be
130 lpcd, in FY8; about 128 lpcd and that consumption will decrease
by one lpcd each year up to FY95 when it will be about 120 lpcd.
Domestic non-metered consumption has also been based on 22 people
served per connection. The present consumption pattern is assumed to
be 154 lpcd including provision for unaccounted-for water. This is
likely to remain constant throughout the project period.
About 14 mld water is produced through 1,189 stand posts and this is
likely to remain constant throughout the project period. Presently
about 200 people are served per stand post and consumption net of
50X wastage is about 30 lpcd.
Consumption of water in GOB offices is estimated at 35,964 lpcd per
connection, and is assumed constant.
Consumption of water in comercial establishments is estimated as
6302 lpcd per connection and is assumed constant.



-50-
ANNEX 5
Page 3 of 5
Consumption in industries is estimated at 4,982 Ipcd per connection
and is assumed constant.
Consumption of water in community services is estimated at 16,935
lpcd per connection and is assumed constant.
7. Billed Water: From the previous data, it is estimated that
at present the following percentages of water distributed under the
following categories are billed:
a - Domestic metered        90%
b - Domestic non-metered   50Z
c - GOB Offices             80%
d - Commercial              70%
e - Industrial              75Z
f - Community               85%
g - Standposts             I00Z
Billed water for domestic metered connections
will improve moderately increasing to 92% of consumption in FY90
and 94Z in FY95.
Billed water for domestic non-metered connections is calculated,
as a proxy, by dividing the revenue collected (X of ARV) by the
tariff. This quantity is expected to increase by 2Z each year
as a result of reduction in wastage, which is most Dpparent in
the Old City where many non-metered connections are located.
Billed water for GOB offices is expected to increase by 1X
eact year to 90Z by FY95.
Billed water for commercial connections is expected to increase by
1Z each year to 90% by FY95.
Billed water for industrial connections is expected to increase by
12 each year to 85% by FY95.
Billed water for community connections is expected to increase by
9O0 by FY95.

B. Sewerage System
1. Sever Limes: During Dhaha NAUs-ll, about 23 miles of sewer lines
are to be constructed frm Fm86 to FY90. From FY90 to FY95 the
total length of sever limes is expected to remain constant.
2.  isbuer Connections: Frou FT86 to FY9M about 1,600 new sewer connec-
tions are expected to be installed each year of which 400 would be
metered aud 1,200 non-metered- Prom 1 to FY95 about 1,200
counections are expected to be installed each year of which about
300 would be mtered.
Froa  FY86 to MF    about 1,060 connectiorn. are expected to be
convertud to mtering each year from F9 to FY92 about 800
connections and from  FY3 to ms about 600 connections.
C. Costs
- All direct operating costs for water and sewerage are assumed
to increase by 101 a year plus the factor increase in mld production
and in sewer lines. Due to inflation and the increase in
operations overhead salaries and wages are expected to increase
by 1SZ a year froa FY66 (an extraordinary 401 increase is projected
from FUYS-FYS); otbhr overhead expenses are expected to increase by
101 a year.
D. Interest Payesnts
- The five year grace period for the Third Dhaka Project loan ends in
mid-Ml. Due to retroactive financing, procurement for the project
is due Lo start in mid-FY3.
S. Ravenues
- Current water rates for metered connection are used for FY85 and
FY66. A 35S tariff increase in assumed at the beginning of FY87;
averag  yearly inereses of about 5S are assumed for FY88-MY95, with
a 12.5Z increase rquired for FY 91  ihe  the debt burden is
substantially increase.  Da  debt is assumed to be a percentage of
water and sewrage billings (met "other revenue"); the percentages
are 101 for PTIS-PYI, 9Z for MI6 ad FY90, SZ for FY91-93 and 7Z
for FY94-MY93. The Aoual Detal Value which was raised by about
101 in 1985 is assumd at its 1965 level.  on_-etered revenues vary
from FY68-FT5 according to the nm*er of connections.



-52-
AME 5
Page 5 of 5
- Rates for non-metered connections are billed at 17.5Z of the
Annual Rental Value.
- Sewerage charges for both metered and unmetered connections
are equivalent to customers' respective water charges. Almost
all sewerage connections are higher volume water users.
F. Balance Sheet
- Depreciation, based on DIASA analysis, is assumed to equal a
weighted average of 2.75Z of gross assets (equivalent to a
36 year life on straight life depreciation).
- Accounts payable are equal to two months of operating,
maintenance and overhead costs.
- Accounts receivable are equal to 9 months billings in FY85,
6 months in FY86 and 4 months thereafter.
- Stores are equal to four months operating and maintenance costs.
- Advances are equal to one month operating and maintenance costs.
- Other payables (i.e. earnest money) are equal to SZ of the year's
investment.
- There is no work in progress shown since all the year's
tubewell and system investments are completed within the year.

THIRD DHAKA WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
Economic Analysis
The marginal cost of water and the economic rate of return to the
proposed investment in water supply have been calculated at both market and
border prices. The prices for water that prevailed in 1985 have been assumed
to reflect wilLingness to pay. However, these prices have not limited demand
to the supplies available, and thus non-price rationing has occurred.
Therefore, the prices used in the analyses understate marginal benefits to
present customers. In addition, the project will supply water to
560,000 people who did not previously have access to a safe public supply.
For these customers, the economic benefits from the project should be
measured by the area beneath the demand curve corresponding to the increase
in quantity demanded. The analysis has assumed that half of the supply to
newly served persons is additional to their demands prior to the project; the
corresponding consumer surplus has been approximated by assuming that the
demand curve exhibits a constant price elasticity of .50 over the relevant
segment of the household demand curve. This approximation in conservative.
Finally, DIABA is assumed to bill 73Z of water supplied to customers. The
unit revenue for water therefore is defined as the product of the average
tariff and the billing rate. Calculations have also been prepared asuming
that 86X of sales are billed (i.e. that the share unbilled is halved). The
major assets of the project (wells and pipelines have been assumed to have an
economic life of 30 years). Sensitivity analyses have examined the
consequences of shortening the economic life to 20 years. Minor assets
(pumps, meters, meter controls, etc.) have been assumed to be replaced
periodically as part of routine operations and maintenance.
The analyses reveal that the average incremental cost (AIC) of water
supplied (net of distribution losses) is Taka 1.60 per cu m at a discount
rate of 8Z, shadow prices and asset lives of 30 years. The sensitivity of
AIC to the discount rate is shown in the accompanying table. The economic
rate of return (ERR) for the project is 9% if the present average revenue
from sales is assumed to approximate benefits. If the share of water
supplied but not billed is reduced by half, the ERR would increase to 13S.
If all sales were billed at the prevailing average tariff for billed
customers, the ERR vould be 18:. Inclusion of estimated consumer surplus
increases the estimated ERR by about 7 percentage points. Thus, the fullest
accounting of benefits (e.g. assuming that all water sold is billed and that
consumer surplus is included in the estimate of benefits) produces an
estimated ERR of about 26Z. Even then, the external benefits to public
health and the environment are not captured and thus would be additional.
