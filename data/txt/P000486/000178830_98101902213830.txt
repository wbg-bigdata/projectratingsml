INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHAD
FOR A RICE IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Chad, for the equivalent of US$7.5
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a rice irrigation project. The
African Development Fund (ADF), the new-created soft-lending affiliate of the
African Development Bank, would make a loan of 4 million ADF units of account
(equivalent aprroximately to US$3.9 million) 1/ on terms identical to those
of IDA. The proceeds of the IDA credit and ADF loan would be made available
to the Office de Mise en Valeur de Sategui-Deressia (OMVSD) and would be
repaid in 50 years, including 6 years of grace, by annual installments of
CFAF 90 million which would yield 1.4 percent per annum interest on the loan.
The Government would bear the foreign exchange risk.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The report, "Chad's Economic Development:   Constraints and Potential"
(75a-CD), of the economic mission which visited Chad in April/May 1972, was
distributed to the Executive Directors on July 2, 1973 (R73-191). A special
mission visited Chad in December 1973 to update our information on the Govern-
ment's financial situation; the findings of the mission are reflected in this
report. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        With extremely poor natural resources, a harsh climate, a limited
infrastructure and a pervasive lack of skills, Chad faces unusually difficult
handicaps in its economic development. An additional difficulty is the high
cost of transport to the outside world; the main centers of activity of this
large land-locked country are located at 1,000 to 1,500 km from the nearest
sea port. With a per capita GNP of $80 in 1971, Chad is classified by the
United Nations as one of the 25 least developed countries in the world.
4.        Most of the population -   at least 90 percent -   lives in rural
areas, deriving their livelihood from agriculture and livestock. About half
of the rural population lives in central Chad as semi-nomadic livestock
herders who exploit the Sahelian grasslands. The other half lives in the
relatively higher rainfall zone in the South, where they grow millet and
sorghum as food crops and cotton as a cash crop. Cotton accounts for almost
70 percent of recorded exports. A recent and relatively successful diversifi-
cation effort in the South is the introduction of rice growing on the flood
plains of the Logone River.
1/   US$ amounts in this report for ADF financing are indicative only as a
rate of CFAF 260 - US$1 has been used: for ADF loans CFAF amounts are
converted at a fixed rate of one ADF unit of account - CFAF 256.



- 2 -
5.        In the first decade since independence in 1960, GDP grew by about
5 percent annually in current prices, and 2 percent in constant prices. The
most rapid growth took place in the market economy, mainly import substitution
industries and services, while the growth of livestock and subsistence crops
probably did not exceed the population growth rate of 1.5 percent annually.
Accordingly, income disparities grew between the north and the south, as well
as between the small modern sector in the towns and the mass of the people
in the rural areas.
6.        Since the late 1960's two events occurred which have affected Chad's
growth and fiscal performance - the civil war and the drought.
7.        The civil war broke out in 1968.   It made wide areas of the country
insecure and cut off traditional cattle trading routes. Wells were neglected
and the supply of water for livestock dwindled. Earlier progress in animal
disease control was lost. The effects of the civil war were compounded by
droughts which occurred in three of the last five years. Enormous losses of
cattle have been reported, cotton output dropped and shortages of basic food-
stuffs occurred even in those areas which normally produce a surplus of food.
Emergency food shipments from abroad have thus far been able to avert wide-
spread starvation.
8.        The civil war and the drought have made the financial situation of
the Government precarious. Up to 1968, the Government's current budget had
been in balance, and considering the country's development constraints, the
overall fiscal performance appeared satisfactory. After 1968, however,
expenditures started to grow much more rapidly than receipts. Military
outlays alone rose from 18 to 31 percent of the total budget outlays. The
drought further increased the demand for Government services while reducing
revenues. The overall budget deficit rose from CFAF 1.6 billion in 1968 to
4.3 billion in 1972; it is expected to have declined to CFAF 4.0 billion
during fiscal year 1973. Annual French budgetary subsidies have partly
covered these deficits. However, a considerable financial gap remained,
causing arrears on Government payments to rise to CFAF 6.1 billion by
September 1973.
9.        The fiscal situation constitutes a serious obstacle to development,
as Chad can finance neither the required capital nor the recurrent expendi-
tures of ongoing and new high priority projects. Even essential economic
services have had to be curtailed. Chad's authorities agree with our assess-
ment of the fiscal problem and with the need to rehabilitate their public
finances, re-examine current spending priorities and eventually make a start
on generating public savings.   The conclusions and recommendations of the
recent fiscal review mission have been transmitted to the Government. The
IMF, with whom we are in close contact on the matter, plans to send a mission
soon to review prospects for a stabilization program.   The outlook is that
even with the best performance, it will be years before Chad can hope to
overcome the fiscal constraint and generate current budget surpluses.



-3-
10.       Chad's development potential lies in its rural areas.   Opportunities
for productive employment in towns will remain small. Progress in the rural
economy, however, will be slow. Even assuming political stability and normal
rainfall, it will take many years and great efforts to restore the productive
capacity destroyed by years of civil war and drought. The prospects for
the agricultural sector are more fully described in Part III.
11.       In view of Chad's very limited savings capacity, almost all of the
country's investment has been financed by external sources. Foreign aid
received during 1965-71 averaged $13 million a year, almost $4 per capita.
Most of the aid - 86 percent - consisted of grants. France and FED provided
the bulk of aid (about 40 and 30 percent respectively). Germany, Denmark,
the European Investment Bank and United Nations agencies made smaller contri-
butions. IDA credits during the period accounted for 4 percent of total aid.
12.       External public debt outstanding and disbursed on December 31, 1971,
amounted to US$34.8 million; IDA credits represented a little over 5 percent
of this amount. In 1971 debt service was estimated at 8 percent of the export
earnings. To the best of our knowledge no major additions to the debt have
been made since the end of 1971. Chad's traditional aid donors - France and
the EEC - have made no new loans available during the past two years. Chad
reportedly did receive in 1973 pledges of aid from the People's Republic of
China and some Middle Eastern countries, but these pledges have not yet been
followed by specific loan agreements.
13.       In the light of Chad's poverty and lo-w per capita income, its modest
prospects for growth of GDP and exports of goods and non-factor services,
external borrowing should be, to the extent possible, on concessionary terms.
Furthermore, even with good fiscal performance, Chad will have neither the free
budgetary resources through the end of the 1970's to enable it to pay its share
of capital outlays, nor will it be able to afford substantial new outlays for
recurrent costs associated with new projects. In the next few years, foreign
aid agencies should therefore consider financing -irtually the total cost of
projects, including, in the early years of project operation, a high propor-
tion of current operating cost.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CHAD
14.       Since 1968, when the first credit was made, the Bank Group has
extended five credits to Chad, totalling US$13.2 million 2/ -- one for highway
maintenance, two for education, one for livestock development and the fifth
credit, approved on November 13, 1973, for drought relief.
15.       With the exception of the highway maintenance credit (the Drought
Relief Credit is not yet effective), disbursements and project implementation
are behind schedule, principally as a result of the government's inability to
2/   Includes supplementary financing of US$0.9 million approved in August
1973 for the two education projects.



finance its contribution. In recognition of the government's tight budgetary
position, which has been aggravated by the current drought conditions, the
Executive Directors last August approved supplementary financing for the two
ongoing education projects to provide for 100 percent financing and also to
offset the effects of the devaluation of the US dollar.    Similarly, IDA financ-
ing of the livestock project was increased to 100 percent of total cost. Annex
II contains a summary statement of IDA credits as of February 28, 1974, and
notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
16.       One major factor that has so far militated against a substantial
expansion of Bank Group operations in Chad has been the scarcity of well-
prepared projects. In these circumstances, the Bank has concentrated its
efforts on assisting the Government (in many cases in cooperation with other
aid agencies) in identifying and preparing new projects in key sectors, while
at the same time trying to ensure successful implementation of ongoing projects.
These efforts are gradually paying off in the form of a growing pipeline of
suitable projects, mainly in transportation and agriculture.
17.       In keeping with the Government's development priorities, the Bank
Group's lending strategy to Chad continues to focus on agriculture (including
livestock), transportation and education - the most critical sectors of the
economy, In the livestock sub-sector a second project has been identified
by our Permanent Mission in West Africa, and a number of other aid agencies
have expressed interest in participating in financing this project. Further,
the Livestock Development Unit, established under the first project with UNDP
financing, will provide an important framework for the identification and
preparation of further projects in this highly important sub-sector of the
economy. Another project, prepared with FAC financing, is the Lake Chad Polders
project for smallholder cotton and wheat production; Government has requested
IDA financing and other aid agencies (FAC, USAID and ADF) have expressed
interest.
18.       In transportation, priority is being given to the improvement of
crop marketing roads. To this end, a two-phase improvement program for cotton
roads is being prepared. The first phase, aimed at improving selected seasonal
roads used for the transportation of seed cotton to ginneries was appraised
in November 1973 and is scheduled to be presented to the Executive Directors
before the end of this fiscal year; the second phase would cover the improve-
ment of all-weather roads used for transporting cotton fiber from ginneries
to export outlets. Preparation of the second phase will be financed under
the first phase project. In the field of education, we are reviewing a report
(financed under an existing IDA credit) on a possible project for the training
of young farmers.
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN CHAD
19.       The development of Chad's rural economy presents the best opportunity
for producing the new resources, employment and incomes required to raise the
standard of living of the bulk of its people.



-5-
20.       Within the rural economy livestock production is one of the most
important activities. It provides subsistence and cash income to some 1.9
million nomadic and semi-nomadic pastoralists in the sahelian and sudanian
north and center of the country. Before the 1972/73 drought, Chad's livestock
population was estimated at 4.5 million cattle, 1.5 million sheep, 2.8 million
goats, 0.4 million camels and 0.4 million equines. The drought has reduced
the cattle herd by at least 25 percent although other livestock has been less
seriously affected.
21.       Exports of chilled meat from N'Djamena to Zaire and Congo have
developed favorably in recent years, and increasing Nigerian demand for
Chadian cattle on the hoof have considerably improved the outlook for live-
stock production. However, Chad will have difficulty in responding to this
opportunity because, although available pastures would support a larger herd,
lack of watering facilities and poor animal health services are likely to
hinder a substantial increase in meat production in the near future.
22.       There are several opportunities for raising livestock production
over the next decade. Ongoing and new well construction programs would have
to be complemented by grazing control, efficient animal health services, con-
struction of stock routes and improvement of marketing channels. An ongoing
IDA-financed project (Credit 309-CD) and programs by other agencies, namely
FED and FAC, are concentrating on these requirements. In addition, under
Credit 309-CD IDA is financing a study on taxation of the livestock sub-sector
and is providing equipment for veterinary and water development services
under the Drought Relief Fund Project (Credit 445-CD).
23.       An equally important potential lies in Chad's crop agriculture
concentrated in the Logone-Chari River Basins, containing about 1.6 million
people, where opportunities exist for raising cotton productivity and
increasing food output of such crops as millet, sorghum and particularly
irrigated rice.
24.       Cotton is Chad's most important export crop.   In order to expand
production, FED, in 1965, began to subsidize half the cost of inputs (fertili-
zer and insecticides) with the balance being paid by the Government and the
producers themselves. Seed cotton production rose from 98,000 in 1960/61 to
108,000 tons in 1971/72, after reaching a peak of 149,000 tons during the
exceptionally favorable season of 1968/69. After 1968/69, the area under the
productivity program declined, and in 1972 covered only 13 percent of the total
land producing cotton.
25.       The failure of the productivity program to meet its objectives is
attributed to the droughts in 1969/70 and 1970/71, and the gradual dissipation
of economic incentives. It is estimated that as a result of the droughts
seed cotton production declined by about 5 percent in 1972 and a further
decline is expected in 1973. It is also estimated that 15 percent of the
farmers have given up cotton growing to concentrate on food crops. Further-
more, the quantity and quality of expatriate extension services have been
inadequate to bring about improved cultivation. Because of staff shortages,
technical assistance personnel have been mainly occupied with distributing
fertilizer and insecticides.



26.       A new five-year productivity program was scheduled to start in
1972/73 with the participation of FED, FAC, the Chadian Government and pro-
ducers.  As stated in Part II, the Bank has been asked to help finance the
improvement of feeder and secondary roads for this program. The new program
would be based on an integrated approach to cotton growing and wgould include
food crops, livestock, the processing of cotton and production of cotton oil.
The Government intends to make a thorough evaluation of the last program
before starting a new one with the aim of creating a nonsubsidized cotton
sector by the end of the decade.
27.       Food and cash crop production are closely related as farmers wish
to ensure adequate food supplies before responding to market incentives to
produce. Millet and sorghum are grown mainly for subsistence and are produced
throughout the sahelian zone as well as in the south.    The market for these
crops is fragmented and disorganized and wide variations in price occur
throughout the year with the farmer receiving low prices at harvest time and
merchants benefiting from scarcity during the dry season. Further, nroduction
zones are isolated by lack of transportation. Substantial benefits to pro-
ducers and consumers could be obtained from an increase in local storage
capacity and in average producer prices and trade margin and market price
controls. Better food crop production incentives should make farmers more
rilling to grow cotton as a cash crop.
28.       Rice consumption in Chad has been increasing rapidly as in other
parts of Africa, partly due to rising local urban demand and some 55,000 ha
in the Logone valley are used for traditional (rainfed or inundated) produc-
tion. Last vear, the Logone river failed to flood and this led to crop
losses and inadequate food supplies. One of the best ways of stabilizing
future rice supplies, reducing the high human and financial cost of drought,
and raising farm incomes, is through irrigated rice projects. In this re-
spect, the proposed project is designed to ensure adequate water, and to
enable a substantial yield increase through the introduction of fertilizer
and other inputs.
PART IV - TIE PROJECT
Background
29.       The project was identified in 1966-67 by an FAO/TBRD Cooperative
Program mission: the feasibility study, which was completed in 1971, was
carried out by the Italian firm of Carlo Lotti and Partners. It was appraised
in November 1972 by a Bank mission.   Negotiations for the proposed credit
were held in Washington from January 21 to 24, 1974 with a Chadian delegation
led by Mr. Abdoulaye Lamana, Minister of Economy, Plan, Commerce and Inter-
national Cooperation. To expedite calling of bids, the United Nations Devel-
opment Program is financing pre-investment engineering studies which include
preparation of tender documents and additional hydrological studies. A re-
port entitled "Chad: Appraisal of Sategui-Deressia Irrigation Project"



-7-
(No. 145a - CD), dated March 4, 1974, is being distributed separately, and
a Credit and Project Summarv is attached to this report as Annex III.
Project Components
30.       Rice is already being grown extensively by peasant farmers in the
Logone Valley where suitable soils and climatic conditions exist. It is
estimated that at present about 1,900 families grow rice in the area to be
covered by this project under traditional methods of cultivation. However,
because of lack of control works to regulate floods, lack of fertilizer and
other agricultural inputs, yields are very low. The main objective of the
project is to improve conditions for rice growing by these farmers in an
area of 11,000 ha of the Sategui-Deressia plain in southeast Chad in order
to increase production to meet the rising demand for rice. The project
would comprise the following main items:
(a) construction of two polders irrigated by gravity and
serving a net rice cultivated area of 4,000 ha;
(b) construction of 102 km of feeder roads to serve the
whole project area of 11,000 ha;
(c) rehabilitation of an existing agricultural station to
permit applied research and seed multiplication;
(d) construction of a 4 ton/hour capacity rice mill, storage
facilities, housing and offices; and
(e) feasibility studies for a second-stage project.
31.       The project would be completed in six years, construction works
would be completed in the first three years and a further three years would
be required for on-farm development. At the end of this period revenues
generated by the project would be sufficient to make it self-sustaining,
an important factor given Chad's difficult financial situation.
32.       The main project works would consist of the construction of a
6.2 km canal with an intake on the Logone River which would carry water to a
compensation basin to be used for regulating and controlling water supply to
the polders. Irrigation water would be obtained during the high water period
by gravity from the Logone River whose waters are of good quality. The
elevation of the canal intake would be set to ensure that the project water
supply would not be delayed due to low river levels by more than fifteen days
in any year.
33.       The use of the Logone River water for the project would not contra-
vene the provisions of the Chad-Cameroon Logone Water Agreement. The Govern-
ment of Chad has also obtained from Cameroon a statement to the effect that
the latter would, during the life of the project, refrain from taking action
which might to adversely affect the project.



34.       A rice mill, with a capacity of 4 tons/hour, would be installed at
Lai; eight field depots for paddy collection would be established in the
project area, and staff housing, offices and a workshop would be constructed
at project headquarters at Lai. To facilitate transportation in the project
area, a network of all-weather roads, totalling approximately 102 km, would be
constructed, and the existing road between Lai and Banga would be improved to
all-weather standard.
35.       Provision would also be made for the preparation of feasibility
studies for s second-stage project. Topographic mapping would be available
after the completion of the final designs of the project and hydrological
observations would continue during project implementation.
Project Costs
36.       The project is estimated to cost about US$12.0 million, net of duties
and taxes, with a foreign exchange component of US$7.4 million (62 percent).
The following table shows a breakdown of costs among the main project items:

Financing
37.       The proposed IDA credit of US$7.5 million would finance 63 percent
of project costs, net of duties and taxes. Of the balance 32 percent would
be covered by a loan of 4 million ADF units of account (approximately US$3.9
million equivalent) from the African Development Fund. The IDA credit
would cover total costs of civil works for construction of the irrigation
and drainage system, roads and rehabilitation of the agricultural station
(US$6.5 million), management consultants (US$0.8 million), and 50% of the
second stage studies (US$0.2 million). The ADF loan would cover total costs
of buildings, equipment, engineering consultants and 50 percent of second-
stage studies. Because of its precarious budgetary position, the Govern-
ment would contribute only the equivalent of up to US$600,000 through the
state-owned Development Bank of Chad for short- and medium-term credit for
project farmers for fertilizer and implements, and for OMVSD working capital.
These credits would bear an interest of 5-1/2 percent per annum.
38.       The financing arrangements are as follows:

The proceeds of the proposed IDA credit and ADF loan would be relent to
OMVSD and would be repaid over a period of 50 years, including 6 years of
grace, by annual installments of CFAF 90 million, thereby yielding a return
of 1.4 percent per annum; the Government would bear the foreign exchange
risks.
Project Revenues and Recovery of Costs
39.       The capital and operating costs of the project would be recovered
through the imposition of a levy on polder farmers equivalent to 10 percent
of gross production (which corresponds to about 22% of incremental net in-
come) and also through revenues derived from rice milling operations. The
levy would be collected, together with credit repayments for seeds and other
farm inputs, at harvest time through a cash deduction from farmers' proceeds
from the sale of paddy to OMVSD. The short- and medium-term credits from
OMVSD to project farmers for purchase of seeds, fertilizer and farm imple-
ments would bear interest at a rate of 5-1/2 percent per annum. The price
at which the project authority would purchase paddy from project farmers
would be sufficient to induce farmers to produce more rice and to sell it
to the authority; while the selling price for milled rice would be raised



- 10 -
to enable the authority to cover its operations and to provide for capital
repayments. Such prices would have to be acceptable to the Association
and would take into account consumers' interests.
40.       The CFAF 90 million annual payment by OMVSD to the Government
would represent about 90 percent of OMVSD's annual net income after cover-
ing all its recurrent expenditure. The remaining 10 percent would be used to
build up minimal working capital in OMVSD, including sufficient funds to
meet farmers' seasonal credit requirements.
Organization and Execution
41.       The project would be implemented by 0,MVSD, an autonomous authority
created by Government under the surveillance of the Ministry of Public Works
and Land Development. The OMVSD would have a full-time Director General who
has already been appointed by the Government after consultation with IDA and
ADF. In the absence of adequately qualified and experienced local personnel,
the authority would engage a management consulting firm to provide key manage-
ment personnel. Engineering consultants would be employed to prepare final
designs and to supervise construction work. Qualified Chadians would be made
available by the Government to understudy the expatriates. In addition,
extension workers would be made available by the Ministry of Agriculture and
further training would be provided for them at the agricultural station. IDA
and ADF would coordinate their activities closely through a protocol agreement.
Benefits and Justification
42.       As a result of improved water control and cultivation methods to
be introduced under the project, rice production in the project area is
expected to increase from the present average of 0.9 ton/ha to 2.5 ton in
the polder areas and to 1.4 ton/ha outside the polders by 1982. The total
area under paddy is also expected to increase by an estimated 2,000 ha as a
result of the project. Total annual paddy production (including production
outside the polder area) is expected to rise from the current 8,000 tons to
20,000 tons over the same period, all of which would be absorbed by domestic
demand which is estimated to increase from 25,000 to 40,000 tons of rice.
2,400 farm families, or about 11,500 persons, would benefit from the project.
Increased production and an increase in the price of paddy to be paid to pro-
ject farmers recently approved by the Government would raise the per capita
incomes in the area from US$52 to US$73 outside the polder area and to US$108
inside the polder area.
43.       In addition, the project would improve the general conditions of
rural life by opening up all-weather roads in the flood plain area. Further-
more, the research to be carried out at the agricultural station would be of
great use in future rice production development.



44.       The internal economic rate of return, with project life assumed
at 50 years, would be 13 percent. The second-phase project, which would
benefit greatly from the infrastructure, experience and sound management of
the first project, would have a substantially higher rate of return.
Procurement and Disbursement
45.       All civil works to be financed by IDA and estimated at US$6.5
million, would be subject to international competitive bidding. In view of
the remoteness and inaccessibility of the construction site and the high cost
of mobilizing materials and equipment, all civil works would be grouped in a
single contract. In view of the limited capacity of the local contracting
industry it is not expected that small local contractors will participate in
tendering for civil works even though the Government has been advised of
the new Bank policy regarding preference for local contractors. Small off-
the-shelf items costing less than US$5,000 each and in aggregate value not
exceeding US$50,000 would be purchased through normal Government procurement
procedures. Farmers' agricultural inputs would be procured under Office
National pour le Developpement Rural (ONDR) procedures. Items to be financed
by ADF would be procured under ADF procedures which provide for international
competition among ADF member states.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AIJTHORITY
46.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Chad
and the Association, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article V,
Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution
approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft agreement conforms to the normal pattern for irrigation
projects.
47.       The following would be additional conditions of effectiveness in
terms of Sectioni 10.01 (b) of the General Conditions:
(a)  establishment of OMVSD by the Government;
(b) signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the
Government and OMVSD;
(c) employment of a firm of management consultants and the
appointment of and actual commencement of his duties
by the Director-General of OMVSD;
(d) the employment of engineering consultants to assist
OMVSD prepare final designs and bid documents for the rice
mill,evaluate bids and supervise construction;
(e) the exemption by the Government of goods and services
to be imported, manufactured, procured or supplied for
the project from taxes and duties;



- 12 -
(f) signing of a loan agreement between the African
Development Fund and the Government; and
(g) fulfillment of conditions precedent to initial
disbursement, if any, of the ADF loan.
48.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOM1MENDATION
49.       In formulating this proposal, it has not been possible to take full
account of the consequences of recent increases in petroleum prices. However,
available information indicates that the proposed credit remains fully justi-
fied.
50.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit No. 125 Highway Maintenance Project: US$4.1 million Credit of
August 14, 1968: Closing Date: December 31, 1974.
The project consists of (a) a 5-year program for highway maintenance
including technical assistance, the procurement of equipment and materials,
repair shop extension, training of operators and mechanics, and establishment
of traffic data collection system; and (b) studies for the improvement of the
Djermaya-Djimtilo road. After an initial delay in procuring equipment, the
maintenance program has progressed fairly satisfactorily. However, budgetary
constraints, aggravated by the drought, required some reduction of the program.
Some training was carried out with the help of USAID on a smaller
scale than originally envisaged. A comprehensive training program is included
in a new road nroject just appraised. The feasibility study for improvement
of the Djermaya-Djimtilo road has been completed; however, detailed engineering,
found premature, has been deferred due to present low traffic volumes.
Credit No. 126 Education Project: US$2.2 million Credit of August 29, 1968
(as amended); Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
The project consists of (a) the construction and equipping of a
teacher training college at Moundou and (b) the construction and equipping of
an agricultural technician training center at N'Djamena 2/ (transferred to
Sarh 3/ under Credit 251).
Project implementation is about 30 months behind schedule due to
(a) delay in reaching agreement on design which had to be revised because of
cost overruns; (b) delay in reaching agreement on the location of the agri-
cultural technician training center; and (c) delay caused by internal budget
difficulties and cost overruns caused by underestimation and US dollar devalua-
tion. The construction of the teacher training college was completed in December
1973 in spite of difficulties in the supply of materials. The construction
of the agricultural technician training center is expected to start shortly.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weak-
nesses in project execution.

The Credit Agreement was amended in August 1973 to provide for
(a) 100 percent IDA financing of the project, net of duties and taxes;
(b) a supplementary credit of US$400,000 equivalent to cover the effects of
the US dollar devaluation and increased IDA financing; (c) reduction in en-
rollment, boarding capacity and staff housing for the teacher training college,
and a reduction in boarding capacity for the agricultural technician training
center.
Credit No. 251 Second Education Project; US$2.7 million Credit of June 16,
1971; (as amended); Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
The project consists of (a) the construction and equipping of a
secondary technical school at N'Djamena; (b) conversion of an existing tech-
nical school into a vocational training center at Sarh; (c) the transfer of
the agricultural technician training center, financed under Credit 126, from
N'Djamena to Sarh; and (d) a study of young farmers training schemes.
Project implementation is about 12 months behind schedule due to
(a) delay on reaching agreement on the schedule of accommodation for the
secondary technical school; (b) delay in reducing the cost overruns related
to the agricultural technician training center; and (c) delay caused by
internal budget difficulties and cost overruns arising from underestimation
and the devaluation of the US dollar.
Architectural designs for the secondary technical school, drawn up
by the consulting architects, have been approved by the Association and the
bidding documents are expected to be finalized shortly. The study of young
farmers training schemes has been completed and the report submitted to the
Government. The Credit Agreement was amended in August 1973 to provide for
(a) 100 percent IDA financing of the project, net of duties and taxes; (b)
a supplementary credit of US$500,000 to offset the effects of the devaluation
of the US dollar and increased IDA financing; (c) reduction in boarding
capacity and staff housing for the secondary technical school; (d) deletion
of the vocational training center at Sarh; and (e) provision of additional

(b) the establishment of two well maintenance units, including their operating
costs for the first two years; (c) support for the Livestock Development Unit
(LDU) established with UJNDP assistance.
Project execution is behind schedule for several reasons, principally
lack of counterpart funds and complex administrative procedures in Chad which
have delayed the signing of the contract for well digging and repair. The
well maintenance units are expected to start working in 1974. The LDU is only

now beginning to function because of the delay in reaching agreement on the
terms of reference. Further delay resulted from the difficulty encountered
in the recruitment of staff for the unit.
The Executive Directors have approved an increase in IDA financing
to 100 percent of total project costs, net of duties and taxes, and the es-
tablishment of a revolving account.
