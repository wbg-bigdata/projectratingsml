MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR A THIRD AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Turkey for US$250 million equivalent for a Third Agricultural
Credit Project is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would have a term
of 17 years, including five years grace and interest at the Bank's standard
variable rate. The Government would onlend the proceeds of the Bank loan to
the Agricultural Bank of Turkey (TCZB). About US$249 millioni of the proposed
loan would be onlent by TCZB to farmers, either directly by TCZB or indirectly
through the Agricultural Credit Cooperatives. The Government would bear the
foreign exchange risk and would receive a premium from TCZB for this coverage
(para. 6).
2.       Background.  While the relative importance of the agriculture sector
in the economy has been declining, it still represents about 15% of GDP, 20%
of export earnings, and 57% of civilian employment. The growth rates of
agricultural GDP and exports are projected to remain below those for the rest
of the economy. Nevertheless, the agriculture sector will continue to play a
significant role in meeting domestic food needs, supplying industrial raw
materials, and providing foreign exchange earnings and employment. In 1980,
the Government initiated a structural adjustment program aimed at developing
an outward-oriented economy with increased reliance on market forces. This
program has been supported by five Structural Adjustment Loans (SALs). More
recently, the Government has sought to deepen the process at the sectoral
level. In agriculture, as part of the agreed program under the SALs and an
Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan (FY85), the Government has focussed on
(i) reform of the policy and incentive framework, (ii) rationalization of the
public investment program, (iii) revision of input prices and distribution,
(iv) improvement of technical services, and (v) strengthening of the
agricultural credit system. In addition, the Drainage and On-Farm Development
Project is helping to improve the programming of investment in the irrigation
subsector, and the Agricultural Extension and Applied Research Project is
supporting the introduction of an improved extension system and adaptation of
research to the needs of farmers. The proposed project would be the third
agricultural credit project for Turkey and would build on experience with
institutional development and credit programs gained under the first two
projects.
3.       Project Objectives.  The proposed project is aimed at (i) the
expansion of agricultural credit, and (ii) institutional development of the
agricultural credit institutions. It would support reforms to strengthen TCZB
and the credit operations of the Agricultural Credit Cooperatives. These
institutions provide virtually all of the country's agricultural credit. It



- 2 -
would expand credit to meet the full requirements of farmers who now have
access to credit and also reach creditworthy farmers not currently receiving
institutional credit, thus facilitating the growth of agricultural production
and incomes.
4.       Project Description.  The proposed project would support the lending
and institutional development program of TCZB, the largest bank in the
country. While TCZB would make loans to farmers direct, the agricultural
credit cooperatives, which lend primarily to small- and medium-scale farmers,
would serve as additional channels for such loans utilizing resources provided
by TCZB. TCZB's institutional development program initiated during the Second
Agricultural Credit Project would focus on (i) reorganization of the head
office, (ii) decentralization through main provincial branches,
(iii) strengthening the loan appraisal/supervision/evaluation system,
(iv) program budgeting, (v) cost accounting, and (vi) personnel development
involving manpower planning, performance evaluation, staff compensation, and
training. Improvements in the credit operations of the cooperatives would be
achieved through their adoption of lending policies and procedures similar to
the revised procedures to be used by TCZB. The credit program would include
all viable farm activities and would be expanded from the ten provinces
covered under the Second Agricultural Credit Project to the 45 (of 67)
provinces where a core extension service exists, and where the loan
appraisal/supervision capacity of the credit institutions is adequate. The
project, to be carried out over three years, would provide US$249.4 million
for incremental short-term credit and medium/long-term credit, and US$0.6
million for institutional development in the form of consultant services and
fellowships. Loans disbursed by TCZB between July 1, 1988 and the loan
signature date would be covered by retroactive financing of up to 10% of the
loan amount. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$1,227 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of 46%. A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Turkey are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report (No. 6627-TU), dated May
12, 1989 is being distributed separately.
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project would be an
integral part of the Bank's strategy for assisting development of the
agriculture sector. It would continue assistance for TCZB's credit programs
which have expanded the coverage and quality of the credit delivery system and
have also been instrumental in supporting the formulation and initiation of
TCZB's institutional development program. It would also support
institution-building activities for the credit cooperatives, strengthening
their ability to serve their membership of small- and medium-scale farmers.
The Bank loan which, at present, is the only major external source of
long-term capital, would finance about 22% of the resource gap projected by
TCZB for its agricultural lending during 1989-91. By providing the credit
required for a fuller utilization of investments, it would also complement
other Bank-assisted operations such as extension and irrigation under Loans
2405 (Agricultural Extension and Applied Research), 2433 (Igdir-Aksu-Eregli-
Ercis Irrigation) and 2663 (Drainage and On-farm Development). The Bank's
continued support is vital for the success of the wide-ranging administrative
and policy changes which have been initiated by TCZB's management during the



past few months as a means of substantially strengthening the agricultural
credit system in Turkey.
6.       Agreed Actions.  (a) TCZB has agreed to the following actions:
(i) implement an institutional development program agreed with the Bank,
(ii) execute the project credit program in accordance with principles
incorporated in new agricultural credit guidelines to be issued, covering the
entire operations of TCZB, and project-specific credit guidelines to be issued
as a condition of effectiveness, and (iii) provide project funds to the credit
cooperatives in accordance with an agreement satisfactory to the Bank to be
signed as a condition of disbursement against loans to the credit
cooperatives. (b) Government and TCZB have agreed to sign a protocol between
the TCZB and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Affairs providing
for the coordination of credit and extension programs. The Government and
TCZB will sign an agreement incorporating the foreign exchange risk
arrangements, as a condition of effectiveness. The Government would cover the
foreign exchange risk for which it would receive the interest charged by TCZB
for each loan less a 4% margin for TCZB to cover its administrative cost. The
difference between the payments to be received from TCZB and the Bank's
lending rate would be the premium for the foreign exchange risk coverage.
(c) Government is firmly committed to the objective of bringing all
agricultural interest rates back to positive levels in real terms. Therefore,
in addition to the rate increases in all agricultural interest rates which
took place in February and November 1988, in May 1989 the Government increased
interest rates for tractor and combine harvester loans, and restricted access
by farmers to loans for fertilizer and livestock at the minimum interest rate
(34%). This will require larger farmers to take loans at higher rates which
will result in a higher weighted average interest rate and a reduction in
interest rate subsidies. The following future actions have been agreed upon:
(i) institute by effectiveness of the Loan a review mechanism under which the
appropriateness of the current agricultural interest rates will be examined at
least once per year and proposals will be made for rate adjustments, if
necessary. Thereafter, the lowering of agricultural interest rates will only
be possible through the agreed review mechanism; (ii) bring, by March 31,
1990, the weighted average interest rate to positive levels as an intermediate
step; (iii) bring, by March 31, 1991, all agricultural interest rates to
positive levels and maintain positive rates thereafter; (iv) set, by the end
of 1991, agricultural interest rates at levels which would allow TCZB to cover
all lending-related costs; (v) compensate TCZB, by the end of 1989, for
overdue amounts under loans to the agricultural sales cooperatives made with
Government guarantees; (vi) make arrangements designed to ensure that TCZB's
future involvement in programs for the procurement of agricultural commodities
would not adversely affect its lending operations or its financial viability;
and (vii) raise TCZB's net worth as ratio of average total resources in
accordance with a program acceptable to the Bank.
7.       Justification.  TCZB has made significant progress in the
organizational and financial restructuring started at the beginning of 1988.
In this context it has substantially increased its net worth and its
provisions for bad debts and, in November 1988, carried out a major
reorganization. The restructuring process would continue throughout the
implementation of the project. The strengthening of the TCZB and credit
cooperative operations would result in a more effective and efficient credit



- 4 -
delivery system. The project funds fill part of TCZB's resource gap and
expand credit which would result in enhanced agricultural production and
incomes. As fertilizer subsidies are gradually phased out, demand for credit
is expected to increase and would be accommodated by project funds. Together
with the modification of lending policies (particularly the easing of
collateral requirements), the expansion of credit would particularly benefit
small- and medium-scale farmers. The incremental output generated by the
project activities would be absorbed primarily by growing domestic
consumption. Only limited quantities of a few commodities such as grains and
pulses would be exported. Financial rates of return for the major types of
farm investment activities are estimated to range from 13 to 51 percent, while
economic rates of return are expected to be in the range of 17-71 percent.
8.       Risks.  Continuation of high inflation and economic disequilibrium
could jeopardize the performance of the agriculture sector and reduce demand
for credit. The Government is committed to a package of reforms, which are
expected to reduce inflation and the fiscal deficit. The Government and the
Bank are closely monitoring implementation of the reform program. A second
major area of risk concerns delays or changes in the institutional development
program of TCZB. However, progress in institutional development to date has
exceeded expectations, resulting not only in a substantially strengthened
management of TCZB, but a reorientation of its policies aimed at reducing
inefficiency and developing a strong and viable agricultural credit system.
Furthermore, TCZB will benefit from the Government's efforts to rationalize
the operations of all public sector enterprises.
9.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
