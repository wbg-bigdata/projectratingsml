APPRAISAL OF
CARACAL-TITU IRRIGATION PROJECT
ROMANIA
I. THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR
A. Natural Resources
1.01     Romania has a total land area of 23.8 million ha of which 14.9
million ha is suitable for agriculture.  Of the total agricultural land,
65.8% is arable, 20.1% pastures, 9.4% meadowland and 4.7% vineyards and
orchards.  Romania can be divided into three agroclimatic zones based on
topography, soils, and other natural conditions influencing agricultural
development priorities and performance.  Percentage distribution of agri-
cultural land by zone is shown below.
Percent of Total
Arable           Pasture & Meadowland
Zone
The Plains                        53                       18
The Foothills                     28                       32
The Mountain and Tableland        19                       50
Total                            100                      100
The Plains Zone is endowed with fertile soils, located in the Western,
Southern and Eastern parts of Romania. In 1980, about 3.0 million ha of
land in Romania is under irrigation, of which 82% is located in the Plains
Zone. The Danube river, which forms Romania's southern boundary is the
primary source of irrigation water in the southern part of this zone. The
Foothills Zone is situated to the north of the Plains Zone and is charac-
terized by shallow less productive soils. Only 18% of the total irrigated
land in Romania is located in the Foothills Zone and is irrigated by the
tributaries of the Danube. The Mountain and Tableland Zone covers the
Northern and Central Districts and is predominantly pasture and meadowland.
B. Structure, Role and Performance of Agriculture Sector
1.02     Structure:  Agricultural production in Romania is organized into
State farms (IASs), Agricultural Production Cooperatives (CAPs) and Indi-
vidual plots. CAPs hold 60% of agricultural land, while IASs own 30% and
individuals 10%. The present land tenure has evolved since the 1950's and
1960's when Government took major steps to nationalize large scale farms
and collectivize small individual holdings. Currently about 3,400 CAPs,
400 IASs and numerous individual farm units carry out farming operations



2
with the assistance of about 700 Stations for Agricultural Mechanization
(SMAs). In February 1979, Government announced plans for the creation of
about 700 umbrella organizations known as Unified Agro-Industrial Councils
comprising of IASs, CAPs and SMAs.
1.03     Role;  Despite its declining share in the national income (15% in
1979 compared to 33% in 1960), agriculture continues to play an important
role in the Romanian economy. In 1979 the share of agriculture in foreign
exchange earnings was about 12% compared to 36% in 1960. Agricultural has
potential for output growth to generate additional foreign exchange earn-
ings, while at the same time meeting the growing demand for increased
quantity of better quality agricultural products. The proposed project
would enhance these two objectives.
1.04     In the 1980's agriculture would be expected to continue to provide
additional labor for the industrial and services sectors if the 1981-85
plan targets for industrial and other non agricultural growth are to be
met. In 1960, about 65% of the active labor force was employed in agri-
culture compared to 30% in 1980. This transfer of labor force was made
possible by gradual mechanization of the agricultural sector. However, the
rate of mechanization has been lagging far behind the rate of labor out-
flow. Consequently, labor shortage is observed particularly during harvest.
1.05     Performance:  Over the last two decades, Government's development
priority has been the growth of the industrial sector. This decision meant
a restriction on the flow of investible resources, including foreign
exchange, to the agricultural sector. Moreover, Government's deliberate
policy on the development of agriculture has been to channel capital and
human investments primarily into the State sector rather than into the
Cooperative sector. The rationale for putting initial emphasis on the IASs
was twofold. First, the IASs tend to be located on the more fertile soils,
and with the larger share of irrigated land which have shown greater growth
potential. Secondly, Government's determination to build a strong State-
based socialist economy was a firm political resolution. Consequently, the
IASs experienced faster rates of growth and productivity than the CAPs. It
should be noted however, that compared to West European and U.S. agricul-
tures, even the IASs are far behind in crop yields. Despite the inadequate
availability of inputs and other services and erratic climate, Romanian
agriculture over the last four, 5-year plans (1960-1980) has attained
respectable annual growth rates. In the current Five Year Plan (1976-1980)
agriculture has grown at a rate of 5% per annum. Government's step to
reorganize the agricultural sector in 1979 (para. 1.2) is part of an effort
to streamline agricultural operations and to promote efficient utilization
of land, delivery of inputs and allocation of services. Government's new
initiative, which is now fully operational, is indicative of its recogni-
tion that to achieve higher and faster agricultural growth, it must promote
partnership among State, Cooperative and individual production sectors.

C. Agricultural Development Issues
1.06     As Romania enters the decade of the eighties, the challenges for
agricultural development are more complex compared to those of the last two
decades. This is particularly true for the irrigation sector.
1.07     The guidelines for the 1981-85 plan call for a 23% expansion (0.7
million hectares) in the area under irrigation. Large scale irrigation
projects have hitherto focused on the Danube Plains, and the Danube River
has been the source of virtually all for water irrigation to date. As the
full irrigation development potential in the Danube Plains is now being
realized, the tributaries of the Danube become the major focus of future
irrigation projects. Both the proposed project and the Bucsani-Buzau-
Siret-Prut (BBSP) Irrigation Project for which a $75 million Bank loan was
approved by the Executive Directors on December 23, 1980, would use tribu-
taries as the primary water source for irrigation. Unlike the Danube
waters which are adequate to meet the claims for navigation, irrigation
water supply, and power, irrigation water from the tributaries have to
compete with power generation and domestic water supply and to a lesser
extent with navigation, and careful basin planning to generate optimal
utilization of the water resources is called for in future investment
decisions.
1.08     Low productivity is also a major issue in Romanian agriculture.
The rationing of chemical fertilizers between domestic requirements and
export targets has resulted in sub-optimal application of fertilizers.
Despite the priority given to the irrigated areas, the rates of fertilizer
application are well below requirements. While inadequacy of fertilizer is
not the only variable input for low crop yields, it is nevertheless the
most critical input. With the completion of the new fertilizer plants
currently under construction, Government expects to be able to meet export
targets and satisfy domestic requirements.
1.09     Low intensity of mechanization and shortage of seasonal labor
are other major factors for low productivity. The rate of agricultural
mechanization particularly in the cooperative sector has not kept up to
compensate for the rate of labor migration into the industrial and service
sectors. The rate of agricultural mechanization in the 1980's may be
affected by the availability of fuel, but Government strategy currently
aims to increase farm mechanization. If agriculture continues to release
labor to the expanding industrial and service sectors without concomitant
expansion of machinery services, the performance of agriculture is likely
to worsen. The proposed project would ensure adequate provision of agri-
culture machinery in the project area.
1.10     The present cropping pattern in the different zones of Romania
require re-examination. The cropping mix, particularly in the Plains can
be improved to generate greater return to the investment particularly in
the irrigated areas. The Bank has been emphasizing the value of greater



specialization in crop production. It has recommended, for example,
increasing substantially the area under maize in the Danube Plains, while
shifting wheat and other rainfed grain production to the foothills and
mountain zones. The selection of cropping pattern in any region should
take into consideration the following factors: soil suitability, agronomic
rotation requirements, water availability, raw material requirements for
existing and future processing plants and Government's decision for
regional self-sufficiency for selected crops to minimize transport costs.
However greater specialization has taken place under Bank financed projects
and would continue under the proposed project.
D. Development Policy and Planning Strategy
1.11     Romania is now on the threshold of the Sixth Five Year Plan for
1981-1985. The first draft was issued in 1978, however, subsequent devel-
opments in the Romanian economy in particular and the world economy at
large dictated a more prudent set of output targets. The party Congress
reviewed the draft Plan and made significant changes in view of: (a)
the increasing costs of energy in the foreseeable future; and (b) non-
fulfillment of planned targets during 1976-1980, especially in agriculture,
due to inadequate equipment, and construction materials. Nevertheless the
planning strategy adheres to the previous Plan's (1975-1980) objectives
of: (a) raising land and labor productivity; (b) improving the diet of the
population by intensifying production of high value crops, meat, and dairy
products; (c) expanding surplus production for export; (d) introduction of
capital intensive technologies to release labor for non-farm employment;
and (e) expanding irrigation and drainage facilities to minimize the
effects of weather failures. Specifically, planned investments for the
agricultural sector for the period 1981-1985 include;
(a) investment of Lei 150 billion (US$10.0 billion) which represents
12.7% of the total planned investment in the economy;
(b) land reclamation in the Danube delta and in the Foothills Zone for
an area of about 154,000 ha, bringing the total arable land to
about 10 million ha;
(c) expansion of irrigation facilities from 3.0 million ha in 1980 to
about 3.7 million ha by 1985;
(d) provision of drainage facilities for an additional 0.8 million ha
and soil erosion control works to protect an additional 1.0 mil-
lion ha;
(e) adding 140,000 (predominantly 80 H.P.) tractor units, 40,000
self-propelled harvester units, and other farm machinery and
equipment;



- 5 -
(f) raising the application rate of fertilizer (active substance) from
120 kg per ha in 1980 to about 300 kg per ha in 1985 with full
capacity operation of the new fertilizer factories;
(g) adoption of high quality seeds and adequate pesticide distribu-
tion; and
(h) improvement of existing breeds of livestock and development of new
ones, for which 25% of planned investments in the agricultural
sector would be allocated.
1.12     The investment share of agriculture in total investment for the
economy has increased slightly from 11.4% to 12.7% in current prices. The
annual growth rate for agriculture which is set at 4% per annum, compared
to 5-7.5% per annum for the 1976-1980 plan, is attainable. The fertilizer
application rate has been adjusted downwards considerably to about 300 kg
per ha by 1985, compared to 280 kg per ha previously planned by 1980. The
planned rate of application, though lower than agronomic requirements, is
feasible given the desired distribution between exports and domestic use.
E. Development in the Irrigation Sub-sector
1.13     One of the principal bottlenecks of Romanian agriculture is the
erratic rainfall. Of the total arable land of 9.8 million ha about 5 mil-
lion ha are suitables for irrigation. In 1960, Romania had only 200,000 ha
of irrigated land. Government's commitment to exploit the land and water
resources is demonstrated by the rapid expansion of irrigated agriculture.
In 1980 about 3.0 million ha were irrigated including small and inefficient
local schemes. No reliable data is available to measure the efficiency of
water use on these fragmented small schemes. However on the large schemes
up to 80% irrigation efficiency has been attained. Large irrigation
schemes have so far been confined to the Danube Plains where average annual
rainfall is about 400 mm and varies widely from year to year. This rapid
expansion has been possible through pumping schemes from the Danube.
Optimum utilization of water from the tributaries requires storage, a
series of multipurpose dams are being constructed. These storage dams
which are planned for power generation would also serve to meet irrigation
requirements.
1.14     The development approach adopted in the irrigation subsector
hitherto gave priority to provision of irrigation networks. Drainage works
were given secondary priority. Consequently, delays in farming operations
due to excess surface water and crop losses due to a high water table have
been substantial. The problem becomes vividly evident in spring when high
snow accumulation on the land, and snow melts augmented by rainfall, create
excess surface water causing considerable loss to autumn crops. Moreover,
as a result of water logging, spring crops cannot be sown on time. The



- 6 -
Government has, therefore, decided that future development projects would
give first priority to removal of excess water through drainage facilities,
and irrigation would be extended only when these anti-water logging
measures have been adopted. Drainage is also being extended to existing
irrigation schemes. All previous Bank financed projects have incorporated
adequate drainage facilities.
1.15     The Government of Romania is preparing long term plans for
exploiting the multipurpose potential of all its rivers, which will be
implemented in successive five year plans. The major rivers included in
the 1981-85 irrigation program are the Olt and the Arges in south-central
Romania, and the Mostistea, the Ialomita, the Buzau, and the Siret in the
south-eastern region. The Olt and the Arges rivers basins are being devel-
oped individually, through construction of multipurpose dams; whereas, the
remaining rivers are proposed to be interconnected through a carrier canal
emanating from the Siret, flowing across the Baragan Plain and terminating
at the Mostistea. A series of multipurpose dams are proposed in the head
waters of all these rivers, which would generate power and meet the irriga-
tion and other needs of the Baragan Plain and its adjoining areas. During
periods of short supply in the river flows, generating stations, which
would be reversible, would pump water from the Danube to meet irrigation
requirements. The identification and preparation of these projects which
are a part of a long term multipurpose development program, spread over a
number of river basins would require special analytical skills. The Bank
has proposed and Government has accepted an Irrigation Subsector Review in
the Spring of 1981 to assess the suitability of the program, its priori-
ties, cost allocations between various purposes, and, if possible, to
devise a new approach to the program through sector lending.
F. Bank Strategy and Role in Agriculture
1.16     The Bank's strategy is based on promoting efficient agricultural
development while at the same time transferring needed convertible foreign
exchange to Romania and assisting with the introduction of improved produc-
tion technology. In view of lower productivity in agriculture as compared
to other sectors of the economy, the Bank's lending program gives consider-
able emphasis to the agricultural sector, while remaining in harmony with
Government's plans for agricultural development. The Bank's lending
strategy is based on the findings of various reports, including the Agri-
cultural Sector Survey of October 1976 (Report No. 953a-RO), the Basic
Economic Report dated March 1978 (Report No. 1601-RO), Country Economic
Memorandum dated August 1980 (Report No. 2757-RO), a number of recent
appraisal reports of 1979 and 1980.
1.17     The proposed loan would bring the Bank's total lending to Romania
to US$1,862.6 million for 30 projects. Of the 29 loans already approved,
fourteen, totalling US$896.5 million, have been in agriculture. Of these



six are irrigation projects, one irrigation and agricultural development
project, one agricultural credit project, one agricultural component of a
flood recovery project, two pig production and processing projects, one
poultry project, one orchards project and one cattle project. The agricul-
tural projects are supervised regularly a year and are progressing satis-
factorily with no major problems. The first irrigation project (Giurgiu-
Razmiresti, Loan 1082-RO) has been satisfactorily completed with cost
underrun and higher yields growing at a faster rate than the appraisal
estimates. A Project Completion Report has been issued; and an Audit
Report by the Operations Evaluation Department is under preparation.
1.18     The Bank has made substantial contribution to improve the tech-
nical quality of agricultural projects in Romania. In irrigation, the Bank
has set in motion the concept of preparation of alternative designs and
selection of the least cost alternatives. The Bank has also convinced the
Romanian designers and planners to postpone projects based on provisional
sources of water supply which were not technically the optimum solution,
until such time as the waters from the northern tributaries, other than the
Danube, have been developed for providing permanent water resources for
irrigating these areas. Suggestions given by Bank staff have also improved
the design of canals in loess soils, design of drainage works, maintenance,
and soil reclamation. The Bank's dialogue with the Romanian authorities
has led to an important conceptual change in the projects, i.e. inclusion
of private plots allotted to members of Cooperatives, in the irrigated
areas. This mutual understanding is also reflected in the design of proj-
ects in the livestock and horticulture subsectors, where technical innova-
tions and institutional development have become the principal focus of Bank
lending.
II. THE PROJECT AREA AND AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATIONS
A.  The Project Area
Location
2.01     Caracal.  The subproject area, covering 87,630 ha of gross agri-
cultural land, of which 86,236 ha is net and 1,394 ha of existing project
works, is located in the Plains zone in the Olt and Dolj Districts. It is
crossed by the 450 latitude north. The town of Caracal, which is sit-
uated in the heart of the project area, is about 187 km west of Bucharest.
The area lies on the west (right) bank of the Olt river, and it is the last
remaining tract of land to complete the network of irrigation systems which
are planned for the right bank for irrigation from the Olt. The Oltet
river, one of the Olt's main tributaries, establishes the project's
northern boundary as does the Bucsani-Cioroiu irrigation system (recently
financed by the Bank as part of BBSP Irrigation Project). The Olt river



- 8 -
is on the eastern border. Existing irrigation schemes form the remaining
borders; namely, Iancu Jianu and Craiova systems to the west and Sadova
Corabia and Terasa Corabia to the south. A small portion of the Stoenesti
Visina irrigation scheme touches on the southeastern corner of the sub-
project area.
2.02     Titu.  The subproject area, covering 42,108 ha of gross agricul-
tural land of which 41,698 ha net and 410 ha of existing project works is
located in the Arges river basin of the Plains zone lies on both banks of
the Arges river which flows in a southeasterly direction towards the
Danube, passing close to the capital of Bucharest. The area lies between
440 and 450 latitude north, within the Districts of Dimbovita and
Ilfov. The southern end of the subproject site is about 23 km northwest of
Bucharest. It is bordered by the Dimbovita river to the north-east, the
Ciorogirla river to the south-east and the Neajlov river to the south-west.
Topography and Drainage
2.03     Caracal.  Three topographical features characterize the subproject
area, namely: (i) a relatively narrow flood plain along the Olt, Oltet and
Teslui rivers approximately 80m ABSL 1/; (ii) adjoining terrace formations
between lOOm and 120m elevation; and (iii) an extensive flat plain or
plateau from between 120m to 130m in elevation, referred to locally as the
Rotunda plain. The southwestern portion of this plain is unique in that it
consists of sandy dunes and interdunes, which have been partially stabil-
ized by wind breaks of tree plantings. This area requires special reclama-
tion measures. The subproject area is transversed from west to east by
numerous streams and associated valleys leading in the direction of the Olt
river and its tributaries. The largest year round flowing stream is the
Teslui, located in the northern part of the project area. Numerous flood
control and storage dams, mostly of rudimentary construction, are found in
the valleys. In three of the larger valleys in the southern portion of the
area there are a number of small dams built over a decade ago. Some are
antiquated and inadequate to mitigate frequent floods. Reconstruction is
required. Ground water flow is from west to east and from north to south.
In general, ground water is found within 5m in the flood plains and low
terraces and between 5m and lm in the high terraces and plateau. About 9%
of the project area displays a persistent high water table requiring tile
drainage. Surface drainage is sufficiently poor in approximately 44% of
the area, because of an impervious layer in the B horizon of the soil
profile, to necessitate either new open drainage works or improvement of
existing ones as well as deep-plowing, sub-soiling and soil-chiselling in
some instances.
2.04     Titu.  The prevailing relief form is the flood plain, formed by
the major river beds of the Arges, Ciorogirla and Sabar rivers and their
tributaries, exhibiting an almost continuous slope from the north-west to
the south-east (171m - 108m, ABSL). To a lesser degree, alluvial terraces
1/ Above Baltic Sea level.



- 9 -
and transitional zones from higher plains to the predominant flood plain
occur. Another distinguishing topographical feature is the presence of
numerous depressions formed by dead river beds and old valleys where water
accumulates and require considerable reclamation works. t)urface water
runoff is from north-west to south-east.  Depth of ground water varies
from Om to lm in about 8% of the area, lm to 3m in 69%, from 3m to 5m in
18%, and over 5m in 5% of the project area. Although the soils are deep,
surface drainage is deficient in much of the area because of poor soil
permeability; and new open drainage works would be required on approx-
imately 86% of the area and tile drainage on 8%.
2.05     Climate.  The climatological data for the meteorological stations
of Caracal, Bucharest-Filaret and Titu, which are in the project area, are
given in Annex 1 Tables T-l and T-2. The climate is typically continental
with cold winters and hot summers. Average annual temperature is l0.50C.
During the cropping period for summer crops, from April through October,
the highest and lowest mean monthly temperatures of 22.70C and 10.90C
ocur in July and October, respectively. First frost usually occurs in late
September, while the last frost may occur up to late April. The mean
annual rainfall is 573mm; however, it is highly variable.  For example, in
the Caracal subproject area, the highest yearly precipitation of 809mm was
recorded in 1957 and the lowest, at 335mm in 1958. The rainfall pattern
during the cropping season also is highly erratic. During this period,
rainfall averages less than 400mm; however, years registering less than 300
mm are not uncommon, and periods of drought extending up to 60 days may
occur. These conditions adversely affect rainfed agricultural production.
Irrigation can greatly improve yields of summer grown crops. Although
winds are not sufficiently strong to be a constraint to sprinkler irriga-
tion, the evapotranspiration in summer is high and cannot be satisfied with
the prevailing rainfall.
2.06     Soils.  Deep mollisols (chernozemic), highly regarded throughout
the world for their productivity, of medium to fine texture formed on loess
deposits cover approximately 86% of the Caracal subproject area. Alluvial
soils formed on alluvial and alluvial-pluvial deposited material consisting
of sands, fine sands, silts and clays, cover about 72% of the Titu sub-
project area. The remaining soils are reddish-brown podzols and to a
lesser extent deep sandy soils laid on an eolian relief and gleyic soils
located in marshy, low areas of old river beds and closed depressions. In
general, the physical properties of a large proportion of the soils neces-
sitate some form of open drainage, mostly of a simple design to avoid
excess accumulation of surface water during periods of heavy rainfall.
Less than 10% of the soils require tile drainage to lower the water table.
The pH of the soil is satisfactory, ranging from a slightly acidic to
slightly basic reaction. The chernozems are medium to high in mineral
nutrients and although the remainiing soils are less endowed in natural
fertility, they too can be expected to respond very favorably to the
application of fertilizers. In addition, manuring would be required as a
reclamation measure on the sandy soils; whereas, the normal soils have an
adequate content of organic matter.



- 10 -
2.07     Land Classification.  Approximately 70% of the soils are Class I
and II 1/, exhibiting either slight or no limitations for irrigated farm-
ing. The remainder are also suitable but with moderate (21%) to severe
(6%) limitations under present unimproved conditions. The predominant
limitation governing the soil class differentiation in the project area is
deficient drainage. The greatest requirement is for simple surface drain-
age with only about 9% requiring tile drainage. In some instances sub-
soiling, deep plowing and chiselling is necessary to improve aeration and
water infiltration. To a much lesser degree, coarse textured soils with
high permeability, topography of sandy dunes and interdunes and slope
gradient are other characteristics which present limitations to irrigated
farming. Regulation of the intensity and frequency of sprinkler irriga-
tion, reshaping of sandy dunes and soil erosion control measures are neces-
sary to overcome the above restrictions. The soils in all classes can
produce satisfactory crop yields on a sustained basis once the ameliorative
measures are implemented.
2.08     Water Resources.  The Olt and Arges Rivers, which flow south,
from the Romanian central mountains, to the Danube constitute the water
resources within the project area. The Olt drains 2.14 million hectares
while the Arges drains 0.71 million hectares. River flows are contributed
by snowmelt and rainfall excess. The flow is recorded at a number of gaug-
ing stations and about 40 years discharge observations are available. The
dry weather river flow of the two rivers is fully utilized; the Olt mainly
for irrigation and Arges mainly for towns and industrial use. Storages
have been constructed. Additional storages are under construction and
planned for future for optimum multipurpose development, holding the runoff
in the wet period for use in dry periods. The available ground water is
allocated to the industrial and domestic use, as it does not have large
potential to permit other uses.
2.09     Population.  The total rural population in the project area is
about 212,000 of which about 78,000 (37%) constitute the active labor
force. The size of the rural population and distribution of the active
labor force is detailed below:

The totals of the breakdown of the active labor force by CAPs and IASs and
by permanent and seasonal workers exceed the active labor total because
some of the seasonal workers are employed both in CAPs and IASs, and there-
fore are counted twice. The rural population is traditionally employed in
rainfed agriculture and is generally knowledgeable about agricultural
practices. Female workers in the project area make up 60% of the total
agricultural labor force which is in line with the national average. The
existing labor force would be adequate to meet the requirements of the
proposed project.
Communications, Water Supply and Electricity
2.10     Caracal.  The subproject area is well linked with the national
road and railway netorks. North-south and east-west national highways
criss-cross the area close to the town of Caracal and there are an abund-
ance of inter-connecting hard surfaced and all-weather roads. The existing
farm road network which is mostly ungravelled, adequately serves the needs
of the area. A double-track railway disects the center of the area from
east to west and smaller single-track lines are adequate to meet the needs
for handling agricultural products. There is adequate supply of year-round
ground water. Deep wells provide piped water for the larger towns and
shallow wells, from which water is hand drawn, supply the villages and
detached holdings. All towns and villages, as well as isolated coopera-
tives and State farms, within the subproject area are served with electric
power from the national grid.
2.11     Titu.  The Bucharest-Pitesti national highway transverses the
entire length of the subproject area. The Bucharest-Piteti double electri-
fied railway follows the northeastern limit of the subproject site. The
area is crossed by numerous district and communal asphalted roads, which
provide adequate linkage between the agricultural and industrial production



- 12 -
centers and commercial and trading centers. Water for village households
is drawn manually from shallow open wells, built along the main village
roads or within each private holding. The larger towns are provided with
piped water supply. The area is crossed by a dense network of high power
lines to supply the agricultural production units and to satisfy the
consumption of towns and villages.
B. Agriculture Organizations
2.12     Agriculture Production Cooperatives (CAPs) and State Agricultural
Enterprises (IASs). The number of agricultural production units (CAPs and
IASs) and their share of the net agricultural land in the project area are
shown below;

2.13      The CAPs hold 83% of the total cropped land in the project area.
Included in this figure are the small private plots retained by CAP members
for their personal use, which amounts to about 9700 ha or 9% of the total
CAP land.
2.14      There are a total of nine Inter-cooperative Associations (ICAs)
which are formed by several CAPs to carry out large scale factory type
production of livestock products and to a lesser extent vegetables. They
have little land and depend almost entirely on purchased feed and other
materials.
2.15     Unified Agroindustrial Councils (UACs) and Stations for Agricul-
tural Mechanization (SMAs). There are 13 Agroindustrial Councils in the
Caracal and 10 in Titu subproject areas. Likewise, the same number of SMAs
since the territories of the UACs coincides with those of SMAs. The over-
all project total of 23 lACs comprises a total of 81 CAPs and 14 IASs.  The
land of some CAPs and IASs falls within the jurisdiction of two different



- 13 -
UACs; and, therefore, are counted twice. The UACs were created in February
1979 in an effort to eliminate the performance disparities between [ASs and
CAPs. These councils are responsible for coordinating the planning of all
agricultural activities in the area such as the introduction of new crop-
ping patterns and production technology and for dispensing equal levels of
services and inputs (mechanization, irrigation, fertilizer, seeds, plant
protection, etc.) for the CAPs and IASs in their jurisdiction. Additional
information concerning agriculture production organizations in Romania can
be found in numerous Bank reports 1/.
III. PRESENT AND FUTURE LAND USE AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
A. Land Use
3.01     With the proposed irrigation, drainage and other ancillary works,
the present and future land use and agricultural production in the project
area are described in the following sections. The project works to support
future land use and agricultural production are described in Chapter IV.
3.02     Caracal.  The present and future distribution of land in the
Caracal subproject area is shown below:

The subproject covers a gross area of 105,740 ha, of which the net agri-
cultural land currently is 86,236 (81.6%). Four percent of the net agri-
cultural land is irrigated through widely scattered, inefficient and
rudimentary local schemes. At full development, the proposed project will
irrigate 85,686 ha, which represents 100% of the net agricultural land
and 81% of the gross project area. Although the project reduces the non-
agricultural land, it increases the area devoted to project works; the net
effect would be to reduce the net cultivable land by less than 1%. Under
Romanian law, a comparable amount of arable land taken for project works
construction is required to be reclaimed elsewhere.

The gross area of this project site is 52,392 ha, of which 41,698 ha net
is cultivated.  The difference between the two, in addition to non-
agricultural land and works, pertains to small, odd-shaped, isolated
parcels of land between irregular borders of forests, villages and roads.
Approximately 13% of the net agricultural land is presently irrigated
through local schemes. The proposed irrigation project would provide water
for 41,487 ha, the total area of cultivable land.
Cropping Pattern
3.04     General.  Over the past five years, with the introduction of large
scale, modern irrigation systems in the Plains Zone of southern Romania,
the cropping pattern reflects a gradual shift from rainfed traditional
autumn-winter cereal farming to greater emphasis on summer crops which are
highly responsive to irrigation. An analysis of eight Bank assisted irri-
gation projects 1/ reveals that, on the average, the pre-project cropping
pattern was composed of about 32% wheat and barley combined and a similar
proportion of maize. With the projects, the percentage of winter cereals
in the cropping pattern decreased to 19% and maize increased to 44%.
National and regional cropping patterns are based on studies and recommen-
dations of the Institute for Planning and Land Distribution, which is
subordinated to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry (MAFI). The
Institute collaborates with ISPIF in the revision of cropping patterns for
irrigation projects. Final decisions in any given area are reached collec-
tively by the General Director of Agriculture of the concerned District,
the newly established UACs and the management of the concerned State and
cooperative farms. The projected cropping pattern comprises a range of
crops with varying growing seasons which together cover the entire summer

period ensuring an almost continuous use of labor and farm machinery. The
projected size of civil works would permit sufficient flexibility to meet
the demand for irrigation water in accordance with the future cropping
patterns.

In the Romanian context, the cropping pattern excludes pastures, vineyards
and orchards, which are of a permanent nature and are not rotated with
annual crops. Government's recommended cropping pattern with the project
allocated 50% of the arable land to maize and 23% to wheat. With the
objective of reducing the winter wheat in favor of additional summer maize,
it was mutually agreed to fix maize at 54% and wheat at 19%. This pro-
portion of maize represents the highest level attained to date in Bank-
supported irrigation projects in Romania. The future area to be planted to

maize with the project exceeds the current area by 81%; whereas, wheat is
decreased by 9% and barley by 100%. Vegetables are introduced as a new
crop with the project and substantial increases of 35% and 27% are noted
for soybean and sugarbeet, respectively. Alfalfa area registers a marked
decrease of 83%; thereby achieving a better balanced overall cropping
pattern for the with-project situation. Sunflower, grapes and fruit remain
unchanged while natural pastures are eliminated and improved sown pastures
are introduced. Potatoes are reduced, being confined exclusively to the
sandy area. With the inclusion of second crop maize silage, following
wheat harvest, the cropping intensity reaches 119%.

The present cropping pattern contains about 10% more wheat and barley than
maize, no soybean and an insignificant amount of vegetables. With the
project, the situation changes. The new cropping pattern eliminates barley
and vetch; establishes 15% and 50% for wheat and maize, respectively; and
introduces soybean (8%) as a new crop. The new cropping pattern results in
significant changes in land utilization compared to pre-project. The wheat
area decreases 55% and maize increases 49%. Barley, vetch and natural
pastures are deleted entirely. Vegetables, alfalfa, sugarbeet and sun-
flower areas increase 183%, 48%, 24%, and 12%, respectively. With the
addition of second crop maize silage as a new crop the cropping intensity
increases to 115%.
Crop Yields
3.07     General.  The project implementation schedule provides for the
first irrigation to begin in 1984 for Titu and 1985 for Caracal sub--
projects. Hence, full development of crop yields and production will not
be realized until the late 1980s. Yield targets have been established
against this time frame bearing in mind the present yield levels; the
outlook for fertilizer availability, continuing inputs from the agricul-
tural research institutions in improvement of crop varieties and agronomic
practices and greater mechanization of farming operations, particularly
harvesting. Present yields are assumed to remain constant in the future
without the project since irrigation and drainage are the primary con-
straints to higher yields. With the elimination of these constraints under
the project, significant crop yield responses are expected. In this
regard, attention was focused on maize since over 50% of the arable land in
the project area is to be planted to this crop each year at full develop-
ment. Government's preparation report made yield projections of lOt/ha
for maize at full development. While it is conceivable that some agricul-
tural production units may attain yields of lOt/ha, appraisal, based on
available information, concluded that 8t/ha was a more realistic average
yield to be expected from the 62,000 ha of maize (excluding 4,000 ha of
sandy soil treated separately) to be planted annually on soils ranging from
Class I to Class IV. Similarly, the yield projections for wheat, soybean,
sunflower and sugarbeet, which account for about 38% of the total cropped
area, were based on results from existing irrigation schemes with similar
growing conditions. In all instances, maximum yield would be attained over
a period of four years based on a yearly gain of 30%, 70%, 90% and 100% of
the incremental yield.
3.08           Caracal.  Currently crop yields are low considering the
generally good soils prevalent in the area. The yield of selected crops
under varying conditions is presented below:

With modern irrigation and drainage works coupled with other essential
inputs, as fertilizer, seeds and mechanization, which are provided in the
project, significant yield responses can be expected. Results obtained on
the Caracal Research Station, despite coming from experimental plots, are
indicative of yield potentials for the area. Special mention is warranted
concerning an area of 4,000 ha of sandy soils characterized by rolling
dunes and interdunes. Because of its special characteristics, this area is
treated as a separate unit. Current crop yields in the sandy area are
considerably below those obtained in the bulk of the project area and the
target yields at full development are approximately 20% less.
3.09     Titu.  Generally, both rainfed and irrigated crop yields currently
obtained in this project area are lower than those in the Caracal area.
Typical examples are presented below;

This is a reflection of soil which is less productive and more deficient in
drainage given the present level of inputs. Based on all the crops (11) in

Livestock is important in the project area and many of the production units
are separate organizations with specialized personnel operating within the
framework of the existing State farms and cooperatives. There are seven
large, relatively new Inter-cooperative Associations, concerned with pro-
duction of pork, poultry meat and eggs, beef and breeding stock. Several
more of this type are planned for the future.
B. Agricultural Inputs
3.11     Mechanization.  Agricultural machinery is manufactured in
Romania. Tractors are being exported to a limited extent. Production is
standardized, thus facilitating operation and maintenance at farm level.
New farm equipment is developed and tested by the Institute for Agricul-
tural Mechanization under auspices of MAFI in close collaboration with the
manufacturers. The production program is tailored to the specific needs
of large scale farming. It includes tractors from 45 to 180 h.p., self-
propelled combines and harvesters and complex soil preparation and seeding
equipment. Land preparation and sowing, application of fertilizer and
other agricultural chemicals, small grain cereal harvesting, straw and hay
baling and transport are fully mechanized. In the Districts of the project
area, the percentage of maize mechanically harvested varies from 35% to
72%. These percentages are expected to increase markedly in the next two
years. Approximately 80% of the weeding requirement of row crops is done
mechanically and only the areas inaccessible to machines are hand weeded.
On the average for the project area, there is one tractor to 82 ha (12
tractors per 1,000 ha) and one cereal harvester to 325 ha (3 per 1,000



- 20 -
ha) 1/. These densities are slightly below the national average of 14
tractors and 4 cereal harvesters per 1,000 ha 2/. Large scale farm opera-
tions in the southern plains of Romania make use of agricultural machinery
essential for timely and full achievement of production targets. The
existing farm equipment is adequate for rainfed farming; however, addi-
tional equipment would be required to meet the requirements of the proposed
project. This additional equipment is being provided under the project to
improve the density to a maximum of 25 tractors and 5 cereal harvesters per
1,000 ha, depending upon the amount of worn-out equipment that the new
acquisitions will replace.
3.12     Labor.  Besides mechanization, manual labor is required for
various field crops and farming operations. There are two peak periods for
labor requirement: one in May for weeding, thinning sugarbeet and trans-
planting vegetables; and, the other in September-October for harvesting.
The available labor force in rural areas is shared between State farms and
cooperatives. Labor shortage currently is prevalent during the peak
periods. Annual labor requirements for the proposed project have been
estimated at about 2.8 million man-days. With additional provision of
harvesting machineries more than sufficient labor is available in the
project area to meet this demand.
3.13     Seeds.  Improved seeds for all project crops are available in
Romania and in sufficient quantities to meet project needs. Planting rates
per unit of area and seed price are fixed by MAFI. Seed development and
production is well organized. New crop varieties, developed by the
research scientists, are registered by a State commission only after a
minimum of three years testing in uniform, comparative small plot trials.
Subsequent multiplication of elite seed is entrusted to the research
stations and selected State and cooperative farms under the supervision of
a specialized State organization. In the project area there are 10 agri-
cultural units specialized in seed production. Processing, testing and
certification of seed meet international standards and maize and sunflower
seeds are exported.
3.14     Fertilizer.  Most fertilizer in Romania is applied as "straight"
materials, containing only a single primary plant nutrient element. Use of
"mixed" or compound fertilizer is less common. Several large important
fertilizer plants are located in the project area. Fertilizer requirements
and their allocation to IASs and CAPs are reviewed each year by MAFI and
the Chemical Industries Ministry. For the country as a whole a recent Bank
1/  These figures are an estimate since the territory covered by many SMAs,
which provide the tractor service, lies both within and outside the
project boundaries.

analysis revealed that the current fertilizer scarcity problem is expectea
to be largely eliminated by l985.  This is particularly true for nitrogen
(N) and phosphate (P205) while potash (K20) will probably continue
to be in deticit. The average annual requirement of fertilizer tor the
entire project, expressed as available nutrients, is approximately 22,000
tons of N, 14,000 tons of P205 and 6,000 tons of K20 Following
introduction of irrigation, the project area would receive priority in
allocation of fertilizer to the recommended levels to achieve production
targets. Assurances were obtained from Government to meet the tertilizer
requirements and to provide adequate equipment for fertilizer application
for the project area.
3.15     Plant Protection.  Regional research and forecasting stations
under MAFI advise CAPs and IASs on timely and appropriate plant protection
measures, which are carried out by the SMAs. In addition, within each
District Directorate for Agriculture there is a plant protection section
which deploys special equipment including planes for spraying insecticiae.
The Central Institute for Plant Protection in Bucharest conducts basic
research, long-term forecasting and new product testing; some ot which is
done on field scale basis in collaboration with IASs and CAPs. A wide
range of pesticides and herbicides are usea at a satistactory rate of
application. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that Govern-
ment would provide adequate spraying equipment tor the project area.
Agricultural Research and Extension
3.16     Research.  Agricultural research in Romania is coordinatea by the
Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences, and is conducted in 13
institutes, 6 central stations and 41 research stations. These research
facilities are distributed throughout the country's ecological zones and,
in the aggregate, cover about 80,000 ha. They are well staffed with over
1,600 scientists. The specific research needs and back-stopping for the
Caracal project area would be met principally by the Caracal Research
Station. The Station generates technology in irrigated crop production,
seed improvement, land reclamation, soil management, plant protection,
varietal improvement of crops and animal production, all of which is
applicable to 500,000 ha of leached chernozem soils in the region. The
Bank financed BBSP Irrigation Project provides for strengthening the
research facilities of this Station. The well established Central Research
Station for Sandy Soils in Bechet will provide support for the sub-area of
4,000 ha of sandy soils in the Caracal subproject area. Secondary inputs
would be forthcoming from the Research Station at Simnic in cereals and
industrial plants and in orchards, from the Circea Research Station, both
of which are in close proximity to the project area.  The prestigious
Research Institute for Cereals and Industrial Plants at Fundulea, near
Bucharest will be the main source of research input for the Titu project;
although the research Station at Albota, near Pitesti, with its emphasis on



- 22 -
reddish-brown podzolic soils also has relevance to the project area.
Additional support will be provided by the Research Institute for Pedology
and Agro-chemistry and the Agronomic Institute, both with headquarters in
Bucharest, although the latter has a pilot station on the northern fringe
of the project area.
3.17     Extension and Training.  Technical assistance is provided to the
agricultural production units either by their own supervisory specialists
or those attached to the office of the General Directorate for Agriculture
in each District. The following table indicates the total number of
specialists that are employed in the four Districts in which the Caracal
and Titu subprojects are located, and the outlook for the future (1985).
Thirty-nine percent (480) of the total (1,242) presently employed are
university graduates. The manpower at this level is expected to increase
by 16%. At the technician or middle level an 11% increase is planned.

One of the functions of the General Directorates of Agriculture is to coor-
dinate the production programs for the IASs and CAPs in accordance with
technical guidelines received from the MAFI. In this sense, the extension
staff has a direct say in improvement of cultural practices and the appli-
cation of technology instead of simply an advisory role. Research findings



- 23 -
pass rapidly into practice and the supervisory staff of the production
units adequately monitor their application. Training of both IAS and CAP
field staff is provided periodically by the General Directorates through
short and medium term courses. The research stations also play an impor-
tant role in training. For more specialized personnel, graduate courses
are organized during the off-season. Irrigation schemes and land reclama-
tion works near the project sites provide opportunities for gaining
practical experience with works similar to those under the project.
Agricultural Credit
3.18     The Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry (BAFI) is a State-owned
credit institution established in 1968 as the channel for and administrator
of investments and operations in agriculture, irrigation and agroindus-
tries, for State, cooperative, and, to a limited extent, individual
producers. BAFI's main source of funds is the short term borrowings from
the National Bank and the State budget. BAFI has also been the Borrower
for all Bank loans in support of agriculture and would be the Borrower for
the proposed loan. The principal responsibilities of BAFI are, to:
(a) act as fiscal agent for collection and distribution of State
budgetary funds;
(b) provide short-term production credit;
(c) review both technical and financial aspects of investment pro-
posals of State enterprises and cooperatives;
(d) provide long-term investment credit;
(e) exercise financial control over execution of investment and finan-
cial plans;
(f)  maintain deposit accounts for State enterprises and cooperatives;
and
(g) cooperate with foreign and international organizations to finance
investment in agriculture and agroindustries.
3.19     The Administrative Council is BAFI's policy-making body.  It is
composed of BAFI's President, Vice Presidents, Department Directors from
the Bucharest head office and major branches, economic and agricultural
experts, representatives of ministries and other central State agencies,
and a delegate designated by the General Trade Union of Romania. Between
the sessions of the Administrative Council, the Executive Bureau acts as
the decision-making body. Its members are the President, Vice Presidents,
three Department Directors and the trade union representative.
3.20     In addition to its headquarters in Bucharest, BAFI operates
through 39 district (judet) branches, 92 sub-branches and about 850 credit



- 24 -
cooperatives which serve as its agents for small-scale lending. Three
operational departments in the head office (agroindustries, Cooperative
sector, and State sector) serve enterprises of national importance
(centrals, trusts, research institutions). BAFI has four existing branches
and ten sub-branches in the project area with the following staff:

Total      556
The above BAFI branches and sub-branches, and the support staff that is
familiar with other Bank financed agricultural projects are sufficient to
administer, disburse and supervise the proposed loan. The Caracal and Titu
sub-branches will have the primary field responsibility for supervision.
C. Marketing and Processing Facilities
Marketing Channel
3.21     Marketing of agricultural products in Romania is entrusted to
State owned and operated marketing centrals established in the late 1960's
to assist MAFI in the procurement, grading, processing, storage and dis-
tribution of agricultural products. Currently there are 13 Centrals which
specialize in marketing specific commodities such as cereals, vegetables
and fruits, sugar, meat, etc. With the exception of the sugar Central,
each Central has its headquarters in Bucharest and an enterprise in each of
the country's 39 judets. The enterprises are the executing agencies of the
Centrals at the District level. The transportation trusts in the District
Directorate of Agriculture coordinate the transportation of farm products
to the collection centers. The Centrals bear the cost of transport. The



- 25 -
Central for sugar owns and operates 17 sugar factories responsible for col-
lection, storing, processing and distributing sugarbeet.
3.22     Delivery contracts with the production enterprises are entered for
periods ranging from one to five years. These contracts would specify;
(a) quantity; (b) unit price; (c) agro-technical condition of the produce;
(d) place of delivery; and (e) phasing of delivery. In the case of sugar,
for deliveries in excess of the contracted quantity, the sugar enterprises
make bonus payments. However, penalties are not levied for failing to
supply the agreed quantities. The Horticulture enterprises have different
procedures and the producers will be penalized for failing to meet the
target deliveries and the prices will be reduced if deliveries are delayed
by more than ten days. In order to encourage producers, the Horticulture
Central allows bonus payments for areas cultivated over and above the
agreed land area in the initial contract. Because of labor constraints,
Agricultural enterprises limit the areas under vegetable to the minimum.
3.23     The marketing enterprises operating in the Districts of the proj-
ect area are presented below.

Both the enterprises and collection centers are adequately staffed and
satisfactorily operated to handle the incremental production from the pro-
posed project.
Processing and Storage Facilities
3.24     Existing processing capacities in the project area are operating
at about 80% capacity. However due to lack of raw material supply the
processing period is very short. Hence very moderate capacity expansions
are envisaged during the sixth Five Year Plan (1981-1985). The existing
and future processing capacities are given below:

It should be noted that there is a great deal of inter District transfer
of raw material for processing.  The incremental sugarbeet output from
Dimbovita area would be processed in neighboring Ilfov District.  Simi-
larly sunflower and soybean production would also be processed in Ilfov
District. With higher utilization rate of existing plants and marginal
capacity expansions, adequate facilities would be available to process
the incremental output.
3.25           In the project area the primary storage requirements are for
cereal. Various types of storages including modern silos and locally
designed make-shift storages (corn lifts and corn lofts) are used in
Romania. Crop loss in using the make shift storages is estimated at about
3%. Present and projected cereal storage capacities in the Districts of
the project area are shown below:

3.26     During negotiations assurances were also obtained that Government
would supply the cultivators in the project area with agricultural, tech-
nical and advisory services, seeds, agricultural credit, marketing facili-
ties and other agricultural inputs all as required to make optimal produc-
tive use of such area.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01     The principal objective of the project is to increase agricultural
production and to promote a sustained growth through provision of irriga-
tion and drainage facilities and other ancillary works. The project
further aims at substantially improving productivity of land and labor in
the project area.
B. Detailed Features
4.02     The project area is located in two separate valleys, the Caracal
subproject being on the west bank of the lower reach of the Olt river and
the Titu subproject on the two banks of the middle reach of the Arges.
Summary of proposed project works is shown below.

4.03     Detailed description of proposed project works is given in
Annex 2. Irrigation and drainage systems are shown in Maps IBRD No. 15407
and No. 15408. Design criteria for the irrigation and drainage works are
essentially similar to those used in previous Bank assisted irrigation
projects.
4.04     Equipment for application of irrigation water to the fields,
operation and maintenance of irrigation systems and farm machinery are also
provided under the project.
C. Water Requirements, Availability, Quality and Water Rights
4.05     Water Requirements.  Water requirements for the project crops have
been estimated separately for each subproject area. The coefficients used
for different crops and soil types have been derived from actual data on



- 29 -
water use collected for a number of years at different agricultural
research stations. Based on experience of similar previously completed
projects, the irrigation efficiency of the sprinkler irrigated area has
been estimated at 80% and for the furrow irrigated area at 70% for both
subprojects. Since 16% of the project area is to be furrow irrigated and
84% sprinkler irrigated in the Caracal subproject, an overall efficiency of
78.4% has been applied to determine the gross water requirements. In the
case of Titu, with 73% furrow and 27% sprinkler irrigation, an overall
efficiency of 72.7% has been used. In addition, a weighted average was
calculated for the water requirement of each crop in the Titu area based on
41% of the project area coming under the influence of the Bucharest-F'ilaret
meteorological station and 59% under the Titu station. A summary of the
net and gross water requirements annually and for July, the month of
highest demand, is presented below:
Estimated Water Requirements
July        Annual          July        Annual
-------m3/ha ------        -------Mm3-------
Caracal      Net             1,256        3,260           107.9         279.3
Gross          1,602        4,158           137.6         356.3
Titu         Net               923        2,598            38.2         107.6
Gross          1,270         3,574           52.5         148.0
Irrigation requirements would be maximum in July.  The system is designed
to meet the July demand of 52 m3/s for Caracal and 19.25 m3/s for
Titu. The details of estimated water requirements for the specific
cropping pattern in each subproject are shown in Annex 3, Tables T-1 and
T-2.
Water Availability
4.06     Caracal.  The river Olt, in its 90 kms from the Danube, would have
five dams - Ipotesti, Draganesti, Funzaru, Rusanesti and Isbicenci, the
first two now under construction and the construction of the other 3 to
be commenced shortly. These storages would provide navigation, temporary
flood retention above the normal reservoir level and power generation
only in the periods of surplus flow in the Olt. The turbines would be
reversible to pump water from the Danube, to meet irrigation shortages
on the systems planned to be irrigated from the Olt flows covering the
ultimate 670,000 ha. In the next 110 kms, eleven dams are existing, and
two are under construction. These dams are essentially for power genera-
tion and utilize the entire drop in the 110 kms, but the turbines permit
lowering of reservoir by 2 meters only at each. Irrigation requirements
could thus be met from the storage in the upper 2 metres of the reservoirs
if power generation is not to be affected. The dams also provide temporary
flood detention above the normal storage level. In the hilly region beyond
200 kms, there are a few dams on the tributaries which are operated essen-
tially for power generation. Other major storages are proposed in the



- 30 -
upper catchment. The National Water Council has carried out a recent study
for the water availability for irrigation with the dams in the 200 kms of
the Olt, subject to the constraints of meeting the industry and domestic
water requirements and not affecting power generation. The study shows
that with the utilization of most of the Draganesti storage and not
lowering the upper reservoirs below minimum powerpool, it is possible to
irrigate 191,000 ha with 80% availability of water. This would include
66,220 ha of current irrigation from the Olt, additional 28,000 ha of
Bucsani and 84,500 ha of Caracal. Water would thus be available for
Caracal project as soon as the Draganesti dam is completed. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that the Draganesti Dam would be com-
pleted by December 31, 1984 to permit timely irrigation of the Caracal sub-
project. Further assurance was also obtained from Government to make suit-
able arrangements for review of design, construction and operation of the
Draganesti dam by independent qualified experts acceptable to the Bank.
4.07     Titu.  The Arges river is the major source for meeting the indus-
trial and domestic requirements of the towns of Bucharest and Pitesti.
With the existing storages in the upper catchment, the river provides
industrial and domestic supplies at a constant rate of 22 m3/sec throughout
the year, meets the irrigation requirements of 47,000 ha and power is
generated in winter. With increasing irrigation demands, additional 7,000
ha irrigation is being planned by reducing winter power generation. Two
dams - Golesti and Riusor - are under construction, their completion would
allow the industrial and domestic supply to be met up to 26.1 m3/sec and
irrigation could be extended to another 44,200 ha, with 80% availability.
Water would therefore be available for the Titu subproject. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that the Golesti and Riusor dams would be
completed by December 31, 1983 and December 31, 1984 respectively to permit
commissioning of irrigation in the Titu subproject by the scheduled dates.
Similar assurance was also obtained from Government to make suitable
arrangements for review of design, construction and operation of Golesti
and Riusor dams by independent qualified experts acceptable to the Bank.
4.08     Water Quality.  Analysis of samples of water, collected from the
Olt and Arges, shows that these waters are suitable for irrigation. Main
quality indicators are:
Olt       Arges
TDS (PPM)                     543        320
SAR                          1.75       2.29
PH                           7.20       6.75
Water Rights
4.09     The Olt is a tributary of the Danube which forms an important
waterway with international rights. Contribution to the Danube flow by the
Olt is maximum in the spring floods when the Danube itself has high water.



- 31 -
During the irrigation season, contribution by the Olt is less than 100
m3/sec for about 50% of the time. The Danube minimum flow being about 2000
m3/sec, complete diversion of flow for irrigation would mean a reduction of
less than 5%, which will not affect navigation. In fact, withdrawals will
be made in future from the Danube during irrigation seasons in those years
when irrigation water from Olt would be inadequate to meet the needs of the
670,000 ha planned to be irrigated. During negotiations, Government
furnished a letter of representation to the Bank, assuring that withdrawals
from the Olt river would not cause problems with other riparian states.
4.10     The Arges is also a tributary of the Danube.  However, the Arges,
becomes almost dry in the non-flood months after its water is diverted for
irrigation, industrial use and drinking water supply. During floods only,
Arges contributes to Danube flow which is insignificant compared to high
Danube discharge. Building of storages on the Arges would only reduce the
flow going down to Danube in the flood season, when the Danube itself is at
breakflow.
D. Status of Engineering
4.11     The Caracal subproject has been studied in detail.  Nine alter-
native layouts were considered for the irrigation system and the selected
alternative is the most appropriate and economical and is acceptable to the
Bank. Topographical surveys have been completed for all the canal align-
ments and structures and detailed drawings completed for a few structures.
Detailed design and drawings of major structures are being done and con-
struction drawings are planned to be completed well ahead of commencement
of their construction.
4.12     The Titu subproject detailed designs and drawings of major struc-
tures are already complete. The layout adopted is acceptable to the Bank.
Detailed construction drawings would be completed ahead of the commencement
of construction.
E. Cost Estimates
4.13     The total project cost including physical and price contingencies
but net of taxes and duties is estimated at lei 5,689.9 million ($379.3
million), and is based on the December 1980 prices for materials and wages,
which are regulated by the State. The foreign exchange component is esti-
mated at lei 1,399.4 million (US$93.2 million) or 24.6% of the total cost.
Physical contingencies have been provided at 7.5% since the quantities have
been based on detailed specification drawings. Price contingencies on
foreign costs are compounded annually at 9% (1981), 8.5% (1982), 7.5%
(1983-5). Price contingencies for local costs are compounded at 2% per



- 32 -
year. In the past, Romania domestic prices have been increasing at less
than one percent per annum. However, since there are indications that
there may be minor price adjustments during project implementation, local
price contingencies have been raised to two percent per annum. This
corresponds to the Romanian assumption on the rise of the retail price
index for the 1981 annual plan. Detailed cost estimates for Caracal and
Titu subprojects are given in Annex 4 Tables T-1 and T-2.

F. Financing Plan
4.14      In accordance with Romanian law, the State will finance 100% of
the total costs of main canals and drains, all pumping stations, drainage,
and river training works. First-time levelling, ripping, and soil reclama-
tion will also be State-financed, but subsequent works of this type will be



- 33 
financed by the respective CAP or IAS. State funds for investment will be
channelled through BAFI or allocated through the budget to IELIF.  The
costs of buried pipeline, on-farm sprinkler and furrow equipment, and small
secondary open drainage canals serving CAP-owned lands will be borne by the
CAPs partly through BAFI loans and partly through their own contributions.
Farm machinery will be financed from the State budget through allocations
to the SMAs.
4.15     The proposed bank loan of US$80 million, to be made to BAFI, will
finance about 21% of total project cost (US$379.3 million), equivalent to
about 86% of the estimated foreign exchange cost (UV$93.3 million). With
subborrowers' contribution of 3% and BAFI loans of 8% of total project
costs, the remaining 68% will be financed by the Government. Government
has agreed in principle to pursue cofinancing for about US$100.0 million.
Since cofinancing has been obtained for 3 agriculture Drojects, the
prospects for cofinancing on this loan are good. The proposed Bank loan
would be made for a term of 15 years, including 3 years grace. The Govern-
ment of Romania would bear the foreign exchange risk. A summary financing
plan which includes physical and price contingencies is shown in Annex 5.
G. Procurement
4.16     Equipment and materials would be procured under the proposed
loan. During negotiations it was agreed that items costing US$80 million
including contingencies would be procured following international advertis-
ing and competitive bidding in accordance with the "Guidelines for Procure-
ment under World Bank loans and IDA Credits - March 1977." Romanian manu-
facturers would be allowed a preference of 15% or the applicable customs
duty, whichever is lower. The application of preference has affected so
far the outcome of bidding on previous irrigation projects in a few cases,
and is not expected to significantly affect the result of bidding on the
proposed project. It is expected that foreign suppliers would win con-
tracts for about 5% of ICB procurement, mobile concrete pumps, truck
cranes, and canal trimming and lining machines) estimated to cost about
US$4.0 million. Other items to be procured through international competi-
tive bidding (about US$76.0 million) are available domestically and, based
on experience with previous Bank-financed irrigation projects, it is
expected that the Romanian manufacturers would be successful in bidding for
those items. The list of equipment to be procured under ICB is given in
Annex 6. The remaining equipment and materials, all domestically produced,
would be procured under Romanian procedures and would not be eligible for
disbursements under the proposed Bank loan. The Banik would not finance
construction works under the project. The work would be carried out by the
Romanian Constructions Trusts, which are experienced and familiar with
local conditions, methods and regulations. This practice has been accept-
able to the Bank for the previous Bank-financed projects because due to the



- 34 -
regulated wages and prices of materials, the Romanian construction costs
are likely to be less than those which might be bid by international
contractors.
H. Disbursements
4.17     The proposed Bank loan of US$80 million would be disbursed net of
taxes over five years as follows:
Equipment, materials and spare          100% of foreign expenditures
parts for irrigation works              or 100% of local expenditures
(US$80.0 million)                       ex-factory.
4.18     Disbursement applications would be supported by standard documen-
tation.  Schedule of disbursements is estimated as follows and a detailed
schedule by Bank fiscal year and quarter is given in Annex 7, Table T-1.

I.  Implementation Schedule
4.19     The project works would be completed in 4 years (1982 to 1985) in
accordance with the implementation schedule (Chart 1). Irrigation would
commence in 1984 and would cover the entire area by 1987. An estimated
schedule of expenditure is given in Annex 8, Tables T-1 and T-2 and is
summarized below:
Calendar Year                    1982    1983    1984    1985    1986         1987

- 35 -
J. Investment Financing
4.20     IAS investments are primarily financed by State budget (channelled
through IELIF for irrigation schemes). BAFI credits are only used for
small scale investments. Interest rates on BAFI investment loans to IAS's
are 2% during construction and 4% thereafter with a penalty interest rate
of 6% for delayed payments. The maximum repayment period for IAS loans is
10 years.
4.21     Investments by CAPs are primarily financed through BAFI credits
which may finance up to 95% of projects costs, depending on the financial
strength of the CAP. The average BAFI loan is about 25-30% of investments
by CAPs. CAPs use their own resources (Development Fund) when possible to
cover proposed investments. Interest rates on BAFI investment loans to
CAPs are 3% with a penalty rate of 6%. Repayment periods for CAP invest-
ment loans depend on the type of investment and range between 8 and 25
years.
K. Cost Recovery
4.22     BAFI Loans.  Direct BAFI loans are only made to CAPs amounting to
lei 480 millionTU_S$32.0 million) or 8% of the project cost.  These loans
would be recovered in accordance with standard on-lending terms derived
from established amortization practices. For on-farm buried pipelines, the
loans would be for 25 years including 5 years of grace, and for on-farm
irrigation equipment, 12 years including 3 years of grace. The interest
rate would be 3% including interest during construction with penalty rate
for payment of up to 6%.
4.23     Budgetary Allocations.  The balance of the project cost is
financed through budgetary allocation to IELIF and SMA and CAPs contribu-
tion. Most of the investment expenditures in IAS will be recovered
indirectly through the compulsory portion of net income paid into Deprecia-
tion Fund. Costs are also recovered indirectly from CAPs through the com-
pulsory portions of net incomes allocated to the Development Fund. Both
Funds are compulsory savings mechanisms under which funds are set aside for
future investments. The cost of farm machinery would be recovered by the
State through unit rates paid by IASs and CAPs to SNMAs for mechanical
services which cover the SMA contributions to the Depreciation Fund.
4.24     The annual O&M costs for the whole project are estimated at about
lei 131 million (US$8.7 million) or an average of lei 1,030 per ha. The
present value of investments, O&M, and replacement costs discounted over
40 years at 9% is about lei 4700.0 million (US$313.0 million). O&M
maintenance costs are recovered directly by IELIF through water charges of
three types levied on all CAPs and IASs using irrigation water. These are:



- 36 -
(a) a variable charge ot lei 18 (US$1.20) per 1,000 m3 levied on the
volume of water used. This would yield an income ot lei 9.1 mil-
lion p.a.;
(b)  a fixed annual charge per ha on the basis ot crops grown.  The
estimated recovery from this charge would be about lei 18.1 mil-
lion; and
(c) a fixed charge per ha levied on the basis ot type ot irrigation
method used. The return from this levey would be lei 17.3 million.
These direct water charges would yield an annual revenue of about lei 44.5
million (US$3.0 million) beginning with year 7 (1987), at full implementa-
tion of the project. The present value of this recovery over an assumed
project life of 40 years in constant prices and at a discount rate of 9% is
estimated at about lei 321.5 million (US$21.4 million). The resulting cost
recovery would amount to about 7% of the total project costs (Investment,
replacement, operation and maintenance) discounted at 9%. Indirect
recovery from the incremental net income payments to the State in the form
of taxes and required contributions to development funds annually would be
about lei 178.2 million (US$11.9 million). The present value of these
payments at a discount rate ot 9% is estimated at lei 1208.5 million
(US$80.6 million). These indirect recovery costs would cover 26% of total
project costs. The direct and indirect recovery ot costs would equal 33%
of total project costs. In addition, the substantial protits (estimated at
US$260.0 million) made by the State trom the purchase ot tradeable commodi-
ties at administered low farmgate prices and subsequent export at higher
world prices to the economy resulting from incremental project output would
contribute further towards the project's cost recovery and with their
inclusion, the total recovery would exceed 100%.
L. Role of Women
4.25     The proposed Caracal-Titu Irrigation Project does not have a
specific component to address women in development. In Romania, access to
equal educational opportunity is universal irrespective of sex. Hence
women are taking active part in all spheres of economic activity and many
skilled occupations have women representation. In 1978 full-time employed
women accounted for about 14% of total agricultural labor force. In the
project area, the share of women workers (including seasonal workers) range
from 59% in Dimbovita District to 67% in Olt. In the agricultural enter-
prises of the project area, women professionals account for about 30% ot
the high level positions. The number of women senior staff is shown below.

4.26     With increasing mechanization of agriculture (particularly combine
harvesters) the physical burden on women engaged in manual harvesting would
be alleviated substantially. In addition, the provision of irrigation
facilities to individually owned plots would increase family income and
improve consumption diet.
M. Environment and Health
4.27     The project area is free of endemic diseases like malaria and
bilharzia. The project would neither adversely affect the environment nor
the public health. The environment would be improved in the Caracal area
through reclamation of sandy soils and control of soil erosion. Drainage
measures and improving the valleys for efficient drainage would promote
healthier conditions. The construction of water retention and conveyance
structures would not provide mosquito breeding as the supplies would keep
fluctuating.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. The Borrower
5.01     BAFI would be the borrower under the guarantee of the Socialist
Republic of Romania. BAFI has the prime responsibility for financing the
development of the agricultural sector. BAFI already has adequate legal,
financial and administrative power to discharge its responsibilities effec-
tively (para. 3.18). BAFI is the borrower for all Bank loans to the agri-
cultural sector.



- 38 -
B. Implementing Agencies
5.02     MAFI has the overall responsibility for planning, designing, con-
struction, supervision, operation and maintenance of all irrigation, drain-
age and soil erosion control works. MAFI and its affiliate agencies have
been the executing agencies for all Bank assisted agricultural projects and
perform satisfactorily. Organizational chart of MAFI and related project
implementing agencies is presented in Chart III.
5.03     Economic General Directorate for Land Reclamation and Agricultural
Construction (DGEIFCA). The responsibility for planning, design and con-
struction of project works would rest with DGEIFCA, which is headed by a
Deputy Minister, and is organized into the following four directorates:
(a)  Technical, Investment and Cooperation Directorate.  ISPIF, which
is under this directorate, would be responsible for the planning
and design of the project.
(b)  Construction and Land Development Directorate.  Construction
Trusts for Land Reclamation Works (TCIF), belonging to this
directorate and their regional branches would undertake project
construction;
(c) Planning and Finance Directorate; and
(d) Supply Directorate.
All the above units of DGEIFCA are adequately staffed and have good past
experience in carrying out similar works.
5.04     Foreign Trade State Enterprise for Cooperation, Engineering,
Import and Export for Agriculture and Food Industry (Romagrimex) would be
responsible for procurement to be arranged under the project as under the
previous Bank assisted agricultural projects.
5.05     The Ministry of Electrical Energy, through its subordinate enter-
prises and their units, is responsible for construction, operation and
maintenance of power transmission facilities, and for supplying energy to
the project area.
5.06     Assurances were obtained from Government that MAFI and its affili-
ate agencies and the Ministry of Electrical Energy would carry out the
construction, operation and maintenance of project works diligently and
efficiently.
C. Operation and Maintenance and Supervision of Construction
5.07     The irrigation, drainage and soil erosion control works, to be
constructed under the project would be operated and maintained by the



- 39 -
Directorate for Exploitation of Land Reclamation Works (DELIF) which is
headed by a Deputy Minister of MAFI and has the responsibility for opera-
tion and maintenance of all completed irrigation projects. DELIF has 17
operational units, called Enterprise for Exploitation of Land Resources
(IELIFs) which are based on districts. Each IELIF has several sub-units,
known as Systems; each System maintains an area of up to 40,000 ha of irri-
gated land. Two new systems would be set up for the Caracal subproject and
one system for the Titu subproject. The new systems would be adequately
staffed by trained technicians and supervisors. Equipment for operation
and maintenance (Annex 6) to be furnished by the Project would be handed
over to the IELIF in the two districts of Olt and Ilfov. The power supply
works would be maintained by the Ministry of Energy. The on-farm portable
equipment would be maintained by the farm entities, and the farm machinery
would be maintained by the established Agroindustrial Councils.
D. Accounts and Audit
Audit and Control System
5.08     To support its highly centralized decision-making process, Romania
has an elaborate control and audit system designed to keep the manager of
the economy advised on the progress of, and deviation from, planned activi-
ties. This control system has three major objectives: (i) to audit
accounts to ensure accurate financing status; (ii) to determine that
resources are being used in accordance with national plans; and (iii) to
recommend desirable changes in resource use.
5.09     The system is organized like a pyramid.  At the top is the Court
of Superior Control, while at the bottom are accountants who check and
approve routine transactions at the enterpise level. The numerous organi-
zations perform either "Internal Control" or "External Control". These
controls can further be divided into two broad categories: the preliminary
control which covers day-to-day transactions; and the posterior control
which resembles annual audits. Thus an enterprise, during a period of
one year, is inspected by: (i) its own chief accounts officer; (ii) the
internal controller, who reports both to the general manager of the Central
and Minister concerned; (iii) controllers from the Ministry of Finance who
report to the Ministry of Finance; and (iv) inspectors from the Court of
Superior Control. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that a
report on project account and annual financial statements of BAFI, audited
by the Ministry of Finance would be submitted to the Bank annually within
six months of the Romanian fiscal year.
E. Project Monitoring and Completion Report
5.10     Project Monitoring and Key Project Indicators.  BAFI would be
responsible for submitting through quarterly and annual reports to the



- 40 -
Bank, the information necessary to measure systematically project execution
against the proposed implementation schedule, and project performance after
completion of construction against project benefits foreseen during
appraisal. The reports would be similar to those currently submitted for
on-going projects and would include data on the progress of construction of
all physical facilities under various project components, development of
irrigation, drainage, soil erosion control areas and other works, progress
in the procurement of equipment and materials, and data on project expendi-
tures. Agricultural data indicating the areas reclaimed, drained and
brought under irrigation, cropping patterns adopted, level of inputs
applied and yields attained would be submitted annually. The details of
format in which the above information would be supplied to the Bank were
discussed during negotiations and assurances were sought on their timely
provision.
5.11     Project Completion Report.  Promptly after completion of the proj-
ect but no later than June 30, 1986, BAFI would prepare and furnish to the
Bank a report on the execution and initial operation of the project, its
costs and the benefits derived and to be derived from it, the performance
by the Bank and BAFI of their respective obligations under the proposed
loan. The detailed contents of the report were discussed during nego-
tiations and assurance were obtained on its timely preparation during
negotiations.
VI. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Project Benefits
6.01     The proposed Caracal-Titu Irrigation Project accounts for about
17% of the planned incremental area to be irrigated in the sixth Five Year
Plan (1981-1985). It would transform presently rainfed lands into highly
productive agricultural zone. At full development, in 1990, crop and
by-products output with and without project situation are summarized below:

6.02     Under the Caracal subproject, provision is made for valley train-
ing works and small flood retention dams. These works would mitigate
annual flood damages estimated at lei 10 million (US$0.7 million). The
benefits from these works are included in the economic analysis.



- 42 -
B. Prices and Markets
Pricing Structure
6.03     Because of the nature of economic management in Romania, the
pricing system plays a much less important role than it does in market
economies. Prices are fixed by Government and rarely vary in response to
changes in demand and supply. They only vary according to quality of
products and in some instances according to delivery date. Prices may also
vary by zone but are common within each zone. Domestic prices reflect
subsidized input prices including low cost of labor and fuel. Present
prices have not changed significantly over a period of about fifteen
years. Some upward revision occurred in 1977/78 which coincided with the
revaluation of the lei from 20 to 18 vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar. Government
has also announced further revaluation of the lei to 15 from January 1,
1981.
6.04     Despite the new measures taken to reorganize the agricultural
units (para. 1.2), Romania still maintains two tier pricing system for IASs
and CAPs. IASs pay lower input prices than CAPs and get lower output
prices than CAPs. Domestic prices of vegetables, potatoes, fruits, sugar-
beet and grapes are fixed by grades and dates of delivery. They vary
between a maximum for early delivery and superior quality and a minimum
for later delivery and poor quality but cannot exceed or undercut these
limits. IASs are required to deliver all their products to the State
marketing enterprises or their sub-units. CAPs, however, make their
deliveries based on contracts signed with the marketing agencies at the
beginning of each cropping season. The contracting quantities are estab-
lished after subtracting food and feed needs for human and livestock con-
sumption, ensuring seed requirements and setting aside payments in kind for
members and the SMA.
Markets
6.05     The incremental production of cereals, vegetables, fruits and
livestock feed crops would be destined for the growing domestic markets,
augment export volumes and substitute for current imports.
6.06     Cereals.  At full development, maize production would increase
by 298% and wheat by 35%. These output gains are attributable to yield
improvements of maize and wheat and expansion of maize lands (paras 3.4,
3.5 and 3.6). Romania has generally been a surplus producer of wheat and
maize generating total exports of 0.7 million tons in 1978. With the
growing livestock development program in the 1980's, the project would help
meet domestic requirements including substitutes for high priced feed
concentrate imports and continue to generate exportable surpluses. BAFI's
projection of maize output in 1985 is about 15 million tons. Assuming that
80% (12 million tons) would be available for animal feed and an estimated
10 million tons would be required for domestic livestock development, the



- 43 -
balance of 2 million tons could be exported. World Bank's projection of
world maize export in 1985 is about 68 million tons of which Romania could
account for 2 million tons or 3% of total exports. Romania's share of
maize exports would probably increase to about 5% in 1990 when most of the
large scale irrigation project would be fully operated. Romania has ample
market opportunities both in W. Europe and COMECON countries particularly
the Soviet Union.
6.07     Oilseeds.  Under the proposed cropping pattern, soybean and sun-
flower would constitute 13.6% of the total crop land compared to 9.7% under
present situation. Romania is deficient in protein source crops which is
affecting livestock productivity. Feed conversion ratio of poultry is
currently well below international standards on account of low protein feed
content. The incremental production from the proposed project wouldi sub-
stitute for major import requirements and save foreign exchange. By 1985
Romania would still import 20-25% (same as 1979 share) of its protein meal
supply.
6.08     Sugarbeet.  The incremental output of sugarbeet of about 244,000
tons equivalent to 32,000 tons of sugar would be consumed domestically.
Present level of per capita consumption of sugar is about 28 kg and
expected to increase to 34 kg in 1985. The per capita consumption Level
would still be below the current consumption levels in other East European
countries. Romania is a net importer of sugar.
6.09     Fruits and Vegetables.  The areas under orchards and vineyards
would remain constant. Higher output levels would be attained through
annual replantings, provision of irrigation and fertilizer and herbicide
applications. Output of both orchards and vineyards would double from the
present levels. The incremental production would be marketed in the urban
centers of the project area. Annual Romanian exports of vegetables is
estimated at about 200,000 tons mainly to neighboring East European coun-
tries. Of the total vegetable production in Romania, 60% is processed, 35%
is consumed fresh and about 5% is exported fresh. The vegetable output
from the proposed project would account for less than 2% of total Romanian
production. Per capita consumption of fresh vegetables is estimated at 160
kg in 1980 and planned to reach 200 kg in 1985.
6.10     Fodder Crops.  At present there are 152 livestock farms in the
project area (para. 2.8). By 1990 the number of farms is expected to
reach 164 with modernized facilities. The incremental output of alfalfa
pastures, vetch and hay would be consumed in the project area.
C. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
6.11     Benefits.  The proposed project would boost agricultural produc-
tion through intensive and more efficient utilization of land, water and
other factors of production. At full development, i.e. in 1990, the direct
net incremental financial benefits from the agricultural activities is



- 44 -
estimated at US$41.9 million annually. The net return per hectare of agri-
cultural land would increase from US$62 without the project to US$329 with
full operation of the project. Detailed tables on net returns for the
Caracal and Titu subprojects are presented in Annex 9, Tables T-1 to T-ll.
In addition, the project would also mitigate flood damages estimated at
about lei 10 million per year. Moreover, presently underemployed agricul-
tural workers would be fully employed complimented by adequate machinery
services. The annual labor requirement in the project area at full devel-
opment is estimated at 2.8 million man-days. During project implementa-
tion, about 5,000 temporary and 1200 permanent jobs would also be created.
6.12     Beneficiaries.  An estimated 78,000 CAP members and IAS employees
would beneift from the proposed project. Workers' remuneration in the
socialized agricultural sector is based on a set of salary norms estab-
lished nationally. Bonus payments are made when planned production targets
are surpassed. With the provision of irrigation and drainage facilities,
the production targets in the project area would be revised upward. How-
ever, the incomes of the project area agricultural workers would only be
raised through a national income policy. Nevertheless production from
private plots assigned to individual CAP members would raise their income
level appreciably.
D. Economic Analysis
6.13     The economic rate of return of the project to the economy of
Romania is estimated at 20%. The net present values of benefits discounted
at 9% over 40 years would rise from US$341.7 million without project to
US$692.9 million with project. A summary of ERRs and NPVs for Caracal and
Titu subprojects and the whole project is presented below.
Subproject        ERR          NPV
(%)    (US$ million)
Caracal         20.3      247.1
Titu            18.3      104.1
Total Project  19.5       351.2
6.14     The assumptions underlying the estimated economic rates of return
are:
(a) Investment Costs. Total project cost is estimated based on unit
rates prevailing in December 1980. For the purpose of the eco-
nomic analysis the investment cost stream has been adjusted to
reflect the real resource cost incurred by the economy. From the
financial project cost, the following items have been excluded:
(i) price contingencies - as the analysis is in constant 1980
prices and it is assumed that expected investment costs would rise
at the same rate as international inflation; (ii) cost of farm
machinery - since the cost of machinery services is included in



- 45 -
the production cost stream; and (iii) land compensation - the
production foregone from the areas taken by project works reflects
the cost of compensation. The economic cost of the proposed
project also includes the cost of the storage dams attributable to
irrigation. The respective costs allocated to irrigation have
been approved by Government. The Draganesti dam on the Olt river
would cost lei 1170 million and lei 293 million (25%) is costed to
the proposed Caracal subproject. Similarly, both Golesti and
Riusor dams on the Arges river are multipurpose including irriga-
tion. Hence future expenditures to be incurred for the completion
of the dams have been prorated among different users. Estimated
cost of the two dams is lei 1447 million and lei 220 milliorn (15%)
is allocated to irrigation. Expenditures incurred to date would
also be considered as sunk costs.
(b) Operation, Maintenance and Replacement Costs. At full operation
of project works annual O&M costs of pumping stations, storage
dams irrigation and drainage systems and power costs are estimated
at lei 1,065 (US$71) and lei 966 (US$64) per ha for Caracal and
Titu subprojects respectively. The weighted average O&M cost for
the project is lei 1,035 or US$69 per ha. The Titu subproject
requires minimal pumping. Replacement costs have also been
provided every ten years for on-farm equipments and every twenty
years for pumps. Breakdown of O&M and replacement costs is given
in Annex 10.
(c) Project Execution. Project works for the two subprojects would
commence in 1982 and Caracal would be completed in 1985 and Titu
in 1984. Since the Draganesti dam is scheduled for completion in
1984 the first irrigation on parts of the Caracal subproject area
would start in 1985. In the Titu subproject the Golesti dam will
be completed in 1983 and Riusor dam would be commissioned in 1984
and 50% of the subproject area would be irrigated in 1984. In
1981 preparation for project sites would be initiated. Land
development and phasing of project works are presented in Chart I.
(d) Agricultural Practices. The cropping pattern recommended and
yield projections and supporting agricultural inputs are discussed
in Chapter III.
(e) Input Prices. Based on Bank's Commodity Price Forecasts, farmgate
prices of traded inputs have been derived. Romania being a net
exporter of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers, export parity
prices are applicable. However, Romania is net importer of
potassium fertilizers, and import parity price has been derived.
All other inputs including labor are valued at the prevailing
domestic market prices. List of input prices is presented in
Annex 11.
(f) Output Prices. The proposed cropping pattern has a range of
products expected to augment current exports, substitute for
imports and incease non-tradeable commodities. The tradeable



- 46 -
commodities would account for over 85% of the agricultural
benefits. While maize, wheat and orchards are valued at export
parity, sugarbeet, soybeans, and sunflower, prices are based on
import parity equivalents adjusted for transport and handling
charges. The price projections are based on Bank's Commodity
Price Forecasts in constant 1980 prices. The non-tradeables viz.
fodder are valued at the established domestic prices. Financial
and economic output prices are given in Annex 12.
6.15     The economic cash flows for Caracal, Titu and the whole project
are presented in Annex 13, Tables T-1, T-2 and T-3. Although the Caracal
subproject has similar project design as Bucsani subproject (BBSP Irriga-
tion VII) located north of Caracal, the estimated ERR is slightly lower
than for Bucsani. The major difference which explains this variation is
the timing of project execution and development. In the case of Bucsani
land development commences a year after project work begins. However, in
the case of Caracal because of the schedule of Draganesti's dam completion,
water will not be available before the fourth year of the project. Simi-
larly, the Titu subproject on the Golesti and Riusor dams can only start
generating benefits in the third year of the project construction period.
The ERR difference between Caracal and Titu can be attributed largely to
changes in the future cropping pattern (paras. 3.4 and 3.5) and proportion
of present area under irrigation. In the Caracal subproject only 4% of the
present area is irrigated compared to 14% in Titu (which would depress the
incremental benefits).
Sensitivity Analysis and Risks
6.16     Sensitivity tests were conducted to observe the project's
resilience to possible changes in selected variables. The sensitivity
analysis indices signify the percentage changes from the appraisal values
to generate ERR of 9%. These results are shown below.

6.17     The risks for the proposed project are minimal.  The only vari-
ables of significance are the output prices and the with project yields.
Historically, output prices of crops under the project have not shown 40%
fall in real terms. Similarly the chances for with project yields to drop
by 25% are remote. For example, maize yields would have to stop at the
maximum of 4 tons per ha. There are evidences to suggest in Romania that
average maize yields on presently irrigated lands have surpassed 8 tons per
ha. It is also interesting to note that even if the phasing of land
development takes 8 years instead of 4, the project would still be eco-
nomically viable. In an unlikely event of four years delay of construc-
tion, of the storage dams, the proposed project would have an economic rate
of return of 13% which is acceptable. The probabilities for any of the
above circumstances are very small in view of the results attained i~n
ongoing irrigation schemes.  The technical package recommended for crop
cultivation is widely known in Romania and have been adopted successfully.
Neither cost overrun nor implementation delay have been experienced in Bank
assisted irrigation projects.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01     Assurances were obtained from Government of Romania that:
(a)  Government would make suitable arrangements in providing adequate
fertilizer and equipment for application of biocides and
fertilizer in the project area (para. 3.14 and 3.15);
(b)  Government would supply the cultivators in the project area with
agricultural, technical and advisory services, seeds, agricultural
credit, marketing facilities and other agricultural inputs all as
required to make optimal productive use of such area (para. 3.26).
(c) Draganesti dam on the Olt river currently under construction by
the Ministry of Power would be completed by December 31, 1984 to
permit timely irrigation of Caracal subproject (para. 4.06);
(d) Golesti and Riusor dams on the Arges river under construction by
the National Water Council would be completed by December 31, 1983
and December 31, 1984 respectively to permit timely irrigation of
Titu subproject (para. 4.07);
(e) Government would make suitable arrangements for review of design,
construction and operation of those dams on the Olt and Arges
rivers through independent qualified experts acceptable to the
Bank (paras. 4.06 and 4.07);
(f)  a letter of representation assuring the Bank that withdrawals from
the Olt river would not cause problems with other riparian states
(para. 4.09);



- 48 -
(g) procurement of equipment and materials listed in Annex 6, esti-
mated to cost US$80 million would be arranged following inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines (para. 4.16);
(h) a report on project accounts and annual financial statements of

Project Description
A. Caracal
1.       Draganesti Dam on the River Olt.  Development ot the water
resources of the Olt basin has been plannea by a series ot dams. The
Draganesti is one of these dams, currently under construction at 59 kms
trom the Danube. The design ot the dam (13.5 metres high) meets the
standard design criteria. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that the design of this dam shall be examined by an incependent agency. who
shall also inspect the dam during construction to assure proper control on
specifications as well as monitor the dam satety after completion. The
spillway and dykes are safe for 1 in 1,000 year tlood. The dyke section is
concrete facea gravel fill with concrete cut-ott extending to rock. The
spillway and power house are conventional structures, founded on rock. The
caracal subproject woula depend on its water supply trom the Draganesti
storage; the reservoir providing the head to supply water to the system
intakes and the storea water meeting the irrigation shortages in the years
of low Olt flow. The cost of this dam, allocated tor irrigation, will
theretore be considered in the economic analysis ot the project. The dam
is scheduled for completion in 1984 and assurances were sought during
negotiations that timely completion will be achieved.
2.        Intakes for Irrigation System.  The main intake ot the conduit
type (4 of 2.4 m x 2.5 m), would be located in the right cyke ot the
Draganesti dam at 5 km upstream of the dam. It has been designed to pass a
discharge ot 48.5 m3/sec in the main canal CAL, with the reservoir at the
lowest level of 77 m.   To save on pumping costs, the intake would allow
the canal water level to rise, tor higher reservoir elevations; the level
not exceeding 82.5 m, which is the dominant level for the reservoir, the
maximum being 84.5 m. This intake shall teed the system for 82,000 ha.
The intake for the system for the remaining 6,000 ha would be an outlet in
the Draganesti dam, designed to pass 3.5 m /sec, and controlled by 1,200
mm diameter butterfly valves. The cost ot the outlet is not chargea to
Caracal project, and forms a part of the Draganesti dam cost debitable to
irrigation.

Page 2
3.       System of Open Canals and Pump Stations.  The CAL, 6,900 m long,
would carry the supplies from the intake to the pumping station, at the toe
of the terrace. It would have high banks to allow water level variation
from 76.5 m to 82.5 m. Direct irrigation from the canal would be 4,200 ha
in the plains. The pumping station SPAI would raise the supply from 76.5 m
to 97 m into two canals CDI (6 m3/sec) and CAT (41 m3/sec). CDI,
18,385 m long, with the repumping stations SRP4, SRP5 and SRP6 would cover
the area (about 7,400 ha) between the Oltet and Teslui rivers, extending to
elevation 142 m. CAT would skirt around the terrace at elevation 97 m for
6,785 metres, where 40 m3/sec would be pumped up to elevation 133.5 m.
The canal would then follow the contour for 11,870 meters and would feed
the canals CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD6, CD7 and CD8, covering an area of 44,800
ha. Water of canal CD2 would be pumped up to 144.7 m by SRP2 for an area
of 12,100 ha and CD4 supplies would be raised to 154.2 m by SRP3 for an
area of 13,500 ha. The canal CD9 would get its supplies from the dam
intake. The total length of all the open canals would be 128 km. All the
canals would be concrete lined, and both cast in situ and precast slabs
would be used. The canal longitudinal slopes would vary from 0.08 to 0.12
per thousand. Operation of the canals would be automated by constant down-
stream level type regulating structures, and the canals would be used for
storage to balance the continuous pumping with 20 or 22 hour irrigation.
About 100 structures would be provided on the canal system. These would
include escape weirs at suitable locations to control the occasional flow
in excess of canal storage.
4.       Pressure Pumping Stations and Irrigation Equipment.  Forty-one
pressure pumping stations would pump the canal supplies into buried pipe
network for feeding the sprinkler and furrow irrigation equipment. The
network shall cover the currently irrigated areas also, since no network
exists in these areas and irrigation is practised through surface pipes or
ditches. Diesel pumps, currently in use in these areas, are in poor shape
and shall not be usable. Main and secondary pipes would be in presetressed
concrete. The A.C. or PVC distribution pipes would be spaced 800 m apart
and would be 1,260 to 2,000 m long. Hydrants would be located on the
distribution pipes at 72 m spacing. The sprinkler irrigation would be done
for 22 hours per day in an area of 74,000 ha, where ground water level is
below 2m. Three types of sprinklers would be used: manually shifted for
65% area, longitudinally drawn for 26%, and self-moving for 9%. The
sprinklers would be spaced on the laterals at 18m to supply water to an
area of 18 m x 24 m. Furrow irrigation would be done for 20 hours per day,
in 14,000 ha, where ground water is 5 to 10 m deep and ground slopes are 3
to 10%. The furrow lengths would be about 200 m and distance between
furrows 0.8 m. The furrow equipment would be of aluminium and flexible
butyl rubber of 150 mm diameter supplying water to 16 to 20 furrows from
one hydrant.
5.       On one distribution pipe 3 to 5 sprinkler installations or 2 to 3
furrow equipment would usually operate. For small areas, irrigation would
be done by the use of monofilar pumps. The entire system would have 1,673



- 53 -                               ANNEX 2
Page 3
km of pipe network, 48 pressure pumping stations having vertical pumping
units, 130 monofilar asynchronous pumps, 972 longitudinally drawn
sprinklers, 280 self-moving, 2,519 manually moved and 434 furrow equip-
ment. In addition, sprinklers currently in use in the irrigated areas,
shall continue being used.
6.       Surface Drainage Network.  The surface drainage network is
designed for 0.75 1/s/ha which corresponds to run-off from 5% probability
rainfall, but the works on the drainage channels are designed for 1.12
1/s/ha which corresponds to 1% probability of rain. The drains would be
spaced at 400 m and 600 m depending on topography. These would out[all
into natural drainage channels, which would be improved to carry the flow
up to the Olt. Drainage system would be new in 29,100 ha, where eight
separate systems would drain from 1,500 to 5,900 ha. Total length of these
drainage channels would be about 500 kms. The existing drainage channels,
about 250 kms. in length in 9,400 ha, would be improved in section.
7.       Tile Drainage.  Tile drainage would be provided in 8,000 ha to
lower the ground water level. Ceramic tiles 700 mm diameter laid in gravel
envelope at about 1.5 m depth and slope 1.5 to 2 per thousand, would form
the suction drains at a spacing of 20-40 m and 150-200 m long; the
collector drains would be 100-200 mm diameter. The collector drains would
have inspection chambers every 100 m. The system is designed for 0.6
1/s/ha, which will prevent ground water rising above 1.2 m.
8.       Soil Erosion Control Works.  Soil erosion controls works would be
carried out in 1,730 ha, concentrated between the Teslui and Oltet rivers.
The works would mainly comprise making terraces, intercepting channels at
toe of slopes and check dams in gulleys besides pasture fertilization and
grass covered outlets.
9.       Flood Detention Dams and Valley Training.  Four flood detention
dams are proposed one each in Rotunda and Polovincle valleys and two in
Crusov valley. These dams would be earth structures with toe filters.
Similar 12 dams are already existing in other valleys within the project
area and have performed well. The four proposed dams would also be
utilized for fish culture and the outlets from the dams would have control
valves to maintain a minimum pool. The upstream face of the dam would have
concrete facing up to the fish pool level. The capacity of the dams is
fixed for no overflow for a flood of probability 1% and freeboard of
minimum 50 cms on a flood of probability 0.3%. The routed flow from any of
these dams is less than 10.5 m3/sec for 1% probability and less than 23
M3/sec for 0.3% probability.
10.      The Polovincle joins the Rotunda at a short distance below the
dam. The Rotunda and the Crusov flow down to the Olt. The valleys between
the flood detention dams and the Olt would be trained for carrying the flow
of 1% probability within the banks. En route these valleys are crossed by



- 54 -                               ANNEX 2
Page 4
a railway line, a national highway and the main irrigation canal for
Stoenesti-Visina system. These crossings would be reconstructed to pass
the discharges corresponding to 0.3% probability.
11.      Reclaiming Sandy Areas.  About 4,000 ha of the project area has
sand dunes. This is an extension of the sandy stretches in the Sadova-
Corabia irrigation project, where about 37,000 ha have been successfully
reclaimed. Similar measures involving levelling of sand dunes and
protection by shelter belts would be adopted for these 4,000 ha also.
B. Titu
12.      Golesti and Riusor Dam.  Two dams-Golesti and Riusor are now under
construction, providing 102 million m3 storage capacity, to augment the
water supply for industry and drinking water as well as provide additional
irrigation. The Titu Project is dependent on the releases from Golesti and
Riusor to meet the irrigation requirements. The cost of these two dams,
attributable to irrigation, shall therefore be considered in the economic
costs of Titu sub-project. The Golesti dam is 21.75 m high. The concrete
spillway structure and power station are founded on rock. The dykes 7.6 km
long have concrete faced gravel section, with cut-off to rock. The Riusor
is a 101.5 m high concrete dam. Both the dams have been designed to meet
the universally accepted design criteria. Assurances shall, however, be
obtained during negotiations that the design of these dams shall be exam-
ined by independent experts who shall also inspect the dam during construc-
tion to assure proper control on specifications as well as monitor the dam
safety after completion. Golesti dam is scheduled for completion in 1983
and Riusor in 1984. Assurances shall be obtained during negotiations that
the timely construction of these dams will be achieved.
13.      Diversion Structure on the Arges.  A concrete diversion structure
124 m long, having dykes on both sides about 4 km long, would divert the
river supplies to the left canal intake, where an ejector would remove the
sediment. The sediment free water would be fed into the left bank and
right bank canals. The water for the latter would pass through the ducts
in the diversion structure floor. The diversion structure has been
designed for 1% probability flood (1,150 m3/sec) for energy dissipation and
for 0.1% probability flood (3,170 m3/sec) for clearances and safety of
dykes.
14.      Left Bank Canal System.  The left bank canal system would cover
29,020 ha. Its main canal, discharge 13.10 m3/sec, would run close to
the northern boundary with length 45.15 kms. At 4.8 km of this canal, an
offtake, discharge 4.60 m3/sec, would feed the Sabar stream, which would
be improved in a length of 52.05 kms, to serve as a branch canal irrigating
10,590 ha. The Sabar flow from the upper catchment is being intercepted by

a cross cut, diverting the flood water of the tributaries of Dimbovita to
the Arges for protection of Bucharest town from Dimbovita floods. Only
limited drainage from adjacent areas would thus be reaching Sabar, which
will have the dual function of a canal and a drain. Assurances would be
obtained that these flood diversion channels (cross cuts) would be com-
pleted by December 31, 1982.
15.      Right Bank Canal System.  The right bank canal system would irri-
gate 13,657 ha. The main canal, without branch canals, would run along the
middle of the area for 38.35 kms. The canal would run for nearly half of
its length close to the Pitesti-Bucharest National Highway.
16.      Pressure Pumping Stations and Irrigation System.  Twenty-nine
pressure pumping stations having vertical pumps would pump water from the
canals into buried pipe network for sprinkler and furrow irrigation. For
small areas, asynchronous monofilar pumps would be used. The network would
cover currently irrigated areas. All these areas have no permanent irriga-
tion system and surface pipes and ditches are used. The introduction of
the network shall assure supplies in these areas and the use of old diesel
pumps shall be discontinued. The network would provide hydrants at 72 m
spacing, antennae spacing being 800 m. The furrows would be 50 to 200 m
long, spaced 70 cms, and would be fed by 150 mm diameter aluminium equip-
ment. The furrow irrigation would be done 22 hours per day. The sprinkler
pattern would be 18 m x 24 m and three types of sprinkler equipment would
be used - hand moved, longitudinally drawn, and self moving. Furrow
irrigation shall be practised in 15,404 ha and sprinkler irrigation in
26,083 ha. The area under furrow irrigation in one year would be sprinkler
irrigated the next year. The current irrigation is mostly furrow. The
sprinklers, wherever used shall continue to be utilized.
17.      Open Surface Drains.  Surface drains would be constructed in
34,747 ha to carry away rain excess. The layout is based on 5% proba-
bility rainfall in 72 hour period, the hydro-modulus being 0.83 1/s/ha.
Drains, spaced from 300 m to 500 m, outfall into the nearest natural dain
or irrigation canal, the latter performing a dual function.
18.      Tile Drains.  Ceramic tiles 70 mm dia., with gravel envelope and
150-200 metres long, would be placed at a spacing of 35 m and minimum 1.40
m deep to provide suction drainage in an area of 3,300 ha, which has high
water level. The collector drains would be 150 to 200 mm diameter. The
drainage system is designed for a discharge of 0.60 1/s/ha.
