1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       Country and sector background: Since the early 1990s, successive governments have
tried to reform Pakistan‟s tax system. Despite these attempts, the tax/GDP ratio has remained low
(10 to 13 per cent)1. This relatively low ratio in Pakistan is primarily due to inherent weaknesses
in the tax system including: (i) inefficient tax administration (poor management, weak human
resources, lack of adequate supporting systems, excessive scope for discretion and rent seeking
behavior); (ii) a narrow tax base (of 39.4 million employed persons, only 3.9 percent pay tax);
(iii) skewed tax structure (68% of tax revenue is from indirect taxes); (iv) a complex and non-
transparent tax system; and, (v) corruption and tax evasion (low compensation of tax officials,
informal structure of the economy).

2.       Government Strategy: Recognizing the critical need to increase tax revenue as
paramount for fiscal stability, the Government of Pakistan (GoP) adopted a two-pronged strategy:
tax policy change, to make the tax system more responsive to growth and easier to administer;
and, tax administration improvements to enhance collection efficiency. Based on the
recommendations of a Task Force2, supported by the Bank, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR)3
developed a broad strategy for reforms focusing on: (i) restructuring of FBR along functional
lines and integration of income, sales and excise taxes; (ii) reengineering and automating business
processes and workflows; (iii) establishing databases for reporting and audit purposes; (iv)
introducing a self assessment system for filing tax returns; (v) improving services for taxpayers;
and, (vi) strengthening the human resource base. GoP also intended to improve its fiscal position
by enhancing the tax/GDP ratio from its stagnant level. Further, GoP made several tax policy
reforms, which included change in the organizational structure of FBR, abolition of wealth tax,
introduction of two-tier Agriculture Income Tax in all provinces, reduction in multiplicity of
taxes at both federal and provincial levels, broadening the base of General Sales Tax (GST),
lowering of income tax rate, and gradual withdrawal of Central Excise Duties.

3.      Rationale for Bank assistance: Against this backdrop, and following a number of earlier
interventions4, the Bank provided a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) of US$2.9 million in 2002
to support implementation of GoP‟s tax reform initiatives and to prepare a comprehensive

  The band of 10% -13% for Pakistan covers the period 1993-2003. As per OECD, the tax/GDP ratio ranges between
30 to 50 per cent for developed countries, with an average of 38%, while for developing countries it is about 18%
(PAD, page 5). However, an upward adjustment by GoP authorities to the GDP series data starting in 2000/01 affects
tax/GDP data comparisons included in the PAD for the periods before 2000/01 and after 2010/11. As a result of the
recalculation of the GDP series, the tax/GDP was adjusted downwards by about 3% of GDP in the year 2000/01.

 Until July 2007, the revenue agency was called the Central Board of Revenue (CBR). It then became the Federal
Board of Revenue (FBR), which designation will be used throughout the ICR.

strategy with implementation timelines and costs for the medium/long term reform program5. The
PPF was intended to support the testing of pilot schemes including, inter alia, the setting up of
Large Taxpayer Unit (LTU), Medium Taxpayer Unit (MTU), sales tax refund program, and
human resource information management system. In 2004, the Bank assisted FBR in the
preparation of the Tax Administration Reform Project (TARP) to achieve significant progress in
the GoP‟s reform program,6 on a phased basis. TARP was prepared to: (i) restructure FBR along
functional lines and have an integrated tax administration over the long term; (ii) strengthen FBR
through organizational and management reforms, and provide it with necessary autonomy; (iii)
improve the level of existing human resource capacity through streamlined training; (iv) re-
engineer its operational processes and systems, and introduce modern and automated risk based
tax systems that would reduce contact between taxpayers and tax officials, foster voluntary
compliance, and strengthen the institutional framework for tax enforcement; and, (v) improve
FBR‟s physical infrastructure.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

4.      The PDOs 7 of the project were to: (i) improve the effectiveness, responsiveness,
efficiency, integrity and fairness of tax administration; (ii) promote compliance with tax laws and
broaden the tax base; and (iii) promote trade facilitation.

5.          Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): These were:

           Macro indicators: (a) total tax revenues collected by tax/GDP ratio; (b) tax revenues
            collected by sector/GDP; and, (c) average time taken by new businesses to register with
            tax authorities.

           Organizational efficiency and effectiveness: amount of taxes collected/number of tax
            administration staff.

           Compliance management: (a) number of registered active taxpayers; (b) tax revenues
            paid on time/total revenues assessed; (c) ratio of additional taxes collected after tax
            audit/number of tax audits conducted; and, (d) stakeholder opinion on quality of services
            provided (collected through a structured survey conducted by an independent firm and
            through report cards introduced).

           Trade facilitation: (a) reduction of the average customs clearance time to less than one
            day by the end of 2006, and (b) to under four hours by the end of the project at designated
            sites.




5
    This PPF followed a series of PRSCs / DPLs that were also aimed at tax reform.

6
  The reform program was further supported by: (i) Technical Assistance which included support to FBR and MoF on
GST policy reform and support to TARP implementation starting in 2008; (ii) Analytical Work, for a comprehensive
study on Pakistan‟s tax system, launched in January 2007 and concluded in July 2009; and, (iii) subsequent
development policy credits supporting key policy and administrative reforms until 2010.

7
    According to Project‟s Development Credit Agreement (DCA), dated March 9, 2005.




                                                            2
           Integrity and fairness: (a) public perception of revenue administration integrity as
            measured by periodic surveys; (b) staff perception of integrity as measured by periodic
            surveys; and, (c) average number of days to complete administrative appeals process.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

6.      In August 2010, the project was restructured 8 and the PDOs were reformulated and
streamlined. The PDO became: To improve the effectiveness of Pakistan‟s revenue
administration. The reformulated outcome indicators were:

           FBR gross and net revenue collection as a percentage of tax revenue target (total for each
            tax) (monthly, quarterly, annual): increase;
           FBR total tax collection/GDP (annual): increase;
           Survey based ratings for the FBR: improved perception by stakeholders;
           Stop-filers as percentage of registered active taxpayers (total, type of tax, and taxpayer
            size): decreased percentage;
           Additional tax paid after audit as percentage of total collection of domestic taxes:
            increase; and
           Modernized FBR organization structure fully functional.

7.      The 2010 project restructuring was intended to: (i) respond to GoP‟s renewed
commitment to key revenue administration and policy reforms and more effective project
implementation in the wake of Pakistan‟s macroeconomics challenges9; and (ii) produce a more
focused project, with a clearer, results-oriented development objective and relevant results
indicators in line with FBR‟s adopted 2008 Action Plan, based on Bank recommendations. The
indicators were similar to the original ones but consolidated to address outstanding organizational
and implementation issues, including updated revenue targets, stakeholder perceptions (survey),
and several efficiency and effectiveness measures.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

8.       The intended beneficiaries under the original and restructured project were: (i) taxpayers
at the household and corporate levels in Pakistan, through simplified tax regulations and reporting
requirements allowing, among other objectives, a smoother transition from the informal to formal
economic sectors; and, (ii) FBR‟s departments and collectorates10.

1.5 Original Components

9.      The TARP comprised seven components: (i) Management and Institutional
Development; (ii) Improving Revenue Operations; (iii) Strengthening Revenue Services; (iv)
Creating a Tax Compliant Culture; (v) Adopting Responsive IT Systems; (vi) Infrastructure Up-
gradation and Development; and, (vii) Project Management and Implementation.


8
    The restructuring was approved by the Bank‟s Executive Directors on September 1, 2010.

9
  This relates to concerns about high current account deficit, the employment downturn, substantial external financing
requirements and insufficient counterpart financing due to limited fiscal space.

10
     The FBR Customs field offices are known as Collectorates.




                                                           3
1.6 Revised Components

10.     After restructuring, the original components were reorganized into four components for
simplification and more effective implementation and monitoring as follows: A. Enforcement
(including audit); B. Organization and Management for increased efficiency; C. Information
Technology; and D. Project Management and Implementation. (Annex 2D shows the linkage
between the original and the revised components, and Annex 2E shows the activities planned
under various components).

1.7 Other significant changes

11.      The 2010 restructured TARP emphasized: (i) actions to strengthen enforcement and
resume audits; (ii) changes in FBR‟s organization and management to increase efficiency
(functional organization); (iii) responsive IT systems; and, (iv) project and program management
activities. None of the changes altered the original economic, financial, technical, institutional or
social aspects of the project as originally appraised. The financial management and disbursement
arrangements remained the same.

12.     Other significant changes included: (i) Realignment of project activities to conform to the
FBR Action Plan (including internal adjustments in activities), with revised project costs and an
updated Procurement Plan; (ii) Reduction of the overall IBRD loan amount to reflect changes in
the FBR‟s IT and automation strategy (basically handled internally by FBR without loan
resources), and reallocation of loan, credit and grant funds to finance the revised project activities
and costs; (iii) Classification of the project as environmental category “B?, to fully conform to
OP/BP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), and inclusion of measures to ensure safeguard
compliance; (iv) 100 percent financing of eligible expenditures from IDA Credit and the DFID
Grant11; (v) a single disbursement category to simplify disbursements under previous expenditure
categories within the overall amounts available under both the IDA Credit and the DFID Grant, to
avoid further amendments in the legal agreement; and (vi) extension of the Closing Date of
TARP to December 31, 2011.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

13.      Lessons from earlier operations: Lessons learned from Bank-supported tax
administration reforms in LAC, EAP, ECA Regions, and previous efforts to improve tax
administration in Pakistan were incorporated into the original project, including: high level
political support and ownership of program; presence of “champions of change? within the tax
department; special attention to taxpayer facilitation; reduction in the discretionary powers of tax
officials; simplification of procedures for filing and processing of tax returns; and establishment
of a consultative process.




11
  This was in recognition of the constraints posed by the prevailing fiscal challenges in Pakistan and the paucity of
counterpart funds.




                                                         4
14.      Project design: Original project design features that positively impacted project
implementation and outcomes include: (i) adequate resource allocation for FBR‟s physical
infrastructure upgrading and IT deployment required to support the implementation of the tax
administration reform agenda, and (ii) significant emphasis on the development of taxpayer
services for FBR to reduce taxpayer compliance costs, including the deployment of facilitation
centers. On the other hand, project implementation and outcomes were negatively impacted by
factors related to project design, including: (a) over-optimistic assumptions about the
implementation of legislative changes required to reform tax legislation and implement a
functionally integrated FBR12, and (b) underestimation of internal resistance to FBR‟s integration
initiatives by staff of the Customs and Excise Group (CEG) and the Income Tax Group (ITG).

15.     Quality at entry: Initial project implementation was negatively affected by lack of
preparedness on key strategic choices on information technology (IT) strategy, fiduciary
arrangements, and inadequate Bank technical support:

        Policy uncertainty on an IT modernization strategy. The decision to outsource
         customs automation as a public-private partnership activity instead of the investment
         planned under the project, took some US$28 million of intended disbursements out of the
         project. In addition, FBR management and its internal IT group could not agree on
         whether an off-the-shelf integrated solution vs. in-house development of an Integrated
         Tax Management System (ITMS) would be the right option. In general, prolonged
         disagreements in the development of IT software and infrastructure led to a delay of more
         than two years in implementing the procurement plan. 13

        Lack of policy dialogue on key policy and legislative reform measures needed to
         achieve project’s development objectives. Excessive focus on the minutiae of project
         implementation in the initial years resulted in the Bank‟s team inattention to the
         importance of having regular high-level policy dialogue with GoP/FBR and providing
         TA to FBR to support tax administration reform efforts.

        Lack of Bank technical assistance to support initial stages of project
         implementation. The depth and comprehensiveness of the proposed reform of tax and
         customs administration, combined with uneven technical and absorption capacity at FBR,
         required strong TA guidance at the outset to develop an action plan with breakdown of
         actions and tasks. The PPF inputs and pilot results were not followed, leading to
         disconnected inputs and products and little or no institutionalization of assistance
         rendered in many key functionalities.

        Initial misclassification of project’s environment category. Despite a large civil works
         component aimed at the refurbishment of several existing FBR buildings and facilities14,


12
  For the integration of FBR into a full, function-based organization to be successful and sustainable, due diligence
work was required at the outset to test the extent of reforms needed in key pieces of legislation and FBR‟s internal
rulings, and its likelihood of success.

13
   IT strategy at entry was not implemented as planned, which left an undisbursed balance of nearly $51 million at the
originally scheduled closing of the project (December 31, 2009). The procurement processes involved (single and two
stage bidding) also proved to be a disruptive element at this stage.

14
  According to the project‟s PAD, the infrastructure up-grading component was estimated at US$24 million, which
represented about 17 percent of total project cost.



                                                          5
         and the construction of some new facilities, the project was classified as “C?, instead of
         “B?, leading to insufficient attention to full compliance with Bank OP/BP 4.01 on
         environmental assessment.

16.      Identification of risk factors and mitigation measures: The project was implemented
within a more volatile and risky environment than originally estimated, due to a combination of
factors, such as: adverse economic circumstances, a challenging political environment with
frequent changes of political authorities and FBR staff at the senior levels, turnover on Bank
supervision teams, strong internal resistance to change, adverse country security issues, and
unstable infrastructure needs, such as power supply.

17.     Most risk factors were adequately identified in the original project design, except for the
following:

        Lack of implementation of critical tax policy reforms. The achievement of
         development objectives targeted at the outset in terms of revenue mobilization15required
         substantial and parallel efforts in both tax policy and tax administration. Mutually
         supportive reforms in both are not only a desirable strategy aligned with best practice in
         tax reforms worldwide, but in the particular case of Pakistan, represented a key element
         for success. Reform of FBR alone was insufficient to bring in expected collection targets
         operating within a narrow based, non-transparent, and complex tax legislation. 16 In
         particular, the lack of approval of a broad-based VAT legislation, or reformed GST,
         proved a major constraint for the project to achieve PDOs.

        Needed reforms on legal framework. Structural changes to FBR, as originally
         envisioned in the PAD, entailed the need to anticipate legal constraints embedded in
         different pieces of legislation and ordinances with the potential to reduce the scope of
         project implementation in key areas. This was particularly critical for the integration of
         revenue administration structure to operate under functional lines, and for the
         harmonization of tax procedural rules required to administer different taxes under a
         common institutional platform.17 The legal constraints imposed in the Tax Acts limited
         FBR‟s ability to reorganize and to take computerized actions or reallocate functions to
         different staff, as this could only be done through appropriate amendments in the
         legislation.

        A highly volatile political and security environment. The project was implemented
         within an unstable and contentious political period, characterized by significant public
         activism, changes in government, and increasing insecurity in the country. These
         unpredictable circumstances had severe consequences for project implementation,


15
  Original project design estimated a buoyancy coefficient (ratio of percent change of tax revenue to GDP or other
underlining tax base) of 1.2, signaling an increase of 0.20 percent of tax-GDP ratio for each one percent increase of
GDP.

16
  A complete description of the tax policy role on the reform of the tax system in Pakistan is described in “Tax Policy
Report, Tapping Tax Bases for Development?, Report no. 50078-PK, World Bank, 2009.

17
  For example, tax legislation in Pakistan empowers only specific FBR authorities (e.g. commissioners) to carry out
key operational procedures (e.g. some refunds or enforcement actions), limiting the scope of the reform to reorganize
and reallocate functions across the organization following cost-effective criteria.




                                                          6
          including recruitment of international consultants and travel to Pakistan by Bank
          missions.

18.      Among the identified risk factors with insufficient identification of mitigation
measures, stiff resistance from vested interests against restructuring of FBR resulted in
slow progress on the functional integration of income, sales, and excise taxes. Despite being
recognized as a major risk factor at the outset, executive and staff resistance to restructuring
proved to be a major disruptive element throughout implementation. A change management
workshop promoted by FBR authorities during project preparation was foreseen as a mitigation
measure at entry point, while similar events were advised in future stages of reform
implementation18. However, the depth of the organizational reform embraced by the project, even
if implemented gradually as advocated by the Bank, entailed a fundamental and complex change
with highly unsettling potential consequences for an organization facing internal struggles to
reform. The litigation and the Inspection Panel review, initiated by groups of FBR staff
associations, have highlighted that additional mitigation measures should have been proposed at
the outset to ensure a gradual but effective management of organizational change, while
providing safeguards for an equitable and fair treatment of all staff along the reorganization
process.

2.2 Implementation

19.       Implementation was affected by the following factors:

      Positive Factors in Project Implementation

         The Federal Board of Revenue Act, 2007 was approved by the Parliament, replacing the
          Central Board of Revenue with the new Federal Board of Revenue, in line with the tax
          administration reforms that had been agreed between GoP and the Bank, and set the stage
          for functional integration at FBR.

         The over four years‟ tenure of the first Chairman, FBR under TARP (March 12, 2004 to
          July 23, 2008) reflected GoP‟s strong commitment to tax administration reform and
          provided the continuity that had been envisaged at appraisal.

         Project restructuring, extension of the closing date, and the appointment of a committed
          PMU Chief/Project Director, helped the project to complete many critical activities
          related to physical and IT-related infrastructure.

      Factors that Negatively Affected Project Implementation

         Overall lack of reform ownership by FBR rank and file officers, frequent changes of FBR
          leadership after 2008, and delays in formation of the PMU and readying procurement


18
  Also, original project design embraced a “co-location? strategy towards FBR integration along functional lines from
tax-by-type bases. According to this strategy, location of sales and income tax staff in the same physical space, without
changing lines of authority, was expected to ease transition towards a new structure. Without additional measures to
accelerate the restructuring process, the strategy increased entrenchment to maintain the traditional modus operandi
across field formations.




                                                           7
            packages before loan approval, undermined continuity of project management, weakened
            implementation monitoring, slowed procurement, and hindered financial management
            and disbursements.

           Inability of GoP to secure Parliamentary approval for the broad-based GST legislation -
            originally envisioned to be introduced by July 2010, but indefinitely postponed thereafter,
            limited the project‟s scope to achieve PDOs.

           Inspection Panel review, requested in January 2010 by officers of the Customs and
            Excise Association, slowed reform momentum, underlined divisions among staff from
            different service groups, delayed the restructuring process 19 , led to departures of key
            personnel from the PMU, and as a result further delayed processing of major IT
            procurement packages20.

           Unfavorable economic circumstances on account of a deteriorating security situation, and
            the massive floods in 2010 and 2011, further eroded tax bases and compliance levels.

           Slow responsiveness of World Bank supervision teams before project restructuring to
            resolving implementation bottlenecks, and insufficient pro-activity to suggest timely
            corrective actions, which was partly affected by changes in TTLs.

           Weak monitoring and evaluation arrangements (see 2.3 below).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

20.     FBR‟s PMU was initially responsible for establishing the M&E sub-component of TARP
to monitor the original key performance indicators (KPIs). The project management team
prepared a baseline scenario with qualitative and quantitative performance indicators. Following
the approval of the project restructuring, TARP‟s performance was assessed against the revised
KPIs. Especially since September 2008, FBR regularly provided data against the KPIs to Bank
implementation review and TA missions. 21 However, FBR did not set up a specific
M&E/Coordination unit with oversight at a Member level, to adequately monitor progress
of, and follow up on, the reform action plan, detect deviations and propose short-term
responsive actions. This shortcoming had been consistently flagged in the Bank‟s supervision
documents since 2009 as a major constraint to project implementation and follow up of actions
agreed during supervision missions. The creation of an M&E/Coordination unit for TARP, with
supervision at a Member level, remained an unfulfilled commitment by FBR management until
the project‟s closing date.




19
     Source: Restructuring Paper – August 19, 2010.

20
  The Bank initially agreed on only a 3-month extension (up to March 31, 2010). The PMU was unable to start major
procurement processes in light of prevailing uncertainty.

21
  Data on TARP performance was provided by various units of FBR to the Member for Strategic Planning and
Statistics (SP&S), who was also the Project Director for TARP for most of 2009–2011. The office of Member, SP&S,
served as the focal point for Bank supervision missions.




                                                       8
2.4 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

21.      Safeguards: At the restructuring, the project‟s environmental category was changed from
“C? to “B? and OP/BP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment) was triggered owing to the construction
of some housing facilities for FBR staff in different cities in Pakistan, financed by TARP 22. GoP
prepared an environmental management plan (EMP) with adequate institutional arrangements to
address possible low-level, temporary environmental impacts. The EMP compliance varied
between different work sites, and is rated as moderately satisfactory. One weak area was
irregular preparation of the quarterly progress report - only three such reports for EMP
compliance were prepared for six quarters. One of the construction sites had some moderate level
of environmental sensitivity related to the need to avoid the cutting of several mature trees in a
hilly terrain, which the project complied with.

22.      Financial Management: The PMU was responsible for financial management (FM)
aspects of TARP. The project had a disbursement flag (2008 and 2009) on account of long delays
in implementation of large IT packages.23 On account of delays in the hiring of FM specialists
and the departure of the finance advisor from the PMU, the FM ratings in the ISRs were less than
satisfactory until late 2009. During this period, the external auditors also highlighted a number of
observations on poor FM practices. From 2010 onwards, a dedicated and strengthened team in the
PMU was able to turn the performance around, address the pending audit queries, significantly
increase the disbursement rate, and obtained a satisfactory FM rating from the Bank supervision
mission in July 2011.

23.      Procurement: The PMU handled the procurement function as well. As in the case of the
FM function, procurement was slow in the early years on account of PMU‟s weak procurement
capacity and protracted delays in the decisions on the procurement of major IT packages and
finalization of bidding documents (see footnote 19). On account of relatively steady progress on
contracts relating to the procurement of civil works and goods, the procurement rating in ISRs
was maintained at satisfactory until December 2007, when it was changed to moderately
unsatisfactory due to delays in procurement of IT packages. Again, because of new leadership at
the PMU in early 2010 and intensive Bank supervision24, a remarkable turn-around also took
place in PMU‟s procurement-related performance. Between May 201025 and December 31, 2011,
the PMU completed 8 ICBs, 13 NCBs, and 14 QCBS activities among a total of around 50
procurements for a total value of about US$41.6 million.




22
     For future operations, it is important that the safeguards rating should be based on project content.

23
  In 2007, FBR decided to proceed with a national customs computerized system through a public-private partnership
and not utilize US$28 million from TARP. Similarly, in February 2008, FBR decided to go for in-house development
of ITMS through PRAL, using outside experts as needed, under the guidance of the international program manager.
This was to be based on the Information Systems Plan, which was approved by FBR‟s Board and endorsed by the Bank.

24
  Starting from May 2010, the PMU developed an excellent working relationship with the Bank‟s core task team. The
Bank‟s procurement specialist, responsible for TARP, was also moved from New Delhi to Islamabad. These
developments had a very positive impact on project implementation in terms of matters relating to TARP‟s
procurements, FM, disbursements, and safeguards.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

24.      A DLI-based “Revenue Mobilization Project"26 has been proposed by GoP as a follow-up
operation to the TARP and is under preparation with a PPF advance (P128182). The objective is
to consolidate the tax administration reform initiated under the TARP using a performance-based
results framework. Activities are aimed at improving FBR's effectiveness, accountability, and
transparency of tax administration through a results-based approach. The components/activities of
the PPF will include (i) improving revenue forecasting; (ii) consolidating FBR tax administration
functions (including HR, training, and strategic planning) supporting results-based management;
(iii) enhancing the accountability of tax administration (M&E systems); and (iv) strengthening
FBR automation to achieve a modern, performance-based (M&E oriented) tax
administration. Lessons learned from the TARP will be incorporated into the new DLI project. In
view of the fact that responsibility for administration of sales tax on services has been devolved to
the provincial governments, the Sindh and Punjab Provinces have approached the Bank for
technical assistance to set up provincial revenue authorities and support other capacity building
measures for provincial tax administration.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

25.      Low revenue mobilization stands out as one of the long and most pressing
development challenges in Pakistan27. This is the result of a combination of factors, such as
inefficient tax administration, narrow and skewed tax structure, complex and obsolete legislation,
non-transparent tax system, rent-seeking behavior and rampant tax evasion. As a consequence,
the federal tax to GDP ratio has declined to 8.6 percent of GDP in 2010/11 from 9.3 percent of
GDP a decade ago, with a steep drop during the last few years. At current levels, the tax ratio is
not only the lowest in Pakistan for the last 35 years, but also one of the lowest in the world.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

26.     The underlining development objective in terms of FBR tax-GDP ratio was not
achieved, despite progress in key intermediate outputs and substantial investments in IT,
physical and human infrastructure at FBR. Notwithstanding moderate gains during 2004/05 to
2008/09, FBR tax-GDP collection has dropped substantially to reach 8.6 percent of GDP by the
end of FY 2010/11, the lowest level in more than two decades.

27.     During the first half of the 2000s, FBR‟s tax-GDP ratio followed a cyclical pattern within
a narrow range of 9.1 to 9.4 percent of GDP (Graph 1). Despite sustained increases in economic
growth, revenue collection from major taxes remained flat, reflecting low tax effort. In fact, the
tax buoyancy coefficient reached only 0.93 during this period, meaning that revenue collection
increased at a lower rate compared to overall economic growth. However, after project
implementation started in 2005, two different and even opposite patterns in FBR tax-GDP ratio

     DLI stands for Disbursement Linked Indicator.

27
  According to the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Pakistan for the period FY 2010-13, “Weak revenue
mobilization is the key challenge for addressing Pakistan’s tight fiscal constraints? (para 39).

28.      The economic crisis in 2008 prompted GoP to take immediate measures to increase tax
revenues as part of an own-designed stabilization program, which was supported by the IMF
through a Stand-By Arrangement. As a consequence, the reform program gained momentum and
project implementation pace speeded up, allowing substantial investments in FBR‟s physical and
IT infrastructure and renewed efforts on technical assistance to implement FBR‟s action plan. As
a result, FBR maintained progress against some key outcome indicators. Positive results achieved
from FY 2008/09 to FY 2010/11 included: (i) registered and active taxpayers increased by 12%
from 3.345 million to 3.774 million; (ii) electronic return filers increased by 19% and 58% for
sales tax and income tax filers, respectively; (iii) registered and active taxpayers for Income Tax
and Sales Tax (e-enrolled, liable to e-file) increased by 29% and 13%, respectively, and (iv) the
amounts of refunds to taxpayers as well as the efficiency for processing refunds increased
substantially (Rs. 33 bn to Rs. 106 bn) as a result of efforts to clear the backlog of Sales Tax
refunds pending for up to 10 years.

29.     However, positive trends on some key outputs achieved during the final years of
project implementation fell short of overcoming shrinking revenue performance (Graph 2).
FBR‟s lower than expected overall performance by end of the project life cycle is associated with
three major shortcomings:

(a) Slow integration of FBR organization along functional lines, because of resistance from staff
   of the Customs and Excise Group (CEG) and the Income Tax Group (ITG), lack of effective
   monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, and an unstable tenure at mid-management levels
   undermining the efficiency and effectiveness of FBR to implement its reform action plan.

(b) Underutilization of IT-related systems due to poor integration of the new systems into re-
   engineered business processes, weak management follow up on implementation of systems,
   and opposition of FBR staff to adopt new business processes based on newly deployed
   systems at field formations; and

(c) Continued weakness of the audit function, associated with lower than expected performance
   by the audit program delivered by private accounting firms during the outsourcing program,



                                                                                              11
     lack of a centralized-based audit function in charge of planning, programming and monitoring
     of results, poor training, and unfavorable results to FBR on legal disputes from tax tribunals.

30.      Break in the chain of reforms had consequences for the achievement of outcomes
envisioned by the project. Without the reorganization of the FBR along functional lines, the
redefinition of business processes was left in limbo. Without the implementation of new business
processes, related IT investments were insufficiently incorporated into business routines. Without
the new IT systems, training and change management investments were delayed. The shift from
co-location of tax streams to actual functional integration of tax administration – along with the
concomitant changes in business processes, IT systems and HR reforms – did not have consistent
commitment and support from within the FBR. At root of these problems was a lack of
consistent political commitment to the major reorganization of tax administration initially
envisioned in the GoP’s own strategy and supported by TARP (see Section 5.2)

3.3 Efficiency

31.      Productivity results from GST administration suggest an overall lackluster FBR
performance under TARP implementation. Notwithstanding the VAT productivity ratio is
typically used in cross-sectional analysis to assess VAT efficiency, the construction of a time
             Graph 3 GST Productivity Index
                                             series for a given country also serves as a diagnostic
                      (2004/05 = 100)        tool to gauge tax administration performance through
             110
                                             time, when controlled for tax policy changes (see
             105

                                             estimation methodology). During the economic crisis
               90
                                             period and subsequent years (2008-11), the GST
               85                            productivity index declined at a higher rate compared
               80                            to FBR tax-GDP ratio despite a swift turnaround on
               75                            project implementation and concomitant positive

                                             shocks experienced by the Pakistani economy during
this period, with disrupting effects on economic activity - such as the floods during 2010/11 -
further undermined weak compliance levels in Pakistan 28 beyond FBR capabilities to mitigate
their effect. Nevertheless, dismal results in reform implementation described in the preceding
section, especially those related to short-term actions aimed at curbing evasion through more
effective enforcement actions by the final year of project implementation, strongly suggests a
weak FBR performance from 2008 onward, far from the project objectives envisioned at the
outset.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

32.     From a thorough review of outcomes under each component by its closing date, the
project only achieved moderately unsatisfactory (MU) achievements against the PDOs. As


28
  Economic downturns typically expose tax administrations to emerging challenges due to expected decline of tax file
turnaround, increased accumulation of arrears stock, lower payment of withholding taxes, and increase in net operating
losses.




                                                                                            12
discussed in Bank quarterly supervision reports after the restructuring, achievements on
intermediate outcome and output indicators, such as increase in taxpayer registration, reduction in
stop-filing population, and increasing the number of e-tax filers, have not yet resulted in
increased net revenue collection levels in real terms (see Annex 2 and Section 3.3).

33.      Failure to fully achieve project’s development objectives is partially explained by
the lack of comprehensive tax reforms in Pakistan – especially the introduction of a broad
based GST- as well as other powerful external and internal factors negatively affecting FBR
collection targets, such as the economic slowdown due to domestic and external shocks. FBR
management‟s lack of success in delivering decisive change as originally envisioned by TARP
only worsened the outcome (see Section 3.2).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

34.     Exceptionally weak domestic resources mobilization in Pakistan reduce fiscal space
to increase allocation of public expenditure on key social and physical infrastructure required to
meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), promote growth, and curb poverty levels.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

35.      Despite falling short in fully achieving envisioned PDOs, TARP was instrumental in
establishing needed building blocks in terms of human, physical, and IT investment with the
potential to strengthen institutional capacity at FBR in the mid and long term. Mostly during
the second half of TARP, IDA and DFID financing facilitated massive improvements in FBR‟s
physical29 and IT-related infrastructure30 enabling the improvement of taxpayer services through
refurbished facilities and the successful implementation of e-based services 31 . Also, FBR top
management approved a new HRM policy framework in 2010, including guidelines for new job
classifications, position descriptions, available training programs, compensation packages, and
staff performance evaluation. Detailed job descriptions for positions at field formations reflecting
the integrated structures of RTOs/LTUs have been prepared, and new guidelines were approved
for mobility, postings, transfers, and career path. Finally, an intensive staff training program was
supported by TARP during its final implementation leg, enabling a substantial investment in
management and technical skills to a critical mass of FBR officers both at Headquarters (HQs)
and field formations.




29
   Major refurbishments and development of: 21 Taxpayer Facilitation Centers (TFCs), 13 RTOs, 13 transit
accommodations, 9 Model Customs Collectorates (MCCs), and one LTU were completed.
30
   Construction and configuration of two state-of-the-art data centers, installation of a video conferencing system
linking FBR HQ and 28 other locations, procurement of licensed software, and investment in a critical mass of
hardware equipment across field formations, were completed.
31
  FBR‟s website and e-portal currently allows for 100 percent e-filing and a substantial interaction between taxpayers
and Facilitation and Tax payer Education (FATE) Wing.




                                                         13
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

36.      The process undertaken by FBR management to establish a new occupational group
– the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) - resulted in bitter legal disputes by groups of staff who
perceived that their career development had been adversely affected by the reform. The
GoP took a series of administrative measures during 2009 to reorganize FBR along functional
lines for the achievement of its reform objectives (see Section 3) by merging the administration of
sales, income and excise taxes at LTUs/RTOs and integrating functions for collection,
enforcement, audit and legal. FBR was, therefore, reorganized through the establishment of the
IRS, allowing officers from the previously separated occupational groups – the Customs and
Excise Group and the Income Tax Group - the option to transfer to the new service or remain in
their existing groups.

37.      Following allegations related to both substance and formal procedures, 32 groups of
officers from the Customs and Excise Group Association opposed the reform through different
domestic and international legal instruments, triggering among others a review by Pakistan‟s
High Court and a request for investigation to the Bank‟s Inspection Panel, alleging undue
pressure on the GoP by the Bank to undertake the career service reorganization reform. While the
Bank‟s Inspection Panel did not find sufficient grounds for an investigation based on an analysis
of the facts presented by both inspection requesters and Bank‟s management 33 , multiple and
ongoing legal disputes instituted by groups of officers at field formations have been continuously
disrupting FBR operations at some locations since the establishment of the IRS.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

38.      Beneficiary surveys showed mixed results about the reform effectiveness with an
overall moderate improvement in perceptions about FBR’s transparency, tax facilitation,
and service delivery by the end of the project.34 Concomitant with wide deployment of IT
solutions in FBR‟s internal management systems and service delivery to taxpayers after project‟s
restructuring, stakeholders held moderately satisfactory views on the overall automation
initiatives carried out by the project. Also, some improvements on stakeholders‟ perceptions
about transparency in FBR operations were registered, mostly by legal experts, large taxpayers,
and agents/intermediaries of FBR. These and other favorable perceptions on some aspects of
reform were not equally shared by other stakeholders such as trade bodies and the medium and
small taxpayer population, signaling the overall mixed and rather insufficient achievement of
TARP‟s outcomes35 (see Section 3.2).




32
   Groups of staff voiced their concerns about alleged insufficiencies on the consultation process followed by FBR top
management towards the creation of the IRS (reportedly, only 15 days were allowed), as well as on the short timeline
allowed for the staff to decide upon the options presented.
33
  Request for inspection filed by claimants, Bank‟s management response and the Inspection Panel‟s eligibility report
are publicly available at the Bank‟s external website.
34
  By request from FBR, representative surveys were carried out in 2007 and 2011 to monitor the stakeholder‟s
perception toward the reform initiatives supported by TARP in terms of service delivery and integrity of the tax system.
The surveys were financed by TARP and conducted by Gallup and Bearing Point Pakistan, respectively.

39.         From a brief snapshot of the Survey’s findings the following results are noteworthy:

          Overall, a significant majority of stakeholders feel that FBR has facilitated taxpayers to a
           large extent.
          Majority of respondents share the view that the Expeditious Refund System (ERS) has
           achieved its target to a large extent by the end of TARP.
          The FBR website has been rated higher than other automation initiatives.
          Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms have been deteriorating.
          Overall, awareness level of TARP initiatives among stakeholders has been low.
          Tax filing procedures should be simplified.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: High

40.      FBR’s efficiency gains expected from TARP’s investment on technical assistance,
staff training, IT and physical infrastructure, depend on future strong political support and
management drive in the context of an overall challenging institutional and security
environment. Several of the reform actions achieved so far, such as the reorganization along
functional lines, the reactivation of the audit function, and improvement on ITMS, are still faced
by tangible opposition forces from within FBR, such as the partial reversal of the functional
structure in February 2011.

41.      A government dependent upon support from coalition partners in the context of a
challenging external and internal environment, combined with an unstable tenure at top
and mid-management levels at FBR36, also threatens to undermine continuity of reform
efforts. Full integration and utilization of IT systems require strong management drive to
overcome lingering opposition of rank and file officers to adopt new business processes at field
formations. Emerging internal pressures to adopt a new IT strategy, rather than consolidate the
current one, further threatens reform objectives 37 . The maturity of key reform initiatives
introduced through TARP on FBR‟s operations in terms of inter alia audit, enforcement, and the
refund system; depend on a strong M&E system within FBR, which is yet to be consolidated.
Finally, the introduction of critical tax policy reforms aimed at increasing revenue collection and
introducing fairness and efficiency in the tax system, are unlikely to be introduced in the near
term given impending elections and political tension between the Federal Government and some
Provinces to agree on a stable and efficient GST-service taxation framework.




36
  The last Chairman, FBR under TARP retired on January 2012. Since then, two Chairmen have been appointed, with
the one serving at the time of the completion of this evaluation retiring soon. For a complete inventory of number of
acting Chairmen, see Section 5.2 (a) and Annex 4B.

37
     An external study conducted in 2011 recommended that FBR adopt a new IT strategy.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Unsatisfactory

42.      The quality at entry was affected by major shortcomings, such as insufficient
identification of critical risk factors and mitigation measures, inadequate technical support
on key reform areas, and misclassification of environmental category per OP/BP 4.01 (see
Section 2.1 for details). In particular, failure in risk assessment by overestimating GoP‟s political
will and institutional buy-in to the proposed reforms by relevant stakeholders within FBR, and
inadequate provision for Bank technical assistance to support initial stages of project
implementation (e.g. IT-related TA support), affected the quality at entry. On the other hand, the
Bank and FBR teams worked closely to develop a project that was in line with GoP‟s tax
administration reform agenda. Also, sufficient resources were provided for all the components at
the design stage, particularly for information systems, physical infrastructure development, and
for training/capacity building of staff.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory, based on MS during the beginning of the project, MU before
project restructuring, and S after restructuring38.

43.      Overall, the Bank’s supervision was undertaken by adequate technical and
operational skills mix 39 , and Bank policies and procedures were properly applied and
pursued, under a difficult implementation environment. The supervision/TA missions
identified proper implementation bottlenecks and provided detailed action plans in aide
memoires/technical reports to address them, especially in the wake of project‟s restructuring by
mid-2010. Overall, during most of project life, the quality of Bank‟s supervision suffered on
account of lack of coordination between the TA team (funded by a parallel grant) and the Task
Team during 2008-09, as well as frequent changes in task team leaders (TTLs) and co-TTLs40
(see Annex 4C). The Bank‟s supervision can be divided into two distinct periods: (i) January 2005
to December 2009 (5 years), during which seven implementation reviews were conducted. After
moderately satisfactory supervision at the beginning of the project (2005-2006), the quality and
intensity of Bank supervision wavered during 2007-2009, during which period TARP had
become a problem project; and (ii) January 2010 to December 2011 (2 years) during which
another seven implementation reviews were undertaken 41 . The latter intensity of Bank
supervision took place in light of the Bank and DFID managements‟ decision to provide
sufficient resources for regular and integrated supervision to move the project out of its problem




38
  According to the Borrower‟s assessment, Bank‟s quality of supervision after restructuring was rated as Highly
Satisfactory (see Annex 7).
39
  Except that environmental aspects were not regularly covered until around mid-2010. This was essentially because
the EMP was prepared only in April 2010, after the re-categorization of the project.
40
  TARP was approved by the Bank‟s Executive Directors on December 7, 2004. Between the project approval and
December 2009, there were three TTLs and two different co-TTLs. From March 2010 onwards, the project was lead by
one TTL responsible for both Bank‟s operational and TA teams.
41
  The above reviews exclude some TA missions which were generally conducted on a quarterly basis, starting with
September 2008.

status42. While the supervision effort in some of the earlier years suffered on account of changes
in TTLs and inadequate management oversight, it was satisfactory in the last about two years, a
period during which two restructurings 43 were undertaken and, remarkably, procurements of
about US$41.6 million (58% of total disbursements under TARP) were completed during
the last 18 months (July 2010 – December 2011). Also, during the last two years of project‟s
implementation, sufficient attention was paid to fiduciary and safeguards issues.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

44.    Based on the Unsatisfactory rating under 5.1 (a), and Moderately Satisfactory rating
under 5.1 (b), the overall Bank performance is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory44.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory

45.      While recognizing the challenging country context prevailing during the TARP
period, overall, GoP showed an inconsistent commitment to its own tax administration
reform agenda, which significantly affected project’s implementation. During the initial years
of TARP45, GoP took several steps to show its strong commitment to the project, including: (a)
establishment of LTUs/MTUs; (b) confirming the Chairman, FBR for three years and renewing
the terms of the Members responsible for functional areas; (c) granting FBR greater autonomy
under the oversight of the Cabinet Committee on Finance and Revenue (CCFR); and (d)
preparation of a rationalization plan for FBR staff. In line with GoP‟s commitment to the reform
agenda, the FBR Act 2007 was enacted46. The GoP also provided relatively adequate counterpart
funds until the restructuring.

46.     However, the Government‟s commitment to major tax policy and administration reforms
wavered over time, especially during the boom years (2005-2008) when higher economic growth
generated modest revenue gains, despite limited results on its tax administration reform program
(see Sections 3.2 and 3.3). The security of tenure of key and senior FBR officials of at least three
years was a desirable requirement to move the reform agenda forward. Yet, during the nearly
seven years of project life, four Chairmen were appointed, with some of them coming from
outside the Income Tax and Customs services47 which did not go down well with some of FBR‟s


42
   A technical assistance team on tax administration (referred to as the TA team in this report) started providing
technical advice to FBR in September 2008. One joint implementation/TA teams‟ review was conducted in April 2009,
while starting with May 2010 (Restructuring mission) Bank management instructed both teams to undertake joint
reviews.
43
     A second restructuring paper was prepared in November 2011to amend the DCA, based on a request from GoP.

with a Policy Board in the Federal Board of Revenue (Amendment) Act, 2011.

staff. FBR Board members and senior officials were transferred frequently. The CCFR also did
not meet regularly to provide necessary oversight and guidance. Nor did GoP implement the plan
for the rationalization of FBR staff (see Annex 4B).

47.      The above major shortcomings impaired the achievement of the tax administration
reforms. Subsequently, the GoP committed to a significant increase in tax revenues through inter
alia: introduction of a broad-based Value Added Tax (VAT), or reformed General Sales Tax
(RGST); reintroduction of tax audits; and strengthened enforcement measures. However, despite
the critical need to implement these tax policy and tax administration reforms, which were
required to address the macroeconomic imbalances in 2009/10 and onwards, GoP was unable to
secure political consensus on the passage of the proposed VAT or RGST bill by the TARP
closing date.

(b) Implementing Agency’s Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

48.      Given the country context during TARP implementation, FBR achieved several
positive outcomes, but insufficient to be translated into higher tax/GDP ratio by project’s
closing date (See Section 3.2). Positive outcomes included inter alia: completion of several
physical and IT infrastructure related sub-projects at several locations across Pakistan;
introduction of the universal tax assessment scheme; significant increases in the number of
registered and active taxpayers, electronic return filers for both income and sales taxes, and in the
volume and timeliness of sales tax refunds, especially to exporters. Notably, the PMU team
showed a remarkable improvement in the last 18 months of project’s life under the
leadership of a dedicated and committed manager resulting in completed procurements for
about US$41.6 million – 58% of total disbursements under TARP48.

49.     However, FBR management contributed to the delays in TARP implementation and
displayed an overall insufficient commitment to the reform agenda by not taking necessary
decisions in its own domain in a timely manner. Examples in this context include inter alia:

      i.    Long delay in, or inattention to, the implementation of Bank missions‟ recommendations
            relating to the strengthening of the PMU49, monitoring of the KPIs, ensuring coordination
            at FBR HQs and with field formations, and the enhancement of enforcement and audit
            actions;

     ii.    Indecision of over two years on the IT strategy to be followed to procure the tax
            management system between off-the-shelf solutions or own design of systems through
            the Pakistan Revenue Automation Ltd (PRAL50). Once a decision on the latter option was

     The performance of the PMU during the last 18 months of project implementation is considered highly satisfactory.

proved to be unsuccessful (see Annex 7, para 19).

            made, FBR failed to mobilize resources to adequately monitor the internal development
            of ITMS by PRAL, resulting in non integrated tax management systems;

     iii.   Failure to appoint a Member solely responsible for the coordination and monitoring
            function, both within FBR HQs Wings and between HQs and field offices, resulted in
            weak management of the reform action plan;

     iv.    FBR‟s inability to carry out agreed actions based on its own action plan51 such as FBR‟s
            reversal of decisions agreed with the Bank on moving to a functionally integrated
            organization, a key pillar of the overall TARP reform plan;

      v.    FBR‟s inability to provide security of tenure at mid-management level; and

     vi.    Delays in implementation of the training program until the last year resulted in under-
            utilization of the IT systems. Because of the delays experienced in its early years of
            implementation, the project suffered from slow disbursements.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory

50.    The overall rating is based on the ratings under 5.2 (a) and 5.2 (b), considering
major shortcomings described above which hampered project implementation, such as
Borrower’s inability to take decisive action on key tax policy reforms, frequent changes at
senior management level at FBR HQs and PMU, and lack of adequate M&E arrangements.

6. Lessons Learned

51.   The major lessons learned from the implementation and outcome of TARP are
summarized below.

       i.   Substantial enhancement of tax administration effectiveness requires fundamental
            organizational change. Revenue administration reforms entail the implementation of
            substantial organizational reforms with the potential to disrupt operations at field
            formations and inflame staff‟s stiff resistance to change. Extensive consultations with
            stakeholders using a bottom-up participatory process, constructive dialogue, and adequate
            risk mitigation measures at the outset are needed. Reorganization action plans need to be
            phased carefully over a realistic period, while adequate safeguards and ongoing
            monitoring to facilitate stakeholders buy-in and to address perceived or real inequalities
            among staff, need to be actively undertaken through an effective communications and
            outreach program.

      ii.   Revenue targets could be an unsuitable performance outcome indicator for revenue
            administration reform projects. The use of revenue targets as major development
            outcome KPI makes it difficult to track pure revenue administration performance,
            dislocates the input-output-outcome result chain, and could introduce wrong incentives
            for revenue agency‟s managers to engage in ad-hoc and short-term revenue measures,
            rather than mid- and long-term institutional building reforms. Tax gap (difference

  Serious ownership issues were detected among rank and file FBR‟s officers about the Action Plan agreed by the
Bank‟s TA team and the FBR management team in September-October 2008.



                                                     19
        between potential and observed outcome, both at the overall tax system level or by type
        of functions, taxpayers or taxes) is a measure better suited to gauge a tax agency‟s
        performance.

 iii.   Tax policy and other legal reforms must be identified and prepared in advance of
        project implementation if expected increases in tax administration effectiveness and
        tax collection are to be achieved. In case tax policy reforms are not introduced in a
        timely and effective way, mitigating measures must be in place along with the needed
        political and institutional commitment to carry them out. Tax policy and other legal
        changes need to be taken in parallel with institutional capacity development to achieve
        full benefits from planned reforms.

 iv.    A broader and continued policy dialogue on tax reform is needed in parallel to
        increase likelihood of success of revenue administration reforms. Supervision of
        investment projects can quickly get bogged down in the minutiae of implementation
        issues, diverting attention from a broader policy dialogue on fundamental tax reform that
        is critical to ensure that project outputs are converted into sustainable results.

  v.    To be effective, newly deployed IT systems must be accompanied by requisite
        operating business procedures and continuous training, following a solid strategy set
        out at preparation stage with a holistic view on both operational and institutional
        reform. There also needs to be sufficient incentives for staff to adopt new procedures,
        through the development and implementation of new business processes that the staff can
        be trained in and evaluated against. As part of the project monitoring system, it is
        important to ensure that when new IT applications are introduced in the field: (a) they
        are field tested, (b) adequate training in new business processes is provided to users, (c)
        adopting the new procedures is identified in strategic plans, and (d) rewards or
        recognition of staff for adopting new processes are in place.

 vi.    The continuity of the Bank’s Task Team, with the right mix of technical skills and
        Bank operational experience, is a necessary condition for successful supervision of
        revenue administration projects. TARP implementation has demonstrated the need for
        Bank‟s Task Teams to maintain a continued, comprehensive and long term focus on the
        entire tax system with a strong operational support on Bank operations. To be effective,
        Bank‟s support on revenue administration reform needs to address institutional building,
        tax policy analysis, political economy/governance considerations, and emerging
        operational issues in an integrated way.

vii.    Stand-alone investment loans may not be the most appropriate instrument for
        supporting major tax reform. Effective support of high-risk/high return investment
        such as fundamental tax reform requires an array of Bank‟s instruments suited to tackle
        capacity building, tax policy, legislative reforms, and political economy analysis towards
        specific and long term maturing development objectives. Flexible and results-oriented
        lending instruments supporting a tax reform strategy with sensible sequencing of actions,
        greater recognition of political economy factors and the governance context, robust TA
        support, and continued policy dialogue, are best suited to bring sustained development
        objective results compared to the traditional, stand-alone investment lending approach.

viii.   Technical assistance can be effective in supporting tax administration reform if the
        revenue agency has full ownership of the program, and the TA is well designed and
        provided in a timely manner. Technical assistance support contributes to better dialog
        with counterparts, keeps track of project‟s ongoing activities, and helps in redirecting


                                               20
        assistance to meet capacity gaps and maintain commitment as needed, especially when
        implementation issues prove more challenging than anticipated. However, all sources of
        TA, including those provided by parallel instruments, need to be fully integrated under a
        single operation with fully coordinated Bank supervision.

 ix.    To increase likelihood of tax reform success, a thorough and systematic political
        economy analysis (PEA) should not only be seen as a desirable feature, but rather as
        a key component of project design and implementation. As taxation proves to be a
        development area with increasing interaction between economics and politics, investment
        on PEA analytic work could result in a better design, timing, and sequencing of Bank
        supported reform plans. PEA may also provide teams with a better understanding of the
        likely reform outcomes to be expected from the interaction of multiple stakeholders,
        within imperfect political markets, weak institutions, and uncertain economic conditions.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies:

52.     The Borrower noted in their Project Completion Report (PCR) that the Bank‟s
supervision was strong at the beginning of the project but over time became weaker, suggesting
that feedback and requests for clearances took longer, leading to many procurement delays.
However, it was stated that after TARP‟s restructuring, feedback and support was excellent. The
Borrower cites as evidence that 58 percent of expenditure occurred after restructuring; moreover,
during the first five and a half years of the project, total expenditure was PKR 2.1 billion (US$
30.8m), while after restructuring (18 months) it was PKR 3.4 billion (US$41.6m). The Bank‟s
overall performance after restructuring was rated as “highly satisfactory? by the Borrower.

53.     The Borrower‟s PCR has highlighted a number of lessons learned including: (i) the
provision for technical assistance should be driven by the demand of the implementing agency
(only 22% of funds allocated for TA-consultancies were used by FBR); (ii) business process
reengineering and related automated applications must be fully integrated throughout the tax
administration with appropriate management and training aspects; (iii) competent officials should
be identified from within the organization, and adequately trained for positions within the PMU
for the entire length of the project, is a better option than relying on private sector consultants;
and, (iv) SOPs/Manuals should be prepared prior to commencement of the project to facilitate
implementation. Also, the Borrower made several suggestions for improving the Bank‟s
procurement processes. The above lessons have been reflected in the main section on lessons
learned (see Section 6).

54.      The Borrower has observed that: (i) the overall rating was downgraded from moderately
satisfactory to moderately unsatisfactory on account of non-implementation of 15 of the 22
priority measures agreed in April 2011, (ii) of the FBR‟s 2008 Action Plan, which was the
blueprint for the restructuring, 100 activities and their subtasks were completely implemented,
(iii) substantial improvements under the project have established the foundation of future and
deeper reforms, and (iv) the full extent of the reforms cannot be fully captured quantitatively by
the KPIs and that in that context, from the Borrower‟s perspective, the PDOs were basically
achieved under the restructured TARP.

55.     This difference in perception between the Bank and the Borrower on the achievement of
project PDOs and impact of activities may be due to an emphasis on an array of quantitative
indicators that the counterpart suggests do not accurately capture the overall benefits of the


                                                21
project accruing to FBR. This may be due to FBR‟s perception that the institution building that
took place was not subject to equal weight in assessing project outcomes. In the Bank‟s view,
substantial investments under TARP have contributed to improvement in physical and IT related
infrastructure, but these investments are yet to be translated into sustained outcomes to achieve
the reform objectives (see Annex 7).

56.     The implementing agency‟s comments on the draft ICR have been included in Annex 7.
In terms of some of the comments raised on the number of staff trained, status of HRM policy
and strengthening of appeals function, these have been reflected in the ICR.

(b) Cofinanciers:

57.     According to DFID‟s PCR, given that much of the progress achieved by TARP occurred
during the last two years of implementation in the midst of an overall deteriorating political and
macro-economic environment, it is important to have a thorough understanding of the
political context when engaging in institutional reform. Within a challenging implementation
environment, DFID recognizes that a more active oversight was required to keep track on
implementation progress and maintain a continued policy dialogue on issues affecting project‟s
performance (see Annex 8 for a summary of DFID’s PCR).

58.     In hindsight, the Bank recognizes that for most part of project implementation, a more
active and productive policy dialogue between the Bank and DFID with GoP, on fundamental
decisions affecting revenue mobilization and institution building at FBR, was required to address
timely implementation insufficiencies within a highly complex and changing environment. Also,
the Bank acknowledges the importance of conducting timely political economy analysis (PEA)
and social /stakeholder assessments when engaged on institutional reform projects like TARP
(see Section 6- ix).

     Note: Because of fluctuations of the SDR exchange rates against the US dollar and Pound Sterling during the
     implementation period, the DFID grant of GBP 12.152m did not translate into US$23m. It resulted in about
     US$18.539m (as shown above) which was fully utilized. The shortfall in the DFID grant was offset by the IDA Credit
     on account of the depreciation of the US dollar against the SDR.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Economic Analysis

The main economic benefits identified at project appraisal were: “(i) increase in government
revenues as a result of a widening of the tax base in terms of more taxpayers and transactions
coming into the tax net; (ii) improvement in customs procedures aim to reduce the average time
to clear customs; (iii) improvement in voluntary tax compliance rates implying early revenue
generation for the government; (iv) reduction in taxpayers‟ costs associated with tax compliance;
(v) economic-wide gains to the private sector as an increasing number of economic agents operate
under the same set of rules and taxes; sate reduction in taxpayers‟ costs associated with tax
compliance; and, (vi) greater predictability of tax liability and lower costs of doing business for
the private sector?. Acknowledging that not all economic benefits associated with tax
administration performance are measurable, only economic benefits (i) to (iv) were estimated at
appraisal. Assuming a set of assumptions in terms of macroeconomic and financial variables, the
relevant economic rate of return (ERR) for the project was 119.7 %54.

A re-estimation of the ERR at completion was carried out under different variables and
assumptions; hence the results are not comparable. From the economic benefits identified at
appraisal, the economic appraisal at completion dropped variables (i) to (iii) above on account of
the following factors: (a) the flow of project‟s benefits in terms of government revenues is not
considered as an economic benefit since taxes and subsidies are usually removed from project‟s
appraisal from the economic point of view as they relate only to transfers between government
and the private sector55; (b) there is no way to link savings in terms of administrative costs to
FBR as a result of changes in compliance rates; and, (c) the restructured project dropped the trade
facilitation component related to customs administration.

Therefore, the estimation of the ERR at completion included only the reduction in taxpayers‟
costs associated with tax compliance as the sole variable. Considering its major contribution
towards this end, the economic benefits associated with savings for taxpayers using FBR‟s e-
filing capabilities deployed through TARP were estimated. For this purpose, the ERR estimation
was carried out under the following key information and assumptions: (a) On average, taxpayers
in Pakistan took 599 hours per year to pay taxes in 200756; (b) e-filing contributes, on average,
savings of up to 15 percent of total taxpayers time57; and (c) e-filers total population reached
366,159 to FY 2010/11; (d) opportunity costs associated with major tax filing in Pakistan, such as
hiring of tax accountants, was estimated based in information from local sources. Based on this,
the ERR associated with the project is estimated to be 624%.58

  Savings are expected to increase through time as taxpayers become more familiar and confident with e filing
procedures.

e-payment are expected to be substantial according to the Handbook for Tax Simplification, Investment Climate

Financial Analysis

At appraisal, the estimation of project‟s financial analysis was carried out under the assumption
that the underlining financial benefits would be expected from increased federal tax receipts. For
this purpose, revenue collections were estimated through regression analysis by using the
buoyancy coefficient of tax revenue with respect to GDP growth under different scenarios.
Assuming a buoyancy coefficient of 1.2 and other macro variables projections (e.g. GDP growth,
exchange rate, discount rate and inflation), a stream of financial benefits was estimated through
the project life. The estimated project cost at appraisal was also used as input in the financial
analysis. As a result of the financial analysis, the estimated financial rate of return (FRR) for the
project at appraisal ranged from 302.3% to 522%, depending on the assumptions used under
different scenarios.

The FRR at completion was not re-estimated considering that the assumptions used to estimate
the financial rate of return of the project at appraisal seem unsustainable in hindsight for the
following reasons:

        (i) The very nature of tax administration reform projects makes it extremely difficult to
        quantify the change on revenue collection due to change in tax administration
        performance, so that it could be isolated from other variables affecting receipts, such as
        tax policy changes (e.g. reforms on GST, or income tax structure), and changing
        economic conditions on underlining variables affecting tax bases (e.g. nominal GDP
        growth, inflation, exchange rates). The association of total tax revenue to revenue
        administration performance could be assessed under stable economic conditions, different
        from the highly evolving economic conditions observed in Pakistan during the project‟s
        life.

        (ii) The identification of financial benefits for project appraisal purposes in the case of
        on-going operations - such as FBR‟s - entails the need to identify the flow of marginal
        (rather than total) benefits and costs during project life. At appraisal, the flow of
        estimated total federal revenue collection for the upcoming five years was assumed as
        project‟s financial benefits, notwithstanding the fact that most of this flow would have
        been received by FBR anyway had the project not been implemented. The lack of use of
        alternative parameters to adequately gauge project‟s marginal benefits at the outset makes
        unviable the re-estimation of a comparable FRR at project‟s completion.

        (iii) At appraisal, the buoyancy coefficient (defined as the ratio of change of federal tax
        revenue collection to change in GDP or other underlining macro variable) was used to
        estimate revenue collection, and hence project‟s financial benefits, through project life.
        However, for an adequate revenue forecasting exercise, the tax elasticity coefficient
        (same as buoyancy, except that tax revenue series is adjusted to eliminate the impact of
        discretionary policy reforms introduced through time) represents a more accurate tool of
        analysis. So even under the assumption of total identification of financial benefits to
        revenue collection, the replication of the FRR at completion using the tax buoyancy
        coefficient would have produced a rather distorted picture of project‟s outcomes from the
        financial point of view, especially considering the volatile economic conditions in
        Pakistan during the project life.

Lack of adequate data 59 at project‟s completion severely constrains the elaboration of an
alternative financial analysis set out for traditional Bank‟s economic and financial evaluation.
Nevertheless, an overview of FBR‟s tax collection, the expected impact of TARP‟s outcomes,
and a discussion of GST productivity as a proxy of revenue administration performance is
elaborated below (Section 3.2 includes a summary of this analysis).

Assessment of relevance and achievement of Project Development Outcomes

Low revenue mobilization stands out as one of the long and most pressing development
challenges in Pakistan. This is the result of a combination of factors, such as inefficient tax
administration, narrow and skewed tax structure, complex and obsolete legislation, non-
transparent tax system, rent seeking behavior, and rampant tax evasion. As a consequence, the
federal tax to GDP ratio has declined to 8.6 percent of GDP in 2010/11 from 9.3 percent of GDP
a decade ago (Table 1), after a steady decline during the last few years. At current levels, the tax
ratio is not only the lowest in Pakistan for the last 35 years, but also one of the lowest in the world.

Exceptionally weak domestic sources of revenue in Pakistan reduce fiscal space to increase
allocation of public expenditure on key social and physical infrastructure required to meet
the MDGs, promote growth and curb poverty levels. Also, the low and unstable source of
revenues threatens macroeconomic stability, exposing Pakistan to higher levels of vulnerabilities
during economic downturns. Finally, insufficient domestic revenue mobilization strains debt
sustainability (debt to GDP ratio currently reaches 60 percent of GDP, one of the highest in the
region), increases dependency on foreign aid and inflationary sources of revenue, and promotes
crowding out of private sector investment through higher public deficits. As a result, revenue
mobilization will continue to be a fundamental challenge to address fiscal constraints and core
development objectives in the years to come.

The underlining development objective in terms of FBR tax-GDP ratio was not achieved,
despite progress in key intermediate outputs and substantial investments in IT, physical and
human infrastructure at FBR. Notwithstanding moderate gains during 2004/05 to 2008/09,
FBR tax-GDP collection has dropped substantially to reach 8.6 percent of GDP by the end of FY
2010/11, the lowest level in more than two decades.

          Period 2005-08: Economic boom, combined with slow implementation of TARP

Overall economic performance maintained the expansionary trend started in 2001, mainly driven
by external financial flows and loose monetary policy. As a result, FBR tax-GDP ratio increased
at a sustained pace reaching 9.8 percent of GDP by 2007/08. Notwithstanding TARP‟s
effectiveness in early 2005, increased levels of tax collection are explained by modest
improvements in income tax buoyancy, rather than enhanced operation efforts from FBR. Project
implementation delays during the first years of TARP restricted the scope for any substantial
improvement in tax administration efficiency. 60 In fact, the momentum for tax administration
reform weakened during this economic expansion period, as modest increases in tax buoyancy
reduced the urgency for fundamental changes in tax administration performance.

          Period 2008-11: Economic crisis and natural disasters, combined with turnaround of
           TARP implementation

The steep decline in tax-GDP ratio during this period is partly explained by the negative effect on
economic activity by natural disasters, and an overall unfavorable external and domestic
environment, including deteriorating security situation. Unparalleled devastation caused by two
major floods during 2010-11 had a significant and long lasting effect on economic activity,
further deteriorating eroded tax bases and tax compliance levels. On the other hand, the lack of a
diversified export base and the need to import oil and food induced the economy to increased
vulnerability during a period of high fluctuations in international commodity prices. Finally, an
increasingly adverse political climate derailed the proposal to implement a new broad-based
RGST – the cornerstone of the tax policy strategy to enhance revenue collection and support the
tax administration reform program.

                                                As a result, FBR maintained progress against some key
           Filers             Active taxpayers  outcome indicators. Positive results by 2010/11
                                                included: (i) registered and active taxpayers increased
by 6.2% from 2.984 million to 3.167 million; (ii) electronic return filers increased by 6% for sales
tax, with income tax filers registering a 27% increase in FY10 (FY11 returns have yet to be
filed61); (iii) registered and active taxpayers for Income Tax and Sales Tax (e-enrolled, liable to e-
file) increased by 29% and 13%, respectively, and (iv) the amounts of refunds to taxpayers as
well as the efficiency for processing refunds increased substantially as a result of efforts to clear
the backlog of Sales Tax refunds pending for up to 10 years.

However, positive trends in some key outputs achieved during the final years of project
implementation fell short of overcoming shrinking revenue performance (Graph 2). FBR‟s
lower than expected overall performance by end of project life is associated with three major
shortcomings:

(a) Slow integration of FBR organization along functional lines, because of resistance from staff
of the Customs and Excise Group (CEG) and the Income Tax Group (ITG), lack of monitoring
and evaluation mechanisms and an unstable tenure at mid-management levels undermining the
efficiency and effectiveness of FBR to implement its reform action plan.

(b) Underutilization of IT-related systems due to poor integration of the new systems into re-
engineered business processes, weak management follow up on implementation of systems, and
opposition of FBR staff to adopt new business processes based on newly deployed systems at
field formations; and

(c) Continued weakness of the audit function, associated with lower than expected performance
by the audit program delivered by private accounting firms during the outsourcing program, lack
of a centralized-based audit function in charge of planning, programming and monitoring of
results, poor training, and unfavorable results for FBR on legal disputes from tax tribunals.

Break in the chain of reforms had consequences for the achievement of outcomes envisioned
by the project. Without the reorganization of the FBR along functional lines, the redefinition of
business processes was left in limbo. Without the implementation of new business processes,
related IT investments were insufficiently incorporated into business routines. Without the new
IT systems, training and change management investments were delayed. The shift from co-
location of tax streams to actual functional integration of tax administration – along with the
concomitant changes in business processes, IT systems and HR reforms – did not have consistent
commitment and support from within the FBR. At root of the problems was a lack of consistent

Productivity assessment

The GST productivity ratio represents a useful diagnostic tool to assess revenue efficiency
and FBR performance during project’s lifespan. Defined as the ratio of VAT revenues to GDP
divided by the statutory rate, productivity ratio approximates the ability of the tax system to raise
revenues by each percentage point of standard rate under a given policy and enforcement
environment. Although the VAT productivity ratio is typically used in cross sectional analysis to
assess VAT revenue performance worldwide, the construction of a time series for a given country
also serves as a diagnostic tool to gauge tax administration performance through time, when
controlled for tax policy changes.

In the case of Pakistan, the construction of a time series for the GST productivity ratio provides a
useful insight of FBR‟s performance trends throughout the project‟s life. In general, VAT/GST
productivity depends on two factors: (i) structural features of tax design, such as the scope of the
base, exemption threshold and number of tax rates; and (ii) level of compliance enforced by tax
administration efforts. By controlling the tax rate and the coverage of the tax base, GST
productivity ratio gauges the extent to which FBR overall performs, considering the following
factors:

A. GST structure in Pakistan has not suffered major changes during project‟s life other than the
   general statutory rate, which is inherently controlled by the computation of the productivity
   ratio. Despite efforts to overhaul the indirect taxation structure by introducing a reformed
   GST featured with few exemptions and wide coverage of goods and services, the current
   narrow-based GST in Pakistan has remained almost entirely unchanged throughout 2005-
   2012 yielding rather low buoyancy gains (tax buoyancy coefficient of only 0.47). Therefore,
   lack of major policy changes allows the GST productivity index to isolate the pure FBR
   performance effort during the reform period.

B. Different from other sources of tax revenue in Pakistan, administration of GST entails a full
   fledged operation of major FBR functionalities, including: registration, monthly tax return
   processing, collection, refunds, audit and enforcement. GST operation also integrates joint
   effort from both internal revenue administration and customs since GST import tax is
   collected at the borders and zero-rating is targeted for export operations, besides other
   activities. Hence, FBR‟s performance on GST administration represents a fair indicator to
   gauge its overall corporate effort during project‟s life.

To estimate GST performance for Pakistan, a time series was constructed using nominal GST
collection, GDP and general GST tax rate. As a result of this computation, GST productivity
in Pakistan turns out to be only 23 percent, compared with an average ratio of 34 percent
worldwide62.




62
  See “The Modern VAT?, Ebrill, Keen, Bodin and Summers, International Monetary Fund, 2001. In the case of
Pakistan, a one percent of GST standard rate is associated with a collection of only about 0.23 percent of GDP in
Pakistan, while the rest of the world raises an average of 0.34 percent of GDP.

     FBR Tax Ratio    100       103.0       107.5     108.3     100.1     98.6       95.0    3).

Overall, FBR‟s tax-GDP ratio and GST productivity index followed a similar pattern throughout
reform implementation, signaling declining performance in both tax policy and administration.
Nevertheless during the economic boom period (2005-08) GST productivity index showed a
rather declining trend despite modest buoyancy gains in FBR revenue collection, signaling
relatively poor tax administration performance amidst relatively favorable overall economic
conditions. This trend supports earlier assumptions described above related to low urgency for tax
administration reform perceived by GoP/FBR during the economic boom period. Slow
implementation of TARP during this period, especially related to IT deployment and functional
integration, isolates any association between tax administration performance and project
implementation during this period.

During the economic crisis period and subsequent years (2008-11), GST productivity index
declined at a higher rate compared to FBR tax-GDP despite a swift turnaround in project
implementation and concomitant positive trends in some outputs by the last two years of project
life (see section above). Arguably, major external shocks experienced by the Pakistani economy
during this period with disrupting effects on economic activity - such as the major floods during
2010/11 - further undermined weak compliance levels in Pakistan63 beyond FBR capabilities to
mitigate its effects. Nevertheless, lackluster results in reform implementation described in the
precedent section, especially those related to short term actions aimed at curbing evasion through
more effective enforcement actions by the final year of project implementation, strongly suggests
a weak FBR performance from 2008 onwards, far from the project‟s objectives envisioned at the
outset.

  Economic downturns typically expose tax administrations to emerging challenges due to expected decline of tax file
turnaround, increased accumulation of arrears stock, lower payment of withholding taxes, and increase in net operating
losses.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results64 (Summary)

In order to monitor the Tax Administration Reform Program (TARP), stakeholders‟ perception
periodic survey was an integral part of the reform initiatives. The first round of a country wide
stakeholders‟ perception survey was conducted in the year 2007. FBR contracted M/S
BearingPoint for second round of perception survey in 2011. BearingPoint carried out a
nationally representative survey of the stakeholders to determine the degree of improvements
between the two surveys. Following is a brief summary and a graph of the survey findings:

       i.   Overall, awareness level of TARP initiatives among stakeholders has been low. However,
            it is on higher side for large taxpayers and legal experts.
      ii.   Overall user ratings (scale 1-5); FBR Employees and Large Tax Payers assigned above
            3.0, while the user rating given by all other stakeholders is 2.64.
     iii.   Focusing on the aspect of whether FBR supports taxpayers who want to do the right
            things, the trend indicates that majority is in agreement.
     iv.    The perception about transparency in FBR has also improved, as the current results
            indicate significant increase in high level of transparency in comparison to previous
            study.
      v.    Higher level of transparency is observed by the legal experts, large tax payers and
            agents/intermediaries in FBR. However, individuals, small businesses and opinion
            makers perceive low level of transparency.
     vi.    There are more positive responses concerning understanding about functions of FBR and
            awareness of certain rights related to the tax system.
 vii.       Tax filing procedures have become more complex for the stakeholders.
viii.       According to the satisfaction levels of all stakeholders, the overall automation initiatives
            of FBR are regarded as being moderately satisfactory.
     ix.    The FBR website has been rated higher than other automation initiatives.
      x.    Overall, a significant majority of stakeholders feel that e.FBR has facilitated tax payers to
            a large extent.
     xi.    Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) negative trend has been observed from the previous
            study.
 xii.       Stakeholders are very positive about the objectives of Tax Administration Reform Project
            (TARP) for facilitating the Large Taxpayers and almost all the aspects of LTUs.
xiii.       Majority of respondents share the view that the Expeditious Refund System has achieved
            its target of quicker refund claim processing to a large extent.
xiv.        Most of the stakeholders perceive that RTO/Model Customs Collectorate (MCC) officials
            are performing their duties to a large extent, however opinion of trade bodies indicate a
            lower level of performance.
 xv.        Tax audit is an important component of TARP. Improvement in the tax audit system has
            been observed by large tax payers, tax authorities and trade bodies in most of the aspects
            during the past few years. This positive perception, however, is not shared by small and
            medium businesses.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's PCR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Summary of Borrower’s PCR

Ground work for tax reforms in FBR occurred between 1999-2000. First detailed report,
commonly known as Shahid Hussain Report, was produced on April 14, 2001. Pilots were run
from 2002 – 2004. Thus, extensive work was done prior to launching main TARP from January
2005. Despite a pre-project preparation spread over five years, overall implementation
performance remained just „moderately satisfactory‟. This has necessitated identifying the lessons
learned in this process, which include both successes and failures. The risk classification for
TARP was „substantial risk‟ and it has fully met that classification. Suggested mitigation
measures were largely unsuccessful in reducing the risk of the project. The Bank performance
was highly productive in the start, but with the passage of time the Bank supervision became
weaker. The performance of the Bank‟s team after TARP restructuring in 2010 was highly
satisfactory.

Lessons learned have been classified under broad categories for convenience of consultation.

Ownership

1. Reform can only succeed with strong ownership and commitment. Importance of ownership,
   change management and incremental reforms in public sector institutional modernization
   need to be kept alive and consistent. At the time of start of the project in January 2005, there
   was a vibrant ownership of the project which with the passage of time weakened due to
   multiple variables. Momentum for tax administration reform could not be maintained during
   the economic „boom‟ years as increases in tax collections compromised the urgency for
   maintaining tempo in tax reforms. By 2007, the project had landed into problem area.

2. Continuity in the leadership of the tax agency provides an important contribution to
   successful implementation of the reform process. During TARP implementation command at
   Chairman FBR level was changed four (4) times. During seven years‟ project life, seven (7)
   Project Directors had to step in and out.

3. Concerned wings of FBR rarely remained proactive in reform processes; therefore, this
   lacked ownership under a misconception that the same was a job of TARP Wing. Whereas,
   the reforms were primarily their area for achieving results. TARP wing was just an
   implementing arm. In future there is a need to create a small and smart forum like reforms
   monitoring Steering Committee with representation of the concerned Wings.

4. Integration of different IT systems is a process, which involves a multitude of stakeholders. It
   is important to involve these stakeholders actively in the design, monitoring and active
   management of the reform process. There has to be an overall supervisory body to control
   the scattered development and introduction of different IT systems. This has to be constant
   feature for ensuring ownership and success of reforms.

5. A lesson has been learned that complete caution should be exercised while identifying the
   activities to be included in the project. In TARP, off the shelf procurement of IT systems for
   Customs, ITMS and HRIS were among major activities. After launching the project, lot of
   efforts and resources were spent for acquisition of these systems but after wastage of more
   than two years this had to be scrapped. Hence, for any related project an in-depth
   review/study may be required.


                                                56
6. In revised PC-I, major consultancy activities like Organization and Management, Compliance
   Management, Adopting Responsive IT System, TARP Implementation could not be initiated
   because the concerned wings regretted to take their ownership. It was experienced during
   project implementation that concerned Wings of the Board were reluctant to go for availing
   any consultancy service. Technical Assistance (Consultancies) is the only major area under
   TARP where utilization remained extremely on lower side. In PC-I an amount of Rs.629.9
   million was earmarked which was equivalent to US$ 8.188 million. Against this allocation,
   total utilization at the end of the project was Rs.142 million only equivalent to US$ 2.728
   million. In percentage terms, utilization in Pak rupees was just 22.5%. For any future
   program, lessons already learned may be kept in view to ensure the ownership of the activity.

Human Resource (HR)

7. Any change that affects field workers and the way they do their job has the potential to be
   disruptive. There has to be a plan to ensure that all the staff is at least informed and
   understands as to what changes are being made and there is a mechanism to address the
   concerns of rank and seniority. There should be an ongoing monitoring mechanism to ensure
   buy-in or to find a way to address perceived set-backs in the transition. Corrective actions
   need senior management participation and a contingency plan should be in place if any
   resistance comes to the notice.

Requirement of Pragmatic Approach

8. At one point of time, it was decided to go for a completely new VAT Law. Lot of efforts and
   resources were spent for this purpose but ultimately it could not succeed. A new service
   group was created in haste which delayed project implementation process. There was a need
   for in-depth analysis of the related issues. In both these cases, stakeholders were required to
   be taken on board to address the risk involved in the decisions. Workable mitigating measures
   were to be put in place.

Design

9. Project design is the basic building block for entire structure. For successful completion of
   any project and to achieve the desired objectives, project identification/preparation plays an
   important role and contribute a lot. This requires extra efforts at the time of identification and
   preparation of the project and its components. At this stage, all stakeholders should be taken
   on board for ensuring ownership of the activity.

10. Design of the TARP project with an original cost estimate of US$ 149 million to be
    implemented in five years time span vis-à-vis capacity of the implementing agency was over
    ambitious. Consequently, in pursuance of review of the implementation progress in 2008, an
    amount of US$ 49 million was determined to be surrendered to the World Bank. At the end,
    another US$ 7 million plus will be surrendered. This needs to be taken care of for any
    identical project.

Business Process Re-engineering (BPR)

11. Business process re-engineering and related automated applications must be fully integrated
    throughout the tax administration with appropriate management of the organizational
    transition including human resource and training aspects as central part of the process.


                                                 57
Information Technology (IT)

12. Information Technology is the backbone of all the processes in reformed structure. Entire
    structure of functional distribution of work is to be based on formidable ITMS. Efforts for the
    purpose lacked direction. IT systems including ITMS and TAMS, etc. have been introduced.
    New IT systems are ineffective unless they are complemented with new operating procedures
    and continued strength. Changing old ways of doing business requires that the staff
    understands what is being changed and why in addition to being trained in the procedures.
    Any new introduction of IT system should be through the development and implementation
    of new SOPs for the purpose.

13. During implementation, especially at the initial stage, FBR faced certain difficulties in IT
    related procurement especially for ITMS and HRIS. In this process, more than two years
    were lost. So it is always important to adopt the right path to achieve the desired objective.
    All IT procurements are complex in nature which needs to be planned with caution. These
    procurements are always time consuming.

14. Moving to an e-Tax system is an essential process for reducing the compliance and
    administrative burden and the risk of corruption. Increasing the use of electronic tools, in
    particularly e-filing, by taxpayers therefore is important. This requires in addition to
    providing incentives for e-filing to eliminate obstacles and create a workable platform for use
    of e-tax.

15. Different IT systems developed by the FBR‟s field formations required integration. There
    was no integration management in place which could have catered for alignment of the
    components.

16. IT procurements and particularly procurement of software systems are highly complex in
    nature. ICT Hardware was procured which required focus on „sizing‟ and „hardware
    optimization‟. These activities were not dove tailed in a logical manner resulting in
    impediments to project execution within the procurement portfolio.

Project Management Unit (PMU)

17. TARP typically consisted of new project designed towards the achievement of common
    PDOs. It had all the enumerators of a complex program and therefore required, in totality, a
    well trained and focused management team to cover the entire ambit of the program. There
    were unnecessary interruptions The Bank has commended the Project Management Unit
    (PMU) for having made extra ordinary efforts since restructuring in September, 2010 to put
    in place robust business processes and infrastructure related to enforcement, IT, organization
    and HR, laying down the foundation for future reforms. It is pertinent to highlight that before
    restructuring (w.e.f 14.9.2010) TARP was only able to spend Rs.2.8 billion only in six (6)
    years, whereas after restructuring and during around one year, Rs.2.7 billion have been spent
    on procurement of works, goods, training and technical assistance. Thus, at expenditure front,
    around 50% of the entire progress was achieved during ending year of the project. Entire
    grant amount was exhausted. Savings have mostly occurred on account of depreciation in
    rupee value vis-à-vis dollar and ensuring efficiency gains and transparency in procurements.
    A great lesson was learned that once there is strong commitment, then unprecedented result
    become achievable.



                                                58
18. In recent two years, highly useful lesson was learned that in case there is uniformity in
    approach between PMU/FBR and its counterpart team in the Bank then there can be
    wonderful results. Both the teams had a strong intention to deliver and all delaying slip shots
    were addressed with focus, speed and success. Response from the Bank‟s side was
    marvelously quick and productive. Procurements starting from preparation of bidding
    documents, invitation for bids, evaluations, award of contracts and complete implementation
    and management thereof within 7 – 8 months was par excellent. Once TARP (PMU) was
    working day in and day out then performance was overly visible. Organization is the ultimate
    beneficiary.

19. Despite unprecedented performance of TARP (PMU) during recent two years, its previous
    performance has also suffered due to multiple vulnerabilities within the given environment.
    PMU was constituted even prior to launch of TARP in January 2005 which was operating
    under a Member as Project Director (PD) reporting direct to the Chairman. PMU was
    required, as given in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) to hire full time outside
    consultants to assist in implementation of the respective project components. In pursuance of
    advice given in PAD, consultants from private sector were hired as Procurement Specialist,
    Director (PMU) and Advisor on Finance, etc. Almost all of them failed to deliver except one
    Director PMU. Persons hired from private sector have competing priorities. Whenever, they
    got better alternate options from any other source then they simply opt to move out. In this
    case, ownership assumption in the project fades away. During TARP implementation, it was
    also experienced that some of them were found interested in perpetuating their own stay
    rather than expediting the project work. Consequently, contracts of two Financial Advisors
    were not renewed. Contract of one Director (PMU) had to be terminated. This cost a lot to the
    project.

20. TARP involved procurement of works, goods and services. PMU with required level of
    competence, dedication and capacity to handle the gigantic task was required to be put in
    place right at the outset of the project. Before start of implementation, a well trained team of
    officials particularly for procurement, financial management and project monitoring and
    evaluation had to be put in place. The lesson learned is that instead of relying on hiring from
    private sector, competent officials may be identified from within the organization who should
    extensively be trained and posted in PMU.

21. During the execution of project PMU faced multiple administrative problems that badly
    affected the project progress. These included frequent transfer of PDs (7 PDs changed hands),
    frequent changes in the PMU team, capacity building and training issues, lack of
    interest/involvement of major stake holders and end users, delay in completion of works and
    timely availability of funds, etc. Persons posted in PMU should be kept there for entire life of
    the project. This should be known to the concerned officials, who should be asked to opt for it
    so that there is no disruption during implementation phase.

22. Proper job description should be prepared for persons involved in procurements, monitoring
    & evaluation. In TARP (PMU) this was lacking.

23. SOPs / Manuals should be prepared prior to introduction of the project. Persons working in
    PMU should fully be aware of the procedures and processes for doing the related job. This
    was not done for TARP (PMU).




                                                59
24. During project implementation it was required to appoint Project Directors (PDs) at
    respective site scattered throughout the country. However, comprehensive training for PDs
    was not imparted to equip them as to what they were supposed to do. They were almost
    unaware of required monitoring and evaluation mechanism. Therefore, before posting of any
    PD for undertaking implementation of any sub-activity, his/her training should be ensured
    before expecting productive feedback/output.

25. Transparency, strict adherence to the rules, quick complaint redressal mechanism and
    meeting the deadlines are the great lessons learned during project implementation which may
    be replicated for future projects. In such a voluminous work not a serious single complaint
    was lodged against tendering thereof.

26. An integral part of the PMU responsibilities was to establish `monitoring and evaluation‟
    mechanism for the project. It had to establish performance indicators as explained in the
    Project Implementation Plan (PIP) to monitor impact of the project and measure its success.
    There was no effective monitoring & evaluation (M&E) framework based upon MIS for the
    project, so management could not get the real time progress of scores of projects spread
    throughout the country and was also unable to make mid-course corrections where required.

Policy assumptions should be carefully evaluated

27. It should be ensured that policy assumptions worked out at the time of preparation of project
    are well documented and that effective mitigation strategies are in place to identify when one
    of these assumptions is proven incorrect. Suggested corrective actions may be used to provide
    some guidance on how to minimize the impact of the change in the project‟s environment.

28. The project expected that as taxpayers became more compliant due to the changes in FBR as
    a result of TARP, revenue would increase. However, the complexity of the tax system
    imposes severe restrictions on tax administration, which are a major obstacle to improve its
    effectiveness, e.g. the existence of widespread exemptions and zero rates in the ST
    complicates its administration. Tax policy reforms are indispensable to increase tax
    administration effectiveness and tax revenue.

Training

29. Major component of the project was procurement of hardware/software; it went fairly well
    and proved to be a success story in the entire project portfolio. Nevertheless, soft side of the
    project which was a corner stone for building the individual‟s capacities remained at a slower
    pace which was accelerated in 2009-10. Capacity Building Projects involve enhancement in
    capacity of institution, individuals through trainings, restructuring of organizations and
    business process re-engineering, hence, the capacity of FBR as revenue collecting agency
    remained deficient, and resultantly FBR relied much on presumptive taxation to make up the
    revenue losses, which created distortion in distribution of economic gains in the country.

Consultant (infrastructure)

30. Services of M/s NESPAK were hired through QCBS procurement methodology. This
    organization has scattered set ups located in Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi. Its Electrical
    Division is based in Lahore and IT Division in Karachi. NESPAK was also a Project
    Manager for FBR‟s infrastructure related activities. At times, bidding documents prepared by
    NESPAK were found deficient in specifications, incorrect determination of Bill of Quantities


                                                60
    (BOQs), etc. It could not even address construction related requirements of the concerned
    local governments/municipalities. Timelines could not be followed. It‟s monitoring &
    evaluation mechanism was not based on sound techniques covering design model, tracking
    tables and work breakdown structures (WBS), etc. Many delays had occurred due to faulty
    feedback/preparation of NESPAK. Thus, working experience with NESPAK was not a
    success story.

31. In case of any major project like TARP, instead of hiring services of external consultants like
    NESPAK for preparation of design layouts, procurement support and supervision of works at
    sites, organization should evaluate the possibility to engage their own engineers
    (civil/electrical), architect and quantity surveyors for the said jobs.


32. The decision to separate Public Works Department (PWD) from TARP refurbishment and
    construction activities was found to be a success. This helped to complete the projects
    smoothly and within the given timelines.

Contract Management

33. Before award of contracts for construction works/renovations, supply of goods and services,
    real ground checks regarding the capacity of the contractors/suppliers should also be
    evaluated. In theory or on paper, profile of prospective suppliers/contractors may be attractive
    but market feedback from previous clients should be obtained. Lessons were learned that
    some of the successful evaluated bidders were not able to abide by their commitments for
    contract executions.

34. Vendors who depend upon their financing sources through their head offices based in Middle
    East faced serious constraints. Release of required financing was delayed unnecessarily,
    which made the local vendors unable to pay for even small activities. During contract
    implementation, this results into avoidable complications. Effective strings are required to be
    attached for this type of vendors/suppliers.

35. Performance Security should be 10% for entire warranty period and that should not be
    reduced to 2.5% after operationalization. Some vendors simply tend to forego 2.5%
    Performance Security rather than abiding by 3 years warranty. In any case, for foreign
    vendors warranty threshold should not be less than 10%.

36. Instead of planning complex procurements in one go, it would be advisable to breakdown
    these procurements into smaller chunks. Proper sequencing is advisable.

37. Default penalty for delays, etc. was normally prescribed to the extent of 10%. In order to
    force the vendors/contractors to complete the project within the given timelines penalty
    threshold may be fixed at 20% of the contract value.

Bidders Qualifications

Interior Development & Construction Works:

38. Tender documents are required to be prepared with complete clarity. Bid data, contract data
    sheet are required to be drafted with complete care and caution to avoid subsequent mis-




                                                61
    interpretations and litigations. Likewise, each special condition of contract given in the tender
    document needs to be drafted with complete clarity.

39. In certain construction and refurbishment projects the qualifying firm, which emerged as the
    lowest evaluated responsive bidder, could not deliver the project on time. A deeper analysis
    into the problem revealed that the firm had submitted satisfactory statistics information in
    terms of its past experience while qualifying technically but had subsequently/simultaneously
    involved in so many other projects that its cash flow went under pressure and stuck-up in
    other project(s). Hence, TARP activity badly suffered in terms of physical progress as
    adequate funds were not available with the firm for executing its activities on the Critical
    Path Method (CPM). This created difficult situation when TARP was nearing its closure and
    contract cancellation was not a viable option. Even available penal provisions were not
    helpful in resolving the issue. Bidding Documents prepared by NESPAK did not contain the
    Financial Capability Analysis Clause, which could have calculated the current financial
    strength of the firm, thereby alerting the Client of its weak financial position in terms of
    project execution.

40. The Client Risk Tolerance in terms of financial variation in project cost should have been
    incorporated at the very outset in the bidding documents through Special Conditions of
    Contract. This Risk Tolerance typically prohibits the client to allow project scope creep and
    relating expenses to go beyond a certain percentage. In some construction and interior
    development activities, the contract was awarded to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder at
    a project cost which escalated more than 50% of the original cost. The lowest evaluated
    bidder won the contract but as he could not complete the project within the evaluated bid
    price, he resorted to cost variation claims, which if added originally, would have qualified the
    second or third lowest bidder. This may sometimes create transparency issues for the client.
    The Client therefore needs to establish a maximum and minimum threshold of Risk Tolerance
    in terms of contract price beyond which either the contract is not awarded or the contractor is
    not paid the variation in the activity closing phase.

Supply of Goods:

41. L/C Clauses for supply of goods should have been clearly spelt-out in bid data sheet for both
    the foreign and local suppliers. Absence of standard INCOTERM terminology for each
    category of supplier and its relation to the buyer resulted in audit objections which wasted lot
    of time and efforts for settlement thereof.

IT Goods Acquisition

42. Certain IT firms submitted bids which, prima facie, at the time of bid opening looked as
    lowest bidders and their products duly conformed to the specifications but their bids
    contained avoidable infirmities which rendered them non-responsive during bid evaluation
    process. These infirmities occurred due to incorrect filling of various bid forms in the tender
    documents by inexperienced managers who could not understand the sensitivity attached to it.
    Project would have benefited from better prices, had the firms been educated. Presence of IT
    Bid Managers should be made mandatory in the Pre-Bid Conference and it should be made
    part of evaluation process by assigning specified marks to it.




                                                 62
Project Financing

43. During execution of Project and especially during negotiations for extension from 5 to 7
    years, DFID stopped its financing through freezing its accounts. DFID was financing three
    (3) important components of TARP, namely; procurement of ICT hardware/software, training
    and technical assistance (consultancies). Due to this stoppage, no process relating to
    procurement for these activities could be started and consequently around a year was lost.
    Hence, need for timely availability of financing is highly important. In order to address this
    situation mitigating measures are required to be put in place.

44. It was experienced during implementation of the project that required PSDP allocation for the
    year was not timely available. Besides this, timely release of counterpart financing also
    suffered delays. Consequently, project activities suffered. For any smooth implementation,
    timely PSDP allocation and release will render great help to the project.

Legal constraints

45. Tax administration reform frequently requires changes in the legal framework. These
    changes must be initiated as early as possible in order to ensure a clear and sufficient legal
    basis for the reform. It is important to know ahead of time what constraints are in the law
    that would affect the anticipated changes.

Technical Assistance (TA) - Consultancy Services:

46. The Expression of Interest (EOIs) submitted by the consulting firms generally do not furnish
    necessary data required for their preliminary evaluation leading to their short-listing. The
    firms had to be contacted time and again to provide the missing information. This resulted
    into undue delay. Furthermore, the firms used to give requisite information in a jumbled-up
    manner. The consulting firms should have been given the short-listing templates and
    evaluation benchmarks by providing them in the Request For Expression of Interest (REoI).
    Earlier this has not been included in the REoI approved by the World Bank.

47. The Request For Proposal (RFP) should have contained a clause showing contract price with
    and without taxes. The contract price exclusive of taxes should be used for evaluation and the
    contract price inclusive of taxes should be got approved from the Contract Award
    Recommendation Committee (CARC). This would result in payment of consultancy fee
    which the consultant originally envisaged for his services. Absence of this feature resulted in
    bickering by both the local and foreign consultants when the consultancy fee indicated by
    them in their RFP was taxed.

48. Quality & Cost Based Selection (QCBS) does not allow dissemination of information about
    the cost estimates of the activity. Indication of base price should have been a regular feature
    in the Pre-Proposal Conference with the approval of the World Bank. Many consultancy
    activities either had to be re-tendered or dropped altogether in the wake of exorbitant prices
    offered by the consultants. This wasted valuable resources in terms of project time and effort
    consumed in evaluating their proposals.




                                                63
Assessment of Bank’s Performance:

49. The Bank performance was highly productive in the start, but with the passage of time the
    Bank supervision became weaker. The performance of the Bank‟s team after TARP
    restructuring in 2010 was highly satisfactory.

Comments on Draft ICR

Quality at entry:
50. Draft report has highlighted policy indecision on an IT modernization strategy (See first
    bullet of para 15). Two issues have been clubbed and focused, (a) out-sourcing of customs
    automation as a Public Private Partnership activity and resultant taking out of US$ 28 million
    which were intended to be disbursement on this count; and, (b) non-agreement of internal IT
    group to acquire-off-the-shelf integrated solution vs in-house development of an Integrated
    Tax Management System (ITMS) which led to a delay of more than two years. This needs
    elaboration to see it in proper context. Instead of policy indecision, there were other factors
    which cannot be overlooked. In the project design, a decision was already there to go for off-
    the-shelf integrated ITMS, therefore, no new decision was needed. In order to have a
    strengthened and working application of this solution, a team of FBR officials, on the
    suggestions of the World Bank, had visited identified developing as well as developed
    countries to see the actual implementation and operations of ITMS over there. Initially, in
    pursuance of clearance of the Bank, procurement of ITMS under single stage bidding
    methodology was undertaken which could not succeed. In view of this outcome, the Bank
    advised to go for two stage bidding process. After completion of the related processes under
    two stage bidding methodology, RFPs were received which were found deficient on two
    counts; (i) the proposed solution/product did not serve ITMS purpose of the organization;
    and, (ii) financial quotes were in excess of the available envelope for the purpose. This
    process right from single stage bidding to arrive at end of two stage bidding had taken around
    two and half years but without a success. Per force, organization was left with no option but
    to go for an alternate venture for in-house development through PRAL which could perhaps
    provide required flexibility and convenience for getting the required solution. Besides this, it
    will be more appropriate to say that IT procurement being complex in nature demanded
    proper expertise and capacity to do it which remained lacking both in the implementing
    agency as well as in the Bank during the relevant time period. Just to pin down „indecision‟
    may not be a true reflection of factual position.

Identification of risk factors and mitigation measures:

51. The project was implemented in seven (7) years. Most of the time, implementation
    environment was difficult. Risk factors were said to be identified at project design stage along
    with mitigating measures (See paras 16 & 17). For success of any project, risk factors and
    mitigating measures are required to be continuously updated even risk register may be
    required to be updated on daily or weekly basis. During the implementation, new risks crop
    up which are required to be addressed through adequate mitigating measures. In case of
    TARP, this did not happen. New risk factors were neither properly identified nor adequate
    mitigating measures were worked out and triggered, therefore, this resulted into avoidable
    wastage of time, resources and energies. This remained one of the major infirmities in this
    project.




                                                64
52. Draft report has talked about stiff resistance from vested interest groups against restructuring
    as well as reforms (See para 18). Instead of saying resistance from executive and staff, it
    will be more appropriate to say that they were less receptive to go for accelerated reforms.
    Here, two issues may be seen separately, (i) creation of a new service group and (ii) adaption
    to reforms. Legal and administrative problems had occurred after creation of a new service
    group. The staff which had gone into litigation had clearly and unequivocally stated at each
    forum that they were not against reforms in the organization rather they were seeking
    protection of their rights/privileges as well as legitimate expectations for career progression.
    Other than this, there was hardly any evidence where FBR staff was strongly resisting
    reforms. This needed to be appreciated in a context where there was aging manpower (more
    than 80%) with hardly any previous exposure to reforms / computerization and automations,
    etc., whose automated outcome was slashing of discretionary powers/authority. Since 1994,
    all recruitments in the organization are banned, therefore, no fresh blood (excluding intake at
    BS-17 level where an annual batch of officials ranging 30 – 50) enters in service after
    qualifying through national competitive examination/selection process with latest IT/
    management related education is available. TARP reforms were designed and targeted for a
    manpower of around 12 – 13 thousands against a working strength of 25 thousands. In the
    national context, it is highly difficult to bring down the level of manpower by around a 50%
    which has a direct relationship with creation of unemployment rather than providing jobs.
    Politically, this hardly remained a viable option. In the reform process, no effective
    mechanism could be adopted to address this volatile issue. In such an environment to go for
    robust reforms will always be difficult. An effective ownership of the program was not only
    required to be created rather that had to be kept alive.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E):

53. Creation and putting in place of a dynamic monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system was
    required right from day one (See para 20). This remained lacking on the part of the
    implementing agency but at the same time this could not be effectively highlighted and
    focused on the part of the Bank as well. Had there been an effective M&E mechanism in
    place right from the start, then many deviations from the original implementation plan could
    have been avoided. This unit had to keep the project on track while monitoring the
    implementation plan and introduction of corrective measure as and when those were required.


Bank’s supervision technical and operational skills mix:

54. It has been highlighted in the report that supervision/TA missions identified proper
    implementation bottlenecks and provided detailed action plans in Aide Memoires/ Technical
    Reports to address them (See para 43). It has also been pointed out that during most of project
    life, the quality of Bank‟s supervision suffered on account of lack of coordination between
    the TA team and the task team. It may not be proper to doubt the technical knowledge and
    expertise of the TA team members but perhaps some of them were not fully conversant with
    the local operational, legal, economic and political environment, therefore, their technical
    advices could not yield the desired results rather at times those were found counter-
    productive. Following can be quoted as examples:-

55. An agreement was signed between the World Bank and FBR on Tax Administration Reforms
    on July 10, 2009 (see Appendix I – Follow up on Tax Administration Reform July 2009).
    This agreement vide para 8 prescribed certain timelines for creation of new occupational
    group with necessary changes in laws and rules, etc. It was required under this agreement


                                                65
   that Revenue Division will move the Establishment Division to prepare a proposal for the
   creation of two new occupational groups. The staff had to be given a two week period to
   decide whether to be transferred to a new occupational group. As cited, agreement was
   signed on July 10 and all related actions were mandated to be completed by September 30,
   2009. This timeline was followed and the outcomes of these decisions have elaborately been
   highlighted in ICR at paras 14, 18, 19, 36, 37 and 51. Before going for a major structural
   decision for creation of a new occupational group, it was required to undertake detailed
   discussions with all stakeholders to address their perceptions or concerns about new
   arrangement. GOP had introduced occupation groups in 1973 and to make any structural
   change within 15 days and that too without addressing concerns of the concerned, its outcome
   could well be imagined. This decision had far reaching implications for the staff who had put
   in decades of service. In country like Pakistan, there is a different culture attached to
   permanence in job and any change in already laid down terms and conditions or withdrawal
   thereof is prone to be counter-productive. At the moment, scores of litigation are pending at
   different forums filed both by Customs and IR officials relating to different service matters.
   Customs has ended up with surplus officers. Presently, total sanctioned cadre strength of
   Pakistan Customs from BS-17 - 22 is 379 and against this, working strength is 472. This
   situation is leading to a kind of stalemate in the promotion prospects and de-motivated
   workforce which is not only counter- productive rather contrary and detrimental to reforms
   with inherent potential disruptions. This shows the level of over-crowding and administrative
   problems for the organization. FBR management is doing its best to address these
   administrative issues but there are hardly any short cuts and workable quick solutions.

56. Customs reforms were integral part of this project. There was no customs expert in TA team.
    An amount of US$ 28 million was earmarked for IT side of customs reforms. In 2007, FBR
    had floated an idea of doing customs reforms on Public Private Partnership (PPP) basis
    instead of planned under the project. This was the time where a forceful, correct and
    productive advice was required for the organization from customs expert in TA whether PPP
    was workable or not. There was no mention of any best practice in the world where customs
    was being run on PPP basis. The TA team simply agreed to the proposal/decision of FBR
    and reported in the Aide Memoire of Mid Term Review: August 20 – September 13, 2007
    that in view of the PPP approach being adopted by CBR (now FBR) for Computerized
    Customs System, the funds earmarked should be surrendered by CBR. This deviation from
    the strategic objectives resulted in non-realization of reform objectives envisaged for
    Customs. Due to lack of focus on customs reforms, not only the strategic objectives were not
    achieved, the workforce of customs suffered badly because of lack of focus on their HR
    issues. Now, it has been proved that FBR‟s PPP approach for customs was not a viable
    venture which ended in void. The benefit from the available financial resources could not be
    availed which were surrendered to the Bank and simultaneously lot of precious time was
    wasted. Practically, reforms in customs have fallen back by many years.

57. TARP was a `program‟ under `program and project management‟ definition. Different
    activities under this program had to be done under project management methodology. TA
    team members, though experts in their own fields, were not well versed with the requirements
    of program and project management. Whenever, new proposals / advices were rendered
    which had important structural impacts, were not based upon program and project
    management methodologies. For example, when it was advised to go for creation of a new
    service group, then the underlying risk factors were not identified and likewise required
    mitigating measures were neither identified nor put in place. Almost same was the case when
    customs reforms were agreed to be run on PPP basis. Procurement of certain training related
    sub-activities were also delayed in absence of clarity during discussions of TA members with


                                              66
    the concerned officials of the Board. It will always be useful if procurement expert remains
    part of the discussions which involve any types of procurement being discussed with the TA
    team.

58. TA team had advised to go for complete redrafted VAT law, though, other proposals were
    also offered during discussions. Lot of resources and energies were invested. A new
    redrafted law was submitted before the Parliament but that could not be approved. The TA
    team vide `Follow up on Tax Administration Reform – October, 2009‟ had suggested an
    alternate option for approval of set of legal instruments, that instead of sending the package
    of legal reforms to Parliament which may subject it to changes with undesirable
    consequences an `Ordinance‟ may be submitted for President‟s signatures and enforcement.
    This advice was negatively flashed by the local media. Title of one such press clipping on
    referred to suggestion of the TA team is quoted, “Bypass Parliament, World Bank advises
    Government of Pakistan?. This type of approach made the job of FBR/GOP more difficult
    for getting the law approved by the competent forum/authority.

59. At certain times, TA team adopted top-down approach while rendering advice on different
    issues which when subsequently came up for implementation then those were not found
    doable. In reform related activities, where no policy decision is required, then bottom-up
    approach through discussions and agreements with the concerned functionaries will be more
    meaningful and result oriented (See para 3.2 of PCR).

Government’s performance:

60. Government‟s performance rating has been determined in the report as `unsatisfactory‟ and
    rationale for this finding is explained at paras 45 – 47. Government‟s commitment to Tax
    Policy Reforms could not bring intended results due to multiple vulnerabilities. There were
    changes at top leadership level but most of these changes had resulted due to retirement of the
    officials after completing the prescribed tenure of service. During this time period there were
    four Chairman FBR. Three of them had retired after completion of their service tenure i.e. 60
    years. Besides this, out of eight PDs, four had again either retired or contract duration had
    ended. After promulgation of FBR Act 2007, CCFR was replaced with the Board-in-Council
    consisting of Members of FBR. Thus, meeting of CCFR after constitution of Board-in-
    Council was not required. Chairman FBR has regularly been convening meetings of the
    Board-in-Council to take important decisions. In the draft report, it has been highlighted that
    GOP had committed for increase in tax revenue through introduction of broad based value
    added tax (VAT) or reformed general sales tax (RGST), etc. but the GOP was unable to
    secure political consensus on the passage of the proposed VAT or RGST bill by the TARP
    closing date. Concerted efforts rendered by the GOP for introduction of VAT/RGST are
    needed to be acknowledged which is missing in the report. Lot of efforts were invested for
    drafting of VAT/RGST law. An international conference was convened in Islamabad in
    2009, and later on, two workshops were convened in Dubai, UAE where international experts
    in the field had also participated for assistance in drafting the law. After doing lot of work,
    draft law, after clearance by the Ministry of Law, was submitted before the Parliament for
    consideration and approval. Here again, numerous meetings were held at Parliamentary
    Committees level where GOP officials appeared and made all out efforts to convince the
    parliamentarians for approving it. Despite all these sincere efforts stretched over many
    months, the Parliament did not approve the law. To say, the Government was unable to
    secure political consensus for approval of the law may not be a fair comment. Government is
    subservient to the Parliament and if any law, in its wisdom is not approvable then the
    Government cannot be blamed for this happening because sovereign decision of the people‟s


                                                67
    representatives has to be respected by all, including the Government. With this explanation,
    rating of the Government performance needs to be upgraded to `moderately satisfactory‟
    rather than „moderately unsatisfactory‟.

Implementing agency’s performance:

61. In the report, implementing agency‟s performance has been rated as „moderately
    unsatisfactory‟. Justification for this rating has been summarized at paras 48 – 49. Both
    positive as well as negative outcomes have been focused. It has been highlighted that positive
    outcomes include completion of several physical and IT infrastructure related sub-projects at
    several locations across Pakistan, etc. This is to be highlighted that not several rather all
    procurement related activities consisting of ICT hardware/software, refurbishment of existing
    infrastructure, construction of Transit Accommodations were completed with exception of
    only two activities; (i) TFC Guru Mandir –litigation issue, and (ii) FBR Call Center. Hence,
    there could be no better performance than this one. FBR recognizes that certain suggestions
    of the Bank could not be implemented as per given timelines but most of the
    recommendations were followed and implemented. Position relating to indecision on IT
    strategy as discussed in para 49 has already been discussed in these comments. Instead of
    indecision, there were certain factors which were beyond the control of both FBR and the
    World Bank and ultimately it had to be reconciled with the situation. It was not in the domain
    of the FBR to provide security of tenure to the leadership because as explained at preceding
    paras, if an official had attained the age limit prescribed for retirement then that had to be
    followed. This has happened in many cases. There were many policy related decisions which
    had to be taken by the Government and FBR could only provide its input. Example includes
    the creation of consensus with the Provincial Governments for levy of VAT/ Sales Tax on
    Services after passage of 18th Constitutional Amendment. FBR‟s efforts were there but at
    times those could not yield the intended results due to inherent limitations. While taking into
    account overall level of efforts made by the implementing agency for undertaking these
    reforms in an environment which was saddled with many vulnerabilities, the rating should
    not be less than „satisfactory‟.

Lessons learned:

62. Lessons learned during implementation of TARP have been summarized at para 51 of the
    report. FBR had also identified lessons learned during implementation of this program which
    are shown at Annex-7 to the draft ICR. Another lesson has also been learned during this
    process that composition of the TA team is very important. A TA team having complete
    professional competence, receptive in approach, accommodative to workable views and with
    a problem solving approach can be more productive and supportive to the project. In the TA
    team for TARP, professional competence of IT expert was par excellent, likewise, there was
    no doubt about the competence of the HRM expert. Other experts of TA team who had to
    address VAT/RGST drafting and implementation, etc., or making changes /amendments in
    rules/regulations or administrative laws were required to be fully aware of the local
    dynamics. For complete success of a program/project, it will be more appropriate that before
    making selection of a TA team member his/her extensive knowledge of that
    country/environment is evaluated objectively. An example can be cited from the TARP
    procurement scenario where problem solving approach was overly visible. There were
    difficult and complex procurements. Most of the procurement processes were started during
    2005 – 2009 but could not succeed due to multiple reasons. There were delays both on the
    part of the implementing agency as well as delays in response from the Bank‟s side. After
    TARP restructuring, both the teams i.e. TARP (PMU) and the Bank‟s TTL team sat together


                                                68
    and devised a strategy for a way forward. Both the teams landed on the same page and
    remained there till completion of the job. Bank‟s TTL team was found to be highly receptive,
    accommodative to any workable and convincing proposal and the TARP (PMU) team has
    always been addressing the observations /suggestions made from the Bank‟s side. There were
    lot of meetings, face to face discussions as well as extensive telephonic discussions on the
    issues and both the teams agreed to implementable methodologies. All types of differences
    were sorted out in productive manners. The end result was that all procurements enlisted in
    TARP PC-I were completed in totality with exception of only two. To say the least, problem
    solving approach and clarity in objectives while staying on the same page gave the dividend.

63. In Annex 2(B) Intermediate Outcome Indicators, under the “Project Outcomes? heading it has
    been stated that 5,000 mid level officers were to be trained annually. As against this 2,150
    were trained so the target was not achieved. This statement needs correction. A total of 2,200
    officers were trained in 2011 under different training activities undertaken through
    procurement and 494 officers were sent on short courses abroad on regularly offered courses
    in universities/institutions abroad. Thus, a total of 2,694 officers were trained. Further the
    number of officers to be trained was reduced after consultation with the Bank, with the
    purpose of substantial improvement in focus on technical and IT areas and to avoid disrupting
    revenue collection efforts.

64. In the same annexure under Organization and Management for Efficiency it has been
    mentioned regarding upgrading of human resource policies and management under the
    column “not achieved? that implementation of several aspects of policy paper is still
    incomplete and some components have not evolved as desired. The spade work at level of
    HRM in all areas of HRM policy has been done and solid proposals and concept papers with
    complete working have been submitted for final approvals of the competent authorities so
    nothing is pending at HRM Wing‟s end.

65. In Annex-2(B), it has been shown against the output „Action Plan to strengthen the appeals
    function implement‟ that no information was available by end of the Project. The Legal Wing
    of the Board has explained that at the 1st Appellate Stage, time period to decide the appeal is
    120 days. However, in most of the cases, these appeals are decided within 60 days.
    Reasonable time has been provided in the statutes to facilitate taxpayers and to improve
    fairness and transparency in the resolution of appeals.

66. In Annex 2(D), it has been pointed out against the original component „strengthening revenue
    services – voluntary and enforce collection appeals and dispute resolution to carry out
    workflow review and automation of the appeals/dispute processes. The Legal Wing of the
    Board has explained the related position that at present, at 1st appellate stage Appeal
    Management and Processing System is in place and operational and similar kind of system
    needs to be implemented at the stage of both the Appellate Tribunals of Inland Revenue and
    Customs to enhance the collaboration and better representation of appeal cases.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Summary of DFID‟s PCR:

TARP has made significant progress in some areas, but the nature of shortcomings limit the
effectiveness to achieve final outcomes. Major achievements include the reorganization of the
Federal Bureau of Revenues (FBR) into an integrated functional organization, the reactivation of
tax audits based on a risk-management system, improvement in enforcement and the Integrated
Tax Management System (ITMS) developed by FBR and PRAL which is now available to field
formations.

Project‟s implementation shortcomings have a common characteristic: the continuation of
discretionary procedures at FBR. Delays in the rolling out of the ITMS, staff training on its use,
reorganization at zonal level which weakens monitoring of the audit at the field level, contributed
to the continuation of traditional methods for tax assessment, collection, audit and enforcement.
In retrospect, it seems the donors were the most enthusiastic supporters of TARP although the
benefits are clearly of national nature. It is understandable that the implementation of a reform
where accountability is poor and there is no culture to pay taxes, there would be resistance to
make tax administration more efficient and effective.

A key question for DFID is whether it should have been prepared to walk away. This is a difficult
call. The enabling environment for this project deteriorated in its last two years as the political
and macroeconomic context evolved. And yet, much of the progress achieved by TARP occurred
during the last two years after project extension. This underscores the importance of DFID
maintaining a thorough understanding of the political context when engaging in institutional
reform projects like TARP. The analysis should be regularly updated as the project progresses,
and DFID should stay actively engaged in maintaining its investments, tracking progress, and
maintaining a policy dialogue on issues affecting implementation.

DFID‟s contributions to developing FBR‟s IT systems have been critical. The effectiveness of the
development and availability of ITMS throughout FBR has been reduced by delays in the training
of staff to use the system pending validation from the Core Business Domain Team (CBDT) and
PRAL. The effectiveness of the development and availability of ITMS throughout FBR has been
reduced by delays in the training of staff, with the result that field formations are using informal
mechanisms to learn the new system. Although the use of IT is pivotal to many components of
TARP, the use of ITMS is still not universal in FBR seven years into the reforms. The reluctance
to fully operationalize ITMS could also reflect the unfamiliarity of senior management with the
IT system.

Potential benefits could include higher government revenues for years to come which, if well
targeted, could support poverty eradication programs many times over through multiplier effects.
But while all the key building blocks are in place, shortcomings in implementation, which still
leave scope for discretion, mean these benefits are not yet secured. The value for money of
DFID‟s contribution may prove to be substantial if the outstanding steps are completed swiftly by
the government, but this remains in doubt. Renewed support to tax administration reform would
help maintain momentum to complete the remaining components, especially as internal resistance
continues and the government‟s attention is distracted by impending elections. Donors should
stay engaged in this crucial policy area.
DFID largely tracked TARP through World Bank missions, and its engagement with FBR was
limited in between. Management of TARP also changed hands within DFID several times during



                                                70
the last few years of the programme, reducing the quality and consistency of DFID‟s oversight
and leaving DFID a little over-reliant on the World Bank policy analysis. Given the ambition of
the programme, and the challenging context, a more active policy engagement from DFID may
have been helpful, particularly as the World Bank was unable to deliver an Islamabad-based
staffer to manage TARP. However, this would have an investment of significant more DFID staff
time, impacting other work areas.

Further donor support is likely to be critical to completing the parts which are institutionally and
politically most difficult and where resistance is still tangible. Time is of the essence; the reform
efforts will come to naught if the remaining essential components are not completed soon.
Already major reversals have taken place; without further donor support (training or technical
assistance) the whole process can be setback fatally.

The main benefits of TARP so far are not the hardware but the gradual built-up of momentum for
change. If support for the TARP does not continue, the non-tangible benefits will not take long to
evaporate. The lack of government focus on this vital reform, vital not just for better governance,
but for revenues to stabilize the economy, reduce inflation, and finance a large development
agenda, makes a strong case for donors to continue support for an important neglected reform.
