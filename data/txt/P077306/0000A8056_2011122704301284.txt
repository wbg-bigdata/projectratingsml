                         FBR maintained progress against some key intermediate performance indicators. Positive results in FY 11 included: (i) registered and active taxpayers increased by 6.2% from 2.984
                         million to 3.167 million; (ii) electronic return filers increased by 6% for sales tax, with income tax filers registering a 27% increase in FY 10 (FY 11 returns have yet to be filed); and (iii)
                         registered and active taxpayers for income tax and sales tax (e-enrolled, liable to file) increased by 29% and 13%, respectively. Further, IDA and DFID financing under TARP
                         continued to facilitate improvements in FBR's physical and IT related infrastructure. In this context, the PMU's significant efforts in completing/finalizing procurements of about US$

                         21.5 million in last about 12 months are commendable.

                         Notwithstanding the above positive trends, TARP implementation lags behind the intended achievements against the PDO. Areas of concern relate to: (i) Net revenue collection in FY
                         11 (Rs. 1,550 billion, based on provisional figures) was below the post floods and revised revenue target of Rs. 1,588 billion; (ii) Net revenue collection as percent of GDP fell to 8.6%
                         compared to 9.0 percent in FY 10, further deteriorating Pakistan's weak fiscal stance; and (iii) Modernized FBR organizational structure fully functional by end of project is facing
                         critical challenges on account of inter alia: possible adverse impact of the organizational changes, introduced in February 2011, on FBR's effectiveness and accountability goals
                         originally pursued by the Government's endorsed organizational model along functional lines; lack of an appropriate coordination mechanism to oversee operations between
                         headquarters and field formations; and an unstable tenure at mid-management levels undermining the efficiency and effectiveness of FBR to implement its reform action plan. Action
                         on priority administrative measures (PAM) agreed with FBR during the coming months can enhance tax compliance and improve revenue collection in the short and mid terms.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Once project➢? s implementation is completed by December 31, 2011, the Bank is required by operation procedures to complete the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) by
                         June, 2012. The ICR will be submitted to the World Bank➢? s Board. The main objective of this report is to assess TARP➢? s achievements and shortcomings as to derive useful
                         lessons for further tax administration reforms and World Bank support to these. With the agreement of FBR authorities, the Bank will field an ICR mission early in 2012.
