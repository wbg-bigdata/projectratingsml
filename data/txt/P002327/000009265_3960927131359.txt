MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE ?RESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
FOR A SECOND SMALL RURAL OPERATIONS PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Senegal for SDR 12 million
(USS 16.1 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed
credit would be on standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity, and would
help finance a second small rural operations project. The project would be
cofinanced by IFAD for about SDR 3.7*7million (US$ 5 million equivalent).
2.       Background. Three quarters of Senegal's territory lies in the
Sahel, which suffers from low rainfall and periodic droughts. Yet, 702 of
the population depend for employment and income on the rural sector, making
it the principal livelihood for most Senegalese. Despite efforts at
modernization, agriculture continues to stagnate and, aside from climate,
the main constraints include: (i) the limited scope for diversification;
(ii) the lack of a well-functioning capital market and credit system; (iii)
the low productivity of large-scale public investments; (iv) the weak
institutional environment for project identification and implementation;
and (v) the weak organizational structures at farm level.
3.       Government's long-term strategy aims at increasing the
profitability of agriculture. Realizing that the development of both
rainfed and irrigated agriculture at reasonable cost can be done only by
transforming rural institutions and giving greater responsibility to
farmers, this strategy focuses mainly on: (a) the generation and transfer
of adequate technology; Cb) the strengthening of rural institutions; (c)
the improvement of the economic incentive environment; (d) sustainable
natural resource management; and (e) the recapitalization of the rural
economy. Government and the Bank Group are pursuing this strategy within
ongoing projects and Structural Adjustment Operations.
4.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Bank's rural sector strategy
for Senegal is in full agreement with the Government's priorities
concerning rural development and growth in agricultural production. In
accordance with the New Agricultural Policy, and through its continued
involvement in small rural operations, the Bank seeks to support the
Government's quest for less costly government interventions, greater
private initiative, and a more balanced mix of private and public
institutions in the rural sector. By continuing efforts begun under the
first Small Rural Operations Project (Cr. 991-SE), it is hoped that this
second project will eventually create new institutions (especially
farmers' groups, but also small contractors) that have a solid foundation
in rural communities and do not require for their survival a continuous
infusion of outside money and skills. A number of non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) are involved with small rural operations in Senegal,



-2-
often with differing approaches. IDA's involvement is also crucial in
order to bring about the gradual harmonization of the procedures of these
NGOs, which are under the supervision of the same Ministry as the project,
and to involve them as much as possible in field-level implementation.
S.       Experience from the first-phase Project has demonstrated that
small rural operations (fruit and vegetable perimeters, beekeeping, etc.)
provide an important source of cash income for a significant number of
rural inhabitants. Overall performance has been satisfactory, and results,
in terms of the number of activities financed and the area covered, have
surpassed appraisal targets. Much interest has been generated by the
component that was added to support subprojects "to be identified in the
course of implementation".
6.       One of the innovative features of the first phase project was the
Capital Replacement Account (CRA) which asked farmer groups to open a
blocked account in their name, the funds from which would be used to
replace medium-term assets at the end of their useful life. Results in the
initial stages were mixed in terms of farmer acceptance and contribution to
the CRAs. Despite this initial reluctance to constitute the the concept
has now been accepted by the groups. Except for the fishing subproject,
all other subprojects have enough funds in their CRAs to permit at least
partial replacement of their medium-term assets. Groups have in general now
paid into their CRAs an average of about 60 2 of the theoretical amounts
they were expected to pay. Producers seem to have understood the need to
save to replace assets in the future, and are expected to continue
contributing to their CRAs. This aspect of the first phase will continue
to be supervised to ensure that subprojects financed under the first
Project become self-sustaining. The proposed project emphasises farmers'
commitment to the CRA concept by asking for a higher initial producer
payment into their account of at least 10 X of the installed cost of
medium-term assets compared to 52 in the first phase project.
7.       Apart from the initial problems with the CRA the other main
problems encountered under the first phase project weres (i) the poor
quality of construction; (ii) lack of clarity on the respective roles of
the Project Management Unit and some implementing agencies; and        Ciii)
inadequate provisions for the maintenance of developed perimeters. The
main difficulty was that most executing agencies considered the project, at
least initially, to be peripheral to their main activities. The selection
and appraisal process of the proposed project has incorporated these
lessons learned under the first project. Executing agencies for appraised
operations have been closely involved in the preparation and appraisal of
subprojects assigned to them. Contracts linking the Project Management
Unit and the agencies would spell out: (a) supervision responsibilities
during both construction and project execution; (b) inputs expected from
the agencies in procurement; and   (c) departments within the agencies
responsible for subproject implementation. The proposed project has also
introduced the notion of maintenance accounts that farmers are to set up to
repair and maintain shared facilities. Training on farmer responsibilities
and on correct use of assets would also be an integral part of the project.



-3-
8.       Project Obiectives.  The broad objectives of this project remain
the same as under the first project, namely: (i) to foster productive
small-scale investments in the rural sector through local initiative and
participation; (ii) to introduce producer groups to new technology and
render them creditworthy in the judgement of the local banking system; and
(iii) to reinforce the Senegalese capacity for identification and
preparation of small rural projects. A special effort is to be made under
the project to train and assist producer groups in becoming more
independent and creditworthy and to involve NGOs as executing agencies for
sub-projects. The latter would be an experiment in combining
systematically the resources of the public sector on the one hand, withb the
skills and local knowledge of NGOs in Senegal on the other.
9.       Project Description.  The project, to be implemented over five
years, focuses on channeling funds and technical services to small groups
of rural people who will undertake to provide labor and some funds for the
development of several types of directly productive activities. Eight
subprojects have so far been appraised, namelys rehabilitation of rice
perimeters developed under the first-phase project (Ngalenka); development
of new irrigated rice perimeters near Ngalenka; development of rice and
vegetable perimeters near Matam for women's groups; rice and vegetable
perimeters near Bakel; vegetable and fruitcrop production (Sirmang); a
fruitcrop, rice and banana perimeter (Fass); one beekeeping subproject
(Kolda); and development of a banana perimeter (Diendd). There is a
provision for subprojects to be identified and prepared during
implementation, of which about 302 would be earmarked for activities
directly implemented by women's groups. The project also provides for the
operation of the Project Management Unit, which is located within the
Ministry of Social Development and would collaborate closely with field-
level executing agencies, as well as for monitoring and evaluating the
impact of both the first phase project and the proposed second phase.
Funds would be included under this component for the training of producer
groups and for management assistance to them, with special emphasis on
women's groups.
10.      Total project cost is estimated at US$ 26.1 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US $ 14.2 million, or 55Z. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank group operations in Senegal are presented in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map showing project location is
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7490-SE dated February 6, 1989 is
being distributed separately.
11.      Agreed Actions.  It has been agreed with Government that project
management would remain within the Ministry of Social Development. It is
also agreed that the concept of the Capital Replacement Account (CRA) would
be maintained and that first-year agricultural inputs would be considered
as capital expenditures to be financed under this second phase project.
During appraisal and negotiations, agreements were reached on the operation
of the CRAs, especially on the higher initial contribution to be made by



-4-
producer groups and regular contributions to the accounts. The groups
would also be required to obtain from their members repayments for first-
year inputs, to establish a revolving fund for inputs, and to open accounts
for the maintenance of their assets. In order to ensure sustainability of
the operations under both the first phase and the proposed project,
agreement was reached with Sovernment that if any CRA accounts under both
project phases remained in arrears, the Interministerial Committee, to be
set up for supervising the project, would issue the necessary instructions
for taking appropriate action including seizure of equipment. Agreements
were also reached ont earmarking funds for omen's groups (30Z of the
allocation for unidentified activities); and economic, financial and other
criteria for selecting projects to be financed from the allocation for
unidentified activities.
12.      Benefits.  The project's directly productive activities are
expected to benefit over 4,500 families and create rural employment.
Another important benefit, however, will be the strengthening of an
institutional framework to encourage and support local initiatives, and to
render groups of producers creditworthy. The project will also introduce
an additional revenue-earning activity to rural households. For the
identified subprojects, estimated ERRs range from 12 to 34 percent.
13.      Risks.  Experience under the first phase project and from similar
projects elsewhere suggests that the main risks would concern the quality
of construction works on the perimeters, the lukewarm attitude of the
executing agencies towards assuring beneficiary participation and
initiative, and the beneficiaries' reluctance to set aside funds needed to
replace renewable assets. Executing agencies have been more extensively
involved in project preparation and appraisal and detailed procedures
established between project management and agencies to ensure a more active
participation of the agencies in supervising construction and
implementation. In addition, most groups being included in the project are
recognized legal entities or are in the process of constituting themselves
into legal entities. They have also explicitly asked for project
assistance and hence are expected to be fairly well motivated.
14.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit complies
with the articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Ecexutive Directors approve the proposed credit.
