3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3,1 Original Objective:
The project was the successor to the Small Rural Operations Project (Cr. 991-SE), which was
approved on March 11, 1980 and closed on December 31, 1987. The project's broad objectives were to
encourage local initiative and thereby broaden popular participation in decision-making on rural
investments, and to undertake only those small rural projects that are manifestly in the interest of the
beneficiaries. Within this framework, the project would encourage small groups of producers to constitute
themselves into legally recognized units such as Economic Interest Groups and render these creditworthy in
the judgment of the local banking system; create employment in rural areas to help decrease rural-urban
migration; and strengthen the existing Senegalese capacity for identification and preparation of small rural
projects. The specific projects to be financed would increase crop, fruit and vegetable production, enhance
security of production and raise rural living standards.
The project was a standard second generation project with no particular innovations. The objectives
were in line with Government's policy at the time, which accorded high priority to private sector
development, the development of farmer's organizations, and a retrenchment of Government's role. The
Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) states that the implementation experience under the predecessor project was
incorporated in the design of this project (clearer delineation of responsibilities between project and
executing agencies and a higher beneficiary contribution and participation in the decision process).
Implementation experience showed, however, that major problems identified under the first operation --
poor technical designs and poor supervision by executing agencies -- were not adequately addressed. In
addition, it is unclear to what extent beneficiaries participated in the selection and design of the subprojects.
Indeed, several of these subprojects involved the rehabilitation of development initiatives that had failed
previously, or were based on unrealistic project appraisals, as noted by subsequent supervision missions.
The project's total cost was estimated at US$26.1 million, with IDA contributing US$16.1 million,
IFAD US$5.1 million, the Government US$3.0 million and beneficiaries US$1.9 million. The project was
to benefit about 4,500 farm families at an average cost of US$5,800 per family/US$500 per household
member (including project overheads). Given the low expected rate of return of the subprojects (16%,
excluding overheads) and the high sensitivity of this rate to changes in benefits or costs, it raises the
question whether the project as appraised was an optimal use of scarce resources. This question is not
addressed in the SAR.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The project's objectives and rationale were judged to be still pertinent at the time of the project's
mid-term review (MTR) in 1992, and again in 1996 when it was restructured after a five year suspension in
disbursements (1992-97) due to financial management issues.
3.3 Original Components:
The project, which was to be implemented over five years had the following components:
*   consolidation and rehabilitation of 12 of the 28 irrigated rice and vegetable perimeters
developed under the first Small Rural Operations Project in the Saint Louis region;
*   construction, equipment and technical services for 10 rice and vegetable perimeters of 30 ha
each in the zone lying between the Ngalenka and Senegal rivers in the Saint Louis region;
*   construction, equipment and technical services for four rice and vegetable perimeters of 20-30
ha each in the Matam area for four women's and youth groups;
*   construction, equipment and technical services for six perimeters (rice, maize, sorghum and
-2 -



vegetables) of 30 ha each in the Bakel area of the Tambacounda region;
*   construction, equipment and technical services for a 15 ha vegetable perimeter and a 45 ha
fruit tree operation for 100 families at Sirmang (Lower Saloum region);
*  construction, equipment and technical services for two perimeters of 60 ha each for rice,
maize, banana and citrus fruit, at Fas near Medina-Gounass (Kolda region);
*   individual and collective equipment and technical services for 150 traditional beekeepers in
three villages in the Kolda region;
*   construction, equipment and technical services for 2 banana perimeters of 15 ha each in Diende
(near Sedhiou);
* unidentified sub-projects/activities; and
* improvement of the project management structure with the required technical and
administrative staff and logistical support, including improvement of project accounting,
monitoring and evaluation and links between the project directors and the sub-projects.
3.4 Revised Components:
The project underwent a dramatic change as a result of its restructuring. Project management was
transferred from the Government to a newly constituted non-governmental association, with close ties to
producer organizations: the newly created Senegalese Association for the Promotion of Small Rural
Development Projects (ASPRODEB - Association Senegalaise pour la promotion des petits projets de
DOveloppement de Base), a Non-Govermmental Organization. This is a confederation of 13 producer
organizations and committees that represent most areas of village-level economic activity in Senegal. The
new set-up ensured a much more participatory approach than was possible under the previous structure.In
addition ,this participatory process contributed in empowering the agricultural producers' leadership
through Asprodeb/Agep and building trust between the Government and other project stakeholders.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Although project's objectives were sound and in line with Government's overall strategy as elaborated
in 1984, its design was poor. The Board document for the restructured project states that dismal project
performance was caused to a large degree by a lack of clarity in implementation arrangements. The
relationship between the Project Management Unit (PMU) and the supervisory ministry, and between the
PMU and the lnterministerial Steering Committee, was not clearly defined. This opened up the PMU to
interference in its mandate and operating procedures by the frequently changing supervising ministry. To a
certain extent the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) mission concurs with this assessment. The
project basically adapted a model that had worked reasonably well for the predecessor project. The design
team at the time had therefore no reason to drastically change that model given the information available to
it at the time. The appraisal team omitted, however, the details for the implementation arrangements
between the PMU and the executing agencies. The SAR merely mentions that certain clarifications need to
be made, but fails to come up with a standardized terms of reference. As a result, the issue of poor civil
works resulting from inadequate supervision also re-emerged. Project management costs were high relative
to overall project costs (US$6.0 million for project management or 37 percent of estimated project costs).
The new organizational set-up with ASPRODEP was sound and properly assessed. ASPRODEB with
its roots in rural communities in Senegal was much better placed to put in motion the participatory process
initially envisaged. Management costs remained, however, high relative to investments in part because of
the set-up of the executing branch of ASPRODEB (Project Executing Agency or AGEP), which had 25
staff responsible for project implementation (16 in Dakar and 9 in 3 regional offices, most of them
non-technical staff). An important issue facing the project was that project redesign had taken almost four
years and the Bank was reluctant to change the closing date. The original closing date of June 30, 1998
was thus maintained in the revised legal document, even though the suspension of disbursement was not
- 3 -



lifted until February 18, 1997. This led to difficulties in the identification of a pipeline of new sub-projects
by the implementing agency and thus a low output relative to capacity/overhead costs. It also created
problems with the implementation of already identified projects, because they all had to be completed by
June 30, 1998. Two extensions were approved by the Bank. The first by one year to June 30, 1999. The
second by six months until December 31, 2000. In each instance the extension was not approved until late.
The issue of poor subproject supervision was partially addressed by relying more on beneficiaries and
project staff. Technical quality did not improve much though, as it was increasingly carried out by smaller
and less experienced construction companies.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Overall, the project's outcome is judged unsatisfactory, in spite of having achieved its the majority of
its identified investment targets and greatly exceeded the estimated number of beneficiaries (from 4,500
families to 10,400 families).
4.2 Outputs by components:
In broad terms, the project achieved its objective of encouraging local initiative and effectively promoting
beneficiaries' participation in the selection and design of agricultural investments. Although the early
subprojects didn't fit this criteria entirely, subprojects became increasingly beneficiary-driven, with
increased participation of beneficiaries in subproject selection and execution. The project was to finance
about 85 pre-identified subprojects as well as a number of yet to be identified subprojects, to benefit about
4,500 farm families or 51,000 people. Overall, the project achieved the majority of its pre-identified
investment targets and greatly exceeded the estimated number of beneficiaries (subprojects benefited about
10,400 farm families or 114,000 people).  The outcome of the subprojects defined in the project's
components are detailed in the tables in Annex 1. The project did fall short of the target for unidentified
sub-projects, reaching only 41 percent of the expected value of total investment cost (no target in terms of
number of subprojects was defined at the time of project appraisal). The shortfall in the investment level
can, however, be explained by the change in the types of subprojects from high-cost medium-sized irrigated
perimeters to smaller subprojects such as small vegetable perimeters and semi-intensive livestock and
product transformation.
Also, even though the suspension and redesign of the project had taken almost four years, with the
suspension of disbursement lifted only in February 1997, the Bank was reluctant to change the project's
original closing date of June 30, 1998. This led to difficulties in developing a pipeline of new sub-projects
by the implementing agency and to a low output relative to capacity/overhead costs. It also created
problems with the completion of several of the already identified projects, stopped during the suspension
period, which had to be completed by June 30, 1998. Eventually, two extensions were nevertheless
approved by the Bank. The first by one year to June 30, 1999. The second by six months until December
31, 2000. However, in each instance the extension was not approved until a few days before the closing
date and this too prevented forward planning of sub-projects.
The quality of the subprojects improved with the increased implication of beneficiary groups and the strong
desire of ASPRODEB to associate with the most active producer groups. ASPRODEB also started to use
local consulting firms to assess the capacities of producer groups. Costs were, however, in many cases
higher than planned because of the long delays between subproject identification and implementation. In
particular, the cost of irrigation works were high, almost twice as expensive as those in neighboring
Mauritania under similar conditions. There is no satisfactory explanation for this large cost differential. In
addition, several subprojects were dropped during project implementation because they were no longer
-4 -



viable, partly because of the long delay between subproject identification and implementation (up to 10
years), but also because of the large size of some of the groups of beneficiaries which made it difficult to
efficiently manage a subproject, and the improper selection of some groups.
4.3 Net Present Value/lEconomic rate of return:
The SAR foresaw the creation of a monitoring and evaluation function at the level of the PMU. This
was, however, not implemented and received little or no emphasis by Bank supervision missions. Reliable
data is therefore not available to repeat the analysis presented in the SAR. Based on the information
gathered during field visits, it is unlikely that the project attained its objective of a 16 percent economic rate
of return. In several cases costs were higher than estimated and benefits much lower or delayed.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
No financial rate of return was presented in the SAR. As the project did not track the production
impact of the subprojects and beneficiaries had not been trained to keep written records to track their own
performance, the impact of the subprojects on production and household incomes is not known. It is
therefore impossible to assess whether the project has been able to achieve the production and income
increases as detailed in the SAR. Given the basic lack of reliable data, the ICR mission could only make a
rough estimate of the subprojects' impact on household incomes. The appraisal estimate called for an
increase in household income by on average US$760. The ICR mission estimates the actual increase
ranges from US$180-450, depending on the type of project. Actual project cost per beneficiary is about
US$190. This information is presented for illustration purposes only as the data was obtained mostly from
beneficiaries' recollections and not from written records.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The institutional impact of the project is moderate. ASPRODEB and its operational arm AGEP, is still
a young, relatively inexperienced organization. ASPRODEB was established in February 1995 to take
over responsibility for PPPR II. Its origins precede the project, however, as its core is the National
Counsel for the Rural Population (CNCR, Conseil National de Concertation des Ruraux), a national lobby
for rural people which had already demonstrated an active commitment to grassroots development. The
CNCR continues to exert a powerful influence on ASPRODEB, as its president is also the president of
ASPRODEB, and CNCR's member organizations account for 9 of the 13 member organizations of
ASPRODEB. The project established and financed the AGEP within the ASPRODEB framework.
Although staffed with well-trained professionals with experience in project management and
implementation, AGEP's real performance has been relatively poor and its costs high, and further efforts
are clearly needed to improve efficiency if it is to generate a real demand for its services and become a
viable and sustainable institution.
At the beneficiary level, capacity building was given insufficient priority until late in the project cycle.
Initially, it mostly focused on technical support for subproject implementation, but often did not tackle
financial, organizational and marketing issues. With the relaunch of the project in 1997, this deficiency
was addressed and about four members of each producer group have since systematically benefited from
such training.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The main factor was the devaluation of the franc CFA in January 1994. This initially greatly reduced
the cost of subprojects in foreign currency equivalent, as they mostly required local expenditures. Inflation
in subsequent years erased most of these cost savings.
- 5 -



5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Project implementation was greatly hampered by the frequent change in supervisory ministry (4
different ministries in 4 years), which each had its seperate sets of demands on the project in terms of
staffing, priorities and equipment needs. These changes caused the PMU to be in a perpetual stated of flux
and unable to fulfill its mandate. Technical supervision of project imnplementation suffered, cooperation
with implementing agencies was far from ideal, with no priorities accorded to the project, and subproject
identification and implementation was not always decided on the merits of the subproject, but also
influenced by political factors. Finally, financial management was weak and the PMU was unable to
account for all the funds used by the project. It was for these reasons that the IDA credit and IFAD loan
were suspended in 1992. It is unclear why the institutional set-up that had worked well under the first
project, failed so miserably under this project.
Government was unable to fulfill all conditions related to the lifting of the suspension of disbursements
until February 1997. This was mostly due to the difficult negotiations between IDA and the Government
on the transfer of project implementation and thus control, from the Government to an independent
association. It is not clear why Government moved so slow and IDA was so patient. After the transfer of
project implementation responsibility to ASPRODEB/AGEP, the Government's role in the project was
substantially reduced and limited to its role in the project steering committee. As a result implementation
performance of the project was improved. Beneficiary participation in selection and execution of projects
increased and there was a marked change in the type of subprojects supported: away from capital intensive
investments in irrigation to smaller and more directly productive investments such as cattle fattening.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The project was in essence implemented by two agencies. Until 1992 by the PMU and after 1997 by
ASPRODEB/AGEP. The PMU was weak, overstaffed and unable to carry out its mandate effectively
because of continued political interference. As mentioned above, financial management and technical
supervision of the suprojects was weak leading to problems related to the quality of the subprojects and its
inability to justify all funds used for the project. It is difficult to seperate the impact of the changes in
supervisory ministry from poor management at the level of the PMU.
With the relaunch of the project in 1997.   ASPRODEB/AGEP implementation performance --
planning, technical supervision and financial management -- was satisfactory. It also undertook to
implicate beneficiaries in subproject design and execution, which had a clearly positive impact on
subproject implementation. AGEP's operating costs were, however, high. Its set-up was too costly for the
level of activities planned (25 staff).
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
Planned and actual costs and financing are detailed in Annex 2. Project costs at appraisal were
estimated at US$26.1 million. Actual project costs are estimated at US$21.45 million. For most
subprojects, actual costs exceeded appraisal estimates by a significant margin, except for Matain and Fass,
and the unidentified subprojects. Subproject costs were higher than estimated because in quite a few cases
there was a substantial delay between identification and implementation and design issues had to be
addressed. It is for this reason that several identified subprojects were dropped after the suspension of
disbursements were lifted in 1997. Project management costs in absolute terms were slightly less than
appraisal estimates (but not as a percentage of total project costs).
The IDA credit was originally equivalent to US$16.10 million. In the end, US$14.68 million were
utilized, in part because of the shortfall in unidentified subprojects, despite increased expenditures on
subprojects that were identified before 1988. The contribution by Government was close to appraisal
- 6 -



estimates according to the Government, this is, however, difficult to verify for the pre-1992 period.
Likewise the contribution by beneficiaries is difficult to estimate. In principle, they have contributed to the
subprojects, but this is difficult to verify ex-post. Supervision missions have underscored this problem on
several occasions. The original IFAD loan was in the amount of US$5.00 million, its actual contribution is
US$3.70 million.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The sustainablity of subproject is also not evident an therefore judged unlikely. In strict financial
terms, few of the operating subprojects appear to be sustainable. Their capacity to generate a significant
return after loan repayment and provision for capital replacement is limited, their ability to withstand
adverse physical and economic conditions is weak. Half of all subprojects have been unable to meet their
loan repayments, and none have managed to maintain their capital replacement accounts as envisaged in the
original project design. Inadequate project training in product marketing and financial management has
further reduced the short and medium-term prospects for financial sustainability. This issue was not
satisfactorily addressed until after the 1997 project restructuring. However, this assessment ignores the
capacity of participants to draw on other sources of income to finance loan repayment and capital
replacement when required. Of the sub-sample of longer running subprojects visited, where the producer
groups had benefited from longer project support, many had been able to replace their capital equipment
when necessary, through recourse to cash contributions by members and use of the available funds in the
capital replacement account. It is therefore imperative that beneficiaries continue to benefit from support
and training for their access to agricultural production, marketing and management activities under the
newly launched Agricultural Services and Producer Organizations Support Program (PSAOP).
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
No specific transition arrangements were made to ensure the continuation of support to beneficiary
groups after the end of the project. Arrangements are, however, being made for support for production and
marketing activities to be provided under the IDA-financed PSAOP. ASPRODEBI/AGEP's future is also
not ensured. ASPRODEB/AGEP has undertaken a management review to improve its efficiency and reduce
the cost of its services. It is currently implementing activities for FAO and it may be involved in the
implementation of certain activities for the PSAOP and the new National Rural Infrastructure Program.

Bank's performance during preparation and appraisal was unsatisfactory. As mentioned in the project
restructuring document, project design had several weaknesses, including the continued poor definition of
relations between different project agencies (inter-ministerial steering committee, PMU and executing
agencies) which created problems during project implementation, and the lack of specificity in the criteria
for selection of sub-projects.
7.2 Supervision:
Bank supervision must also be judged unsatisfactory. Even though supervision missions were adequate in
fiequency, during the first two years of project implementation, they were deficient in terms of skills mix.
The first three missions were staffed by an agricultural economist and IFAD's staff member responsible for
Senegal. It was not until 1991 (and only with IFAD funding) that irrigation and credit specialists
participated. The Bank, although making several recommendations against doing so, was unable to stop the
Government from continuously transferring the PMU from one supervisory Ministry to another (4 times
-7-



between 1998 and 1992), or ministry officials from interfering in subproject selection. Bank missions also
failed to identify financial mismanagement and the deficiencies in subproject design and supervision, and to
take the necessary corrective actions, until the mid-term review (MTR) mission.
Following this MTR in 1992, IDA and IFAD took the right decision and suspended their disbursements.
Agreement was rapidly reached with the Government on the repayment of funds that could not be
accounted for and on the need to drastically change implementation arrangements. However, it took four
years for the Government to fulfill all conditions for lifting the suspension of disbursements, in particular
for effectively putting in place ASPRODEB/AGEP as the new project implementing agency. This does
raise the question why it would not have been simpler to cancel the credit and design a new project that
would properly and comprehensively address the implementation issues raised by the MTR, rather than
trying to fix a large number of design problems.
After the suspension of disbursements was lifted on January 17, 1997, project activities resumed only
slowly, in particular because of the close oversight of the AGEP by the Bank, leading to delays in the
sub-projects approval process (poor quality of proposals and delays in the task manager's response). The
inportance of a monitoring and evaluation system was recognized but not seriously insisted upon. The
decision to transfer responsibility for project supervision to the Resident Mission in Dakar early in 1998
did much to improve communication between Bank and project staff and the review process became more
efficient. Technical field supervision by the Bank was satisfactory. However, no ex-post procurement and
financial audits were conducted as part of regular supervision missions (the Bank had agreed with AGEP to
limit the ex-ante review of the procurement process to subprojects expected to cost more than
US$100,000). The ICR mission conducted the first ex-post procurement review and uncovered a number
of irregularities in procurement that underscored the need to strengthen procurement procedures at the level
of AGEP. Finally, failure to take pro-active action on the extension of the closing date in 1998, even
though it had already been agreed upon, caused funds to dry up for the AGEP and kept the project from
developing new subproject proposals. During the extension period, the project executed only subprojects
identified with the help of FAO under the auspices of its Food Security Project.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Based on the above, the overall performance is given an unsatisfactory rating.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Borrower's performance during preparation was satisfactory although its implication in the preparation
process was limited to general oversight and guidance, the bulk of the project preparation work was done
by consultants, with little direct input by the Borrower as it lacked the capacity to do so.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Govermment's performance during project implementation was unsatisfactory. The change in the PMUs
supervisory ministry four times in a relatively short period of time caused interruptions in implementation
and was costly as each new move required the replacement of equipment and led to poor financial
management practices. In addition, undue political interference led to the selection of below par
subprojects.
The Government, although agreeing in principle to take the measures necessary to take the measures
necessary for lifting disbursements suspension, took four years to actually meet all conditions. In the end,
however, it agreed to transfer project implementation to a non-Governmental agency, which at the time was
a novelty, at least in the case of Senegal. Following the lifting of the suspension of disbursements,
-8 -



Government's role in project implementation was reduced to final oversight through its steering committee.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The performance of the implementing agencies was globally marginally satisfactory. The performance of
the original PMU was clearly highly unsatisfactory. However, although ASPRODEB/AGEP was an
untested concept and was only given a short period of time to come to full maturity, its overall performance
can be rated satisfactory. It succeeded in carrying out a relatively imnportant investment program with
minor technical problems. It greatly improved selection of subprojects and prepared standardized succinct
evaluations and developed a strategy for evaluating beneficiaries' capacity to implement subprojects.
Adherence to procurement procedures was, however, not perfectly respected. Procurement of subprojects
did not always properly follow either the projects implementation manual or the procedures outlined in the
bid documents. Procurement of office supplies and other small items did not follow guidelines and there
was a discrepancy between the (Bank approved) implementation manual and Bank guidelines on local
shopping procedures. The computerized financial management system had limitations that made it
cumbersome to use. The quality of financial management was, however, satisfactory.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
The overall performance of the Borrower was rated unsatisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
The project's poor performance illustrate a number of well-known generic lessons, such as the need to have
a design suitable for local implementation capacities; the need to have the full participation of beneficiaries
in design and implementation; clear responsibilities, accountability and detailed implementation plan from
the start of the project; the critical need to have adequate management, monitoring and reporting system to
ensure efficient implementation and accountability; the critical need, on the Bank side, to have
implementation support missions with the required skill mix. Two important specific lessons can in addition
be highlighted from this operation:
(i) first, that the success of a project, or sub-project, in particular when it depends on mobilizing the interest
and participation of beneficiaries, critically depends on the efficiency and speed of its implementation: the
long delays between identification of some of the sub-projects under this operation not increased their
investment costs, and therefore reduced their financial and economic returns, but also had a demotivating
effect on their beneficiaries;
(ii) secondly, that it is indeed almost always better to close a project with major design flaws and
implementation problems and start anew if there is serious commitment to do so from the government side,
than to try and restructure the operation, if only because of the need of a different mind-set of the
supervisory and implementing agencies/staff.

The column cofinancier under appraisal estimate includes both the contribution by IFAD and that of the project
beneficiaries. Numbers for IFAD do not add up because the fnal financing for all subprojects was not available.
The contribution of the Govement or beneficiaries per subproject is not available. Government has, however made
its full contribution to the project in US$ terms, which is reflected in the financing table. The number for
beneficiaries was estimated.

Annex 3: Economic Costs and Benefits
The SAR (paras. 3.34-3.38) presented an economic analysis based on a farm model. On the basis of
this analysis it estimated the economic rate of return (ERR) for the identified subprojects at 20.4%. The
ERR for the un-identified subprojects was estimated at 16.0%  (the weighted aveage for the identified
subprojects). Attributing 50% of management costs to the subprojects reduced the ERR for all subprojects
(identified and un-identified) to 15.2%.
The ICR mission attempted to estimate project benefits but was stymied in this effort by the lack of
monitoring data collected by the project management unit. Given the absence of this data, it was unable to
verify whether the subprojects had indeed attained the expected returns. Given the much less than expected
outcome of a subsample of projects on household income (at best only 65% of the appraisal estimate), it is
likely that the ERR has also been much less, ceteris paribus.

RESUME DU RAPPORT D'EVALUATION
DE FIN D'EXECUTION DU P.P.R 11
La missioln d'evaluation de fin d'execution dIi Projet a, confonnemient a ses termes de
r6f6rence. procede ai l'analyse:
*  des objectifs globaux et specifiques du projet tels que definis a travers les accords
dic crcdit et de pret (IDA et FIDA) initiaux et arnendes ;
+  des cadres institutionnel/organisationnel mis en place avant la mesure de
suspenision des credits et apres la Ievee totale desdites mesures;
+  (le l'etat d'execution teclinique et financiere;
*  des pcr-foi-riianlces des bailleurs de fond et de l'Emprunteur.
PouL ce faire, la missioni s'est efforcee dans son effort d'analyse, de conjtiuguer 1'etude des
rapports mis a sa disposition avec des visites sur le terrain (regions de Dakar, Thies, Diourbel,
Louga, Saint-Louis, Tambacounda et Kolda).
Lo,  des visites Suir le terrain, Ull accent tout particuliei a el purte sur Ic recueil des
appreciations des beneficiaires (groupements porteurs des sous-projets finances par
1'ASPRODEB/AGEP) et de celles des coordonnateurs.
La missioni a egalement tenu des seances de travail avec le President de l'ASPRODEB, le
President dii Comite de Pilotage de I'AGEP, le Responsable du PPR 11 au niveau de la
Mission Residente de la Banque Mondiale.
L'analyse des constats a permis a la mission de degager les points forts et points faibles de
1'execution dti Projet pouvanit se resumer comme suit:
I-AU TITRE DES POINTS FORTS:
1- la  restructurationi  du  cadre  institutionnel/organisationnel  par  l'avenement  de
I'ASPRODEB et de son Agence d'Execution (AGEP) avec l'instauration d'un systerne de
;,estion de type prive ont contribue A armeliorer le management du Projet et a reinstaurer la
conifiancc des bailleurs du fond ; I'elaboration et l'application du manuel de procedures, la
mise cn place d'ull logiciel de gestion financiere et comptable ont ete, a ne pas en douter,
les facteurs les plus determinants des perfonrances enregistrees par I'AGEP;



2- le controle de la qualite des prestations de service des agences et constiltants contractuels
tant en cc qui concerne P'identification que les etudes de faisabilite et d'execution
lechniiique a, malgre 1'effectif reduit de l'unite teclinique, permis a I'AGEP de faire des
avanc6es significatives dans 1'exercice de sa mission
3- la base de donn6es relatives aux modeles standards de realisation d'infrastructures
affdrentes aux types de sous-projets constitue un acquis precieux au service de
I'ASPRODEB;
4- le noblirbe de sous-projets realises a la date du 31 decembre 1999 (41 aui total) et le
noniibre de beneficiaires touches (pres de 70.000) en six (06) annees d'activites effectives
(1990-1992 ; 1997-1999) sont des illustrations de l'inipact virtuel du Projet stir
l'nmergence d'uLne  nouvelle dynamique de groupements porteurs de projets de
d6veloppement a la base
5- enifiin, le passage ati fil du temps de sous-projets sectoriels a des sous-projets integres
(agriculture/clevage)  constitue  tine  avancee  significative  dans  I'approche  de
l' ASPRODEB/AGEP.
Il-AU TITRE DES POINTS FAIBLES
Points de faiblesse relevant du bailleur
a- ]es ruptuLes de disponibilites financieres constatees au niveau du conmpte special durant
deux (02) periodes cruciales dans l'execution du Projet ( du 25 Mars au 31 Juillet 1998 et
du 22 luillet atl 30 Novembre 1999) pour des raisons de lenteur dans l'exploitation des
Demandes de Remboursement de Fonds (D.R.F);
b- le delai de quatre (04) mois (Janvier a Mai 1997) pris par le bailleur de fond (IDA) pour
approuver les budgets de fonctionnement et d'investissement de I'AGEP au titre de
l'exercie 1997 (annee de redemarrage des activites du PPR II);
c- I'etablissement de conditions de financement (FIDA/IDA) et de participation distinctes
des ben6ficiaircs dans le cadre de la realisation d'un seul et meme projet, oriente vers la
mirne cible a elle enseigne que des difficultes ont ete ressenties ai maints egards pour
llarinioniiser ]es regles d'intervention des bailleurs exterieurs.
Points de faiblesse relevant de t'Emprunteur
a- I'instabilite inslitutionnelle qu'a connu le Projetjusqu'a sa suspension en 1992 (quatre
tranisferts de tLlelle) a constitue un facteur decisif de contre performance, tant dans les
modalites qtue dans les delais d'execution;
b- les mesures de suspension prises par les bailleurs en 1992 ont entrain6 l'intemiption
d'importants travaux relatifs a l'execution de sous-projets, avec comme corollaire la
gen6ration de couts additifs tres significatifs;
c- I'abscnce de suivi sur le terrain des realisations par le Coniit6 de Pilotage qui s'est
unliqtlciient focalise stir t'approbation des budgets et sous-projets.

d- I'absence de synergies entre la Cellule d'Appui Technique du CNCR et l'equipe de
l'AGEP, les relais villageois et le dispositif d'encadrement des groupements porteul-s
de projets ;
e- le faible role joue par le Comite de Surveillance de I'ASPRODEB.
Points de faiblesse relevant de I'AGEP
a- I'inisuffisance et la non diversite des competences en ressources huliiaiines ayant conduit
1'6quipe de I'unite technique (y compris les coordoninateurs) A O cultiver I> la polvvalencc

b- le noni d6veloppement d'unie politique d'information/communicationi at scin de I'AGEP
(marketling des activites);
c- le nono-respect par certaines Entreprises ou Fournisseurs des engagemlienits pris .i travers les
marches ou contrats ayant conduit a la resiliation de certains d'entre euX;
d- la faiblesse des bureaux d'etudes dans certains domaines et ['absence de maitrise de
certains consuttants des methodes d'approche telles que le diagnostic participatif;
e- la formatioii des membres du Conseil d'Administration et des Pr6sidents des Federations
falti6res realis6es tardivement conjuguee avec la non demultiplication des quatre (04)

etant globalemenit positif meme si des ameliorations s'averent souhaitables eu 6gard aux
faiblesses relevees.
Le mecanisne ASPRODEB/AGEP a fait ses preuves meme si le temps qui lui a e  imparti
peut etrejuge comiime etant court (deux ans et demi) pour un montage institUtionnel requerrant
tine longue periode de rodage. II appartient a I'ASPRODEB de se l'approprier en prenant au
besoin, des mesur-es de redimensionniemenit et de redefinition precises des r6les et prerogatives
ct dc la syncigic A rechiercher entre les deux entites motrices que sont la Celitile d'Appui
Teclinique dii CNCR et I'AGEP.
En tout etat de cause, les mutations A operer doivent s'inscrire dans tine dynamique de
rechercihe d'efficacite et de perfonnance tant en ce qui conceme la r6flexion strategique en
Recherclie-D6veloppemenit que P'execution technique et financiere des projets identifies.
L'AGEP ayant capitalise une experience dans le domaine du << faire-faire )> avec dans sa base
de donn6es des modeles standards d'edification d'infrastructures rurales liees aux projets de
developpement A la base, it convient de la perenniser tout en reorientant au besoin sa mission
compte tenu de la mise en cuvre prochaine de certains projets de developpement notamment
ceux attendus de la mi se en aeuvre des plans r6gionaux et locaux de developpement.
La configuration A donier A I'AGEP doit non seulement epouser  les contours de la
d6centralisation mais egalement materialiser la volonte des autorites de l'ASPRODEB de
traduire dans les faits l'option du transfert au niveau de la base de toute la sequence de mise
en azuvi-e des sous-projets portes par ses federations ou OP (identificatioll, etudes de
faisabilit& et d'ex6cution, choix des agences d'appui et des Entrepreneurs).

Cette d6centralisation de I'AGEP devant se materialiser par une organisation (( pyramidale o>
(Direction Generale legere et Coordinations regionales renforcees et plus dynamiques) devrait
ere accompagnee d'une diversification de son portefeuille si tant est que ce creneau doit lui
peimettre de suLvivre.
La diversification du porte-feuille de la nouvelle Agence est de toute evidence assujettie a soIn
savoir-faire ar meme de lui assurer une certaine competitivite. Un appui du Gouvernement
demeure indispensable, ne serait-ce que dans sa volonte de confier a l'Agence l'execution
techlnique et financiere des volets des projets/programmes nationaux negocies avec ses
partenaires aLl Developpement.
En ce qui concerne le porte-feuille de sous-projets, I'ASPRODEB doit s'evertuer a faire en
sorte qu'ils r6pondent a des probl6matiques identifiees a la base et s'assurer que leur
formulation/execution penrnet effectivernent de resoudre les problemes identifies a partir
d'tine d6rmarche de diagnostic participatif tant technique qu'institutionnel.
L'ASPRODEB devra inscrire la formation tant des responsables de ses federations faitieres
que des leaders des OP et des OP elles-memes dans son plan strategique pour le futur. 11
s'agira a travers les actions de formation a developper de creer les conditiolns d'emergence
d'organisatioins de producteurs fortes et arm6es pour gagner la bataille contre la pauvrete.
Une attention toute particuliere devra etre portee sur le renforcement des capacites des
memibres des bureaux des groupements, sur l'elaboration de reglements interieurs adaptes aux
differentes situations et sur l'emergence d'animlateurs villageois relais du dispositif
d'encadrement des futurs conseillers agricoles de l'ANCAR.
Enfin, une r6flexion doit etre engagee par I'ASPRODEB pour:
-  s'ouvrir a d'autres federations (conseil national des produits de cru par exemple)
aFlu d'elargir son champ d'entreprise et sa representativite;
-  d6velopper tin service d'appui aux groupements en matiere de commercialisation
de leurs produits;
-  constitLuer Llle base de donnees de caracterisation des O.P de ses differentes
federations;
-  assurer une durabilite aux differents sous-projets finances en cultivant l'esprit
d'appropriation, d'organisation du travail et de conviction quant a la necessite
d'epargner pour le renouvellement des equipements au fil du temps;
-  developper un systeme densifie de credit de proximite a l'instar de l'experience en
cours dans le departement de Sedhiou a l'initiative du PRIMOCA et du projet
allemaind de Tanaf.
