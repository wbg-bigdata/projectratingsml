I.  THE SECTOR 1/
A.  Introduction
1.01       Project appraisal was undertaken shortly after the recent Government
change. The two-year old Seven-year Development Plan has been suspended and
The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (DRA) is currently re-examining sectoral
policies and investment priorities, including the preparation of a new Five-
year Development Plan which is expected to be finalized during 1979 and which
is expected to give the agricultural sector high priority. The Government has
demonstrated the importance it attaches to agriculture and the alleviation
of rural poverty by passing important Decrees on the alleviation of peasant
indebtedness and fundamental land reform and by acting in a forthright manner
to implement them.
B. Agricultural and Rural Sector
1.02       Role in the Economy.  Afghanistan has an estimated population of
about 14-15 2/ million of which about 85% including about 1.5 million nomads
is rural, and 15% urban.  Agriculture accounts for about 60% of export earn-
ings and employs about 53% of the total labor force estimated at 4.7 million.
From 1968/69 to 1975/76 agricultural production grew at an annual compound
rate of about 1.9%, less than the annual population increase of about 2.2%.
Agriculture's contribution to total GNP in 1975/76 constant prices has dropped
from 65% in 1968/69 to 57% of GNP (1975/76). Whilst this trend of gradual
structural change is consistent with growth patterns in other developing
economies, in Afghanistan it is due largely to sluggish agricultural develop-
ment rather than dynamic growth of other sectors. Consequently, over 6 mil-
lion rural people (about 40% of total population) continue to live in absolute
poverty with a per capita income of about $85 or less.
1.03       Crop Production and Cropping Pattern.  Agriculture is largely
subsistence, with wheat the predominant crop occupying about 70% of total
cereal crop land and some 60% of total cultivated area (4 million ha). Other
crops include maize, barley, and rice, and a wide variety of fruits and
vegetables and industrial crops, including cotton and sugar beet. Average
yields for selected agricultural products compared with "better farmer"
performance are roughly as follows:

listed as Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4, Annex 3, Section A.

Afghanistan is presently pursuing a policy of wheat self-sufficiency as
opposed to 'food security'. 1/ It is virtually wheat self-sufficient in years
of 'normal' precipitation at current per capita consumption levels (155 kg)
and with present population. From 1972/73 to 1976/77 recorded wheat imports
averaged 43,000 tons annually, ranging from 2,500 to 138,000 tons. Crop and
livestock yields have increased very slowly due largely to traditional farming
systems and cultural practices including animal husbandry which, although well
adapted to local conditions have not given way to modern techniques. Although
growth in fertilizer use has been impressive, no more than 15% of the total
cropped area receives fertilizer, with total usage in 1977/78 amounting to
100,000 tons, representing about 26 kg per ha cropped which is very low
compared to neighboring developing countries.
1.04      Until 1978 Government policies had not substantially altered the
skewed income distribution which is strongly influenced by land ownership,
access to credit, support services, and irrigation water availability. The
rural population dispersed among 20,000 viLlages includes an estimated 1.2
million farm families with holdings varying from 0.5 to 6 ha of cultivable
land and averaging about 3.5 ha. Available data suggest that about 80% of
land-owners owned less than 3.9 ha while some 2% held about 40% of total
cultivable land. Perhaps 30 to 40% of land cultivated was farmed by land-
less sharecroppers who probably constitute a high proportion of rural poor.
Equally important is the water rights issue. By tradition, those at the head
of irrigation canals are entitled a water share usually much in excess of
their needs, thus depriving farmers on the lower reaches.
1/   Wheat 'self-sufficiency' implies satisfying national demand, even in poor
years, from local production. 'Food security' would envisage meeting
demand from local production plus storage accumulated in surplus years
and from strategic imports. A Wheat Production Project presently being
appraised would assist Afghanistan to achieve food self-sufficiency.

C. Issues in Agriculture
1.05      Land and Water Utilization.  Afghanistan is a land locked country
with about 85% of the total land area of 65 million hectares unsuitable for
cultivation. Arable land accounts for about 8 million hectares, but due to
water shortage only about 4 million hectares are annually cultivated and of
this only some 2.8 million hectares (70%) are irrigated. The arid, conti-
nental climate poses a major obstacle to agricultural development. Agricul-
tural production relies heavily on irrigation from river flows, snow melts,
springs, karezes 1/ and groundwater. Although rainfed land accounts for
about 37% of total area cultivated, its contribution to total agricultural
crop production is less than 20%. While the potential for increased agricul-
tural production is high, the present inefficient use of water remains a
severe constraint. The issue of water distribution, which has massive social
and economic dimensions, must be faced if Afghanistan is to fully exploit the
latent potential of its land and people. DRA recognizes this and Decree
No. 8 provides a legislative basis for more equitable water distribution by
requiring that in future, water be distributed in accordance with land owned
and crops grown. Implementation however is presently impractical and will
require detailed research and analysis before forward movement can be made.
Furthermore while crop yield per hectare is an important efficiency indicator,
the critical coefficient is yield per water unit used. High priority should
be accorded farm systems research in this field.
1.06      Land Distribution and Tenure.  Rural income and poverty are closely
related to irrigated land ownership. In Ghazni per capita irrigated land is
thought to be about 1.07 jerib 2/ with at least 60% of rural population in
absolute poverty. By comparison, per capita irrigated land in Kunduz is 2.54
jerib with about 20% of rural population living in poverty. The land tenure
system has, in the past, been fundamentally feudal, with distribution skewed
in favor of some 20% of landowners owning about 70% of total irrigated land,
and 60% less than one hectare. Landlord/tenant relationships are tradition-
ally defined in the former's favor. In 1978 DRA introduced Decree No. 8 which
will abolish the skewed land distribution. The Decree places a ceiling of
30 jeribs (6 ha) of first grade irrigated land (orchard and vineyard) with
appropriate adjustments for lower grades, which can be owned by each person.
All land in excess of the prescribed area is confiscated without compensation
and is to be distributed free to landless farmers and 'petty landowners 3/' on
the basis of a maximum of 5 jeribs (1 ha) of 1st grade land each. DRA expects
in excess of 3 million jeribs (600,000 ha) 4/ 1st grade land equivalent to be
1/   An ancient system of tunnels which tap groundwater in mountain fans.
2/   1 Jerib = 0.2 ha.
3/   A 'petty landowner' is a farmer who owns less than 5 jeribs (1 ha) of 1st
grade land.
4/   Landless farmers are to receive not less than 5 jeribs of 1st grade land;
'petty farmers' may receive something less so as to make the area owned
5 jeribs of 1st grade land equivalent.

distributed to about 680,000 'agricultural households', and has proceeded to
speedily implement the law, expecting to complete land distribution by mid
1980. DRA is aware of the need to provide support services (credit, exten-
sion, production inputs) to new settlers, and has taken steps to coordinate
departmental and agency activities and mobilize personnel resources to an
extent never before seen in Afghanistan.  However administrative weaknesses
and the operational capacity of many departments may prove a severe bottle-
neck. Without prompt adequate support to settlers, the bold land reform
program could result initially in lower agricultural production and much
personal hardship. The land issue also includes the rangelands which involves
the nomads and transhumants in a delicately balanced complex of social, eco-
logical, and economic factors; and embraces the fundamental issue which has
so far defied solution, of community ownership and use of land and individual
ownership of livestock.
1.07      Agricultural Extension.  The present ratio of extension agent to
farmers is inadequate, varying between about 1:400 to over 2,000. Total
extension staff number about 3,300 and while the basic extension service
structure exists, its performance has been unsatisfactory. Contributing
factors include cumbersome, highly centralized administrative procedures,
inadequate operating program and training, weak research backup, and poor
staff facilities (housing, transport, equipment) in rural areas. Furthermore,
whilst the extension service contains a number of well trained, qualified and
capable people, these are underutilized to an extent which the country can
ill-afford. Extension and research are separated into different departments
and development and dissemination of new technologies is weak. Coordination
with other agricultural agencies (Agricultural Development Bank of Afghanistan
(AgBank), Afghan Fertilizer Company (AFC)) could be greatly improved. The
absence of a dynamic extension service is probably reducing the effectiveness
and hence the economic returns of other major investment programs in credit
and irrigation. DRA recently requested IDA assistance for establishing a more
effective service.
1.08      Credit. 1/  Informal credit markets are still predominant, but
recent growth of institutional credit facilities and use through AgBank and
commercial banks has been encouraging. AgBank has 13 branches and 4 sub-
branches and with UNDP/IDA/DRA assistance has evolved as one of the strongest
and best managed institutions in Afghanistan. The number of loans disbursed
has grown from 44 in 1969/70 to 81,000 in 1976/77. Recently loans to coopera-
tives has been a major growth area but AgBank is still probably assisting no
more than about 8% of total farmers. Security requirements are still weighted
in favor of registered land owners although some progress towards relaxation
has been made recently. A recently issued Decree (Number 6) has the effect
of reducing private land mortgages held on 2 ha or less, and in the case of

tenants and sharecroppers waiving all debts to landowners. 1/ It is too early
to judge the effects of this measure, but an attempt by AgBank or commercial
banks to fill any gap resulting from a downturn in traditional money lending
activities would require resources beyond those presently available to the
former. In an endeavor to meet the situation DRA is establishing village
'farmers unions' which will mobilize savings and lend to individuals for
personal use. The major issue is access to credit. Cooperative lending will
improve this but AgBank needs to appreciate that the best security is sound
appraisal, good loan supervision, and satisfied customers, while liberaliza-
tion advocates need to understand that institutional credit discipline among
farmers is essential if AgBank is to survive as a viable financial institution
and provide the credit services the nation needs.
1.09      Commitment to Rural Development.  The key to alleviating poverty
lies with devising and successfully implementing integrated rural development
programs which attack the problem of providing adequate basic human needs. In
the past too much emphasis has been placed by Government on 'visible' projects.
The technology is available with some local adaptation, which could substan-
tially increase most agricultural crop production thereby raising family
incomes and providing basic food security. But the technology and essential
support services must be extended to the farmers through decentralized agri-
cultural and rural development programs. Rural Afghanistan desperately needs
a deep Government commitment to attacking the basic elements of poverty,
devising programs relevant to village life and needs, and a will to build
mutual trust and respect with the people. The new Government has indicated a
better understanding of these needs and the proposed project would be a first
step towards application.
1.10      Institutional Issues.  Agricultural and rural development is con-
strained by a number of complex interrelating factors, but the overriding
issue in the past has been Government's inability to establish a satisfactory
policy framework and to provide effective supporting services. The operating
framework including administration, financial and staff management has been
inadequate to meet the needs of dynamic agricultural development programs.
Staff morale and motivation has been low and underutilization common. A
general staff reluctance to take field assignments is understandable as there
are few material rewards where facilities and transport are poor, good housing
difficult to obtain, and where support and interest from the center is less
than desirable.
D.  Previous Bank Group Assistance
1.11      IDA's assistance to agriculture with credits totalling US$109 mil-
lion, has hithertho concentrated on provision of credit for farm inputs,
promotion of livestock and fruit and vegetable production and constructing
new irrigation systems. Since 1969 IBRD has been the executing agency for a

tutional credit.

UNDP financed technical assistance project to AgBank. The First Agricultural
Credit Project (202-AF, US$5 million 1970) was successfully completed in 1976
with the exception of the minor irrigation rehabilitation component. Under
the Second Project (1975, 539-AF, US$13 million), AgBank has successfully
expanded its short term lending program, improved staff quality, and further
strengthened institutional aspects. A Third Project (721-AF US$12 million 1/)
commenced in 1977, will expand on existing operations. Performance under
these projects has generally been satisfactory. In livestock, IDA has fi-
nanced Livestock I (1973) and II (1976) Projects (375-AF, US$9 million and
649-AF, US$15 million) designed to capitalize on Afghanistan's quality sheep
and develop an export meat industry with supporting production and rural
infrastructural components. The projects which include assistance to nomadic
groups were seen as offering the opportunity to initiate 'self-sustaining'
rural development. Due to unsatisfactory administrative procedures, inexperi-
enced management, and absence of a commercial approach performance has been
behind schedule. A joint IDA/DRA review recently confirmed the Project's
viability but recent developments have slowed project implementation. In
irrigation IDA is financing Khanabad I (1971) including a supplementary credit
(1976), and II (1978) Projects (Credit 248--AF, US$5 million plus US$10 million
supplementary and 778-AF, US$22 million) and designed to modernize irrigation
of 30,000 hectares. Khanabad I is nearing completion, while Khanabad II is
just starting. A fruit and vegetable export project (Credit 779-AF, US$18
million) has just become effective and a wheat production project is currently
under appraisal. The Second Education Project (Credit 674-AF, US$6 million)
provides assistance for expanding agricultural high school education; a Third
Project (Credit 893-AF, US$21 million) incLudes a preinvestment design for
extension training and resource development facilities; and a Fourth Project
about to be appraised would expand extension and farmer training facilities.
II. THE PROJECCT AREA 2/
A. Physical Environment 3/
2.01      Ghazni and Wardak were selected from a group of provinces including
Samangan, Bamyan, Zabul, Uruzgan and Ghor with a total population of about
3.3 million and cultivated area of roughly 780,000 ha. Selection criteria
1/   Plus C$5 million from the Canadian International Development Agency.
2/   During negotiations the Afghan Delegation advised that the provincial
organization had recently changed; Wardak province has been absorbed
into Kabul; a new province Paktika, has absorbed part of Southern
Ghazni; the project area remains unchanged.

included:  (a) access from Kabul which permits utilization of existing infra-
structure, (b) financial constraints in meeting the entire regional require-
ments, (c) organization and management limitations, (d) potential for agri-
cultural and livestock production, and (f) a high percentage of population
living in absolute poverty. The provinces include about 10% of national popu-
lation, 6% of total land area, 6% of total land cultivated, 5% of national
irrigable land, 5% of the nation's sheep and goat population, 1% of total
available grazing land and only 2% of national registered motor vehicles.
Three agro-ecological zones are represented in the two provinces. A north-
west zone (48%) includes mountains up to more than 4,500 meters with narrow,
intensively irrigated, heavily populated valleys among vast grazing lands.
The central zone (27%) includes largely flat semi-arid areas with less
severe winters, moderate elevation of 1,900 to 2,300 meters, less precipita-
tion (220 to 350 mm) and insufficient water resources for irrigating the
larger areas of comparatively good soils. The southern zone (25%) is more
arid with low population density and is used extensively by migrating nomadic
pastoralists and transhumants 1/ for livestock grazing. Climate is semi-arid
continental with long cold winters, dry summers, and precipitation which
varies considerably from year to year and is strongly influenced by altitude.
About 92% of precipitation occurs from December to June and a high proportion
falls as snow. At Ghazni town (elevation 2,200 meters) precigitation is 290
mm and some 145 days annually experience temperatures below 0 C. The severe
climatic conditions limit crop rotations and production. However, where water
supply is adequate climatic conditions favor seed potato production and
temperate fruits and vegetables. The total land area of Ghazni and Wardak
provinces is estimated at 4.3 million hectares of which 227,000 ha (5%) is
cultivated, 464,000 ha (11%) is designated pasture, 29,000 ha (0.7%) forest,
and the balance of 3.5 million ha (83%) mountains and desert. Soils are
mainly of alluvial origin, light textured with generally good external and
internal drainage. The main differences occur according to the local
intensity of irrigation and inspite of soil and topography limitations,
about 350,000 hectares have been classified as Class 2 and 3 lands.
2.02       No reliable statistics are available on farm size distribution and
average holding size, but the number of large holdings appears to be less
concentrated than in some other provinces. The average-sized holding is
about 1.6 hectares; but is probably a little higher in Ghazni. Land ownership
pattern and landlord-tenant relationships are traditional. About 53% of
cultivated land in Ghazni is owner-operated, 37% share cropped, and about 10%
farmed by large landlords. Most holdings are highly fragmented. Share
cropping comprises two forms, "Buzgar" and "Keshtegar".  Under the latter the
sharecropper provides all inputs except land and water, and receives 50% of
the crop, while the 'Buzgar' provides only labor and receives 20%. Irrigation
water is the most scarce resource. Traditionally agriculture depends on
numerous small irrigation systems comprising mainly river diversions and
1/   Nomads are defined as people who live permanently in tents with no
fixed abode. Transhumants include those who have a permanent residence
but who spend some months in tents migrating with their flocks.

karezes. Total irrigable land area is estimated at about 143,000 hectares;
63% by river diversion, 18% from karezes, 16% from springs, and about 3% from
groundwater exploitation including wells. Irrigation system characteristics
include considerable water and labor wastage due to frequent damage to the
farmer-constructed diversion structures and upstream canal sections close to
river banks; canals not having gated controls at their intakes and thus being
subject to frequent high siltation during floods; and wild flooding irrigation
with low efficiency (less than 40%). Also the high cost of kareze maintenance
together with their year-long uncontrolled discharge results in high water
wastage.
2.03      One asphalt road, about 230 km long and linking Kabul to Maidan and
Ghazni and continuing south to Kandahar, exists in the project area. Unpaved
roads link the two provincial capitals with about 31 district centers and the
most important villages. About 366 km of Secondary and tertiary roads in
Wardak and 2,550 km in Ghazni exist, some :in reasonbly good condition, but
others, mostly in mountainous sections, are little more than tracks. Many
roads cross canals without culverts.  Including Ghazni town, reticulated water
supplies do not exist; as a result, the same surface water sources are used
for drinking, stock watering and irrigation, and are usually heavily polluted.
There is no electricity supply to the two provinces except for Ghazni town,
which is served from the power grid. Kerosene is widely used for lighting
and operating pumpsets. Wheat mills are either water powered, or operate by
diesel engines. The most common cooking and heating fuels are dried animal
manure and brushwood; a critical shortage of domestic fuel wood exists.
B. Population
2.04      The population of Ghazni and Wardak provinces is estimated respec-
tively at about I million and 370,000, of which the rural population is about
1.2 million (86%), and consists of 142,000 families inhabiting about 3,000
villages. Population density is closely related to water availability but
averages about 33/km2, which is 50% higher than the national average of about
22/km2. Although largely illiterate, farmers are capable, hard working, and
respond to innovations provided risks are minimized and the technology is
proven. Nomadic pastoralists whose number is not known are important to the
area's economy. The mountains to the north and west are important summer
grazing areas while large numbers of transhumants also spend the summer in
Katawaz. Many nomads and transhumants migrate outside of the project area for
the winter. National annual population growth rate is estimated at 2.2% and
is probably about the same in the project area. With increasing population,
fragmentation of holdings is continuing and forced migration to urban areas or
into limited non-farm employment opportunities is also increasing. Except for
the narrow valleys of mountainous regions the problem is shortage or scarcity
of water but not land. With available water supplies and traditional wasteful
water use practices, production in the irrigated areas has already reached
levels that are nearly maximum within the limits of technology known or avail-
able to these farmers. Increasing population, therefore, results in either
urban migration or greater poverty. More recently, many unemployed have



- 9 -
migrated seasonally to oil rich neighboring countries but this cannot be
relied on as a permanent source of employment. Thus, an improvement in pro-
ductivity and utilization of irrigation water is a vital necessity if even
meager rural living standards are to be maintained.
2.05       The population is almost entirely Muslim and the two dominant
languages Pashtu and Dari are spoken by most. The basic unit of Afghan life
is the village, which may range in size from as few as 10 families to as many
as 500. Perhaps the largest number of villages falls into the range of 40
to 80 families. Villagers are linked by ties of marriage and kinship. In
the past larger landowners have been very influential. Village life centers
around agriculture, which is at the mercy of precipitation. In dry years the
wheat crop is only one-half of that in the average year, and in good years
it doubles. Health of most inhabitants is poor as at least 80% of households
drink polluted water. Common ailments include anaemia, major digestive
problems, respiratory problems, and a high incidence, particularly among
children, of conjunctivitis. While the project area includes about 10% of
the national population, basic health centers and related facilities including
pharmacies and hospitals are proportionately less; there are only 4 hospitals
and 9 basic health clinics. Few villagers are literate; only about 6% of the
total national primary school enrollments (654,000) are recorded in the proj-
ect area. Similarly, middle school enrollments amount to about 6% of the
national total. Of the 7 to 12-year age group, only about 40% attend primary
school in Wardak, and 10% in Ghazni. No education facilities are available
for nomads. Motor vehicle registration including cars, trucks, buses, and
official vehicles total only 1,028 or 2% of the national total.
C. Economy
2.06       Population of the two provinces represents about 10% of the national
total and land about 6%. Similarly, the total land area cultivated (227,000
hectares) represents about 6% of the total land cultivated in Afghanistan (4
million hectares). Total irrigable land (143,000 hectares) constitutes about
5% of the land area which again is comparable to the national figure of about
4%. Of this irrigable land, about 80% is actually irrigated, of which no more
than 75% would be irrigated in any one year. Wheat is the predominant crop
with a total area of about 134,000 hectares representing about 6% of the total
annual national area. At 1.3 tons per hectare, yields are low in Ghazni but at
1.6 tons are better in Wardak, where water supply is more reliable. Potatoes
are an important crop constituting about 15,000 hectares or 75% of the total
annual area sown to potatoes in Afghanistan. Potato yields of 10-12 tons per
hectare are low and reflect poor seed quality and low fertilizer use. Other
cereals including maize and barley are relatively unimportant, constituting
only 1% of the national total at about 7,400 hectares. Fruits (apricots,
almonds, apples, grapes) are important. Total area under fruits, vegetables,
and forage is said to be about 20,000 hectares or about 5% of the national
total of 373,000 hectares. Wheat production does not meet consumption plus
seed demand in the Project Area. Probably about 30-40% of the annual wheat
production of around 180-190,000 tons is traded annually.  Potato production

probably totals around 178,000 tons annually with perhaps 40-50,000 tons being
traded. As with potatoes and fruit, Kabul is the most important market for
project area livestock products particularly sheep and goats, wool, hides and
skins. Livestock production is important with few village households owning
no animals. Sheep and goats constitute 5% of the national flock, cattle 11%,
poultry 12% and other livestock (camels, donkeys, horses) 6%. Productivity is
low but the potential for improvement is substantial. Poplar tree production
is marketed in both Kabul and Kandahar. Average per capita income in Ghazni
is probably lower than the national 1976/77 rural figure of US$120. National
rural absolute poverty income level is US$85 (1976/77). In Ghazni and Wardak
it would be about the same. About 800,000 persons (60% of population) prob-
ably live in or near a state of absolute poverty. Greatest concentration of
these poor would be in the mountain regions and areas where irrigation water
is insufficient.  Women do not usually work outside of the family homes.
Occasionally they help in the fields, but social custom confines them to
family and home.  In some areas they are engaged in handicraft production,
particularly rugs and carpets. In the project area, however, except for the
mountainous parts of Ghazni and Wardak, village handicraft production is not
widespread.
III. DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTIONS
A. Provincial Administration I/
3.01      The provincial administrations of Ghazni and Wardak are each headed
by an appointed Governor responsible to the Ministry of Interior, and holding
a rank equivalent to a Deputy Minister. The Governor is responsible for
administration including law and order, defence, education, health, agricul-
ture and rural development. He is assisted by a number of sub-governors
(Woleswalis). Each sub-governorate is further divided into districts
(Alaqadaris). In Ghazni there are 24 districts and in Wardak 9. The Governor
is also chairman of the Provincial Rural Development Committee which includes
subgovernors, representatives of various ministries and departments and
Government appointed people's representatives. Representatives of various
departments are responsible administratively to the Governor and technically
to their ministries in Kabul. Annual budget is prepared by the central
ministries in Kabul, approved by the Planning and Finance ministries and the
Cabinet, and channeled through respective ministries.  Provincial adminis-
tration is highly centralized with the Governor exercising considerable
influence and authority.
1/   Outline of present Government Organization is given in Annex 1, Chart 2;
following recent administrative changes, the Project area will now
involve the 'Governorates' of Kabul, Ghazni and Paktika.



- 12 -
B. Ministry of Agriculture (MA) 1/
3.02      The Director General of Extension and Agriculture Development in
Ghazni is responsible for the administration and coordination of all MA
provincial activities. Senior staff include a Veterinary Services Director
with 9 supporting professionals; Extension Director with 73 extension agents;
Forestry Director including 20 supporting professionals; Cooperative Director
with 9 cooperative agents; and a Plant Protection Director. Each Director
has access to one 4-wheel drive vehicle and many supporting staff have motor-
cycles, which due to maintenance problems and administrative procedures are
not always mobile. Housing is not generally provided but recently ten houses
have been constructed in Ghazni and a further ten are under construction.
Provincial staff motivation is reasonable but could be improved by better
operating programs, more support with adequate vehicles, equipment and housing,
and intensified inservice training. No agricultural research station operates
in Ghazni or Wardak.  For transportation the majority of professional staff
have to rely on public buses which are slow, and often unreliable. In Wardak
MA has a similar structure. The Director General of Extension and Agricultural
Development is supported by Directors of veterinary services, extension, plant
protection, forestry and range management and cooperatives. The number of
staff operating in Wardak is correspondingly less. The vehicle situation is
probably worse than in Ghazni and no houses are provided.
C. Rural Development D)epartment (RDD) 2/
3.03      The present RDD was established in 1972 as a part of the Prime
Minister's office.  It was provided with a charter to undertake rural social
and economic development including responsibilities for minor irrigation
schemes, most secondary and tertiary roads, and integrated rural development
including health, agricultural and social activities in specially designated
areas. RDD was previously responsible to a group of ministers, the 'High
Council of Rural Development', which was recently abolished. RDD remains
within the Prime Minister's office and for Project implementation purposes,
coordination, planning and policy guidance will now be given by the Presidents'
Council for Coordination of Rural Development (PCCRD) chaired by the RDD
President and comprising the Presidents of concerned departments and agencies
including Agricultural Extension, Veterinary, Cooperatives, Planning and
AgBank.
1/   Outline of present Government Organization is given in Annex 1, Chart 2;
following recent administrative changes, the Project area will now
involve the Governorates of Kabul, Ghazni and Paktika.
2/   Annex 1, Chart 4 presents existing R)D Organization.



- 13 -
3.04      RDD has two forms of provincial organization.  A typical provincial
Directorate comprises a Director and up to about 15 lesser rank staff, which
usually does not include an engineer. The office assists RDD teams from
Kabul, makes prefeasibility studies, and implements certain small schemes on
its own. The provincial Director is also secretary of the Provincial Rural
Development Committee. The other organization involves a project committee
for those areas where Integrated Rural Development (IRD) projects have been
proposed. These regions may well be within a province as in Ghazni, where
Katawaz Loi Woleswali is a designated IRD region with a Director General as
head and a large number of supporting staff including health, agricultural
extension, research, animal husbandry, and education. The Central Kabul
office performs three basic functions; coordination through the President's
committee, planning of projects and programs, and execution. Ghazni and
Wardak each have an RDD Directorate with a Director and supporting staff.
Project construction is the responsibility of RDD Central office through 10
construction teams each composed of one civil engineer, one administration
officer, 4 technicians, a technical supervisor, and support staff. During
construction beneficiaries usually provide labor which is paid for by WFP food
rations while RDD provides technical guidance, equipment and materials. Field
offices identify the needs of rural people, prepare project requests for
presentation to the provincial committee, and their transmission to head
office, mobilize local resources to assist construction teams, and procure
locally available materials.
3.05      By the end of March 1978 Ghazni RDD had completed construction of
six bridges and designed a further 12. In Wardak eleven had been completed
and a further two designed. Fifteen irrigation projects had been completed
in Ghazni and a further five designed. In Wardak only one wash-crossing had
been completed, another is under construction, and an additional one in the
design stage. Throughout the whole of Afghanistan the RDD 1978 summer program
included 59 irrigation structures, five roads, 29 bridges, 3 foot bridges,
and 8 other construction programs. In addition, it is expected that about 40
culverts would be constructed in each province plus a number of minor projects.
Total 1977-78 budget amounted to AF 101.2 mil. (US$2.5 mil.) of which an esti-
mated AF 92.7 mil. or 92% was spent. Budget for 1978-79 is AF 110 mil. (US$2.8
mil.). Permanent RDD staff include about 230 'professionals', 380 general
service, and 415 non-permanent contractors. Professionals include about 30
engineers, 17 agronomists, 5 economists, 5 education specialists and 4 doctors;
the remaining are sub-professionals. RDD currently receives technical assis-
tance from an 8 man UN team and two Indian Government community development
experts. WFP assists through food incentives to villagers to participate in
self-help schemes and as a supplement to cash wages under Government schemes.
Since 1974 USAID has been providing financial and technical assistance with a
second phase project (1976) including construction on a fixed cost reimburse-
ment basis of rural works projects which directly benefit the rural poor. Two
USAID technicians presently work part-time with RDD.
D. Agricultural Development Bank of Afghanistan (AgBank)
3.06      AgBank was reorganized in 1969 and a revised charter adopted in
1970. Since then it has undergone a remarkable transformation from a poorly



- 14 -
organized channel for disbursement of state budget funds to an operationally
autonomous, efficiently managed revenue generating institution. It has
become the premier financial institution for agriculture with an effective
and functional organization. It is now 100% Government owned and is generally
under Central Bank supervision. AgBank's Board of Directors establishes
policies and makes major decisions, while an executive board directs day to
day operations. AgBank makes short-, medium and long-term loans for an
expanding range of agricultural investments including farm mechanization,
on-farm development, production inputs, livestock, agrobusiness and marketing.
Its loan portfolio has nearly tripled in four years to over AF 1.7 billion
(US$42.5 million) as of March 1978. Following the advent of the new Govern-
ment, AgBank Senior staffing was largely changed. Despite this the institu-
tion has shown stability and the new leadership is proving satisfactory.
Implementation of Land Reform is currently affecting activities and causing
security and repayment problems. Future demands on AgBank's resources are
likely to be very strong and will test the institution's strength.
3.07      Given farmers' unfamiliarity with institutional credit discipline,
AgBank has been conservative in securing loans, and requires mortgage of land
or in some cases Promissory Notes guaranteed by landowners, as security for
medium and long-term loans. These land-related security requirements have
restricted the availability of credit since mortgaging land is complicated
and costly. AgBank's short-term lending for fertilizer and other inputs is
an effective operation with loans secured by joint and several guarantees of
groups of five to ten farmers. Presently these loans are not individually
appraised or supervised and first year collection rates are low. AgBank
has plans to introduce a pass book system to facilitate individual borrowing
and selective individual appraisal. Interest rates (8% for medium and long-
term, 10% for short term) are positive in real terms 1/ and cover present
capital and operating costs and generate profit margins, although AgBank still
relies on a Government guarantee of the short term lending program and does
not write off bad debts. The Supply Depart:ment of AgBank imports tractors and
water pumps and related farm machinery for sale on credit to farmers. It also
provides a backup after sales service which is presently undergoing reorganiza-
tion and strengthening with a UNDP/FAO technical assistance project in support.
3.08      AgBank has a branch in Ghazni with 4 field inspectors (appraisers)
under a branch Director responsible for loan evaluation and supervision. A
deputy branch Director is in charge of 10 fertilizer agents who are respon-
sible for administering the short-term lending and loan collection program.
In 1976/77 medium-term loans granted included tractors (6), water pumps (8),
flour mills (1), establishment of vineyards (7), and purchase of livestock
(10). Total volume of financing was AF 3.8 million in 1976/77. Short-term
loans for fertilizer, plant protection and improved seed totalled to 384 with
a total loan amount of AF 1.5 million. Wardak is presently served from
AgBank's Kabul office but credit activities could be expanded by opening local
offices.
1/   Inflation in 1976-78 averaged about 6-8%.  For the period 1979 through
1981, the inflation rate is unlikely to average more than 8% (World Bank
projections).



- 15 -
E. Afghan Fertilizer Company (AFC)
3.09      AFC established in 1973 as a wholly independent subsidiary of AgBank,
is responsible for fertilizer procurement, storage and distribution. More
recently its activities have included the purchase and distribu-t-ion--af imiproved
seeds produced by Afghan Seed Company (ASC) and monopoly purchase and sale of
agro-chemicals, including veterinary medicines. It has expanded its activities
rapidly, distributing 100,000 tons of fertilizer during 1977-78, and has built
up a satisfactory organization including a wide distribution system, with
about 600 retailers who sell on a commission basis. All urea is supplied from
a local plant while diammonium phosphate and other fertilizers are imported.
Government-determined fertilizer prices presently are AF 10,000/ton (US$250)
for urea and for diammonium phosphate AF 11,400 (US$285). Compared to current
world prices, urea is not subsidized but diammonium phosphate and other fertil-
izers presently are. AFC maintains a supply depot in Ghazni with three ware-
houses (capacity 2,400 tons) constructed with IDA assistance under the Second
Agricultural Credit Project (549-AF). Wardak province is served from AFC's
Kabul head office, while Ghazni has a regional office with a staff of five.
Private retail outlets total 26 in Ghazni and 15 in Wardak, with three AFC
agro-chemical shops. There is close cooperation between AgBank and AFC.
About 70% of fertilizer sales are financed by AgBank credit and about 30% are
cash sales; the percentage of cash sales is increasing.
F. Ministry of Water and Power (WAPM)
3.10      Since 1974 responsibility for water, irrigation (excluding minor
schemes) and power development has been under the control of WAPM. It is
responsible for the implementation of all major irrigation projects including
Sardeh Dam (assisted by Soviet aid) in Ghazni province. Sardeh was completed
in 1967 and, when the command area is fully developed, will irrigate 15,000
hectares. Government is planning to establish large state farms, which will
be irrigated from this Dam. These would include the ASC seed farm, a sheep
and poultry production complex, and an applied agricultural research station.
The Ministry is also officially responsible for the management of Bande Seraj
dam above Ghazni town, but its operation is directed by the Governor using
unqualified personnel. WAPM does not maintain a regular office in Ghazni
town.
G. Environmental Health Department (EHD) I/
3.11      The Ministry of Public Health has a Department of Environmental
Health, whose responsibilities include the improvement of rural and urban
1/   Para. 3.11 describes the position at appraisal time; during negotiations
the Afghan delegation advised that EHD's water supply responsibilities
had been transferred to a new Department in the Public Works Ministry.



- 16 -
water supplies, urban sewage and waste disposal and, with UNICEF and WHO
assistance, the implementation of a recently introduced village health
worker scheme. Its prime activities include the implementation of a UNICEF/
WHO supported rural water supply scheme. Only about 5% of rural population
is presently provided with reasonably safe drinking water. EHD has estab-
lished five Zonal Centers (ZC) to strengthen its administrative and implemen-
tation capacity including Kabul and Kandahar which service Ghazni and Wardak.
ZC's are headed by engineers and staffed with other skilled personnel required
for carrying out the program. Presently, a planning engineer, hydrogeologist,
and drilling engineer are included in the UNICEF technical assistance team
and a WHO sanitary engineer also assists. UNICEF also supplies equipment
and operating materials including pipes. EHD has 8 light drilling rigs with
a heavy drilling rig operated on its behalf by WAPM Groundwater Department
and a further 2 heavy rigs expected soon. Present EHD capacity is installation
of about 25 rural water schemes annually. EHD's program in the two provinces
has so far identified about 120 village water supply schemes largely oriented
towards schools, health centers and hospitals. Operations have not yet
started and probably only 5 or 6 would be completed annually. This is in
addition to about 50 UNICEF/RDD schemes to be completed during the next five
years. A backup maintenance unit has not operated at maximum efficiency.
Within the rural water supply scheme EHD endeavors to implement a village
health worker training scheme under which literate villagers are trained to
undertake basic health first aid, sell certain approved medicines and educate
people in the advantages of using pollution free water. ZC's are responsible
for preparation and implementation of the annual work programs, surveys,
construction, maintenance, data compilation, disinfection of water sources and
health education. Close cooperation exists between RDD, EHD, and UNICEF/WHO
in the planning and implementation of rural water supply schemes.
H. Afghan Cartographic and Cadastral Survey Institute (ACCSI)
3.12      ACCSI was formed in 1973 with the merger of the cadastral survey
and the cartographic institutes. The Institute with headquarters in Kabul is
divided into 5 departments including administration, geodetic, photogrammetric,
cartographic and reproduction, and engineering surveys. Technical and equip-
ment assistance is presently given by a 5-man UNDP team. ACCSI maintains a
Ghazni office with 56 staff including 50 technicians, responsible for 4
provinces including Ghazni and Wardak. Presently, about 24% of cultivated
land in Wardak has been surveyed and about 13% in Ghazni. Until recently the
cadastral survey methods used were slow and not entirely accurate. More
recently aerial survey and orthophoto plan production has been introduced.
Orthophoto plans can be produced in less time and with greater accuracy than
that needed for normal ground survey.
I. Department of Cooperative Development (DCD)
3.13      DCD was established within the 14inistry of Agriculture in 1973.
The cooperative law enacted in 1974 was recently amended to exclude farmers



- 17 -
owning more than 30 jeribs (6 ha) from membership. Furthermore, memberhsip
fees are now related to size of holding and in emergency cases the coopera-
tive may extend loans to individuals at 4% for a period of one year up to
80% of the applicants membership fee deposited. DCD grew out of the success-
ful experience of the Project on Agricultural Credit and Cooperatives in
Afghanistan (PACCA) which commenced in 1968 and was financed by the Swedish
International Development Authority (SIDA) and executed by FAO. In 1973,
Government decided upon cooperative development in several provinces with
essential support services being provided by other relevant departments and
agencies. DCD has responsibility to promote the establishment and registra-
tion of cooperatives, audit accounts, draft regulations, and provide assis-
tance and advice on organization and management. It currently has a total
staff of about 430 of whom 293 (67%) are stationed in 12 provincial field
offices including Ghazni. The national total of primary societies has grown
from 11 in 1974 (2 registered) to 135 including 2 unions and about 13,000
members in June 1978. No cooperatives are registered in Wardak, and only 4
with about 300 members in Ghazni. In the past cooperative field staff have
too often been arbitrarily assigned with inadequate preparation or orientation
towards small farmer needs and unclear definition of their work responsibili-
ties. In addition, most cooperatives which are largely service and marketing
oriented, have tended to be seen rather as Government agencies and few have
been self-reliant. Moreover, the cooperative law has been interpreted by
Government officials as excluding tenants and sharecroppers as potential
members. DRA considers the development of sound multipurpose agricultural
cooperatives as an important means of accelerating agricultural development
and to be an integral part of the land reform program. The new Five-Year
Plan is expected to include provision for a rapid increase in cooperative
numbers and a major reorganization of DCD including training is presently
being planned. Organized at local, regional and national level they are seen
as a means of providing farmers with greater access to production inputs,
institutional credit, the marketing system and improved technology. Currently
an intensified system of supervision of cooperative agents and cooperative
activities is being implemented by DCD. Cooperative annual accounts audit is,
with one or two minor exceptions up to schedule. Following the completion of
the SIDA financed FAO executed technical assistance project in December 1978,
UNDP has undertaken to finance a phase 3 project with 4 experts and 5 asso-
ciate experts. DRA has recently requested IDA assistance to implement its
cooperative development program.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Introduction
4.01      The proposed project was prepared in October 1976 by an FAO/IBRD
Cooperative Program Mission and a report submitted to GOA and IDA in January
1977. IDA missions in 1977 assisted with final project preparation. The
project would represent the first IDA assisted effort aimed specifically at
the Afghan rural poor. It is Government's intention to replicate similar
projects in neighboring provinces based upon lessons learnt from the proposed
project.



- 18 -
B. Project Objecztives
4.02      The Project would aim at directly increasing the income and standard
of living of about 40% of the Ghazni-Wardak rural population, including more
equitable income distribution, improved distribution of Government services,
and satisfying poorest farmers' basic needs. The proposed strategy includes
improving small farm production and income through improvement in irrigation
water supply; increasing use of fertilizer and improved seed; improving
access to credit; increasing the efficiency of and farmer access to veterinary,
extension and cooperative services; improving rural roads; and providing
pollution free water supplies in a limited number of villages. The Project
would strengthen Government Provincial services including capability in sub-
project design and implementation procedures and systematic evaluation of
Project impact. It would represent the first step in the Government's policy
of concentrating resources for agricultural and rural development into a few
selected areas.
C. Brief Description
4.03      The proposed Project would constitute a first stage in a long-term
development program designed to improve the social and economic well being of
the Ghazni-Wardak rural population. It would focus on arresting the dete-
rioration of, and emphasizing the proper use of the region's natural resource
base, including soils, vegetative cover and water. It would mobilize vil-
lagers to participate in the planning and implementation of the infrastructure
and the services to be established; and would concentrate on strengthening the
concerned Government institutions thereby helping to ensure effective project
implementation and enhancing the capacity of these institutions to undertake
subsequent development schemes.
4.04      The Project would consist of the following activities in various
sectors; the proportionate costs of these activities as compared to total
project costs including contingencies are indicated below, whereas the cost
estimate is on page 32.
(a) Agricultural Investments (56%). Minor irrigation rehabili-
tation (17%), including improving the reliability of water
supply in traditional main canals, increasing efficiency of
water use, and reduction of crop yield losses; agricultural
extension (7%), including increasing and upgrading the
quality and number of extension agents and rapidly extending
existing and new technology to as large a number of farmers
as possible; applied agricultural research (2%), including
the development of improved technology adapted to the
project area and the target group and designed to yield the
maximum economic returns from each unit of land and water on
both irrigated and rainfed land; agricultural cooperatives
(3%), including the establishment of viable, self-sufficient,
multi-purpose service cooperatives and the efficient supervi-
sion and training of cooperative office bearers and members;



- 19 -
range management and survey (1%), including assistance to
nomads and survey work designed to increase knowledge of the
ecology, sociology, and economy of the project area range-
lands and leading ultimately to the preparation of a pilot
range management project; agricultural credit (17%), includ-
ing improved access to and use of credit for short-term
seasonal inputs and medium- and long-term productive invest-
ments both to individuals and cooperatives and for private
village workshop owners; veterinary and livestock (8%),
including the establishment of a village veterinary service,
improving the efficiency and operation of a mobile veterinary
service and improving animal production extension to farmers;
and cadastral survey (1%), including accelerating progress of
reliable cadastral survey and the registration of most irri-
gated land in the two provinces.
(b)  Rural Infrastructure (24%).  Minor road improvement (20%),
including the establishment of a unit capable of upgrading
and maintaining to reasonable all-weather status about
400 km of feeder and tertiary roads; and village water
supplies (4%), including the installation of pollution free
reliable domestic water supply in about one hundred villages
with a supporting education program.
(c)  Project Planning, Coordination and Evaluation, and Technical
Assistance (20%), including the establishment of a regional
planning and implementation unit (8%) responsible for planning,
administration and coordination, building construction, procure-
ment, operation of workshops, public relations and monitoring
and evaluation; technical assistance (9%), including providing
guidance and advice on the establishment and effective opera-
tion of all aspects of the regional planning and implementation
unit and preparing specific training programs for concerned
Government agencies; and feasibility studies (3%) for dam
storage expansion and a new moderate sized irrigation dam;
and the preparation of a second rural development project.
4.05      The Ministry of Agriculture and RDD would play the major roles in
project implementation. The Provincial Government departments and agencies
would be responsible for implementing the Project, over a five year period,
within their respective jurisdictions. These departments would at the provin-
cial level, come under the direction of the Provincial Rural Development
Council (PRDC) to which the RDD's Regional Planning and Implementation Unit
(RPIU) would act as secretariat. RDD RPIU would act as the planning and
coordinating body through PRDCs. The project activities would not commence
in Wardak until project year three, following the establishment of effective
implementation programs in Ghazni, and would ultimately cover most districts
in the two provinces. In order to strengthen Government's ability to provide
services in more remote villages the Project would improve the implementation
capacity of participating Government services at district level through train-
ing and institution building. Furthermore, technical staff would be upgraded
and provided with the transport, equipment, program and supervision necessary
to allow them to perform their tasks effectively.

D. Project Detailed Features
(i) Agricultural Investments
4.06       Minor Irrigation Rehabilitation (US$6.7 mil.). 1/  The Project would
finance the equipment, transport facilities and staff required for the con-
struction of about 100 medium and 50 small permanent diversion weirs and in-
takes, and about 40 medium and 30 small wash crossings. The objective would
be to improve the reliability of irrigation water supply in traditional main
canals, and reduce water and crop yield losses due to inadequate intakes and
wash crossings being destroyed during spring floods. Canal maintenance time
and costs would be reduced, thus allowing farmers time to improve irrigation
efficiency, crop weeding and general farm husbandry. Rehabilitation costs
would be met by the Project but DRA would initiate a study to be completed by
March 31, 1981, which would examine inter alia the sociological, economic and
financial implications of introducing a recommended cost recovery system for
minor irrigation rehabilitation to be implemented not later than March 31,
1982. The traditional system consists of a river diversion weir formed by
dumping stones and covering with brush, wood and clay. Canals have uncon-
trolled open heads, and cross minor valleys by throwing mud walls across the
floor on the downstream side. These structures are extensively damaged during
spring floods with consequent adverse affects on crop growth. Farmers spend
ten to fifteen days each season repairing damage, involving up to 3,000 man
days for an average canal commanding about 150 hectares.
4.07       Four construction units, including a pile driving unit with adequate
equipment, and a small precast concrete-making unit, would be established
within RDD-RPIU to carry out the works (Arnex 1, Chart 3). At full develop-
ment, in project year six, the proposed rehabilitation works would improve
spring and early summer irrigation reliability, with consequential reduction
of canal maintenance costs, on an estimated 17,000 hectares. Special atten-
tion would be paid to management of Bande Seraj Dam situated about 40 km
upstream of Ghazni town with a storage capacity of about 25 Mm. Existing
capacity, coupled with the average annual riverflow, is capable of adequately
irrigating about 3,000 hectares, but the actual area irrigated is estimated
at no more than 2,000 hectares. Under the Project, the dam operation would
remain under WAPM technical control, but would be managed on the basis of
a policy agreed upon by PRDC, WAPM and RDD-RPIU, including supervision by
qualified engineers. Even with moderate efficiency, an additional 1,000
hectares could be effectively brought under irrigation through improved water
storage management.
4.08       As specific intakes and canals for rehabilitation have not been
identified, each improvement program would be subject to appraisal including
a satisfactory cost benefit analysis carried out by the RPIU minor irrigation
rehabilitation unit. The first three appraisals including details of pro-
posed structural designs, would be sent to IDA for review and comment before
1/   Figures in parentheses are total costs including physical and price con-
tingencies.

actual work commenced and others would be reviewed by IDA supervision missions.
Beneficiaries would continue to be responsible for normal canal maintenance
using existing satisfactory organizations and systems. Heavy engineering
support would be provided by RDD-RPIU which would continue operations after
completion of project implementation. Criterion for selection of canals for
rehabilitation would include a minimum financial rate of return over a ten-
year time horizon of 15%; at least 50% of beneficiaries would own no more than
4 hectares (20 jeribs); canal intake size would not be increased to the detri-
ment of downstream users on the river; command area farmers would agree to meet
all maintenance costs and where practicable, provide unskilled labor required
for work construction on a basis agreed upon among themselves; and they would
agree to come within the improved extension and veterinary services influence
zone. More detailed appraisal criteria are shown in the Project File Working
Paper C9. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that these detailed
selection criteria would be followed during project implementation.
4.09      Agricultural Extension (US$2.7 mil.).  The agricultural extension
service in the project area would be reorganized, intensified and strengthened,
using a system successfully proven in India and other developing countries.
The Project would provide farmers, on a regular systematic basis, with up-to-
date advice on the demonstration of farming practices best suited to their
conditions and capable of having an immediate impact on production and income.
This would be achieved by strictly programmed visits from regularly trained
field staff, supported by professional advice from within the extension
service, from research, and from foreign technical experts.  Extension staff
would not be involved with other regulatory and administrative Ministry
of Agriculture functions and there would be close cooperation with AgBank
and AFC.
4.10      Based on an effective ratio of one Village Extension Worker (VEW)
to about every 270 adopting farm families, VEW's would cover in year 7, about
48,000 farm families in the project area or about one-third of total popula-
tion. 1/ Actual number of farms covered by each VEW would be varied from about
200 to 400, depending on population density and communication net work. Each
extension unit would be divided into eight smaller groups of 25 to 50 farmers,
each to be visited regularly on a given day of the week. VEW's would work
primarily through about 8 to 10 contact farmers selected by the villagers.
The message communicated would be simple, concentrating on the most important
crops and initially on improved cultural practices of immediate relevance and
in most cases not involving increased expenditure. VEW's could receive the
extension message at training sessions held one to two days every two weeks by
supervisors (ES) supported by Subject Matter Specialists (SMS). Of the
remaining twelve days in the two-week period two would be devoted to demon-
strations, field trials, making up missed visits and administrative work, two
days to holidays, and eight days to visiting farmers. Fortnightly training of
1/   Ratio of extension agents to total farm families of both provinces would
be 1:800; it is assumed that about 1/3 of these would be effectively
covered by this project; many communities are so isolated that providing
an effective service is impractical; see details in Project File working
paper C-6.



- 22 -
VEW's would be a major feature.  Supervisors and SMS's would be trained for
two days each month at district level by district staff, backed up by research
station staff, head headquarters, and technical assistance experts. Adequate
equipment and extension aids would be provided for staff training. In addi-
tion to existing project area extension staff, 8 SMS, 7 ES, and 65 VEW would
be required to implement the Project over 5 years. This would give a total
in the two provinces of 8 SMS, 23 ES, and 177 VEW. SMS in agronomy, plant
protection, irrigation and water management, and training would be provided
to strengthen technical backup. Foreign technical expertise would include
farm management-extension, training, range management, and livestock produc-
tion. Project File working paper C-6 provides further details, including the
technical packages involved.
4.11      As the proposed extension methodology is based on regular and
frequent farm visits by VEW's, field staff and supervisors should live near
their work and be sufficiently mobile to function effectively. Housing
available in rural areas is limited, and the Project would provide moderate
housing, designed and constructed by RDD-RPIU, for all extension service
staff including VEW, SMS, ES, and district staff. The Project would also
provide additional equipment, vehicles, including motorcycles for supervisors
and bicycles for VEW. Motorcycles and bicycles would be sold to staff on
credit, similar to that outlined for the veterinary component (para. 4.18).
The Project provides for fellowships for district directors and supervisors
to make short intensive studies of similar extension services in neighboring
developing countries. The extension service would, in conjunction with
other Government service agencies (AgBank, AFC, Cooperatives) establish a
number of Farm Service Centers, which would serve as a focal point for farmer
information and training and improvement of farmer access to Government
agricultural services.
4.12      Agricultural Research (US$747,000).  The Project would establish a
20 hectare applied agricultural station. 1/  Prime objectives would include
developing improved technology, adapted to the project area climate, soils,
and water availability, and to the target group, and designed to yield maximum
economic returns by both unit of land and water. The research unit would pro-
vide backup training and specialist advice for the extension service subject
matter specialists and supervisors. It would ensure rapid analysis and early
publication of trial data, and initiate research designed to develop effective
economic soil conservation techniques, on both rainfed and irrigated land, and
cooperate with other relevant agencies to develop improved water utilization
within traditional irrigation systems. Sufficient technical packages are
presently available for key crops but work would have to be accelerated to
ensure a continuing flow of new technology within 2 or 3 years for use by the
expanded extension service. In order to cover as broad a range of soil types
and environments as possible, some research would be conducted on farmers'
fields under practical conditions and the supervision of extension agents
supported by research specialists, and on small outstations. Research would

be established on the Sardeh irrigation command area in Ghazni.



- 23 -
also cooperate closely with the Forestry Department and the Range Management
ERIC. Visits to the research station by farmers and extension agents would be
a regular activity.
4.13      Cooperatives (US$1.2 mil).  Through the Ministry of Agriculture
Department of Cooperative Development (DCD) the Project would promote the
establishment of at least 150 viable, self-sufficient multi-purpose service
cooperatives, including cooperatives among nomads, in the project area where
presently 4 cooperatives are registered with 40 applications under processing.
The cooperative movement is a corner stone of the Government's new agricul-
tural and rural development policy. In addition to providing credit through
AgBank for construction of offices, storage facilities and meeting rooms for
groups of 3-4 cooperatives the Project would provide, as part of Farm Service
Centers, offices for DCD staff as well as housing, vehicles and equipment.
The 2 provincial center staffs would include in each case 1 Director and
Directors of Audit, services and training with appropriate support staff. In
each district 3 cooperative officers would be responsible for organizing,
training, auditing and providing general support to about 8-12 Coops. Center
Directors would be equipped with 4x4 vehicles and district staff motorcycles.
The Project would train cooperative office bearers and members to efficiently
discharge their duties and responsibilities, and in the objectives and opera-
tion of cooperatives. A cooperative specialist would be appointed as part of
the foreign technical team with the main objective of training DCD agents.
Supervision of cooperatives and cooperative agents would be on a training and
visit system similar to that outlined for agricultural extension with which
close cooperation would be developed.
4.14      Rangeland Management and Survey - Experimental Range Improvement
Center (ERIC) (US$521,000). ERIC would be part of the Forestry and Range
Management Department. Objectives would include increasing knowledge of the
ecology, sociology, and economy of the project area rangelands; finding pro-
ductive species which could be established under prevailing conditions, and
devising appropriate management systems which would lead to increased range
productivity, reduced soil erosion, and improvement in the standard of living
of rangeland users; training staff on the role of the rangeland pastoral
system including its place in the total economy and relationship with and
effects on sedentary farming; and the preparation of a pilot range management
- rural development project suitable for donor financing and involving project
area rangeland users. A major objective would be, after appropriate survey
work, to establish one or more pilot nomad service centers which would provide
a focal point for nomad cooperative development and the provision of basic
services including veterinary, credit, marketing, extension, water, education
and health. The detailed plan of establishment would be reviewed by IDA
before implementation began.  Specific rangeland areas would be selected for
detailed survey including identification of the numbers and types of livestock
and people using the area, collecting data on livestock productivity and
monitoring changes overtime. Other activities would include random sample
measurement of annual dry matter production by total and months of main
species; establishing a monthly profile of main species consumed by types of
livestock; and measuring the effects of fire brush collection on rangeland
productivity and desertification. Buildings would include housing for senior



- 24 -
technicians, and a suitable office store and laboratory established on about
20 hectares where special adaption trials and production measurements could
be made. Staff would include two agronomists, a range management and live-
stock production expert and sociologist together with technicians and other
supporting staff. A foreign range management expert's main task would be to
establish an ERIC work program, train local specialists, advise on the continu-
ing program and assist with survey and trial data analysis and publication.
Local staff would undertake an initial one month training period with the IDA
assisted livestock development project based in Herat where the experimental
range improvement center has successfully illustrated the value of competent
range management staff.
4.15      Agricultural Credit (US$6.7 mil.).  Through the Agricutural Develop-
ment Bank (AgBank), the Project would improve access to and the use of credit
among farmers and cooperatives and non-farm rural enterprises, for short-term
productive inputs, and medium and long-tern for on-farm development, farm
machinery, water pumps, and livestock. Ag'Bank would also introduce loans
to cooperatives, on terms and conditions satisfactory to DRA and IDA, for
financing purchase of members produce and for construction of offices and
storage facilities. AgBank would open a branch office in Maidan, the center
of Wardak province, and, progressively, about five sub-branches in project
area main centers. Each sub-branch would be staffed with a qualified field
inspector together with necessary support staff. AgBank would upgrade its
Ghazni branch to a Type One which would initially give the branch Director
authority to approve loans of up to AF 50,000 (US$1,250) without prior head
office approval, and the loan approval authority of its Ghazni and Maidan
branch directors would be progressively increased. For short-term loans
(fertilizer and improved seed) a "pass book" system which allows firstly,
for individual short-term loans as opposed to groups of 5-10 with joint
and several liability and secondly, automatic eligibility for repeater loans
provided the pass book shows that the previous loan has been repaid, would
be introduced. Loan payment flexibility would be increased; farmers who
could show genuine reasons for non-payment would still be eligible for new
loans. Such loan recycling would be based upon AgBank staff appraisals.
4.16      AgBank, through its Supply Department, would expand and upgrade its
workshop and spare parts depot in Ghazni so as to offer satisfactory repair
and spare parts services to tractor and water pump owners. Spare parts for
water pumps presently owned by farmers, but which were not purchased through
AgBank Supply Department would also be stocked. AgBank would improve its
after-sales farm machinery service through the stationing in Ghazni of at
least 3 mobile workshops. Furthermore, as an innovative development, AgBank
would provide, during winter months, training courses for private village
repair workshop owners, to whom it would also provide on a wholesale basis, a
spare parts supply service. Credit would also be provided for private village
workshops for tools and spare parts inventory on terms and conditions satis-
factory to DRA and IDA.  Total loans over five years, would include about 100
shallow wells and pumpsets, 13,000 on-farm development, 80 non-farm rural
activities, and about 100 to cooperatives for working capital, offices and
storage facilities. Interest rates, loan repayments and security requirements
would be the same as for existing AgBank loans under the Third Agricultural



- 25 -
Credit Project (Credit 721-AF), except that cooperatives would qualify for a
1% per annum interest rebate for prompt loan payment. 1/ Investment costs
would include staff housing, a substantial workshop in Ghazni, and small
sub-branch offices which would be built by RDD-RPIU and transferred without
charge to AgBank.
4.17      Veterinary Services (US$2.9 mil.).  The veterinary component would
aim to extend services to village farmers and nomadic and transhumant pasto-
ralists through the establishment of a village veterinary service and the
strengthening of mobile vaccination teams. Control of major animal diseases
and parasites among participating flocks and herds including poultry, would be
expected to improve animal production, decrease mortality and increase annual
offtake. 2/ The Agricultural Extension Service supported by an animal produc-
tion specialist would give supporting advice on nutrition and husbandry, and
in order to provide reliable market outlets, the Herat Livestock Development
Corporation (HLDC) now engaged in mutton exporting, would establish a number
of buying points in the Project area. A fully equipped veterinary clinic now
being built in Ghazni town would be supported by about 5 sub-clinics estab-
lished in larger district farm service centers.
4.18       In order to reach out to the villages, a 'barefoot veterinarian'
approach would be adopted. The scheme would utilize the skills, knowledge,
and experience of villagers who would be trained as Village Veterinary Workers
(VVW), and as such would effectively extend the influence of the limited number
of trained personnel available. Three fully qualified veterinarians 3/ would
be appointed to supervise the service; two would be responsible for supervis-
ing about 16 Animal Health Assistants (AHA) stationed in sub-clinics; each
AHA would supervise about 8 VVW's; one VVW would cover six-eight villages or
roughly 3-400 families. 4/ One veterinarian would supervise the Ghazni clinic
and the mobile vaccinating teams. Regular in-service training would be a
feature. VVW's would undergo an initial one-month training in simple veter-
inary first aid including vaccination; be regularly supervised in the field at
least one day in each two weeks by the AHA; and would spend a minimum of one
day each month at an in-service training seminar conducted by the AHA and his
supervising veterinarian. At full development, about 30,000 families would
benefit, with annual livestock numbers treated of about 180,000 sheep, 60,000
goats, 60,000 cattle and 150,000 poultry. 4/ An important VVW task would be
educating farmer families in the advantages of preventive animal health
control, and relating the advantages of improved animal health, nutrition,
1/   Under existing AgBank loan conditions cooperatives pay 1% per annum
less than individual borrowers for all types of loans.
2/   Diseases involved include anthrax, clostridial group, pasteurellosis,
rinderpest, foot and mouth disease, fowl pox, new castle disease, sheep
pox, caprine pleuropneumonia, lice, ticks, liver fluke, and a range of
stomach worms.

and hygiene to the human situation. Thus the service could slowly become an
instrument for affecting change in attitudes towards these areas, particularly
among women and young children. Each sub-clinic would be equipped with a set
of simple veterinary equipment including a kerosene refrigerator. Each AHA
would have a motorcycle and each VVW a bicycle; DRA would examine the feasi-
bility of selling these vehicles to employees on a credit basis, with operat-
ing costs met by payment of a kilometer allowance sufficient to cover both
operating and maintenance costs and replacement. Veterinarians would be
provided with a 4-wheel drive vehicle. All senior staff down to the AHA level
would be provided with housing built by the project unit using local materials
and artisans, and designs which could be readily adapted to village use.
4.19      The costs of drugs and vaccines is estimated to cost about US$1.5
mil. or 75% of operating costs, thus illustrating the high cost of maintaining
an effective animal health program. Under the Project the full cost of drugs
and medicines , about $640,000, 1/ would be recovered. Presently vaccines
are provided free and if an effective national animal health control service
is eventually to be established, then the vaccine cost should be borne by
the users and not be a heavy drain on Government finances. DRA recognizes
this but feels that charging for vaccinations is presently impractical. By
March 31, 1980 DRA would complete a study undertaken by the Ministry of
Agriculture, assisted where applicable by project staff, which would incluide
recommendations for the introduction of vaccination and clinical service cost
recovery to be implemented not later than March 31, 1981.
4.20      Cadastral Survey (US$218,000).  The Project would assist the Carto-
graphic and Cadastral Survey Institute by supplying modern photogrammetric
equipment and operating materials, which would accelerate the progress of
reliable cadastral survey and registration of titles on irrigated land in the
project area. With the provision of one further orthophoto processing instru-
ment together with necessary operating materials the balance of the inten-
sively irrigated areas would be largely completed within five years. The
Institute has adequate trained staff to carry out the necessary orthophoto
survey and to operate the equipment, and will complete the survey of main
irrigated areas in the Project area by June 30, 1983.
(ii) Rural Infrastructure
4.21      Minor Road Improvement (US$7.6 million).  The Project would establish
within RDD-RPIU two road construction teams equipped with equipment necessary
to upgrade minor roads (Annex 1, Chart 3). Over five years about 400 km of
minor roads would be upgraded to reasonable all-weather standard. Apart from
the main highway and a few more important secondary roads, many project area
roads are closed for up to five months each year due to effects of floods,
snow, and inadequate maintenance. Traffic counts indicate average daily
traffic (ADT) of between 10 to 50 although much uncertainty is attached to

these conservative figures. Traffic composition includes 40% trucks, 30%
buses, and the balance taxis and private cars. Trucks are generally 6-ton
capacity and buses have seating capacity of between 20 and 30. Trade is
mainly directed to Ghazni or Kabul, the business, marketing and administrative
centers.
4.22      Present road horizontal and vertical alignment is generally poor.
Earth works are provided only in very difficult topographic conditions and
roads usually run at the same level of surrounding terrain, thus being sub-
ject to water logging during rains or melting snow. Culverts and permanent
crossings of dry washes are lacking and bridges are provided only on permanent
rivers. In cultivated areas, roads frequently cross irrigation canals without
culverts or bridges. Project works would raise embankments in poorly drained
areas excavate drainage ditches and construct culverts; vertical and horizontal
alignment would be improved; and bridges for river crossings would be provided
only where major floods are expected to occur. Where floods occur only a few
days each year Irish bridges would be constructed. The design standards to
be followed correspond to those established by Ministry of Public Works for
Category C (secondary road) and Category D (tertiary roads). Where ADT is
less than 50, design speed would be 45 km/hr, carriage way 7.5 meters, and
gravel surface 5.5 meters. For ADT less than 25, design speed would be 30
km/hr, carriage way 5 meters, and gravel surface 3.5 meters. Present average
traffic speed on most unimproved roads would be 10-20 km/hr.
4.23      Roads have not yet been identified and would be subject to detailed
survey and design before being selected for upgrading. The first three
appraisals by RDD-RPIU would be sent to IDA for comment and review prior to
work commencing. Selection criteria would include ADT, land area and popula-
tion served for each kilometer, estimated changes in traffic volume as a
consequence of upgrading, and the socio-economic impact of road improvement
in the influence zone. Detailed appraisal and selection methodology are shown
in Project File working paper C-10. Road selection would also take into
account the main Government administrative centers (Woleswalis) and reinforce-
ment of those roads which would give the shortest connections between popula-
tion and administrative centers, the main Kabul-Kandahar road and Provincial
capitals. Full account would be taken of Project phasing including the need
for access to cultivated areas in order to extend services such as veterinary,
extension, credit and cooperatives. Every endeavour would be made to ensure
that the work brought benefits to the maximum number of people particularly
those in more remote poorer areas. Linking of villages to better quality
existing roads would be a particular concern. In many cases villages are
isolated from more important roads for much of the year. Improvement costs
to tertiary road standard have been roughly estimated to about Af 400,000
(US$10,000) per kilometer. This cost includes a substantial labor input.
Construction is expected to commence in project year two with year one being
used mainly for equipment procurement, training of construction units and
survey and design leading to identification of road priority. Road main-
tenance would be the continuing responsibility of RDD-RPIU or the Ministry of
Public Works Road Construction and Maintenance Department (secondary roads)
both during and following project implementation. An innovative maintenance
measure to be introduced by RDD-RPIU would be the employment of local 'road-
men', each equipped with a wheelbarrow, shovel and bicycle and who would be
responsible for continuing minor maintenance of between 4 and 6 km each.



- 28 -
4.24       Village Water Supplies (US$1.5 million).  About 100 villages would
benefit from the installation of pollution free reliable domestic water
supply. Some 5-8,000 families including 50--60,000 persons would come within
the resulting influence zone. Domestic water use by the majority of villages
is polluted to varying degrees, either at the source or during distribution.
The Project water supply program would be in addition to a UNICEF supported
Environmental Health Department (EHD) 1/ program in the two provinces which
has identified about 120 village water supply schemes largely oriented towards
schools, health centers, and hospitals. A UNICEF/RDD program includes a
further 50 schemes to be implemented in Katawaz Loi Woleswali of Ghazni prov-
ince. During the next five years the RDD program is expected to be completed
and about twenty of the UNICEF/EHD projects.  About 100 potential additional
schemes have already been identified but these would be subject to individual
appraisal, survey and design by RDD-RPIU before final selection. Actual
siting of the distribution system, including community taps, would be done by
the RDD-RPIU design team in conjunction with the appropriate village authori-
ties. The first three appraisals including design details, would be sent to
IDA for review and comment prior to work commencing.
4.25       The systems to be installed would include hand dug wells, shallow
tube wells, and springs. Factors to be considered in system selection would
include replicability in terms of construction methods and the availability
of materials, pollution prevention, amount of supervision required, ease of
maintenance and resistance to damage, and convenience of use. Criteria
for village selection would include the degree of pollution and access to
existing water supply sources; the potential number and economic and health
status of beneficiaries; the agreement of the Village Development Council to
be responsible for operation and maintenance cost and where practicable, to
provide the unskilled labor required for installation; and agreement of the
village to nominate at least two persons with adequate qualifications to
undergo EHD Village Health Worker training. An outline of appraisal informa-
tion required for selection is shown in Project File working paper C-11. This
appraisal procedure would be followed and the first three such appraisals
would first be submitted to IDA for reviewt and comment before work commenced.
In most cases, the pollution free water supply would be less convenient to
families than existing supplies and without a supporting eduction program,
benefits would not be maximized. As a condition of sub-project approval the
village would agree to establish an instit:ution, with a person such as a water
bailiff in charge, for supervising operation and maintenance. 2/  Technical
advice and maintenance training would be provided through RPIU. The Project
would establish within RPIU a Village water supply unit with adequate equip-
ment including a drilling rig and transport, to enable it to adequately survey,
1/   Responsibility for village water supply installations, other than those
undertaken by RDD and under the Project, is now to be undertaken by a
new Department in the Ministry of Public Works.
2/   Presently all villages have such 'institutions' to handle irrigation net-
works; the system could be easily adapted for domestic water supply.

design, and install satisfactory water supply systems (Annex 1, Chart 3).
Technical advice and cooperation would be available from EHD and UNICEF with
which organizations RDD already has a close and functional relationship. Each
system is expected to cost in the vicinity of Af 6,000 (US$1,500).
(iii) Project Planning, Coordination and Evaluation
and Technical Assistance
4.26      Regional Planning and Implemention Unit (RPIU) (US$3.2 million).
A Rural Development Department (RDD) RPIU would be established with head-
quarters in Ghazni. RPIU would advise the Provincial Rural Development
Councils (PRDCs) 1/ on agricultural and rural development programs and proj-
ects, including preparation of annual cost estimates; act as a secretariat
to PRDC; monitor program and project implementation and advise PRDC on its
current status; strengthen and improve local administrative and management
procedures; and so as to ensure the people's participation in and understand-
ing of the development programs, assist with the formation of village devel-
opment councils. RPIU would implement the Rural Development Departments
existing functions namely road construction, minor irrigation rehabilitation,
and village water supply improvement. It would be equipped with adequate
workshops, equipment, offices, and staff, to undertake all project building
construction including staff housing, repair and maintenance of all project
vehicles and equipment, and buildings. An important function would be to test
new design and construction techniques particularly for housing, adapted to
local conditions and functions, and suitable for use by local artisans using
local materials. RPIU would also be responsible for procurement both local
and international, of all vehicles, equipment, spares, buildings and operat-
ing stores and materials. It would maintain adequate stores under inventory
control systems adapted to local procedures which provided for prompt and
timely delivery to operational units. A public relations unit would stimu-
late public interest and participation in the development process in general
and the Project in particular. RPIU would establish systems for evaluating
project impact on crop yields, animal production, area cultivated, cropping
pattern, irrigation, water utilization, farmer income and standard of living,
human health, and social changes; and on staff quality, operational efficiency,
and institutional development.
2/
4.27      Technical Assistance and Overseas Training (US$4.9- million).  The
Project would employ 12 foreign experts for 324 manmonths, including 32 man-
months of unspecified short-term consultants. Except for the project leader,
1/   Due to very recent changes PRDC's would be formed for Ghazni and the
Project areas of Kabul and Paktika provinces.
2/   Includes Technical Assistance and Fellowship Training (US$3.6 million)
(Annex 1, Table 4), and Feasibility Study costs (US$1.3 million).

accountant administrator, and senior engineer, who would each serve for three
to five years, experts would be employed for an initial 12 to 24 month term
following which additional responsibilities would be entrusted to their Afghan
counterparts who would have been suitably trained in this period; thereafter
the experts would pay only short term visits as required. In view of the
number of experts required and the need to ensure their prompt availability
and continuity, their recruitment would be made through an international con-
sulting firm. Their prime tasks would include training, the preparation of
work programs, advising on technology, and preparing job specification and
responsibilities. The technical assistance team would include a training
officer who would coordinate training for all project components including
farmer training. In addition to suitable ecluipment provided under each
component, training would be assisted by the establishment under the Fourth
IDA assisted Education Project of a regional extension training center in
Ghazni and about 25 village farmer training centers throughout the two prov-
inces. The Project would also provide 205 rnanmonths of overseas fellowship
training. Emphasis would be on short-term three to four month fellowships
including both professional and technical training. Wherever possible fellow-
ships would be in developing countries where the technology and conditions are
more appropriate. Consulting service costs include salaries, travel, family
benefits, firm overhead, management fee, and the backup support. The cost of
feasibility studies for irrigation dams on the Ghazni river is estimated at
US$932,000; 1/ and consulting services to assist with preparation of a second
rural development project US$409,000. 1/  Consultant service costs, including
salary, travel, allowances, firm overhead and management have been estimated
to average about US$8,000 per man month (base cost).
E. Cost Estimates
4.28      Project cost estimates are based on prices prevailing during
appraisal (June/July 1978) updated in January 1979 and are net of duties and
taxes, since no taxes are levied on IDA-assisted projects. The total project
cost, including physical and price contingencies is estimated at Af 1,561
million (US$39 million) of which 45% would be the foreign exchange. Physical
contingency of 20% on civil works and 10% on buildings and average price
contingencies of 20% 2/ on base cost plus physical contingencies have been
included in the total cost estimate. Actual works for minor irrigation
1/   Consultants (local and international) would be recruited separately from
those hired to provide technical assistance.
2/   The following annual inflation rates (%) were applied for price contin-
gencies:

rehabilitation, road improvement and village water supplies would be identi-
fied and appraised as project implementation proceeds. Costs have been based
on estimates of typical civil works, many of which are being undertaken by
RDD or other Departments on an on-going basis, and what might be reasonably
implemented within the five years, given much expanded resources in staff,
equipment and vehicles, and finance. Summary of cost estimates is given in
Table 2 page 32. Detailed costs for individual components are presented in
the Project File.
F. Financing
4.29      Financing of total project costs of Af 1,561 million (US$39.0
million) would be provided in the following proportions:
US$ Mil.          %
IDA                        16.5            42
IFAD                       13.0            33
UNDP                        1.0             3
DRA                         5.8            15
AgBank                      1.1             3
Beneficiaries /1            1.6             4
Total                39.0            100
/1   Includes AgBank sub-borrowers $0.9 mil. and
veterinary beneficiaries (drug costs) $0.7.
Further details are shown in Annex 1, Tables 2-3. The proposed IDA credit of
US$16.5 million would be made to DRA on standard terms. The IFAD loan of
US$13 million would be on standard terms except that US$0.5 million would be
a grant for technical assistance in project implementation. UNDP would cover
part of the cost of technical assistance and overseas fellowships under a
UNDP/DRA/IDA project for which IBRD would be the executing agency for UNDP.
Completion of a satisfactory project document would be a condition of project
effectiveness. AgBank's contribution of US$1.1 million would cover 16% of
the estimated credit component cost. Farmers and cooperatives receving medium
and long-term loans would contribute cash representing 20% of the investment
costs.  The balance of the project cost would be financed by DRA.  The Govern-
ment would be the Borrower, and bear the foreign exchange risk. It would
on-lend to AgBank about US$4.5 million, representing about 66% of the total
credit component cost 1/ (total US$6.7 million) at 4.5% interest repayable
1/   Of total component cost of US$6.7 million (including price contingencies)
AgBank would contribute US$1.1 million, sub-borrowers US$0.9 million,
IDA and IFAD US$4.7 million.

over 15 years including five years grace.  These terms and conditions would be
reflected in a subsidiary agreement between DRA and AgBank, and are the same
as those used in the Third Agricultural Credit Project (721-AF). Completion
of a subsidiary agreement satisfactory to IDA would be a condition of project
effectiveness.
G. Procurement
4.30       Contracts of US$100,000 or more for purchase of vehicles and equip-
ment (US$6.1 1/ million) would be awarded on the basis of International Com-
petitive Bidding (ICB), in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. Domestic
manufacturers would be granted a preferential margin in bid evaluation equal
to the prevailing tariff, or 15% of the c.i.f. cost of imports, whichever
is the lower. All other purchases would be made in accordance with local
procurement procedures which would result in reasonable prices. The RDD-
RPIU President would be authorized to approve contracts of up to Af 500,000
(US$12,500) without first having to obtain further approval and to make
purchases of up to Af 20,000 ($500) without the use of a purchasing committee;
local purchases made by bidding would be sealed and in writing only and once
bids have been satisfactorily evaluated they would not be readvertised. With
these modifications local procurement procedures would be satisfactory to IDA
and appropriate assurances that authorization for such procedures would be
included in the RPIU empowering charter were obtained during negotiations.
Contracts for building construction and civil works (total US$9.3 mil) would
be generally for small works, of varied design and geographically scattered.
Thus they would not be appropriate for procurement under ICB. Such construc-
tion would be carried out by contractors selected through local competitive
bidding or by construction units of RDD-RPIU. All investment procurement
involving project funds would be undertaken by the RDD RPIU. Appropriate
staffing and storage facilities would be provided so as to allow adequate
storage of spare parts, building materials and operating stores.
H. Disbursements
4.31      The IDA/IFAD credits would be disbursed, net of taxes as follows:
(a)  100% of total expenditures for civil works and buildings
(US$9.3 million);
(b)  100% of c.i.f. value of directly imported vehicles and
equipment (US$5.8 million);
(c)  85% of cost of locally purchased imported vehicles,
equipment and materials and 100% of ex-factory cost of
locally manufactured vehicles, equipment and materials
(US$0.3 million);
1/   Staff housing, buildings, vehicles, and equipment to be Project financed
are shown in Table 7, Annex 1.



- 34 -
(d) 100% of expenditure for dam feasibility study ((US$0.9
million) IDA only);
(e)  100% of expenditure for feasibility study for Rural
Development II ((US$0.4 million) IDA only);
(f) 80% of sub-loans for wells and pumlps, cooperative storage,
village workshops and on-farm development disbursed by
AgBank (US$2.7 million);
(g)  70% of sub-loans for fertilizer and seeds disbursed by AgBank
during the first year of the project and thereafter 70% of
the annual incremental disbursemenits (US$1.8 million);
(h)  72% 1/ of total expenditure of technical assistance and
training (US$2.6 million); and
(i) 60% of (i) local staff salaries incremental to those committed
on March 21, 1979 (US$4.1 million); (ii) vehicle operation and
maintenance (US$3.3 million); and (iii) RPIU operating and
maintenance costs (US$2.7 million).
The estimated schedule of disbursements (Annex 1, Table 8) indicates comple-
tion over six years. For categories (f), (g) and (i) disbursements would be
made against statements of expenditures, and supporting documents would be
retained by AgBank for inspection by IDA Project Review Missions. Assurances
have been obtained that AgBank would keep separate accounts fo the credit
component for various types of loans made under the project.
I. Accounts andl Audit
4.32      Funds for project investments, all project vehicle operating costs,
RDD-RPIU operating costs and for that proportion of local staff salaries to be
financed by IDA/IFAD (para 4.31(i)) would be channelled from the Ministry of
Finance to an account already established with the Da Afghanistan Bank. RDD-
RPIU President would operate the account. Except for the credit component,
RDD-RPIU would maintain accounts of project funds handled by it in accordance
with appropriate accounting practices. Funds for operating costs, excepting
vehicle and equipment and RPIU operation and maintenance, but including that
proportion of local staff salaries funded by DRA would be channelled through
the Ministry of Finance to the respective ministry in the normal manner. Each
concerned Government ministry and agency receive annual budgets and maintain
1/   The remaining 28% would be financed by UNDP; US$2.6 million includes an
IFAD grant (US$0.5 million) to be disbursed for the foreign exchange
costs of specialists in monitoring arnd evaluation, cooperatives, and
extension, and training fellowships for extension workers.

proper accounts which are then audited.  However the auditing program is
usually well behind schedule, a factor contributing to administrative bottle-
necks. Furthermore, in order to improve project implementation capacity
relating to local financial procedures the RDD-RPIU annual budgets would be
prepared on both a program basis (i.e. by cost of project) and the present
line item system.  RPIU would be responsible for operation and maintenance
of all vehicles, equipment and buildings including issuing of fuel, and would
maintain separate appropriate cost accounts. The Bank account has initially
been funded more than three months in advance of RPIU's requirements and the
RDD-RPIU President would have authority to operate on this account without
further reference to higher authority and within the limits only of the
already approved budget. The Bank account would then be reimbursed on a three
monthly basis by the Ministry of Finance. Assurances to this effect were
obtained during negotiations. RDD-RPIU would have financial records pertain-
ing to project funds for which they would keep separate accounts, audited
annually by qualified independent auditors acceptable to IDA and submit such
audited records to IDA and IFAD for review and comment within five months of
the close of each Afghan fiscal year. The auditors report would include an
opinion on whether or not the funds have been used for the purpose for which
they are provided. AgBank would be responsible for the disbursement and
implementation of the credit component. AgBank would maintain separate
accounts for subloans under the project and (a) have such records for each
fiscal year audited in accordance with appropriate auditing principles by
independent auditors acceptable to IDA; (b) furnish to IDA within five months
of the end of each fiscal year: (i) certified copies of audited financial
statements and (ii) the auditors report; and (c) furnish to IDA such other
information concerning the accounts, financial statements and the audit as IDA
may request. Accounting procedures to enable satisfactory use of Statement of
Expenditure procedures are either now operational or would be established.
Further details are shown in Annex 2.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT 1/
A. Introduction
5.01      The proposals for organization and management have been made on the
basis that DRA wishes to decentralize and ultimately regionalize, agricultural
and rural development, concentrate resources for this development in a few
selected regions, avoid duplication by agencies and departments, improve imple-
mentation capacity at the regional/provincial level, and give RDD a major
role in regional development planning, coordination and implementation. The
project would largely maintain existing organizational structures of various
1/   Chart I page 37, illustrates the proposed organization and management
outline; Chart 2, Annex 1, sets out the existing Government Organization.



- 36 -
departments (mainly Agriculture and RDD) in the concerned provincial adminis-
trations, and would strengthen the concerned departments to enable them to
implement the project and, in future, other agricultural and rural develop-
ment programs. The project would utilize existing staff and endow them with
active and meaningful roles and sufficient resources and additional staff,
thus rendering productive an important but presently underutilized resource.
As an innovative measure designed to strengthen planning, implementation and
coordination at the provincial level, the project would establish within RDD a
regional planning and implementation unit in Ghazni which would also provide
the critical liaison and coordination between the provincial administrations.
By focusing on the institutional limitations and opportunities of provincial
administrations, the project would help to improve the Government's capacity
to implement development programs both present and future in the provinces
concerned. Furthermore the organization and management proposed would be seen
as a pilot operation with the objective of deriving lessons which could be
used in future regional and rural development programs in other provinces of
Afghanistan.
B. Rural Development Department - Regional Planning and
Implementation Unit (RDD-RPIU)
5.02      In Ghazni a RDD-RPIU with a President, two Vice-Presidents, three
General Directorates (Engineering Survey and Design, Construction, Administra-
tion) and relevant technical staff would be established (Annex 1, Chart 3).
RPIU would have both a staff and line function. The President would also
act as Chairman of the Provincial Rural Development Councils (PRDC) of
Ghazni, Kabul and Paktika. In planning, administration and management, RPIU
would advise PRDCs on regional agricultural and rural development programs
and projects, including preparation of annual cost estimates and work plans.
Additional objectives would include strengthening and improving local adminis-
trative and management procedures and assisting PRDC with the formation of
appropriate village organizations so as to ensure the people's fullest
participation in the Project.
5.03      Line functions would include completion of the proposed project
building program including staff houses for all project components and all
other project civil works. As Government procedures for building and civil
works construction are time consuming and in the long run probably very
costly, RPIU would have full authority to employ contractors to undertake
such work. In order to improve operational procedures, implementing capacity,
and provide ultimately for improved monitoring of project cost, RDD-RPIU would
be empowered to introduce a number of innovative administrative procedures
including recruitment of local personnel, fixing local wage rates, introducing
improved warehouse inventory control systems, and administering amended local
procurement regulations. Assurances to this effect were obtained during
negotiations. Through a public relations directorate, RPIU would stimulate
public interest in the project. A key function would be monitoring project
implementation and establishing systems for evaluating project impact on

agricultural and livestock production, social changes, staff quality, and
institutional development. Monitoring and evaluation would be used as a
management tool and as a basis for development planning. RPIU President would
not have direct authority over other Government Department officers, but would
advise PRDC on project implementation status and where appropriate recommend
steps necessary to bring about changes or performance improvement.
C. Provincial Rural Development Councils
5.04      The existing Provincial Rural Development Committees would be
formally constituted Provincial Rural Development Councils (PRDC). 1/ PRDC
responsibilities, satisfactory to IDA, would be established. Overall agricul-
tural and rural development policy would be rmade by the Presidents Council for
Coordination of Rural Development (PCCRD) in Kabul within the framework of
overall DRA agricultural sector policy. PCCRD would also approve annual work
programs before final recommendation to Cabinet through the Ministries of
Planning and Finance. Kabul, Paktika and Ghazni PRDCs would each be Chaired
by the President of RDD-RPIU. Other members, each with equal voting power
would include the respective Governors, representatives of Government depart-
ments and agencies 2/, including the Planning Ministry, and the people. The
provincial Director General of Agriculture would be Vice-Chairman. Each PRDC
would have a small Executive Council responsible for day-to-day decision
making. PRDC would be linked to districts through District Development
Committees (DDC) chaired by the sub-Governor concerned. DDCs would have
direct linkage with Village Development Councils, the chairmen of whom would
be members of each concerned DDC. Cooperative chairmen would also be members.
PRDCs would be responsible for approving annual development projects, programs
and budgets (prepared by RDD-RPIU) to be sent to RDD and PCCRD and ultimately
the Planning and Finance Ministries; providing the body through which the
people's development wishes can be reflected in these approved programs; and
providing the executive authority, at the provincial level, for ensuring
project implementation by the participating agencies and departments. Estab-
lishment of the Ghazni PRDC would be a condition of credit effectiveness.
D. Project Implementation
5.05      The Project would be implemented largely by the Ministry of Agricul-
ture, RDD, and AgBank, through existing Provincial organizations and agencies
which would be strengthened with additional resources and funding as required.
Apart from the range management, research and the proposed RPIU planning,
1/   Chart I page 37.  Chart 2, Annex 1 illustrates present Government
organization.
2/   These would include the 2 RDD-RPIU vice-presidents, Director General of
AgBank, Agriculture, AgBank Director and others as required.



- 39 -
monitoring, public relations, and workshop activities, all project components
would be an expansion of ongoing programs. Chart 5, Annex 1 indicates an
Estimated Schedule of Project Implementation. As the project has important
implications for future Rural Development Programs and a number of innovative
organization and management features, DRA and IDA/IFAD would jointly undertake
a mid-term review of the progress made by the project and the lessons learnt
by not later than 3 years after the proposed credit signature date. Assur-
ances to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
5.06      Organizational arrangements to implement each component would be as
follows: Minor Irrigation Rehabilitation, Minor Road Improvement and Village
Water Supply would be implemented by RDD through units established within
RDD-RPIU (Chart 3, Annex 1). These activities would be a major expansion of
ongoing RDD programs in the project area. EHD or RDD would implement the
appropriate village education programs in both health (EHD) and pump operation
and maintenance (RDD). In addition to finalizing appraisals, RDD-RPIU would
carry out construction works including light drilling, and provide backup
technical support to villages where improved supplies are installed. WAPM
would provide technical guidance, undertake drilling and well testing and
development in cases where deep drilling is considered the most appropriate.
The village water supply component would be a major expansion of RDD ongoing
or proposed activities in the project area. AgBank would implement the credit
activities, provide after sales service for farm machinery and water pumps,
establish training programs for farmers and village workshop artisans.
5.07      The Ministry of Agriculture Departments of Veterinary Services and
Animal Production, Agricultural Extension and Development, Forestry and Range
Management, Research, and Cooperative Development would implement the veteri-
nary, extension, range management, research, and cooperative components,
respectively. The provincial staff would be administratively responsible to
their respective PRDC and technically responsible, as at present, to their
respective head offices in Kabul. Provincial staff would be required to
report on project implementation progress to RDD-RPIU which would be respon-
sible for project monitoring. They would also submit annual provincial
development proposals in their respective fields, to RDD-RPIU for inclusion
in the annual Provincial Development Budget and work program submitted to
PRDC for approval. Cadastral survey implementation would represent an
expansion of ACCSI's ongoing activities in the two provinces. WAPM would
recruit and supervise in consultation with RDD-RPIU, under terms of reference
agreed upon by DRA and IDA, consultants to undertake feasibility studies for
storage increase of Bande Seraj Dam and the construction of a new dam upstream
of Bande Seraj. WAPM would continue to be responsible for the management of
Bande Seraj water storage management which under the Project, would be done in
accordance with a policy agreement between WAPM, PRDC, and RDD-RPIU. RDD-RPIU
would recruit and supervise, under terms of reference agreed upon by DRA and
IDA, consultants for preparing a second Rural Development Project in an area
yet to be selected.
5.08      Government Department and Agency head offices in Kabul would
continue to play an important role in project implementation through the



- 40 -
Presidents Council for Coordination of Rural Development (PCCRD) 1/ (Annex I,
Chart 2) and through the technical supervision of their provincial subor-
dinates. PCCRD would be required to meet on a regular quarterly basis, such
meetings coinciding with the production of RDD-RPIU's quarterly progress
reports, which would form the basis of discussion. The powers and respon-
sibilities of PCCRD would be satisfactory to IDA and IFAD. The establishment
of the PCCRD would be a condition of credit effectiveness.
5.09      Staffing Equipment, Vehicles and Housing.  Total incremental staff 2/
to be appointed under the project would include 8 senior staff above the Rank
of III, 77 professionals in the Rank III - V, and 192 including 65 extension
agents in the Rank VI - IX. Clerks, drivers and laboratory assistants would
total 97, minor operating staff 150, and village veterinary workers 130. The
project would provide housing for most of the existing and incremental staff
free of charge. Table 7, Annex I summarizes the staff housing, vehicles and
equipment to be financed under the project.
E. Training
5.10      A key project function would include professional, technical and
farmer training. A prime responsibility of foreign experts would be train-
ing of Afghan staff in their respective technical fields as well as prepara-
tion of appropriate programs, job descriptions and responsibilities. A
minimum of 24 mandays of annual in-service training would be provided to each
extension agent and his supervisor. Similar training would be provided for
veterinary staff including animal health assistants and village veterinary
workers and vaccinators, and Cooperative agents and supervisors. The RDD-RPIU
would be assisted by a project leader, who would be a suitably qualified
agriculturalist and would be experienced in organization and management of
similar multi-sectoral development projects, an accountant-administrator, and
a senior engineer for a total of 11.3 manyears. RPIU would also be supported
for 20 manmonths by an automotive engineer the responsibility of whom would
include organizing intensive in-service training and job specifications for
Afghan staff.  In order to coordinate training activities and to ensure proper
training of Afghan trainers a specialist training officer would be appointed
for a period of 12 months. Annex 1, Table 4 shows details of Technical Assis-
tance cost estimates, and Annex 1 Chart 5 the Project Implementation Schedule.
1/   PCCRD would be Chaired by RDD President; membership would include the
Presidents of Extension, Veterinary, Cooperatives, Planning (Ministry
Planning)  RDD-RPIU (Ghazni-Wardak) and others as required.
2/   For appraisal purposes, including the preparation of all component
costs only incremental staff considered necessary to implement the Project
have been included; staff on station at March 21, 1979 in all concerned
departments and agencies operating in the Project area would be absorbed
into the Project; IDA/IFAD would disburse for 60% of incremental staff
costs (para 4.31(i)).



- 41 -
5.11      In technical fields related to irrigation including operation and
maintenance of equipment, irrigation works and concrete production, 20 man-
months of overseas training would be provided. Similarly 58 manmonths of
overseas training including 1 postgraduate study period is included for
veterinary services. Each village veterinary worker would undergo a four-
week introductory program before being admitted to the village veterinary
service. Animal health assistants would also undergo similar introductory
training. Initially such training would be conducted at the RDD-RPIU head-
quarters, but later at the Ghazni Regional Training Center to be constructed
under the forthcoming Fourth IDA-assisted Education Project. Range management
and survey Experimental Range Improvement Center (ERIC) staff would receive
28 manmonths of overseas training including one 18-month postgraduate fellow-
ship. Technicians and professionals attached to ERIC would undergo a 4-week
introductory training period with the IDA assisted HLDC Experimental Range
Improvement Center where a small cadre of competent range management staff has
been built up. Ten manmonths of technical type overseas training would be
provided for technicians in the village water supply component. Agricultural
extension would include 40 manmonths of overseas training for Directors,
Supervisors and Subject Matter Specialists. Overseas training totaling 205
manmonths (US$0.4 mil.) would focus upon visits to appropriate and relevant
institutions and projects largely in developing countries.
5.12      Training would be assisted by the construction in Ghazni of a
regional extension training center under the proposed IDA assisted Fourth
Education Project. The Education Project would establish 25 farmer village
training centers in the two provinces. These training centers would be used
extensively for both project staff and farmer training, which would include
not only relevant agricultural technology but education in health, pump, and
farm machinery maintenance. Due to climatic conditions activities in most of
the Project area must be curtailed during winter. During these four months
project management would ensure that a maximum amount of training and retrain-
ing was undertaken at all levels.
F. Monitoring and Evaluation
5.13      Monitoring project implementation progress and evaluating its impact
on institutions and rural society would be an important function of the RDD-
RPIU. A Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (MEU) adequately staffed and equipped
would be set up under the Vice-President of Planning and Coordination. 1/ An
internationally recruited expert would initially assist MEU to establish a
1/   Annex 1, Chart 3.



- 42 -
program for data gathering including base line survey work, and subsequently
with data evaluation. The MEU objective would be firstly to evaluate the
project's progress towards achieving its objectives, secondly to assist with
solving implementation problems, and thirdly to ensure against high risks by
establishing a unit with capability to analyze problems and help management
find solutions on an ongoing basis. Having established a satisfactory data
gathering system which would be as simple as possible, the MEU would evaluate
the project impact not only on agricultural productivity, but on the standard
of living and well being of rural society in affected zones. An attempt would
be made to use monitoring and evaluation as a management tool. The informa-
tion would be used not only by RPIU but by PRDC and ultimately by DRA and IDA/
IFAD. Early establishment and successful operation of the proposed unit would
be essential in providing sufficient data so as to ensure a proper evaluation
of project progress and impact at the time of the project's mid-term review.
RPIU would be required to report to DRA through the RDD President and to IDA/
IFAD on a quarterly basis on the progress of project implementation and the
resulting impact. A set of project key objectives and indicators which would
form the basis of quarterly reports is set out in Chart 1, Annex 1.  The proj-
ect provides for the staff, office facilit-ies, equipment and back-up consult-
ing services for MEU as part of RDD-RPIU. MEU would be responsible for
completion, not later than six months from the project completion date, of a
Project Completion report which would include an overall evaluation of project
impact on the rural economy, farmers incomtes and living standards, social
changes, and institution building. Excluding separate AgBank monitoring and
evaluation, the cost of MEU over 5 years is estimated at AF 6.0 million
(US$150,000) excluding technical assistance costs.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Targeted Beneficiaries and Financial Analysis
6.01      The proposed project would benefit one of the least developed
regions of Afghanistan. An estimated 60% of the project area population lives
in absolute poverty with income levels of AF 3,400 (US$85) or less. With the
project the average income of the beneficiaries would increase by about 70%,
but 52% of the project participants owning an average farm size of 0.8 ha
would still remain below the absolute poverty income level, thus highlighting
the rural poverty problem and the need for land consolidation and reform and
generation of non-farm rural employment opportunities. I/ The project would
improve family income and standards of living, by increasing crop and live-
stock production throughout most of the two provinces basically through (a)
improvement and rehabilitation of minor irrigation schemes serving about
1/   Land Reform is planned for completion by mid 1980; many holders of 0.8 ha
of 1st grade land would be increased to 1.0 ha particularly in Ghazni;
in Wardak the shortage of irrigable land will result in many farms remain-
ing below 1.0 ha in area.



- 43 -
17,000 ha; (b) provision of agricultural extension services over most of the
irrigated (90,000 ha) areas, which would be backed up by adaptative research
in the fields of land and water use for crops grown in the project area; and
(c) provision of veterinary services and extension of animal production tech-
nology. All other project components contribute towards this goal either in
a minor way or indirectly.
6.02      Quantifiable benefits from the proposed project would accrue
to about 62,000 farm families; about 40% of the Project area population.
Families participating in the village veterinary program would total about
30,000 of whom perhaps 10,000 would be incremental to those served by agri-
cultural credit and extension programs (48,000) under the Project. In addi-
tion, about 3,000 to 4,000 nomad and transhumant families would benefit
from the veterinary program. At least an additional 100,000 people would
indirectly benefit from the village water supply and road components and
the general economic activity generated by the Project. About 13,000 farm
families, of whom about 63% are estimated to be below the poverty income level
would be the direct primary beneficiaries from the total agricultural package
including rehabilitation of irrigation systems, development of shallow wells,
agricultural credit, and extension. About 54% of the incremental net bene-
fits would accrue to the target group. To demonstrate the projected finan-
cial benefits, the following farm models have been selected as typically
representative; these are based on expected cropping patterns and adoption of
a technical input package 1/ (Annex 1 Table 6).
6.03      Model:  Fertilizer and Seed (0.8 ha).  In the river valley upper
reaches and side valleys, farms are highly fragmented and average size is
about 0.8 ha. The impact of using fertilizer and improved seed combined with
a secured water supply for wheat, would result in average net operating per
capita income increasing from the present AF 1,120 (US$28) to AF 1720 (US$43)
including on-farm wheat consumption, which would increase from about 72 kg to
118 kg per capita over four years. About 6,750 farm families (average family
size of 9) would be represented by this farm model. Additional labor require-
ments would be met by family labor which is currently under employed due to
family size relative to land farmed. The financial rate of return (FRR) of
this model is over 100% after allowing for a 1-1/2% per annum increase in
wheat and potatoes for four years 'without' the Project.
6.04      Model:  Oxen and Farm Implements (2 ha.).  The model illustrates the
impact of fertilizers, improved seed and investment in oxen and implements on
a 2 ha farm. Net per capita income, including on-farm consumption, would
increase over four years from AF 4,560 (US$114) to AF 5,600 (US$140). Due to
shortage of family labor during peak periods on this larger farm, about 52 man
days would be hired for weeding, harvesting and threshing. The FRR, after
allowing for 'without' project increases in wheat and potato production over
four years, is estimated at 45%.
1/   Details of the technical package are shown in Project File Working
Paper C-6. 1



- 44 -
6.05      Model:  Orchard and Farm Improvements (3 ha).  In the lower reaches
of Ghazni river water scarcity becomes more acute and about 25% of farm lands
are annually left fallow. Project beneficiaries under this category would
receive credit for orchard, oxen and farm implement investments, and through
proper regulation of Bande Seraj Dam and construction of permanent diversion
weirs and intakes, 0.9 hectare presently fallowed annually, would become fully
productive. Consequently, net per capita income including on-farm consumption,
would increase from AF 2,100 (US$53) to AF 5,000 (US$125) in year five and AF
9,700 (US$243) in the year ten when the apple trees reach full production.
The estimated FRR, after allowing for four years 'without' project increases
is over 100%.
6.06      Model:  Shallow Well (4.0 ha).  This model represents a joint venture
of four farm families each owning 4 ha. Cost of shallow well and pumpset (AF
48,000 (US$1,200)) is financed 80% by AgBank and 20% by the beneficiaries.
Present 4 hectare farm income is estimated at about AF 18,000 (AF 2,000 or
US$50 per capita) including on-farm consumption. With the project, net family
income would increase by 85% over 5 years to AF 33,400 (Af 3,700 or US$93 per
capita) inclusive of wheat and by-products consumed on-farm. The FRR, after
allowing for 'without' project wheat production increases for five years, is
estimated at 20%. Summary of financial results of the four representative
models is shown in Annex 1, Table 6.   Details on technical assumptions, yield
increases, cropping pattern are given Working Paper C-6 of the Project File.
6.07       For livestock, benefits have been estimated on the likely changes
in key productive coefficients resulting from adoption of a prescribed program
involving control of the most serious diseases and parasites. One hundred
head of sheep, cattle and poultry have been taken in each case to illustrate
income changes. The estimated annual income improvement per head at full
development, three years from first adoption, is estimated at AF 308 (US$7.7)
for sheep; AF 246 (US$6.16) for goats; AF 1,003 (US$25) for cattle; and
poultry AF 45 (US$1.13) per head after 2 years. To allow for uncertainties
surrounding projections of this nature, technical contingencies of 40% for
sheep and goats and 50% for cattle and poultry, have reduced these per capita
benefits to AF 180 for sheep, AF 144 for goats, AF 500 for cattle, and AF 22
for poultry for sedentary livestock owning families. Benefits for nomad live-
stock have been assumed at 50% of these. Each sedentary family is assumed
to own 6 sheep, 2 goats, 2 cows, and 5 poultry and would, on adopting the full
veterinary program increase annual income in year 4 by AF 2,478 (US$62) or
about US$7 per capita. In year 7, about 30,000 farm families and some 3,000-
4,000 nomad groups would be fully participating. Details of these estimates
may be seen in Project File Working Paper C-3.
B. Production
6.08      At full development, in year 9 resulting annual production levels
from project participating farms are estimated as follows:

Incremental output for all crops has been arrived at after allowing for
'without project' increases of 1-1/2% per annum during the first 4 project
years. This increase is roughly in line with trends in national production
during the past decade. For livestock no similar trend can be shown and no
'without project' production increases have been assumed. Except for 1,000 ha
which presently are fallowed each year, but which as a consequence of improved
management of Bande Seraj Dam would be irrigated with the project, total area
under crops remains unaltered. Project area wheat yields currently range from
1.3 to 1.8 tons per hectare. With the project, it is assumed that project
beneficiaries (13,000 families full impact) would adopt the proposed cropping
pattern and technical input package in full including credit financed invest-
ments and consequently increase wheat yields, over 4 years, to 2.1 tons per
hectare.   The extension service component would assist a further 35,000
farmers who would increase wheat yields from 1.3 to 1.6 tons per hectare over
four years. Project area potato production presently accounts for about 77%
of national production. With the project full technical and credit package
(13,000 families) potato yields would increase from 11 tons to 17 tons per



- 46 -
hectare at full development in year 4.  Corresponding yield increase attri-
buted to extension service (35,000 families) would be from 11 tons to 12 tons
per hectare over 6 years. The cropping pattern also includes rice, beans,
onions and fruits (apple). Incremental output of fruits, beans and onions
would be marginal.
6.09      In the  livestock sub-sector, the project would initiate a major
animal health control program at both the village level and among nomadic
flocks and herds. Improved animal health combined with animal nutrition and
husbandry extension would, at full production in about year 11 increase annual
offtake for sheep and goats from about 21% to 41%, and for cattle from about
9% to 20%. Annual incremental meat production would amount to about 770 tons,
milk about 6,200 tons and wool about 126 tons. These estimates are based on
annual treatment of 540,000 sheep and goats, 80,000 cattle, and 190,000
poultry among about 34,000 families.
C. Marketing
6.10      Cereals.  Projected wheat production at full development would
represent less than 1% of national wheat output. 1/ Owing to recurrent
deficits in staple grain (wheat, but also rice, barley, and maize) supplies
in Afghanistan, the incremental wheat production would serve largely as import
substitute. Due to the predominance of subsistence farm families, the addi-
tional output would be mostly consumed on the farms and any marketable surplus
would be easily absorbed by the principal population centers, of Ghazni and
Maidan towns, and nearby Kabul. Although the present food balance is not
known exactly, wheat 2/ is transferred from other regions particularly to
Ghazni where yields are lower. Although t:he proposed project would not make
the two provinces self-sufficient, it would nevertheless ease the food problem
and improve the diet of the rural poor.
6.11      Marketed wheat production is estimated at 30-40% of national pro-
duction. The primary outlet channels for food crops are the local markets
although project area farmers rely heavily on traders for marketing since the
Government owned Food Procurement Department (FPD) provides only limited
services. Although available transportation is adequate for marketing all
surplus produce, lack of current market information often benefits traders at
producers expense. Moreover, poor on-farn storage facilities force producers
to sell during periods of heavy supply and often at lower than Government
1/   Assuming wheat production continues to grow at the current optimistic
annual growth rate of 2.9% from 1982/83 (end of the Seven-Year Plan),
total output would reach 4.0 million tons by 1987/88.

However, wheat output of the project area is only 6% of total national
production.

minimum prices. To remedy this, the proposed project would stimulate forma-
tion of producers' cooperatives which would establish marketing channels
directly with wholesalers, or FPD which currently has plans to expand activi-
ties in the project area.  Furthermore, cooperatives would have access to
AgBank credit for financing small storage facilities and working capital, thus
enabling them to assist members by purchasing during peak supply periods and
selling under more favorable market conditions.
6.12      Fruits and Vegetables.  With the Project, the project area would
maintain its share of national potato production (77%). In addition to the
domestic market, Afghanistan's proximity to Iran and the Soviet Union offers
potentially wide markets for potatoes and other temperate vegetables. Iran's
1975/76 potato consumption estimated at 400,000 tons (10% imported), is
projected to grow at an annual rate of 9% up to 1985.   Similarly, the Soviet
Union's potato and vegetable projected imports for the same period, is about
150,000 tons annually. Provided strict quality control measures are intro-
duced, Afghanistan should if necessary, have little difficulty in expanding
its fruit and vegetable exports in these markets, due to competitive trans-
port costs and existing cultural and trade relationships.  The primary objec-
tives of the on-going IDA-assisted Fruit and Vegetables Export Project
(Credit 779-AF) include strengthening and establishing appropriate institu-
tions to monitor the standard and quality of exportable fruits and vegetables
(potatoes and onions initially) and stimulating exports of these commodities.
Afghanistan has succeeded in capturing a considerable share of grape and
raisin markets in Pakistan, India and the Soviet Union. In recent years
exports of these fruits have accounted for 25% of Afghanistan's foreign
exchange earnings. The ongoing fruit and vegetable project will make a
special effort to increase vegetable exports, particularly to Iran.
6.13      Under the proposed project, incremental annual apple production
would reach 3,200 tons. At present fruits from the Project are transported
to Kabul or consumed on the farms. Since the incremental apple production
represents less than 1% of total Afghan output, marketing problems are not
anticipated.
6.14      Livestock.  Per capita meat consumption in the project area remains
very low (10-11 kg) and the annual incremental production of 770 tons by year
10 would be easily absorbed by meeting part of increasing local demand.
Furthermore, HLDC is expected to sign a long-term export mutton contract soon.
The potential export demand for mutton in the Middle East, including the Gulf
States, and the Soviet Union, is such that with domestic consumption growth,
the incremental project output would have outlets at current prices in almost
unlimited markets. Finally, the incremental milk output at full development
estimated at 6.2 million liters (equivalent to 1% of total projected Afghan
production) would be consumed on the farms as fresh milk or as traditional
milk products such as ghee, cheese, butter and curds.



- 48 -
D.  Prices
6.15       Two sets of prices, financial and economic have been used in
valuing costs and benefits for project beneficiaries and the economy (Table 5
Annex 1). Despite Government's intervention in the marketing system, producer
prices particularly for wheat continually fluctuate in response to supply and
demand. Annually, the Government decrees floor prices for selected agricul-
tural products (wheat, cotton, sugar beet). Cotton and beet prices are effec-
tively controlled but, due to organizational and financial weaknesses, FPD
has not been effective in stabilizing wheat prices for both consumers and
producers; this is likely to happen in the near future when the Wheat Produc-
tion Project currently under IDA's active consideration is approved for
implementation. Farmgate prices used in farm budget analysis are lower than
the official Government wheat prices by a margin of 10-15%. It is assumed
that the project area incremental output would largely be consumed on-farm
and would not induce farmgate price reductions.  For the economic analysis,
all tradeable commodities are valued at international prices adjusted for
transport costs and using shadow foreign exchange rates (Af 46 to US$).
International price projections issued by the Bank's Commodities Division
(June 1978) have been used for wheat, rice, beef and fertilizers. For mutton
the price recently negotiated for export from Afghanistan has been used. For
wheat, the economic farmgate prices are higher than the financial farmgate
prices by about 20%. The current Afghan average financial price has been
used in both financial and economic calculations for both cow and sheep milk.
Border equivalent prices of fertilizers however are 15% lower than the corres-
ponding actual domestic prices.
E. Economic Analysis
6.16      The proposed project is consistent with DRA rural sector objectives
to increase food production and improve the quality of life of the rural poor.
Project generated production would save foreign exchange through import
substitution (wheat) and increase export earnings (fruits, vegetables and
mutton), but it would have much wider economic, financial and social benefits.
Although quantifiable benefits vary, the Project as proposed, represents an
integrated package in which each componen,t is an equally important part.
6.17      Economic Rate of Return.  Economic rates of return have been computed
for those components for which benefits can be reasonably quantified including
crop production, veterinary services, and the total project. Benefits have
not been quantified for village water supplies. The following assumptions
have been made in the economic analysis:
(a)  The shadow exchange rate is assumed to be AF 46 instead of
AF 34 which is the current exchange rate. 1/ Hence all tradeable
items have been converted at t'he shadow exchange rate.
1/   At July 1978; the exchange rate in May 1978 was reportedly Af 45 = US$1.0.



- 49 -
(b)  Due to mobility of labor in Afghanistan and occasional
shortages, the going market wage rate of AF 80 per day
for unskilled and family labor has been adopted.
(c)  Taxes and import subsidies have been excluded.
(d)  The project life is assumed to be 20 years.
(e)  Provision has been made for vehicles replacement cost,
and where applicable other equipment; no residual
values have been incorporated into the analysis.
The resulting rates of return and sensitivity analyses, which are based on the
estimated benefits to be derived from the proposed investments and capitalized
operations costs (5 years) are given below:

/2   Veterinary Services, and Range Management.
/3   Includes all project components and cost (Table 1, page 32) except the
cost of Irrigation Dam and Project Preparation Feasibility Studies
(US$1.1 million).
Calculation of benefits from the Minor Road Improvement Component was based
on road users savings in operating costs. An average daily traffic (ADT) of
about 30 vehicles (15 trucks, 10 buses and 5 cars) is assumed; no increase
over the life of the project has been included. The road component estimated
benefits are considered conservative and do not include long run, unquantifi-
able but important real benefits, including increased marketing activity,
easier access to administrative centers, improved opportunities for increasing
badly needed Government services both production orientated and social, prob-
able higher tax collection, and improved wider educational activities for
rural people. The condition of most rural roads in Afghanistan and in the
project area, is such that no rural development project as proposed, could be
successfully implemented without the inclusion of a road upgrading component.



- 50 -
The long run economic, financial and social benefits far exceed those which
can be reasonably estimated. Economic rates of return for the remaining
project components have not been separately computed because of interdependency
(irrigation, extension, research, cooperatives, credit) or difficulties in
quantifying benefits (cadastral survey, range management, and village water
supply). The overall project generates an economic rate of return of 22%
which is satisfactory. Project benefit and cost streams are presented in
Annex 1, Table 9.
6.18      Employment.  A primary source of employment in the project area
is agriculture, whilst an unknown proportion of the labor force is presently
employed in neighboring oil rich countries. With a gradual slowdown in labor
absorptive economic activities in neighboring countries many migrant workers
are likely to return to the agricultural sector. With the project, on-farm
labor requirements would increase by about 500,000 man days annually which
would be mostly balanced by utilization of presently underemployed labor.
Moreover, during project implementation a total of 700 permanent jobs and 200
man years of employment would be generated.  Additional unquantifiable employ-
ment opportunities would be created through the expected increases in market-
ing, commercial and transport activities.
F. Cost Recovery and Fiscal Impact
6.19      Cost recovery of public agricultural investments is an unresolved
issue in Afghanistan. Beneficiaries tend to view Government sponsored proj-
ects as 'public goods' and in the past have not been receptive to project
related payments, particularly for irrigation water. Water is regarded by
traditional right as a free resource despite it being the nation's most
valuable and scarce resource. Under IDA-financed Khanabad II Irrigation
Project (Credit 778-AF), DRA has agreed to review the overall socio-economic
implications and applicability of levying water charges on direct beneficia-
ries of Government financed investments and to implement an agreed system.
In the proposed rural development project, cost recovery could be grouped
into 4 categories. First, all agricultural credit financed investments would
pursue normal credit practices thus recovering full costs. Second, veterinary
service beneficiaries would pay the actual cost of veterinary medicines (AF
4-52 per head). On this basis and assuming the number of animals treated as
described in para. 6.09 about AF 12.2 million (US$306,000 1/) could be recovered
from year seven onwards. Total recovery from year 1 through 5 could amount
to AF 18 million (US$450,000 1/) or about 51 percent of total component cost.
Collection would be the responsibility of the village veterinary workers (VVW)
and at full development could amount to some 66% of vaccine and drug costs.
An effective veterinary service could make a significant contribution to
improving livestock production and improving the standard of living of rural
families, but the cost of providing such a service is presently beyond Govern-
ments financial capability. Livestock owners have demonstrated their willing-
ness to pay for drugs and medicines under the IDA-assisted second livestock
1/   Based on 1978 constant prices.



- 51 -
project (Credit 649-AF), under which Credit agreement charges for veterinary
services sufficient to cover full costs, are to be introduced in 1982.  With
a view to introducing some charges in the project area not later than March
31, 1981, DRA would study the issue of recovering the cost of vaccines and
clinical services by March 31, 1980. Third, for minor irrigation rehabilita-
tion, social custom presently prevents direct cost recovery through water
charges and as experienced under the First Agricultural Credit Project (Credit
202 AF), credit financing of works, due to both social and land ownership
problems, is not practical at present.  Decree No. 8 makes provision for
credit financing of minor irrigation works but DRA agrees that implementation
procedures require more careful study. Under terms of reference satisfactory
to DRA and IDA, RDD-RPIU in conjunction with Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry
of Water and Power and AgBank would, by March 31, 1981 assess the feasibility
of recovering investment costs of minor irrigation works to be implemented
under the Project. The ensuing report would be made available to IDA/IFAD
for review and comment and, if cost recovery is found feasible, would include
specific recommendations for the introduction of cost recovery on minor irri-
gation rehabilitation works commencing not later than March 31, 1982. Assur-
ances to this effect were obtained during negotiations. In the farm budget
analyses (Annex 3, C-6), farmers' ability to pay existing land tax at the rate
of AF200 per hectare (which provides some small indirect cost recovery) and
social tax at AF 400 has been demonstrated. However, beneficiaries with less
than 1 hectare should not be required to pay project fees due to their income
being below the absolute poverty income level. For both irrigation works and
village water supplies, the beneficiaries would be expected to meet, except
for technical advice, full operation and maintenance costs; which have not
been included in the project cost. Where road improvement applied directly
to specific villages, beneficiaries would be required to contribute unskilled
labor to original investment costs. Fourth, for the remaining project com-
ponents, no specific formula would be designed to collect project charges.
Cadastral survey, range management, research and extension costs would be
borne totally by Government. However, DRA is vigorously pursuing the collec-
tion of land taxes, which, as a result of project activities in cadastral
survey and roads, should increase in the project area in future.
6.20      The proposed project is not expected to create a major fiscal bur-
den on the DRA. Incremental operating and maintenance costs would average
AF 76.8 1/ million (US$1.5 million) annually during the five year project
implementation period, increasing from Af 24 million in year 1 to Af 108
million in year 5 (Annex 1, Table 1) in current Afghanis. This amount would
constitute 0.3% of the 1977/78 total expenditure for Afghanistan or 0.6% of
the estimated 1977/78 domestic revenue. After project completion, DRA would
finance the recurrent and replacement costs which relate to continuing project
activities for the remaining period of the project life averaging about AF 107
mil (US$ 2.7 mil) annually, before veterinary service cost recovery of about
Af 12 million.
1/   Of which IDA/IFAD would finance an average of Af 37.8 million (49%)
annually.

G. Risk
6.21      Afghan farmers have repeatedly dlemonstrated their willingness to
adopt new and improved technology provided it is thoroughly proven and
minimizes risks.  By concentrating initiaLly on improving crop husbandry
and water utilization and management techniques which do not involve undue
expense or radical crop pattern change it is expected that with the exten-
sion, veterinary and cooperative services, farmers are likely to adopt the
proposed technology and achieve the estimated increases in productivity and
income. The greatest risk lies in Govermnent's implementation of the pro-
posals for project organization and management and for coordination amongst
all concerned departments. The project would require close cooperation
between participating Government departments, ministries and agencies, the
lack of which has been prominent in the past in the Afghan development scene.
In addition to the major expansion of the provincial RDD, organization and
management proposals would build, expand and strengthen existing departments
and their agencies. At the provincial level good cooperation is likely to
develop under the new Government but this represents a major risk area. A
heavy responsibility would be placed upon senior Afghan staff to accept the
challenge of making the maximum use of the comparatively short periods during
which international consultants would be available to assist them in their
implementation efforts. In the past, too much expatriate input has resulted
in insufficient acceptance of responsibility by Afghan counterparts.
6.22      A further risk is involved in the minor irrigation rehabilitation
component where the sociological dimensions involved are not entirely under-
stood. Getting farmers to agree to undertake to assist and accept the pro-
posed works program and to maintain it adequately is always a risk. A problem
could arise with those farmers near the canal head whose water supply is
usually more adequate and who are usually the wealthiest and most influential.
Having derived the maximum benefit from the proposed works first, they may not
be particularly interested in assisting their poorer counterparts on the lower
reaches. Decree 8 however provides a legislative basis for minimizing this
risk.
6.23      Additional risks surround Government policy on land reform and
cooperatives which appear as the cornerstone of its agricultural policy. DRA
is acting decisively in implementing the land reform and cooperative programs
but the physical, social and administrative complexity in the hands of com-
paratively weak Departments and Agencies may prove an overriding constraint
to Government's intentions. Without good coordination of support services,
production and rural income may suffer a severe, although hopefully temporary,
setback.
6.24      The new Afghan Government has so far displayed decisiveness and
sincerity in endeavoring to bring about rapid fundamental changes in the
structure of society in general and the alleviation of rural poverty in
particular. Given this and the potential importance of the proposed project,
the judgment is that the risks described, although serious, are worth taking.



53 -
H. Environmental Impact
6.25       The proposed project would not have any detrimental impact on
the natural environment of the Project area.  On the other hand, project
activities in the fields of irrigation, agricultural production, forestry,
veterinary and range management should contribute to general ecological
stability in the area, protect water sheds and check soil erosion. The water
supply component would improve not only the accessibility but also the quality
of domestic water for participating villages and lead to an improvement in
human health in the appropriate influence zones. The veterinary component
would improve the health of livestock and poultry in the project area, but
in order to ensure the livestock numbers do not increase without a parallel
increase in the feed base which could result in further range degradation, it
will be essential for offtake to be increased.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations assurances were obtained that DRA would:
(i) Make part of the Credit and Fund Loan proceeds available
to AgBank under a subsidiary loan agreement to be entered
into between DRA and AgBank under terms and conditions
satisfactory to DRA and IDA including, inter alia, that
DRA would relend to AgBank amounts in various currencies
equivalent to $4.5 million for a term of fifteen years,
including five years of grace calculated from the date
of signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement, and at an
interest rate of 4-1/2% per annum on amounts withdrawn
and outstanding from time to time.
(ii) Transfer to AgBank, title in, and ownership of, the buil-
dings to be constructed for AgBank by RDD-RPIU under the
Project and the value of such buildings would constitute
an equity contribution by DRA to AgBank.

on minor irrigation works from the beneficiaries; (b) if such
cost recovery shall be found feasible, to recommend an imple-
mentation scheme for the cost recovery; and (c) to commence,

accounts and financial statements (balance sheets, statements
of income and expenses and related statements) and all records
supporting certificates of expenditure for each fiscal year
audited, in accordance with appropriate auditing principles,
by independent auditors acceptable to IDA: (c) furnish to
IDA not later than five months after the end of each such
year, certified copies of its financial statements for such
year as so audited and the auditors' report, including a
separate opinion showing whether the proceeds of the Credit
and the Fund Loan withdrawn on the basis of certificates of
expenditure have been used for the purpose for which they were
provided.
7.02      Procurement
(i) Except for contracts for vehicles, equipment and materials
estimated to cost less than $100,000, goods would be pro-
cured under contracts awarded in accordance with procedures
consistent with the "Guidelines for Procurement under World
Bank Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in March
1977 on the basis of international competitive bidding.
(ii) Contracts for vehicles, equipment and materials estimated to
cost less than $100,000 equivalent per contract would be
procured after inviting quotations from at least three sup-
pliers; such procurement would not in the aggregate exceed
$2,000,000 equivalent; and civil works would be procured
in accordance with DRA's competitive bidding procedures or
carried out by RDD-RPIU on force account.
7.03      Project operating procedures and policies would include:
(i) Minor Irrigation Rehabilitation
Four units including two construction units, a pile driving
unit and a small concrete-making facility would be estab-
lished within RDD-RPIU to carry out the construction. During



- 56 -
implementation, three fully qualified engineers would be
appointed. Special attention would be given to improving
the management of Bande Seraj Dam which would be operated
in accordance with policies and procedures satisfactory to
PRDC, WAPM, RDD-RPIU and IDA. RDD-RPIU would prepare and
furnish to DRA and IDA, not later than January 31, 1980,
the proposed policies and procedures for review and comment.
RDD-RPIU would prepare and furnish to IDA for its review
and comment the first three appraisals, to be made in
accordance with criteria satisfactory to the DRA, IDA and
IFAD, for medium and small permarnent diversion weirs and
intakes prior to the commencement of work in each case.
(ii) Agricultural Extension
The agricultural extension service in the Project Area would
be strengthened in accordance with a program satisfactory to
DRA and IDA. All housing would be designed and constructed
by RDD-RPIU. During project implementation about 8 fully
qualified subject matter specialists, 7 supervisors, and
65 village extension workers would be added to the existing
extension staff.
(iii) Applied Agricultural Research
An agricultural research station would be established with
about 20 hectares of suitable land in Ghazni to develop farm
technology suited to the area and the farmers therein.
(iv) Cooperatives
Special efforts would be made to establish through DCD, at
least 150 multi-purpose service cooperatives in the Project
Area, including pilot cooperatives for nomads. During project
implementation, three fully qualified Directors (Rank 4) and
19 District Directors (Rank 5) would be added to the existing
DCD staff.
(v) Range Management
The Forestry and Range Management Department would establish
an experimental range improvement center (ERIC) not later
than March 31, 1980, to undertake a work program, satisfactory
to DRA, IDA and IFAD.
(vi) Credit
AgBank would: (a) make short-t:erm loans for fertilizers and
improved seeds, and medium- ancd long-term loans for on-farm
development, farm machinery, water pumps, livestock, co-
operative storage facilities and offices, and for non-farm



- 57 -
rural enterprises; such loans being made through cooperatives
or directly to individuals; (b) make loans to cooperatives for
financing the purchase of members' produce and for construc-
tion of offices and storage facilities in accordance with a
policy satisfactory to the DRA, IDA, and IFAD and AgBank; and
not later than October 31, 1979 furnish proposals for ade-
quately securing loans to cooperatives to IDA for its review
and comment; (c) make short-term loans in accordance with a
passbook system enabling such initial loans to be made to
individuals without joint and several liability and sub-
sequent loans to be made on the basis of loan repayment record;
(d) establish a branch office in Maidan and progressively,
about five sub-branches in main centers in the Project area;
(e) authorize the Director of its Ghazni branch to approve
loans to individuals of up to Af 50,000 and to cooperatives
of up to Af 200,000 without prior approval of the head office;
(f) progressively increase loan approval authority of the
Directors of Ghazni and Maidan branches; (g) expand and
upgrade its repair workshop and spare parts depot in Ghazni;
increase its stock of water pumps and their spare parts
presently used by farmers, and improve its after-sales
service for farm machinery by maintaining qualified staff
in adequate numbers at the workshop and by stationing 3
mobile workshops in Ghazni; (h) give training courses to
village repair workshop owners and supply spare parts to
them on a wholesale basis; (i) make medium- and long-term
loans to village repair workshop owners for tools and spare
parts inventory on terms and conditions satisfactory to DRA
and IDA, and furnish its proposals for such loans to IDA
for its review and comment, not later than October 31, 1979.
(vii)  Veterinary Services
A village veterinary service would be established and the
existing mobile vaccination teams strengthened; HLDC would,
in consultation with MA and RDD-RPIU, establish a number of
buying points in the Project Area. Five fully equipped
veterinary sub-clinics would be established in larger dis-
trict farm service centers; selected villagers would be
trained as village veterinary workers and would work under
the supervision of 4 qualified veterinarians and 16 qualified
animal health assistants; and DRA would ensure that adequate
supplies of vaccines, veterinary medicines and drugs are
available at all times.
(viii)  Cadastral Survey
DRA would cause ACCSI to complete, in consultation with RDD-
RPIU, by June 30, 1983 the cadastral survey in the main irri-
gated areas in the Project Area.



- 58 -
(ix)  Roads
(a) Two fully equipped and staffed (including 2 fully quali-
fied road engineers) road construction teams would be estab-
lished within RDD-RPIU to upgrade about 400 km of minor roads;
(b) the design standards to be followed would be satisfactory
to DRA and IDA; (c) appraisals, detailed survey and design of
roads, prior to upgrading, would be carried out in accordance
with criteria satisfactory to DRAi and IDA. The first three
appraisals of roads to be upgraded would be prepared and fur-
nished by RDD-RPIU to IDA for its review and comment prior to
the commencement of upgrading in each case; and (d) DRA would
cause RDD-RPIU or MPW to maintain roads to be upgraded under
the Project in accordance with appropriate road maintenance
practices.
(x)  Village Water Supply
Potable water supply systems would be established in about
100 villages in accordance with a plan prepared jointly by
the RDD-RPIU and the appropriate department of the MPW; and
(a) each water supply system shall be individually surveyed
and designed by RDD-RPIU; (b) the selection of the water
supply system and of the site of installation would be made
in accordance with criteria satisfactory to IDA and IFAD; and
(c) the first three appraisals of water supply systems would
be prepared and furnished by RDD-RPIU to IDA for its review
and comment prior to the commencement of work in each case.
(xi)  RDD-RPIU
There would be established, and thereafter maintained, a
Regional Planning and Implementation Unit within RDD at Ghazni,
with funds, facilities, organizations, powers and policies and
procedures satisfactory to DRA and IDA; and (a) the President
of RDD-RPIU would, inter alia, be given full authority, for
purposes of the Project to: (i) authorize purchases of up
to Af 500,000 without any further approval or authorization;
(ii) make purchases of up to Af 20,000 without the use of a
purchasing committee; and (iii) enter into contracts with
firms or contractors for carrying out civil works; (b) all

also fix the wages; (c) with the exception o` vehicles of
AgBank and AFC, fuel for all vehicles to be provided under
the Project would be provided by RDD-RPIU in accordance with
procedures to be established by RDD-RPIU; (d) RDD-RPIU would
set up within its organization and fill the positions of the
President, two Vice Presidents, three Director-Generals and
about nine Directors with duly qualified and experienced

- 59 -
would be prepared on a program and line item basis ("program
basis" means the system of budgeting based on the costs of
the project or projects on which monies are to be expanded).
(xii)  A team of consultants would be employed and maintained
pursuant to the UNDP Project Document which would provide
for IBRD to be the executing agency.
(xiii)  Provision of Motorcycles and Bicycles
With reference to the obligation of DRA to provide motor-
cycles and bicycles for project staff, DRA would examine the
feasibility of enabling the staff to purchase motorcycles and
bicycles through credit under the Project. Such examination
would be completed by March 21, 1980. Upon its completion,
DRA would submit its recommendations to IDA for its review
and comment. Such recommendations would include, inter alia,
details of (a) the mechanism by which each purchaser would
pay for the motorcycle or bicycle to be purchased (through
credit to be obtained from AgBank or salary deduction); and
(b) details of the method and amounts by which staff would be
reimbursed for operation, maintenance and depreciation costs.
70.4      AgBank would (a) maintain records and procedures adequate to record
and monitor the progress of the Project Credit component and not later than
six months after the Project Closing Date prepare and furnish to DRA, IDA and
IFAD a report, on the execution and initial operation of the Credit Component,
including its cost and the benefits derived from it, and the accomplishment
of the purposes of the Credit and the Fund Loan; (b) (i) have its accounts and
financial statements (balance sheets, statements of income and expenses and
related statements) and its records supporting certificates of expenditure for
each fiscal year audited, in accordance with appropriate auditing principles
by independent auditors acceptable to IDA; (ii) furnish to IDA and the Fund as
soon as available, but in any case not later than four months after the end of
each such year, (A) certified copies of its financial statements for such year
as so audited and (B) the report of such audit by said auditors, of scope and
in such detail as IDA shall have reasonably requested including a separate
opinion by said auditors in respect of such certificates of expenditure show-
ing whether the proceeds of the Credit and Fund Loan withdrawn by AgBank on
the basis of certificates of expenditure have been used for the purpose for
which they were provided.
7.05      Effectiveness.  The following events are specified as conditions to
the effectiveness of the Development Credit; (a) the execution and delivery on
behalf of DRA of the Fund Loan Agreement have been duly authorized or ratified
by all necessary governmental action; and the Fund has appointed IDA as coop-
erating institution to administer the Fund Loan and the Fund Grant on terms
and conditions satisfactory to IDA; (b) the Subsidiary Loan Agreement has been
executed on behalf of DRA and AgBank; (c) a Regional Planning and Implementa-
tion Unit has been duly established within RDD (with adequate land for its



- 60 -
offices and depot free of any cost to such Unit), (d) the President, two Vice
Presidents and three Director Generals for RDD-RPIU have been appointed; (e)
the PRDC at Ghazni with membership, powers, responsibilities and functions
satisfactory to DRA and IDA has been duly established; (f) the UNDP Technical
Assistance Project Document has been signed by all parties thereto; (g) PCCRD
has been duly established; (h) and the appropriate legislative instrument or
instruments establishing RDD-RPIU, PCCRD, PRDC at Ghazni, and making provision
for the establishment of other required PRDCs has entered into full force and
effect.
7.06      With these assurances the Project would be suitable for an IDA
credit of US$16.5 million and an IFAD Loan of US$13.0 million.

APPRAISAL OF
GHAZNI-WARDAK AGRICULTURAL RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
AFGHANISTAN
Statements of Expenditure
1.0 Force Account
1.01      Under the proposed Project, force account procedures would be
employed by RDD-RPIU for minor road improvement, minor irrigation rehabilita-
tion, village water supplies and the building construction program. Where
force account procedures are adopted, RDD-RPIU through its Accounting Depart-
ment would establish systems satisfactory to IDA to monitor the cost in each
case and produce adequate data to support Statements of Expenditure for
IDA/IFAD withdrawal applications. An experienced international accountant-
administrator would be employed in the early stages of project implementation
(for a total period of at least 3 years) and his responsibility would include
the establishment of satisfactory accounting procedures. In all cases, dis-
bursements would be made in local currency. Supervision missions would be
required to spot check civil works undertaken under force account procedures,
and make inspections to satisfy itself that the work has been completed and
that the expenditure claim is reasonable.
2.0 Operating Costs
2.01      The project would disperse funds to finance 60% of incremental local
staff salaries, vehicle operating costs and RDD-RPIU operating costs and
respective withdrawal applications would involve Statement of Expenditure
procedures. The participating Government departments each have their own
accounting departments both at head office and the provincial level. The
accounting procedures are satisfactory to allow identification of both indi-
vidual and total salaries paid. Each Department would submit withdrawal
applications to RDD-RPIU on a monthly basis. The RDD-RPIU Accounting and
Administration Department would satisfy itself that the expenditure claimed
was in line with total budget estimates and for the purposes stated and would
reimburse the department concerned for that percentage of salaries to be
financed by IDA/IFAD. RDD-RPIU would make the withdrawal application through
AgBank supported with the necessary Statement of Expenditure. Spot checks
of the withdrawal applications would be made by supervision missions. All
Department accounts are audited by Government Auditors while under the Project
RDD-RPIU accounts would be audited by independent Auditors under terms of
reference satisfactory to the Association.
3.0 On Lending by Financial Intermediaries
3.01      Under the project credit component, the Agricultural Development
Bank would disperse for some 13,000 on-farm development loans which include
short-term loans for fertilizer, improved seed, and medium and long-term loans

for purchase of oxen, orchard establishment, small farm locally made imple-
ments, water pumps and other on-farm development. Presently, IDA accepts from
the Agricultural Development Bank under the Second and Third Agricultural
Credit projects (Credits 539-AF and 721-AF), and under the Livestock Develop-
ment projects (Credits 375-AF and 6479-AF), Statements of Expenditure to cover
that proportion of short-term lending (seeds and fertilizer) and on-farm
development which is to be IDA financed under the respective credits. AgBank
is experienced with this type of application and its accounting and adminis-
trative procedures are satisfactory. Supervision missions make spot checks of
the data retained by AgBank and this would continue for the proposed Ghazni-
Wardak Rural Development Project. As with all ongoing Credit Projects, AgBank
would have its accounts pertaining to the Project independently audited under
terms of reference satisfactory to the Association.
