SUNMARY AND CONCIUSIONS
i.        This report brings up to date the situation ad prospects of
CIH which were described in detail two years ago in report R70-153, dated
July 30, 1972.
ii.       Tourism is one of the key sectors in Morocco's economic develop-
ment and, as Morocco is now preparing a new Five-Year Plan (to be effective during
the period 1973-1977), considerable efforts need to be made in the definition
of objectives and in making policies and regulations relating to tourism
development. In this process, the system of financial incentives provided
to tourism investors also needs to be reviewed so that it is consistent with
national objectives. As the tourism sector is one to which the Bank expects
to lend considerable funds, the Bank has offered its advice to Morocco in
respect of the formulation of policies and the review of incentives. The
Government has welcomed this offer and the Bank intends to follow this up.
iii.      In 1970, and 1971 in spite of a slow-down following the abortive
coupd'4tat in July, tourism traffic continued to follow an upward trend.
However, the pressure from demand was not accompanied in these two years
by a parallel increase in tourism infrastructure and hotel construction.
The slow rate of growth of capacity for tourists and related facilities was
due in large part to the lack of a well established tourism policy and a
slow-down in investment in the second half of 1971. Thus, CIH's hotel
operations in 1971 have not grown as originally expected and hotel commit-
ments in 1971 were only about DH 30 million as compared to nearly DH 100
million in 1969. On the other hand, CIH housing operations, in response to
a high demand and following the adoption by CIH in 1969 of more liberal
policies, continued to expand at a fast rate;  comnitments in 1971, which
reached nearly DH 50 million, exceeded,for the first time since 1966, hotel
loan commitments.
iv.       Over the last two years, CIH organization and management suffered
some dislocations. A new Director General, appointed in July 1971, has,
however, started a substantial reorganization of CIH. Appraisal work has
improved recently, and arrangements for further improvements are being made
to give CIH's appraisal a firmer assessment of the marketing aspect of its
projects and better economic Justification. Follow-up, which was particularly
weak, is being strengthened though it will take some time before a well-
functioning system is fully operational.
v.        CIH's delinquent loans had increased considerably in 1971;  two
hotel companies, representing 24% of CIH's hotel portfolio, and in which the
Government has substantial equity holdings interest, were of special concern.
During negotiations, the Government agreed to take measures to protect CIH
against possible losses on these loans. Given these assurances, CIH's
portfolio is reasonably sound and CIH is creditworthy for a new Bank loan.



- ii -
vi.       Given a stable investment climate and sound tourism policies,
CIH has good business prospects both in its housing and hotel fZinancing
operations. Indications are that the decline in hotel investment in 1971
has been reversed and CIH is now facing a brisk demand for loans to finance
hotel construction. If CIH makes further progress in strengthening its
organization, it should be able to carry out its present forecast, implying
an increase in its total commitments fram DH 80 million in 1971 to DH 175
million in 1976. The present Bank loan is expected to be fully committed
shortly. Though CIH is able to raise a sizeable amount of capital in the
domestic market, it also needs to borrow abroad to maintain its hotel lend-
ing operations, 55% of which calls for import financing. CIH has asked
the Bank to help cover its commitments,that result in imported goods.  A
suitable amount for the second Bank loan to CIH would be $15 million. Such
a loan should enable CIH to carry its estimated import financing commitments
through the end of 1973.
vii.      The proposed loan to CIH should be made on the standard terms and
conditions of Bank loans to development finance companies, including standard
commitment fee. The free limit above which Bank approval of a project is required
should be raised from $100,000 to $200,000; the aggregate free limit should be
US$ 4 million.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report updates the situation and prospects of CIH which
were described in detail two years ago in Report R70-153, dated July 30,
1970. The first Bank loan to CIH of $10 million was made on August 12,
1M70 and becarne effective on January 28, 1971. Twenty-six projects have
so far been authorized for withdrawal under this loan for a total amount
of $9M million. The balance of the loan is expected to be fully commit-
ted shortly; this report appraises CIH for a new loan for its hotel
financing.
II. TOURISM DEVELOPMENT IN MOROCCO
2.01      A Bank economic mission visited Morocco in April 1971.  Its
report (alA-L2 dated September 9, 1971) dealt in detail with the develop-
ment of tourism.
Traffic
2.02      In 1971, tourism traffic in Morocco has continued to follow an
upward trend. However, following the abortive coup d'etat of July 10, 1971,
and several cholera cases in the summer of 1971, the growth was somewhat
below expectation (see Annexes 1 and 2). Tourist arrivals in 1971 were
915.00C including 623,000 stop-over visitors.  This represented only a 7.4%
increase in 1971 as compared to an increase of about 19% in 1970. Still,
the rate of growth of Morocco's tourism traffic over the past three years was one
of the highest among countries of the Mediterranean area.
2.v3      So far, Morocco's main clientele have been European visitors who
account for roughly 50% of the stop-over traffic. Since 165, the number
of European visitors more than doubled, with the French retaining the first
promotion and the establishment of direct airlines service with the United
States, North Americans (157,400 visitors in 1971) have increased their
share from 7.5A in 1965 to 19.2% in 1971.
2.04      Another structural change is occuring in demand: vacation tourism,
particularly in beach resorts, is increasing in importance as against business
travel. As a result, there has been an accentuation of the seasonal pattern
of overall demand for accommodation and a growing concentration of tourism
in coastal centers. Indeed, future development of tourism in Morocco will
probably occur primarily on the coasts. The seasonal pattern has mainly
affected the facilities in the Northern coast of Morocco while hotels in the
South, principally around Agadir, maintained a high level of occupancy all
year around.

Hotel Development
2.05      The past decade has seen a rapid development of hotel capacity in
Morocco. Since the beginning of the current Plan (1968-1972), Morocco's
hotel capacity increased by over 50% and amounted to 35,700 beds as of the
end of 1971;  5,500 beds were in five-starJi, 6,500 in four-star, 6,000 in
three-star category and 8,500 beds in vacation villages. During 1968-1971, against
?4,000 beds foreseen in the Plan, only 12,000 beds were constructed (two-thirc.
by private investors), at a total investment cost of DH 295 million, averaging
about DH 24,000 per bed. Of about 12,000 beds now under construction, 4-5,000
should be completed before the end of 1972 and the balance in 1973. This would
bring the total beds built since the beginning of the Plan (1968) to approxi-
mately 16-17,000 by December 1972, as against the target of 30,000 beds. The
rising occupancy rates in Morocco (55% bed occupancy on the average in 1970,
one of the highest among Mediterranean countries) indicate that capacity is
lagging behind demand. The shortfall in construction of accomodation for
tourists is due in part, to a lack of implementatinn of needed infrastructure
programs, particularly to complete the programs in Tangiers, Smir and Al Hoceima
zones and to develop the Agadir zone.
2.06      The current five-year Plan gives priority to the construction of
cheaper accomodation in view of the desirable and forecast increase in mass
(group, charter, etc.) tourism. Therefore, three-star and vacation village
units were expected to expand more rapidly than luxury or expensive four- and
five-star hotels. The Plan however, or subsequent regulations, provided little
incentive favoring particularly moderately priced accomodations. As a result,
there has not been, until recently, a significant up-swing in hotel develop-
ment, officially classified for service to mass tourism. (From the nearly
36,000 beds available at the end of 1971, 17% were still in hotels in the
five-star category as against the planned percentage of 11%). However, the
official classification may not do justice to the actual development because
quite a number of hotels classified as four-star hotels are really only three-
star hotels in terms of their actual tariffs and facilities.  Furthermore,
more recently, there has been some movement in building three-star hotels and
vacation villages - about one-third of total hotel capacity being built in the
last three years - and hotels in these categories now take up about 40% of
total hotel capacity. This development is largely due to the high returns
associated with the operation of vacation villages and 3-star hotels. It would
seem therefore that the interest of investors has to some extent fulfilled
the Plan's objectives, but it is likely that this development would have been
greater if it had been supported by more selective incentives.
2.07      Execution of the current tourism Elan lags considerably behind
targets and, although the advances achieved in the past few years are
encouraging, the tourism sector in Morocco still has some way to go to
1/ MToroccan hotels are given five principal classifications expressed
in stars and reflected in tariffs. A 5-star hotel is luxury class,
3-star facilities offer comfortable accommodation and 1-star hotels
are generally not attractive to international tourism. Unless specified
in this report, vacation villages are included under the general
designation of hotel enterprises.

achieve its full potential. Morocco is now in the process of formulating
the next five-year Plan and therefore needs to take stock carefully as to
the direction and pace of tourism development in the future, and how to
coordinate the development of infrastructure, with efforts to promote hotel
investments and traffic, and related incentive policies for hotel investment.
Such coordination should result in a basis for a more rational incentive
system and an integrated, consistent tourism plan.
Government Incentives to Tourism Investments
2.08      The spurt in Morocco's hotel development in the sixties has been
enhanced by a considerable assistance fram the Government. Such assistance
comprises a variety of incentives (Annex 4).  The leading ones are:
a.    an equipment grant of up to 15% (usually about 10%
of the fixed investment in a hotel project), in the
form of a one-time contribution to the needed financing;
b.    an interest subsidy of 4.25% per annum on CIH loans
which reduces the effective cost of such loans to
h.5% to hotel sponsors.
2.09      Investment Cost Subsidies.   Since investors are also often
reimbursed for custom duties and value added taxes, which typically amount
to approximately 6% of fixed investment, the Government contributes at the
outset about 16% of fixed investment costs. As CIH, as a matter of policy,
finances on the average about 50% of the value of the hotel property, the
sponsors need only contribute about one-third of the fixed costs. Thus, a
typical hotel project in Morocco is financed by the following sources of
funds:
Equity                        34.0%
Government contribution       16.0% p
CIH loan                      50.0%
100.0%
2.10      Interest {late Subsidies.   One attraction to investors in tourism
projects is CIH's low effective rate of interest, 4.5% p.a., resulting from
the interest rebate. The discounted present value of interest subsidies
alone (they come on top of the Government's typical contributions of 16'p p.a.
of investment costs) are equivalent to about 9% of these costs. Several
foreign investors have reported that the low effective rate of interest had
been a major attraction to invest in Morocco. Any proposal to change the
effective interest rate on CIH's hotel loans should therefore be made, and
implemented, with great care. A review of the incentive system will have to
focus particularly on the economic justification for continued rebates of
CIH's interest rate on hotel loans.
1/ This does not take into account interest subsidies and accelerated
depreciation detailed in Annex 4.



- 4 -
2.11      The importance to both CIH and the hotel investor of the interest
subsidy is shown below (DH million):
1968    1969    1970C   1971
Interest rebatel/                   4.4     7.2      7.2    12.1
Interest paid by CIH clients        2.5     3.4      8.3     9.5
Total interest received
by CIH (at 8.75% p.a.)           7.2    10.6    1'f      21.6
2.12      While in the past the Government was late in paying CIH the interest
subsidies due to it, thus creating cash flow problems for the company, this
problem has disappeared following negotiations for the first Bank loan. The
administration of the subsidy by CIH has proved to be efficienit and has not
compromised CIH's autonomy.
2.13      The substantial amount of Government subsidies increases the finan-
cial leverage available to the investor in financing a hotel project, and
investors have responded rapidly and willingly to these encouragements. The
Government's sizeable contribution indicates the importance tlhe authorities
give to the launching of new hotels. Also, since CIH estimates that about
40% of all hotels in Morocco are owned or sponsored by foreigners, a sub-
stantial part of the Government's contribution is an "aid" to foreign invest-
ments.  CIH estimates that, exclusive of IBRD loans, actual foreign exchange
transfers oo Morocco for hotel investments amounted to about 10% of total
investments since 1967 (i.e. about one-third of total equity investment in
hotels). This percentage includes investments from large foreign investor
groups (Club Mediterranee, Holiday Inn, Ramada International, etc).
2.14      Without the large and attractive form of incentives to assist
tourism investments, tourism growth to the extent experienced would probably
not have occurred. However, it is difficult to quantitatively assess to
what extent available incentives nave resulted in accelerated investment
and contributed to an economically advantageous allocation of resources -n
the tourism sector. The Moroccan authorities are aware that such an assess-
ment would have an important contribution to the work now underway in formu-
lating Morocco's 1973-77 tourism development program. As the tourism sector
is a key one in the Moroccan economy and one to which the Bank envisages
to lend considerable funds, the Bank has offered Morocco its advice in this
work.
2.15      A number of important questions deserve consideration in view of
the substantial deployment of resources to hotel incentives, namely:
1/ The growth of the rebate is not directly proportional to the
increase of the portfolio because the system of incentives, prior to
1969, was substantially different from the present one.



a. the economic returns to Morocco resulting from the
above investment;
b. whether the aggregate level of incentives should be increased,
decreased or left unchanged; whether the particular mix of
incentives should be modified; whether the system should be
made more selective in favor of specific regions and types of
accommodations; and whether only the hotels and vacation
villages should (as is now the case) receive incentives;
c. whether the administration of incentives can stay as it is
or needs to be changed in light of the suggested review.
Appropriate incentives are inevetably linked with the overall approach
that Morocco wishes to follow. CIH's lending terms are an integral
part of the incentive package. It is those terms, their relations to
other incentives, and the relation of investment incentives to an appropriate
tourism development strategy which must also concern the Bank directly.
The Moroccan Government has agreed to systematically review these matters
with the Bank and a Bank mission left at the end of May for Morocco to
initiate a program along these lines. During negotiations, the Bank indicated
to the Government that the outcome of the Bank review of Morocco's tourism
development policies, including a satisfactory incentive program, would
have a strong bearing on its future lending to the tourism sector in Morocco.

III.   CIH'S ROLE IN THE MOROCCAN ECONOMY
3.01      CIH has had a major role in the economy for some years, first in
financing housing in urban centers, but increasingly, since 1962, in the
construction of hotels and vacation villages in Morocco.  CIH continues to
provide mortgage financing for houses and apartmants.  It has been doing this
for over 50 years and this part of its operations is efficiently performed.
More recently, CIH has had an important role in the growth of tourism in
Morocco, now the country's leading source of foreign exchange earnings ($137
million in 1970 and an estimated $131 million for the first ten months of
1971). The increase in CIH financing of hotel and housing construction has
also resulted in the important development of suppliers' industries (essen-
tially cement, wood and other construction materials), the output of which
has increased at an average,estimated,by CIH of 1% per annum over the past
three years.
CIH as a 1Mobilizer of Resources
3.02      Over the past four years, 1968-1971, CIH raised resources (see
Annex 5) amounting to about DH 350 million, roughly half of which was in
long-term marketable debentures placed with CDG. These debentures are for
15 years and yield about 6%. Access to themarket is closely controlled by
the Government; indeed, to date, only the Government, CIH, the Electricity
Authority and, for the first time in 1971, BNDE, have been allowed to sell
such debentures.  For the bulk (over 80%) of its resoEce needs, CIH has
depended on official sources: its parent company, CDG- , the Banque du Marc,
the Banque du Credit Populaire and the World Bank (indirectly via BNDE/ during
1966-1970, and directly since CIH got its first Bank loan). Efforts have also
been made to tap the narrow capital market of Morocco. CIH has floated
medium-term bonds since 1968 and issued DH 15 million of 15 year-bonds in 1969
which were subscribed by the public. CIH is aware that the Bank will not in
the long run cover the entire foreign exchange requirements for its hotel
financing and it has just started to investigate with foreign lenders the
1/   Caisse de Depots et de Gestion is the depository and administrator
of several public funds, most notably savings and social security
funds. Through investment of these funds, CDG has a pervasive role
through Morocco's economy, especially in financing various infrast-
ructure activities and through participation in several affiliates
including CIH, the Societe Maroc Tourist and the Societe Nationale
d'Investissement.
2/   Banque Nationale pour le Development Economique is the provider of
long-term funds, essentially for industrial purposes. To date ,BNDE
had received five Bank Loans. Until CIH received its first loan, BNDE
had been financing hotels either for its own account or through loans
to CIH0 The ENDE loans CIH obtained were provided by IBRD in accord with
a convention of September 1966 between BNDE, CIH and the Bank. As of
IMarch 31, 1972, 20 projects had been financed under this convention for
a total of DH 36.5 million. The convention lapsed in 1970 and, since,
CIH relies almost entirely on direct Bank financing for the import
component of the hotel projects it finances.

prospects of obtaining foreign capital. CIH forecasts that such capital
could be obtained for commitments starting in 1974.
CIH as an Allocator of Funds
3.03      Since CIH has so far not experienced any problems in raising
resources, it has been able to lend to projects according to demand. The
following table summarizes the trend since 1968 in hotel and housing lend-
ing operations (DH million):

3.04      CIH Housing Loans.   In housing, following a liberal policy change
in 19691/, CIH faced a strong demand for financing new houses in major cities
and resort areas, where it is the principal source for housing finance.
3.05      Between 1968 and 1971, over 1,500 housing loans for new units of
accomodation were signed, most of them in the medium price range. Over one
half of these have been for amounts up to DH 100,000, and approximately 31%
of these loans exceeded DH 200,000, including about 15% for apartment build-
ings. Most of CIH's housing loans have been in the cities, primarily in
Casablanca, Rabat and Fes.  CIH did little to support housing in rural areas,
an activity involving other specia1ized financial organizations such as
Credit Populaire.
1/ This temporary decline is explained in paragraph 6.03.
2/ At CIH's Annual General Meeting in June 1969, policies on loans and
mortgage evaluation were revised, as regards both individual dwelling
and apartment buildings. The new policy permits greater flexibility
in that CIH now takes more reali6tic cognizance of (i) the market
values of the properties, (ii) the personal creditwTorthiness of the
borrowers, and (iii) in the case of apartments, expected return on
investment and debt-service coverage.



3.06      CIHI Hotel Loans.   Between 1969 and 1971, the total capital coot
of hotel projects supported by CIH amounted to about Di 200 million, approximate-
ly 67% of total hotel investments which were authorized in Morocco during that
period. As of December 31, 1971, CIH had signed 2hh hotel loans with about
124 hotel enterpri3es. Hlotels financed by CIH are located mainly in Agadir
(43 loans), Tangiers (38 loans), Marrakech (22 loans), and Casablanca (19
loans), in addition to those in other resort areas, such as Al Hoceima,
Restinga and Mohamedia. Since 1967, an important development in CIH's
hotel financing has been the impact of large loans in its portfolio.   Fifteen
loans to hotel companies, each over DH 5 million, out of a total of 241h loans
made by December 31, 1971, represented about 5O//J of CIH's outstanding hotel
loans at that time.
3.07      Of all the hotel loans signed by CIH since its inception, about
111 out of 224 were made to the luxury and semi-luxury class (77 loans to
36 four-star and 34 loons to 17 five-star hotel units). In monetary terms,
CIH's commitments to the building of upper class hotels totalled approximately
DH 201 million over the past four years, i.e. about 78%) of its commitments to
the hotel sector. Since 1969, however, in response to a change in the pattern
of demand, CIH's involvement in new four-and five-star hotel projects has
decreased. In 1971, only 8 such projects wiere committed, as compared to 15
in 1969. In view of the good prospects for mass tourism traffic in Morocco,
the recent emphasis in CIH financing three-star hotels and vacation villages
is good, although CIH cculd even do more in encouraging and. advising hotel
developers to move in this direction.
Economic Justification of CIH's Hotel Projects,
3.08      Return on Investment.   Under the first Bank loan, CIH agreed that
th  hotel projects financed with Bank funds would stand a minimum return
test. The aim was to achieve an efficient use of resources and to establish
a warning signal against marginal projects, because there were indications
that the projected capital costs of hotels were excessive relative to the
accented standiar(ds in Morocco and th-tot nrofits were being siphoned of ! in the
construction contracts. The risks of uneconomic investments are accentuated by the
availability of grants and low cost loans for hotel projects. A minimum internal
rate of return of 10% (eliminating the impact of subsidies) was chosen as an
acceptability criterion for all projects financed by CIH with Bank funds.
3.09       Two years have passed since CIH started using this criterion.  It
has become a primary tool in CIH's appraisal, and has served a good purpose.
Projects entailing high capital costs and which did not achieve the desirable
return have received special scrutiny by CIH with a view to achieving econo-
mies of scale. This has been possible through the effective contribution of
CIH's Technical Division. Under the proposed second Bank loan, CIH has
agreed to apply the criterion not only to projects financed with Bank funds,
but to all its hotel projects.



_9 _
3.10      Judging from a sample of 23 hotel projects approved by CIH since
HMay 1, 1970 (the date from which CIR has applied the criterion), these projects
are expected to yield an average (weighted by their costs) internal rate of
return of about 17% per annum. The three-star hotels (1i%) show higher returns
than the four-and five-star projects (14%). But the vacation village projects
show by far the highest return which, on the basis of this sample, averages
about 24L/.
3.11      The reliability of these figures depends, in part, on the validity
of CIH's forecasts. As noted in paragraph 4.15, the weakness of CIH in
follow-up, and the resulting weakness in market analysis in its appraisals,
seem to have led, in a few instances to somewhat unrealistic forecasts of
rates of return. However, CIH has recently established an Economic and
Statistical Division which is bringing about improvements in its market
surveys and occupancy forecasts.
3.12      Balance of Paymrents Implications.  CIH's hotel projects make a
good contribution to Morocco's balance of payments. The net amount of
foreign exchange that CIHts projects are able to earn annually exceed the
expenditures in local currency for these projects by about 30%. This
percentage would be even higher if one took into account the additional
foreign exchange spent by tourists outside hotels.
3.13      Impact on Employment.   Few data are available on the impact which
tourism in general, and the hotel industry in particular, have had on Morocco's
unemployment problem. It is estimated, however, that hotels alone provide
employment at the rate of one job for every two beds. This assumption would
imply that about 20,000 people are now employed by the hotel industry. The
number may double by the end of 1976. The investment cost per job created
amounts to about $10,000 - a figure well below the cost per job created in
industry in Morocco and comparing well with the cost per job in the hotel
industry in other Mediterranean countries. So far, CIH has financed two-thirds
of the hotel beds in Morocco and thus CIH makes a creditable employment
contribution. A significant secondary effect can also be seen in the increased
employment in the construction industry, transportation and the various
industries supplying hotel construction and hotel operations.

IV.   CIHNS ORGANIZATION AND PROCEDURES,
4.01      There has been no change in the legal and institutional background
surrounding CIH, nor in CIH's policies, since the Bank first appraised CIH
in 1969. CIH's purpose and powers are governed by Royal Decrees issued in
1962 and 1968, its statutes and general laws of the cuuntry. Under these,
CIH has wide powers to lend, invest and guarantee, as long as these trans-
actions are related to the construction for housing, to hotel investments and
to other specifically  authorized operations.  As of December 31, 1971, public
sector ownership represented about 54% of CI0H's share of capital, including
34% owned by CDG (Annex 6).
Board of Directors
4.02      The composition and functions of the Board and the Executive
Committee, the membership of which is detailed in Annex 7, have not changed
significantly since the first Bank loan, except that CIH's Director General
became a voting member of the Executive Committee in November 1970. Public
sector representatives predominate. CIH's Executive Committee does not
actively discuss the details of investment proposals, although it must
formally pass on all projects.
4.03      This lack of probing of hotel projects by the Executive Conmhittee
could possibly be explained by the moderate experience of a number of
Executive Committee members in tourism financing. However, Some of the
Directors belong to organizations which are important shareholders of CIH,
such as the CDG and SNI and which also finance hotels. They also sit on the
Government's Commission which checks on the technical features of a hotel
project with a view to determining the projects that are eligible for Govern-
ment incentives and for CIH financing.
1lanagement and Staff
4.04      After five years with CIH, Mr. Mohamed Lazyak, Director General,
resigned in April 1971 to become Minister of Tourism. . Eis successor,
Mr. Mohammed Benchekroun, a former Director of the Budget in the Finance
lMinistry, was designated in July 1971.  In the interim, CIH was run by its
Deputy Director General.
4.05      The present Director General has contributed considerably during
his first year to solving CIH's problems and he decided that a general
reorganization of CIH was required.
1/   He was a victim of the attempted coup d'etat on July 10, 1971.



- 11 -
4.06      To head the Credit Department, which encompasses both hotel and
housing operatinns, a competent administrator, who was previously CIH's
legal advisor, was appointed. A new qualified Finance Director was also
appointed. Eight recent university graduates were hired who, though
still inexperienced, should eventually strengthen CIH's work on hotel
credits.  As discussed in paragraph 4.12, the Director General is keenly
aware that follow-up must be substantially improved.
4.07      The major problem at this point is that, at the senior level,
there is still little actual experience in hotel financing and CIH is
searching for a senior officer who will contribute such experience, especially
as regards market assessments, the promotion of appropriate hotel investments,
and generally guidance of CIH's hotel appraisal and follow-up work. CIH has
asked the Bank to help in locating such an officer, and the Bank has agreed
to do so.
Organization and Procedures
4.08      CIH has a staff of 80, of which 41 are at the professional level.
The company has recently been reorganized as shown in Annex 8. The organ-
ization provides for appropriate delegation of authority and offers efficient
lines of communication within the company. Essentially, CIH is now divided
into two departments, one dealing with lending operations (itself split in
two sections, Housing Credit and Hotel Credit) and the other dealing with
the financing of CIH itself. The former should be able, with proper help
from an advisor, to further develop good appraisal and supervision work.
The Finance Department has experienced personnel and it performs its functions
adequately, including disbursements. It is, however, headed by a part-time
Director. The Department needs full time direction, and CIH has been urged
during negotiations to make systematic efforts to have a permanent Financial
Di rector.
4.09      Housing Credit.   Fifty years of experience and a good staff in
the housing sector have led to good quality of CIH's housing business.
Procedures for housing loans are standard and the Housing Credit Division
is operating smoothly.
4.10      Hotel Credit.   CIH's hotel work still requires strengthening.
As said earlier, the main need is for a senior level officer with considerable
hotel financing experience to improve CIH's ability to make sound judgments on
the market aspects of hotel projects.
4.11      The Technical Division is the most experienced unit in CIH's Hotel
Credit Section. It consists of three experienced engineers and two assistants,
and it has played a decisive role in helping investors plan their projects on
a sound basis. Its role has also been important in advising the Government's
Hotel Investment Commission, which approves project proposals at the stage
of conception. CIH's technical work on hotel projects is performed reasonably
well, but there is an immediate practical possibility for one improvement
which was discussed during negotiations.  Stemming from a requirement in
the first Bank loan,control bureaus have assisted large CIH hotel borrowers



- 12 -
by reviewing the cost and design and subsequently supervising the con-
struction of their projects. The review of the cost and designs occurred
when CIH's own appraisal work was well along. Experience has been quite
good and in some circumstances the bureaus contributed to an -improvement
in design or reduction in costs of projects. Both CIH and the Bank have
come to the conclusion that the role of control bureaus could be even more
useful if the bureaus' review started earlier, namely at the time of project
conception. In this manner,when a project is not yet officially approved
by the Government's Hotel Investment Commission, worthwhile technical modifi-
cations can still be introduced. CIH has advised the Bank that it is trying
to arrange with the Ministry of Tourism a way to involve control bureaus at
an earlier stage.
4.12      Follow-up.   CIH follow-up of hotel projects in operation has
been practically non-existent in the past. CIH's management is anxious
to establish this activity on a systematic basis. Three staff members of
CIH have been appointed to this task. More than 40 hotels in operation
(out of about 80) were visited and supervision reports made. CIH plans to
have visited at least once, most, if not all, its clients in operation in
1972. A related matter is that CIH is still not doing enough to keep after
borrowers in arrears. This factor has contributed to the considerable increase
in 1971 of overdues in CIH's portfolio (see paragraph 5.07). The Director
General is concerned about the situation, and has instituted tighter collection
procedures. A review during negotiations of the limited results of these
more intensive procedures indicates that these efforts can be effective and
would, over the long run, keep CIH's overdues within manageable limits.
4.13      Disbursement. CIH's disbursement procedures are adquate; verification of
exDenditures is carefully controlled.  However, disbursements under the
first Bank loan were only $1.2 million as of April 30, 1972, against
$9 million committed. This slow disbursement of Bank funds appears to
be related to difficulties CIH has had with obtaining particular parts
of supporting documentation for its Bank withdrawal applications. This
matter has now been resolved and CIH should be able to increase its rate
of disbursement of funds committed under the Bank loan.
4.14      Procurement. Procurement practices are generally satisfactory: but they
could be improved. Although competitive bidding is arranged in most cases
by investors for some elements of their projects, CIH relies essentially on
its general experience about prices _nd contracts and reacts when these
are substantially out of line with established norms. Also, CIH claims that
competitive bidding on construction contracts in Morocco may be difficult to
apply given the lack of nationwide competition between contractors. Still,
CIH feels that it could improve its evaluation of contract prices. In this
respect, CIH agreed during negotiations to strengthen its supervision of
procurement practices and to get the control bureaus' views on such matters
for large projects (over DH 6 million).
Overall Assessment of CIH's Organization
4.15      CIH's effectiveness has improved markedly since the Bank made
its first loan. Some of the momentum in developing its competence was
lost duringthe past year due to the departure of some key personnel. However,
the company's new Director General has taken vigorous action to regain the
momentum. It is yet too early to evaluate the success of his efforts. An
important number of staff members have been recently hired but on balance,the
changes instituted appear to be in the right direction.

V. CIH'S FINANCIAL POSITION
Balance Sheet and Portfolio
5.01      CIH's accounts up to 1970, have been audited by Price Waterhouse
without qualification.  The audit of CIH's 1971 accounts is currently
underway. CIH's balance sheets and income statements for the period 1968-71
reflect a continuing growth in CIH's volume of business, principally in
its hotel portfolio.
5.02      Balance sheets for the years 196d and 1971 are given in Annex 9.
During 1971, CIH's portfolio increased by 16% as compared with 45% in 1970.
This slowdown in growth, related solely to hotel loans, resulted mainly
from a decline of commitments in 1970 and 1971 and, in part, from several
hotel investors delaying withdrawals because of the political uncertainty
prevailing in the second half of 1971. In 1971, CIH's total disbursements
for hotel projects amounted to DH 40 million, compared to DH 61 million
in 1970. CIH's 1971 outstanding housing loans continued to develop even
faster (at an average 45% growth rate p.a.) than in the past.
5.03      In accordance with an agreement reached at the time of the
first Bank loan to CIH, the debt of the Government to CIH, which amounted
to DH 10.5 million at the end of 1970, had been further reduced to DH
4.25 million by the end of 1971. As can be foreseen now, it will be fully
repaid before December 31, 1972.
5.04      CIH's liquidity position is sound.  As of December 31, 1971,
CIH's current ratio amounted to 1.8.
5.05      As of December 31, 1971, CIH's ratio of totallong-term borrowing
to net worth was 5:1  as against the 6:1 limit specified in the first
Bank Loan Agreement. The total debt/equity ratio at that date was 9.7:1.
Evaluation of CIH's Portfolio
5.06      The following table summarizes the arrears status of CIH's portfolio:

(housing loans)          (6.6)         (2.1))       (11.9)        (3.3)
5.07      CIH's loans in arrears increased considerably during 1971.  As of
December 21, 1971, amounts overdue over five months, both in principal and
interest, represented about 3.6% of CIH's total portfolio as compared to
only 2.0% in 1970. If, in addition, one takes into account the overdues for
less than five months, CIH's total overdues aggregate about 5.3i of the total
portfolio at the end of 1971. The deterioration is almost exlcusively
attributable to hotel loans and more particularly to a DH 30 million loan to
an important hotel company (see paragraph 5.11), whose arrears (all interest)
amounted to about 36% of CIH's total arrears.  The outstanding balance of this
loan represented 63% of the total hotel portfolio affected by arrears over
5 months, as of December 31, 1971. Even without this loan, the increase in
hotel overdues (from DH 14.3 million in 1970 to DH 26.2 million in 1971) is
significant and reflects the weakness of CIH's supervision activities in the
past, the lack of a systematic collection policy, and, to a certain extent,
deficienQies in past appraisals.
j   Including maturities on loans of less than one year and before provisions
for doubtful loans.
2/  CIH classifies overdue debts as "maturities receivable" when the debt
is overdue for less than five months, and as "arrears" when amounts are
overdue for five months or more. Only the latter category is considered
as delinquent; i.e., at that point penalty interest commences, provisions
are established and legal action may start.



- 15 -
5.06     CIH h&s never experienced a loss on loans related to a mortgaged
house or apartment which had to be sold due to delinquencies. CIH considers
the prospects for recovery in housing arrears satisfactory, particularly
in view of the continuing increase in the value of land.
5.09     CDi's risk rests essentially with its hotel portfolio.  In an
assessment of this risk, the following has to be taken into account:
a. Although about b5% (DH 230.7 million) of CIH's hotel
portfolio represent hotels which have started operation,
more than half of these are still paying only interest
to CIH, because of the long grace periods (up to 5 years)
available on the bulk of CIH's hotel loans.
b. CIH's follow-up and collection procedures have been weak
and have encouraged CIH's clients to delay repayment of
their debts.
5.10     Except for the two cases discussed in the next paragraph, it
appears that CIH's portfolio is basically sound, given the fact that the
bulk of CIH's hotel loans are covered by a 50% State guarantee and that
the mortgages securing these loans in general have a substantial value.
On a conservative basis, CIH's hard core loss prospects (apart from the
two cases reviewed in the next paragraph) should not exceed, say, DH 2-4
million. CIH's'provisions on these losses of DH 5.5 million are thus
adequate.
5.11     Two major hotel clients of CIH, however, are in difficulty.
The Government has an inportant interest in these companies which borrowed
from CIH in 1967-68. CIH's financing of these companies represents about
24% of CIH's hotel portfolio and three times CIH's net worth. The hotel
company mentioned in paragraph 5.07 has been repeatedly in arrears over the
past three years. The other company, which is caught up in a legal dispute
is still benefitting of a six-year grace period on principal and interests
and is not therefore delinquent; the outcome of the dispute may affect CIH
in the long run.    Risks of losses are large enough to put CIH's credit-
worthiness in question. During negotiations for the proposed second
Bank loan, a number of measures were agreed by CIH and the Government
to protect CIH, and have already in part been taken:
a. The amount overdue from loans to the hotel company referred
to in paragraph 5.07 has been entirely paid to CIH. A guarantee
on these loans will be provided to CIH. Because of administrative
and legal delays in Morocco for making such guarantee effective,
an effective guarantee would be a condition of effectiveness for
the proposed Loan.
b. The Government has covered the second case by an irrevocable
agreement toprotect CIH from any loss arising therefrom.



- 16 -
5.12      Provisions Policy.  Until last year, CIH has made provisions
equivalent to the yearly increase in arrears. This policy in the past
enabled CIH to set aside provisions in sufficient amount, until the problews
referred to in the above paragraph occurred. For its 1971 accounts, CIH
started to systematically review its portfolio on a case by case basis
for loans which were delinquent to establish provisions. During negotiations
for the proposed loan, CIH agreed that in the future it would also submit
its loans which are not delinquent to the same scrutiny,and establish
the provisions it needs to cover foreseeable risks on a case by case basis
for all the loans in its portfolio. However, since there may be tax advantages,
CIH might, for the purpose of its published accounts, also continue to make
provisions up to the limit allowed by law, if provisions needed to
cover foreseeable risks were below that level.
5.13      Exosure  Limits.  The large loans in difficulty referred to in
paragraph 5.11 point to the necessity of CIH adopting a policy for limiting
its exposure to hotel development, programs, which call for a large amount
of finance. Such caution - and a policy to that end - is necessary, even
though the Government continues to provide guarantees for half of each
CIH hotel loan.  CIH  agreed  during negotiations  to  normally
limit its financial exposure to a single corporate entity to 20% of CIH's
net worth. (This does not include portion of CIH's loan covered by suitable
guarantees.) Exceptions to this limit could be considered for special
reasons.
Earnings
5.14      In 1971,CIH's net profits reached DH 5.4 million as compared with
DH 4.d million for the preceding year. This amounted to a return of 27%
on share capital and 16% on net worth, as against 24% and 16% respectively
in 1970. In 1971, CIH's net operating income before provisions and taxes
amounted to DH 11.9 million, as against DH 7.6 million in 1970 and DH 7.6
million in 1969. This result is quite satisfactory and reflects the growth
in portfolio. As a result of CIH's new policy on provisions (paragraph 5.12)
there was no new allocation to provisions in 1971. In fact provisions
decreased further in 1971 from DH 6.3 million to DH 5.5 million. These
provisions seem adequate following the agreement reached during negotiations
on how to deal with the   two large projects in difficulty, referred to in
paragraph 5.11. Over the past four years, CIH has maintained an d6 dividend;
this represents a payout ratio of about 55%. CIH's stock is listed on the
Casablanca Stock Market and, although it is not actively traded, its value
has been steadily increling over the past years to DH 145 by the end of 1971.

VI. BUSINESS OUTLOOK
Housing Business
6.01      Housing loans are likely to remain a significant part of CIH's
operations. Buoyancy in demand and the more liberal housing criteria
introduced in June 1969 have resulted in an increase in the number and
value of loan approvals which totalled in 1971 DH 64.4 million, as compared
to DH 37.6 million in 1970. The buoyancy in the housing market is expected
to continue further and CIH projects a continuous increase in the level
of commitments for the years 1972 through 1976, including the financing of
two large apartment development projects in Casablanca and Rabat. CIH's
housing projections (see paragraph 6.03) stand a good chance of being met.
Hotel Business
6.02      CIH's hotel financing business will be affected by the investment
climate and by the Government's policies in the tourism field. Major
elements in such policies are the implementation of critical infrastructure,
the attitude taken toward foreign investors and the incentive system.
6.03      CIH's forecast of operations shown in the table below, is based
to a large extent on hotel applications received by CIH, a large number
of which have already been subjected to preliminary review. Account is
taken of the present uncertainty which delays some foreign sponsored
projects. The hotel loan commitment figures shown in the table below,
DH 31.9 million in 1971 (actual) and DH 115.0 million in 1972 (forecast),
need to be explained. The low level of commitments in 1971 reflected
the general uncertainty of investors. (At the-end of 1971, about DH
60 million of projects approved were uncommitted.) However, DH 27 million
ready for commitment in 1971, were committed at the beginning of 1972.
Thus, a more appropriate commitment figure for 1971 would be DH 58.9,
7eaving DH db million as the forecast of hotel commitments in 1972. The
projections allow for CIH's intention to start financing public sector
hotel projects Which already accouxt in the 1972 forecast for DH 22 million
in commitments. After having worked off its pipeline of firm projects,
CIH might, given improvements of its appraisal capacity, well face a hotel
investment demand that would enable it to maintain its financing of hotels
at about DH 90 million per year of somewhat better. Thus CIH's program of hotel
loans for 1972 thrcugh 1974 calls for loans to perhaps as many as 70 hotels,
including large projects of more than 500 beds each (two with about 1,000
beds), for a total investment cost of about DH 560 million. These
70 hotels would probably have about 1b-19,000 beds and be completed
over the period 1972-1976., The CIH program implies that Morocco would have
a total capacity of about 60,000 beds in 1976, about 50% more than expected
at the end of 1972. If political uncertainties in Morocco do not increase,
CIH's projections appear plausible. CIH's 1972-1976 forecast of both housing
and hotel loans, as compared to actual approvals, commitments and disbursements
follows (in DH million):

Resources Needed
6.o4      On January 1, 1972, CIH had the following uncommitted resources
(DH million):
Local currency      17.5
Foreign exchange      5.4
Total     22.9
On the basis of CIH's expected business over the 5-year period 1972-76, CIH
would have a resource gap of DH 736 million (the details are shown in Annex
15), of which DH 275 million will be needed to finance import needs. With
tourism remaining a priority sector, there is no reason to beLieve that CIH
will fail to obtain the local resources it needsfrom the CDG, the Banque
du Maroc and the Banque du Credit Populaire. Therefore, CIH should face
no difficulty in financing the DH L67 million gap in domestic resources
through medium and long- term borrowings and two increases in share capital
projected during the period. Whether it will obtain the $54 million needed
in foreign exchange is problematic.
6.05      Through the end of 1973, CIH would need to mobilize DH 202 million
in fresh resources (in addition to existing resources and self-generated
funds). As to foreign exchange, CIH will look, at least for the next two
years, exclusively to the Bank for funds to cover the import component of
its hotel loans. TyIpically, the import component in a hotel project amounts
to about 55% of the hotel cost and CIH's lending to hotel, as between local
and foreign currency, reflects this mix. Currently, 55% of CIH's financing



- 19 -
has been directed to foreign procurement and this proportion is expected
to hold for the next two years. Resource needs to finance the import
component of hotels amount to an estimated DH 107 million, i.e. about
$23 million.
6.06       CIH is looking to the Bank to cover the bulk of its need in
foreign exchange. However in lending to CIH the Bank should take into account
that CIH is just emerging from a difficult period and that CIH needs
further strengthening. Also CIH should systematically seek to diversify
its sources of foreign capital so that the Bank would no longer be called
upon to cover CIH's entire foreign exchange requirements. For the proposed
loan, the Bank should therefore cover CIH's needs for a shorter period
than usual, namely only for about eighteen months. (Also, by the end of
this period the discussions between the Bank and the Government on Morocco's
tourism development policy and the related incentive system should have
been well advanced to give the Bank a better base for formulating its long
term lending program to the tourism sector in Morocco.) A $15 million loan
(DH 70 million) would approximately cover CIH's need for eighteen months,
i.e. close to the end of 1973. It would be disbursed as estimated in
Annex 16.
Financial Projections
6.07      Annexes 11 through 13 are CIH's 1972-1976 projected balance
sheets, income statements and cash flow, based on CIH's forecast of
operations in paragraph 7.03. Ratios derived from these projections are
given in Annex 14.
6.o0      Earnnags.  A factor of increasing importance for CIH's income
will be the growing cost of resources due to a large share of Bpnk funds
(assumed to cost 7 1/4% p.a.) in CIH's borrowings. On the average, financial
charges as a percentage of CIH's total assets will grow from 4.5% in 1971
to 5.5% in 1976. The relative cost of administrative expenses is expected
to decrease steadily over the next five years because of likely economies
of scale. Even with the projected growth of business, net income as
compared to average total assets will remain largely unchanged over the
next five years, at about 1%. Revenues derived from CIH's hotel operations
would remain high as compared to revenues from housing,but the latter
will grow in relative importance over the next five years. As shown in
Annex 14, CIHi's profitability over the next five years is also expected
to remain satisfactory: net profits after tax would represent 14-20% of
CIH's share capital over the period, the variation being due to share
capital increases in 1972 and 1974, and about 10% of its net worth.
6.og      Balance Sheets.  CIH's total assets are likely to double over
the next five years. The projected balance sheets raise a few points
of interest:



- 20 -
a.  The declining current ratio position in 1973 and 1974
(1.02 and 1.07 respectively) is explained by large
maturities on medium-term borrowings (5-year bonds)
falling due in these years. However, CIH's cash position
in this period will remain acceptable, provided it has by
then achieved efficient collection procedures.
b.  CIH's debt-service coverage would be adequate throughout
the life of a second Bank loan.
c. CIH's dividend policy (6% of share capital) is reasonable
and allows for a satisfactory growth of reserves.
6.10      CIH plans two share capital increases in 1972 and 1974 of
DH 10 million each. The former was approved by CIH's General Assembly
in 1971 and should be completed in the Fall of 1972. Even with such
increases, CIH would,by the end of 1973,exceed its borrowing limit of
6:1.  (Included in equity for purposes of the debt limit ratio are the
maturities of the DH 30 million subordinated bonds (see Annex 5) falling
due after the last maturities of Bank loans.) Such limit is high for a
company like CIH which provides two-third of its financing to a single
sector.  CIH has agreed to the 6:1 limit and in the next few months will
decide on a new program of equity expansion that will keep it within
this limit.

VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Conclusions
7.01      As the major instrument of the Moroccan Government for financing
hotels, CIH has a crucial role to play in the economic development of
Morocco. Its role in financing hotel and housing construction has been
considerable, particularly during the past five years. CIH's relationship
with the Bank in recent years has had two important results: CIH has
put its financial structure in order; and, in the past year, CIH has
started applying better criteria in selecting hotel projects.
7.02      These results have been made despite the fact that CIH went
through a period of organizational difficulties in 1971. CIH's new
management has already given evidence of its determination to improve
CIH's organization and operation. Still, because of a lack of experienced
staff. there is significant roomfor improvement in CIH 's appraisal of
hotels and in the supervision of its hotel portfolio. While the technical
aspects of project analysis are now adequately handled, the appraisal of
market and financial aspects of hotel projects requires further strengthening.
The Bank has agreed to help CIH locate a senior staff member to provide
assistance in these areas. CIH housing operations are well handled.
7.03      Hotel development, as in earlier years, has benefited greatly
from the Moroccan Government's incentive system. To forestall possible
distorting effects of the incentive system, CIH has agreed to use a minimum
economic rate of return as an acceptability criterion in its appraisal.
This criterion has proved to be a useful tool in screening out marginal
projects. There remain questions, which will have now to be dealt with,
about the utility of the present form and extent of the Moroccan incentive
system. Other policy questions regarding the planning of infrastructure
to support the targeted increase in tourist traffic over the next five
years need to be settled. These matters are important to the work now
underway in Morocco in formulating the country's tourism development
program for 1973-1977. The Bank has offered its advice to the Moroccans
in this effort, and the Moroccan Government has welcomed this offer.
7.o4      CIH's projections are reasonable.  Should the investment
situation improve and the new tourism policy be favorable, CIH could even
expect a higher volume of hotel loans than forecast, but in this case
CIH would have to strengthen its working capacity further.  Moreover,
because tourism is expanding quickly, CIH may have to promote not only
hotel investments, as it now does, but also other types of tourism
investments, such as tourist villas, villages (where entertainment will
play a major role), marinas, camping, and caravaning sites.  CIH should
perhaps also consider equity investments in tourism facilities.

Recommendations
7.05      About 95% of the first Bank loan to CIH   is committed; CIH
will soon need further resources. For the reason stated in paragraph
6.06, a second loan in an amount of US$ 15 million is proposed which
would cover part of CIH's resource needs through the end of 1973. The
measures agreed upon during negotiations to strengthen CIH's portfolio
and particularly to guarantP.- the. loan to two large clients referred to in
paragraph 5.11 indicate that CIH remain creditworthy and a suitable
borrower for a eecond Bank loan.
7.06      As for construction projects financed by the Bank, the proposed
loan would be disbursed to finance:
a.  100A of the CIF cost of imported equipment;
b.  65% of the cost of imported goods, or goods assembled or
processed locally from imported components purchased in Morocco, and
c. a percentage of total construction costs representing
the import component of such costs as established by a
reputable control bureau. The percentages vary as indicated
below:
Class of Hotel         Import Cost Element
5-star          -           37%
4-star          -           36%
3-star         -            31%
2-star         -            24%
1-star         -            20%
7.07      The proposed loan to CIH should be made on the standard
terms and conditions of Bank loans to development finance companies,
including standard commitment fee. In view of the size of CIH's
sub - project),  the free limit above which Bank approval of a project is
required should be raised from $100,000 to $200,000. There should be an
aggregate free limit of us$ 4 million. The Bank will, therefore, continue
to be in a position to review the bulk of the projects being financed
out of the Bank loan.

Tourism Development Incentives
The Government of Morocco has been providing financial and
other incentives to stimulate investments in hotels and vacation villages.
(a) Financial incentives are:
i)   one-time contributions to the fixed investment
cost in the form of grants or rebates, and
ii)   subsidies to operating charges such as interest
rate subsidies and accelerated depreciation.
(b) Other incentives include the benefit of repatriation of
capital and tax guarantees accorded to foreign investors.
To be eligible for any of these incentives, a project has to
be approved by the State's Investment Commission.
I.   Financial Incentives
(a) Interest rate subsidy, a 4.25% p.a. subsidy on the
interest rate payable by hotel investors on long-term loans from CIH
reduces CIH's nominal rate of 8.75% p.a. to an effective rate of 4.50%
p.a.
(b) Equipment grant, a one-time contribution to the fixed
investment costs (excluding the value of land) of a hotel project,
usually ranging from 10% to 15% of the investment cost as estimated
by the State's Investment Commission. The actual equipment grant ap-
proved by the Investment Commission usually ranges from 7.5% to 12.6%
of the actual investment cost.
(c) Rebate of the value added tax charged on the fixed in-
vestment cost, on the average, this benefit amounts to about 6% of the
fixed investment cost (excluding land).
(d) Import duty exemption, applies to construction materials
and new equipment, provided there are no Mcroccan-made products of the
same type available. This benefit is given only to new Drojects or



ANNEX h
Page 2
extensions of existing projects. This benefit amounts to about 1 - 2%
of the fixed investment cost.
(e) Accelerated depreciation. this benefit enables the
invector to double over a five or ten year period, depending upon the
State's Investment Commission decision, the normal rate of depreciation
of assets as follows:  buildings 4% to 5%, heavy equipment 10%, light
equipment up to 20%, vehicles 20% to 33%, and installation costs 50%
to 100%.
(f) Reduction of registration tax. The registration tax for
hotel projects is reduced from 1.5% of share capital to 0.5%; it applies
to both new ventures as well as to existing hotels increasing their
share capital.
(g) Exemption from local taxes. These benefits, notably
income tax advantages, apply only in certain geographic areas.
(h) Reserve fund, a tax-free contingency fund for the pur-
chase of new equipment can be established. The reserve cannot exceed
40% of the investment cost or 50% of any year's past profit and needs to
be reinvested within three years. This advantage is not granted, however,
to projects applying for other tax holidays.
II. Other Incentives
(a)  Foreign investors are guaranteed the repatriation of
profits and of liquidation proceeds.
(b) During the first ten years of the life of a project,
investors are protected against any increase in direct taxes such as
income tax. urban tax, or the "patente."
On the basis of a sample including 15 hotel projects, the
average monetary equivalent of the aforementioned financial government
incentives is as follows:
