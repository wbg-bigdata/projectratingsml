INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDEN T TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED SECOND LOAN TO THE CREDIT IMMOBILIER ET HOTELIER
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR A HOTEL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Credit Immobilier et Hotelier (CIH) with the guarantee of the
Kingdom of Morocco, for the equivalent of US$15 million to help finance
tourism development in Morocco. Amortization would conform substantially
to the aggregate of the amortization schedules applicable to the specific
investment projects to be financed out of the proceeds of the loan. The
interest rate would be 7.25% per annum.
I. THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of Morocco" (Sec. R 71-222) was distributed oh September 20,
1971. An economic mission visited Morocco in April. Its findings are
reflected in the present Report. The Government has asked the Bank to
review the next Five-Year Development Plan (1973-77) presently in pre-
paration. The Bank intends to organize a basic economic mission for
this purpose as soon as the preparation of the new Plan is sufficiently
advanced, possibly in the spring of 1973.
Characteristics
3.        Forming for centuries a well-defined geographical unit between
the Mediterranean, the Atlantic, the Atlas Mountains and the Sahara,
Morocco has developed a distinctive civilization with a traditional
monarchy. Independence was achieved in 1956, after 44 years as a French
protectorate. The Government is highly centralized with supreme power
held by King Hassan II, who acceded to the throne in 1Q61. Arab-Berber
cultures are predominant, and conservative Islamic tradition, in which
the King is the religious as well as the political leader, remains an
important unifying force. France left a deep imprint on culture, busi-
ness and administration, and French is the prevailing language,in govern-
ment circles, and in education above the primary level.
4.        In the period since independence the tra'ditional social and
political order has been essentially maintained while the economic struc-
ture began to change gradually. Traditional subsistence rainfed agricul-
ture still absorbs more than half of the active population. A small but
growing modern type agriculture provides a substantial part of the com-
mercialized agricultural production. Phosphate mining has remained the
major industrial activity. The relative importance of manufacturing
industry is growing only slowly and is oriented toward import substitution.



-2-
The traditional crafts and trades provide substantial employment and
supply the Moroccan population as well as a growing number of tourists.
Construction of hotels and the fast growing tourism traffic have made
tourism the most dynamic sector of the economy. In 1971 foreign ex-
change earnings from tourism amounted to $151 million; from phosphate,
$117 million; from workers remittances, $95 million; and from citrus
exports, $77 million. Major constraints to balanced economic growth
continue to be the vulnerability of agriculture to drought, low savings,
and insufficient dynamism of the private sector, especially in industry.
Unemployment in cities and on the coLutryside is high and large differ-
ences in cultural and economic level between regions and population
groups exist. Rapid growth of the population aggravates the problems.
Policies
5.        The objectives pursued by successive governments since indepen-
dence include: (i) acceleration of economic growth; (ii) preservation
of social and political stability; and (iii) promotion of "Moroccaniza-
tion", i.e. a larger share for Moroccan ownership and management in
foreign-owned land, commercial and financial companies and selected
industries.
6.        The moroccanization policy has been consistent but moderate.
Foreign businesses have not been nationalized with the exception of the
take-over in 1963 of land held under concession by foreign owners. The
number of foreigners declined from 400,000 in 1960 to 100,000 in 1971.
"Moroccanization" of the services sector implies the gradual increase of
the share of Moroccan capital and labor in foreign-owned commercial,
financial and transport concerns, often associated with the expansion of
capital. At the same time new foreign investment in industry, tourism
and mining continues to be encouraged by the Government. Other recent
economic measures include: tariff cuts and trade liberalization on the
occasion of Morocco's association with the Common Market, slight increases
in long-term interest rates applied by certain financial institutions to
reflect better the opportunity cost of capital, and increases in tariffs
for water supply helping to increase public savings in that sector.
7.        The political and social stnructures have been resistant to change,
but the Government recognizes that their stability is increasingly in
question unless growth and change are achieved at a more rapid pace, and
are accompanied by a more equal income distribution. In recent speeches,
the King has stressed several social-economic objectives, in particular
redistribution of income, creation of jobs, land distribution, extension
of education and reform of administration and justice.  A new constitu-
tion has been enacted and a Government formed to prepare elections which
would provide a wider basis for the next administration. The Government
has increased civil servantst basic salaries and workers' minimum wages
by 15%, extended family allowances, introduced a modest progressive income
tax-and reduced the price of sugar, an important consumption item of the
low income classes. It intends to accelerate the distribution of ex-colon
land, to extend pension and health insurance sphemes, to embark on a wide-
scale replacement of slum areas, and to help set up small farms.

Deielopment Plan
80        The 1968-72 Development Plan is nearing completion and a new
Five-Year Plan (1973-77) is under preparation. During the present Plan
period the production growth in most sectors has surpassed the Plan
targets substantially:
(percent average annual growth)
Actual Plan
1968-71 Targets
Agriculture                              6.4     2.1
Energo                                    7.2    5.4
Mining                                    2.1    7.9
Industry and-handicraft                  5.7    4.3
Building and public works                5.9     8.5
Non-government services                  5-4     46
Total (government services excluded)     5.6     4-3
9.        Results in agriculture appear better than they really were be-
cause of a mediocre crop in the base year. But even taking more normal
periods as a base, the average growth of agricultural output has been
about 3.5%, well above expectations. Only mining fell below the Plan
target. largely because competition on the world phosphate market de-
pressed production, and 1971 output was only three quarters of the volume
planned. Prospects have recently improved and the government phosphate
company expects to reach the Plan target in 1973. Most other mining de-
clined due to depletion of resources.  The political events of mid-summer
1971 had limited immediate effect on the overall growth rate. The acce-
leration in manufacturing output and construction activity was interrupted,
but good weather helped to increase agricultural output. Total production
_..-reazed by 5%in real terms, only slightly lower than that of the pre-
ceding three years.
10.       The volume of total fixed investment increased by 6% annually
during the 1968-71 period, slightly lower than was assumed in the Plan.
Central Government investments accounted for about half of the total and
was close to the targets which were revised upward in 1969. About 70% of
the government investment program in agriculture was allocated to large
scale irrigation schemes. While dam construction proceeded on schedule,
land preparation lagged behind and progress with regard to rainfed agri-
culture and livestock was slow. Construction of power stations is in
line with Plan targets. Other government investments did not differ by
more than 10% from Plan targets except for delays in investments for
urban development, health, education and communications.
11.       Since the abortive coup of July 1971, many private investors
seem to be awaiting the outcome of the political reorganization which iB
under way, and public investments have also been stagnant largely due to
some reconsideration of policies and changes in cabinet and civil service.
Total fixed capital formation in 1971 dropped by about %o in real terms



-4-
and represented 14.1% of GDP.  Consumer demand was sustained by good crops
and the social measur'es taken by the Government since mid-1971. The im-
pact of these measures on government savings was offset by better perfor-
mance of public enterprises, while the good crops and remittances from
emigrant workers stimulated private savings.  However, total gross national
savings remain around 12%o of GDP, which is low for a country at Morocco's
stage of development. The current account deficit was reduced from $144
million to $78 million, and thanks to larger public capital inflow and SDR
allocation, the reserve position improved and reached a level of $235
million in March 1972, equivalent to about two and a half months of im-
ports of goods.
Development Prospects
12.       Appropriate fiscal, monetary and trade policies could ensure
that GDP will continue to grow at about.5% per year until 1977. However,
to achieve this modest target, per capita annual consumption would have
to be limited to 1.5%. This would not be easy in view of the increased
attention given by the Government to social progress, but would be neces-
sary because a growth rate of 5% would require savings and investments to
be raised from about 12%o and 14% of GDP respectively to 14% and 17% of
GDP in 1977. The other growth assumptions could probably be achieved
without major difficulty. On the basis of present trends, foreign aid
disbursements in 1977 might be projected as follows, although the actual
flow will depend on future commitments still to be made by the respective
donors:
(millions of dollars)
Annual Average    Actual   Projection
1966/68  1969/71    1971    -21977
Bilateral                      112      125       144        156
USA                             48)       56)     (56)       (6)
France                          59)       27)      30)        54)
Germany                        (19)      (17)      28         17)
Other Countries                 ( 6)     (25)     (3O         49)
Bank Group                      11       18        25         59
Total Gross Official Flow      123      143      169         215
Repayments                      45       50       64         95
Net Offical Flow                78       93       105        120
13.       While the above projections appear feasible, the Government's
targets are likely to be more ambitious .  It is considering an annual
growth target of 6.5% for the next Five-Year Plan, and is working out its
implications.  These would clearly include stronger growth of gross na-
tional savings and additional foreign aid. If more aid could be obtained,
it would be desirable for it to be on concessionary terms, since the terms



-5-
of aid which is already in prospect are likely to deteriorate as a result
of the decline in grants, especially from the United States, and of the
increase in medium-term credits which would be the normal form of part of
the projected larger French aid.
External Debt
14.       Disbursed foreign debt is at present $804 million and may grow
to about $1,500 million in 1977. The debt service ratio may rise from
8.9% in 1971 to 12% in 1977 and further thereafter.  While Morocco remains
creditworthy for substantial additional loans on conventional terms, a
substantial proportion of new external assistance should be made available
on concessional terms if the growth of the debt service burden is to be
restrained in the long run. The share of the Bank Group in Morocco's total
outstanding external debt is increasing. From about 7% at the end of 1968
it had reached 10% at the end of 1971 and may rise to 20% by the end of
1975. Projects already approved and those under consideration would lead
to disbursements equivalent to about one fifth of Morocco's projected
foreign capital needs in the mid-seventies.
II. BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MOROCCO
15.       Bank and IDA lending since the first Bank Group project in 1962
amounts to $211.4 million, net of cancellations, for 12 projects, three
of which were financed under IDA credits totalling $28.4 million. These
loans have helped finance industry ($85 million), agriculture ($71.1 mil-
lion), transportation ($14.6 million), education ($10.5 million), and
tourism ($17 million). IFC has made investments totalling $2.4 million
in the Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Economique (BNDE) and a
canning factory. Annex I contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA
credits and IFC investments as of May 31, 1972 and notes on the execution
of on-going projects with particular reference to those which are encoun-
tering problems.
16.       The Bank Group strategy is to respond to the requirements of
Morocco's economic and social objectives, which appear in line with most
previous Bank recommendations. Specifically the Bank Group program aims
at assisting Morocco in maintaining a growth of GDP at roughly 5% per year,
the rate achieved in the recent past, financing key projects in priority
sectors, and devising and implementing policies to limit unemployment,
develop agriculture and improve urban and rural living conditions. It
contemplates primarily lending from the Bank, but with some blending of
IDA funds, in order to moderate the build-up of external debt service
requirements.  In the last three years, Bank and IDA lending ranged between
$45 and $75 million. Projects now in course of preparation could lead to
a higher level of lending of the next two or three years, but this much
depends upon Morocco's capacity to prepare projects, upon solving the
defficulties encountered in creating new institutions or in improving
existing ones and upon finding competent management.



Sectors and Projects
17        The key sectors on which the Bank concentrates its action are
agriculture, tourism, urban infrastructure, industry for export and trans-
port. Amongst these key sectors, agriculture and urban infrastructure
provide special opportunities to help devise and implement policies re-
sponding to the Government's new emphasis on social developmient.
18.       In agriculture the proposed $34 million second financing for
agricultural credit would help develop modern farming. The problems of
traditional agriculture would be dealt with through a project for the
integrated development of rainfed agriculture now being prepared with the
help of the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program; this project would combine con-
solidation, basic infrastructure, soil preparation and credit, and could
have a substantial effect on rural underemployment. It may be ready for
consideration by FY 1974. A study of the Oum er Rbia basin development
was recently completed in cooperation with the Bank, and an irrigation
scheme is now under preparation. Originally planned for financing in FY
1972, it has been postponed to FY 1974 because of delays in initiating
the feasibility studies. The Bank is also helping the Government define
and prepare a project to develop the production of off-season fruits and
vegetables for export.
19.       Tourism has becomne the largest source of foreign exchange for
Morocco and its further expansion should help finance the substantial im-
ports necessary for future development. Besides it financing of CTH,
the Bank might also be Executing Agency for a proposed UNDP study which
could lead to a tourism infrastructure project for VY 197T, and it is
helping the Government to coordinate a number of other studies and reviews
of the sector.
20.       Urban infrastructure projects include one for bulk water supply
in the Casablanca-Rabat region for which a $48 million loan will be pre-
sented shortly to the Executive Directors, to be followed by a second pro-
ject in FY 1974. A Bank sector mission has recently reviewed the Govern-
ment's proposed urbanization policies and idetified a site and service
project which may be ready for financing in FY 1974. Finally, a power
project planned for FY 1973 is designed to meet urban needs.
21.       The Government is now placing more emphasis on exports.   The
Bank has assisted this orientation through an industrial review completed
18 months ago and is now helping define the required policies and the
measures to implement them, particularly in manufacturing and mining. In
this line, the Bank is considering two proposed loans for FY 1973, i.e. a
sixth loan to the industrial development bank (BNDE) and a loan for a
phosphoric acid plant whose production would be entirely exported.
22.       Morocco's transport network requires some expansion to meet
growing needs. After a first loan to finance the road between Marrakesh



-7
and Agadir and a transport survey, a transport sector mission visited the
country in late 1971. A second road project is now under preparation for
presentation in FY 1973. A port expansion project may also be ready for
Py 1974.
23.       Education represents a major bottleneck in Morocco's development:
students represent a low proportion of the school age population, the pro-
portion of drop-outs is high, curricula are not well-adapted to economic
development, graduates are too frequently unable to use the skills acquired
and, as a result, unrest in the student population is high, leading to
strikes and a further lowering of the standard of education. If this de-
terioration is allowed to continue social stability could be affected while
the qualified personnel needed to ensure economic expansion would be lack-
ing. Projects for education in Morocco undoubtedly have a high priority;
two credits already have been made and another is planned for FY 1974.
However, its presentation will depend on a substantial improvement in the
execution of the first two projects and on the completion of the study of
higher education whose financing is included in the second credit (Annex I
C. para. 2.
Other Assistance
24.       A Consultative Group for Morocco was formed in April 1967.  The
Group is chaired by the Bank and includes Belgium, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Kuwait, The Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United
States, IFl, UNDP, OECD/AAC, African Development Bank and European Invest-
ment Bank. At its last meeting, in October 1971, the Group welcomed the
Government's new policies and affirmed continued support.
III. THE TOURISM SECTOR
25.       Morocco is particularly well-endowed for tourism.   It is close
to Western Europe, one of the two major sources of tourists in the world;
about one quarter of all visitors to Morocco come from France, about 10%
each from Great Britain and Germany, about 206 from the rest of Europe,
and almost 20% from North America. Morocco has many attractive beaches
on the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, and a great variety of scenery,
from fertile coastal regions with historic citis, to the Atlas Mountains
and the Sahara desert. Morocco enjoys more diversified tourist resources
and easier access by motor car than its North African competitors, and
it has a longer season and a distinctly more exotic atmosphere than its
competitors to the north of the Mediterranean.
26.       Tourism is one of Morocco's most dynamic sectors and the leading
source of foreign exchange earnings and the financing of hotels by CIH has
played an important role in this growth. Tourist arrivals increased by
nearly 20% annually from 1967 to 1970. In 1971, the political uncertain-
ties following the abortive coup d'etat in mid-July as well as a few
cholera cases depressed the growth rate to only 7.4%. The number of visi-
tors is expected to be about 1.1 million in 1972 and is forecast to reach
2.7 million in 1977.



27.       Total employment from tourism is estimated at 40,000 workers,
about one half in hotels and the other half in tourism-connected jobs
outside hotels, together representing about 2.4% of the active labor
force outside agriculture. Hotel employment may double by the end of
1976. The investment per job created in hotels amounts to about $10,000,
a figure well below the corresponding figure in manufacturing industry.
Significant secondary employment is also created in construction, trains-
portation, hotel supplies and other activities stimulated by tourism.
28.       Investments in tourism during the Plan period (1965-72)are
estimated at DH 450 million or about 3.5% of total national investments.
These investments have also resulted in significant development of sup-
plier's industries such as cement, wood and other construction materials,
the output of which has increased at an average of about 11h% over the
past three years.
29.       Despite Morocco's natural advantages and the rapid growth of
tourism in the last few years, the sector is not without problems. Morocco's
annual growth of tourist arrivals over the last five years has been below
that of Tunisia (over 25%), which is competing for the same market. Rising
occupancy rates show that demand for accommodation is outpacing hotel ca-
pacity. Hotel capacity, which was 19,000 beds at the beginning of the
1968-72 Development Plan, had risen to 35,700 beds at the end of 1971 and
is expected to be only 40,000 beds at the end of 1972, which is well short of
the Plan target of l19,000 beds. This reflects the insufficient govern-
ment encouragements to investors to build modern mass tourism accomoda-
tions.
30.       The Government applies a number of incentives for hotel con-
struction, the two most important being an equipment grant and an interest
subsidy on CIH's hotel loans. The equipment grant, which is subject to
approval on a case by case basis by the Investment Commission, may be up
to 15% of fixed investment cost, but does not usually exceed 10%. The
interest rate subsidy is 4.25% per annum and brings CIH's nominal rate of
8.75% down to an effective rate of 4.5% for the investor; this rebate is
granted automatically. There are in addition import duty exemptions, re-
bates on the value-added tax and accelerated depreciation allowances.
These incentives for tourism investment, taken together, may amount to
more than 30% of the investment cost of a hotel project, and tourism
would probably not have grown to the present extent without them.
However, there is evidence that the incentive policy could be improved by
more selective application and that it would be useful to examine whether
the incentives have contributed to an optimum allocation of resources in
the tourism sector.
31.       These incentives will be compared to those in force in Tunisia,
Spain, France, Italy, Yugoslavia and Greece, in the planned Bank review of
incentives in the Mediterranean area, but at present Moroccan incentives
do not appear out of line with those in these countries.   The Government is also
embarking on several studies as a first step towards ah overall review of its
tourism sector which should lead to an improved strategy for tourism development.
Such strategy would include the development of tourism infrastructure, streng-



-9-
thening of institutions serving tourism and a well-defined policy towards
foreign and local investors including, in particular, an improved incen-
tive system.
32.       The Bank started financing tourism projects in September 1966
when it agreed that part of a loan to Banque Nationale de Developpement
Economique (BNDE) could be relent to CIH for hotel financing. CIH had at
that time only limited experience in hotel lending because its primary
activity since its creation in 1920 had been the provision of mortgage
and housing financing. However, CIH moved increasingly away from its
mortgage-oriented outlook and became a hotel financier, giving increased
weight to the commercial prospects and soundness of a hotel venture and
achieving a measure of familiarity with the methods and operations of the
Bank.  In view of this development and of the Government's wish that CIm
be the prime source of loans for tourism accommodations in Morocco, the
Bank made a first $10 million loan directly to CM in August 1970.
33.       The Bank has also reviewed the tourism sector regularly in con-
nection with its evaluation of Morocco's economic performance. Tourism
being of growing importance both for the Moroccan economy and for Bank
lending in Morocco, the Bank has offered its assistance in the work now
under way in formulating the tourism part of the next development plan.
Bank missions have been discussing the incentive system for tourism in-
vestments and other aspects of tourism policies with the Government, and
close consultation will continue. They also helped to prepare terms of
reference for a study of the infrastructure needed for the Bay of Agadir
one of the foremost tourist areas of the country. This latter study will
probably be financed by UNDP, with the Bank as Executing Agency.
IV. THE PROJECT.
34.       An appraisal report on CmH (No. DB 93-a) dated June 1, 1972, is
being distributed separately. A Loan and Project Summary is attached as
Annex III. The Bank's first loan to CIH will soon be fully committed to
hotel projects. The proposed second CIE project was first appraised in
April 1971.  For the reasons given in paragraph 40, a reappraisal became
necessary  and   took place in January/February 1972. Negotiations for
the proposed loan were held in Washington in May 1972. CIH was repre-
sented by Messrs. Mohamed Benchekroun, its Director General, and the
Guarantor by Messrs. M'hamed Tazi and Lotfallah Cheggour of the Ministry
of Finance.
CIH's Objectives and Role in the Economy
35.       CIH has played a major role in the economy for some years, first
in financing urban housing, but increasingly, since 1962, in financing
hotels and vacation villages. CIH continues to provide mortgage financing
for houses and apartments, and this part of its operations is efficient.



_ 10 -
In recent years, it has assumed a significant role in the growth of
tourism and has been associated with two thirds of the commitment for
hotel investments in Morocco in the years 1969-71. From the beginning
of its hotel financing activities, CIH has signed 244 loans with 123
hotel enterprises.
36.       The economic returns on CIH-financed hotels are good.   CIH has
subjected Bank-financed hotel projects to a minimum economic return test
of 10% which has become a primary tool of CIM's appraisal, and has led
CIH to advise hotel investors on how to prepare better projects. The
average rate of return on Bank-financed projects has been about 16%.
37.       CIH faces a strong demand for finiancing new houses in major
cities and resort areas. (Other specialized institutions cater to finan-
cing needs for housing in rural areas.) CIE provides mortgage financing
for middle class housing and since more liberal policy for housing loans
was introduced in 1969, CIE's housing business has increased substantially.
Resources
38.       About 55% of CIX's share capital of DE 20 million is held by
public institutions, including the Caisse de Depots et de Gestion (CDG)
(34.1%), the Banque de Maroc (10%) and other public entities (9.5%).
Private shareholders, predominantly Moroccan, own the remaining 45%.
Over the period 1968-71, CIH raised resources amounting to DH 350 million.
About 56% of its needs were met from CDG, the Banque du Maroc and the
Banque du Credit Populaire, another 23% came from the World Bank, indirectly
from 1966 to 1970 through BNDE and directly thereafter when it received
its first Bank loan. CIM has also tapped the narrow capital market in
Morocco by a public issue of long-term bonds of DH 15 million. Except for
Barnk loans, CIH has not borrowed abroad but CIH and the Government are
aware that the Bank will not cover CIH's entire foreign exchange require-
ments in the long run. Recently, CIH has established contacts with poten-
tial foreign lenders, and it was urged during negotiations to pursue and
intensify these contacts.
Management and Organization
39.       CIE's Board counts 13 members, including 8 public sector represen-
tatives. There is also a seven-member Executive Committee with the Director
General as a voting member, which meets about every month to consider all
proposed projects. However, it rarely discusses details of investment pro-
posals. After five years with CIH, the Director General, Mr. Mohamed Lazrak,
resigned in April 1971 to become Minister of Tourism. His successor is Mr.
Mohamed Benchekroun, a former Director of the Budget in the Finance Ministry.
40.       After the departure of Mr. Lazrak, CIH's organization also sufferea the
departure of several key executives.  To deal with the ensuing problems,
the new Director General embarked on a major reorganization and appointed
new senior personnel. Results of these measures are encouraging. Total



CIHI staff now amounts to 80, including 41 professionals. CIH is divided
into a Credit Department (consisting of housing and hotel lending divisions),
and a Finance Department. The latter has experienced personnel and per-
forms its functions satisfactorily. The Credit Department needs streng-
thening and CIH proposes to engage a senior executive with experience in
hotel financing, particularly in market assessment, appraisal and follow-up,
promotion and staff training. At CIG's request, the Bank is helping to
find such an officer. At the lower eschelons, the present staff appears
adequate for CIH's needs.
41.       The appraisal of hotel projects has recently improved, though
better judgment on market aspects is still needed. Technical work on
hotel proj'Dcts is well-handled by experienced engineers. Greater improve-
ments are needed in project supervision, an area which now has the
Director General's full attention. Some aspects of loan collection work
are also being tightened. Hotel investors are now required to retain con-
sultants (bureaux de controle) for the review and supervision of larger
projects. This has proved a useful practice. CIE is currently trying to
find ways to have the consulting engineers intervene at an earlier stage
of project execution when they can play a more constructive role.
42.       Procurement practices are generally satisfactory.  Competitive
bidding is arranged in most cases by investors for the various elements
of their projects, but CIE relies essentially on its general experience
about prices and contracts and reacts when these are substantially out of
line with established norms. CIE has agreed to strengthen its procurement
practices and to enlist the l"burea%ude controle" in this task.
43.       CIH's disbursement procedures are adequate; verification of
expenditures is carefully controlled. However, disbursements under the
first Bank loan were only $1.3 million aS of May   31, 1972, against $9
million committed, because CIZ met difficulty in obtaining from its clients
oome of the supporting documentation for its Bank withdrawal applications.
This matter has now been resolved.
Operations
L4.       Between 1968 and 1971, about 1,800 housing loans amounting to
DR 127 million were approved, most of them in the medium price range.
During the same period, CIE approved 174 hotel loans for DE 175 million.
CIH's hotel portfolio has a substantial number of large loans (15 loans
over DH 5 million represented about 50% of all outstanding loans at the
end of 1971) and a decreasing share of loans to high-clas category hotels.
This development is welcome because demand for accommodation is stronger
in lower class categories which cater to mass tourism.
45.       CIH's hotel loans carry a nominal interest rate of 8.75% and
the State usually guarantees 50%0 of the outstanding balance of CIE's loans.
Hotel loans are limited to 20 years for construction with five years of
grace, and to 10 years for equipment withl two years of grace. CIH pro-
vides btween 40% and 55% of the investment cost. Pending the outcome



- 12 -
of the work Morocco is now carrying out in consultation with the Pink on the
country's tourism policies and related investor incentives, CIH's lending
terms, including its effective rate on hotel loans (paragraph 50), will
probably not be modified.
Financial Results and Portfolio
46.       CIH's accounts, in 1969 and 1970, were audited by Price Water-
house and certified without qualification.  The audit of CIH's 1971 ac-
counts is completed.  The report is expected momentarily, and the audi-
tors have informed us orally that it is satisfactory.  CIH's balance
sheets and income statements are summarized in Annex III (page 2). For
the period 1968-71, they reflect a continuing growth in CIH's volume of
business, although during 1971 the portfolio increased by 16% only as
compared with 45% in 1970, solely because commitments for hotel loans
declined in 1970 and 1971. CIH's liquidity position is sound. As of
D)ecember 31, 1971, CIH's current ratio was 1.8, about the same as at the
end of 1970. At the same time, the ratio of long-term borrowing to net
worth was 5:1 as compared with the 6:1 limit specified in the first and
proposed second Loan Agreement.     .
47.       CIm's loans in arrears increased considerably during 1971.  As
of December 31, 1971, amounts of principal and interest overdue for more
than five months represented about 3.6% of CIR's total portfolio, as com-
-ared with 2.0% in 1970.  The deterioration is almost exclusively attri-
butalle to hotel loans and particularly to a loan of IH 30 millior to one
large hotel company, whose arreats (all interest) represent about 56% of
CUq's total arrears. As of December 31, 1971, the outstanding balance of
the loan to this company amounted to 65% Of the total hotel portfolio af-
fected by arrears over five months. Even without this loan, the increase
in hotel arrears (from DE 14.3 million in 1970 to IE 26.2 million in 1971)
is significant and reflects the weakness of 071's supervision in the past,
the lack of.a systematic collection policy and,-to a certain extent,
insufficiently thorough appraisals.  CTii has recently introduced more
aggressive collection procedures which should help reduce arrears consi-
derably.
48.       In addition to the hotel mentioned above, another major hotel
client of CIE is in difficulty.  The Government has an important financial inte-
rest in both. (LMts financing of these companies, dating from 1967-68, repre-
S4Hts- about 2L4% of its hotel portfolio and three times its net worth.
The first hotel mentioned has repeatedly been in arrears over the past
three years. The other client, which is involved in a legal dispute, is
still benefitting from a six-year grace period on principal and interest
and is not therefore delinquent; but the outcome of the dispute may affect
CUH in the long run. Because the risk of loss on the loans to these com-
parlies is large enough to put CIE's creditworthiness in question, the
Government has paid to CIE the amount overdue from the first company and
has arranged that a guarantee on the balance'of that loan will be provided
to CIH. It has also guaranteed to hold CIH h6rmless from any losses on
the loars to the second hotel client.  These arrangements make CIH a
cre&atvorthy borrower.



49,      I-fI's other risks rest also essent-ally wyith its hotel portfolio,, but,
except for the two cases discussed above, the portfolio is basically
sound, since the bulk of C0H's hotel loans is covered by a 50% state
guarantee and the mortgages securing these loans have a substantial value.
On a conservative estimate, CIEts haxd core loss prospects (apart from
the two mentioned oases in the previous paragraph) should not exceed
DI 2.0-4.0 million. CTE's provisions Against these losses of DE 5.5
million are thus adequate.
50.       Until last year, OMH automatically made provisions equivalent
to the yearly increase in arrears. They were sufficient except for the
problems described in the preceding paragraphs. For its 1971 acoounts,
CIE started to scrutinize each of the delinquent loans in its portfolio
to determine its appropriate provision. In the future, GCE will examine
all its loans including those not delinquent and establish the provisions
required for all foreseeable risks.
51.       The problems with the two large loans referred to above, make
it cleax that CIH needs to limit its exposure to individual borrowers,
even though the Government continues to provide guarantees for half of
each outstanding hotel loan. In future, therefore, CIH will normally
limit loans to a single corporate entity not coveredb,by government or
other suitable guarantees to 20% of its net worth.
52.       In 1971, CIH's net profits reached IR 5.4 million as compared
with DH 4.8 million for the preceding year. This represented a return
of 27% on share capital and 16% on net worth, as against 24% and 16%,
respectively, in 1970. Net operating income before provisions and taxes
amounted to DR 11.9 million in 1971 as against DE 7.8 million in 1970.
As a result of CM'Us new provisions of policy, provisions decreased in
1971 from DE 6.3 million to DR 5.5 million. Over the past four years,
CIH has maintained an 8% dividend which represents a payout ratio of
about 55%.
Operational and Financial Projections
53.       Housing loans are likely to remain an important part of C0s's
operations. Buoyant demand and more liberal lending criteria are likely
to lead to a significant increase in lending. In CIH's five-year forecast,
commitments for housing loans are expected to rise from DR 48.5 million
in 1971 to DE 55 million in 1972 and to DE 65 million in 1976. These
targets have a good chance of being met.
54.       CIE3's hotel financing business is also expected to increase con-
siderably. Commitments are expected to rise from DE 88 million in 1972
to DE 110 million in 1976. These projections include public sector hotel
projects which account for DE 22 million in the forecast of 1972 commit-
ments. If the investment climate improves and the Government's tourism
policy is successful, CIE's hotel lending projections appear plausible.
55.       To meet commitments of about DE 795 million during 1972-76, C0I
would have to raise new resources of IH 736 million, after deducting



- 14 -
uncommitted funds and self-generated resources.  The gap in local re-
sources amounts to IH 467 million which CIII should be able to cover through
recourse to public funds and increases in share capital. As to foreign
resources, CIH expects to need US$54 million equivalent to finance the
import component of hotel projects during 1972-76.
56.       CIH's foreign exchange requirements for hotel loans for the next
18 months are forecast at US$15 million equivalent, and this would be pro-
vided by the proposed Bank loan. By covering CIH's foreign exchange needs
only to this extent, the Bank takes into account that although the im-
provement in CTH's operations is real, it is recent and further progress
is required. CIH will attempt to diversify its sources of capital so
that the Bank would no longer be called upon to cover its entire re-
quirement for import financing, although it may take some time tfor
CIH to establish itself with other lenders. CIH is aware that possible
further Bank lending would be related to its success in this regard.
57.       The growing cost of resources arising from the larger share of
Bank funds in CIE's borrowings will influence CMH's income. On the average,
financial charges as a percentage of CIH's total assets will grow from 4.8%
in 1971 to 5.5% in 1976. However, the share of administrative expenses
in CIH's total income is expected to decrease steadily over the next five
years, because of economies of scale. As a result, net income as compared
with average total assets will remain largely unchanged at about 1%. over
the next five years. Revenues derived from CIH's hotel operations are
expected to remain high as compared with revenues from housing, but the
latter will grow in relative importance over the next five years. CII's
profitability over the next five years is expected to remain satisfactory:
net profits after tax would represent 14-20% of CIH's share capital and
about l10, of its net worth.
58.       CIm's total assets are likely to double over the next five years.
The current ratio will decline in 1973 and 1974 to 1.02 and 1.07, respec-
tively, because large maturities on medium-term borrowings (five-year
bonds) will be falling due in these years. However, CIH's cash position
in this period will remain acceptable, provided more efficient collection
procedures can be achieved. Debt service coverage would be adequate
throughout the life of a second Bank loan. Dividend policy (8% of share
capital) is reasonable and will allow for a satisfactory growth of reserves.
59.       CIH plans two share capital increases of Dii 10 million, one in
1972 and one in 1974. The former was approved by CIH's General Assembly
in 1971 and should be completed in the fall of 1972. Even with such in-
creases, CIE would exceed its borrowing limit of 6:1 by the end of 1973.
If an important part of CIE's loans were not covered by government
guarantees, this limit would already be too high for a company like CIE
which provides two thirds of its financing to a single sector. In the next
few months CIH will prepare additional proposals to expand its equity so
as to remain within its borroVSng limit.

Terms of the Proposed Loan
60.       The proposed loan to CIH follows the terms and conditions of
recent loans to development finance companies, including the standard
commitment charge. In view of the growing size of CIH's sub-projects,
the free limit above which Bank approval of a project is required would
be raised from $100,000 to $200,000, and the aggregate free limit would
be $4 million. The Bank would thereby continue to review the bulk of the
projects being financed out of the Bank loan. The proposed loan would be
disbursed to finance 100% of the CIF cost of imported equipment; 65% of
the cost of imported equipment or equipment assembled or processed locally
from imported components, if purchased in Morocco; and the foreign ex-
change component of construction costs.
61.       CIH is continuing its important role in the Moroccan economy.
Its new management is determined to strengthen its organization and pro-
cedures. After the elimination of the specific risks in its portfolio
by the measures mentioned above, CIH is creditworthy for the proposed
loan.
V. LEGAL INSTRUYMNTS AIND AUTHORITY
62.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Credit Immobilier
et Hotelier, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Kingdom of Morocco
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans
for development finance companies. The effectiveness of the Agreements
would be conditional on the Borrower's obtaining from the Guarantor and
from the Caisse Centrale de Garantie, a governmental institution, full
guarantees covering the DI 30 million loan of the Borrower described above.
63.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
VI. RECOMMDATION
64.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.      Projects in Execution
1.      Delays in disbursements of several loans and credits have been
caused mainly by cumbersome budgetary and accounting procedures, and
administrative inefficiency in submitting disbursement applications,
rather than byT delays in the execution of the project. A Bank disburse-
ment officer visited Morocco last November to investigate the problems
and propose solutions. During the recent negotiations further improve-
ments and streamlining of procedure were agreed upon.
2.      Considerable delays have been, and still are, affecting the
execution of the education credits (79 and 266-MOR). Disbursements
under the first credit have been extremely slow and the Closing date
had to be extended twice, from the original date of June 30, 1971 to
March 31, 1973; disbursements under the second credit have not yet
started, ten months after signing. Project implementation has been
affected by inadequate management of the project unit, insufficient
control of construction works, departures from agreed procedures for
procurement, and lack of coordination. The higher education study
needed to prepare a proposed third loan is not yet started. Despite
numerous supervision missions, little progress has so far been achieved.
This situation is under constant review and a new schedule for project
implementation has just been sent to the Government.
3.      The Sebou irrigation loan (643-MoR) is progressing satisfactorily.
Redistribution of expropriated properties to small landowners started more
slowly than expected because of delays in enacting the necessary legis-
lation. Substantial cost increases on a number of important items are
becoming apparent and as soon as they are reviewed, the Bank will discuss
with the Government their consequence for the financing of the project.
4.      The first highway financing (167 and 642-MOR), mainly for the
Agadir-Marrakesh road, is progressing satisfactorily from a technical
standpoint. However, only $2.7 million has yet been withdrawn out of
a combined loan/credit amounting to $14.6 million. The Effective date
was March 16, 1970, and the Closing date is February 28, 1974. The
situation is being reviewed with the Government.
