I. THE EDUCATION SECTOR
Socio-Economic Background
1.01     Morocco's Five-Year National Development Plan (1981-85) has set a
target growth rate for GDP (real terms) of 6.5% based on export-led growth
concentrated in the manufacturing, mining anc, energy sectors (food processing,
mineral by-products and energy substitution) and expansion of agriculture and
fishing to achieve self-sufficiency in food production. The achievement of
these objectives is largely contingent on thE nation's capacity and use of
high level scientific manpower. The Government's concern, in this respect, is
reflected in the priority given to developing teacher training programs for
teachers of mathematics and science and on the emphasis being given to science
and math at all levels of the education and training system.
1.02     The Plan continues to place high pr:iority on social development, on a
more equitable distribution of income and the provision of social services,
particularly in rural areas. The sub-sector goals include equitable and
efficient growth of the education system, focussed on the manpower and
ejmployment requirements of the country. Priority is given to the provision of
economically built primary schools, especialLy in disadvantaged areas, and the
improvement of the quality of instruction, especially of science and math
through the provision of relevant educational learning aids to primary schools
and the training of an adequate number of well-trained secondary teachers.
Sector Background
1.03     The Ministry of Education (MOE) is responsible for formal education
and training which includes primary, general and technical secondary, and
post-secondary education (technical training institutes, teacher training
institutes and the College of Applied Engineering) as well as the universities
(see Chart I - Structure of the Education and Training System).  The Ministry
of Planning (MOP) oversees the planning and coordination of vocational and
technical training outside the formal education system. The Office of
Vocational Training and Employment (OFPPT), with administrative and financial
autonomy under the umbrella of the MOP, is responsible for all middle and
lower level vocational, technical and apprernticeship training in private
sector industrial and commercial establishments.
1.04     Considerable progress has been achieved in attaining the Government's
quantitative objectives. Between 1973 and :980, primary and secondary
enrollments increased 6.4% and 10.6% per year and 3.5 times in the
universities. It is estimated that 72% of i:he primary age group (7-11), 28%
junior secondary (12-15), 14% senior secondary (16-18), and 4.5%
post-secondary were enrolled in schools in L980.  The proportion of girls in
total enrollments, 37% in primary and junior secondary and 32% in senior
secondary, is about average for a country of Morocco's stage of development.
Measures have been taken to reorientate education from the more theoretical
content and methodology inherited from the aolonial period towards applied



-2-
science and technology. A practical "hands on" activities program (third
education project) has now been extended to 120 primary schools (para. 1.16),
a new subject "Introduction to Technology" (third education project) has been
included in the junior secondary curriculum and is being progressively
extended to schools at this level, and the planned shift in enrollments from
the arts to the math/science option in secondary (55% of senior secondary
enrollments) has been achieved. A major breakthrough in technical education
and training is anticipated with the completion (1985) of 11 technical
secondary schools included in the Bank-assisted fourth education project
(providing a total enrollment capacity of 27,500, an increase of 60%) and the
achievement of full enrollment capacity (1982) in the four new university
faculties of science (an increase from about 4,000 enrollments in 1977 to
15,000 in 1981).
1.05     The implementation of the Government's strategy to achieve its goals
has been constrained by a number of factors. The strong demand for education
by a rapidly growing population (3% per annum since 1971) has resulted in the
educational system expanding more rapidly than the availability of resources
(teachers, educational equipment and school buildings). Demographic and
cultural factors (a population density estimated at 60-140 persons per km2 in
the north and west compared to 15 in the south and east) have made the
provision of educational facilities in the less densely populated areas both
difficult and expensive, resulting in significant disparities in the
distribution of educational opportunities between regions and sexes (the
intake of girls is 46% in urban schools compared with 23% in rural areas and
less than 20% in the sparsely populated south).  The rapid growth of the
education system has been accompanied by serious qualitative problems
reflected in high repeater, drop-out and failure rates, attributed in large
part to entrenched traditional curricula, a lack of educational equipment and
materials in primary and secondary schools and a scarcity of well-trained
science and math teachers, particularly at the upper secondary level. The
Government's educational priorities in the Plan are specifically designed to
redress these constraints upon the achievement of its long-term goals (para.
1.13).
Educational Issues
1.06     The rapid expansion of the educational system since 1973 has been
accompanied by significant qualitative problems. The Government is aware of
these problems and has recently established a National Commission for
Educational Reform to deal with them. The items of the proposed project would
not be affected by these reforms, in any case, because the Government has
agreed that they would form an essential part of any education and training
strategy. The major current problems in the sector are:
1.07     Efficiency;  Low efficiency, indicated by the high repeater, drop-out
and failure rates obtaining at all levels of the system, has resulted in high
costs and limited the system's capacity to absorb new admissions. In 1980,
the Government estimated that 21%, 15% and 23% of the students in primary,
junior secondary and senior secondary schools, respectively, leave school
before their final year and 79%, 60% and 50% repeat at least two grades before
sitting the final exams at each level. This has resulted in a very high cost,
expressed in years of instruction per student, of 8.6, 5.3 and 4.2 years,
respectively. Within the university system, the average repeater rate is 37%
and drop-out rates range from 25-50% by faculty. Only 48% passed the



- 3 -
first-year exams in 1979. The major cause is the strong attitude prevailing
throughout the system that education is primarily concerned with passing
examinations, which renders curricula and the teaching methodologies
ineffective and creates an atmosphere which naither facilitates nor encourages
learning. This situation is compounded by tha low professional qualification
of teachers and inadequacy of basic learning naterials in the schools. The
four new faculties of sciences (para. 1.04) waose enrollments are projected at
20,000 by 1985, are expected to play an important role in upgrading the
quality of science and math instruction in upper-cycle secondary schools.
1.08     Equity.  Marked disparity in educational opportunity by sex and
region continues to exist. In the sparsely populated south and east of the
country, enrollment ratios are often less than 25% of the primary age group
with only 23% of the total representing girls as compared to the national
ratios of 72% and 37%. Apart from socio-cultural factors, low female
enrollments result from the shortages of school places (available places are
given first to boys), an inadequate number of women teachers (lack of proper
accommodation) and the siting of rural schools beyond the distance parents are
willing to send their daughters. Given the limitations imposed by distance,
availability of transport and construction capacity in these areas, provision
of educational facilities is difficult and expensive. The past lack of
relevance of the primary curriculum to the inamediate needs of rural
communities, especially as regards the education of girls, and the shortage of
qualified teachers, mainly attributed to inadequate housing, has not been
conducive to encouraging enrollments.
1.09     Relevance.  Primary education has a strong literary and rote learning
bias which persists in the secondary schools and universities. Thus, the two-
thirds of primary school leavers who do not enter secondary schools have
received an education which has scant relevance to life after school or the
need to find productive employment. The situation particularly affects the
quality of the output from the secondary schools as reflected by the low
efficiency in post-secondary programs. Reorientation of the curriculum and
teaching methodologies can have very little effect in schools which lack even
the most basic of primary educational aids such as dictionaries, blackboard
instruments, and maps. The situation has become more critical with the
introduction of a more practical curriculum, arabization of the medium of
instruction together with an effort to improve teacher training. In this
regard, the proposed curriculum for the senior secondary schools will require
more instructional hours for math and science and greater access to improved
equipment and laboratories.
1.10     Teacher Training.  Improvement of the quality of the teaching service
remains the outstanding issue affecting the achievement of the major
qualitative objectives of the Plan. The Government has provided the number of
teachers required to meet expansion needs (7,500 primary, 4,000 junior
secondary and 1,200 senior secondary teachers per year in 1980) by reducing
the training period for primary (two years to one year) and junior secondary
teachers (three years to two years) and by the recruitment of expatriates for
senior secondary schools, especially in sciences and math. The shortage of
trained Moroccan senior secondary teachers has seriously affected the quality
of the instruction being given in schools, particularly in math and science.
With the continued expansion of the system aad the phasing out by 1987 of
expatriate secondary teachers, the Government will be hard-pressed to meet the
requirements for secondary math/science teachers (Annex 3) needed to
(a) maintain the current balance of senior sacondary enrollments in the



- 4 -
science-oriented streams; (b) increase the hours of instruction in these
subjects; and (c) provide an upgraded program of study in math and science for
students in general streams. To ensure a high quality of instruction at this
level, an increasing number of university graduates with solid formal training
in the sciences must be made available to the teaching force via flexible,
high output one-year post-graduate programs.  However, the mdtjc-  ons-ra.n: is
the availability of high level teacher training staff to operate such
programs. Creation of a trained cadre of teacher trainers for this level of
instruction is still underway and it will be important to avoid dispersion of
this key resource by concentrating its impact on a core group of training
institutes providing pedagogical training to well qualified science and math
graduates (the future 'master" teachers and department heads), upgrading of
promising lower secondary teachers and training of general science teachers.
Consequently, it is unlikely that the overall requirements can be met during
the plan period because of limited resources for teacher training and, to some
extent because of insufficient numbers of candidates for training unless a
higher efficiency in university programs can be attained (para. 1.07). What
can be attained by drawing primarily upon well-qualified science and math
graduates, to be trained in a one-year pedagogical program, is a significant
increase in the overall percentage of qualified senior math/science teachers,
from 19% of the force at this level in 1981 to 84% by 1990.  In subsequent
plan periods, a major effort will be needed to increase the number of teacher
trainers (being initially trained under the proposed project) and to
disseminate the training programs to other training institutes.
Educationi Finance
1.11      Between 1975 and 1979, the real rate of increase of total
expenditures for the formal education system has kept pace with enrollment
growth.   This resulted in a substantial increase in the overall allocation to
education as a percentage of total public expenditures. By 1979, total
capital and recurrent public expenditures for education and training had
reached a high proportion of GDP, 6.5%, and 17.5% of total public
expenditure. A high 25% of total recurrent expenditures was being spent on
education and training in 1979, and an examination of the allocation of
present recurrent expenditures within the educational system shows the need
for economies in personnel costs.
1.12     Government plans for expansion of the school system to 1990 are
reasonable. Based on mission estimates of feasible enrollment increases by
1989/90, total annual average public education and training expenditures for
the period at constant 1979 prices could be on the order of US$1,639 million,
or DH6,330 million per annum. By 1990 this would constitute some 6.4% of GDP,
assuming that GDP grows at a reasonable average annual rate of 5.3% in the
period 1980-1990. Because this level of expenditures would maintain the
current share of education and training expenditures in GDP, provided that GDP
continues to grow at a reasonable rate, it is considered to be within the
Government's overall resource capability. It could pose an eventual financing
problem, however, if the rate of GDP growth were to decline significantly or
if the Government's claims on resources for other uses were to increase
disproportionately in the future. In any case, future developments which
might affect the Government's ability to support the projected level of
education and training expenditures are not expected to affect the proposed
project items. All the project items are fully provided for in the recently
adopted five-year budget law and the Government has specifically affirmed that
the Bank project items would not be affected by any possible future budgetary
revisions.



- 5-
Educational Policy and Strategy
1.13     The Government's educational prioril:ies in the current Plan are
consistent with its long-term goals, namely: (a) the expansion of primary
education to provide complete enrollment of l:he seven-year age group by 1995;
(b) arabization--the continued expansion of Arabic as the language of
instruction; (c) moroccanization of the teac't1ing service--this is complete at
the primary and junior secondary levels and it is planned to have the senior
secondary level fully Moroccan by 1987; and (d) the development of science and
math programs at secondary and higher education levels in line with a coherent
policy relative to science and technology, helping to meet more effectively
the country's needs for skilled manpower. lo address the immediate
constraints (para 1.05) affecting the achievement of these goals, the Plan
includes the following specific objectives:
(a)  more equitable provision of primary schools and improvement of
the quality of the instruction through the reorientation of the
curricula content and methodo'ogy and provision of basic
educational aids;
(b)  raising the standard of science and math teaching at the upper
secondary school level by increasing the proportion of highly
qualified Moroccan teachers aad by increasing the proportion of
time in the curriculum devotei to science and mathematics. The
strategy includes development of a highly qualified and
experienced team of Moroccan teacher trainers and the creation
of flexible, multi-purpose training institutes; and
(c) expansion of the country's vocational and technical training
capacity to provide training opportunities to school leavers and
meet the nation's trained manpower requirements at the middle
and lower level.
1.14     The Government's objectives are sound, in particular the focus on the
qualitative issues, i.e. on improvement of instruction and the general
efficiency of the school system, thereby ensuring that graduates have the
level of education required for further technical and professional training.
Bank Strategy and Lending for Education
1.15     Bank lending in the education sector (two credits and two loans) has
been consistent with the Government's objectives in addressing the major
problems of the education system. Bank involvement which began in 1963, has
concentrated on: (a) expansion and qualitative improvement of secondary
education as a basis for producing urgently needed trained manpower; (b) the
expansion and improvement of teacher training; (c) the expansion of manpower
training capacity in specific priority sectors, in particular agriculture
extension and technical education (technical secondary schools and institutes
of higher technology and engineering); and (d) support for more relevant and
equitably distributed rural education through the construction of primary
schools in the most deprived rural areas. The first credit (US$11.0 million)
in 1965 provided for the construction and equipping of 21 secondary schools



- 6 -
(three were later deleted) and was completed in June 1975 (PCR-Credit 78-MOR,
May 14, 1976; PPAR 1637, June 17, 1977). There were substantial delays in
implementation due to poor project management in the early stages.
Implementation was in the hands of part-time officials; weak decision-making
capability and cumbersome disbursement procedures also contributed to the
delays. The situation steadily improved following the creation of a separate,
permanently staffed project unit as specified in the second Credit Agreement.
1.16     The second credit (US$8.5 million) in 1971 provided strong support
for teacher training through the establishment of 7 teacher training
institutes and the qualitative improvement of science and technical teaching
through the provision of science laboratories for 6 general secondary schools,
and equipment for 10 technical and 13 commercial schools. Construction and
equipment were also provided in support of forestry training. The project was
completed in 1979 (PCR-Credit 266-MOR, June 1981) after being extended nearly
three years as a result of inadequate staffing of the Project Implementation
Unit (PIU), delays in the acquisition and technical evaluation of sites and
selection of qualified architects, and reduction of government budget
allocations (effects of the energy crisis) during the early implementation
stage. The third project (US$25.0 million) in 1976 continued support for
manpower training, secondary education and teacher training, provided 47
primary schools to increase educational opportunities and assisted in the
introduction of a more practical curriculum in primary schools. The
implementation of the education and training components of this project are
now proceeding satisfactorily (delays in the early stages were mainly
attributable to non-payment by the Government of architectural firms for
designs).
1.17     The fourth project (US$113.0 million) in 1979 will make a significant
contribution to the long-term requirements for technical manpower in Morocco
and an especially important contribution to the expansion of the higher
education system. When completed (1985), the project will have expanded the
enrollment capacity of Mohammedia Engineering College from 535 to 2,200, and
provided a College of Applied Engineering and two Higher Institutes of
Technology with an annual output of 750 higher level technicians. In
addition, the project includes the construction and equipping of 11 technical
secondary schools which will more than double current MOE capacity and a
technical teacher training institute which will play a major role in
supporting the expansion of technical education by providing 240 technical
teachers a year or 77% of estimated annual average needs. In spite of an
initial delay of 10 months, mainly the result of inadequate staffing and
organization of the PIU, the implementation of this project is proceeding
satisfactorily.
1.18     Bank experience in implementing the two completed projects, as well
as the two ongoing ones, has indicated the need to; (a) ensure as adequate and
complete a preparation of project components as possible prior to Board
presentation; (b) monitor the technical assistance components closely from the
very outset of the project implementation; (c) ensure that the PIU maintains
an adequate and qualified staff; and (d) review constantly progress in
processing of contract approvals and disbursement applications by the Ministry
of Finance (MOF) to forestall delays. Consistent with this, the proposed



- 7-
fifth project is at an advanced stage of preparation. The PIU is adequately
st:affed and is operating satisfactorily, and i:he Ministry of Finance has
recently adopted procedures to assure prompt payments and disbursements for
Bank project items.
1.19     The proposed fifth education project (US$50.0 million) would continue
the Bank's support for: (a) a more equitable provision of primary schools and
improvement of the quality of instruction (begun in the third education
project); and (b) assistance in improving the effectiveness of science
teaching (first education project) through the development of a competent
Moroccan teaching staff (second education project).
1.20     A possible follow-up project is likely to continue support for the
Government's efforts to expand and diversify its vocational and technical
training. Recent studies of the education and training sector will assist
both the Bank and the Government to determine priority areas for development
in terms of well-defined manpower requirement:s and priorities for possible
Bank financial assistance. The proposed prolect includes financing of
preinvestment studies and design work for components of a possible follow-up
project.
II.  THE PROJECT
Introduction
2.01     The proposed project was prepared by the Moroccan government, and
resulted in part from preinvestment studies financed under the fourth
education project. Bank preparation assistance missions visited Morocco in
November 1979 and January 1980. The project was appraised by Messrs. B. A.
Gagne (general educator, mission leader), M. Mahmoud (architect), C.
Germanacos (general educator, consultant) and J. C. Jones (technical educator,
consultant) and Ms. A. MacNamara (economist) during May 1980. The Government
presented a list of four prepared items for Bank appraisal; (a) 40 rural
primary schools, (b) 8 senior teachers' institutes, (c) a National Center for
Scientific and National Research, and (d) the construction and equipping of 4
middle-level technical training schools. During the course of the appraisal,
the Government also requested equipment (educational aids) for 700 primary
schools. (See Summary of Project Design and Preparation, Annex 2.) The
extended period since appraisal was partialLy caused by the discussion of
these project items with the Government and partly by country issues,
especially the Government's request to post-one negotiations until the Plan
was finalized and approved.
Objectives and Scope
2.02     The proposed project would assist the Government in implementing
priority programs fully consistent with its Five-Year National Development
Plan (1981-85). The project objectives are as follows;
(a) to continue support for the Government's policy for a more balanced
provision of primary education and meet more effectively the learning
needs of rural children, particularly girls;



(b)  to assist the Government in the provision of basic educational
materials to primary schools to improve teaching effectiveness; and
(c)  to improve the quality of science and math teaching at the senior
secondary level by training a competent Moroccan cadre of teacher
trainers, developing the required training programs and expanding the
capacity for teacher training.
2.03     The project is structured to address directly the major qualitative
constraints limiting the effective development of the educational system.  The
three components are linked by their common objective of improving primary and
secondary education, especially in math and science, thereby preparing
students for further skill and professional training to meet the country's
needs for middle and higher level manpower.  Thus, the project seeks to
increase access to primary education with special reference to disadvantaged
areas, and to provide the means (educational aids), improve the effectiveness
of teachers (primary), and ensure an adequate number of qualified science and
math teachers and department heads (secondary) to effectively implement the
revised curriculum. The number of primary schools to be constructed is
determined by the capacity of the Project Implementation Unit to supervise
construction in the remote areas designated for their location (para 2.06).
The number of schools where educational aids will be distributed is determined
by the rudimentary nature of the MOE's materials supply capability.
2.04     The project would comprise:  (a) constructing, furnishing and

Forty Primary Schools
2.05     The proposed construction and equipping of 40 rural primary schools
(grades 1-5) is a continuation of the program initiated as part of the third
education project which includes; (a) the introduction of a more relevant
curriculum focussing on simple manual skills and practical work including home
economics, health and child care for girls; (b) scheduling more teaching
periods for math and science; and (c) locatirg the schools in the more
deprived rural areas. The new curriculum was field-tested in 120 schools
(1979-80). The results were encouraging and demonstrated the interest and
resourcefulness in improvisation of school directors, teachers and local
education authorities when community participation and in-service training had
preceded the effort. Consequently, the Government has decided to extend the
program. A more comprehensive evaluation will be undertaken between 1982-85
and a report submitted to the Bank on the experience of the program under the
third education project. The Government is particularly anxious to generalize
the curriculum in urban as well as rural schools.
2.06     The proposed 40 schools would be located in 36 of the poorest
administrative districts which have the lowest age-group enrollment ratios.
Their location has been determined on the barsis of a school mapping exercise
which includes existing and planned local school facilities in relation to the
current and projected local school-age population. Sites for all of the
proposed schools have been acquired and allocated to the MOE for use under the
project. Although the remote areas selected for the schools pose certain
construction difficulties, the experience with construction in remote sites
under the third project establishes that the completion of the 40 primary
schools during the project period is within the construction capacity of these
areas.  The impact in terms of providing criteria for site selection,
facilities design and curricula adapted to thie needs of the local environment,
including the education of girls, offers solutions to many of the problems
constraining the equitable distribution (by region and sex) of educational
opportunities and is considered of much greater value by the Government and
the Bank than the number of places to be provided. Each school (200 pupils),
would offer a full primary education and serve as a focal point for rural and
community development. In addition to five classrooms, each school would have
a health room and a multi-purpose (workshop) room which would also be used
after school hours by the rural community for adult educational and health
activities. To ensure adequate staffing in the disadvantaged rural areas
where the schools would be located, housing at each school would be provided
for six staff members.
2.07     The workshop would be used by primary students for simple manual
skill training (boys) and home economics (girls). Tools and equipment and a
plot of land suitable for basic farming would also be provided. The
curriculum would include two hours a week fcr all pupils in the fourth and
fifth grades, for practical educational activities, divided about equally
between basic non-farm skills (metal and wocdwork for boys and home economics
for girls) and farm skills, and a substantial increase over the five grades in
the time allotments to math (about a 25% increase over the present curriculum)
and to science (about a 300% increase). Inservice training is already being
provided to teachers involved in the introduction of the program in their



- 10 -
respective schools.  Teams of trainers comprised of staff from the National
Pedagogical Institute and local school inspectors are giving three week
in-service courses to groups of 40 teachers (one male and one female teacher
from each of 20 primary schools) at local administrative centers. Selected
specialized staff have already been assigned to teacher training institutes
where the practical activities curriculum has become an integral part of the
teacher training program.
2.08     Twelve man/months of expert services of a curriculum specialist are
provided to complete counterpart staff training in the practical activities
program, to begin January 1, 1983. In addition, three fellowships of three
man/months each would be provided for visits to curriculum development and
textbook production centers abroad by the staff responsible for implementation
of the practical activities program to supplement their training. The names
of candidates and detailed arrangements for their fellowships would be
submitted to the Bank by January 1, 1983.
Basic Teaching/Learning Aids
2.09     To improve the quality of teaching and learning in the primary
schools, the project would provide a standard package of educational aids to
700 primary schools. The package consists of educational aids such as maps,
charts, dictionaries, blackboard instruments and a duplicator, normally
accepted as essential in primary education. The package of aids has been
prepared for an average school of 15 classes or about 600 pupils, at an
estimated cost of $5,400 per school. The project would be the first phase of
a government program to equip all primary schools with educational aids. The
schools which are to receive the equipment are mainly in towns or large
villages.  The schools were selected so as to have maximum impact (about 30%
of primary enrollments) while accommodating the introduction of the MOE's
proposed distribution system.
2.10     The project aims at providing the teachers with the basic educational
aids they require to apply concepts, instill learning skills and generally
provide the catalyst needed to make the revised primary curriculum more
meaningful and the teaching methodologies more effective and practical. The
MOE has provided to the Bank a list of the schools selected to be included in
the project. The system of distribution, control and storage to be used for
the equipment would be established by January 1, 1983 and a report on its
implementation submitted by the Government by January 1, 1986.
Senior Secondary Teacher Training Institutes
2.11     The construction and equipping of four proposed senior secondary
teacher training institutes (3,840 places) to be located at Casablanca, Fes,
Agadir and Marrakech would help meet government requirements for senior
secondary math and science teachers (Annex 3) and improve the quality of the
instruction being provided in science and math in the secondary schools. The
institutes would include three programs: (a) a one-year post-graduate program
of pedagogical training for math and science graduates of Moroccan
universities to produce master teachers and future heads of department; (b) a
four-year general science teacher degree program for science/math baccalaureat
holders; and (c) a two-year upgrading program for successful and experienced



- 11 -
junior secondary teachers to qualify them to :each as general science/math
teachers at the senior secondary level.  The estimated annual output from each
program would be 1,200, 450 and 200 respectively, for a total of 1,850 per
year (of which about one-third would be female). While the proposed
iTnstitutes do not meet the full demand for teachers, they represent the
maximum core program of teacher training which can be implemented with the
cadre of trainers available and under developnent. Given the flexible
character of the facilities, output can be readily increased, in particular
via the one-year post-graduate program. Inclusion of the three programs in
each institute would ensure the maximum utilization of the cadre of teacher
trainers which the project would continue to develop as well as of the
facilities and permit flexibility of intake according to the availability of
applicants (post-graduates and/or post-secondary). Included in the teacher
training institutes will be dormitory housing for all the student teachers, as
well as housing for key resident staff. The housing for student teachers is
considered an important inducement for the intensive training to be provided
in the institutes; operating costs of the dormitories will be entirely
self-financed through boarding fee payments made from the salaries received by
the student teachers.
2.12     Appropriate secondary science and math programs with adequate
provision for practical work have been prepared but can be effected only when
qualified teachers are available. The institutes would offer options in
natural sciences, chemistry, physics and matt., with specific provision for a
pedagogical training component. The equipmernt list required for the programs
has been prepared by a committee specifically appointed in the MOE for the
task and has been submitted to the Bank for review and comment.
2.13     Achievement of the qualitative objectives of this component depends
on the development of a highly qualified and experienced Moroccan teacher
training staff (50 per institute) and effective teacher training programs of a
standard acceptable to the Bank. Technical assistance (212 man/months of
experts and 360 man/months of fellowships--see Annex 1, Schedule 1, Page 4) is
included in the project to supplement, in specialized pedagogical fields, the
post-graduate program designed by the University Faculty of Education, Rabat,
to prepare staff to teach in the institutes and to develop training programs.
Experts will be engaged by January 1, 1983 to help prepare the training
programs and to assist in the training of future Moroccan teacher trainers.
.To assure the successful completion of these tasks, the Directorate of
Technical Education in the MOE has developed an exchange program with Canadian
universities for expert services and training. A detailed description of the
training programs would be submitted to the 3ank for review and comment by
September 1, 1984.  The profiles, terms of reference and recruitment schedules
of the experts required to develop the teacher training programs of the
teacher training institutes will be submitted for Bank review. The 26
fellowships (360 man/months) are to be providled for experienced and successful
secondary teachers for post-graduate studies to be undertaken in specialized
pedagogical fields specifically related to the needs of the institutes and not
available within Morocco. Names of candidates and detailed arrangements for
itheir fellowships would be submitted to the 3ank by January 1, 1983. The job
descriptions for the future teacher training staff will be approved by the
Bank and the staff recruited by January 1, 1383.

Technical Assistance (TA)
2.14     To ensure the success of the teacher training component of the
project and attainment of its qualitative objectives, related technical
assistance (TA), 212 man/months of experts and 360 man/months of fellowships
has been included for staff and program development (para 2.13). In addition,
the proposed project includes TA for the PIU and the completion of actions
related to the primary practical activities curriculum. To ensure the PIU'S
capacity to manage the proposed project, in addition to the ongoing third and
fourth education projects, 24 man-months of TA will be provided to extend the
contract of a senior architect from July 1,1985 and 36 man-months for the
services of engineers or consultants to strengthen the procurement capability
of the PIU who would be recruited by January 1, 1983. Also short training
courses and short term fellowships would be provided to selected PIU staff.
To complete the training of the Moroccan staff responsible for the primary
curriculum, 12 man-months of expert services and 9 man-months of fellowships
are being provided. To ensure that future projects are carried to an advanced
stage of preparation (final tender documents for civil works and equipment and
negotiated agreements for specialist services), the project makes provision
for financing special studies, and architectural and other consultant fees for
an estimated US$2.8 million (net of contingencies). All study proposals,
principals, terms of reference and calendars of implementation would be
submitted to the Bank for comment and approval.

3.03     Basis of Cost Estimates.  Costs exclude any identifiable taxes, and
educational materials and equipment in Morocco are exempt from import duties.
Civil works costs for the proposed project are estimated on the basis of unit
prices derived from current contracts and detailed estimates of other projects
of similar character, and were adjusted for regional cost differences. These
unit prices compare favorably to current MOE prices and Bank norms. Furniture
and equipment costs are based on current CIF unit prices and adjusted upward
to include local transportation and installation. Costs of the TA component
are based on prevailing international costs of specialists and of fellowships;
(a) average cost per man-month of about US$8,650 for experts, and (b) of
US$2,290 for fellowships, for which 80% would be foreign exchange cost.
Baseline cost estimates have been adjusted to reflect prices at the time of
negotiations.



- 15 -
3.04     Contingency Allowance.  The project cost includes a contingency
allowance for unforeseen physical conditions equal to 10% of the estimated
cost of civil works, professional services, and furniture and equipment, and
5% of the estimated cost of TA. It also includes price escalation
contingencies calculated for the period beginning at negotiations and in
accordance with an appropriate schedule of implementation (Annex l, Schedule
1). In view of the differences in the prevai:Ling rates of price escalation
for local and international market prices, escalation contingencies were
estimated separately for local and foreign costs. For foreign costs, price
escalation is calculated on the basis of annual international price increases
in USt of 8.0% for 1982 and 1983, 7.5% for 1934, 7.0% for 1985 and 6.0% for
1986 and 1987. Domestic cost increases are estimated as 8.0% from 1982
through 1987 (Annex 1, Table 3). Prices are expected to increase during the
project implementation period by a weighted total of 26.1% for civil works,
28.7% for professional services, 38.1% for furniture, 38.7% for equipment, and
30.9% for TA. Accordingly, aggregated price increases are estimated at 28.8%
of baseline costs plus physical contingencies. Total contingencies are
estimated to be about 41.1% of baseline costs.
3.05     Foreign Exchange Component.  The estimated foreign exchange component
is US$50.0 million equivalent or 52.9% of the total project cost. The
calculation of the foreign exchange component is based on the assumption that;
(a) all civil works and almost all professional services will be awarded to
local or mixed (Moroccan/foreign) firms; (b) all equipment will be directly
imported; and (c) about 70% of the furniture will be awarded to foreign
suppliers. The resulting foreign exchange content of each category of
expenditure is as follows; (i) civil works, 42%; (ii) furniture, 73%;
(iii) equipment, 90%; (iv) consultant architects' fees, 18%; and (v) technical
assistance, 80%.

Project Financing
3.06     The proposed loan of US$50.0 million would finance 100% of the total
estimated foreign exchange cost of the project. The Government would finance
the balance of the total project costs. The proposed financing plan is

Recurrent Costs
3.07     When fully operational in 1988, the project institutions are
estimated to generate DH 99 million in additional annual recurrent costs,
constituting about 1.2 percent of projected public recurrent education
expenditures. This modest increase in recurrent costs is reasonable, and is
not considered likely to constitute a recurrent cost burden when the project
institutions are operational. Moreover, the projected overall level of
recurrent costs of education is considered reasonable and sustainable,
provided that GDP continues to grow at a reasonable rate. In that situation,
recurrent costs for all Ministry of Education facilities are projected to
decline from 25.9 percent of total government recurrent costs in 1981 to 22.2
percent in 1985. Recurrent costs of education could pose an eventual
financing problem, however, if the rate of GDP growth were to decline
significantly or if the Government's claim on resources for other uses were to
increase disproportionately in the future. In any case, future developments



- 17 -
which might affect the Government's ability to support the projected level of
education and training expenditures are not expected to affect the proposed
project items. All the project items are fully provided for in the recently
adopted five-year budget law and the Government has specifically affirmed that
the Bank project items would not be affected by any possible future budgetary
revisions.
Implementation
3.08     Administration.  The PIU in the MOE, which currently manages the
execution of the third and fourth education projects, will be responsible for
the overall implementation of the fifth project. Because of the additional
workload, the PIU has been strengthened by the appointment of three
architect/engineers, by assistance in supervision by the local education
authorities in rural areas, and by the provision of necessary equipment for
offices and transportation. Consequently, the Bank is satisfied that the PIU
is adequately staffed to implement the proposed project. To ensure continuity
and strengthen the procurement capacity of the PIU over the project period,
the project provides funds for five man/years of TA which will extend the
senior architect's contract into 1987 and provide qualified engineers or
consultants to strengthen procurement services (para 2.14). The Government
has provided assurances that other staff of the PIU will be maintained at the
current level for the duration of the project. The Director of Teacher
Training in the MOE will be directly responsible for the implementation of the
technical assistance component related to the staff and program development in
the teacher training institutes.
3.09     The construction, furnishing and equipping of all schools is sche-
duled to be completed by October 1986, and *:he TA component would be completed
by September 1987 (Annex 1, Schedule 1). Tais schedule is considered to be
reasonable and within the capability of the Government and contractors. To
allow sufficient time for submission of the final withdrawal applications, the
Closing Date would be March 31, 1988.  Given the project's advanced stage of
preparation, the disbursement period (six years) is estimated to be 1-1/2
years shorter than the current average for Bank education projects in the
EMENA region.
3.10     Critical Activities.  The critical, activities in project
implementation and the expected completion dates are indicated in the
following table.  Such dates are achievable with the proposed project
management arrangements, and would serve as a basis for project implementation
monitoring.

3.11     Civil Works.  Consultant architects financed by the proceeds of the
fourth education project have developed preliminary designs of all the items
in the fifth project and the Bank has reviewed and approved these designs.
The final construction drawings and bid documents for the 4 senior secondary
teacher training institutes and 20 primary schools out of 40 schools are ready
for international competitive bidding. The bid documents for the remaining 20
primary schools will be ready by November 1982.
3.12     Sites.  The Government has selected sites for all project
institutions (40 rural primary schools, 4 senior secondary teacher training
institutes) according to norms agreeable to t:he Bank.  The majority of sites
hwave public utilities (water, electricity, anid sewerage) readily available.
The cost of land acquisition would be borne by the Government and is not
included in the project.  However, the Government's assurance, satisfactory to
the Bank, that all sites have been acquired and allocated to the Ministry of
Education for construction has been given to the Bank at negotiations.
3.13     Equipment Lists.  The lists prepared by consultants for the primary
schools of the third project will be used for the proposed 40 primary
schools. The lists of equipment required for the 700 primary schools
qualifying for assistance under the project are prepared and an understanding
was reached during negotiations that the Government will use the services of
an international agency for the procurement Df this equipment. The detailed
Lists for the equipment for the senior secondary teacher training institutes
were reviewed during negotiations and draft tender documents would be
submitted to the Bank by March 31, 1983.
3.14     Procurement.  Forty primary schools which are of small size
(estimated average contract size US$0.50 million per school) and are to be
located in rural areas, would be grouped according to locations and would be
awarded according to international competitive bidding. Civil works contracts
for the senior secondary teacher training institutes (estimated at US$44.1
million) which are located in readily accessible sites, would be awarded
through international competitive bidding.
3.15     Detailed lists and specifications of furniture and equipment would be
presented to the Bank for review and approval prior to procurement. Furniture
and equipment items (amounting to US$18.0 million including contingencies)
would be grouped, to the extent possible, in large packages to permit bulk
procurement. Contracts for furniture and equipment in excess of US$200,000
would be awarded in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for ICB. Small
items or groups of items, estimated to cost less than the above figure or
items of specialized nature, for which ICB vould not be practical and items
which must be compatible with other equipmernt procured under ICB, would be
procured under normal government procedures satisfactory to the Bank and would
include to the extent possible, quotations from at least three manufacturers
or suppliers; the total value of furniture and equipment so procured would not
exceed an aggregate total of US$1.5 million or about 8.3% of estimated
equipment and furniture costs including contingency allowances. For the
purpose of comparing foreign and local bids under ICB, local manufacturers of
furniture and equipment would be allowed a margin of preference equal to the
existing rate of customs duties applicable to competing imports or 15% of the
CIF price, whichever is lower. Draft tender and contract documents for
furniture and equipment would be forwarded, on completion, for Bank review and
approval; Bank approval of tender evaluation documents would be required prior



- 20 -
to the award of all contracts for furniture and equipment under ICB and for
all civil works contracts. Bank reimbursement of all other contracts would be
contingent upon Bank approval of tender evaluation documents subsequent to
contract awards.
Disbursements
3.16     Disbursements (Annex 1, Schedule 2) would be fully documented and
would be made on the basis of;
(a)  civil works (US$24.7 million);                42% of total expenditures
(b) furniture and equipment (US$14.4 million):
(i) directly imported                       100% of foreign
expenditures
(ii) locally manufactured                    100% of ex-factory cost
(iii) locally procured (off-the-shelf)        85% of local expenditures
(c)  professional services (US$0.5 million):    18% of total expenditures
(d) technical assistance:
(i) consultants (US$2.7 million)            80% of total expenditures
(ii) fellowships (US$0.9 million)            100% of foreign
expenditures
(iii) preinvestment studies
(US$2.9 million)                       80% of total expenditures
US$3.2 million would be earmarked for unallocated.
Accounts and Auditing
3.17     The PIU has recently introduced a more efficient accounting system
and increased its accounting staff. The PIU can now produce on demand updated
accounts and relevant statements pertaining to different categories of project
expenditures. The Authorization Department of the MOF is responsible for
controlling all PIU financial commitments through approval of contracts and
allocation and transfer of funds. The Capital Investment Division (Division
du Budget d'Equipement) of the MOF processes applications for Bank
disbursements. The Moroccan Government has a central auditing department
(L'Inspection Generale des Finances) which audits all government accounts and
prepares an annual report. So far, the PIU has had no independent annual
audit of its accounts. During negotiations, the Government provided
assurances that; (a) the PIU's accounts and financial statements for each
fiscal year will be audited in accordance with appropriate auditing principles
consistently applied, by auditors from the Government's central auditing
department; and (b) henceforth, the Government will furnish to the Bank, as
soon as available, but in any case not later than six months after the end of
each fiscal year, certified copies of the project's financial statements and
audit report.

IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
4.01     The main benefits expected to accrue from the implementation of the
proposed project are as follows;
(a)  improvement of access to and quality of primary education through an
addition to the number of places available to primary school-age
children, especially girls, in the nore disadvantaged rural areas of
the country in schools better adapted to the new primary curriculum
and to community development use;
(b)  the provision of basic educational materials for primary schools to
improve the quality of learning and. effectiveness of teaching;
(c)  the establishment of increased capacity to train Moroccan senior
secondary teachers in the critical subject areas of science and math,
thereby supporting the expansion and qualitative improvement of the
science/math option in the senior ;econdary schools. This will
enhance the development of higher 'Level scientific and technological
manpower and the creation of a spe,ialist cadre of Moroccan secondary
teacher trainers.
Risks
4.02     Experience with previous projects has shown that variations over time
in PIU staffing have contributed to delays in project execution. The PIU,
currently managing the implementation of the third and fourth education
projects, has been provided with an adequate staff of architects, engineers,
and accountants. To ensure its capacity tc assume the execution of the fifth
project, provision has been made for a qualified procurement officer or
consultants to be added to the staff.  It is imperative that the PIU's staff
strength be monitored closely by the Bank through semestrial reports and
supervision missions.
4.03     Development of appropriate curricula and inservice training programs
for the senior secondary teacher training Lnstitutes is an essential condition
for the success of the project. Thus, teclnical assistance for curriculum
development and instructor training must be scrupulously supervised from the
outset of the project.

- 23 -
5.03     As a condition for Board Presentation, the Government has submitted
to the Bank for review the final construction drawings and bid documents for
the four teacher training institutes and 20 primary schools. Site plans for
the remaining 20 schools have been reviewed by the Bank; an understanding was
reached that final construction drawings and b:-d documents for these schools
will be completed by November 30, 1982 (para. 3.11). An understanding was
also reached that the Government will use the services of an international
agency for the procurement of the instructionaL materials for the 700 primary
schools (para. 3.13).
5.04     Subject to the above assurances, the project provides a suitable
basis for a Bank loan of US$50.0 million to the Kingdom of Morocco for a term
of 17 years, including a grace period of 4 years.

FIFTH EDUCATION PROJECT
Summary of Project Design and Preparation
1.       The fifth education project as origi nally identified (Project Brief
dated February 8, 1979) proposed the construction and equipping of 4
institutes of applied technology (ITAs), 20 vocational centers, 40 basic skill
training centers and the provision of 15 mobile training units.  Lack of funds
in the Ministry of Labour, resulting from severe macro-economic difficulties
in Morocco at the time, reduced the technicaL/vocational component to 4 ITAs.
To take advantage of available Bank financing, the Government requested that
the project include priority items previously presented by the Ministry of
Education and for which preinvestment finance was included in the fourth
education project. These items were:  40 rural primary schools, 8 senior
secondary teacher training institutes and the national center for coordinating
research (Project Brief Update dated November 16, 1979).
2.       Bank preparation assistance was provided by a technical educator,
consultant in November 1979 and January 1980 (Back-to-Office Report dated
January 22, 1980).
3.       A Bank appraisal mission consisting of Messrs. B. A. Gagne (general
educator, mission leader), M. Mahmoud (architect), C. Germanacos (general
educator, consultant) and J. C. Jones (technical educator, consultant) and Ms.
A. MacNamara (economist) visited Morocco from May 5-29, 1980. A summary of
the mission's findings was distributed on June 9 (Issues Paper) for the
Decision Meeting which took place on June 24, 1980. The Decision Memorandum,
dated July 3, 1980, confirmed the mission's recommendations that: (a) the
advanced stage of construction of the proposed 4 ITAs precluded Bank financing
of these items in the fifth project; (b) thE; project include the construction
and equipping of 40 primary schools, the national research center, 4 rather
than 8 senior secondary teacher training institutes and a package of
educational aids for 700 primary schools which was requested by the Government
during appraisal; and (c) the negotiations cf the fifth education project
(originally scheduled for September 1980) bE postponed (Government's request)
to permit additional preparation of project components and effect measures to
improve the capacity and effectiveness of the Project Implementation Unit in
implementing the ongoing third and fourth education projects (no disbursement
applications had been submitted for either project).
4.        Post-appraisal missions visited Morocco in October 1980, and February
and May 1981. The supervision reports of March 19, 1981 and July 20, 1981
indicate the progress achieved in the strengthening and reorganization of the
Project Implementation Unit and the consequent improved implementation of the
education components of the third and fourth education projects. The delay in
reaching final agreement with the Governmen: on the project composition

concerned primarily issues associated with the construction of four rather
than eight senior secondary teacher training institutes. Following detailed
studies of the sector areas specifically relevant to the proposal, the Bank
mission summarized its justification in a memorandum dated January 16, 1981,
and Back-to-Office Report dated March 18, 1981. The translated version of the
Memorandum served as a base for an extensive dialogue with the Government
which culminated in agreement on the construction of four institutes in May
1981.
5.       During this period (May 1980 to January 1981), the Government
requested that the equipment for the computer and satellite reception
laboratories for the National Research Center be added to the original
proposal and that the Bank consider financing the first phase of the
Government's plan to furnish all primary schools with a package of basic
educational aids (Back-to-Office Report dated March 18, 1980). These
proposals necessitated further justification and preparation. In the case of
the first item, it was considered that insufficient progress had been made in
preparing the program of the center and in defining the equipment
specifications. Consequently, the item was excluded from the project at the
review stage.
6.       The components of the proposed fifth education project are consistent
with the priorities outlined in the Government's Five-Year National
Development Plan (1981-85) and relevant to the key areas of concern currently
being reviewed by the National Commission for Educational Reform.
