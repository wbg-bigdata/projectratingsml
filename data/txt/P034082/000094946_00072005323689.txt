contribution rate to more than 55 percent, or reducing the replacement ratio from around 60
percent to less than 35 percent. This would cause great distortions in the labor market and/or
great dissatisfaction and unrest among future pensioners.
With the transition, the PAYG system was subject to strong pressures caused by a significant loss
of revenues and a steep increase in the system dependency ratio. The loss of revenues amounted
to almost 3 percent of GDP between 1991 and 1997, and the revenue problems were to a good
extent due to an erosion of the tax base. The erosion in the base is clear from the decline in the
ratio of the covered wage bill to the wage bill and in the ratio of the wage bill to labor income.
Such base erosion was due not only to problems of ceilings and exemptions, but also to increasing
efforts to evade the heavy payroll tax. A reduction in the overall labor share due to a period wage
compression also contributed to the decline in the base and revenues relative to GDP.
The fast increase in the system dependency ratio during the 1990s was not due to adverse
demographics, but primarily to a fast increase in the number of pensioners during the early stages
of the transition, due to lax early retirement and disability rules. The increase in the number of
pensioners implied strong pressures on expenditures and, combined with the revenue loss, would
have resulted in very large PAYG deficits, in the absence of other correcting measures. The main
correction that took place involved the manipulation of indexation parameters in the benefit
formula, and which resulted in a significant drop of the average replacement ratio. The sharp real
wage compression that took place in the mid-1990s (around 15 percent in 1995 and 1996) also
contributed to the decline in real pensions, given the wage indexation of pensions. The combined
outcome of these measures was a drop in pension expenditures relative to GDP, and only modest

PAYG deficits in the early and mid-1990s.
Although these corrections did prevent the emergence of very large deficits in the PAYG system,
they were perceived as ad hoc, arbitrary, and unfair, diminishing the credibility of the PAYG in
the eyes of the population. Furthermore, the scope for additional ad hoc corrections had
narrowed severely given the overall fiscal situation, making the system even more vulnerable to
the demographic shocks projected for the 21st century.

In the absence of reforms, under reasonable assumptions (see table 3 in section 6), the Hungarian
pension system would have continued to generate growing deficits. The deficits would grow to
around 2 percent of GDP at the end of the first decade of the century, and would converge to
around 6.5 percent of GDP in 2070. The result is essentially due to the assumption of a declining
rate of inflation and to adverse demographic trends. The decline in the rate of inflation implies
increasing real average pension benefits and replacement ratios, because of the full backward
wage indexation rule (prevailing before the reforms), and also because of increasing real wage
benefits due to smaller inflation-related losses built into the former benefit formula. Whereas the
decline in inflation is the major cause of the early deficits, demographic factors dominate the
results after the first decade. The projected fluctuations in the deficit closely mirror the old age
and system dependency ratios. Both ratios increase between 1995 and 2017, followed by a ten
year period of stability, followed by another increase. The old age dependency ratio nearly
doubles to 65 percent at the end of the projection period, while the system dependency ratio
grows to 120 percent.
The main objectives of the reform were the following. The reforn gave workers the choice to
stay in a reformed PAYG system or to switch to a new, mixed pension system until end-August
1999. However, guarantees within the new second pillar were provided only to workers who
participated in this new pillar for at least 15 years, which limited severely the attractiveness of the
new system for workers older than 47 years of age . The government's information campaign also
strongly advised older workers not to switch to the new scheme. Workers who initially opted for
the new system will be able to return to the reformed PAYG until December 2000. After that
date, workers will be permanently affiliated either with the reformed PAYG or with the new
system. New entrants in the labor force after July 1998 were automatically enrolled in the new
mixed system.
The reformed PAYG included a higher normal retirement age of 62 for both men and women,
changes in the benefit formula designed to gradually eliminate some of the redistributive elements
in the formula, a new tax regime and a shift from backwards net wage indexation to a indexation
formula consisting of a combination of contemporaneous price and wage indexation (50 percent
net wages, 50 percent consumer prices). The new legislation included detailed transition tables
for the retirement age increase and corresponding early retirement penalties and a new set of
accrual rates which apply to gross rather than net wage history. The retirement age started rising
immediately but only reaches its new final state in the year 2009. The new legislation also
included a transition period for the new indexation formula, specifying the maintenance of full
backward wage indexation for 1998 and 1999, followed by a mixed 70-30 percent (wage-prices)
contemporaneous indexation fornula for 2000, and finally a contemporaneous 50-50 formula for
2001 and subsequent years. The new benefit formula and tax regime will become effective by
2013.
Many of the changes reflected the government's position that redistribution should be removed
from the pension scheme. This was based on the government's desire to tighten the link between
contributions and benefits in order to improve compliance and the insurance characteristics in the
system. An element of intra-generational redistribution was maintained, but in the form of a
- 4 -



minimum top-up, means-tested pension benefit financed outside the pension system. The final
outcome in terms of intra-generational redistribution and fiscal impact of shifting redistribution
out of the public pension scheme will depend on various factors, such as how pensions are
actually taxed in the future, the contribution structure and the extent to which social assistance
replaces the current redistribution.
For workers deciding to stay in the PAYG a contribution rate of 30 percent (expected to be
reduced by 2-3 percentage points, in line with the reforms in the PAYG) would be paid by the
worker and his/her employee, and the average income worker could expect to obtain a
replacement ratio of around 60 percent of the net average wage (equivalent to an annual accrual
rate of 1.5 percent). Workers staying in the reformed PAYG could also obtain additional
coverage from the voluntary, third pillar, which has been in existence since 1993, encouraged by
generous tax incentives.
The essential difference between the new mixed pension system and the reformed PAYG scheme
is that the former includes a mandatory second pillar which replaces a portion of the PAYG
scheme. Workers who decide to stay in the reformed PAYG will continue having 30 percent of
their gross wages channeled to the PAYG. Under the original 1997 legislation, workers who
switched to the new system would have 22 percent of their gross wages channeled to the first
(PAYG) pillar and 8 percent channeled to their second pillar accounts. This contribution rate
structure would follow a two year transitional period-the contribution to the second pillar would
be 6 percent in 1998, 7 percent in 1999 and 8 percent from 2000 onward. The overall
contribution rate would remain at 30 percent and the contribution to the first pillar would be
reduced accordingly.
The first pillar of the new multipillar system applies the same rules as the reformed PAYG,
including higher retirement age and minimum years of service and indexation arrangements. The
benefit formula was scaled down in proportion with the size of the contribution rates. Therefore,
the annual accrual rate in the new first pillar was reduced to 1.22 percent, or roughly 74 percent
of the 1.65 accrual rate which applies for those workers who remain in the reformed PAYG
scheme. This corresponds to the ratio of the contribution rate to the PAYG paid by workers who
switch to the multipillar scheme to the contribution rate paid by workers who do not switch,
namely 22/30. For those who switch to the new scheme, the 1.22 accrual rate applies for both
past and future years of participation in the system, implying that anyone who switches is
effectively forfeiting approximately one quarter of their acquired rights in the process.
The mandatory contributions to the second pillar are being placed in pension funds which are, like
the existing third pillar, mutual benefit funds managed exclusively by their members. Individuals
switching to the new system are guaranteed a minimum second pillar benefit equal to 25 percent
of the value of the first pillar pension. This guarantee is equivalent to around 93 percent of the
pension which would have been received if the worker had remained in the pure PAYG scheme,
and applies to workers with at least 15 years of participation in the new system. The guarantee is
modest for new workers, being equivalent to a minimum lifetime real return of only 0 percent for
these workers. However, the guarantee is equivalent to a minimum real return of more than 4.5
percent for workers in their mid-forties, due to the short accumulation period. Therefore, the
- 5 -



guarantee could be triggered for workers in their mid-forties who switch to the new scheme,
although the amount required to meet this guarantee should not be significant.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The new government (following the general elections of May 1998) proceeded with the
implementation of the reform which had started in January 1998 but introduced a number of
changes. The main one was a decision, enacted by the new Parliament as an amendment to the
original law, to maintain the contribution rate to the second pillar at 6 percent in 1999, instead of
increasing it to 7 and 8 percent, as originally planned. In order to decrease the burden on
employers, the government decreased the contribution rate for pensions and health care in 1998
by 6 percent, including 2 for pensions and 4 percent for health care. However, at the same time,
the worker's contribution rate for pensions increased from 6 percent in 1997 to 8 percent in 1999
so that the decline of the combined contribution rate for pensions was zero. Another important
measure involved changes in the indexation rules for the transition period negotiated during the
reform preparation: instead of maintaining the backward wage indexation in 1999 (which would
have resulted in nominal pension increases of 18 percent), the government announced an ad hoc
increase of 14 percent. The announcement of these changes created a degree of uncertainty
among workers and market participants, especially as they were not accompanied by an
announcement of the policies that would be followed in 2000 and future years. Some statements
by members of the new government raised the level of uncertainty further, as they announced an
intention to introduce more fundamental changes, and even to roll back the reform entirely.
Several persons filed suits in the Constitutional Court claiming that the government had violated
their acquired rights by modifying the legislation. The suit with respect to the 14% pension
increase was rejected, while that concerning the contribution rate to the second pillar is still
pending.
The major concern that drove the changes were related to the deficits caused by the loss of
revenues to the second pillar. The Ministry of Finance indicated that fiscal policy was guided by a
desire to reduce the overall level of the public sector deficit and converge toward the Maastricht
Treaty deficit target of 3 percent of GDP. It was also felt that the previous government had
underestimated. the fiscal impact of the reforms by underestimating the number of workers that
would switch to the new system. (The actual numbers were much larger, which added to the
concerns about the fiscal impact). During the preparation of the 1999 budget in the summer of
1998, two factors led officials to take precautionary budgetary measures. These measures
included blocking in March (rather than spending, e.g. on flood relief) the budget reserve that had
been set aside, and adopting the 14 percent rather than the originally negotiated 18 percent
increase for pensions. The two factors were, first, the fact that inflation was declining much faster
than anticipated implying a higher cost of servicing the public debt and, second, the Russian
fmancial crisis (which was unfolding at that time) which had an impact on Hungarian economy
that was impossible to predict. Although it was known that the impact of the increase in the
contribution rate on the fiscal deficit would be small, and that this deficit was in any case neutral
from the point of view of inflation, external accounts and macroeconomic stability (because of the
offsetting higher private savings), policy-makers preferred to err on the side of budgetary
prudence.
By the second half of 1999, public finance and macroeconomic stability concerns had subsided
- 6 -



and the reform as measured by the number of switchers had shown to be a great success. Against
this background, the new government both endorsed the reform and indicated its intention to raise
the contribution rate to the second pillar to 8 percent without, however, indicating a firm time
frame.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
This section discusses the extent to which the objectives were achieved. The key elements of the
switching strategy adopted by the government were (1) to make the reform mandatory for new
entrants (after July 1998) and voluntary for anyone with a contribution history in the old system,
and (2) to recognize accrued rights by making compensatory pension payments at the time of
retirement.
The rights earned under the old scheme would be recognized by applying the accrual rates of the
new first pillar. Since these accrual rates are lower than those implied by the old formula,
workers switching would voluntarily forego part of their accrued rights. The new system would
still prove attractive to younger workers, because the higher returns in the second pillar result in
higher pensions in the new system under reasonable assumptions. Therefore, the valuation of past
contributions in the context of a voluntary switch allowed the government a certain measure of
control over the speed of the transition and the size of early transition deficits, as well as a
reduction in the implicit pension debt.

original reform package, and under reasonable assumptions on returns and costs (returns of 2
percent above wage growth, annuity rate equal to wage growth, and operating costs and charges
amounting to 15 percent of contributions), workers below 36 years of age would tend to switch
to the new system (where the overall replacement ratio is higher), whereas workers above that
age would find attractive to stay in the reformed PAYG. Of course, these are rather conservative
assumptions about pension fund returns. As shown in Figure 4, the return-wage growth
differential in the 1980s and 1990s was higher than 2 percent in a sample of countries with large
funded systems, even in countries that imposed portfolio restrictions and/or followed very
conservative portfolio strategies such as Denmark and Switzerland. For the sake of illustration,
assuming returns of 3 percent above wage growth, and under the same assumptions, the
equilibrium cut-off age would increase to 38 years of age, as shown in Figure 5. Of course, if
returns were assumed to be as high are those shown in Figure 4, the cut-off age would even
exceed 40 years of age.

During the reform implementation, there was an effort to maintain discipline in the switching
process and avoid overselling by private sales agents, ensuring that switchers consisted primarily
of younger workers. To this end, the government prepared a public relations campaign informing
workers about the main parameters and objectives of the reform, made the switching model
available in the internet, and maintained
a nurnber of information centers in the major cities, where workers could obtain free information
and advice. Finally, the government also withdrew the second pillar guarantee for workers who
have less than 180 months of contributions.
The actual switching outcome was in line with switching experiences in other countries and
exceeded initial expectations. As shown in Figures 6 and 7, the number of switchers was
significant in the

million workers or half of the labor force. More than 85 percent of switchers consisted of
workers below 40 years of age, and more than 80 percent of workers in their 20s and early 30s
switched to the new system.
The new Government's ambiguous attitude towards the reform and its reluctance to increase the
contribution rate to 8 percent did not seem to stop the flow of workers switching to the new
system, as shown in Figure 6. There may a number of explanations of why workers continued
switching, despite the uncertainty caused by the absence of full political support to the reform.
- 1 0 -



For one, the possibility to switch back to the reformed PAYG by the end of 2000 may have
eliminated the perception of risk associated with early switching. Also, some workers may have
speculated that the originally envisaged contribution rate of 8 percent would sooner or later be
restored. Indeed, if the contribution rate were increased to 8 percent in 2002 by the same
Government or a new coalition Government (after the 2002 elections), the equilibrium cut-off age
would be only slightly reduced, as shown in Figures 3 and 5.
Finally, workers switching to the new system may have assigned a great weight to the political
risk associated with the PAYG. The perception of significant political risk associated with the
public PAYG is justified, in view of the manipulation of the parameters of the Hungarian PAYG
benefit formula in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The decision of the new Government to
abandon the indexation formula negotiated and agreed for the period of transition, and established
in the 1997 law, provides another example of how the parameters of a public PAYG system may
be easily changed by subsequent legal amendments.
The failure to restore the original 8 percent contribution in the next few years could lead to a
significant reduction in the equilibrium cut-off age. As shown in Figures 3 and 5, maintaining the
contribution to the second pillar at 6 percent indefinitely would reduce the cut-off age to around
28-33 years of age, depending on the assumption for pension fund returns in the long-run. It is
difficult to assess when the contribution rate to the second pillar will be increased to 8 percent
(see para. 26). However, it is clear that there are a few cohorts that might be better-off switching
back to the reformed PAYG, if the original contribution rate is not restored.
4.2 Outputs by components:
1. Reform of the PAYG System
The main reform measures were the increase in the retirement age and the change in the
indexation of pensions. Other measures such as the changes in the benefit formula and the tax
treatment are also important for individual workers but they have little or no impact on the
aggregate balance of the PAYG. The impact of the measures are discussed in section 6. The
reform of the PAYG has been fully satisfactory.
2. Disability Pensions
In the area of disability pensions, the reform has been totally unsatisfactory. None of the measures
envisaged in the Letter of Development Policy regarding disability pensions were implemented.
The current government has no concrete plans to modify current arrangements for disability. The
only significant change that has taken place in recent years on that front is the Law. on Equal
Opportunity for the Disabled. Based on this law, a decree is being prepared which will provide
new subsidies for the disabled to compensate for some of the hardships which they face. There is
a possibility that the classification system might be modified but, at the earliest, this would not be
before July 2001. The number of persons below the retirement age classified as disabled has
continue to grow at an alarming rate, increasing from 352,000 in 1996 to 424,400 in 1999.
Moreover the rate of increase in the number of persons below retirement age receiving a disability
pension has, if anything, increased since the early 1990s. Each year the ranks of the under-age
disabled pensioners increases by 10 to 13 percent.
- 11 -



In the current system, according to the 82/1997 Act on Private Pension Funds, a worker who is a
member of a pension fund and becomes disabled becomes eligible for a Pension Fund (PAYG)
financed disability pension. In other words, workers who are enrolled in the second pillar and are
declared disabled have a choice between continuing their participation in the multi-pillar system or
switching back to the PAYG. She might opt for staying in the multi-pillar system if her inability to
work although severe, so that she is entitled for disability pension as opposed to disability
allowance seems to last temporarily only. In that case, she receives disability pension in an amount
of 75 percent of her theoretical PAYG pension for her service period and respective wage history.
Alternatively, she might decide to return to the PAYG system. Her private pension fund is then
obliged to transfer contributions accumulated on her private account to PAYG, and she obtains a
full PAYG pension. As explained in para. 45, by end April 2000, more than 8,000 persons had
switched back and almost all were persons who had been declared disabled and became eligible
for a disability pension. It seems clear that, because of the unsatisfactory system of medical
certification of work disability, expenditures related to disability pensions for
under-retirement-age workers are much higher in the unreformed public system than they would
be with a privately managed disability insurance system.
3.    Funded Pension System
The development of the mandatory funded pension system has been satisfactory. Voluntary
private pension funds were authorized in 1994. Their initial growth was mostly motivated by the
generous tax treatment conferred on pension contributions. These included a large tax credit as
well as exemption from social security taxes. Offering salary increases to middle and high-income
workers in the form of pension contributions became an efficient tax saving device. Their asset
growth accelerated in later years. The law authorized the establishment of both closed and open
funds in the form of mutual associations by employers, professional associations, trade unions,
regional entities and financial institutions. More than half of the authorized funds, accounting for
85 percent of membership, were open funds. About 270 funds were licensed, but most had small
membership and little prospect of rapid expansion. In 1999, only about 160 funds were active and
submitted regular returns.

The largest funds in terms of assets or affiliates have been set up as open funds by financial groups
(OTP, Budapest Bank, NN, Aegon, Hungaria, and Winterthur). However, large employers, such
as MATAV (telecom), MOL (oil) and the railways, have set up employer funds. These are closed
funds or at most semi-open funds (e.g., the MATAV is open to all people employed in the
communications sector and effectively operates as a multi-employer fund).
Membership expanded from 5 percent of the labor force in 1995 to 25 percent in 1999, when it
exceeded 1 million affiliates (Figure 13). Initially total assets accumulated slowly but continued to
grow after the introduction of the mandatory pillar (Figure 14). They reached 1.5 percent of GDP
in 1999. Their growth reflected the contractual nature of pension saving and the impact of
compound interest as well as the expansion of membership. Despite the large number of pension
funds, concentration is high. At the end of the second quarter of 1999 the 10 largest funds
accounted for 51 percent of total assets and 45 percent of affiliates.
The structure of the voluntary pillar has three main characteristics. The first is its fragmentation.
Among reporting funds, 20 have less than 100 members each, while 53 funds have less than 1000.
This creates difficulties for the effective supervision of voluntary pension funds and also raises
questions about their efficiency and performance. Many of the small funds fail to provide regular
reports, leaving a gap in the transparency of the system. However, some of the small funds may be
operated like investment clubs and may achieve a reasonably good performance. As long as they
do not adopt ambitious expansion plans,, they could be financially viable.
The second characteristic is the tilt of the voluntary pillar in favor of middle-to-high income
workers and in favor of those working for large em=loyers. Contributions to voluntary pension
funds are exempt from social security taxes and also benefit from a 50 percent income tax credit
at a time when the highest marginal rate of personal income tax is 44 percent The tax credit was
reduced to 30 percent in January 2000, while other less significant changes were also made in the tax
treatment of voluntary pension funds. Contributions to the mandatory pillar enjoy weaker tax incentives.
While exemption from social security taxes is also beneficial to low-income workers, the benefit
from the tax credit is irrelevant for workers with no income tax liability. It is also of little value to
tax-paying workers with a low disposable income who can ill afford to commit to the long-term
contractual saving that is inherent in pension saving. In addition, small firms, which abound in the
service sector, are less likely than large corporations to sponsor pension funds for their
employees.
The third characteristic is their weak governance. This is linked to the legal form of the pension
funds. Mutual associations are in theory owned by their members and their operations are
governed by the general assembly and the board of directors that is elected by the members. In
practice, however, the largest open funds are controlled by their sponsors and governance relies
on transparency rules and the vigilance of supervisors and external professionals (auditors,
actuaries and custodians). The legal framework imposes a fiduciary duty on directors to serve the
best interests of members, but does not require the presence of

independent non-executive directors. Moreover, there are no legal provisions to limit potential
conflicts of interest and ensure that transactions with related parties are effected on market terms
and conditions.
Evolution and Structure of the Mandatory Funded System
The design of the structure of the mandatory pillar built extensively on the experience gained in
the operation of the voluntary pillar. The same legal form of mutual associations has been adopted
for the mandatory pillar, but to avoid fragmentation a minimum size of 2,000 affiliates has been
imnposed. The leading sponsors are the same large financial groups and large employers like
MATAV. Since the introduction of the mandatory pillar, 38 pension funds started operations, but
their number has declined to 25 and may fall further as a result of mergers.
Despite the freezing of the contribution to 6 percent, participation in the mandatory pillar
increased rapidly, reaching 2 million workers in September 1999, or the equivalent of 50 percent
of the labor force (Figure 13). There was a large increase in the last two months of switching
eligibility in the summer of 1999. Membership rose by more than half a million workers (or 33
percent) in the third quarter of 1999. In the future, the growth of membership will be limited to
the new workers joining the labor force. However, during 2000 a reduction in membership may
occur as workers have the right until December 2000 to switch back to the public pillar. It is
difficult to estimate the likely loss of members, but since most members are of young age and
there is significant uncertainty about the long-term future of public pension benefits, the outflow is
unlikely to be very large. Adding the two pillars together, and allowing for workers who
participate in both pillars, pension fund coverage probably exceeds 65 percent of the labor force.
The total assets of second pillar institutions rose at a rapid pace (Figure 14). They were expected
to reach 0.9 percent of GDP in 1999. Concentration in the second pillar is much higher than in
- 14 -



the voluntary pillar. At the end of the second quarter of 1999, the five largest funds accounted for
78 percent of all members and 73 percent of total assets. Only 8 funds had less than 5,000
members, testifying to the success of the policy against fragmentation of the mandatory pillar.
Regulatory Framework
A generally sound regulatory framework has been put in place, although there are some important
weaknesses. The regulatory framework is broadly similar for both pillars, although it is stricter
and more rigorous for the mandatory pension funds. Voluntary pension funds can be established
as mutual associations without any minimum capital or membership, even when they intend to
offer annuities. In the mandatory pillar, there is a minimum size requirement of 2,000 members for
any pension fund and 25,000 members for those that offer annuities. In addition, annuity
providing funds must create a capital reserve of HUF 100 million. The law allows voluntary
pension funds to convert into mandatory funds, but subject to a two-third voting majority of their
members.
Despite the emphasis on mutual associations, most of the private pension funds, especially in the
mandatory pillar, are sponsored and effectively "owned" and "controlled" by large financial
institutions and some large employers. Reflecting the opening of the Hungarian banking, insurance
and fund management markets to foreign ownership, most of the leading pension funds have
strong foreign financial institutions among their sponsors.
The law stipulates that pension funds are separate legal entities and their assets must be
segregated from those of sponsoring employers or other founders. There are detailed rules on
fund governance that aim to preserve the independence of pension fund management. In practice,
however, the funds operate as special types of mutual funds and are managed by their sponsors.
Pension funds are required to employ or use the services of certified professional asset managers,
accountants, auditors, actuaries, and custodians. They must use a single custodian institution,
which will be responsible for the safekeeping of assets and for ensuring that asset managers
comply with asset allocation policies and prescribed investment limits.
The funds are required to employ professionally licensed asset managers if they have assets of less
than HUF 100 million. A minimum capital requirement on external asset managers is imposed.
This amounts to HUF 100 million for small pension funds and HUF 500 million for pension funds
with over HUF 2 billion in assets. To ensure asset diversification and limit the risk exposure of
pension funds, investments are subject to quantitative limits by asset class as well as individual
investments. No individual investment may exceed 10 percent of the assets of the fund (fund limit)
or 10 percent of the liability or equity of the issuer (issuer limit). Quantitative investment limits on
Hungarian pension funds appear reasonable and are unlikely to be binding and to affect marginal
investment decisions, at least in their early years of operation.
An important weakness of Hungarian pension funds emanates from their effective operation on
profit-participating endowment insurance rather than mutual fund principles. This is because
market valuation of assets is required only once a quarter, while the crediting of declared interest
is effected only once a year. This allows significant room for the creation of hidden reserves and
- 15 -



the manipulation of reported investment returns. It is a shortcoming that may affect the operating
efficiency of funds and may also have implications for the transparency of the whole system and
the security of assets. This regulatory weakness originates in the opposition to the adoption of the
mutual fund model by both critics of the pension reform program and representatives of financial
institutions, especially insurance companies. The attitudes of the latter may have changed, as is
evidenced by the successful launching of unit-linked policies by leading insurance companies.
To ensure a high level of transparency, pension funds are required to disclose their terms and
conditions to new members and to send annual statements to all their members. They must also
indicate very clearly the operating fees and other charges. The law allows exit fees (fees for
switching) as well as performance fees. In addition, most funds impose an entry (collection) fee
and an asset management fee. The latter is deducted from the investment returns reported by asset
managers.
The transparency of Hungarian funds still lacks the vigor of the Latin American systems. This is
because individual statements are less frequent and the funds do not report net asset values on a
daily or even monthly basis. Moreover, neither the supervision agency nor any rating company
publish detailed comparisons of the performance of individual pension funds.
Two types of guarantees are offered in the second pillar. First, the minimum level of second pillar
pensions is equal to 25 percent of the pension from the unfunded public pillar. Second, pension
funds must make up any shortfall in individual returns if investment performance is below
government bond returns by more than 15 percent. Investment income that exceeds bond returns
by more than 40 percent is held in a profit fluctuation reserve. Calling of the first guarantee may
be affected by the freezing of the contribution to 6 percent. Using a bond index as a benchmark
for the second guarantee may distort pension fund investments in favor of bonds. A balanced
benchmark may be more appropriate.
Performance of the Pension Funds
Unfortunately, good data on the operating fees and costs and the investment returns of the private
pension funds are not readily available. Published statistics leave much to be desired. They mix
income and cash-flow statement data and do not allow a clear derivation of total investment
income. The failure to use a mutual fund approach with regular calculation of net asset values has
also obscured the picture.
The performance of pension funds was adversely affected by the financial crises of recent years,
especially the collapse of Russian markets in the summer of 1998, and by the very high volatility
of equity markets. The total return index of the Budapest Stock Exchange plummeted by more
than 40 percent during the third quarter of 1998 and by more than 20 percent for the whole of
1998.
In general, both the voluntary and mandatory pension funds have stayed well within the
quantitative limits imposed on their equity holdings. The prudential limits on individual equity
holdings could have a negative effect on the performance of pension funds as the three largest,
- 16 -



most actively traded and best performing Hungarian equities, MATAV, MOL and OTP, account
collectively for 65 percent of the aggregate market capitalization and trading of the Budapest
Stock Exchange. However, given the low level of equity holdings, any such negative effect is
likely to have been of marginal significance.
Operating Fees and Costs. In the case of voluntary funds, operating fees absorbed 5.5 percent of
contributions in 1995. This rose to 7.3 and 7.4 percent in 1996 and 1997 respectively and then fell
to 6.1 percent in 1998. In the first two quarters of 1999 operating fees edged up slightly to 6.5
percent. For the mandatory funds, reported operating fees accounted for 10.8 percent of total
contributions in 1998, falling to 7.8 percent in the first two quarters of 1999. These rates are
lower than those reported for Latin American pension funds where operating fees amount to
between 15 and 25 percent of contributions. Three reasons may account for this. First, in
Hungary, there are additional charges for asset management and external administration, and these
add between 50 and 100 fee basis points for most mandatory funds and perhaps somewhat higher
fees for small voluntary funds. In Chile and Argentina, only collection fees are allowed to be
charged. Second, sponsors of pension funds in Hungary may absorb a higher proportion of
operating costs. Employer-sponsored funds in particular are reported to subsidize the operations
of pension funds by providing rent-free premises and by not charging for the time of staff who are
involved in the administration of pension funds. Third, there is less emphasis on switching funds in
the Hungarian system and thus pension funds spend less on marketing and on commnissions to
selling agents. Full economic data would probably show a smaller difference in operating costs,
although Hungarian funds are likely to be somewhat cheaper.
Investment Returns. Data on investment returns are even less satisfactory. Published data do not
include any unrealized capital gains or losses as well as accrued but not yet received dividends and
interest. To shed some light on the performance of pension funds investment returns were
simulated by average quarterly asset allocations of pension funds for 1998 and the first three
quarters of 1999 and the total market returns on bank deposits, bonds, and equities. As pension
funds invest heavily in government bonds, the simulation results are likely to reflect adequately the
investment opportunities available to pension fund managers.
The calculations show that, assuming a quarterly investment horizon, gross investment returns of
pension funds amounted to 17.0 percent for the mandatory funds in 1998 and to 13.8 percent for
the voluntary funds against an inflation rate for the year of 14.3 percent. For the first three
quarters of 1999 the (annualized) investment returns were respectively 13.4 and 12.8 percent for
the mandatory and voluntary funds against an inflation rate of probably less than 10 percent.
Allowing for asset management and custodial fees and a reasonable amortization allowance for
the front load charged on individual accounts, it is likely that, except for the voluntary funds in
1998, the real returns on individual accounts were positive in real terms, though not much above
zero. Some individual pension funds report higher investment returns. For example, the MATAV
pension fund and OTP (the large savings bank) report higher rates for their mandatory and
voluntary funds (Table 4). However, it is not clear if they reflect better than average performance
or a difference in the way returns are calculated.

The relative underperformance of voluntary funds, especially in 1998, is explained by the greater
weight of equities in their portfolios compared to the mandatory funds. Voluntary funds had
allocated nearly 25 percent of their assets in equities at the end of June 1998 against 15 percent
for the mandatory funds (Figures 15 and 16). When equity prices plunged, the voluntary funds
suffered bigger losses. Reported data

show that between the ends of the second and third quarter the book value of equity holdings did
not decline but the share of equity holdings in the total portfolios fell substantially. This is
compatible with two possible explanations. Either the pension funds did not unload their holdings
of equities but rebalanced their portfolios

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
J. I Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Very adverse demographic trends and a difficult international financial environment (especially the
impact of the Russian crisis of 1998 on Hungarian financial markets) have affected outcomes.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Two major legal and policy changes have affected outcomes:
(i) the postponement of the increase in the contribution rate to the second pillar as indicated in the
original law adopted by Parliament
(ii) the delay in the transition from a wage-based to a wage-price indexation scheme
In addition, initial problems with the information, registration and payment systems for the new
mandatory funded system which, in hindsight should have received more attention, have affected
the implementation of the reform.

6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating:
In order to examine the sustainability of the program, simulations with an actuarial model of the
Hungarian pension system are carried out. First, we measure the impact of the measures designed
to improve the balance of the PAYG and contrast the situation with a "no reform" scenario.
Second, we measure the direct fiscal impact of the introduction of the mandatory funded system
in combination with reforms of the PAYG. The macroeconomic assumptions used are described
in Table 3, with the exception of a slightly higher growth rate of the labor force in the scenarios
which include an increase in the retirement age (which also implies slightly higher rates of GDP
growth, given the assumption of a constant labor share).

We first review the impact of the two major reform measures, namely, the increase in the
retirement age and the shift toward mixed (50% price- 50% wage) indexation. Other measures
such as the changes in the benefit formula and the tax treatment have an impact on particular
workers but little or no impact on the aggregate balance of the PAYG. As shown in Figure 8, the
new retirement age rules reduces significantly the projected deficits. This is due not only to the
increase in the statutory normal and early retirement ages over time, but also to the increase in the
number of years required to take early retirement. After 2008, the minimum number of years
- 21 -



required to retire at age 59 rises to 37, although penalties are applied. Meanwhile, retirement at
age 62 without any penalty is possible only after 40 years of contributions (or equivalent credits)
in the system. While it is difficult to predict retirement behavior in the face of the new penalties or
the average number of contribution years, reasonable assumptions suggest an increase in the
effective retirement age for men and women of roughly 2 and 5 years respectively. The longer
working period raises pensions and replacement ratios, given the positive accrual rate schedule,
but the higher pension is received for fewer years and some individuals continue to contribute to
the scheme. The net effect is an average annual reduction in future deficits of about 1.5-2 percent
of GDP.
While the retirement age increase has an important impact, it is only when the new indexation
method is added to the reform package that the balance of the PAYG moves into an extended
period of surplus. Figure 10 shows how these surpluses peak in 2013, which is the year when the
baby boom cohorts whose retirement was delayed by the last increase in the retirement age begin
to retire. Later, deficits reemerge when a second demographic shock hits the PAYG scheme
around 2035. With an increase in life expectancy of two years per decade assumed, the retirement
age increase to 62 is not sufficient to offset the demographic developments and to maintain a
constant retirement duration in the very long run. It must be stressed that the savings generated
by the indexation measure rely on the growth of real wages.

These two major parametric reforms generate an average annual improvement in the PAYG
balance of more than 4 percent of GDP during the projection period. The implicit pension debt,
measured according to an accrued benefit obligation (ABO) definition, is reduced from 309
percent of GDP in the no reform scenario to 241 percent of GDP with the PAYG reforms, a
reduction of more than 20 percent.
Up to this point, the package of reform measures results in a significant improvement in the
finances of the PAYG during the next decade, followed by a gradual erosion of the surpluses at
the end of the following decade. The pension system would record deficits again at the end of the
projection period, and the elimination of these deficits would require further reforms of the
PAYG, such as a further increase in retirement age (say to 65 years as in most OECD countries)
or the adoption of price indexation. Nevertheless, the reform measures achieved a significant
- 22 -



reduction in future deficits and the implicit pension debt. In fact, the reforms produced some
small but significant surpluses .
Despite the presence of these surpluses, the government (before May 1998 elections) never gave
serious consideration to a reform package limited to improving the PAYG scheme, as it saw four
serious shortcomings in such a solution: First, the accumulation of surpluses in the PAYG would
provide an easy opportunity to reverse the reforms through politically-motivated benefit increases.
Second, it would have created a new role for the public pension fund as an asset manager. There
is little reason (grounded either in Hungarian history or in the international experience) to believe
that such an arrangement would lead to efficient investment allocation or good corporate
governance. Third, this solution was unlikely to contribute to the type of capital market
development which a multipillar package is capable of generating. Finally, the promise of higher
returns in the private scheme, even after taking into account higher administrative costs, helped
offset the benefit reductions in the PAYG scheme and simultaneously diversified the workers' risk
in the long-run. This positive aspect of the overall package was instrumental in generating
support, especially among younger voters. In view of these and other perceived advantages, the
new system was designed to divert the savings generated by the reform to a competitive and
privately-managed pension funds referred to as the second pillar.
Simulations with a 6 Percent Contribution to the Second Pillar
We performed simulations of the full multi-pillar package (i.e., including the introduction of the
second pillar) assuming initially that the number of switchers will stay the same as of September
1999, and that the contribution rate to the second pillar will be maintained at 6 percent
indefinitely. The economic and demographic assumptions are the same as those adopted for the
full PAYG reforns (see table 3).
Figure 9 confinns the obvious fact that allowing switching workers to divert part of their
contributions to the second pillar causes an irmmediate revenue loss to the PAYG. The revenue
losses increase rapidly to around 0.8 percent of GDP in the first 4-5 years of the reform, and then
keep increasing at a much more gradual pace to reach 1.4 percent of the GDP in the third decade,
when most of the active population will be enrolled in the new system. The PAYG reforms more
than offset the revenue loss, allowing a reduction in the deficit. The system is actually projected
to generate small surpluses at the end of the decade, even considering the revenue losses, but
turns into deficits again in the second decade, with the retirement of the baby boom generations.
The growing deficits peak around 2022 and then decline significantly as the first significant
cohorts to receive first pillar benefits in the new system retire (i.e. those in their mid-thirties in
1998). The difference between the PAYG balances with and without the opt out to the second
pillar increases until about that time and narrows thereafter. By 2045 the deficit in the multipillar
system is actually smaller than the PAYG deficit had the second pillar not been introduced. These
results are driven by two factors. First, the replacement ratio of the first pillar of the new system
is about three fourths of the replacement ratio in the reformed PAYG. Thus, the temporary
imbalances between replacement ratios and contributions created by the opt-out starts to taper off
- 23 -



after the cohorts in the mixed system begin to retire. Second, the reform involves a reduction of
about one fourth of the accrued rights of workers who opt for the new system. As a result, the
valuation for the years of contribution under the old system are lower than what would have been
generated by the old benefit formula.
To detennine the first order impact of the reform on national savings, it is important to keep in
mind (as discussed in the PSAL President's Report No. P-7216-HU dated December 29, 1997,
para. 92-96) that the PAYG reforms have a positive impact on national savings (because they
reduce the deficit in public accounts) while the introduction of the second pillar is expected in
theory to have a neutral effect on national savings to the extent that the decrease in public savings
(resulting from the diversion of part of the contribution to the second pillar) is offset by an
increase in private savings. Figure 10 shows the public and private pension savings, i.e., the
PAYG balances with the second pillar opt out and the net private contributions to the second
pillar (gross contributions plus interests minus redemptions). Total pension savings peak at
around 2011, decline thereafter, following the decline in the PAYG balances, but would increase
again after 2020, when the first significant numbers of workers begin to retire in the new system.
The contribution of the pension system to national savings would start declining in the third
decade due to demographic aging. The private scheme starts maturing, with increasing
redemptions and smaller net positive contributions, while the public scheme shifts into deficits.
The overall net result is a decline in total pension savings to around 1 percent of GDP. In order
to eliminate the public deficits and increase total savings, the authorities would have to consider
further retirement age increases and/or a shift to pure price indexation.

PAYG Reforms Before Second Pillar
-Multipillar Reforms with 6% Contribution
The ultimate impact of the pension reform on national savings during the next decade depends on
the reaction of the budget to the PAYG deficits and the reaction of voluntary private savings to
the individual measures of the reform. As mentioned above, in 1998 the Ministry of Finance was
guided by a desire to reduce the overall level of the public sector deficit. Given these efforts to
converge toward the Maastricht Treaty deficit target of 3 percent of GDP (the General
-24-



Government deficit has been around 4.5 percent of GDP in the recent years), the impact of the
reform on national savings is likely to involve faster contributions to national savings in the very
early stages of the reform (due to the offsetting of PAYG deficits) and lower contributions to
national savings in the second half of the decade (when the PAYG surpluses would be
appropriated by the central budget). The average annual contribution of the reform to national
savings over the whole decade will probably not differ much from the first scenario depicted in
Figure 10.
[If the budget did not react to the PAYG deficit and the government simply financed by debt whatever deficit
occurred, then the impact of the reform on national savings would be equal to the total pension balance in Figure
10. This scenario would be equivalent to a mixed financing strategy, involving more debt finance in the first years
of the reform followed by more "tax finance" in the second half of the decade, due to the increasing surpluses of
the PAYG before the second pillar (and that result in a PAYG deficit smaller than the private surplus and a total
pension surplus). ]

The reaction of voluntary private savings to the reform parameters are more difficult to estimate
numerically, although it is possible to identify some of the changes that might occur. The increase
in the retirement age could induce some decline in private savings, whereas the change in
indexation would imply a decrease in expected retirement income, inducing some increase in
private savings. The expectations of higher returns on the six percent contribution to the second
pillar could have a positive or negative effect on voluntary savings, depending on the relative sizes
of the income and substitution effects. The net impact of these three factors on private savings is,
therefore, ambiguous, and would in any case be dampened by the existence of liquidity
constraints. On the whole, there is reason to believe that the reform package would tend to
increase national savings by approximately the amounts shown in the simulations.
The simulations above are based on a key assumption, namely, that the workers who have
switched to the new system will not switch back to the PAYG, at least not in large numbers.
Workers have until December 2000 to switch back to the PAYG. Indications are that very few
persons wish to switch back. By end April 2000, approximately 8,000 persons had switched back
and almost all were persons who had been declared disabled and became eligible for a disability
- 25 -



pension. If large numbers of workers in their mid-thirties (and forties) switch back to the PAYG
due to the perception that the second pillar contribution will remain indefinitely at 6 percent, the
PAYG deficits would be smaller, due to smaller revenue losses, but the private surpluses would
also be smaller, resulting in essentially the same overall pension balance. However, there would be
a number of adverse outcomes. Replacement ratios for the workers switching back to the PAYG
would be lower relative to a multi-pillar system with an 8 percent contribution to the second
pillar. The retention of the contribution to the second pillar at 6 percent would also entail some
efficiency losses, which are examined further below.
Simulations with an 8 percent Contribution to the Second Pillar
The reluctance of the government until recently to raise the contribution rate to 8 percent,
because of its concern over the larger transitional deficit, raises the question of what would be the
impact of this measure on the balances of the system and on the economy. This analysis is
summarized in Figures 11 and 12, where it is assumed that the contribution to the second pillar is
raised to 8 percent in 2002. The number of switchers is assumed to be the same as in Figures 9
and 10.
As shown in figure 11, the increase in the second pillar contribution from 6 to 8 percent would
imiply an additional loss of revenues to the PAYG and slightly larger PAYG deficits. The
difference between the

two lines would be 0.3-0.4 percent of GDP in the next decades. However, these larger deficits
would be offset by larger private surpluses, leading essentially to the same overall pension
balance, as shown in Figure 12 (compare with the overall balance in Figure 1 0). Therefore, the
increase in contribution rates to the

second pillar would not produce any adverse impact on key macroeconomic variables such as
inflation and the current account.
The difference between the two scenarios as depicted in Figure II is clearly artificial, since it
assumes that the number of switchers is the same. If a large number of workers switch back to
the PAYG, the scenario with a 6 percent contribution could actually be worse than the 8 percent
contribution scenario at the end of the projection period, since it would imply less reduction of
accrued rights, a larger implicit pension debt, and possibly larger PAYG deficits in the long-run.
The failure to restore the contribution rates originally envisaged could also imply some efficiency
losses. A smaller second pillar implies a weaker link between contributions and benefits with
possible adverse effects in the labor market. A smaller second pillar also implies more limited
capital market effects, due to the slower growth and smaller size of pension funds. It is difficult
to determine the quantitative impact of these two effects on economic performance in the
long-run with any degree of accuracy, but it is likely to be negative.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. 1 Lending:
Bank performance during identification, preparation and appraisal of the Public Sector
Adjustment Loan has been highly satisfactory. Staff were effective in working with policy makers
to plan an operation establishing a financially sustainable pension system while supporting the
balance of payments as needed.
The time between identification and negotiations has been unusually long because the focus of the
- 27 -



operation changed mid-course. Initially the Hungarian authorities and the Country Director
agreed on a broad-base adjustment operation that would support the public finance reform of the
government. This operation would have covered major public expenditure areas including
pensions and health care, as well as institutional reforms in public finance management and the
establishment of a Treasury. Some of the analytical work that was done in preparation for this
operation was eventually revised and published in L. Bokros and J.J. Dethier, editors, Public
Finance Reform during the Transition. The Experience of Hungary. Washington, DC: The World
Bank, 1998. Subsequently, when it became clear that there was no political support for structural
changes in other parts of the public sector (in particular in the health system), the operation was
redesigned and focused exclusively on pension reform.
The government requested technical support for the design of its new pension system and the
Bank responded in a timely fashion. The Bank had been accumulating technical expertise in this
area and its views (expressed in the influential report Averting the Old Age Crisis of 1994) were
respected by a broad spectrum of policy-makers. Bank staff in Washington and in Budapest
worked together with the Pension Working Group set up by the Hungarian Government on a
day-to-day basis for more than a year. The Bank's technical support significantly strengthened the
professional quality of the draft reform plans and enriched the discussions of the Pension Working
Group. The Bank also managed to involve international pension experts of top quality including
actuaries and lawyers. Bank staff had extensive discussions not only within the government-with
the MOF, the key line niinistry (the Ministry of Welfare) and the Social Security Funds-but also
with Parliamentarians and civil society including trade unions and political parties, academics and
Hungarian experts. Drawing on its technical expertise in the area of pension reform, the Bank
assisted the authorities in the conceptualization and development of an actuarial/economic model
to estimate the impact of the new pension system on fiscal accounts, national savings and growth.
This model, developed jointly with Hungarian experts, was extensively used by the government to
simulate the transitory and long-termn effects of various policy options.
Hungarian authorities, in particular in the Ministry of Finance and in the (interministerial) Pension
Working Group, have been very appreciative of the level and quality of cooperation that the Bank
was able to provide. The cost of such an operation was high for the administrative budget of the
Bank but there is no doubt that the returns on such an investment, though impossible to measure
adequately, have vastly exceeded these costs.
Borrower compliance as well as the success of the operation were facilitated by the agreement on
the objectives of the reform, the close cooperation between Bank and Hungarian staff and the"
ownership" of the reform by the government which was never in doubt.
The experience gained during the implementation of the PAHIlP enabled the Bank to identify areas
of crucial importance for the sustainability of the reforn. The PSAL PHRD facilitated the"
marketing" of the reforn by financing polls and studies which allowed the government to
communicate its importance and its details to the public.
7.2 Supervision:
Note that supervision activities have been limited given that this was a one-tranche operation. The
Bank agreed to release the loan amount in one tranche. At that time, macroeconomic indicators
-28 -



for Hungary were improving. The decision to have a one-tranche operation was fully justified
since the majority of conditions were met by the time the operation reached the Board for
approval; the macroeconomic stabilization measures of 1995 had had very positive results and the
macroeconomic outlook was very positive.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Highly Satisfactory
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Borrower performance during preparation was highly satisfactory. The government correctly
identified areas of crucial importance for the sustainability of public finances and demonstrated
clearly that they had a vision for the future of the country and the courage to take political risks
by embarking on a reform of such complexity. The preparation of the reform was facilitated by the
fact that Hungary can count with professionals (actuaries, economists, lawyers and
administrators) of very high international caliber. The work of the Pension Reform Working
Group has demonstrated that a high degree of interministerial coordination, professionalism and
commitment exists in the public sector. The Hungarian authorities should be commended on the
degree of professional openness and capacity that they brought to the identification of objectives
of the reform, technical and political preparation of the reform and level of details in the design of
an operational system.
Major laws have been prepared and passed on time. In addition, the Borrower took several
important steps to raise public awareness on pension issues; advise individual workers on their
pension system options (including providing individuals with easy-to-use software to calculate
their pension rights; discuss in the media who the potential beneficiaries and the losers of the new
system would be, and publicize the time schedule and deadlines for switching to the new system.
Some of these tasks were financed by the PHRD grant.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The performance of the Borrower in implementing the reform program has been mixed. The
implementation did not proceed according to the original plan (approved by Parliament) and key
measures have been modified and/or delayed by the new Government elected in 1998.
Implementation problems relate to three areas: (i) the increase in the contribution rate to the
second pillar as indicated in the original law on the pension system adopted by Parliament has
been postponed and no (ii) the transition from a wage based to a rnixed wage-price indexation
scheme has been delayed, (iii) there were some problems during implementation. The
implementation of the second pillar met initial difficulties, as the information, registration, and
payments systems had not been yet fully developed. These initial difficulties caused an initial
discomfort and, although these technical problems were eventually solved, policy-makers should
have paid more attention to practical and technical aspects of implementation. Moreover there
were also some weaknesses in the regulatory and supervisory framework, including several
aspects of asset valuation and disclosure.
In view of these problems, and particularly given the impact that a failure to increase the
- 29 -



contribution rate to 8 percent could have, Borrower performance in implementing the new
pension system should be considered on balance as satisfactory but cannot be rated highly
satisfactory.

Satisfactory
8. Lessons Learned
Hungary implemented a major reform of its pension system in 1998. The preparation of the
reform was supported by the PSAL. The new system comprises a public PAYG system, much
smaller than the initial one, and a new funded and privately-managed system. A voluntary, funded
and privately-managed pillar existed before the reform. The new system started operating in
January 1998, and became mandatory for all new workers entering the labor force from that year
on. Workers with accrued rights in the old PAYG pension system could choose to stay in the
reformed PAYG system or switch to the new multi-pillar system.
The new multi-pillar pension system is now in its third year of implementation. It has proved
extremely popular among the working population, and has attracted a much larger number of
workers than had been envisaged when it was designed.. Approximately half of the labor force has
joined the new system voluntarily. Most of the switchers are workers below 40 years of age, and
the young workers who switched account for more than 80 percent of the labor force in their age
group. The decision to switch was motivated by a number of factors, the most important being the
expectation of higher returns in the mixed system and the perception of political risk in the public
system. However, some overselling of the new system probably occurred as well, making older
workers switch, although they would be expected to be better-off staying in the reformed PAYG.
The new Government that took office in mid- 1998 proceeded with implementation of the pension
reform, which had been designed and implemented by its predecessor, but introduced a number of
changes to the original design. These reflected different policy objectives, e.g. with respect to the
cost to employers of social security contributions, as well as concerns about impact of the reforms
on public finances. The latter caused the Government not to proceed with the gradual increase in
the rate of contribution to the second pillar from 6 percent, to to 8 percent as originally
prescribed in the law passed in 1997. Unless this increase is effected over the next few year, there
could be important implications for some cohorts and for market participants. Recently,
Government has indicated its intention to proceed with the increases in the rate, but no timetable
has been adopted thus far.
The government's decision not to proceed initially with the increase of the the contribution to the
second pillar to 8 percent as originally planned was based on its concern that this would add to
the size of the overall general government deficit beyond the level it had targeted. Analysis done
as part of preparation of the ICR suggests that an increase in the contribution to the second pillar
would not have any significant adverse impact on the economy: the increase in the PAYG deficit
would amount to only 0.3-0.4 percent of GDP, and would not affect the rate of inflation or the
- 30 -



external accounts, as it wouldbe offset by larger private savings. The government's decision,
which was ratified by Parliament in an amendment to the original law, was not in line with the
objectives and the internal consistency of the reform package as designed, in which contribution
rates and accrual rates were jointly calculated so as to produce an equilibrium cut-off age around
3640 years of age. A significant number of workers may have switched counting on a higher
contribution rate, and this rate is not implemented in the next few years, some of these workers
would be better-off switching back to the reformed PAYG, which would increase the implicit
pension debt. Moreover, at the current contribution rate, efficiency gains in labor and capital
markets are likely to be smaller than originally anticipated.
The program has been unsatisfactory is the area of disability pensions. None of the reforms which
had been envisaged in the original design were incorporated into the reform package adopted by
the previous Government in 1997, nor have they been implemented since then.
This preliminary assessment of the Hungarian pension reform concludes that although
implementation of the pension reform did not follow the orginal design in all respects, the reform
has been successful, particularly as measured by the much higher than expected number of
workers opting for the new system, notwithstanding the less than expected contribution rate to
the second pillar. Considering the severe constraints imposed by initial conditions including high
fiscal deficits, high contribution rates, high tax rates and very adverse demographic trends, the
reform has been successful because it has reduced significantly the imbalances of the PAYG
system while also introducing a mandatory, funded, and privately-managed pillar that seems to be
operating rather well despite some initial problems in the system of payments and registration and
some remaining weaknesses in the regulatory framework. The remaining shortcomings can be
corrected over time, and this could be achieved relatively easily over the next few years, by
restoring the original 8 percent contribution rate to the second pillar and strengthening the
regulatory and supervisory framnework for private pension funds.
The precise impact of the reform on the welfare of different generations is difficult to assess. The
reform has certainly substantially reduced the heavy bias against future generations in the old
PAYG scheme, but the system is still projected to produce deficits in the long-run, despite the
PAYG reforms. Addressing these deficits will probably require further adjustments, such as
further increases in the retirement age and a shift to price (rather than wage) indexation, beyond
the steps already taken in this respect effective this year, which may reduce the higher levels of
benefits predicted for the new mixed system.
What are the lessons for other countries? The adoption by Parliament of the pension reform
legislation in the summer of 1997, and the first two years of implementation of the reform
demonstrate the political and economic feasibility of this type of reform for other countries in
Central and Eastern Europe. In fact, many other countries enjoy smaller fiscal deficits and lower
tax rates across the tax spectrum and, therefore, should face fewer constraints in designing and
implementing a pension reform of the type that Hungary is implementing.
The Hungarian experience also indicates that a voluntary switching strategy achieves essentially
the same switching outcome as a forced switch based on an arbitrary cutoff age, while avoiding
- 31 -



legal problems and contributing to the reduction of the implicit pension debt. The disadvantage of
this strategy is that it leaves a few individuals worse-off relative to their best option. A
well-designed public information campaign may minimize further the occurrence of these cases.
For the implementation of the second pillar met initial difficulties, the experience shows that well
developed information, registration, and payments systems are critical and that more attention to
practical and technical aspects of implementation is required from policy-makers. Finally, the
Hungarian reform would benefit from a stronger regulatory and supervisory framework, including
several aspects of asset valuation and disclosure. Although no major problems have been
reported, and these areas of the regulatory framework are expected to be improved in the near
future, a stronger regulatory framework could have been introduced from the start of the program
without major technical difficulties.

ANNEXA
REVIEW OF THE
PUBLIC SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
(4275-HU)
Borrower's Opinion
Background and objectives
Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PSAL)  supported with USD 150 miflioi tire
Government's reform program of public finances.
Structural reforms in public financial management and social insurance followed
earlier reforms of enterprise and financial sectors. The most important achievement
was in this area a comprehensive pension reform based on legislative packages
adopted by the Parliament in summer 1997. This reform established a multi-pillar
pension system, introducing a mandatory, fully funded and privately managed second
pillar to the upgraded traditional PAYG type first pillar allowance and keeping the
voluntary private pension schemes as a third pillar. The objective of the pension
reform was to ensure an adequate and balanced system of retirement income foir the
old, while eliminate the severe actuarial imbalances of the traditional public pension
system and promote national savings and the capital market and reduce distotins of
the labour market.
Preparation, implementation, sustainability
The preparation phase of the operation was rather long. It started on a broad basis of
various aspects of public finances. After detailed assessment, however, both the
Government experts and the Bank preferred to focus on the pension reform. The key
elements of the reform have been put in place before appraisal and negotiation. This
approach allowed designing a one tranche operation. Implementation of the program
went smoothly.
The government clearly supported the implementation of pension reform through a
smooth and on-schedule introduction thereof and creating the necessary legislation
framework. The initial steps of the reform were so successful that the number of re-
registered with the new system was more than 1 million in 1998 exceeding 700,000 as
anticipated. By the deadline of re-registration, i.e. by 31 August 1999, the number of
those who presented themselves in the new system was more than 2 million up against
1.3 million as previously calculated. This lead to a higher than anticipated lost of
revenue in the government budget.
33



The Government did not want to deteriorate the balance of the budget by increasing
the contribution to the second pillar to 8 per cent since the increase in question would
have caused an additional government deficit of some 0.3 to 0.4 per cent of GDP. The.
increase of the contribution rate is on the agenda in the next future.
In order to maintain the value of the pensions a new indexation has been introduced.
As of January 1, 2000 or 2001 net average earnings and inflation would be taken into
account with 70 and 30 per cent or 50 and 50 per cent, respectively in the calculaEion
of pension benefit.
Relationship with the Bank
Several earlier World Bank loans supported wide rangng policy, legislative and
institutional reforms which helped to create much of the foundation of a functioning
market economy. In the context of the PSAL operation, Bank staff provided valuable
knowledge of this specific field, performed analysis of several scenarios, involved
outside expertise, organized seminars etc. This excellent intellectual input contributed
to the adequate design and eventually to the success of the program. An additional
benefit was having expert Bank staff in the resident mission, available for day to day
consultation. The cooperation between Bank staff and Hungarian counterparts has
been outstanding throughout the project cycle.
Assessment of Outcome, Lessons Learnt
The PSAL operation is a good example that strong ownership of the proram,
flexible approach and clear design are key elements of successful implementation of a.
major program. One tranche operation and close cooperation proved very efficient..
