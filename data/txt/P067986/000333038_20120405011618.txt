F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The proposed project seeks to restore hospital operations and minimize losses in health status to
vulnerable populations living in the country's earthquake-damaged Central and Para-Central
Regions and to improve the health status of underserved populations elsewhere, with special
emphasis on the poverty-stricken Northern Region. This will be achieved by: (i) rebuilding and
improving health sector infrastructure damaged or destroyed by the earthquakes; (ii) extending
the coverage of essential health and nutrition services through a community-based outreach

                                                    vi
approach; and (iii) strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Health (MOH) to
develop and implement policies and priority programs for the health sector.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.    While El Salvador achieved significant progress in health outcomes in the 1990s, its
health indicators were still below the Latin America average and most of the health
challenges were related to preventable communicable and infectious diseases. Malnutrition was
highly prevalent among pregnant women and children under 5. Diarrhea and respiratory diseases
affected mainly the poor and young. HIV/AIDS had emerged among urban populations, and the
young, reflecting demographic changes.

2.     In 1999, at project preparation, about two million Salvadorians had limited or no
access to medical care. Poor, under-served populations were concentrated but not limited to the
northern part of the country. The most important issues related to inequitable access to health
services and disparities in health outcomes, with significant differences in health status between
low and high-income groups. While Government programs helped reduce disparities between
rural and urban areas with regard to immunizations and oral rehydration for diarrhea, other
primary health services, such as pre and post-natal care and cervical cancer screening, had to be
improved. Problems also surrounded the delivery of essential health and nutrition services.
Efforts had been made to improve infrastructure and hire personnel (health promoters) to deliver
preventive and curative health services in rural areas. While such efforts increased vaccinations,
they failed to ensure greater access to health services by the very poor. Further, the Ministry of
Health (MOH) had limited capacity to carry out its core functions, and needed to improve its
institutional capacity and strengthen management.

3.     In January and February 2001, the country experienced two earthquakes that
damaged health sector infrastructure and diminished MOH capacity to supply health services and
address the public’s health needs—especially in the central region, where the earthquakes were
the strongest. Of the 361 MOH health facilities, 113 were damaged, representing 55% of MOH
capacity to supply services. Most secondary and tertiary hospitals were aging (25-175 years old)
and had been built under less stringent seismic code standards than newer ones. Also, some
hospital areas were obsolete, having varying standards, poor maintenance and ill-defined
functions. Hospital networks had not been developed and there was no coherent referral system.

4.     When the earthquakes hit, the Government asked the Bank to provide emergency
assistance to reconstruct/rehabilitate health sector infrastructure, but continue to strengthen
essential health care for the poor, along with MOH’s management capacity, which were the
objectives of a Project being prepared at the time. The team explored the possibility of preparing
a stand-alone emergency project for hospital rehabilitation, and maintaining the other project
with its original design, but the Government preferred a single operation for all its health sector
priorities (Section 2.1).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

5.     The Project’s objectives were to: (1) reconstruct and improve the Borrower’s health
sector infrastructure damaged or destroyed by the earthquakes; (2) extend coverage of health and
nutrition services; and (3) strengthen the Ministry of Health (MOH) capacity to

                                                1
develop/implement policies and priority programs. The Project’s performance was to be guided
by key performance indicators covering the following areas:

         (a) Rebuilding and improving health sector infrastructure--measured by four indicators
         related to facilities constructed/rehabilitated and fully operational, functioning
         maintenance programs, improved hospital quality and reduced hospital stays;

         (b) Extending coverage of essential health and nutrition services--measured by five
         indicators related to vaccination coverage of children under two, prenatal visits and
         vaccinations, per capita contacts with health care providers, numbers of people accessing
         basic health and nutrition services, and children’s attendance of growth-promotion
         sessions in participating communities;

         (c) Strengthening MOH capacity--measured by seven indicators related to implementing
         strategies to improve the quality of care in five hospitals in gynecology, pediatrics and
         obstetrics; community knowledge of ways to control the breeding of mosquitoes;
         implementing policies and regulations on solid waste management; reformulating the
         health code; implementing a strategy to manage human resources; conducting HIV
         voluntary testing and treating HIV positive pregnant women.

1.3 Revised PDOs (as approved by the original authority), key indicators, and justifications

6.    When the Project was launched in 2005, the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) carried
out a baseline study, focusing on Component II. However, the baseline study had to be
discarded because it was considered substandard. The Bank identified significant problems with
sampling and methods that raised questions about the results’ validity. Thus, the MOH decided
to use the indicators included in the evaluation in the Red Solidaria Program1. The Project team
worked with Red Solidaria’s team to strengthen the health section of their instrument. While the
indicators Red Solidaria monitored were similar, they were not identical to those included in the
PAD. However, the MOH decided to use this evaluation as the monitoring tool to avoid having
to repeat baseline studies. At that time, this was considered the best solution, although the PAD
indicators were not formally revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

7.    The Project was expected to benefit:
      Component I: The original population served by the seven hospitals, estimated at about
       three million.
      Component II: Approximately 350,000 women and children. This population were
       located in 73 of the mainly rural areas in the impoverished northern region and in 26
       municipalities in the central and para-central regions. Beneficiaries in the north were to
       be targeted through a three-step process which combined geographical and household

 Red Solidaria, launched in March 2005 by the Government, was a program to provide assistance to extremely poor families,
implemented in the same poor municipalities that were part of the Project.

          selection mechanisms.2 In the central and para-central regions, targeting focused on
          people whose homes had been destroyed, incidence of malnutrition, and location within
          catchment areas of hospitals to be reconstructed with Project support.
         Component III: The entire population, by strengthening MOH capacity and improving
          efficiency and the quality of care.

1.5 Original Components: The Project financed four main components:

8.    Component I: Emergency Reconstruction of the MOH Hospital Network in the
Earthquake-Affected Areas (US$127 million). This component focused on: (a) replacing and
rehabilitating damaged hospitals and (b) preventive maintenance. The Project aimed to
rehabilitate and/or replace seven of the largest hospitals damaged by the earthquake. Three (San
Juan de Dios in San Miguel, San Pedro in Usulután and Santa Teresa in Zacatecoluca) were to
be rehabilitated and part of their equipment replaced. The other four were to be replaced (Santa
Gertrudis in San Vicente, Cojutepeque in Cuscatlán, San Rafael in La Libertad and Maternidad
Nacional in San Salvador).

9.    Component II: Strengthening Essential Health and Nutrition Services in Earthquake-
Affected and Extremely Poor Areas (US$16.5 million). This component aimed at: (a)
extending coverage of essential health and nutrition services in impoverished rural areas in the
north, by developing public-private partnerships, contracting and forming partnerships with Non-
Governmental Organizations (NGOs), foundations, cooperatives or government agencies. The
Project was to finance the per capita cost of providing these services along with the provider’s
startup costs related to training and consultants; (b) strengthening MOH’s primary care delivery
in earthquake-affected areas in the central and para-central regions, by financing minor
equipment, essential drugs and medical supplies to MOH care providers; and (c) strengthening
MOH capacity to plan the extended coverage, manage contracts and performance agreements,
and monitor/evaluate performance, by financing training, TA, basic medical equipment and
instruments.

10. Component III: MOH Institutional Development for Formulating Policy, National
Priority Programs and Support Systems (US$ 16 million). This component aimed to
strengthen MOH capacity to manage functions related to quality care, public health, disease
surveillance, regulations and performance-based monitoring/evaluations. To achieve these goals,
the component was to implement an institutional and decentralization strategy. The component
had three subcomponents: (a) institutional modernization; (b) strengthening MOH national
priority programs; and (c) strengthening MOH support systems.

11. Component IV: Project Management (US$ 4.8 million). This component was to finance:
(a) the management of Components II and III, including the design and implementation of a
system to monitor and supervise them; (b) an impact evaluation of the Project; (c) annual
financial audits of the Project; and (d) consultant services, facilities and equipment to maintain

  As indicated in the PAD, first, the 73 municipalities were to be identified through composite poverty (MIPLAN 1992) and
vulnerability (PMA 1999) indices. Second, based on a population-based survey (MOH 2000), the project was to target
municipalities with high indices of underweight children. These municipalities were to be the first wave targeted. Finally, within
the municipalities identified, households were to be identified through a mapping exercise carried out by contracted providers.

                                                                3
the PCU. The monitoring/implementation of Component I was to be financed through
Component I.

1.6 Revised Components: The Project components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

12.     Long delays in Project approval and start-up. While the Bank’s Executive Board
approved the Project in December 2001 and the Legal Agreement was signed in January 2002,
the National Assembly took more than 18 months to approve the Project; thus, it did not become
effective until September 2003. Further, implementation lagged in 2004 due to delays in
approving the budget for implementation and insufficient funds allocated (the MOH requested
US$7.7 million by March 2004, while the amount available was US$0.7 million). Although in
2004 the new administration expressed its commitment to the PDO, the Project did not begin
implementation until 2005. Implementation of Component I experienced even longer delays,
specifically for preparing the hospital designs and contracts for construction. Given the delay, it
was necessary to reassess the demand and cost for each hospital and update construction designs
and operations’ criteria.

13. Several Project performance indicators were changed. The Project adopted the Red
Solidaria monitoring system after the baseline study for Component II was discarded in 2006.
The Government decided to use this system to avoid having to re-invest in preparing another
baseline, and since the indicators were similar to those in the PAD, project indicators were not
formally revised.

14.     Final construction/rehabilitation costs were much higher than the PAD’s estimates,
which meant one hospital could not be built. (a) Costs were underestimated at preparation; (b)
from project preparation (2001-2002) and the start of the bidding process (2005), the cost of oil,
steel, and other materials increased; (c) by 2005, new, more costly seismic standards were
introduced; and (d) the ESEO (Works Supervision Firm) modified preliminary drawings for two
hospitals. Although the change was originally considered minimal, it ultimately affected the final
architectural designs and raised the Project’s overall costs. Since there were ultimately only
enough funds to construct six of the seven hospitals originally planned, the Government and
Bank agreed the loan would finance all the pre-investment plans for the seventh, the Maternity
Hospital, but not the construction itself. The MOH decided to finance its construction with other
sources in order to achieve the PDOs in a timely manner.

15.     Implementation arrangements changed throughout the life of the Project. The
PAD’s original implementation arrangements proposed two coordination units: (a) the
Infrastructure Executing Unit (IEU) in charge of Component I, which would report directly to
MOH; and (b) the PCU, in charge of all other components. This arrangement gave civil works
implementation to a construction management firm (CMF). In 2003, under pressure from the
National Assembly to reduce the amounts allocated to consultants, the Borrower declined to hire
a CMF and opted for a Works Supervision Firm (Empresa Supervisora de Estudios y Obras -
ESEO), while the management of Component I was to fall under the PCU. Implementation



                                                4
proved to be extremely challenging and the MOH modified arrangements in the PCU in May
2005, July 2007, and May 2008 (Annex 13).

16. The Loan Agreement was amended four times to extend the original closing date of
April 30, 2007 to October 31, 2011. There were five requests to reallocate loan proceeds among
the different categories. Amendments were made in September 2003, March 2006, April 2007,
February 2008, October 2008, October 2009, March 2010 and October 2010. The ninth (which
was the last) granted a reallocation of proceeds in May 2011. During 2009 and particularly 2010,
there were extensive discussions to consider closing the Project. Nevertheless, the Bank team
and regional management decided not to close an operation that had already disbursed most of
the loan but still had four hospitals unfinished. El Salvador was at the time facing severe
financial constraints; thus, withdrawing financing and technical support would have had more
negative than positive effects. The Bank considered that both it and the Government had already
invested significantly in the operation. In hindsight, the Bank’s decision to commit to the Project
until its completion was correct. Extending the closing date meant that the hospital construction
was completed and PDOs were achieved.

2. Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The Quality at Entry is rated as moderately unsatisfactory, based on the following strengths
and weaknesses.

       Strengths:
      Relevance of PDOs. The Project was in line with the CAS for the 2002-2005 period,
       including with its main objective of reconstructing seven hospitals damaged by the 2001
       earthquakes and reducing poverty, taking into account the earthquakes’ devastating
       effects.
      Timely reaction to the request for emergency assistance from the Bank. The 2001
       earthquakes provoked a sudden, profound change in the country’s needs. There was
       intensive discussion about whether to prepare a separate project to address the
       reconstruction needs or to include a civil works component in the already-prepared
       project. The Bank and Borrower decided to combine both into a single operation. The
       main reason was to work towards matching the supply of, and demand for health services
       (keeping the hospital interventions connected to those being supported by the original
       components at the primary level). However, the totally different nature of the
       components, the complexity of the hospital reconstruction process, and the weak
       institutional capacity were significant issues during implementation.
      Solid preparatory work. The Bank and Borrower conducted extensive preparation with
       support from a Japanese Trust Fund, to design Components II and III, which were
       included in the original project, before the earthquakes.
      Lessons from other projects taken into account. There were no previous Bank projects
       in El Salvador’s health sector but lessons from a previous earthquake reconstruction
       project in El Salvador (Loan 2873-ES) were taken into account. The main one was that a
       strong implementation unit is a key to success. The Project design separated the PCUs for

                                                5
       Component I and the rest of the Project, placing the IEU (Infrastructure Executing Unit)
       directly under the Minister of Health; also, consultations at the design stage about
       hospital design were held with different stakeholders.
      High political and sectoral stakeholder involvement resulted in strong ownership.
       This contributed to good implementation and proper sustainability of Components II and
       III. These two components were implemented with efficiency and closed in a timely way
       (February 2009). Activities related to these two components were expanded after the
       Project with Government funds.

       Weaknesses:
      Resources and the time needed to reconstruct/rehabilitate the hospital
       infrastructure were underestimated. The urgency of the preparation process,
       compounded with the usual difficulty of assessing infrastructure rehabilitation costs
       (versus new construction), contributed to this problem.
      Complex Project design and inappropriate use of the emergency recovery
       instrument. While the Project’s objectives and components were adequate in the original
       design, the inclusion of an entirely new Component I resulted in a complex final Project
       design. The preparation team used an Emergency Recovery Loan instrument to design
       the new Component I, but the Project, including the new infrastructure component, was
       prepared as a standard Specific Investment Loan Project.
      Choice of institutional arrangements. These arrangements - as described in the PAD
       and explained in paragraph 16 - were modified at the request of the National Congress.
       The main change was the elimination of a Construction Management Firm (CMF) to lead
       the implementation of Component I and its substitution by a Works Supervision Firm
       (ESEO). During the Project implementation, the PCU had limited capacity to monitor and
       manage component 1. In addition, the ESEO’s supervisory work of the civil works was
       unsatisfactory.
      Limited risk analysis. The overall rating of the risks was modest, which was optimistic.
       The main risks that seriously affected implementation were (a) the long period to obtain
       Congressional approval, (b) problems with awarding a contract to the management firm
       and (c) arrangements to implement the project components, in particular, Component I.
       All these risks were rated as high at the time of preparation. The PAD rated as modest the
       risk of insufficient leadership, oversight capacity and technical support provided by the
       MOH, which proved to be higher than originally anticipated. The choice of joint ventures
       (―asocios‖) to implement construction and the complexity of combining two projects into
       one were not seen as risks during project preparation.
      Project approval process by the National Assembly was substantially longer than
       expected. The National Assembly raised concerns about the Project design (i.e. a
       potential for privatization of health services through the use of NGOs to deliver health
       services, high cost of consultancies, and the definition of a basic package of health
       services). These concerns led to prolonged discussions in the National Assembly before
       the Project was finally approved in June 2003.

2.2 Implementation
17. Changes in administration had a positive effect on implementation. In June 2009,
when the new Government took over the Project implementation, it conducted an in-depth

                                               6
assessment of implementation performance, particularly of delayed civil works. With ESEO no
longer under contract (its contract was not renewed in April 2009 due to poor performance), the
PCU assumed the supervision of that component and audited ESEO’s performance. This analysis
revealed serious discrepancies between financial disbursements and ESEO’s reports of physical
progress. The new administration renewed its commitment to the Project and provided the
resources needed to conclude the hospital works. Further, it pursued legal action to recover the
contract guarantees from the construction firms.

18. Strong Government commitment to extend coverage. The PCU and MOH moved
rapidly to prepare and implement the contracts with the NGOs, once the national budget was
approved. The MOH also moved quickly to strengthen the primary health care units and was able
to compare the effectiveness of two different service delivery models (NGOs vs Government
providers). The strong commitment ensured full sustainability of component activities.

19. Long delay between Bank and the National Assembly approval. The Project became
effective in September 2003. The National Assembly wanted to reduce consultant expenses
(US$2.0 million) by eliminating the construction management firm (CMF) and asked the Project
to consider a Works Supervision Firm (Empresa Supervisora de Estudios y Obras - ESEO) and
reassign the management of Component I to the PCU. The cost of hiring the ESEO turned out to
be almost five times the amount originally budgeted for the CMF. This decision badly affected
Project implementation for reasons described below.

20. Uneven MOH management capacity and lack of leadership. The numerous
modifications to the Project implementation arrangements confirm the PCU’s difficulties to
execute the Project and its inadequate efforts to address bottlenecks. In the initial stage of
implementation, the PCU showed weak capacity and lack of leadership to take the Project
forward. However, from 2009-2011, the PCU adopted a stronger role and showed commitment
to achieve the PDOs; also, it made significant efforts to tackle the complex procurement
processes to conclude civil works on time—once the ESEO was no longer under contract and
two contracts with non-performing construction firms were cancelled.

21. Many factors influenced the implementation of civil works. These included (a) changes
in the implementation arrangements to manage the construction activities; (b) ESEO’s weak
monitoring/supervision of civil works; (c) MOH’s and the PCU’s weak monitoring capacity to
assess the quality of ESEO’s supervision; (d) the awarding of five out of six contracts to joint
ventures between a local and international firm which had no history of working together; (e) the
application of national arbitrage to resolve disputes arising during construction, which was
detrimental to the MOH and used by the firms to delay the pace of the works; (f) the significant
increase in the cost of materials and the approval of stricter seismic norms after 2004 for
rehabilitating and constructing new hospitals and (g) ESEO’s modifications to the preliminary
designs approved at the time the contracts were awarded, which, in turn, changed the
architectural designs and increased hospital construction costs (Annex 10).

22. Original institutional arrangements were modified. Given the Project’s complexity, the
original arrangements divided responsibilities among several entities. These included the MOH
with two PCUs, the CMF to carry out all implementation activities related to Component I, a

                                               7
procurement agent, and a monitoring/evaluation institution to oversee the implementation of
Component II. The decision to assign implementation of Component I to a CMF was based on
the MOH/PCU weak management capacity, which was foreseen during Project preparation. With
the modifications, the MOH and PCU were ultimately in charge of the entire Project, including
Component I. In addition, the procurement agency was never established and the
monitoring/evaluation of Component II was managed by the PCU, and then housed in the MOH.
Having initially a weak PCU in charge of the entire operation delayed implementation.

23. Budget resources were only made available in July 2004. Although the Project became
effective in September 2003, the MOF did not assign it a budget line until July 2004, at which
time the bidding process was launched.

24. Slow disbursement in the early years. This was due to several factors: (a) delays in
approving the budget (not until 2004), (b) adjustments to the functional and architectural plans
(Planes Funcionales and Planes Maestros Arquitectónicos) for the hospitals, (c) a change of
Government, which required discussing the Project with the new authorities, (d) delays in hiring
PCU personnel, and (e) adjustments related to extending coverage.

25. The complexity of the Project required substantial supervision budget and adequate
technical assistance. The complicated implementation of this Project demanded the Bank team
to strengthen its technical capacity to review complex technical specifications of equipment and
closely supervise the execution of civil works. To this end, the Bank hired a procurement
consultant on a full time basis, and two engineering consultants (one stationed in El Salvador) to
supervise implementation of the civil works. Technical visits were carried out, sometimes as
often as once a month. This effort, in addition to the long implementation time, required extra
resources; without them, the Bank team would not have been able to provide the support the
Government needed to finish the Project,

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

26. Originally, the IEU and PCU were responsible for monitoring and evaluation (M&E).
The PAD described a comprehensive M&E system which required that during the first year the
Government would prepare a framework/action plan to monitor the Project’s progress and
outputs, and assess its impact.

27. The PAD separated the monitoring of Component I from the rest of the Project. For
Component I, the CMF was to prepare its own Management Information System (MIS) and keep
the MOH informed. The PAD proposed a computerized system (financed under Components II
and III) to track the progress of activities in the field. At the time of preparation, it was agreed
that a baseline for those indicators would include measuring outcomes and achievements
regarding Component II shortly after implementation started. A Red Solidaria survey was used
to obtain baseline values for the communities and areas covered by the Project.

28. The M&E system was overly ambitious. Although M&E occurred, these activities were
not developed or implemented as designed. Ultimately, the PCU monitored all the components
since the IEU was not created; it developed a system to assess the Project’s progress, processes


                                                 8
and outputs, and prepared quarterly FMRs that described the Project’s physical and financial
progress.

29. Monitoring of Component I was weak throughout implementation. The ESEO was
responsible for monitoring and reporting the Component’s civil works’ progress to the PCU.
ESEO’s official reports on physical progress presented a gross over-estimate of the actual effort
and an inaccurate perception of Project performance. Following a Bank recommendation, a
technical audit was conducted that found inconsistencies between the payments made and the
reported physical progress. Thus, ESEO’s contract was not renewed (it ended in 2009). From
January 2009 to June 2011, the PCU closely monitored Component I progress, concentrating on
meeting deadlines to achieve the PDOs. However, some of the indicators used to measure the
Component’s impact were not adequate. For example, the hospital average length of stay (4
days) was already considered low at the time of design, and patient satisfaction could not be
measured, since four of the hospitals were completed just before closing.

30. Component II was regularly monitored and evaluated, once the initial problems with
the baseline were resolved. Data from the initial 2007 Red Solidaria report was used as a
baseline for most of the Project indicators. The main problem was that the data did not represent
the actual values prior to project implementation and therefore some of the targets established in
the PAD were no longer realistic. This situation made it challenging to assess whether targets
were reached. The M&E indicators should have been revised once the Red Solidaria baselines
were available (2007). In 2009, the Bank team considered formally revising the indicators and
targets. However, the Project was close to completion (at the time, the closing date was October
31, 2009 and the Bank team was uncertain on an extension), and changing the indicators for a
Project that was near its closing would not have been advisable. This situation continued for the
next 20 months. The Project was extended for only a few months at a time with final closing
date of 2011.

31. In 2005 the Project was finally launched and the quality of the baseline study,
conducted by a consultant, was considered to be technically substandard and was
discarded (section 1.3). It was then decided that, rather than investing more time and resources
in preparing a second baseline, the Project would use the work carried out under the program
―Red Solidaria.‖ While the indicators regularly monitored for ―Red Solidaria‖ were not exactly
the same as those in the PAD, they were comparable. Since the baseline data did not truly
represent the real value of indicators before Project activities began (Red Solidaria’s baseline
data were only available two years after implementation started), several of the original target
values should have been revised as well.

32. The Government designed and validated the proposal for an integrated management
information system before Project completion. The Project financed a Health Information
Unit within the MOH and also helped establish the M&E unit for a dozen priority programs. The
Project Monitoring System was used to gather data, analyze policy options, improve Project
management, and support investments. The baseline report and final evaluation of Component II
were extremely helpful in consolidating the extended health coverage within the MOH.




                                                9
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

33. The Bank’s environmental policy was triggered and an environmental assessment of the
reconstruction process was carried out during preparation and an environmental action plan was
agreed. The Project was rated as a Category B. The rating was triggered by: (a) management and
disposal of medical waste and (b) the hospital reconstruction. The Government complied with
the Bank’s environmental policies. Medical waste management activities included: (a) reviewing
conditions in each hospital; (b) developing guidelines and procedures to handle the waste; and
(c) training personnel. The Project helped set new, improved environmental safeguard standards
that are now practiced throughout the public health system and provided equipment to implement
them.

34. The procurement assessment made during preparation found that the MOH had
limited capacity. The original design assigned all procurement activities under Component I to a
construction management firm, and it did not anticipate having to further strengthen the PCU.
Given the original institutional arrangements in the PAD, procurement was not considered a risk.

35. Procurement activities for Components II and III were conducted in a satisfactory
manner. Moreover, they even surpassed the agreed targets in Component II.

36. However, procurement problems arose with two contracts in Components I. With the
first contract, the problem was that (a) the process was not conducted according to the one
established in the PAC, (b) a contract award was done through NCB, when it should have been
ICB, and (c) the process was not submitted to prior review, according to procurement thresholds
established in the Loan Agreement. In the second, a bid was evaluated under shopping
procedures based on an item list that differed from the one used in the request of expressions of
interest.

37. Although the Government demonstrated the deviations were not intended, they still
differed from those in the Loan Agreement and caused US$928,385.51 to be cancelled from
the loan account. This amount corresponds to the portion that could be financed by the Loan
(90% of the total contract amount). Although the Government demonstrated the deviations from
the Bank procedures were not intended, they still differed from those in the Loan Agreement.
Since the Loan has been fully disbursed, and such amount is not available to be cancelled, the
Bank will cancel only the amount already paid with Bank sources of USD 555,453.21. After this
amount is refunded by the Borrower, the Bank will proceed with the cancellation.

38. The PCU had difficulties managing the complex procurement process for the
hospital civil works. Some of the key issues were: (a) substantial delays in preparing bidding
documents; (b) frequent modifications to bidding documents and (c) excessive modifications to
contracts awarded to the construction firms.

39. The use of national laws to settle disputes in the standard contract documents was
detrimental to the Project. The conditions of Bank contracts establish that arbitration
proceedings shall be conducted according to the United Nations Commission on International
Trade Law (UNCITRAL) procedures. Despite Bank recommendations, the Government chose to

                                               10
apply the national arbitration law. Five of the six civil works contracts were subject to disputes
that cost the Government US$9.73 million3 in arbitration fees and settlements.

40. The Government had adequate financial arrangements by the time implementation
started, signed a contract with external auditors, and fulfilled the effectiveness conditions. The
PCU presented reliable financial information to manage and monitor the Project. However,
counterpart funds were not available as planned because Congress had not approved the Project.
Also, the Government contribution increased to US$33.5 million (45% higher than estimated in
the PAD) because extra resources were need to complete construction of Usulután, Zacatecoluca
and San Vicente Hospitals. The Government allocated US$11.55 million more to cover legal fees
due to arbitrations and settlements, and to continue expanding health services once Component II
closed. Thus, counterpart funds totaled US$45.05 million.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

41.       The Project activities are continuing as follows:

                The MOH new Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC) strategy
                 incorporated elements from Component 2. The MOH guaranteed that services
                 would continue in targeted areas after Project closing by contracting with NGOs,
                 using local funds to institutionalize and expand the Health Services Extension
                 Program. Under the CPHC model, the original 131 mobile NGO and MOH teams
                 were consolidated into 380 Family Health Community Teams (Equipos Comunitarios
                 de Salud Familiar – ECOs) plus 28 ECOs with medical specialization. This Program
                 now covers 1,234,081 individuals in 141 of the poorest municipalities (Annex 14).
                 Moreover, the MOF assigned $19 million to the MOH regular budget to cover
                 increased costs.
                The Health Coverage Extension Unit originally created under Component II was
                 consolidated under the Directorate for Primary Health Care Level. This Unit
                 now coordinates all efforts to extend health coverage.
                In 2011, the Bank negotiated a Specific Investment Loan of $80 million 4 to
                 support the Comprehensive Primary Health Care strategy—specifically to
                 expand coverage and improve the quality of care for the target population. The new
                 Project will support it through capital investments and the acquisition and
                 replacement of critical equipment. This Project is pending approval by the National

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

42. Project objectives were relevant to health sector priorities/strategies and consistent
with the 2009 Country Partnership Strategy, Report N 50642-SV. The Project design was
highly relevant. Component I was added to a project (to respond to the earthquakes of 2001) that
was being submitted for Board approval. Project implementation lagged during the initial stages
of the Project, in particular for Component I. Component II and Component III (for most of its
activities) were implemented at a satisfactory pace and completed in reasonable time.

3.2 Achievement of PDOs

43.   Project objectives were partly or completely achieved as follows:

(a) Rehabilitate/reconstruct seven hospitals and do preventive maintenance. This objective
was partly achieved. As a result of these investments over 3 million beneficiaries will benefit
from improved hospital services.

          Despite high costs and long implementation periods, 3 new hospitals were
           constructed, 3 were rehabilitated. All 6 hospitals were equipped with new technology
           such as integrated information systems, IT equipment, software and training that
           improved various hospital services.
          San Salvador’s Maternity Hospital was not built, due to delays in choosing a location,
           and funds no longer being available. But the loan financed all preparatory studies and
           equipment; and, construction is now being financed by the Central American
           Integration Bank.
          A maintenance program was launched in 6 hospitals: (a) equipment operators were
           trained and operating budgets increased in 6 hospitals; (b) standards were raised in
           other public hospitals, particularly for hospital waste; (c) maintenance manuals and
           training were prepared for all three levels of care; (d) electrical and heating
           equipment was upgraded, improving energy efficiency and (e) generators were
           installed, for medical equipment to work more effectively.
          Two other indicators - patient perception of care and reduced hospital stays - were not
           measured, since only 2 of the 6 hospitals were renovated in time to compare before--
           after conditions. Stays were slightly reduced in 2, but the baseline was low.

(b) Improve health status in earthquake-affected locales and poor areas by extending
health/nutrition services through community outreach. Based on 5 indicators, this objective
was achieved.

          Services were extended to 1.234,081 women, children, poor and indigenous people in
           the 141 poorest municipalities—for 353% of the original target. Around 284,000
           people were reached in the north and 352,000 in the central and nearby regions by
           2009, covering 100% in 100 target municipalities.


                                               12
       The Project supported two health service delivery models: the first contracted with
        NGOs for basic services and the second established health units within the MOH.
       DPT vaccinations for children under 2 increased by 20%. Coverage increased from
        2007-2011 with 86.2% of children under 2 vaccinated.
       By 2010, 79.6% of women had at least 5 pre-natal checkups, and also obtained
        tetanus vaccinations and iron supplements.
       Per capita contacts with health care providers increased by 50%. In 2008, NGO teams
        made an average of 7 visits a month per community and 2.6 per capita contacts a
        year; MOH teams made an average of 2 visits per community and 1.6 per capita visits
        in 2008; by 2010, the latter rose to 3.5. Also, 93.1% percent of children under one had
        at least five appointments to promote growth. Red Solidaria data show that post-natal
        visits increased to 89% of the women registered. Beneficiaries were highly satisfied:
        98% felt services improved their health and that medicine was available; 95.5% said
        health teams met their needs, they spent significantly less for care, and travel time to
        facilities was reduced.

(c) Strengthen MOH capacity to manage/promote quality programs, track diseases,
regulate the system and perform M&E. Measured by the following 6 indicators, the goals
were achieved.

         The Project launched strategies to improve care in obstetrics, gynecology and
          pediatrics in about 30 hospitals (surpassing the target of 5 hospitals and most primary
          care units).
         MOH vector-transmitted disease programs were strengthened (eg. on dengue and
          malaria), as was surveillance/control of entomology; medical personnel were trained
          in detection; and community awareness was developed.
         Goals for solid waste management/disposal in at least 7 hospitals and 7 health care
          units were surpassed, as were those for treating medical waste in public health
          facilities. The Project promoted new regulations, and helped get a national policy
          approved. All national hospitals had funds to transport/treat medical waste and new
          environmental safeguards were applied throughout the public health system. MOH
          capacity to manage solid medical waste was strengthened above PAD targets, and
          90% of health personnel were trained on how to handle it.
         A health code and proposal to organize the national health system were prepared and
          a national health law and regulations were approved, along with a comprehensive
          primary health care model. The Project supported goals for HIV/AIDS and helped
          prepare a national plan to prevent maternal/peri-natal mortality.
         A strategy to manage human resources was partially developed. The Human Resource
          Information System was improved and MOH was strengthened through: (a)
          workshops and study tours on preventive/curative practices; (b) computers and
          software for MOH central and local levels and hospitals to improve personnel
          databases and recruitment; (c) support for regulations on MOH internal control of
          personnel; (d) a manual to train facilitators and (e) non-economic incentives
          regarding mental/occupational health workers.



                                              13
          With help from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, 100% of women
           seeking STI treatment were offered HIV tests and 100% of HIV pregnant women
           were treated, surpassing goals of 50% and 25%, respectively.

3.3 Efficiency

44. The PAD included cost-benefit analyses for the three components. Economic benefits
were expected from reduced hospital stays and better management with the integrated system to
treat patients. Economic benefits would also derive from reduced mortality/morbidity. Health
indicators improved through expanded primary care coverage. Vaccination rates rose from 75%
of children under one in 2006 to 95.3% in 2010. Child mortality decreased significantly while
pre-natal care increased.

45. Civil works for the 6 hospitals cost 37% more than budgeted and took 12-27 more
months to be built than planned. MOH faced five lawsuits from construction firms, which cost
the GOES US$9.73 million in arbitration/settlement fees. However, it recovered over US$2
million from legal actions against poor performing firms.

46. ESEO management was inefficient. Its contract from 2006-2008 cost nearly US$10
million, but yielded few benefits, since it did not require construction firms to comply with
milestones. The Bank urged GOES not to renew ESEO’s contract, but it did until audits
(recommended by the Bank) found that ESEO reports were over-stated.

3.4 Overall Outcome Rating: Moderately satisfactory

47. The Project development objectives were achieved despite unsatisfactory Project
management by the Borrower, and the fact that the Bank did not restructure the Project in
early stages of implementation. The outcomes of the Project were moderately satisfactory
despite several implementation challenges faced by MOH. The original Project design made the
implementation of Component 1 difficult. However, many problems were addressed with
implementation support from the Bank team so that the Project activities could be implemented
and the outcomes achieved. Many of the indicators related to Component 2 were achieved as
planned.

48. The overall outcome rating is considered moderately satisfactory, based on the
following:
     PDOs at approval and completion were relevant;
     Activities designed to achieve the outcomes were relevant;
     Most of the indicators were fully or partly achieved (81 percent);
     Basic health services in remote areas affected by the earthquakes were extended. The
       Project served over 1.2 million people in 141 municipalities.
     MOH management capacity to plan/implement health service delivery contracts with
       non-public providers and manage agreements with public providers was strengthened;
     Although the implementation period appeared long, the Project was actually completed
       within 6.5-7 years since the budget was only available in mid-2004 and activities
       launched in 2005. For a project with complex civil works, the time frame is reasonable.

                                             14
3.5 Broad Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

      (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

49. The number of those with access to health services has increased, with vulnerable and
poor populations in the rural and remote areas in the North and Central regions
benefitting the most. By Project completion, the program was serving over 1.2 million people in
141 municipalities, of which 100 were the country’s poorest. Also, women of childbearing age
benefited: prenatal care now cover 58% of the population and over 96% of births are attended by
qualified personnel. Most (about 80%) pregnant women receive at least five pre-natal checkups,
which helps assure better health outcomes for themselves and their children.

50. In the municipalities covered, where previous levels of care lagged far behind those of
the national average, medical attention for children under one year of age increased from
82% to 90% of the population, and vaccination rates for rural children increased from 73% to
86.2% from 2007 to 2009. Children’s growth and nutritional programs increased to 93% of
children in 2009 from 86% levels in 2006.

51. Medicines are significantly more available due to the expanded services: 36% of
people claimed they did not receive the necessary medication in 2006, but by 2008 only 8.3%
said this.

52. The expanded coverage helped create demand for basic health services by addressing
key issues such as their cost, along with waiting and travel times. Average travel time to a
clinic dropped from a high of 60-90 minutes to less than 20 minutes. Waiting time was also
reduced from a high of 100 minutes to 79 minutes. Out of pocket costs dropped from $41
average a month per person to $3.

       (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

53.   The Project helped strengthen MOH in several areas. It contributed to the public
provision of primary health care services and to the adoption of performance-based financing.
The experience with NGO contracts and the management agreements (Convenios de Gestión)
between the central and primary care level led the MOF to select the MOH as part of a pilot
program for Results-Based-Financing currently being implemented.

54. Further, the Project has contributed to developing the recently adopted
Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC) strategy, with the Coverage Extension
Program as one of its key features. The Project supported the establishment of the Unit for
Extending Coverage (Unidad de Extensión de Cobertura) under the “Acuerdo Ministerial
N.1000? and its operations manual. By Project closing, the legal and normative frameworks were
approved and implemented, including the Health Law and Decentralization Law (Ley SIBASIs).

55. The Project has also contributed to institutionalizing MOH M&E capacity by
reinforcing a systematic supervision by each institutional level of the health system and the use
of an M&E operations manual.
                                                15
          (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

56. Flexibility during project implementation contributed to positive unplanned impacts.
While the Project was designed to rehabilitate and construct infrastructure, the Government
included features to improve the health system performance at different levels of care. It
introduced sub-projects to strengthen the management and functioning of the targeted hospitals,
provided a framework to review the provision of health services, and designed a manual for the
functioning and organization of the integrated health networks, after a diagnosis of the country’s
needs and a consultation process.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

57. A workshop was held in 2008 to share the results of the Red Solidaria evaluation to
assess the NGOs’ and MOH mobile teams’ performance. Stakeholders from the SIBASI’s,
NGOs, and staff from the MOH central level participated in the workshop and identified the
main challenges. Besides the 2008 evaluation and the final report on the expanded coverage,
activities showed that the Project achieved a high level of satisfaction among beneficiaries
(Annex 6).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes. Rating: Moderate

58.       The risks to the development outcomes are moderate, due to the following:
          The 2009 national budget allocated US$2.9 million to finance the human resources under
           the Project to extend coverage.
          Budget was provided during 2010 and 2011 to fund various activities (personnel, per
           capita costs of health services). By July 2010, the MOH had absorbed the cost of 2,266
           more staff and of service delivery into its regular budget. For this purpose, the Ministry
           of Finance allocated nearly $19 million additional resources.
          Budgets in all six hospitals were increased, on average by 75% since 2007.
          Personnel were trained in different areas (e.g. purchasing health services, managing
           medical waste, etc) with Project support.
          Policies and guidelines in HIV/AIDS and dengue were developed by Project completion.
          Since the completion of activities of Component II in February 2009, the main
           achievements in terms of extending coverage were consolidated within the MOH
           umbrella. The testing of the two modes of providing services allowed MOH to determine
           their comparative advantages and build on the results to achieve greater sustainability.
          In 2010, the MOH started providing services to 14 new municipalities in extreme
           poverty, where children’s growth and height were delayed.
          The purchasing unit established under the Project was placed in the MOH Planning Unit
           to handle contracts and performance agreements (now called annual operation plans). By
           Project closing it was functioning well.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry. Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

59. The overall rating for the Bank’s performance in guaranteeing the quality at entry of
the Project is moderately unsatisfactory. Despite extensive policy dialogue between the
Government and the Bank held during the design stage, the proposed institutional arrangements
to execute the Project were not effective during Project implementation.

60. Regarding the infrastructure component, there were positive elements as well as
challenges during preparation. The Bank supported in a timely fashion to the Government’s
request for support to reconstruct and rehabilitate hospitals that were severely damaged by the
earthquakes. The Bank was responding to an emergency, and the preparation team used an
Emergency Recovery Loan instrument to design Component I. And, after extensive discussions,
both the Borrower and Bank chose to have a single operation as a standard Specific Investment
Loan Project (as it was in its original design). A new component for the rehabilitation and
reconstruction of health infrastructure was incorporated into the Project already under
preparation in a relatively short period of time. However, the time and resources provided during
the Project preparation did not allow for a thorough, realistic assessment of the hospitals’
damage and health sector needs which resulted in an under-estimation of civil works costs. The
preparation team was not adequately equipped with the technical expertise the operation
demanded.

(b) Quality of Supervision. Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

61. The quality of Bank supervision is rated as moderately unsatisfactory as it failed to
require Project restructuring to revise the PDIs. The PAD indicators were never formally
revised because the MOH considered that a restructuring of the Project at the time of serious
implementation challenges would affect the Project execution and will increase its risk as
perceived by the Government.

62. Given the resources available, the Bank provided substantial, continuous support to
the Government during its implementation. In the initial stages, the team addressed the
National Assembly’s concerns with various Project interventions (such as contracting out the
provision of services to private providers and NGOs). After the National Assembly approval, the
Bank team provided substantial assistance to finalize the Operations Manual.

63. The Bank team made frequent supervision missions that were well staffed so as to
assist with resolving the bottlenecks it identified. It also appointed staff to closely supervise
the hospital civil works with frequent technical visits. The Bank team found that there was a
difference between the progress reported by the construction firms and the results certified by the
works supervision firm (ESEO). The Bank team raised this issue on supervision missions and in
2009, the Bank team advised the Government not to renew ESEO’s contract, based on its poor

                                                17
performance, and to cancel the contracts with the non-performing construction firms. Also, it
supported the Government’s efforts to hire new firms to complete the reconstruction and meet
the PDOs by Project completion.

64. As much as possible, the Bank tried to reflect in the Aide Memoires the shortcoming
and delays in executing the civil works as noted during the field visits, recommending
actions to be taken by the Government to move implementation forward. However, the
Government team resisted accepting a more candid reflection of the shortcomings of the Project
in the Aide Memoires.

65. The team also gave the Government extensive, continuous support on procurement
matters, which contributed greatly to the Project’s completion. This was possible through
frequent supervision missions, the recruitment of a full-time procurement consultant, and an
engineer specialist in the field. Further, the Bank provided the PCU with support to prepare the
bidding process for the hospital works; this was critical, given its lack of experience and capacity
on large projects.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance. Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

66. The overall Bank performance is rated as moderately unsatisfactory due to the following
strengths and weaknesses:
     Solid preparation work on the Project, in its original design (resources from a Japanese
        Trust Fund financed the feasibility studies on the extension of health coverage by NGOs
        and mobile teams from the public health centers);
     Capacity to react in a timely manner to the crisis created by the 2001 earthquakes;
     Continuity of the Bank teams whose members developed in-depth knowledge of the
        Project and the political economy context;
     Frequent supervision missions throughout the Project by a team composed of staff and
        consultants who were experts in the areas supported by the Project—but had limited
        finances, considering the complexity of the Project;
     Continued technical assistance and regularly monitoring and evaluation on site for the
        extension of health services component which surpassed the original targets;
     Continued support to the Government to address the shortcomings in the implementation
        of Component I, and to help achieve the PDOs, although with substantial delays;
     Perseverance by the Bank teams to work with the Government and the PCU to correct the
        deficiencies in implementation not addressed by ESEO, in order to provide consistent
        support to the Government to achieve the PDOs.
     Adequate assessment of risks during preparation but inadequate measures to
        address/counterbalance them;
     Inappropriate use of an Emergency Recovery Loan instrument to design a traditional
        investment loan.
     Failure to address the multiple changes to the Project with the required amendments to
        the results framework and the Loan Agreement;




                                                18
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance. Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

67. The Government’s performance is rated as moderately unsatisfactory due to
substantial delays in the completion of the works and the limited capacity of the PCU to
implement the agreed action plans in the three consecutive extensions of Project closing
dates. However, the factors explaining the long delay in Project completion are: (a) insufficient
budget in 2004 and 2005, to begin implementation, after Project effectiveness; (b) PCU staff
were not always hired based on professional criteria and the Government did not appoint a
highly qualified team that could have managed and led the implementation; (c) the Government
failed to address the challenges of the civil works in a timely manner; (d) insufficient political
support to make substantial progress in the human resource management systems or to
modernize the health sector; and (e) the Government failed to approve the Project in a reasonable
time period.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance. Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

68. Implementing agencies include the MOH, PCU and ESEO. Overall, their performance
is rated as moderately unsatisfactory due to the uneven performance in the different components.
Government performance for Component I is rated as unsatisfactory, while its performance for
Components II and III is considered satisfactory and moderately satisfactory, respectively.

69. Although the MOH was weak technically, it displayed a strong ownership of the
Project. It worked closely with the Bank during preparation and after Project approval. Its
technical units worked intensely on the implementation of all three components. The Project
provided technical assistance to the MOH relevant units to extend health care across the country.
The MOH did not succeed in building a strong PCU or develop its procurement expertise.

70. The PCU suffered from institutional weaknesses and frequent changes in leadership.
Once implementation started, it became the sole management unit for the Project although it had
limited expertise to manage and procure large, complex infrastructure. The PCU failed to make
the ESEO accountable for its work and to adequately address the changes in indicators and scope
of work (six hospitals instead of seven) by requesting amendments to the Loan Agreement and/or
Project restructuring.

71. However, the PCU performed satisfactorily in the implementation of Components II
and III and coordinated well with the MOH technical units. It showed strong leadership and
commitment during the last phase of the Project (2009-2011) was extremely effective in
completing the hospital works and achieving the PDOs. The new PCU team appointed in 2009
conducted a thorough assessment of the physical and financial progress of the works. With these
findings and with full support from the Bank team, the PCU cancelled the contracts with two
construction firms which had not complied with them. The PCU managed numerous
procurement processes in order to complete the civil works on time to meet the PDOs and led the
MOH legal actions that allowed the Government to recover contract guarantees for about US$2
million.

                                               19
72. The ESEO’s supervisory work was highly unsatisfactory and its contract was
cancelled in April 2009. The 2009 PCU technical audit revealed serious discrepancies (27%)
between financial disbursements and reported physical progress for three civil works. In
addition, the ESEO lacked commitment, ownership and incentives to propel the execution of the
hospital works.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance. Rating: Moderately
Unsatisfactory
     High political and sectoral stakeholder involvement which resulted in strong ownership;
     Good efforts to monitor the Project’s achievements;
     Good financial management and good-quality financial reporting;
     Closely working with the Bank during the preparation process;
     Considerable delay by the National Assembly in approving the Project;
     Delays in providing counterpart funds to support Project implementation
     PCU’s capacity to manage implementation was weak;
     ESEO’s poor monitoring and supervision delayed implementation of Component I;
     Inability to prepare a baseline in the time needed to monitor and evaluate the Project’s
       progress and achievements;
     Failure to work with the Bank to address the multiple Project changes with the required
       amendments to the Loan Agreement and adjust the M&E framework;

6. Lessons Learned

73. Borrower’s ownership and leadership during the life of the Project guarantees
sustainability. The MOH, under the three administrations, understood that activities under the
Project would strengthen the health sector performance and the primary health care service
delivery. The MOH continued contracting with NGOs with local funds to avoid interrupting
services once Component II had closed; and, by Project closing, the MOH had absorbed,
institutionalized and expanded these activities.

74. Use of incentives and results-based payment mechanisms can be critical to Project
success. The standard contract for complex time-based assignments was used, under which
remuneration is determined on the time the consultants spend carrying out services. This type of
contract is widely used for supervising construction and was thus correctly and in good faith
used to hire ESEO. However, the contract lacked incentives for ESEO to push the construction
firms for results, timely compliance with the milestones, and adhering to their schedule, since
their payments were not contingent on the firms’ progress.

75. Working with joint ventures for civil works can be challenging. This project provided
a case of ineffective joint ventures. The firms selected lacked previous experience in hospital
construction. The foreign firm did not have a solid presence and network in the country, which
meant it could not effectively communicate with the PCU.

76. Selection of the appropriate lending instrument and adequate resources are critical to
effective project design. The design and implementation experience of restoring physical assets
after a disaster shows the importance of assessing the appropriateness of ERL in terms of time

                                              20
and resources, and reassessing the needs and design against the latest sectoral trends. Besides,
the Component I preparation timeline and available budget were not sufficient to realistically
assess the damage and health sector needs.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.     Component I: Emergency Reconstruction of MOH Hospital Network in
Earthquake-affected Areas. The Project’s main output was the reconstruction and
rehabilitation of the following hospitals: Cojutepeque, San Rafael, San Miguel, Santa Teresa
de Zacatecoluca, San Pedro de Usulután and Santa Gertrudis de San Vicente. The component
included equipping the health facilities and the preparation of the pre-investment studies for the
Maternity Hospital of San Salvador. Staff was trained on how to operate the equipment and the
electrical plants, air conditioning systems, etc. and an agreement was reached to accompany
the staff for one year after the equipment was installed. At preparation, MOH designed an
integrated maintenance program for all levels of care with support from the German Technical
Cooperation (GTZ), to decentralize services. The program was to have 5 phases; at appraisal,
only 2 (sensitizing staff and preparing equipment and building inventory) were completed. The
Project was to support it with technical assistance.

2.    The Project included initially seven hospitals to be reconstructed or rebuilt. By
Project closing, six were rehabilitated or rebuilt, and one was supported through studies. Tables
2.1 and 2.2 show the times and cost of the works projects.

    3.       The factors influencing implementation of Component I are detailed below:

             Changes in the arrangements. By the time implementation truly began in 2004, there
              was no longer an IEU or a CMF for civil works. The PCU, which had limited capacity
              and lacked experience (both technically and with respect to procurement) to undertake
              this complex task, was responsible for its implementation.
             Supervision of the civil works by a single firm (ESEO). Civil works were divided
              into two phases, each involving three hospitals. It was expected that the MOH would
              hire a different work supervision firm to supervise each of the two phases. At the end,
              supervision of both phases was awarded to the same firm. The reason was that the firm
              hired to supervise Phase I was the only firm that submitted a bid in Phase II; thus, it
              was awarded the contract. There were several weaknesses in this process. (1) Having a
              single company supervise all the hospitals posed a high risk if the firm failed to perform
              adequately, which turned out to be the case. (2) The terms of the contract with ESEO
              failed to include incentives for the firm to work efficiently and push the construction
              firms to meet the agreed deadlines. Their financial compensation was not contingent on
              the works. (3) The staff had limited professional capacity to manage civil works.
             Weak implementation capacity at the MOH and PCU. The PCU lacked adequate
              technical and managerial capacity to assess ESEO’s poor performance. Moreover, at
              the beginning of project implementation, there seemed to be a strong relationship
              between the PCU and ESEO that compromised the PCU’s supervisory role. Further,
              ESEO began exercising some functions that were not part of its terms of reference--
              which the PCU overlooked for some time. In addition, the PCU had a limited capacity
              to prepare the technical work for the hospitals, which contributed to long delays.
             The nature of the joint ventures. All but one of the civil works contracts were
              awarded to joint ventures,5 some that were formed between a local firm and an
              international firm. While this is acceptable under Bank norms, there were several
              problems in this case. (1) The two companies did not have a history of working


5
  Asocio Temporal (joint venture) is a business agreement in which two or more parties agree to develop, on a temporary basis, a
new entity for the purpose of a specific project. This type of association is common in countries where there is no single firm
with the needed expertise to undertake highly complex assignments, such as the construction of a hospital. The association is
dissolved when the goal is reached

                                                              25
              collaboratively, which caused discrepancies between designs/works and modification of
              contracts. (2) Once the contract was awarded, the foreign company did not have a
              substantive presence or a management team in the country, which made it difficult for
              the PCU and MOH to fulfill their contractual obligations.
             Application of the national arbitrage law. Despite Bank recommendations to opt for
              international arbitrage, the Borrower insisted on changing the standard bidding
              documents to use the national arbitrage law as the norm to be applied in disputes. This
              decision proved to be extremely detrimental: Five of the six civil works were subject to
              a dispute that cost the GOES $9.73 million6 in arbitrations and settlements. Moreover,
              the firms used the dispute as an opportunity to slow the pace of construction, causing
              additional delays.
             Substantial increase in the cost of building and rehabilitation. Because the project
              was prepared during an emergency and added to an already designed project, the cost of
              hospital rehabilitation and reconstruction was moderately underestimated. Cost
              estimates for rehabilitation after severe structural damage such as that caused by an
              earthquake are particularly challenging, since the severity of the damage if difficult to
              quantify— particularly within an emergency context. In addition to the initial under-
              estimates, the long delay between the original cost estimates and start of construction
              significantly affected the final costs: Increases in the price of construction materials
              (such as cement and copper) besides the new seismic norms (introduced in 2004),
              which called for specific designs and materials, increased construction costs. Further, in
              2005, the functional assessments for each hospital, which took into account changes to
              the health care model7 and the decentralization process, introduced new operating and
              functional criteria which implied additional costs.
             Modifications to the hospital designs. The PCU provided the architectural,
              preliminary drawings that served as the basis for the construction firms to present their
              economic proposals and produce the final project designs, once a contract was awarded.
              With respect to Cojutepeque and San Rafael (two hospitals under turnkey contracts),
              after the contracts were awarded, ESEO modified the preliminary drawings, which
              although initially considered marginal, ultimately were much more substantial and
              affected the final architectural designs—which raised costs. While the Bank opposed
              these modifications, the MOH maintained its position. These were the first two
              hospitals for which contracts were awarded; and, based on this experience, no other
              designs were significantly modified.

Summary of Hospital Civil Works

    4.    Cojutepeque Hospital. This 80-bed hospital had 3,400 m2, and was between 35-175
    years old, depending on the part of the building. It was severely damaged, particularly in the
    oldest areas. It was located on seriously uneven land, which prevented it from being rebuilt in
    the same spot. Thus, it was built in a new location, as a turnkey operation (Llave en Mano).
    The contract was signed in February 2006; between the MOH and a joint venture (FCC

  Some of the changes, for example, reduced the number of beds, improved outpatient services, improved referral systems, and
offered a more accurate understanding of demand and supply (with respect to health care systems).

                                                                 26
Construcción, S.A. – Corporación M&S Internacional CA, S.A. – Grupo Ebidar, S.A. de C.V. –
IBADESA Exportaciones y Servicios, S.A.). The project was developed in two stages: design
and construction. The time periods originally agreed for each phase was three and 13 months,
respectively (16 months altogether). Work began in March 2006. An extension of 108 days
was given and the works were finished in November 2007. The total contract was US$11.57
million. Construction included hospital equipment, which represented 26 percent of the total
cost.

5.     The Project was the subject of a lawsuit which was decided against MOH. The total
amount was (still under resolution). The reasons for the suit were the changes made by ESEO
to the preliminary project prepared by the RHESSA PCU. The follow-up of the physical
progress in the construction of the hospital was done according to a work program which was
part of the construction design. The works were completed in 588 days (an increase of 23
percent over the initial time planned) which is considered reasonable, given the changes to the
initial proposal. The technical quality of the works was adequate.

6.    San Rafael Hospital. This 228-bed hospital had 16,000 m2, and was between 25-100
years old. The oldest parts were severely damaged, as was the tall structure of the building. It
was agreed that the Project would finance the reinforcing of the tall structure and the complete
rehabilitation of the rest of the building. This hospital was rehabilitated under a turnkey
contract, signed in May 2006, between the MOH and the joint venture (SIMAN – SUCOMEX-
ROJO). The project was developed in two phases: design (4 months) and construction (20
months). It was begun in June 2006. The initial contract was signed for US$16.87 million, and
equipment represented 21 percent of this amount.. Design and construction ran in parallel with
the reinforcement of the structure of the building. The progress of the construction project was
followed up through a work program agreed with the contractor at the design stage. The design
was redrawn in May 2008. The final cost was US$24.23 million. As with the Cojutepeque
Hospital, there was a legal suit, won by the joint venture against the MOH. Legal costs were
US$4.24 million (included in the amount above) and the case extended the closing date to
February 2009. This project took 985 days, 64 percent higher than envisaged. The works were
considered of high technical quality.

7.    San Miguel Hospital. This 338-bed hospital had 37,000 m2, and the building was 25
years old. It suffered damages of medium severity. The Project supported its structural
reinforcement and rehabilitation. This was the last contract signed, which occurred on January
2008, between the MOH and the firm ASTALDI. The process followed a traditional bidding
approach, where there first step was a contract for the engineering designs and studies. Based
on these results, the civil works were bid. The type of contract was unit price contract, to be
built over a 19-month period. Works started on March 2008 and were expected to end in
October 2009. However, the contract was extended twice: first, to August 2009 and next, to
November 2010. The rehabilitation was completed in December 2011. The monitoring of the
works was based on a plan given to the construction company. ESEO did not perform well in
the relatively small time period it was expected to supervise the works. The cost of the
reconstruction was US$31.80 million.

8.    Santa Teresa de Zacatecoluca Hospital. This 163-bed hospital had 10,300 m2 and was
35 years old. It suffered medium and serious damages, particularly to its main hospitalization
areas (towers). The Project was to finance the structural reinforcement and rehabilitation of the
building. The initial reconstruction was under a contract signed in May 2007 between the
MOH and the joint venture CPK consultants and Borelli & Merigo Arquitectura y Urbanismo
Ltda. The project had a two-phase process: four months for designing the works and 18
months for the construction/equipment. The contract (contrato a suma alzada- lump sum
contract) started in June 2007 and was to end in April 2009. However, it was extended twice:
The first was for four months, until July 2009. The second was until January 2010. However,
in September 2009, the PCU found discrepancies between the reported progress of the works
and the actual progress (approximately 47.58 percent). Thus, the PCU cancelled the contract
with the joint venture in November 2009, which was also due to the company’s failure to
provide guarantees. Once the contract was cancelled, the PCU had to arrange for new
contracts (contrataciones directas), price/quotes comparisons and bids. The new companies
were hired in January 2010 and the hospital was completed by June 2011. The final cost was
US$18.1 million, which included the cost to the MOH of US$1.45 million, as a result of a legal
negotiation that ended in conciliation.

9.    San Pedro de Usulután Hospital. This 138-bed hospital had 10,300 m2 and was 28
years old. It suffered medium and serious damages, in particular in its main hospitalization
wing. The Project was to finance the structural reinforcement and rehabilitation works. This
hospital was part of the first group to be bid and was prepared as a turnkey project. The biding
process was cancelled due to administrative problems that prevented the awarding of the
contract to the bidders and it had to be re-bid.

10. The contract was signed in July 2007 between the MOH and the joint venture CPK
consultants and Borelli & Merigo Arquitectura y Urbanismo Ltda. It was a two-phase process:
the first was for four months, for designing the works, and the second was for
construction/equipment, for 16 months. The contract started in July 2007 and was to be
finished in July 2009. It was extended twice: after conciliation it was extended for four months
and again, after December 2009.. The original amount of the contract was US$10.46 million,
but the final amount of the hospital was US$17.49 million. This included the cost of the
conciliation – US$1.5 million – for the MO.

11. ESEO monitored the works progress unsatisfactorily. After the PCU assumed the
managerial role, it was clear that the progress reported by ESEO was far less than stated. The
contract with the temporary joint venture was ended in November 2009.

12. Santa Gertrudis de San Vicente Hospital. This 139-bed hospital had 16,300 m2 and
was between three and 150 years old. The oldest parts were severely damaged. Given the
hospital’s characteristics (buildings were dispersed, and there was a lack of adequate functional
design), it was decided the hospital should be rebuilt on land adjacent to the original site.

13. The contract for the works was signed in January 2007 between the MOH and the
temporary association of COPRECA S.A.-PINEARQ S.L. The project was to be in two phases:
design would be four months and construction and equipment would be 14 months. Works

                                              28
started in February 2007 and were to be finished in 18 months (August 2008). The first
extension of the completion date was to November 2008. However, the hospital was not
completed by then and the contract ended in February 2009. Although ESEO had reported
progress of 88 percent by March 2009, the PCU new assessment found that the progress was
only 60 percent. The original value of the contract was US$14.20 million and the final cost was
US$22.9 million. This included the US$1.4 million needed to finish the works, after the
contract with the original construction firm was cancelled.

14. Monitoring of the works was based on a plan that had originally been given to the
construction company. However, ESEO did not monitor the progress satisfactorily. After the
contract with the construction company was cancelled, the PCU directly supervised the work,
under several contracts.

15. Hospital Nacional de Maternidad en San Salvador. This 302-bed hospital had 15,900
m2 and was between 20 and 50 years old. It suffered medium and severe damages to several
buildings. Given the location of the hospital in the heart of San Salvador, it was decided the
building should be relocated elsewhere. Though the hospital was not built under RHESSA, the
Project provided funds to carry out environmental studies and purchase equipment. The
amount allocated under the Project was US$2.2.

    16. Component II: Strengthening Essential Health and Nutrition Services in
    Earthquake-affected and Extremely Poor Areas. This component extended the coverage of
    essential health and nutrition services in the north, central and para-central areas. Coverage was
    extended through NGOs and MOH primary health care units. Institutions were strengthened.
    The component financed health services under two models, as defined by the MOH: The first
    contracted NGOs to provide basic health services; the second established institutional units,
    using the MOH infrastructure and organization, using management agreements. The activities
    were launched in 2005 and were completed by February 2009. Contracts for extending
    coverage were signed with the NGOs and with 77 mobile teams from public facilities
    contracted by the MOH. The Project allowed the MOH to learn from each of the modalities of
    coverage extension and opted to adopt the institutional units. The original 131 mobile teams
    (through NGO contracting) and MOH institutionalized extension teams were consolidated into
    380 Family Health Community Teams (Equipos Comunitarios de Salud Familiar – ECOs) plus
    28 ECOs with medical specialization. The experience of this Project set the foundation for the
    development of the Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC) that the MOH is now
    implementing, with financial and technical assistance of a World Bank Project8

    17. Subcomponent II.a: Expanding coverage of essential health and nutrition services
    in impoverished rural areas. This subcomponent focused on extending basic health services
    in 73 poorest and most underserved municipalities through contracts with NGOs. The NGOs
    were: Asociación Salvadoreña para la Salud Rural (ASAPROSAR), Fundación Salvadoreña

para la Salud y el Desarrollo Humano (FUSAL), Centro de Apoyo de la Lactancia Materna
(CALMA); Asociación para la Autodeterminación y Desarrollo de la Mujer Salvadoreña
(AMS); Fundación Salvadoreña para el Desarrollo de la Mujer y el Niño (FUNDEMUN) and
Fundación Seraphim de El Salvador. The main outputs were contracts with six NGOs in the
North of the country. Contracts were signed, and, the model was developed in two parts. The
first involved planning and health management at community level, which included a diagnosis
of the health situation, a definition of what were considered the priority health services and a
participatory evaluation of the services. The second involved the actual provision of services,
which included home visits to offer integrated health care to families and attention to each age
group. By completion, six NGOs had provided basic health services to around 250,000
beneficiaries in 58 municipalities and 292 cantons were reached.

18. The Project provided support to test the two different provision models (NGOs and
Government) and then institutionalize the strategy of extension of coverage of health services
to rural communities with elements of each of the options supported by the Project. It also
supported the program to reduce hospitals waiting lists, provide training, and buy medicines
and 14 motorcycles for the supervisors of the health promoters in the participating
municipalities.

19. The NGO model was initiated in May 2005, and then it had two more phases in
November 2006 and April 2007, when new contracts with NGOs were signed, to continue
implementing the strategy of extension of health services. The amount spent per capita (for
each beneficiary) was US$16 a year. This included 100 different types of health services
interventions. NGOs contracts included capitation transfers of US$2.6 per beneficiary. The
institutional mobile teams were having 1.6 contacts per year. By 2010, when all coverage
extension was conducted through institutional teams (ECOs), the average per capita contacts a
year by the mobile teams was 3.5. Each team had one doctor and two nurses for every 100,000
people. In each of the cantons or communities, there was a permanent health promoter for
every 1,000 people. The first evaluation was finished in July of 2008 and follow up evaluations
were finished in 2009 and 2010. Both were based on samples. The evaluation assessed the
benefits of the two models and also aimed to strengthen MOH’s capacity to evaluate the
provision of health services by third parties. MOH personnel were trained according to a plan
developed by consultants.

20. The Project supported the elaboration of a Manual for Extending Coverage which
was widely used by the teams working within both modes. The main health services
provided by the Rural Mobile Teams (Equipos Móviles Rurales – EMR) were:

    Integrated care to pregnant women before, during and after their pregnancies;
    Integrated care with regard to the health and nutrition of children under ten;
    Prevention and early diagnosis of cervical and breast cancer;
    Promotion of responsible parenting;
    Attention to the main causes of morbidity in the main population ;
    Promotion of good health practices at the family level and within the environment;
    Epidemiology surveillance and control at the family and community level;
    Strengthening of community organizations and fostering participation and social control.

                                             33
21. An integrated nutrition program for pregnant women and children under two was
launched in all the municipalities involved in the extended coverage. The Project helped
strengthen MOH’s institutional capacity by establishing a unit to manage the contracting of
health services with NGOs. It also helped decentralize the delivery of primary health care.

22. Subcomponent II.b: Strengthening MOH’s primary care delivery in earthquake-
affected areas. The Project financed investment in medicines, medical equipment and items
needed to improve transportation and supervision.

23. Under both sub-components, activities to strengthen M&E were conducted.
Supervision of activities to follow up the actual implementation of the two modalities of
extension of basic health services was carried out by the different levels of organization in the
different regions. One of the main outputs has been a set of guidelines for the mobile teams,
which seek to strengthen their activities. The NGOs prepared annual strategic plans for regions
and cantons, which outlined the health priorities and the main health activities.

24. Although El Salvador significantly reduced poverty from 1992-2005, there were still
families who were extremely poor and the numbers at national level were almost
unchanged from 2000-2005. Poverty was higher in rural areas and there was little progress in
reducing it. Thus, the Government introduced a social assistance program in March 2005 to
extremely poor families, by providing them with basic health and education services.

25. To address the poor health indicators and clients’ complaints, achieve equitable
access to care, and attain the Millennium Development Goals, the Government decided to
expand essential health services to the disadvantaged—especially mothers and children,
and rural and indigenous populations. To do so, the Ministry of Health (MOH) launched an
innovative approach to deliver services through two models of expanded coverage: (a) by
contracting out the provision of basic health services to private NGOs and (b) creating local
mobile health care teams within the MOH.

26. Component II focused on: (a) solidifying the provision of health services to remote and
poor areas; (b) expanding coverage; and (c) institutionalizing the program to assure its
sustainability and governance that, in turn, would improve health results. Given the emerging
financial crisis, which could affect the size and effectiveness of social budgets, the challenge is
to maintain this program and consolidate the improvements of the health indicators.

27. Although the goal of expanding coverage in the north had been developed before
2001, the MOH management capacity was weak and did not have a unified strategy to
supervise and monitor the services. Also, it lacked the ability to contract, monitor and
evaluate the work of the contractors, and to lead the sector with a national priority-based health
strategy. Previous programs, such as SALSA and ―Promotores‖, helped cover some of the
poor, but varied greatly in the quality of care, and the extent of the coverage. In addition, there
was little evidence that the programs represented a sustainable solution to the health disparities.

28. The Project supported various mechanisms to improve performance standards and
ensure that the goals to expand coverage would be met. The two provider modes had

                                               34
different incentives and tools to achieve similar goals. For their part, the NGOs signed legally-
binding contracts between the MOH and each mobile unit that specified the minimum
requirements to be fulfilled—such as services to be provided, geographic areas served, and
general guidelines for the health professional teams. Indicators were applied to gauge whether
the goals were met and the project objectives achieved. These included most critical child and
maternal health interventions and non-health performance measurements that could be
quantified to provide an easily implemented tool for M&E. To assess the progress of
Component II, the MOH and independent auditors reviewed the NGOs’ monthly reports and
mobile health team’s records.

   Rationale for      comparative advantages.
   using both         The public-private partnership enhanced competition.
   modes              It gave the MOH an incentive to develop its capacity for purchasing
                      and supervision at the same time.

29. The Project also reinforced compliance and enhanced MOH’s performance in
carrying out its activities. First, providers billed MOH for services rendered with and without
bonuses or sums withheld (the bonuses and withholdings depended on whether and to what
extent the goals were met). Second, fixed fee-for-service payments shifted partial risk from the
MOH onto the providers. Discretion regarding the use of funds created incentives to achieve
higher performance standards and provide more innovative, cost-effective services. At the
same time, the requirement that providers be accountable for fulfilling minimum requirements
assured that the quality of services and the responsiveness to beneficiaries were not
compromised.

30. For the MOH units, the performance contracts did not carry the same kind of legal
responsibility. However, they included the same indicators and performance guidelines as the
NGO contracts and were monitored monthly to assure compliance. The performance indicators
were measured in the same manner as those for the NGO teams.

31. Through the Project financing the expanded coverage, the MOH increased access to
care and the beneficiaries’ health status improved. Over 1,234,081 people 75% of whom
live in extreme poverty, gained access to basic health services in 104 municipalities and 591
cantons. Contracts for expanding coverage (both through the NGOs and Ministry) were signed
with 77 mobile teams; over US$8.4 million was invested in medical supplies and medications,
equipment, and staff training. Each NGO team made an average of seven visits a month per
community, and the Ministry’s mobile teams averaged over two visits per canton. As a result
of this increased coverage, 95.3% of children are now immunized with the six most essential
vaccines, and 95.5% receive a check-up before they are 28 days old. Most pregnant women
(79.6%) now receive at least five pre-natal checkups to ensure better health for themselves and
their fetuses. Thus, most health objectives were not only fulfilled but surpassed.

32. As coverage expands, the positive incremental advances will also increase. For
example, coverage for newborns and children under one year rose dramatically: (a) 100% of
the children in the targeted areas are now enrolled in the program; (b) over 70% were enrolled
before they were 28 days old; (b) 99.2% received complete vaccinations and 97.8% received at
least one form of medical attention.

                                             36
33. Some improvements were also made in child nutrition and weight control: 99.5% of
children were evaluated for those indicators. Malnutrition (moderate or severe) dropped to
15.2%. Infant mortality rates also improved: In areas served by NGOs, there were 16.1 deaths
per 1,000 births and in those served by the MOH teams, there were 13.3 deaths per 1,000.
These data represent a significant improvement from the 22 per 1,000 reported by UNICEF in
2006 and are lower than the 17 per 1,000 births in the Millennium Development Goal for 2015.
Mortality rates from diarrhea and respiratory infections fell to zero (in NGO-served areas) and
2.02 per 1,000 persons (served by the MOH units).

34. Women’s health: Increased coverage reduced the proportion of unattended births
by 25%. At the end of 2008, 86.3% of births were attended by qualified professionals. Some
increases were also noted in the percent of women who had an adequate number of prenatal
visits: 52% of those who subscribed early in their pregnancies complied with the five or more
visits requirement (79.6% by project completion). Postnatal visits increased considerably to
89% of women registered. Also, no cases were recorded of childbirth deaths. Further, the
percent of women who received regular Pap smear tests for early detection of cervical cancer
increased to 79% and 90% in the NGO and MOH areas, respectively.

35. The institutionalization of Component II was critical in order to assure that the
program would be a permanent fixture in the country’s health system and continue
regardless of political or administration changes. The Ministerial Accord No. 1000 made
expanded coverage a legal reality, while the creation of the unit within the MOH made it
operational. The Ministry secured the finances to sustain the expansion and ensure that recent
health gains would be maintained. Currently, the Government is incorporating the provision of
services to remote groups into the public health system and developing an effective
surveillance and information system to strengthen its management of the decentralized health
units.

36. Subcomponent II.c: Strengthening MOH capacity to plan coverage extension, to
manage contracts and performance agreements, and to monitor and evaluate
performance. The main outputs were the following:
   The close collaboration between the Project and key units within the MOH: Dirección
     General de Salud y Aseguramiento de la Calidad, Dirección General de Planificación,
     the Regional Health Services and the SIBASI’s;
   Adoption of processes and information in the MOH and the health system, including all
     key actors;
   Development of the operations manual for extending health services;
   Development of two manuals: one on social participation and another on social audits;
   Guidelines for the referral system;
   Guidelines for extending health services;
   Review of norms and regulations for protocols establishing national health priorities and
     defining the basic health and nutrition services within the context of extending such
     services.

 37. Component III: MOH institutional development for formulating policy, national
 priority programs and support programs. This Component aimed to strengthen MOH’s
 institutional capacity to manage functions related to improving quality of care, health
 promotion, public health programs, disease surveillance, regulations and performance-based
 M&E. It proposed an incentive to achieve this by linking the resources to financial investments
 in areas involved with adopting institutional strengthening and decentralization strategies. This
 Component achieved its targets.

 38. Subcomponent III.a: Institutional Modernization. This subcomponent provided
 technical assistance (TA) and training, financed studies and study tours to strengthen MOH’s
 capacity to set and implement policies, and monitors the achievement of targets. The main
 outputs were:
    Publishing the ―Proposal for the Functions and Organization of the national health system
      by the National Commission of Monitoring of the Proposal for the Integrated Reform of
      the Health System (CNSPRIS in Spanish);
    Workshops and consultants to support the development of the above document;
    Publishing the Law establishing the national health system;
    Publishing the Norms expressed in the law;
    Publishing a Strategic document on national health policy (Ley del Sistema Nacional de
      Salud);
    Defining the ―Modelo de Atención Integral‖, with a focus on family health;
    Developing and implementing a national program for preventing non-transmissible
      chronic diseases.

 39.   Sub-component III.b: Investments to strengthen MOH national priority programs

 Environmental Health: The Project helped strengthen the MOH department in charge of
 environmental health (Gerencia de Atención Integral de Salud Ambiental – GAISA). Under
 this activity the Project achieved the following:
    Acquired 10,700 latrines;
    Acquired 85 structures (casetas) and 98 pieces of equipment to purify water;
    Upgraded the drainage system of the National Hospital Rosales, in an urban area;
    Reviewed key norms and regulations related to latrines, water quality, bottled water, an
       operations manual for food used by environmental health inspectors;
    Held workshops at hospitals to develop environmental assessments, diagnoses and
       environmental impact studies;
    Held workshops for environmental inspectors to train them on applying environmental
       norms.

Management and Disposal of Hospital Medical Waste: The Project financed the following:
   Equipment and supplies for managing and safely disposing of hospital waste for 30
     national hospitals and all of the primary health care units;
   Training personnel in hospitals and Primary Health Care Units to use the inputs to
     manage medical waste and the facilities to dispose of it;
   Constructing facilities for temporary disposal of medical waste in 16 national hospitals;

                                               38
      Providing security locations (celdas de seguridad) for managing and disposal medical
       waste in the occidental, oriental and para-central health regions;
      Developing materials to train personnel in environmental health in hospitals and
       conducting the training.
      Materials were provided for 2 national hospitals and five health units, and surpassed
       targets to construct collection and storage sites: 16 temporary collection sites were built
       (2 were planned), as were 122 disposal sites.

Activities to strengthen the national laboratories:
    Acquiring a large truck to transport vaccines;
    Acquiring vaccines and equipment to transport them, and increasing the capacity to
        obtain information from testing and monitoring;
    Strengthening the “Unidad de Vigilancia de Laboratorios ―within the MOH by acquiring
        laboratory equipment for the main central laboratory and the national network of
        laboratories; acquiring computers, office equipment , air conditioning, bio security
        materials; training laboratory personnel;
    Hiring temporary staff to conduct studies requested by MOH.

 40. Subcomponent III.c: Investments to strengthen MOH support systems. This activity
 achieved its targets and helped reduce the incidence of dengue across the country. The Project
 helped strengthen the MOH unit in charge of tracking these diseases (Unidad de Vigilancia de
 Enfermedades Vectorizadas). The Project improved the administrative and logistical capacity
 at central, regional and community levels (at the SIBASIs). The Project provided (a) resources
 for logistical/administrative activities at MOH central, regional and local levels; (b)
 surveillance vehicles; (c) equipment for the malaria/dengue programs, and the Department of
 Epidemiology Surveillance; (d) technical guides for field teams; (e) computers and other
 equipment to the SIBASIS and central level; (e) training and other activities on prevention.
 From 2005-2008, the following outputs included:

      Providing vehicles to the mobile teams (78 motorcycles and 9 pick- up trucks);
      Acquiring 14 microscopes for the malaria program;
      Training voluntary personnel working on the malaria program and acquiring equipment
       (lamps and umbrellas) to support their activities in areas with endemic malaria;
      Providing basic equipment (backpacks, hats, clothing) for field work to the personnel and
       inspectors involved with the dengue and malaria programs;
      Acquiring 108 pieces of equipment (equipos termonebulizadores) to fumigate;
      Providing 1,500 technical field guides to staff in the malaria and dengue programs;
      Acquiring and distributing books and other written materials on dengue cases to national
       hospitals, health units, clinics of the social security institute (ISSS) and other health
       institutions;
      Strengthening the Red de Vigilancia Entomológica by acquiring computer systems for 17
       SIBASIs, five regions and the surveillance unit at the central level;
      Acquiring equipment for bio-security.




                                               39
The logistical aspects were strengthened by:
    Hiring field operators for heavy equipment used during the national prevention
       campaigns from 2005-2007;
    Training staff (125 doctors at national level), to foster inter-institutional cooperation for
       prevention and controlling dengue and malaria;
    Workshops to train personnel in the use and maintenance of portable fumigation
       equipment at national level;
    Review and validate the regulations for bio-security in 2005;
    Develop an education strategy to foster dengue control, to be implemented in schools;
    Evaluating the national malaria and dengue program (2005 and 2006).

Prevention and control of HIV/AIDS and STIs:
    Financing a consultant to provide TA to strengthen the HIV/AIDS/STI national
       prevention strategy with regard to those in jail, so as to control the transmission of the
       disease;
    Strengthening CONSIDA;
    HIV/AIDS/STI national prevention strategy with regard to migrating populations and
       those on the country’s borders;
    National prevention strategy with regard to pregnant mothers infected with the disease;
    Prevention campaigns on TV and radio;
    Publishing and disseminating educational materials at the community level;
    Providing equipment to the national hospitals for the HIV/AIDS wards, such as air
       conditioning ,dental chairs and furniture;
    Providing air conditioning, computers and furniture at the central level of MOH;
    Acquiring equipment for 13 dental units at the national level (unidades odontológicas);
    Acquiring reagents for conducting tests at national laboratories.

The PCU monitored HIV in pregnant women, which dropped from 0.22% to 0.08%, partly due
to GFATM activities and funding The Project educated prisoners, migrants, dentists and
pregnant women about HIV/AIDS prevention, financed training/equipment, and treatment in
national hospitals.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.    The PAD included a cost-benefit analysis of the Project for three of the components.
An ex-post economic analysis was not carried out at the time of the ICR. Nevertheless the
impact of the Project on achieving economic benefits can be inferred from the assumptions
included in the PAD. Economic benefits were expected from the Project’s interventions thanks
to the reduction on the length of stays in hospitals and the achievement of greater efficiency by
strengthening the hospital management in the rehabilitated hospitals. While there was not
enough time to gather data on the hospital length of stay and the initial values for length of
stays were already low, the Project contributed to the strengthening of management at the
hospitals benefited by the Project. By Project completion all hospitals benefited by the Project
had access to the integrated system to treat patients. This included modules on different areas
(patient information, pharmacy, lab, etc). It is reasonable to assume that this development will
generate direct economic benefits in the future.

2.    Other project interventions were expected to contribute to the achievement of
economic benefits due to the local satisfaction of patients’ needs, reduction in mortality
and morbidity in the most vulnerable population. Direct benefits are likely thanks to the
strengthening of the primary health network by Project completion. The local resolution of
health problems might have contributed to the reduction of the need for hospitalizations the
areas tackled by the Project. The interventions under Component II, having achieved and
sustained an extension of coverage of vulnerable population and provided access to critical
health services, have provided benefits through the improvements in the health conditions of
the population and a reduction of the need for hospitalization. Even in the few years of the
program, as a result of increased access to and utilization of healthcare, important advances in
health indicators were accomplished.

3.    Vaccination rates increased from a low of 75 percent in 2006 to covering 95.3
percent of children under one year in the participating regions. Prevalence of diarrhea
dropped from 17 to 14 percent prevalence and deaths from this disease fell to 0 per 1000
population. Important reductions were also accomplished in controlling respiratory infections
and diminishing its factor as a cause of deaths to 2.02 per 1000 population. Important advances
were made in nutritional care, with the number of children subscribed for a nutritional
coverage program increasing from 74 to 97 percent of all children and at least 99.5 percent of
children having been evaluated for height/weight indicators. As a result, malnutrition
(moderate or severe) dropped to 15.2 percent of children in NGO and 12 percent in the IU
beneficiary populations.

4.    Long-term improvements, as measured by infant mortality, were accomplished in
child health as a result of the above-mentioned health improvements. The country as a
whole has experienced small but steady reductions in child mortality rates, from 14.2 in 2004
to the recently stabilizing number of 13.4 per 1,000 live births. For the municipalities
participating in the program, where the child mortality rates were much higher than the
national averages, the drop has been even more notable, coming down from a high of 22 in
2006 to lows of 14 per 1000 live births (16.1 in the NGO and 13.3 IU modality) in 2008. This
reduction is even more significant given that the predicted target level by the MDG for 2015

                                              41
was 17 per 1000 live births. In children under five years, mortality has gone down
substantially in the institutional regions (6.7 per 1000 live births), but not as much in the NGO
units (20.1 per live births).

5.    Despite the fact that advances in women’s maternal mortality rates are difficult to
measure and quantify, the increased pre/during/post pregnancy care was expected to
contribute in the significant decrease of mortality during childbirth. In fact, there were no
cases of mortality recorded during the period of the program. While this could signify failure to
register deaths, important improvements were also observed nation-wide, with the rates falling
from 59 per 100,000 to 50 per 100,000 live births.

6.     The main downside to the efficient use of resources under the Project comes from
the problems encountered in the construction of the hospitals. This is the case for the
hospitals of Zacatecoluca, Usulután and San Vicente. In the case of these three hospitals the
financial resources used until July 2009 did not match the physical achievements up to that
time. This was one factor explaining an inefficient use of resources to achieve the result of
completing construction on time and within budget. In addition, it is also certain that the cost
of the hospitals at the design state was underestimated (which has been previously discussed).
At the end of the Project implementation, civil works for the six hospitals ended up costing 37
percent more than what was originally budgeted for the seven hospitals. Five of the six
hospitals required an additional 12 to 27 months to complete civil works. Civil works that lag
construction have implications in terms of inefficiencies in the use of resources. Moreover, the
MOH was subject to five lawsuits stemming from contract disputes with construction firms. As
a result, the GOES had to pay US$9.73 million in arbitration and settlement fees. While this
additional amount is not directly related to the cost of civil works, it represents a significant
inefficient use of resources for the Government. Moreover, the PCU had to invest an
enormous amount of time and effort to deal with these issues. However, legal action taken by
the PCU against the poor performing firms resulted in the recovery of over US$2 million of
contract guarantees.

7.    An additional inefficiency of the Project in the use of resources was the ESEO. The
ESEO’s contract lasted three years (2006-2008) and cost nearly US$10 million. Had the
ESEO’s performance been adequate, this would not have been an issue. However, the fact is
the ESEO had an exceptionally poor performance, yielding very little benefit to the Project.
While there were attempts to put in place corrective measures this could not be achieved. The
main challenge was the type of contract used to hire the firm, which lacked incentives for
ESEO to push the construction firms for results, timely compliance with the milestones, and
adhering to their schedule, since payment was not contingent on any progress. The ESEO
continued to receive payment for as long as construction work was ongoing. Unfortunately the
ESEO’s poor performance could not be considered a breach of contract, based on the terms of
reference. On the other hand, despite Bank’s suggestion to not renew ESEO’s contracts, GOES
continue renewing its contract until the audits (recommended by the Bank) found the
overestimation of the physical progress reported by the ESEO to the PCU

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

1.    A workshop was carried out in 2008 to share the results of the Red Solidaria
evaluation to assess the performance of the NGOs and institutional mobile teams. Key
stakeholders from the SIBASI’s, NGOs staff and personnel from the central level of the MOH
participated in the workshop. The participants, who gathered by regions, identified the main
challenges to be addressed. These were: (i) inadequacy of the information system to serve as a
decision making tool; (ii) need to improve the recording of the activities carried out under both
modalities of provision of services; (iii) lack of good communication between the MOH and
the NGOs; (iv) need to improve the supervision and evaluation; and (v) inadequate information
on the real cost of the service provision. This exercise served the purpose of addressing these
challenges until the completion of the Project.

2.    The 2008 evaluation and the final report on the extension of coverage activities
captured the degree of satisfaction among beneficiaries of the extension of coverage.
They showed that the RHESSA project has achieved a high level of satisfaction among
beneficiaries for both modalities of extension of coverage. Between 98.4 percent and 100
percent of beneficiaries considered the utilization of services as valuable for improving the
health status of their communities. The beneficiaries expressed a high degree of satisfaction
(80% or higher) regarding the overall program, the frequency of the visits by the teams, the
respect to the schedule of visits, the hours, the adequacy of the place to provide the service and
the information provided to them, among other areas. Close to 98 percent also indicated an
adequate supply of medicines available by the units and between 95.5 percent and 97.6 percent
of beneficiaries indicated that their health needs were met by the extension coverage teams.
Beneficiaries expressed a lower degree of satisfaction with regard to the waiting times and the
number of health staff to provide the services. For both modalities, the net index of satisfaction
was close to 80 percent.

Annex 10. Detailed Project Implementation Summary

 December 2001-September 2003

 1.    Project approval by the National Assembly was not smooth. After it was approved
 by the Executive Board of the Bank in December 2001, several aspects of the Project were
 questioned by different factions in the National Assembly. The Bank team invested a lot of
 time and effort to explain the rationale behind the activities included in each component. The
 main areas of concern were the potential for privatization of health services (through the use
 of NGOs to deliver health services), the deepening of the decentralization efforts (through the
 SIBASIs) and the reluctance to define and agree on a basic package of health services. The
 Bank team worked with all the stakeholders (elected politicians, NGOs, and the Association
 of Medical Professionals) to address questions, help them better understand the Project’s
 content and objectives, and to gather support. The National Assembly finally approved it in
 June 2003.

 2.    There were substantial preparations in 2003 for implementation before
 effectiveness – before the National Assembly formally approved it and Project effectiveness
 (September 2003) – carried out by the Bank and Borrower’s teams, the PCU finalized the
 Operations Manual. The national team worked to better define and adapt the PAD’s content
 and design to reflect the changes that had occurred in the health sector since the Bank
 approved the Project.

 3.    In 2003, activities in the Project components were adjusted. The PAD had been
 designed in an emergency situation (in fact, re-designed to include a new component -
 Component I - to an already designed project), facing long delays to become effective. At the
 time of effectiveness, there were emergency conditions in the infrastructure and hospital
 functions, and changes in the health sector that affected Project implementation (see section
 2.2). This review (which involved ongoing dialogue in 2003) did not change the Project’s
 development objectives or overall components, but it adjusted certain aspects of the
 components.

 4.     The main adjustments were: (1) adding hospital management sub-projects, in the
 context of the hospital infrastructure reconstruction, and improvements in information
 technology (IT) and human resources (in Component III, connecting Components I and III );
 (2) updating the extent and cost of the activities to extend health coverage under Component
 II; (3) reviewing the activities in Component III on HIV/AIDs to coordinate with the Global
 Fund activities; (4) reviewing the decentralization model under the SIBASIs in the context of
 improving MOH’s planning capacity; and (5) reviewing and changing the model for
 managing and supervising the hospital construction and equipment contracts in Component I.
 The original implementation arrangements in the PAD anticipated creating two
 implementation units: (1) the Infrastructure Executing Unit (IEU) in charge of Component I,
 reporting directly to MOH; and (2) the PCU, in charge of all other components. This
 arrangement gave civil works implementation to a construction management firm (CMF).



                                             51
The IEU would represent the MOH in the construction management agreements to be signed
with construction firms.

5.    In 2003, under pressure from the Assembly to reduce the amounts allocated to
consultants, the Borrower and Bank decided against hiring a CMF and opted for a
Works Supervision Firm (Empresa Supervisora de Estudios y Obras - ESEO ), while the
management of Component I was to fall under the PCU. The actual contracting (preparing
bidding documents, evaluating bids, etc) was conducted by the PCU, collaborating with the
MOH technical unit. While this allowed for building capacity within the MOH, it also meant
delays during implementation, as described below.

6.     The Bank management waived some of the effectiveness conditions. This was done
mainly to complete the preliminary designs and environmental impact of two hospitals - once
the Project was approved by the National Assembly in June 2003. While the MOH made
progress carrying out activities to fulfill the effectiveness conditions, it faced financial
restrictions to initiate implementation, since finances were not approved for the Project
within the national budget.

7.    The Ministry of Finance got the National Assembly to approve the Project in the
national budget. This was essential to comply with the financial effectiveness conditions (ie.
to create a revolving fund and special account-SA). By September 2003, the special account
was established and $0.5 million was transferred to it. The Project became effective in
September 2003. In October 2003, the Borrower made its first withdrawal.

September 2003 - March 2005

8.    Project implementation lagged during 2004. While the total budget for
implementation in 2003 was US$1.2 million, only US$0.5 million was actually used. This
was due to several factors: (1) Delays in approving the budget for implementation and
insufficient budget allocated to the budget by the Ministry of Finance (MOF. In the first
months of 2004, the Project budget was insufficient. Although the MOH requested US$7.7
million, by March 2004 it was still not approved. At the time, the amount available was only
US$0.7 million. However, the budget was eventually approved. Out of a program of US$7.7
million, US$2.8 million was used, of which about US$0.8 million was for administrative
costs; (2) The administration changed in the second half of 2004. This meant working with
the incoming administration to make the Project activities consistent with the new
government’s views for the sector. This involved renewing staff within the PCU, which
occurred slowly. As a result, little progress was made on launching implementation of all
Project Components during 2004. Nevertheless, the Bank management decided to move
forward and not cancel the Project in 2004. The new administration expressed its
commitment to the PDO. In practice, this project began implementing in 2005.

9.    Implementation of Component I experienced even longer delays. These were in the
areas of hospital design and contract to prepare the construction and functional plans. The
PCU had to assess the demand for services, in order to prepare these plans. Given the lag
between design and implementation, it was necessary to reassess the demand for each

                                           52
hospital in each SIBASI, updating the analysis done during preparation. The new analysis
helped to better define specific construction and operational criteria and revise the cost per
hospital. At this point, given the changes in quality criteria, there was some indication that
costs of civil works were going to be higher than anticipated.

10. A new administration took office in June 2004. In a context of good dialogue with
the Bank, progress was made with respect to moving implementation forward, from June
2004 until March 2005. Under the new administration, the MOH (the PCU and the MOH
Planning Unit) advanced in the preparatory activities to implement Component I. An
agreement was reached to tackle the reconstruction efforts in two phases: San Rafael,
Cojutepeque and Usulután would be in the first phase and San Vicente, San Miguel,
Zacatecoluca and Maternidad of San Salvador would be in the second. The civil works were
to be contracted under the modality of ―Turnkey‖ (―Llave en mano? in Spanish). There was
agreement to hire the works supervision firm (ESEO)to monitor the hospital construction in
the first phase. Work to prepare the terms of reference was undertaken at this time.

March 2005 - End of 2007

11. In May 2005, the implementation arrangements were changed. The PCU was
reorganized and the position of general coordinator (for the PCU) was closed. The PCU was
divided into two coordination units: The Hospital Rehabilitation Coordination Unit (UCRH)
and the Coordination Unit for Components II, III and IV were formally separated. PCU staff
was reinforced with technical personnel from the MOH. The PCU was given more
implementation responsibilities (thus helping to reduce the administrative bottlenecks at the
end of 2004 and beginning of 2005). A new position of commissioner was created to follow
up the implementation of Component I, who was to coordinate with the UCRH, which
remained in charge of implementation. The Operations Manual was modified to reflect these
organizational changes.

12. Actual implementation of the Project’s activities started in 2005. During 2005,
there was a great deal of Bank support to launch implementation. With regard to Component
II, the first contracts were signed during the first quarter with five NGOS in three SIBASIS,
as were agreements with six health teams in two SIBASIs to implement it. The provision of
health services started in mid-2005. In August, the second phase of extending coverage was
underway. Regarding Component III, implementation was lagging due to lack of capacity at
the PCU. The PCU was technically strengthened with staff from the MOH and by the end of
2005, implementation improved significantly. Regarding Component I, substantial work was
needed to start the bidding process for the first three hospitals in 2005, to prepare to launch
the next three in 2006, and to prepare the contract to hire the ESEO. The PCU intended to
begin constructing the first three hospitals as soon as possible. Under these conditions, they
were prepared as turnkey projects (―Llave en mano?): Usulután, Cojutepeque and San
Rafael.

13. The procurement process for the hospitals was challenging for the MOH and the
PCU from the beginning. The procurement process for Usulután hospital was launched in
September 2005, but offers were rejected and it had to be re-bid. Construction actually

                                            53
started in July 2007. The procurement process for Cojutepeque and San Rafael hospitals was
to be launched in the second half of 2005, with contracts to be awarded in the first quarter of
2006. However, plans were delayed and construction finally started later in 2006. The ESEO
was hired during the first quarter of 2006, with the first contract approved for March 2006-
January 2008. The plan was to launch the second phase hospitals from March-May 2006.
But, this was delayed as well.

14. Between 2005 and 2006, during the initial procurement process for civil works,
the PCU realized the cost of hospital works had been significantly underestimated and
needed to be revised. This increase (see section 2.2 for description) raised the possibility
that there would not be enough loan resources to rebuild all seven hospitals as originally
envisioned. At the time, the Maternity Hospital was the only one for which no land had been
identified (much less purchased). Therefore, the GOES and the Bank decided that the loan
would finance all the pre-investment plans for the Maternity Hospital but not the construction
itself. The MOH agreed to finance its construction with funds from other sources. This
change was not formally requested by the GOES until August 2009, through a letter from the
Minister of Finance. However this was never formalized in the Legal Agreement or the
project indicators.

15. During 2006, steady progress was made in all the projects components. The mid-
term review was carried out in March 2007 and reflected the implementation progress in all
components during 2005 and 2006.

16. Early in 2007, difficulties in the implementation of Component I occurred. The
hospitals of the first phase under construction – Cojutepeque and San Rafael - were
experiencing delays. The Bank, MOH and the PCU all concentrated on strengthening
supervision in an effort to move implementation forward. The problems related to the
contractors: The consortia executing the works filed claims against the MOH for the change
in costs as a result of modifications in the designs introduced by the ESEO (see section 2.2).
In the case of Cojutepeque, the firm still continued with the works; in the case of San Rafael,
the firm asked for economic compensation and construction barely progressed. Both cases
went to arbitration. In 2007, the other four hospitals were bid and construction started. The
Bank assigned a consultant in-situ to help strengthen supervision. Cojutepeque Hospital was
inaugurated in December 2007.

17. Further changes in the PCU occurred in June 2007, to support Project
implementation. Emphasis was placed on supervising hospital works and more staff were
enrolled to better monitor implementation. MOH staff who provided support during the pre-
investment phase returned to the MOH, except for an engineer and an environmental
specialist.

January 2008 – June 2009

18. During 2008, the works of two hospitals were completed while the progress of
other works fell behind schedule. Cojutepeque Hospital was finished in December 2007
and started operating in January 2008. San Rafael Hospital was to be completely finished in

                                            54
early 2008 but wasn’t until February 2009 (due to arbitration). San Vicente Hospital
progressed at an acceptable pace, though with delays. Usulután and Zacatecoluca hospitals
experienced substantial delays, although they were moving forward. San Miguel hospital -
the last one to be bid - was progressing well at the time The Maternity Hospital was still
included in the Project’s operating plan and on-going appraisal studies were financed. The
MOH received confirmation from the Ministry of Finance (MOF) that it would assign the
needed counterpart funding to complete either its construction or rehabilitation. In this
context, the Borrower and Bank considered extending the closing date, to achieve the PDOs.

19. The division of responsibilities between the ESEO and PCU was not working
properly and efforts to clarify them lagged. From mid-2007, it was apparent the
arrangement was not functioning well; the ESEO was more bureaucratic than expected, and
there were no clear incentives for the company to seriously tackle implementation. Before
extending the contract beyond April 2008, negotiations were held to include results-based
payments, in an effort to improve ESEO’s performance. However, this was never achieved.
The closing date for the ESEO contract was finally extended to October 2008. From April-
October 2008, ESEO was more effective and the working relationship with the PCU
improved.

20. Additional changes to the implementing arrangements occurred from July 2007-
December 2008. An executive directorship was created with four coordinators, one for each
component and one for financial management. Component I had two coordinators, which
assigned the hospitals into two groups.

June 2009 - June 2011

21. A new administration took office in June 2009. It was committed to completing the
Project and achievement of the PDOs. Responding to a request from the incoming
government, the Project was extended initially until October 2010 and later to June 2011.
During the final implementation phase, Components II and III were completed and the
Borrower concentrated on mainstreaming the achievements under each component into
MOH’s regular operations (see sections 2.5 and 4). The new administration conducted an
audit of Component I to assess the physical and financial progress of each hospital.

22. All implementation efforts focused on completing the works and equipping the
remaining hospitals. The new coordinator of Component I was key to improving and
sustaining the pace of implementation. San Miguel hospital, on which work began in March
2008 and was schedule to finish in October 2009, was completed in November 2010; San
Vicente, which started in June 2007 and was scheduled to finish in August 2008, was
finalized in November 2010. The hospitals in Zacatecoluca and Usulután were finished by
Project completion.

Changes in the cost of hospital works

23. The final cost of hospital construction/rehabilitation was much higher than
estimated in the PAD. Several factors explain the increase: (1) the costs were

                                         55
underestimated at the time of preparation, due to the speed at which Component I was
prepared after the earthquakes, so as to be included in the Project that was already well
advanced in the preparation cycle; (2) from the time of project preparation (2001-2002) and
the start of the bidding process (2005), the cost of materials rose, as well as the price of oil
and steel; (3) by 2005 and as a result of the devastating earthquakes, new seismic norms were
introduced, which further raised hospital construction costs; (4) the Between 2005 and 2006,
during the initial procurement process for civil works, the PCU realized the cost of hospital
works had been significantly underestimated and concluded that there were only enough
resources to build six of the seven hospitals originally envisioned. At the time, the Maternity
Hospital was the only one for which no land had been identified. Therefore, in order to
achieve the PDOs in a timely manner, the GOES and the Bank decided that the loan would
finance all the pre-investment plans for the Maternity Hospital but not the construction itself.
The MOH agreed to finance its construction with funds from other sources. This change was
not formally requested by the GOES until August 2009, through a letter from the Minister of
Finance. However this was never formalized in the Legal Agreement or the project
indicators.

24. Amendments to the Loan Agreement: The Loan Agreement was amended to extend
the original closing date of April 30, 2007. There were also five requests to reallocate loan
proceeds among categories. The first amendment, in September 2003, reflected the results of
negotiations between the GOES and the National Assembly. The second amendment, in
March 2006, reflected a reallocation of proceeds. The third amendment, in April 2007,
extended the Project closing date by 18 months to October 31, 2008 so as to give the Project
enough time to implement the agreed activities and achieve its PDOs. At the time, the Bank
team decided the extension was justified and a satisfactory procurement plan from January to
December 2007 was presented. The fourth amendment, in February 2008, involved a third
reallocation of proceeds. The Fifth Amendment, in October 2008, extended the closing date
to October 31, 2009. The sixth amendment, in October 2009, both extended the closing date
to March 30, 2010 and granted a reallocation of proceeds. The seventh amendment extended
the closing date to October 31, 2010 and an eighth one, in October 2010, extended it to June
30, 2011. The ninth and last amendment granted a reallocation of proceeds in May 2011. The
reason for the last extension was to assure that the PDOs were met by Project completion.

25.    Due to delays in constructing four of the hospitals (Usulután, Zacatecoluca, San
Miguel and San Vicente), the PDOs were not achieved by the planned closing date. The
GOES needed additional time to ensure there were enough budget resources to complete the
last activities related to Component I given the financial crisis and strains on the budget.
Under the ninth amendment, US$9.4 million was reallocated among different Project
activities (as a result of the decision not to construct the Maternity Hospital): This included
US$2.5 million to San Miguel hospital works, US$0.3 million to San Rafael hospital, US$5
million to San Vicente hospital, US$0.6 million to buy medicines to treat patients with the
AH1N1 Avian flu, US$0.5 million for operating expenditures and US$0.5 million for pre-
investment studies for the Maternity Hospital.

26. Monitoring of Component I was weak throughout implementation. The firm hired
to supervise the hospital construction (ESEO) was responsible for monitoring and reporting
progress to the PCU. However, ESEO’s limited capacity to monitor progress resulted in a
gross over-estimate of progress and an inaccurate perception that the component was being
implemented according to schedule. While ESEO official reports on physical progress were
consistent with financial execution, they substantially overstated the actual physical progress.
ESEO was relying on information from the construction firms, which were misrepresenting
the real status; and, ESEO was unable to detect the inconsistencies in a timely fashion.
According to the Bank’s recommendation, a technical audit was conducted which found that
the ESEO had reported to the PCU a substantially higher physical progress in the hospital
works, than had actually taken place. Thus, ESEO’s contract was not renewed (it ended in
2009). During the last period of implementation (January 2009 to June 2011), the PCU
monitoring of the progress of Component I was intense and concentrated on meeting
deadlines in order to achieve the PDOs. In addition, the choice of some indicators for
measuring impact of Component I was not adequate. The hospital average length of stay (4
days) for example was already considered low at the time of design. On the other hand, the
indicator of user satisfaction for hospitals could not be measured due to the completion of
four of the hospitals shortly before closing. Moreover, hospitals were not regularly
monitoring user satisfaction, and a survey was not specifically considered or carried out.

27. Monitoring and evaluation of Component II was regularly carried out, once the
initial obstacle of the baseline was overcome. The original Project baseline study for
Component II indicators was completed around 2006 (though activities of extension of health
coverage had started in 2005) and ultimately had to be discarded since it lacked technical
quality. Fortunately, MOH identified an alternative and used the monitoring tool developed
by Red Solidaria, a social program established to help families in extreme poverty which was
implemented in the same geographical areas covered by the Project. Nevertheless, the first
monitoring report of Red Solidaria was only available in 2007. Data from this initial report
was used as a baseline for most of the Project indicators. Though this alternative was
considered to be the best solution given the circumstances, the main problem was the data did
not represent the actual values prior to project implementation. In many cases, the values
obtain were most likely higher than estimated during Project preparation and therefore some

                                            57
of the targets established in the PAD were no longer realistic. This situation made it
challenging to assess whether target had been reached. It was possible however to assess
progress made from 2007, using Red Solidaria’s updated evaluation in November 2010. One
of the main challenges of the Project’s M&E framework has been the fact that it was never
formally revised to reflect the new baseline data of 2007 and the slight changes in indicators
when Red Solidaria’s tool was adopted. Therefore several of the original indicators as they
remained in the M&E Framework are not possible to asses.

28. The Government designed and validated the proposal for an integrated
management information system before Project completion. The Project financed a
Health Information Unit within the MOH which monitors basic health services and it also
helped the establishment of a unit for M&E of a dozen priority programs.

Disputes of civil work contracts

29. The adoption of national mechanisms to settle disputes should be promoted but
with a realistic assessment of timeframe needed. Bank standard contracts establish that
arbitration proceedings shall be conducted according to the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) procedures. Applying the national arbitration law to
the disputes in five of the six civil works contracts determined the Government paid US$9.73
million.

Extensions of Project closing dates

30. In 2009 and particularly 2010, there were lengthy discussions about closing the
Project. The last three extensions, which occurred between 2009 and 2010, were all carefully
considered. The Bank team and senior management extensively discussed the implications of
cancelling an operation that had already disbursed much of its funds but still had four
hospitals unfinished. Considering the Government’s severe financial constraints, the Bank
considered that withdrawing financing and technical support would have had severe adverse
effects on the country and to its relationship with the Bank. Under senior management
guidance, the Bank team processed each of the last three extensions under strict conditions,
which the client met.
