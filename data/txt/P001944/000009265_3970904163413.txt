PREFACE
1.       Credit 612-NIR for the Niger Third Highway Project for US$15.6
million was signed on March 5, 1976 and was made effective on January 31,
1977. The closing date was extended by three years to June 30, 1983.
The credit was fully disbursed except for about US$640,000 which will be
cancelled.
2.       This report was prepared by the West Africa Region Projects
Department from reviews of the project files, correspondence with the
borrower and the transcripts of discussions at negotiations and Board
Presentation, and information gathered during missions in connection with
other projects. The borrower assisted in preparation of the report by
providing traffic count data used in the economic re-evaluation.
3.       In accordance with the revised procedures for project perform-
ance audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the
Operations Evaluation Department COED) but the project was not audited by
OED staff. The draft report was sent to the Borrower and to the two co-
financing organizations who had no comments to add (Annex).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT - Cr. 612
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       The project consisted of:
. .               (a)   Implementation of a four-year program of periodic
maintenance, including procurement of equipment and
training of specialized PDW staff at all levels;
(b)   Construction and improvement of the roads Zinder-Nigerian
border (about 113 km), and Marudi-Nigerian border
(Djibiya) (about 49 km) and
(C)   Consulting services for:
Xi) technical assistance required under item (a)
above;
(ii) supervision of road construction;
(iii) a survey of the domestic construction industry;
and
(iv) studies for the preparation of the Fourth Highway
Project.
2.       Total project cost was US$25.9 million, about 90% of the
appraisal estimate of US$2B.7 million, in spite of increased scope,
mainly because of lower than expected construction costs. The project
was financed by two co-donors (9ADEA, ADF) with the Association providing
US$15.6 million.
3.       The project achieved considerable success and the re-evaluated
rate of return is 20%, compared with the ERR of 17% estimated at
appraisal. The road reconstruction component was fully and efficiently
accomplished. The re-evaluated ERRs were higher than forecast, mainly
because the cost of reconstruction was less than estimated; the re-
evaluated ERR for the Zinder-Nigeria road was 19% vs. 13% estimated and
for the Maradi-Nigeria road 16%, same as estimated. The road maintenance
component did not entirely meet the targets set, however, the amount
completed was very substantial and this component achieved an ERR of 23%,
instead of the 28% originally estimated. Additionally, the capability of
the highway maintenance entities was markedly improved. The survey of



- iv -
the construction industry has proved useful in preparing IDA's
industrial developaent project (Cr. 1225-NIR).
4.       The following points are of particular interest:
(a)   The road construction was completed on time and below
cost, something not often achieved in a remote location
(para. 3.05 et seq.);
(b)   A lesson for future construction projects in this area is
e                          that the standard road cross section used in open country
must be changed when passing through towns and villages
(para. 3.05);
(c)   The training component was very successful and was
expanded to include the establishment of a permanent
training center (para. 3.10); and
gd)   The cost of the project was less than estimated and
surplus funds were used for the preparation of the next
project, to extend the life of the training component and
to provide additional technical assistance (para. 3.11
and 3.18).



NIGER
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT CR. 612
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The project was the fourth in the highway sector in Niger.
Previous Bank Group operations in the roads sector comprised: the First
Highway Project in 1964 (CR. 55-NIR, US$1.5 million) which financed cons-
truction of 60 km of roads primarily for groundnut traffic; a US$85,000
grant in 1965 for a road maintenance study which became the basis for the
Highway Maintenance Project in 1968, (CR 128-NIR, US$6.57 million) for
the reorganization of routine maintenance, provision of deferred mainte-
nance and road feasibility studies; and for the Second Highway Project in
1971 (CR. 231-NIR, US$6.55 million) for construction of 140 km of agri-
culture access roads and preinvestment studies of selected roads.
1.02     Niger is one of ahe largest landlocked countries in Africa, with
an area of 1.3 million km , 90% of which is desert. Only in the extreme
south of the country is the land fertile and rainfall sufficient for
cultivation of major crops (millet, groundnuts, sorghum, and cotton).
The most important economic and administrative centers and most of the
5.3 million population are located in the south. The topography of the
country is flat and presents no major physical obstacles to road trans-
port.
1.03     About half the GNP is provided by agriculture, mainly food crops
such as millet, sorghum and more recently cow peas for export to
Nigeria. The industrial sector provides only about 15% of GNP, but earn-
ings from uranium deposits mined at Arlit are significant, representing
as much as 65% of exports earnings in some years in the past. The sharp
decline in the price of uranium since 1981 has been an important factor
contributing to the country's difficult financial situation in recent
years.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION
2.01     The project consisted of:
(a)   implementation of a four-year program of periodic mainte-
nance for gravel and paved roads, including procurement of
equipment, and training of specialized Department of
Public Works (DPW) staff using technical assistance;



-2-
(b)   reconstruction and improvement of the Zinder-Nigerian
Border Road (113 km), and Maradi-Nigerian Border
Road (49 km), including construction supervision; and
Cc)   a survey of the domestic construction industry.
Maintenance Program
2.02     To execute the annual periodic road maintenance program, force
account construction by DPW's own forces, properly organized, was deemed
the most efficient method, with the expectation that force account work
would cost about 30% less than work done under contract. The project
provided technical assistance for the organization of DPW to do force
account work on a large scale, including the training of specialized
personnel. The program was expected to be completed in four years.
2.03     Four regravelling units were to be formed in two stages over a
three-year period, using equipment provided by the project. Ultimately,
the units were expected to be able to maintain an annual quota of 320 km
of gravel roads. The regravelling units were also expected to improve
routine maintenance by stockpiling soil along the roads. Equipment was
to be delivered in two lots consistent with the availability of trained
personnel to operate it. During the period of training of up to three
years, the regravelling units were to be phased in and the regravelling
works were to be executed by contractors financed by the Government, on a
gradually diminishing basis as the force account units took over. It was
expected that some works might be carried out by domestic road con-
tractors subject to the results of the domestic construction survey.
2.04     The project provided about 160 man-months of technical assist-
ance to DPW for highway maintenance, including one highway engineer,
three mechanics, two chiefs of regravelling units, and an expert in rou-
tine maintenance of paved roads. The Government agreed to appoint qua-
lified personnel as counterparts to the consultants team which was to
commence work in October 1976.
Zinder-Nigerian Border Road (113 km)
2.05     Of the old road the Zinder-Bande (73 km) section was poorly
aligned and the gravel was almost entirely worn out.  It was depressed in 
many places and was often covered with wind-blown sand and flooded during
the rainy season. The Bande-Nagaria section had been built to gravel
standards with FED financing in 1967, but the surface was badly deterior-
ated. The remaining section, Tinkim to the Nigerian border, was an earth
track passable only during the dry season.
2.06     The entire road from Zinder to the Nigerian border was to be
constructed to two-lane paved standard, with pavement 6 m wide, roadway
width of 8 m and design speed of 100 km/h, consistent with projected
traffic requirements, terrain and soil conditions. To achieve this
standard, the sections Zinder-Bande and Tinkim-Nigerian border had to be



- 3 -
completely reconstructed, the Bande-Nagaria section upgraded and rea-
ligned as necessary, and the recently constructed Magaria-Tizkim section
paved.
2.07     The justification for the reconstruction was contingent on cons-
truction on the Nigerian side of the border of the connecting Babura-
Kunya Road (96 km). It began before the project received Board approval
(see para. 3.05) and was completed in 1978.
Naradi-Nigerian Border Road (49 km)
2.08     The Road had been built in 195B-59 with FED financing to one-
lane paved standards. Traffic had become too heavy and the surface was
severely cracked and deteriorated; over one 10 km section traffic had to
run on the gravel base course which was almost worn out.
2.09     As one of the main connecting routes with Nigeria, and the
shortest route between Nianey and Kano, the Road had become one of the
most heavily trafficked in Niger. In view of the traffic the Nigerian
Government had to build a two-lane paved road from Kano to the Niger
border. The project therefore provided for the Maradi-Nigerian Border
Road to be widened to standards similar to those of the Nigerian Road.
The design provided for a 10 m formation with a 7 m bituminous pavement
designed for a 13 t axle load and design speed of 100 km/h. The existing
horizontal alignment required changes but the vertical alignment needed
improvement in only a few places.
Survey of the Domestic Construction Industry
2.10     The project provided for eight man-months of consulting services
to make a survey of the domestic construction industry. The consultants
were to review the status of the industry, and taking into consideration
potential construction activities, identify problems which might hinder
its growth, and propose solutions. They were also to review current
bidding and contracting procedures, sources of capital and financial
services available to small contractors, and the need of domestic con-
tractors for technical assistance.
Cost Estimates
2.11     The cost of the project, net of taxes and duties, was estimated
at US$28.7 million equivalent, of which foreign costs US$24.7 million
(86%) and local costs US$4.0 million. Taxes and duties totalled about
US$9.8 million equivalent.
2.12     Construction cost estimates were based on the consultants' de-
tailed engineering estimates. Costs of equipment and technical assist-
ance for the maintenance program were based on average costs prevailing
in West African countries. A physical contingency of 10% was provided.
Price contingencies were as follows:



-4 -
1976    1977    1978/1979
Road construction     16.5%   14.5%       13.5%
Services              14%      12%        12%
Equipment             10%      8%          8%
The price contingencies exceeded the suggested inflationary levels of the
Bank Group because of concern that inflation might be higher in Franco-
phone Africa.
2.13     BADEA and ADF participated in co-financing the project as
follows:

Total (Net of Taxes)    15,600   7,000       3,600        2,515   28,715
2.14     ADF agreed to finance 100% of the cost, net-of-taxes, of the
Zinder-Dogo section (28 km) of the Zinder-Nigerian Border Road.  IDA and
BADEA were to finance 69% and 21% respectively of the total cost of the
remainder of the road (85 km) and all other project components. The
Government was to provide the remaining funds.
2.15     The Government undertook to meet recurrent expenditures for
routine and periodic road maintenance operations on the basis of esti-
mates in 1974 prices for 1976-79, to be adjusted for price inflation,
determined from the consultants road maintenance study, as follows:

Total, including other costs   1,170    1,220    1,400    1,420
The Government agreed to review the proposed budget with the Association
by May 31 each year.
2.16     Contractors were to be prequalified for the road construction
contracts which were to be awarded following international competitive
bidding.



-5-
Important Covenants
2.17     The main covenant was the undertaking of Government to provide
funds sufficient for routine and periodic maintenance operations on the
classified road network. Effectiveness of the Credit Agreement was con-
tingent inter alia on the effectiveneas of the BADEA and ADF Loan
Agreements.
Negotiations, Board Approval and Effectiveness
2.18     Credit negotiations took place in October 1975.  There were no
major issues. The project was approved by the Board on February 17, 1976
and after a long delay, the Credit became effective on January 31, 1977.
The delay was due to difficulties in assembling co-financing and the long
time needed by the co-donors to make their loans effective.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
3.01     The project was successful.  Road construction was completed
much as planned, the technical assistance proved generally satisfactory
and the maintenance program, although not fully achieved in scope, was a
substantial and worthwhile effort.
Procurement
3.02     Procurement for the project was generally expeditious.  Follow-
ing prequalification, bids for road reconstructioa were invited. The
contract for the Dogo-Nigeria Border Road (85 km) was awarded to the
Nigerien/French joint venture, and for the Naradi-Nigerian Border Road
(49 km) to a French/German joint venture.  The ADF-financed Zinder-Dogo
Road (28 km) was awarded to a Nigerien firm which had not been prequa-
lified. This firm arranged thereafter to subcontract most of the job to
a French firm, with its own participation in the work being minimal.
3-03     The contract for construction supervision was awarded to the
consulting firm which had made the feasibility study;  that for technical
assistance and training to the consulting firm which had prepared the
road maintenance program.  The contract for the study of the local con-
tracting industry was awarded to the former, but only after prolonged
delays, largely in negotiation of the contract (para. 3.17).
3.04     Following international competitive bidding, orders for equip-
ment were placed in mid-1978 of which the bulk was delivered in February
1979. Spare parts, amounting to 20% of the value of the original orders,
were subsequently ordered from the suppliers who supplied the equip-
ment. Procurement of weigh-bridges was completed in 1979.

Road Construction
Dogo-Nigeria Road
3-05     The Dogo-ligeria Border Road (85 km) was completed satisfactor-
ily in May 1979, approximately on scheduie, with a construction period of
25 months. The main problem experienced was aeolian deposition of sand
over about 14 km of earthworks, due to the fineness and lack of cohesion
of the sandy soil. An expert from a French firm recommended a combi-
nation of laterite facing and shallower side slopes in the affected sec-
tions, which was done at a cost of about USS100,000.  Other minor work,
including surfacing work to protect the road from erosion, and minor
revisions to drainage works, aggregated to about US$600,000. There was
also a political problem to which a technical solution was applied. The
consultants' design called for the road to skirt the town of Magaria,
crossing the market place on an embankment 2m high, having a 2:1 side
slope. The Prefect outraged at this insensitive chopping in half of the
town called a halt to the works. The contractor and consultant main-
tained that NTPTU had approved the plans, but this did not satisfy the
Prefect. IDA's engineer was able to negotiate a compromise whereby the
embankment was lowered 60 cm, side slopes were softened and two sets of
pedestrian steps were built in the market area. There is clearly a need
for more awareness of "urban" design requirements, instead of the appli-
cation of a standard cross-section willy-nilly.
3.06     Partly because of cautious allowances for contingencies, follow-
ing a period of high world inflation, and partly because of good competi-
tion and efficient contractors, there was a savings on the civil works
component which allowed the Credit to be used to finance the preparation
of the fourth project and associated studies (see para. 3.18).
Maradi-Nigeria Road
3-07     The construction of the Maradi-Nigerian Border Road (49 km), was
completed satisfactorily in March 1978, seven months ahead of schedule.
The construction of an additional 1.6 km link to the main east-west road
was carried out during the construction, as an addition to the contract.
After the first wet season improvements were required to provide satis-
factory drainage. The only problem experienced during construction was a
lack of bitumen for surfacing of the road during the Fall of 1977 due to
supply problems in Nigeria, where the bitumen was obtained.
Zinder-Dogo Road
3.08     The Zinder-Dogo Road (28 km), financed by ADF, was completed
satisfactorily in May 1978, a few months behind schedule.
Technical Assistance
3.09     A contract with consultants was signed in November 1977 for
provision of technical assistance to DPW for highway maintenance, a year
later than the date specified in the Credit Agreement. The delivery of



-7-
maintenance equipment was late and, consequently, there was no need for
the consultants to begin work before March 1978. In mid-1978 the con-
sultants' training plan was approved and with the arrival of some of
their team training was initiated.  Early in 1979 the full team was in
place. While there was some doubt that a sufficient number could be
trained in time to man the four regravelling brigades, over 200 men,
including 48 mechanics, 120 drivers and 53 equipment operators, were
trained by Spring 1979, at which time the brigades began field oper-
ations.
3.10     The training leadership was of a high standard, but the subse-
quent operation of the brigades indicated that additional training was
needed, particularly of mechanics. An unused workshop building had been
made available for training purposes. In view of the continuing need for
training, the Association agreed in November 1979 to finance from the
Credit physical improvements to the building, as well as teaching aids
and materials, and to extend the contract of the Director of the Training
Center. A further 175 personnel were trained in the period of November
1979 - April 1980.
3.11     In April 1979, the Association agreed to finance from the Credit
the addition of an organization/methods expert, a chief mechanic for the
central workshop, a chief plant inspector and a purchasing/warehousing
expert, at a cost of USS625,000. This additional assistance was sche-
duled for one year but was extended for a second, partly to cope with a
large increase in equipment, which was provided by Japan. The organi-
zation and methods expert proved particularly useful and was able to work
out details of many ideas of the prolific but busy Director of Public
Works. Technical assistance to the brigades terminated in early 1981.
However, the organization/methods and the training experts were retained
to provide advice on various matters including the planning of a new
training center and other elements of the proposed Fourth Highway
Project.
Road Maintenance
3.12     After an unfortunate incident, in which the expatriate expert in
charge of the bituminous road maintenance unit was ousted by the Ministry
of Public Works for lack of progress when in fact bitumen could not be
poured due to lack of a decanting unit, the Association agreed, in Narch
1979, to financing by the Credit of an expenditure of US$250,000 to pur-
chase equipment to strengthen the bituminous brigade and to establish a
second one. The Association also agreed to finance the cost of a new
bitumen training officer, who was to be in post concurrent with delivery
of the new equipment, for the full 20-month period originally provided.
A successful operation was mounted when the equipment materials and
trainer were available in May 1981. Two brigades were formed and pro-
duced good results. By the time the expert left in July 1982 bituminous
repairs had been completed between Niamey and Zinder.
3.13     The regravelling brigades started field operations in April 1979
with the objective of regravelling 100 km of roads in the Niamey district



-8-
during the following six months, using funds from the national budget for
operating expenses. There was, understandably, a slow build-up in pro-
duction and only 118 km of roads were regravelled during PYl978-79.
3.14     Performance improved significantly in 1979-80 when a budget of
CFAF 400 million was allocated for the regravelling brigades in addition
to about 1.3 billion for other current maintenance expenditures. Finally
about 292 kn of regravelling work were completed. This performance
should be considered as satisfactory considering that the brigades also
contribute to the execution of other urgent works (strengthening of
slopes, bridge repairs, etc.).
3-15     Budgetary difficulties were faced in 1980-81 due to the auster-
ity program initiated by the Government following the severe drop in
uranium prices;  in addition, the lack of sufficient material slowed down
the execution of works in the Zinder area and increased the average
regravelling cost which reached CFAF 2.5 million/km instead of 2.1 to
1.3 million/km as in other brigades. Finally, only 204 km of roads were
regravelied. The actual results of the three first fiscal years are as
follows:
kn regravelled     Cost (million CFAF)
1978-79                118           110 (US$400,000 approx.)
1979-80                292           400
1980-81               204            400
Total                614           910 a/
a/ The average cost per kilometer was CFAF 1.5 million (US$5.500) for
reprofiling the entire formation including reinstatement of side
drains and turnout and a 15 cm pavement 7m wide.
3.16     At appraisal, output had been estimated at about 80 km per bri-
gade annually, which may have been over-optimistic. The actual produc-
tion was somewhat limited, in part by the operating funds made avail-
able. Additionally, the difficulty of finding materials, the inadequacy
of some equipment (D6 bulldozers were found to be too light for efficient
borrow pit development), the long distances and slow functioning bureau-
cracy in Niamey were all contributing factors. Under more favorable
conditions the original objective might have been achieved. 17
Study of the Construction Industry
3.17     The selection of a consultant to study the domestic construction
industry was greatly delayed mainly because the two original bidders both
thought they could squeeze more out of the study than the appraisal
1/ For FY1982/83 funds amounting to CFAF 336 million were available for
the brigades, which were sufficient for up to 170 km to be regra-
velled during the fourth and final year of the project.

report foresaw. After tightening the terms of reference to avoid an
overly long report, a firm finally accepted to do the job in half the
man-months originally bid; there was in fact a cost saving on this compo-
nent and the delay had no adverse effect. In March 1981, a draft report
produced by the consultants made a number of over-ambitiou3 suggestions
including the creation of nine new domestic construction companies and
the provision of massive technical assistance. The Government, as a
consequence, had the consultants re-focus the report in a more conven-
tional direction. A copy of the final report was received in November
1981, and has served as a basis for preparing a component of an indus-
* -        trial development project (Cr. 1225-NIR).
Use of SurDlus Credit Funds
3.18     With lower than expected road construction costs (para. 4.20),
it was evident that Credit funds would remain unused. The Association
therefore agreed to a number of additions to the project at the request
of the Borrower as follows: (a) In mid-1980, it agreed to the purchase of
bituminous maintenance equipment, and a hydrological study of drainage
structures on the Niamey-Tillaberi Road; (b) on other occasions it agreed to
the preparation of the Fourth Highway Project, including feasibility
studies of the Niamey-Say Road (57 km) and the Malbaza-Dabnou road
(20 km), architectural design of the training building and extension of
the technical assistance team; (c) in the latter part of 1981 the Closing
Date was extended from June 30, 1981 to June 30, 1982, and subsequently
to June 30,1983, to enable the remaining funds under the project to be
used to begin construction of a training building, to be completed under
the the proposed Fourth Highway project. As part of the preparation of
the paved road maintenance program in the fourth project, a full pavement
inventory, including trenching and deflection studies was undertaken.
This study will also serve as a starting point of the data base for pave-
ment management. The inventory was further extended in 1982 to include
an inventory and inspection of bridges and other drainage structures--
another foundation for the data base. Changes to the Credit Agreement to
permit the use of funds in this -way were made by exchange of letters
between the two original signatories, and -ere reported to the Executive
Directors.
Project Costs
3.19     Total project cost, including the additional components, is
USs25.9 million, or 90% of the appraisal estimate of US$28.7 million.
Excluding the additions, the even larger difference between the cost of
the project and the cost estimated at appraisal reflects the following:
(a) price inflation was substantially less than forecast; (b) the impact
of inflation costs was reduced because some of the roads were completed
ahead of schedule; (c) the cost of road construction may have been over-
estimated; and (d) the bids received were considerably lower than might
have been expected inasmuch as construction activities in Francophone
Africa had slowed down by the time tenders were received. The estimate
of price inflation was made at a time when a number of Bank-financed
projects had experienced large overruns because Drice contingencies had



- 10 -
been underestimated in the face of world-wide inflation.  Consequently, a
more ample price contingency a1lowance was provided under the project.
3.20     The Association-BADEA financed road construction, including
additionsl works cost US$12.0 million versus US$16.5 million estimated at
appraisal, or 72%. The cost of the ADF-financed road was 55% of esti-
mate. The cost of supervision of construction was US$0.9 million vs.
USS1.7 million at appraisal, or 53%.
3.21     Maintenance equipment cost US$5.6 million including additional
expenditures for spare parts and bituminous maintenance, versus
US$4.7 million estimated at appraisal, or 17% more. Technical assistance
cost US$4.5 million, versus US$2.1 million at appraisal, or 220% more,
reflecting the marked increases in its scope and duration.
Project Execution
3.22     Relatively few problems were experienced during project execu-
tion. Disbursements lagged about one year behind throughout the imple-
mentation period, reflecting mainly the delays in obtaining road mainte-
nance equipment. However, the extension of disbursements into the period
1981-83 was due to the additions to the project, which of course pro-
longed the disbursement period. As of December 1983 disbursements aggre-
gated US$15.0 million. US$0.6 million remains to be cancelled, out of a
credit of US$15.6 million.
Consultants Performance
3.23     In general, the performance of the two consulting firms, for
road construction supervision and for technical assistance, was good.
The performance for technical assistance and training consultant was
excellent in general, with one or two unfortunate incidents counter-
balanced by some outstanding contributions. The teams responsible for
forming, working up, and running the four brigades did a comprehensive
and efficient job. The field work was done under difficult conditions,
which nevertheless did not affect the rigor and discipline of brigade
management. The individuals in the team were all experienced in this
type of work. The training component was well-handled and what started
as an ad hoc pre-start-up program for the brigades grew into a small
permanent training center to be expanded under the fourth project. The
other individuals ranged from excellent to satisfactory and all have
strengthened the institution.
The various technical studies showed more variety. The deflection survey
and inventory (see para. 3.18) was a competent piece of data collection,
but there was a reluctance to produce a firm work program based on the
data. The architectural design on the new training center became too
ambitious, and IDA's comments were not conveyed to the architect, with
the consequent need to redesign.



- 11 -
The consultant for supervision of civil works was competent and correct,
but occasionally reluctant to make decisions. Reporting and accounting
were to a high standard and very timely.
Covenant Experience
3.24     On the whole the Government met the covenants, except for the
important obligati.)n regarding the provision of funds for periodic main-
tenance. The Association may have been over-optimistic about the extent
of Government resources but, in any case, the decline in uranium prices
was the major factor.
3.25     There was a covenant concerning the collection of data for main-
tenance planning. It was found that the MPN did not have the staff to do
this and it was agreed to have the consultants provide an organization
and methods expert for the purpose. The collection of data then pro-
ceeded satisfactorily.
IV. REEVALUATION OF THE ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN
4.01     During appraisal the project was justified on the basis of quan-
tified benefits arising from:
(a)   savings in vehicle operating costs and road maintenance
expenditures, resulting from the reconstruction or up-
grading to paved standards of the Nigerien sections of the
two major trunk roads connecting Naradi and Zinder to
Kano, the most important city of northern Nigeria; and
(b)   savings in vehicle operating costs and maintenance expend-
itures from the implementation of a four-year program of
periodic maintenance. -
4.02     Additional but unquantified benefits from road improvement in-
cluded savings in journey time, increased riding comfort and reduction
of accidents. Another important objective of the project at appraisal
was to consolidate through appropriate technical assistance and training
the efforts started under the Highway Maintenance Project (Credit 128
NIR) for improving and expanding the force account maintenance capability
of the DPW. The technical assistance and training programs were signifi-
cantly extended after 1970 with surplus funds from the road construction
component.  Their impact went far beyond assistance limited to the
creation of regravelling brigades, as envisaged initially. What emerged
was finally an extensive institution-building program which has been set
up following a comprehensive review of functions and performances of each
service of the DPW. The most important achievements include: (a) im-
provement in the operations of the important Service Materiel, its ware-
houses and procurement procedures; (b) reorganization of the regional
administration of the DPW; (c) improvement and development of analytical
accounting; (d) creation of an efficient organization and methods'
bureau, directly under the Director; and (e) improvement of the service



- 12 -
personnel and creation of a permanent training center for all levels of
staff.  These efforts will be pursued under the Fourth Highway Project.
No attempt has been made to estimate a rate of return for these improve-
ments but they are essential for the long-term efficiency of the Ministry
and for the successful implementation of further highway projects.
Re-estimated ERT_
4.03     The re-evaluation of the ERP. of each component of the project
was based on final costs for works and an estimate of recurrent costs
such as road maintenance expenditures based on analytical accounting.
The VOC's used for the re-evaluation are those adopted for the prepar-
ation of the Fourth Highway Pro ect. They show a significant increase
over the appraisal estimates, 1/ mainly for trucks. Average daily traf-
fic and traffic composition used in the re-analysis were based on the
latest traffic counts made in November 1981 by the DPW with the assist-
ance of consultants. The ex-post re-evaluation based on actual costs and
recalculated benefits shows an overall ERR of 20%, i.e., three points
above the rate estimated at appraisal (17%). The rate of return for the
Zinder-Nigerian Border Road is re-estimated at 19% (cf. 13% at ap-
praisal). For the Maradi-Nigerian Border Road the rate is the same
(16%). However, the rate for the maintenance program is now 23T -stead
of the 28% anticipated at appraisal.
4.04     The methodology for quantifying benefits for the economic evalu-
ation is basically the same as that used during appraisal except for the
definition of the "without" case. In the economic re-evaluation the
reference "without" case is not a "do-nothing" alternative but an assumed
postponement of the investment for several years until it becomes abso-
lutely obvious that the overdue investment must be realized. This method
appears more realistic than a theoretical "do nothing" solution adopted
at appraisal which assumes that no investment would be made during the
life of the road (20 years in the case of a paved road). This method
results in a slightly lower ERR than with the method adopted at
appraisal. Road maintenance costs (routine and periodic) are based on
actuals as revealed by the cost accounting introduced by the BCEON team.
Maradi-Nigerian Border Road
4.05     Construction costs were 20% lower than estimated at appraisal
(Table 4) but traffic failed to meet expectations.  In 1982 only 236
vehicles/day were registered on the new road instead of 429 at appraisal.
This important discrepancy affects only the traffic of light vehicles
traditionally associated with groundnut exports to Nigeria. Neither the
consultants nor the appraisal mission anticipated the dramatic fall in
groundnut exporzs to Nigeria after the drought nor re-routing of Niger
1/ Due largely to the dramatic increase of oil prices but also from an
underestimation of VOC at appraisal resulting from the use of unrea-
sonably high annual mileage estimates.

imports avoiding Nigeria. !/ Revised traffic forecast are based on the
actual 1982 structure of traffic and assume an average growth of 6%. The
analysis shows that factors which influenced the ERR favorably such as
lover investment cost, significantly larger VOC savings resulting also
from the higher proportion of heavy trucks have compensated for the
effect of lower traffic of light vehicles. The ex-post ERR is 16%, the
same as estimated at appraisal.
6
Zinder-Nigerian Border
4.06     Construction costs were 12% lower than estimated (Table 5) but
actual traffic is higher (235 vpd in 1982 instead of 176 as forecast)
mainly heavy trucks, since oil imports from Kano to the uranium mines now
transit through the new road via Zinder and Agades. On the basis of past
trends, the future traffic growth has been estimated at about 6.5%, which
is slightly better than the 5.5% projected at appraisal. From these
favorable adjustments the recalculated ERR is now 19% instead of 13% as
estimated at appraisal.
Maintenance Program
4.07     The economic re-evaluation has been done only for the invest-
ments directly associated with the creation of the four regravelling
brigades. The appraisal was made on the assumption that the 80 km/year
brigade, i.e., 320 km/year, of regravelling would be required to maintain
the network to normal standards, and to avoid the ba -ld up of a backlog
of deferred maintenance. For administrative and budgetary reasons, in no
way connected with the brigades or their management, output never reached
80 km per year, though it could well have done so in the season 1980/81
if sufficient funds had been available.
4.08     Details of the ex-post re-evaluation of the project are pre-
sented in Table 6. The ERR is now estimated at 23% compared with the 28%
at appraisal. This lower rate of return reflects simultaneously:
(a) higher costs both for equipment and technical assistance (CFAF 2.1
billion instead of CFAF 1.7 billion, 1982 prices); (b) the lower output
of the brigades (60 km/year/brigade instead of 80 km). On the favorable
side: (a) savings on V.0.C. are now 40% higher than estimated at
appraisal (CFAF 42/km instead of CFAF 30/km); and (b) average traffic on
1/ Niger's groundnut production fell from 260,000 t in 1971-1976 to
42,000 tons in 1975. Since this date, total production has been
between 80,000 and 90,000 tons. All exports of groundnuts have
disappeared since 1975 but the traffic forecast was based on export
levels of 66,000 tons in 1981, increasing to 84,000 tons in 1986 and
124,000 tons in 1996. Before the drought total registered exports of
groundnuts was about 100,000 t/year of -which two thirds were exported
to Europe through the Port of Cotonou and the remainder mainly to
Nigeria.  The dramatic congestion of the Port of Lagos during the
1975-78 period contributed to the diversion of Niger's import traffic
through Lagos to the Cotonou and Lome routes.



- 14 -
maintained gravel and earth roads has been tentatively estimated at 55
vehicles/day, which is slightly lower than that envisaged at appraisal.
This reflects the fact that a higher proportion of works was accomplished
on ordinary earth roads than envisaged at appraisal.
4.09     The re-evaluation shows that the major handicap to better per-
formance in regravelling operations has been the shortage of funds for
financing the recurrent costs of periodic maintenance (fuel, labor, mate-
rials). As observed in 1981, the lack of funds brought two brigades to a
complete standstill. However, technically, with the existing adequate
equipment, and both the good technical assistance and training which have
been provided, the brigades can in fact reach their objectives of 80
km/year as shown by their performance of 1979-B0 (78 km/year).
4.10     The analysis also pointed out the high cost of regravelling
operations in the Zinder area, which lacks easily exploitable materials
(CFAF 2.5 million/km as opposed to CFAF 1.2 million in other regions).
Since the Government will continue to face budgetary constraints in the
coming years, attention should be given to the selection of roads for the
regravelling programs which are economically justified. This focus im-
plies the appointment of a qualified economist in DYW. The Fourth
Highway Project, through the creation of the new Road Management Unit,
will address this deficiency.
4.11     The re-evaluation indicates that Government savings on mainte-
nance costs on the two roads represent about 20% of total benefits (esti-
mated at 23% at appraisal). Reduced VOCs will directly benefit the owner
of private cars and commercial vehicles. Since the transport industry in
Niger is competitive, most of these benefits have very likely been passed
on to producers and consumers.
4.12     In conclusion, the re-estimated ERRs compare favorably with the
appraisal estimates and reconfirm the appraisal assumptions and esti-
mates.
V.  INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPNENT
5.01     The institutional development aspects of the project resided in
the highway maintenance component, initially to the extent that the proj-
ect incorporated training of personnel at various levels and the transfer
to DPW of know-how concerning management, supervision and execution.
5.02     As the project progressed and it became evident there were sur-
plus funds in the Credit, additional technical assistance was provided to
meet the demonstrated needs, including the improvement of training faci-
lities, preventive maintenance, workshop management, purchasing and
stores, and methods and operations. These initiatives helped to improve
the organizational structure as well as to provide better accounting,
procurement and stores methods. Moreover, what started as an ad hoc pre-
start-up training program for the brigades grew into a small permanent
training program, which will form the nucleus of training activities at



- 15 -
the training center to be completed under the Fourth Highway Project.
Altogether, the institutional developments aspects of the project were
successful (see also: "Niger, a Case Study of Institutional Development
in the HiRghway Sector" - OED, February 1983).
VI. BORROWER AND BANK'S PERFORMANCE
6.01     The Borrower's performance was generally good, although the
Goveriment was able to provide only a portion of the funds committed to
routine and periodic maintenance because of the country's deteriorating
financial situation. The Government deserves credit for its backing and
support of technical assistance efforts and the project in general.
6.02     The Association's performance was likewise good.  The project
formulation appears to have been both sound and responsive to the
needs. The flexibility of the Association with regard to the intro-
duction of additional technical assistance was helpful. At the request
of the Borrower, the Association was cooperative in utilizing Credit
funds (which would otherwise have become surplus) for additonal project
components including the preparation of a follow-up project. Supervision
of the project was comprehensive.
VII. IMPACT OF THE PROJECT
7.01     The project had a substantial impact on the sector.  Road cons-
truction improved substantially two main trunk routes, one of which was a
link in the Nigerian route to the sea. The periodic maintenance program
improved between mid-1979 and September 1981 by about 600 km of roads to
a standard at which they could be routinely maintained. In the process,
with the help of technical assistance, DPW's periodic maintenance orga-
nization and capability were signiftcantly improved. The project also
prepared the way for the proposed Fourth Highway Project, which contains
a substantial training component.
VIII.  CONCLUSIONS
8.01     The project's success was above average compared to other road
maintenance projects in the Sahel. While the length of roads which re-
ceived periodic maintenance did not attain the targeted objective, due in
part to the Government's limited funds, the amount completed was large
and important institutional objectives were achieved in the domain of
road maintenance. Under the project, two major roads were satisfactorily
reconstructed, below estimated cost and ahead of schedule.
8.02     The cost of the project was substantially below estimate en-
abling additional infrastructure, equipment and technical assistance to
be provided with the funds thus freed, to meet demonstrated needs. Con-
sequently, the economic rate of return (20%) was higher than the
appraisal estimate (17°).



- 16 -
8.03     The institutional development objectives of the project were
ambitious and their successful achievement was comparable with the
success of the project as a whole.
8.04     BADEA and AD! co-financed the project with the Bank. There was
full cooperation between these parties and the Government and, on the
whole, project implementation proceeded smoothly.
