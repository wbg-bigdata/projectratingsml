MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AND THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A FOURTH RURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.          I submit for approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan of US$75 million equivalent and an IDA credit of SDR 143.7
million (US$200 million equivalent) to the People's Republic of ChiPa to help
finance a Fourth Rural Credit Project. The loan would have a term of 20 years
including five years of grace, with a standard variable interest rate, and the
credit would be on standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity.
2.          Background.  During the past decade, China's rural economy
witnessed remarkable growth and structural change as a result of economic
reforms including the introduction of the production responsibility system
(PRS), increased producer prices and the enlarged role of the mprket. Recent
government strategies in agriculture have focussed on stabilizing grain
production, mainly through irrigation expansion and rehabilitation, and
developing remaining underutilized land, and making uplands, natural pastures,
and water surfaces more productive for expanding production of nonstaple
foods, forestry and commercial crops. The Bank Group lending to China's
agricultural sector has generally supported the above noted strategies. To
date, 26 operations amounting to $2.6 billion, cover the full spectrum of
geographic areas and subsectors, with a focus on: land development,
irrigation, and drainage; upgrading support services such as research,
education, credit, and seeds improvement; developing specialized subsectors
including forestry, rubber, fruit, livestock and fisheries; and supporting
area development including soil conservation and settlement. Implementation
of the ongoing Bank Group-assisted projects in the agricultural sector is
satisfactory with disbursements, by and large, outpacing those in other
countries and sectors.
3.          A key feature of China's economic reforms has been the
decentralization of investment decision-making and separation of the
government's economic functions from administrative functions. As a part of
this reform process, the role of the government budget in financing commercial
investments in agriculture and agroindustry (among others) is rapidly
decreasing, with financial institutions assuming an important role in resource
mobilization and allocation.  In support, the government befan in 1979 but
more concertedly since 1985, to reform the banking system. I In this effort,
the Bank Group has been assisting China, through economic and sector work and
lending operations, in developing a coherent strategy for financial sector
development.
4.          The Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), which has been the
beneficiary of the previous three IDA-assisted rural credit projects, and
would be beneficiary of the proposed (fourth) project, is a government-owned
I/     The World Bank, 'China: Finance and Investment" and "Financial
Sector Review: Financial Policies and Institutional Reforms", Reports Nos.
6445 dated June 11, 1987 and 8415-CHA dated June 29, 1990.

specialized bank. ABC undertakes mainly commercial banking functions for
China's rural sector and manages state funds allocated for agriculture and
grain and non-grain commodity procurement. Through its nationwide network of
branches and affiliate township-level rural credit cooperatives (RCCs) --
financial institutions collectively owned by farmers--, ABC has the capability
of reaching deep into rural areas for resource mobilization and real sector
development. Using this unique status, ABC is in the process of increasing
its medium-and long term lending for bankable investments in rural areas.
Starting from the ongoing Rural Credit III project (Cr. 1871-CHA), ABC has
begun to use RCCs, on a pilot basis, for onlending project funds for
investments by households. For the proposed project also, ABC would use RCCs
as a channel for lending to smaller subproj cts undertaken by households,
wherever feasible. In addition, ABC would use a network of Supply & Marketing
Cooperatives (SMCs) which traditionally distribute farm inputs and provide
marketing services to farmers, for subloan collections on an agency basis.
Recent PCRs on IDA-assisted Rural Credit I Project in Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region (Cr. 1462-CHA) and the IFAD-assisted Rural Credit project in
Hubei province have indicated that the implementation of the two projects has
been satisfactory with considerable impact on real sector development
objectives, increases in per capita incomes and rural employment, and
upgrading of ABC's institutional capabilities for investment appraisal and
portfolio management. Implementation of the ongoing Rural Credit II and III
projects is also satisfactory.
5.          Recent Bank Group Review of China's Financial Sector.  A recent
Bank review of China's financial sector indicated that the steps taken during
1978-89 have indeed contributed to the emergence of a broader financial market
and provided alternative financing sources for government, enterprises,
households, and financial institutions. The government response to the Bank's
financial sector review recommendations has been quite positive (para. 3).
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the People's Bank of China (PBC), the main
agencies responsible for financial sector development, have begun preparation
of a technical assistance project for Bank Group assistance, which would focus
on reforms in six specific areas including the payments system, bank
supervision, accounting for financial institutions, legal framework for banks,
and strengthening of PBC's research department and its fiscal agency and
market regulation role.
6.          The government has also agreed that as a part of the proposed
Fourth Rural Credit Project, it would carry out with the Bank Group a mid-term
review of the progress made in implementing overall financial sector reform,
including credit and interest rate policies, rationalization of the interest
rate structure, and upgrading of banking regulation and supervision
arrangements; and of the progress made in carrying out the proposed project
including the institutional development program for the Agricultural Bank of
China (ABC). Starting with the proposed project, subsidies on onlending of
Bank Group funds to ABC are being eliminated. The government has also agreed
to carry out with the Bank Group a review of rural investment and finance
focussing on, among other aspects, the role and functions of the nationwide
rural credit cooperative system, and on legal, operational and supervisory
framework for the expanding network of non-governmental financial associations
in the rural sector. The proposed operation would thus be placed in the



3
context of this broader sector dialogue with the government, while advancing
several of the most sustainable development programs in agriculture.
7.          Project Objectives and Description.  The main objectives of the
proposed project would be as follows: (a) to stimulate growth and
diversification of agriculture by financing profitable investments by farmers,
collectives, state farms and enterprises, and (b) to promote efficiency of
rural financial intermediation through introduction of sound, market-oriented
policies, and development of the main institutions concerned with rural
savings mobilization and lending. The project, which would be carried out
over a period of five years, would provide funds to ABC and RCCs for medium-
and long-term credit programs in crops, livestock, fisheries, and establishing
agroprocessing and marketing facilities, and for technical assistance in
continuing its institutional development programs. The total cost of the
project is estimated at US$550 million with a foreign exchange component of
US$120.2 million. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in China are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. Maps are also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 8387-CHA dated October 9, 1990 is also being distributed
separately.
8.          Credit Component.  To implement the project's credit component,
ABC has developed an indicative investment program (FY1991-95) in crops,
livestock, aquaculture, and agroprocessing and marketing facilities, with a
focus on increasing the productivity of natural pastures, underutilized
uplands and water surfaces based on recognized local comparat`7e advantage.
The proposed investment program would be flexible so that ABC could make
modifications in its lending strategies based on subloan appraisals, including
market and credit risk analysis. Subborrowers woula include individuals and
specialized households, collectives, cooperatives, township and village
enterprises, state farms, SMCs and enterprises set up by state farms, local
governments and SMCs. ABC has established satisfactory subloan appraisal
criteria and organizational arrangements to carry out such appraisals.
Retroactive financing of SDR 17.96 million ($25 million equivalent) is being
recommended for subloans/expenditures made/incurred after January 1, 1990 but
before Loan and Credit signing and consistent with the project terms and
conditions.  Expenditure eligible for retroactive financing relates mainly to
subprojects for which an early startup was considered essential for mobilizing
local resources especially by using underemployed labor available in project
areas during winter months, and for maintaining the momentum of project
preparation and implementation.
9.          The credit program would be implemented mainly in the Autonomous
Region of Inner Mongolia, five provinces including Shaanxi in the northwest,
Liaoning and Jilin in the northeast, Jiangxi and Guangdong in central and
south China, and Beijing municipality. The program in these areas has been
substantially appraised by the Bank Group, since these regions/provinces would
be first time beneficiaries of a Bank Group-assisted project with ABC. Given
the line of credit nature of the proposed project, ABC could also use a part
of the project funds for financing investments in other regions/provinces,



4
mainly those covered by previous IDA-assisted Rural Credit Projects including
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Cr. 1462-CHA), Fujian and Hunan (Cr. 1642-
CHA) and Hubei (Cr. 1871-CHA).   ABC branches in these jurisdictions have
demonstrated their capabilities to appraise and implement longer term lending
programs by applying internationally accepted techniques of financial and
economic appraisal and technical standards (para. 4). Lending in other areas
would require prior consultations with the Bank Group which would take account
of the economic rationale of the activities proposed to be financed and
institutional capabilities of ABC's local branches to implement the lending
program.
10.         Technical Assistance Component.  The proposed project would
provide technical assistance to ABC and subborrowers for implementing the
project's credit program and to ABC for its and RCCs' institutional
development. Following upon the financial appraisal of overall ABC operations
in two provinces during project preparation, and in-house system reform
studies recently completed under Rural Credit III project, the proposed
project would assist ABC to develop various aspects of its operations
including long-range business planning; credit plan formulation and
preparation; lending policies and procedures with regard to its major clients;
monitoring of loan portfolio; assets and liabilities management; internal
audit and controls; and financial management of the RCC system. It would also
strengthen trainers' training programs at ABC's three national institutes and
provincial staff training colleges.
11.         Rationale for IDA support.    Besides continuing the Bank Group's
support to ABC for modernization and diversification of agricultural
production, the project would make important contributions to environmental
protection, poverty alleviation, and increasing employment potential for
women. The project's technical assistance will assist ABC in upgrading its
financial management, lending policies and procedures, management information
system, and human resource development. As ABC is the national bank for the
rural sector, the Bank Group support to increasing its operational efficiency
would in effect contribute to overall financial sector development. The
project would also serve as an important vehicle to continue the Bank Group's
dialogue with the government on financial sector policies and institutions
(paras. 3 and 6).
12.         Agreed Actions.  In addition to the agreements referred in para. 6
above, the project includes key financial covenants and understandings
focussing on more efficient allocation of resources and ABC's continued
profitability and financial viability. Specifically: the government would
onlend project funds to ABC at market rates, i.e., for loans in foreign
exchange, at the IBRD's standard variable rate, and for local currency loans
at a non-subsidized rate based on ABC's weighted average interest cost of
longer term domestic funds (currently at about 8X). Interest rates charged by
ABC to subborrowers would permit ABC to retain an interest spread of at least
2.52 (after payment of 4ncome and adjustment taxes to MOP) or such other
spread as may be agreed between the government and the Bank Group; interest
spreads on ABC's total banking business would be sufficient to maintain ABC's
overall financial viability and profitability; and interest rates charged by
ABC would not be less than its interest rates for similar subloans for similar



5
purposes outside the project. Similar terms will apply to RCC subloans. The
government and ABC have also agreed that ABC's ratio of equity to risk assets
would not be less than 52 and that the government and ABC would develop, by
December 31, 1991, a recapitalization plan for ABC indicating the mechanisms
of replenishment of ABC's equity, on standards acceptable to the Bank Group.
The goal would be to raise, in phases, ABC's risk-weighted capital adequacy
ratio to 82 as per international standards. Agreements have also been reached
on strengthening of ABC's project organization at headquarters; content and
timing of institutional development initiatives; and technical guidelines for
project implementation. For environmental protection, ABC and the government
have agreed that each Project Management Committee (PMC) at the provincial and
county levels would include a representative of the local Environment
Protection Agency (EPA), that measures would be taken to protect the
environment in specific subprojects reviewed during the Bank Group appraisal
and that subproject activities would conform to appropriate guidelines on
environmental control issued by provincial and national governments, and
acceptable to the Bank Group.
13.         Benefits and Justification.  The project's major benefits would be
incremental production of a variety of commodities and increased rural
incomes. At full development, the value of the project's incremental output
of crops, livestock and fisheries and value-added benefits of agroprocessing
and marketing facilities, would be about $600 million p.a. with significant
potential for import substitution and export promotion. The project would
enhance technical know-how of many processing facilities either by improving
an existing technology or by Introducing a new one. The project would reduce
seasonal unemployment and underemployment by generating the equivalent of
90,000 full-time jobs and contribute to poverty alleviation. In particular,
additional employment would be created in remote mountainous and rangeland
areas where alternative job opportunities are limited. About one-third of the
152 counties already identified for project implementation, are classified as
poor counties by national and provincial standards, where relative income
levels are extremely low and incremental income benefits would be substantial,
contributing to narrowing of income disparities and reducing poverty. Another
major social benefit resulting from the project would be improvement of
women's position in their role as entrepreneurs and active participants in
labor markets. Over 282 of ABC's total staff being women, many of which
holding managerial and professional positions, the project would further
strengthen their role within ABC through training components. The project
will have a positive impact on environment through subprojects assisted, and
with appropriate organizational arrangements instituted, it will ensure
environmental assessment and protection. In particular, the project would
introduce innovative new range management techniques to China's ecologically
delicate northern grasslands (in Inner Mongolia and Jilin) as an integral part
of livestock subproject formulation and approval. Financial rates of return
(FRR) on representative subprojects are estimated to range between 142 and 35X
and corresponding economic rates of return would vary from 24% to 41X. For
the project as a whole, the FRR and ERR are estimated at 242 and 272
respectively. ABC would benefit from the project's institutional development
in terms of increased efficiency of its overall operations including improved
lending decisions and reduced subloan default risks.



6
14.         Risks.  The project faces no unusual technical, organizational or
financial risks. Technologies to be adopted in agroprocessing are generally
of standard designs, procurement requirements for machinery and equipment
would provide technology choices to subborrowers, and training of factory
workers and managers would ensure safe and optimal operations. ABC would
introduce internationally accepted techniques for financial and economic
appraisal of subprojects; establish a Technical Experts Group at ABC
headquarters to assist in and oversee subproject implementation, reinforce
field level arrangements for technical feasibility studies of subprojects, and
supervise project lending. ABC would also appraise borrowing enterprises
including an assessment of their overall financial condition and managerial
capability. All this would help reduce subloan default risks. The project
would provide adequate spread to ABC to cover its transaction costs on project
lending including a reasonable provision for bad debts. The financial
appraisal of ABC's overall operations indicates that ABC is a reasonably
liquid and financially viable institution and suitable covenants have been
introduced to ensure its continued profitability and viability.
15.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Loan and Credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Association
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Loan and
Credit.
