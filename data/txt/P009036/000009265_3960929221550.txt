REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
PRIVATE INVESTMENT CREDIT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:                   The Republic of Turkey
Beneficiaries:              Private financial institutions and private
enterprises.
Amount:                     US$200 million equivalent.
Terms:                      Seventeen years, including a five year grace
period, at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate.
On-lending Terms:           The Government will on-lend the Bank funds to the
Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) on the
same terms and conditions as the Bank loan plus a
0.5Z on-lending fee. The sub-borrowers would have
the option of borrowing in one or more of five
currencies (DM, Sf, Sterling, US$, Yen) and would
bear the foreign exchange risk. The PFIs will
charge the sub-borrowers the appropriate LIBOR cost
of the currency or currencies selected plus a
spread to be negotiated with each sub-borrower.
The PFIs will carry the cross-currency risk and
manage it in accordance with the prudential
regulations of the Turkish banking law.
Project Description:        The proposed Project would provide long-term funds
to help finance the private investments needed to
sustain Turkey's export drive in the 1990s. By
channeling these funds through the private banking
system the Project would continue the process of
strengthening individual financial institutions as
a strategic complement to the on-going program to
improve the efficiency of the financial system.
The Project would also help the real sector respond
adequately to on-going and planned reforms by
providing it with resources needed to restructure
existing, or invest in new, capacities that make
economic sense in the reforming environment.



- ii -
Project Beneflits & Risks: The Project would assist Turkey in its transition
to a more stable economy by providing the needed
long-term funds today while helping the financial
system improve its ability to perform its
intermediation function in future. Based on past
experience, the Project is expected to support
private investments in the order of US$400 million
and exports of about US$200 million, and result in
the creation of about 14,000 new full time jobs.
With a minimum economic rate of return of 15X, the
investments financed under the Project are expected
to be efficient and internationally competitive.
The potential project risks would stem from a slow
down in private investment due to deteriorating
macroeconomic conditions and a change in the
investment climate; a change in relative prices due
to a reversal of trade liberalization policies; and
a reluctance to assume foreign exchange risk by
Turkish investors in unstable economic conditions.
Such a deterioration in economic conditions would
trigger a reconfiguration of the Bank's overall
relationship with Turkey, and a possible suspension
or cancellation of the Project.

REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
PRIVATE INVESTNENT CREDIT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTODUCTION
1.01        Since 1980, the Turkish Government has been pursuing an outward
oriented development strategy that places increasing reliance on market forces
and the private sector. Turkey's major success in the 1980s was clearly on
the export front. Exports as a share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) tripled
between 1980 and 1985 from 5X to 15X, while manufactured exports increased
from $1 billion in 1980 to $9 billion in 1989, growing to 801 of merchandise
exports. The growth of exports was, however, made possible by expanding
utilization of existing capacity from the depressed levels of the early 1980s;
investment in manufacturing actually declined significantly in real terms, and
fell as a share of total investment from 341 in 1980 to 15% in 1989. This
decline reflects the drastic cutback of public investment in manufacturing, in
line with the Government's intention of relinquishing its role in the
productive sectors, but also the sluggish response of private investment,
which has declined in real terms since 1986. Export growth slowed
considerably in the second half of the 1980s; the exports/GDP ratio actually
declined slightly between 1985 and 1989. Owing partly to reduced export
incentives (para. 2.09) and an appreciating TL (para. 2.04), exports hardly
grew in 1989 and are estimated to have increased by only 41 in 1990. With
today's high capacity utilization rates (average capacity utilization rates in
the private sector have reached 75% and exceeded 801 in certain key sectors
such as textiles), a recovery of investments in tradeable has become
increasingly important for Turkey in developing its capacity for further
export growth. The Project aims at providing the initial impetus to increased
investments in export capacity needed for the 1990s.
1.02        The Project is proposed in light of policy reforms and
institutional changes being undertaken and planned on the macro, financial and
industrial fronts. Macroeconomic performance has improved with a rapid
acceleration in the rate of growth to about 9X in 1990 from a sluggish 1.71 in
1989. The Central Bank has acquired the autonomy to implement an independent
program of monetary restraint. As a consequence, inflation had abated from
701 in 1989 to 491 in 1990 despite the inflationary effects of the Gulf
crisis. In response to this external shock, the Government has introduced
significant adjustment measures beginning in September 1990. In approving the
1991 budget, the Parliament introduced a 51 cut in non-personnel expenditures
across the board. Nevertheless, further fiscal adjustments are needed to
reduce the fiscal deficit to a more sustainable level, and make fiscal policy
more consistent with monetary policy objectives. In the financial sector,
policy and institutional reforms have been successfully completed under the
Second Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL II). Major distortions (and
quasi-fiscal subsidies) associated with preferential credits have been
eliminated, except in agriculture. Banks have strengthened their capital base
in line with new prudential regulations and, after a special portfolio audit,
have fully provided for non-performing loans. A bank restructuring
institution to resolve future bank failure and insure small depositors is



being established, and the system for bank supervision is being improved.
Reforms in agriculture credit interest rates and in the agriculture bank are
being pursued under the Third Agriculture Credit Project (Loan 3090-TU). In
the industrial sector, discussions with the Government on an industrial sector
adjustment program have focused on a further rationalization of the structure
of taxes and subsidies, to continue to remove anomalies and allow market
forces to provide a stronger guide to investment decisions.
1.03        Assuming sustained progress on these fronts, private investment
demand for capital goods can be expected to grow, but the availability of
medium-term credit to finance such investment is likely to be constrained over
the short-term without Bank assistance. Even after the planned adjustments
have been made, there will still be a time lag until the fiscal and industrial
policy reforms appear to be irreversible, and the banks are able to mobilize
sufficient term deposits which can be used for investment financing. During
the time window between policy reform and changes in the stock composition of
financial assets, it is essential that the Bank provide financial and
technical support for banks which want to establish a presence in the term
lending market. The objective of this loan is not to substitute for the
banks' own efforts to mobilize term resources. Rather, the intention is that
the proposed Project will directly support the reform process by providing
long term resources in the transition period between policy changes and
increased financial intermediation by the banking sector, and by strengthening
the financial sector's institutional capacity to carry out prudent term
transformation.
1.04        The Project is designed to build on the successful experience of
an earlier project. The Industrial Export Development Project (IEDP) of
US$300 million was approved by the Bank in January 1988. While this loan was
expected to be committed by 1992, it was actually fully committed by mid-
1989. IEDP has supported total investments in export-oriented activities
amounting to US$2.1 billion resulting in annual incremental output of US$1
billion, of which US$500 million was for exports, mainly to OECD markets.
Most investments were for the expansion or balancing of existing capacity in
activities in which Turkey has comparative advantage - textiles, rubber
products, glass manufacturing and tourism - resulting in sub-projects with
high economic rates of return (averaging 39X). Through the project,
compliance with the new prudential regulations and audit guidelines issued
under FSAL II was enforced for each of the participating commercial and
development banks, thus reinforcing at the level of individual institutions
the reforms being undertaken for the system as a whole. Annex I provides a
more detailed discussion of IEDP's economic impact.
1.05        The proposed Project will continue to support Turkey's export
expansion and diversification efforts by providing long-term funds for private
investments. The Project will pursue sustained implementation of the
Government's financial reforms at the intermediary level by ensuring that the
participating financial institutions (PFI) continue to comply with prudential
regulations and by improving the efficiency of the financial system especially
in allocating investment credit. The proposed Project consists of a credit
component of US$200 million and a technical assistance component of US$1



million. The credit component will finance viable private investments in the
production of any tradeable product or service, excluding agriculture.
However, based on past experience and the current pipeline of projects of the
PFIs, most investments are expected to be in the industrial sector. The
credit will be channelled initially through two private development banks and
eight private commercial banks. The technical assistance component will
provide training and consultancy services for the PFIs in project appraisal
and supervision to improve their project finance capability.
II. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR'
A. Economic Setting
2.01        Until 1980, Turkey's industrial development strategy was based
principally on import substitution in basic industries. The main policy
instruments employed were large investments in State Economic Enterprises
(SEEs) and generous tax and financial incentives combined with high levels of
protection. These policies led to rapid industrial growth, increasing
industry's share in GDP from 13% to 18X between 1963-77. But they also gave
rise to some serious weaknesses, such as severe anti-trade bias and lack of
competitiveness, high capital intensity, and low levels of productivity.
These weaknesses became apparent following the first oil price shock in 1974,
which resulted in growing current account deficits and a balance of payments
crisis that required comprehensive debt rescheduling between 1978 and 1980.
The ensuing shortage of foreign exchange and imports led to disruptions in
industrial production, sharply reduced capacity utilization rates (CURs),
declining output and an acceleration of inflation to over 1001 by 1980.
2.02       I- response to this crisis in early 1980, Turkey initiated an
extensive program of stabilization and reform. The structural reforms,
consisting initially of exchange rate devaluation, price deregulation, trade
liberalization, and export promotion, were designed to shift the economy
toward outward orientation and to promote efficiency through greater reliance
on market forces and the private sector - representing a major break from the
past interventionist policy regime.
2.03        During the first half of the 1980s, the Turkish economy responded
well to this adjustment strategy; output grew by nearly 51 per year led by
real export growth of about 201, inflation was reduced to 30X by 1986, current
account deficits were reduced, and international creditworthiness re-
established. However, stimulative fiscal policy accelerated the growth rate
during 1986-87 to an average of nearly 81 and contributed to a rise in
inflation to 701 by 1988. Despite significant reductions in public investment
during 1987-89, the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) stood at about
71 of GNP in 1989, down only slightly from its peak of 8X in 1987. Further
I Since most of the investments under the proposed Project is expected
to be in industry the focus of the sectoral analysis in the report is the
industrial sector.



reduction of the deficit was hampered by the large increases in public sector
real wages granted in 1989 (following a period of decline over much of the
1980s) and the growing burden of fiscal interest payments.
2.04        The momentum of growth shifted swiftly in 1988, with industrial
output beginning to contract by mid-year, reflecting a period of financial
instability and sharp swings in real interest rates, as well as the decline in
public investment. However, the large increases in real wages granted in mid-
1989 set the stage for a recovery of industrial output. GNP growth
nonetheless fell to 1.7% in 1989 as a severe drought reduced agricultural
output by 11. Slower growth accompanied by rapidly rising revenues from
tourism and workers remittances shifted the current account into surplus in
1988-89. In a setting of current account surpluses, rising direct foreign
investment, and growing foreign exchange reserves at the Central Bank, the
Government liberalized intorest and exchange rate determination and capital
account transactions during 1988-89. It also further removed tariff
protection and abolished all quantitative restrictions. Reflecting the
favorable external developments, the real exchange rate appreciated
significantly, by about 30% between end-1988 and mid-1990, raising concern
about the sustainability of the balance of payments performance. To slow the
extent of real appreciation and also to improve its reserve position, the
Central Bank purchased substantial quantities of foreign exchange in 1989-90.
However, this action led to a rapid expansion of base money, which was not
consistent with the targeted reduction of inflation. Despite the sharply
slower growth rates in 1988-89, inflation declined only marginally, reflecting
the rapid monetary expansion in 1989, the real wage increases, and the impact
of higher agricultural prices as a result of the drought.
2.05        The adherence to a tighter monetary program, accompanied by a
continuing appreciation of the real exchange rate and supported by a recovery
in agricultural output from the drought in 1989, helped to reduce inflation
from 70% in 1989 to 49% in 1990 despite the inflationary effects of the Gulf
crisis. The Central Government's budget deficit, however, rose substantially.
The Government was able to finance its deficit by borrowing heavily in the
domestic market at relatively low interest rates; with the real exchange rate
still appreciating, domestic rates remained negative in real terms. But the
recovery of industrial production, appreciation of the real exchange rate, and
reduction of import protection, contributed to a very rapid expansion of
imports and a sizeable current account deficit.
2.06        The need for fiscal adjustment became more urgent in view of the
deterioration in the balance of payments prospects following the emergence of
the Gulf crisis. Given its traditional close economic relations with Iraq and
Kuwait, the crisis is costing Turkey dearly not only due to the oil price
increase but also in foregone royalties from the Iraqi oil pipeline, export
losses, reduced worker remittances, lost income from construction contracts
and non-payment of Iraqi debt. The Government's immediate response to the
crisis was commendable. It allowed oil price increases to be fully passed on
to consumers and it raised revenues through a 5% across-the-board increase in
import duties and a 2% increase in the VAT rate on foodstuff. Additional
increases in the general VAT rate and on luxury items were implemented in



October 1990, with further increases planned through June 1991. In approving
the 1991 budget, the Parliament introduced a 5% across-the-board cut in non-
personnel expenditures. As in the past, further budget cuts are implemented
during the budget release process itself. Further fiscal adjustments,
however, are needed to reduce the fiscal deficit to a more sustainable level,
and to make fiscal policy more consistent with the tightening of monetary
policy by the Central Bank.
2.07        Assuming satisfactory progress on the Government's fiscal
stabilization efforts, private investment in industry can be expected to rise
significantly from its average level of about US$2 billion p.a. during 1987-
89. Using conservative debt-to-equity ratios, the demand for investment
financing would considerably exceed the loan amount under the proposed
Project. However, for the reasons discussed in Section C, if fiscal deficits
and inflation were to increase, investment demand in general and demand for
foreign exchange financing in particular would greatly suffer.
B. The Manufacturing Sector
2.08        The manufacturing sector in Turkey expanded during the 1980s by
directing output toward the external market. The share of output being
exported increased from 6% in 1979 to 50% by 1989, as manufactured exports
grew at a compound rate of 28% per annum over the past ten years. Growth of
manufactured output averaged 7X in the 1980s and, as of 1989, the sector
accounted for a quarter of GDP and 13.2% of formal sector employment. The
private sector accounted for about two-thirds of output and employment in
manufacturing enterprises employing 25 or more persons; including small-scale
production this share is even larger, rising to nearly 90% in terms of
employment.
2.09        Manufactured exports, which grew from 36% of total exports in 1980
to 78% in 1989, were the beneficiaries of a fundaiental shift in trade policy
towards outward orientation initiated during the 1980s. The main policy
instruments used to reform the trade regime were a significant depreciation of
the real exchange rate until 1988, a dismantling of quantitative import
restrictions, a lowering of tariffs particularly in 1989, and provision of a
wide array of special incentives for exporters. The latter have included
duty-free access to imports, the now abolished system of export tax rebates, a
tax credit equal to 20% of export earnings for exporters of more than $250,000
(recently reduced to 18%), direct and volume based subsidies, and export
credit extended at below market interest rates. These incentives were
considered necessary to spur Turkish industrialists, long used to producing
for a protected domestic market, into exporting, particularly in view of the
need to ease the foreign debt servicing burden. However, over the last two to
three years the extent of export incentives has been steadily reduced.
Exports as a share of GDP tripled during the 1980s, and the increased
participation in international markets also appears to have enhanced
productivity in the manufacturing sector through scale economies and learning
externalities, particularly for the private sector.



- 6 -
2.10        The pattern of export-led growth was prevalent across the entire
manufacturing sector (Table 2.1), as all sub-sectors increased their outward
orientation. While textiles still occupy a dominant share of manufactured
exports -39X in 1989- this share is actually lower than in 1980, indicating
the broad based nature of growth.

2.11        Recent developments in manufacturing have to a large extent
paralleled macroeconomic developments. Following annual growth rates of
nearly 101 in 1986-87, manufacturing growth rates fell to the 2-3X range
during 1988-89, with three consecutive quarters of declining production (third
quarter 1988 to first quarter 1989). This reflected the tightening of fiscal
policy in the second half of 1988 and particularly the very sharp rise in non-
preferential lending rates in the fourth quarter of 1988. However, since mid-
1989, the recovery of production has accelerated, and in the whole of 1990,
output grew at an annual rate of over 8X.
2.12        Capacity utilization rates (CURs) reflect production trends.  Thus
the peak in weighted CURs for the private sector was reached in first quarter
1988 (Table 2.2), with several key sectors experiencing close to what is
generally considered full capacity utilization in Turkish industry. With
weaker production for the rest of 1988, CURs fell, but this trend was reversed
in 1989, as overall private investment in manufacturing declined and
production began to rise after mid-year. Thus CURs by the end of 1989 had
recovered close to their previous peaks, and can be expected to reach new
highs, particularly if the current industrial expansion continues.

C. Private Manufacturing Investment (PMI)
2.13          The export boom of the 1980s was accommodated largely through the
utilization of existing capacity from the depressed utilization levels of the
early 1980s; investment in manufacturing actually declined significantly,
falling in real terms to 55% of its 1980 level by 1989. This decline
primarily reflects the drastic cutback of public investment in manufacturing
to 15% of its 1980 level by 1989, in line with the Government's intention of
relinquishing its role in the productive sectors. Thus by 1989, 83% of the
investment in manufacturing was accounted for by the private sector, up from
40% in 1980.
2.14          The rising share of private investment in manufacturing does not,
however, reflect buoyant growth. Indeed apart from a period in the mid-1980s
(1984-86), PMI either stagnated or declined slightly, and growth in the 1980s
averaged less than 2% per annum (Table 2.3). For the decade as a whole, the
trend of PMI was influenced by several opposing factors. On the one hand,
investors benefitted from generous tax and depreciation allowances, which
provided a strong incentive for established and profitable firms to continue
incremental investments for expansion and modernization. Yet, the uncertain
macro environment, particularly the high and variable inflation rates tended
to inhibit major investment in new plants. And the overall scarcity of



- 8 -
medium-term financing, itself a reflection of high inflation (see Chapter
III), also constrained investment for those enterprises that could not
generate sufficient resources internally. Retained earnings and depreciation
thus accounted foz much of the resources for investment financing. Within
this overall pattern, growth of investment in consumer and capital goods was
more sigr.ificant, whereas investment in intermediate goods, still the largest
category, declined over the decade.

2.15        The initial period of weak investment (1980-83) reflected the
ability of firms to raise production by expanding capacity, given the low
levels of prevailing CURs. Investment increased rapidly during 1984-86 as
manufacturing production expanded and CURs in several sub-sectors approached
75Z. Falling inflation and a period of relative political certainty were
presumably also positive factors. The recent weakness of PMI, which declined
by 17X between 1986 and 1989, may be attributed to higher rates of inflation
with the associated shortening of planning horizons and incentives for
diverting resources into housing and other inflation hedges, as well as the
decline in production between mid-1988 and mid-1989.
2.16        While PMI was declining between 1986 and 1989, total private
investment continued to rise, largely due to rapid growth in housing
investment. This growth reflected speculative purchases among wealthier
investors as well as the provision of generous interest subsidies by the Mass
Housing Fund for lower income households. By 1989, investment in housing had
risen to 281 of private investment while PMI had fallen to 15Z, down from 20X
in 1986. Investment in tourism has also grown very rapidly since 1984, but
accounted for only 41 of private investment in 1989.
2.17        At the same time that domestic investment in manufacturing was
relatively stable (at a rate of about US$2 billion per annum), foreign direct
investment was increasing rapidly, including in the manufacturing sector. Net
inflow of foreign capital reached US$663 million in 1989, up from US$106
million in 1987 and continued to rise in early 1990. This growth appears
related to the prior removal of foreign investment restrictions, the close
proximity of Turkey to expanding markets in the EC and Eastern Europe, low
wages in Turkey, the improved balance of payments position in 1988-89 and
subsequent liberalization of cApital flows. Judging from the distribution of
foreign investment permits, nearly two-thirds of the foreign capital inflow
appears destined for the manufacturing sector. Recently, several major
multinational corporations have announced large projected investments in
sectors such as autos and chemicals, generally through joint ventures with
local Turkish firms.
2.18        Finally, for the first time in several years, domestic PHI appears
to have recovered dramatically in 1990, reflecting the rapid output growth
since mid-1989 and the increased interest of foreign investors in joint
venture projects. Indirect evidence for the recovery of PMI includes the
rapid growth of capital goods imports and utilization of investment incentive
certificates of the State Planning Organization in 1990. Preliminary
estimates place the growth rate at close to 271. (The growth in 1990,
however, was exceptionally high because of the real appreciation of the TL and
the liberalization of imports. Compared to inflation in 1990, PMI grew by a
high but less dramatic 151 above inflation).
2.19        Given the prevalence of higher CURs, the evolution of
manufacturing investment will become increasingly important for developing the
capacity for further export growth and at the same time meeting the expected
growth in domestic demand. While PMI can be expected to rise in the short



- 10 -
term, a sustained growth in investment will depend on a number of factors that
are closely linked to macroeconomic stability.
2.20        Perhaps most important for the investment climate is the
perc.ption that the Government's fiscal and monetary policies will be
successful in reducing inflation. By contrast, with inflationary expectations
still rampant, the risk adjusted returns from speculative investments would
tend to dominate, reducing investment demand for manufacturing. This tendency
would be reinforced by the knowledge that ultimately demand would have to be
compressed to contain the inflation. Adherence to the Government's monetary
program without a corresponding fiscal adjustment, by raising interest rates,
would also weaken investment demand.
2.21        The recent liberalization of the capital account and strengthening
of the Turkish Lira suggest that borrowing in foreign exchange could become a
potentially more important source of investment financing particularly for
investments generating foreign exchange income. The demand for such financing
would arise from the continued scarcity of medium-term financing in domestic
currency, and the Government's decision to phase out the Foreign Exchange Risk
Insurance Scheme (FERIS), whereby the Central Bank assumes the foreign
exchange risk associated with foreign borrowing, because of its fiscal cost.
For this type of financing to gain importance, however, the final borrower
must have reasonable confidence regarding the stability of the real exchange
rate. In particular, the perception of an exchange rate that is overvalued
would dampen the demand for such foreign exchange credits, thereby reducing
investment. Finally, the willingness of foreign creditors to extend the
maturity of their lending to Turkish investors will also be contingent on
their perception of long-run macroeconomic stability. Given this uncertainty
the availability of long-term investment funds from the Bank would be
important and would enable PMI to continue.
D. Bank's Industrial Lending Strategy
2.22        The Bank's strategy for industrial lending to Turkey is to assist
GOT in: (a) strengthening and expanding the private sector, including
restructuring and privatizing State Economic Enterprises (SEE); (b) developing
competitive financial markets by continuing to strengthen the banking system
and expanding the capital markets in support of private sector activities; and
(c) establishing the technology infrastructure to promote faster productivity
growth and achieve greater international competitiveness.
2.23        The strategy for private sector development comprises, first of
all, correcting distortions in the incentive framework so that private
investment decisions become more consistent with economic goals. Although the
basic redirection of the policy framework toward market orientation has been
accomplished (Chapter II), further adjustments in the incentive framework are
needed to improve resource allocation. These measures would be accompanied by
efforts to restructure and privatize SEEs to make them efficient and
competitive enterprises. Second, the private sector requires the services not
only of an efficient banking system but also of deep capital markets.
Expanding the private sector entails financing requirements that the banking



- 11 -
sector alone cannot meet without increasing system risks. Moreover,
privatization efforts would be constrained without capital markets that are
deep and broad enough not only to mobilize the required equity and debt
resources but also to modify ownership patterns. Finally, within the
framework of a competitive market policy, a world-class technology
infrastructure is required for the Turkish private sector to upgrade process
and product quality and develop new products, particularly for exports. The
systems of metrology, standards, testing and quality assurance are central to
this effort. They also constitute the single most important policy instrument
to develop small and medium-scale industry, particularly in promoting
efficient subcontracting arrangements.
2.24        The Bank's lending program for industry is designed in accordance
with this strategy. The planned operations would focus on further reforming
the incentive framework for industry and accelerating the SEE privatization
process (proposed Industrial Sector Adjustment Loan); developing the capital
markets by removing distortions in the pricing between bank credit and market
securities and between debt and equity instruments, strengthening the
regulatory framework to promote safety, promoting institutional investors to
deepen the markets, and building an efficient institutional infrastructure
(proposed Third Financial Sector Adjustment Loan); and promoting technology
development by improving the quality control system, providing venture capital
funding and increasing the linkage between industry and research institutions
and universities (proposed Technology Project). The proposed Project is a key
element of this strategy. It will provide timely support for private
investments to enable the private sector to continue adjusting adequately to
the reforming incentive framework. Second, it will continue to increase the
capacity of the financial sector to provide investment credit efficiently.
Third, it will support investments in improved technology by providing import
financing for capital goods and related technical services.
III.   THE-FINANCIAL SECTOR
A. The Structure of the Financial System
3.01        Turkey has an extensive financial system.  The financial system of
Turkey consists of: (i) the Central Bank; (ii) seven Government owned
commercial banks (four of which are being privatized); (iii) 26 private
commercial banks; (iv) 20 foreign banks; (v) two private and one public sector
investment and development banks; (vi) the social security system and bank
employee pension funds; (vi) insurance companies and mutual funds; and (vii) a
rapidly growing stock market located in Istanbul, with about a hundred active
intermediaries of all sizes. Although the banking system still dominates the
financial sector, accounting for about 90% of total financial assets, the
capital market is growing rapidly. New institutions and instruments have been
created in recent years in response to a growing interest by investors and
issuers in non-bank market instruments.
3.02        About half of the banking system is controlled by the Government,
but this could decline with the privatization of four banks, the expansion of



- 12 -
existing private banks and the establishment of new private banks. While
these public banks were established to cater to specific sub-sectors, current
policies and strategies emphasize diversification as they have to compete with
the private banks on a more equal basis. The number of private domestic
commercial banks has remained basically unchanged since 1978, while the number
of foreign commercial banks has increased from 4 to 20. The entry of foreign
banks has not only introduced competition in some market segments but has
resulted in large transfers of banking technology to the local banks. Foreign
banks were active in interbank operations before the interbank market was
established. They also introduced know-how in securities trading.
3.03        Table 1 shows the relative performance of the four banking groups
for 1987-89 period. The relative shares of the four bank groups in total bank
assets have not changed significantly between 1987 and 1989.  The public banks
account for about 47X of total bank assets in 1989.  The agriculture bank
(TCZB) is the largest financial institution in Turkey and accounted for 20.8%
of the total assets of the banking system at the end of 1989, followed by Is
Bank (10.5%), Emlak Bank (9.2%), Ak Bank (6.2%), and Yapi Kredi (5.8%). The
participation of foreign banks has become more active but their relative share
remains small. At the end of 1989, foreign banks accounted for about 3.1% of
the assets of the system. The Turkish banking system remains highly
concentrated. The share of the four largest banks (TCZB, Emlak and two
private banks) in total bank assets was 46.7% in 1989. However, this share
has declined slightly due to the more rapid growth of the smaller private
banks. Within the group of private banks, the share of the four largest banks
(Is, Ak, Yapi and Garanti) is even higher.

3.04        The size of the financial system and trends in its growth are
summarized in Table 3.2.  During 1980-89, the system (M2) grew in real terms
by 12.1% per year which compares favorably to the 4.9% real GDP growth during
the same period. M2 as a percentage of GDP grew from 15.2% in 1980 to 27.6%
in 1989. Concurrently, there has been an increase in demand for time deposits
as measured by the difference between Ml and N2 which widened from 2.5% in
1980 to 16.7% in 1989. Equally interesting is the rise in foreign exchange
deposits from zero percent in 1980 to 6.8% of GDP in 1988.  Such rapid



- 13 -
increase in financial depth after 1980 is explained by the macroeconomic and
financial sector reforms initiated in 1980, which included the maintenance of
positive real interest rates on deposits, the reduction of taxes and charges
on financial intermediation and lower inflation.2
3.05        Although the Turkish financial system has performed well since
1980 it is still shallow by comparison with other countries at a similar stage
of development. The ratio of M2 to GDP in Turkey is 27.6%, compared with thle
average of 39% for developing countries at similar income levels. Also the
ratio of broad money to GDP (including foreign exchange deposits) is only
slightly higher than the levels achieved in the early 1970s. These two
indices suggest that there is still ample scope for further progress in
resource mobilization.

3.06        The progress in resource mobilization is not fully reflected in
Table 3.2. In addition to the larger mobilization of bank deposits, several
new financial instruments, such as corporate bonds and more recently,
commercial paper, have been introduced. The government-issued revenue sharing
certificates were very well received and some of the banks have been allowed
to manage mutual funds. There has also been substantial revival in stock
market activities. The value of equity trading increased dramatically from
US$13 million in 1986 to US$800 million in 1989. The increase in the
activities of the stock exchange has been driven by tax incentives (capital
gains are tax exempt), the opening of the capital account, foreign portfolio
investments and increased interest by local investors. Although the market
has been growing rapidly it still shallow and volatile. Until it gains more
depth and liquidity through the participation of serious institutional
investors it is unlikely that it would be a major source of corporate finance
2 Developments in the financial system in recent years are documented in
more detail in the IBRD reports: Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (No.6095-
TU, May 15, 1986), Private Manufacturing - Assessment of the Impact of Past
Policies and Future Adjustment Needs (No.6684-TU, July 21, 1987), and Second
Financial Adjustment Loan (No.L2964-TU, June 21, 1988).

in the near future. The Government has asked for Bank assistance in
developing the securities market to enable it to reach its potential for
efficient resource mobilization and allocation (proposed Third Financial
Sector Adjustment Loan - FSAL III).
B. Banking Reform Program
3.07        The structural reforms of the real sector, particularly the rapid
devaluation and abrupt shift from negative to positive real interest rates,
resulted in an intensification of financial distress in key sectors of the
economy (Chapter II). Distress in the real sector quickly transferred to the
financial sector. The large volume of non-performing loans, distress
borrowing, distortions created by preferential credits, and deep-seated
problems of the public sector banks threatened to undermine the banking
system. In early 1988, the Government introduced a banking sector reform
program with Bank assistance under FSAL II to forestall a banking crisis,
strengthen the banking sector and further the process of financial
liberalization initiated under FSAL I. The program was designed to improve
resource mobilization and allocation by lowering taxation of the banking
system, reducing distortions created by preferential credits, and minimizing
currency substitution. On the institutional front, it aimed at strengthening
the banking sector by reforming prudential regulations to make them consistent
with internationally accepted guidelines and practices, carrying out a special
portfolio audit of the system to uncover the nature and extent of portfolio
problems, establishing a bank failure resolution mechanism to promote
confidence, and improving bank supervision and oversight to prevent the
recurrence of problems.
3.08        Implementation of the reform program is substantially completed.
Its success is evidenced by the absence of a banking crisis, although some
banks are still being restructured including the agriculture bank. Through
changes in prudential regulations and improved audits and monitoring of banks
the financial position and performance of the banking sector has been
clarified. The capital base of the banking system has been increased, and
non-performing loans have been identified, correctly classified and fully
provided for. An institution to resolve bank failures in an orderly manner
and insure small depositors is being established. With the establishment of
this institution, the bank supervision system would be complete with adequate
checks and balances to ensure quality on-site audits. Off-site monitoring and
external audits of banks have been greatly improved by the Central Bank,
through regular standardized reporting by banks and through quality control of
auditors, respectively. Public sector banks are moving away from sectoral
specialization into more diversified operations as they have to compete with
private banks on a more equal footing. Four of the public sector banks are
being privatized and the restructuring of the remaining banks, together with
the growth of private domestic and foreign banks and the establishment of new
banks, would reduce the absolute and relative size of public sector banking.
The banking sector is, therefore, now much stronger than it was two years ago.
3.09        As part of the Central Bank's reforms to redefine its role as an
autonomous monetary authority, the volume of preferential credits was severely



- 15 -
curtailed and the remaining interest subsidies transferred to the Government.
A gradual reduction of reserve requirements by banks reduced taxation of the
banking system somewhat. It is the Government's intention to complete this
reform by eventually abolishing all explicit intermediation taxes. With the
full liberalization of the capital account in August 1989, and equalization of
the treatment between foreign and local currency deposits, together with the
real appreciation of the TL in most of 1989 and 1990, substitution of local
currency deposits into foreign currency deposits not only stopped but
reversed. With these reforms, currency holding is now mainly market driven.
C. Investment Finance
3.10        Although the volume of credit to the private sector has increased
in real terms, medium- and long-term investment credit remains scarce. Term
finance in Turkey is provided mainly by the investment and development banks,
which until recently relied heavily on multilateral and bilateral
institutions, and Central Bank's rediscounts for their resources. Domestic
resource mobilization by these institutions has been limited. The deposit
money banks provided medium- and long-term loans to the extent that these
loans were partly rediscounted by the Central Bank (the rediscounted share
varies from 50% to 80% of the loan). However, the Central Bank facility has
been abolished as of December 1989. Medium- and long-term industrial loans
financed entirely out of the deposit money banks' own resources are limited.
Their access to long-term credits from international financial markets is also
limited to maturities of up to two years. With the availability of long-term
refinancing resources under the proposed Project, the commercial banks are
expected to play a more important role in this area.
3.11        Table 3.4 shows data on total industrial credit, as well as
estimates of medium- and long-term industrial credit in Turkey. The table
suggests that the growth in long-term credit has generally been stagnant for
four reasons: (i) Central Bank rediscounts have not increased in real terms;
(ii) development banks have experienced difficulties in mobilizing domestic
resources and their utilization of foreign credits were constrained by the
aversion by borrowers toward taking foreign exchange risks in unstable
conditions; (iii) deposit money banks have been unwilling to provide long-term
loans from their own resources a. they do not have long-term resources; and
(iv) in line with the dramatic growth in private investment in the non-
tradable sectors, the share of bank's overall credits to industry declined
from 31% in 1985 to 17% in 1989 while the share of the housing sector rose
from 11% in 1985 to 18% in 1988. However, the share of bank credits for the
housing sector declined to 15% in 1989 because of the general slow down in the
real estate market (Table 3.5).

3.12         To carry out necessary investments the private sector has
increasingly resorted to equity financing in recent years. The average
debt/equity ratio of 109 projects financed under the IEDP (Ln.2901-TU) was
30:70. Most investors are not willing to undertake large projects using
short-term loans. The availability of long-term investment funds under the
Project will therefore provide a strong impetus to increased private
investments.
D. Financial Markets
3.13         There has been considerable progress in the area of money and
capital markets. First, in May 1985, the Treasury moved to an auction system
for selling its securities and at the end of 1986 set up a regular auction
schedule, which has enhanced the Treasury's ability to sell its debt. Second,
in early 1987 the Central Bank introduced open-market operations. The further
development of these operations will enable the Central Bank to control more
effectively the money supply. Third, the interbank market is widely
considered a success. Daily volume is estimated to be around TL 150-200
billion compared with TL 4 billion in early 1985. The development of the
market has enabled banks with excess reserves to lend to banks facing
temporary liquidity shortages. Fourth, the introduction of foreign exchange
market in 1988 and gold market in 1989 have made a major contribution in



- 17 -
developing the financial market in Turkey. Finally, the opening of the
capital account in August 1989 was perceived as the final step needed to
complete the liberalization process.
3.14        Turkey's stock market has become much more active since 1986 when
it accounted for less than 3% of the financial system. The market
capitalization of the listed shares increased from US$935 million in 1986 to
US$3.2 billion in 1987, declined to US$1.1 billion in 1988, and then rebounded
sharply to US$6.8 billion at the end of 1989. As of December 31, 1989, the
market capitalization of the 50 companies listed in the Senior Market of the
Istanbul Stock Exchange amounted to US$6.8 billion, or roughly 10% of the
financial system and 8.6% of GNP. However, the size of the market is very
small in comparison to the stock markets in other developing countries such as
Korea (US$140 billion), Malaysia (US$39.8 billion), and Thailand(US$25.6
billion). The stock market in Turkey has not thus far been a major source of
investment finance. The growth of the market has been inhibited by several
factors: high and volatile inflation, low dividend payout, lack of adequate
disclosure requirements and audited financial statements3 and the absence of
institutional investors. High interest rates on other instruments especially
treasury bonds and deposits make it less attractive for investors to invest in
equities. Corporations are also allowed to issue commercial paper up to 6
times their equity. Moreover, interest expense on bank credit is fully tax
deductible including the inflation component making debt financing more
attractive than equity financing. FSAL I has made a major contribution in
developing the stock market by supporting the Government's efforts to improve
public dissemination of financial information by requiring auditing of
companies listed on the stock exchange and companies selling securities to the
public. A more comprehensive program to develop the capital markets is being
prepared under the proposed FSAL III.
3.15        Although the financial markets have grown rapidly and performed
relatively well their size is small and a large share has been channeled
towards the financing of the budget deficit through large holdings of
government bills and bonds. The most recent increase in deposit mobilization
is due to the foreign exchange deposits but these resources are mainly used
for trade financing. Sustained increases in long-term lending to the private
sector will therefore depend principally on: (i) greater resource
mobilization by the financial system with a more stable economy; and (ii)
reduced absorption of domestic financial resources by the government through
adequate fiscal adjustment. The project is designed in light of progress on
these reforms and serves as a transitory catalyst to encourage an adequate
supply response from both the financial and real sectors to these reforms.
I Starting January 1, 1988, the 50 companies listed in the first market
of the Istanbul Stock Exchange were required to have their 1988 accounts
audited.

IV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT
A. ProJect Objectives
4.01        Building on the success of the Industrial Export Development
Project (Ln. 2901-TU) the proposed Project aims to help finance the expansion
of Turkey's productive capacity needed to sustain its export drive by
providing long-term funds, and improving the credit delivery system that can
perform the investment financing function on its own in future. Specifically,
the objectives of the proposed Project are: (i) to support financially and
economically viable private investments in areas of Turkey's comparative
advantage, especially export-oriented activities, excluding agriculture; (ii)
to continue to assist TSKB and SYKB in their business and resource
diversification efforts to enable them to grow in an increasingly competitive
financial system; and (iii) to support the implementation of the Government's
financial sector reforms at the intermediary level by ensuring that
participating private commercial banks continue to be financially sound and
develop into intermediaries capable of mobilizing and allocating long-term
resources more efficiently.
B. Project Description
4.02        The proposed Project would provide long-term funds for private
investments to help fill the financing gap. Conservatively, Turkey would need
investment credit in the order of US$3.1 billion in the period 1991-93. This
estimate of credit needs is based on recent investment trends, the pipelines
of investment projects of the Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) and
their projected lending programs over the same period. Private industrial
investment over the 1991-93 period is estimated at roughly US$6.3 billion
assuming no growth. Assuming a debt/equity ratio of 1:1 credit requirement
would be about US$3.1 billion.
4.03        The funds would be sub-lent initially tnrough ten private
financial institutions (eight commercial banks and two development banks) to
sub-borrowers in foreign currency at LIBOR plus a spread for the PFIs, with
the sub-borrower taking the foreign exchange risk. The on-lending rate to the
PFIs would be the same as the Bank variable rate plus an on-lending fee of
0.5Z. The PFIs would bear the cross-currency risk and manage it in accordance
with the prudential regulations of the Banking Law. The participating
financial institutions would also bear the credit risks and be responsible for
appraising investment sub-projects in accordance with Bank standards, ensuring
that sub-projects are financially and economically viable with a minimum
Internal Financial Rate of Return and Internal Economic Rate of Return of 15Z
in real terms. Each sub-project appraisal report would also include a
statement of the impact of the proposed investment on the environment and
proposed preventive measures where appropriate (para. 4.19). Only private
investments in the production of tradeable goods and services, excluding
agriculture, will be eligible for financing.
4.04        A technical assistance component of US$1 million is geared to
assist the PFIs in institutional strengthening, with particular focus on



- 19 -
improving their project finance techniques, systems and procedures, through
staff training and consultancy services. Details of training and consultancy
requirements were discussed during appraisal. Considering its importance, the
PFIs have decided to finance this component with their own resources.
Implementation of this component would be monitored in the course of project
supervision to ensure that adequate funding by the PFIs of this component is
provided as planned.
C. Proiect Costs and Financing Plan
4.05        The total cost of the proposed Project is estimated at US$400
million of which about half would be in foreign exchange. The proposed Bank
loan amounting to US$200 million will finance about 50X of the project cost.
The balance will be financed through equity financing by private enterprises
(US$200 million equivalent). The project funds would finance less than 5X of
the investment credit needs of the private industry over a three-year period.
The technical assistance component of US$1 million will be financed fully by
the PFIs themselves.
D. Proiect Beneficiaries
4.06        Sub-Droiect Eligibility Criteria.  Under the IEDP explicit
eligibility criteria were prescribed to promote export-oriented investments.
These criteria were made flexible to avoid excessive concentration in a
particular activity. The sub-projects financed under the IEDP were required
to meet certain export achievement targets. However, with the opening-up of
the capital account, the full convertibility of the Turkish Lira (TL) and
further trade liberalization measures undertaken since 1989, the rationale for
targeting lending to export-oriented industries has disappeared. Thus the
proposed loan would be available for financing any efficient investment in the
production of tradeable goods and services, except agriculture. However,
since the loan funds under the proposed Project would be on-lent in foreign
currencies, prudence in lending is required to minimize unhedged exposures to
foreign exchange risk. To signal this need for prudence some differentiation
in lending terms between export and non-export oriented investments would be
required. Non-export o-iented industries would be subject to more stringent
financial covenants. Specifically, the debt/equity ratio for non-export
oriented companies would be 40:60 while that for export-oriented companies
would be 50:50. The debt service coverage ratio would be 2:1 for non-export
oriented companies and 1.5:1 for export-oriented companies. During
negotiations an agreement was reached with the Government and participat'ing
financial institutions that only sub-projects that meet the above-mentioned
eligibility criteria will be financed under the Project.

E. Particliating Financial Institutions and Eligibility Criteria
4.07        Under the proposed Project, Bank funds will be channelled
initially through two private development banks and eight private commercial
banks. As the leading private development banks in the country, TSKB and SYKB
have been the major sources of long-term foreign exchange resources for the
Turkish industry. TSKB enjoys good standing in the industrial and financial
communities. It has developed a cadre of competent staff with good project
appraisal skills and experience. During 1980-85, it faced severe financial
problems but, with Bank assistance, it has since fully restored its financial
viability. SYKB is a well managed financial institution and has played a more
active role in financing small- and medium-scale industries. However, it is
expanding its market scope and is moving into large-scale industry financing
as well. Participation in the Project by both institutions will be subject to
the eligibility criteria discussed below.
4.08        I=.  The project files contain a detailed appraisal of TSKB.
TSKB was set up in 1950 by a group of Turkish commercial banks and insurance
companies with the objective of providing long-term financing for private
industry. IFC also assisted TSKB as an investor and co-financier and at
present holds 2% of TSKB's equity. The Bank has actively supported TSKB's
development and as of June 30, 1987, had made to it 15 credits and loans
totalling $532 million. The latest loan of US$150 million for export
industries (IEDP) was approved in January 1988. Since 1980, TSKB has operated
in an extremely difficult financial environment. During the 1980-85, TSKB
faced severe financial problems because of the massive and successive
devaluations which resulted in large non-performing loans. The situation was
exacerbated by the lack of domestic resources and the restrictions in its
Charter, which prohibited TSKB from diversifying its activities beyond term
lending. Because of low profitability TSKB was unable to build up adequate
reserves and to raise new capital. As a result, TSKB was undercapitalized for
the type of business it was doing. The high non-performing assets and lack of
domestic resources led to a tight liquidity position and a negative interest
rate spread in 1985 on its existing portfolio.
4.09        The Bank mission which visited TSKB in October 1986 assisted
TSKB's management in devising a comprehensive financial and operational
restructuring program to address its fundamental problems so that it could
again play an active role in the financial system. The main elements of the
financial restructuring plan consisted of: (i) doubling share capital from TL
20 billion to TL 40 billion over the 1987-88 period; (ii) raising long-term TL
resources by TL 20 billion to enable TSKB to lend in local currency; (iii)
increasing the spread by introducing a 2% p.a. service charge; and (iv)
restructuring the terms of its existing quasi-equity loans. The main elements
of the operational diversification plan entails offering of a broader range of
banking services including: (i) working capital finance initially limited to
its existing clients; (ii) money market operations, especially commercial
paper; (iLi) capital market operations, especially government securities and
finance bonds; (iv) portfolio management; and (v) leasing.



- 21 -
4.10        To enable it to implement the diversification program, TSKB
initiated a reorganization study in November 1986 with the assistance of a
consultant from Morgan Guaranty Bank. The study was completed in January 1987
and implementation of the study's recommendations started in mid-1987. The
main objective was to transform TSKB from a development bank to a merchant
bank capable of performing all capital market activities. TSKB also sought
assistance from the Saudi American Bank for its treasury and computerization
program. TSKB's financial and operational restructuring is now substantialiy
completed. TSKB's paid-in capital was increased from TL 22.6.billion in 1986
,to TL 76.8 billion in 1989. A new quasi-equity agreement was reached with the
Government in May 1987. These arrangements have substantially increased
TSKB's capital base. On February 15, 1987, TSKB raised Y 9.5 billion in the
Japanese market through a private placement on satisfactory terms and
conditions. The proceeds of US$62 million equivalent of the seven year yen
issue was swapped in TL with the Central Bank at the discount rate. During
1988-90 TSKB raised an additional Y 20 billion from the Japanese bond markets.
These additional resources together with US$150 million from the Bank under
IEDP, enabled TSKB to increase its lending sharply during the 1987-89 period.
TSKB's net profit rose from TL 1.0 billion in 1986 to TL 28 billion in 1989.
Its assets rose from TL 544 billion in 1986 to TL 1,858 billion in 1989.
Today, TSKB is liquid and is considered a sound financial institution by the
financial community.
4.11        TSKB has developed good liability management skills.  It has been
successful recently in raising domestic funds by selling its commercial paper.
TSKB is now one of the most active participants in the fast growing Istanbul
Stock Exchange and is active in the money market and interbank trading
operations. It is also active in the underwriting of commercial paper for its
clients. The most difficult part of TSKB restructuring i.e., organization and
personnel was completed in May 1990. TSKB has managed its reorganization with
great care and is now well staffed to play a greater role in Turkey's
financial system.
4.12        Partici_ation Conditions.  The participation conditions for TSKB
under the proposed Project are: (i) its adherence to its board-approved
revised policy and strategy statements, as agreed with the Bank; (ii)
satisfactory implementation of its board-approved corporate development
program, as agreed with the Bank; (iii) a maximum debt/equity ratio of 10:1
and a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.10:1, as defined in the Loan
Agreement; (iv) a clean audit by external auditors in accordance with
internationally accepted accounting principles; (iv) compliance with the loan
loss provisioning and loan concentration standards, as agreed with the Bank;
and (vi) a minimum annual collection ratio of 85% (excluding cases under legal
action and write-offs). TSKB is currently in compliance with all the
participation conditions. Its continued compliance with these conditions will
be monitored regularly in the course of project supervision. Together with
its annual audit, TSKB's external auditors will certify in a separate opinion
TSKB's compliance with its maximum debt/equity ratio, its minimum debt service
coverage ratio, its minimum collection ratio and its compliance with the loan
loss provisioning and loan concentration standards agreed with the Bank.
Should it violate any of these conditions at any time the Bank will have the



- 22 -
option of suspending TSKB's participation in the Project. Continued
suspension for a period of six months would result in the cancellation of its
participation in the Project. A free limit of US$6 million equivalent is
approved for TSKB.
4.13        SK.  The project files contain a detailed appraisal of SYKB.
SYKB was set up in 1963 by five major commercial banks in Turkey to finance
private industrial investment. Is Bank, the largest private commercial bank
in Turkey, owns 60% of SYKB's paid-in capital, which amounted Lv TL 20 billion
at the end of 1989. SYKB has, to-date, received six loans amounting to US$285
million from the Bank. These were loans for the textile industries (US$15
million); labor-intensive industries (US$40 million); the small- and
medium-scale industries - SMI (US$80 million); Industrial Export Development
Loan (US$50 million), Agro-industries (US$50 million); and the Second SMI Loan
(US$50 million). As a whole, the investment objectives of all of these loans
have been met satisfactorily. The performance of SYKB was evaluated by the
Operations Evaluation Department and found to be satisfactory (PPAR dated June
6, 1989).
4.14        SYKB is a well managed financial institution and has built up a
team of competent staff. During the last few years, SYKB concentrated mainly
on providing long-term finance to small- and medium-size industries. However,
in line with the changes in the financial system and the expected demand for
funds from large industries, SYKB plans to amend its strategy to enable it to
expand its market scope. As a prudently managed financial institution, SYKB
plans to proceed cautiously in its diversification efforts. In this
connection, it has prepared a new operational. strategy to guide its
operations. It is also in active dialogue with a money center bank in New
York to obtain technical assistance for its zapital market operations and its
computerization needs. The appraisal missiton found SYKB's strategy to be
satisfactory.
4.15        Participation Conditions.  rThe conditions for SYKB's participation
in the Project would be the following:  (i) ..zisfactory implementation of its
board-approved business diversification plan, as agreed with the Bank; (ii)
adherence to its board-ap-roved revised policy :ind strategy statements, as
agreed with the Bank; (iii) a clean audit by exv:ernal auditors in accordance
with internationally accepted accounting princ DIes; (iv) compliance with the
loan loss provisioning and loan concentration cvtarudards, as agreed with the
Bank; (v) a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.10:1 and a maximum
debt/equity ratio of 10:1, as defined in the Loan Agreement; and (vi) a
minimum collection ratio of 85% (excluding cases under legal action and write-
offs). SYKB is currently in compliance with all the participation conditions.
Its continued compliance with the participation conditions will be monitored
regularly in the course of project supervision. Together with its annual
audit, SYKB's external auditors will certify in a separate opinion SYKB's
compliance with its maximum debt/equity ratio, its minimum debt service
coverage ratio, its minimum collection ratio and its compliance with the loan
loss provisioning and loan concentration standards agreed with the Bank.
Should SYKB violate any of these conditions at any time the Bank would have
the option of suspending SYKB's participation in the Project. Continued



- 23 -
suspension for a period of six months would result in the cancellation of its
participation in the Project. A free limit of US$3 million is approved for
SYKB.
Particigating Commercial Banks (PCB)
4.16        In addition to the two development banks, Bank funds will be
channelled initially to eight commercial banks. The Industrial Export
Development Project was the first Bank project in Turkey that used private
commercial banks as a vehicle to provide long-term funds to private
industries. The commercial banks' performance under this project has been
satisfactory. As commercial banks are major players in the financial system,
their participation has increased competition in the provision of investment
funds for private investments. The overall efficiency of the financial system
has been promoted because of the added competition. In the past,
participation by commercial banks has been constrained by their limited
project appraisal capacity and their lack of access to long-term domestic and
foreign resources. The proposed Project would help address these constraints
by providing the PCBs with matching long-term resources for on-lending and
technical assistance to improve their appraisal capacity.
4.17        All eight commercial banks (Ak, Is, Dis, Yapi, Garanti, Vakiflar,
Ekononi, Iktisat) which participated under the IEDP have indicated their keen
interest to participate under the proposed Project. Table 4.1 provides a
profile of these eight banks.' Based on the mission's assessment, all of the
banks except for Is and Iktisat are in compliance with the Project's
participation conditions and will be active participants. Is Bank is most
likely to be in compliance in early 1991. A more comprehensive evaluation of
Iktisat will need to be carried out to determine its eligibility. Continued
compliance by the PCBs with the participation conditions will be monitored
regularly in the course of project supervision. Should any PCB violate any of
the participation conditions at any time the Bank will have the option of
suspending its participation in the Project. Continued suspension for a
period of six months would result in the cancellation of a PCB's participation
in the Project.
4.18        Participation Conditions.  In view of the reforms undertaken in
the banking system, the selection of participating commercial banks has been
carefully done to ensure that only those banks that remain creditworthy in the
new regulatory environment participate in the Project. In the Turkish
context, these are important regulations that have had a positive impact in
institutional building and in encouraging financial discipline in the banking
system. All PCBs are required to meet the following conditions: (i) a clean
audit by external auditors in accordance with the internationally accepted
accounting principles; (ii) compliance with the new prudential regulations on
loan loss provisioning, capital adequacy, and loan concentration in accordance
with the Banking Law; (iii) adherence to their board-approved policy and
strategy statements, as agreed with the Bank; (iv) a positive real return to
4 Appraisal reports on these banks are available in the project files.

equity, defined as the ratio of year-end net profits after tax to total equity
at the beginning of the year less the WPI change for the same year; and (v) a
minimum collection ratio of 85X on its medium and long term loans (excluding
cases under legal action and write-offs); anL (vi) satisfactory project
appraisal and supervision capacity for investment projects. The annual audits
of the PCBs would have to include separate opinions by the external auditors
that the PCBs are in compliance with the prudential regulations on loan loss
provisioning, capital adequacy and loan concentration, and have achieved a
positive real return to equity and a minimum collection ratio.

F.  Environmental AsRects
4.19         All sub-borrowers would be required to comply with the
environmental protection regulations of the Government. In appraising
subprojects, the PFIs will be responsible for ensuring that sub-borrowers have
received clearance from the relevant regulatory agencies regarding the
environmental impact of their investments. Sub-borrowers will thus be
required to submit evidence of clearance from the environmental authorities
that environmental concerns identified would be addressed through appropriate
measures. During subproject implementation, the PFIs will review compliance
with environmental regulations and requirements by subprojects in the course
of normal subproject supervision. The PFIs would report and coordinate
regularly with the environmental authorities to help monitor compliance. This
approach to environmental protection by the PFIs is reflected in their policy
and strategy statements.



- 25 ,
V. THE PROPOSED LOAN
A. Amount and Allocation of Funds
5.01        The proposed Bank loan of US$200 million will be made to GOT for
on-lending through eligible PFIs to private enterprises. The Bank loan to GOT
will be made at the Bank's standard variable interest rate and will have a
fixed amortization of 17 years including a grace period of 5 years. The
Government will on-lend the loan funds to the PFIs on the same terms and
conditions as the Bank loan plus an on-lending fee of 0.5%. Each PFI will be
allowed to extend loans to its borrowers for up to 8 years including a grace
period of no more than 3 years in one or more of five currencies (DM, Sf,
Sterling, US$, Yen). The PFIs will carry the cross-currency risk. The PFIs
could manage this risk basically by relending to sub-borrowers in currencies
that reflect the Bank's currency pool. Other risk management tools will have
to supplement this basic approach. In any case, the PFIs will have to comply
with the Central Bank's prudential regulations on foreign exchange risk
exposure.
5.02        Out of the US$200 million loan, US$50 million will be allocated to
TSKB and US$40 million to SYKB through subsidiary loan agreements between the
Government and these institutions that are satisfactory to the Bank. The
balance of US$110 million will be allocated to the PCBs on a first-come-
first-served basis through subsidiary loan agreements as well. Signing of the
subsidiary loan agreements, satisfactory to the Bank, by at least one
development bank and one commercial bank will be a condition of loan
effectiveness. Each PCB would have an initial allocation ceilirg of US$30
million or 100% of its net worth, whichever is lower. These ceilings will be
reviewed from time to time during project implementation and appropriate
adjustments will be made in coordination with GOT and the PCBs. Since the
amount utilized by each PCB would only be known ex-post, the Government will
initially pay the commitment fees on the amount allocated to the PCBs.
However, to enable the Government to recover the commitment fees, each subloan
disbursed to a PCB would carry a one-time commitment fee of 0.75% which would
be paid by the sub-borrower, collected by the PCB and remitted to the
Government. These arrangements were finalized and agreed during loan
negotiations.
B. On-lending Rates and Foreign Exchange Risk
5.03        Foreig-n Exchange Risk Insurance Scheme (FERIS).  The funds under
other Bank projects including IEDP were on-lent in local currency and the
foreign exckange risk was assumed by FERIS. In connection with the
preparation of the proposed Project, the Bank carried out a study of the
viability of FERIS. The study showed not only that improved management of
FERIS would reduce its losses but also that FERIS would continue to incur
losses due to its basic mandate and structure. In October 1990, the
Government decided to abolish FERIS but allow it to wind down until all
committed loans are disbursed. In the meantime, no new resources will be
added to FERIS until December 1992, the end of the current government's
political mandate. The Bank supports the Government's decision to abolish



- 26 -
FERIS since it is highly distortionary. An agreement was reached that should
there be a reversal of this decision, the Bank would have the option of
suspending or cancelling the Project. A revival of FERIS would not only
dampen the demand for loans under the Project, but more importantly, would
perpetuate a major distortion in the credit market.
5.04        In view of the FERIS reform, it is proposed that the sub-loans
under the Project be denominated in foreign currency. The sub-borrower will
be given an option to borrow in a currency of his choice at the prevailing 6-
month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread to be negotiated
with his PFI. Since the Bank loan is based on a currency pool (30% in US$,
30% in Yen, 30% in European currencies and 10% in other currencies) and it is
a targeted pool, it is not possible to ask the sub-borrower to bear the
exchange risk of the pool, which is unknown ex-ante on a subloan by subloan
basis. It is therefore proposed that the sub-borrower be allowed to borrow in
single foreign currencies. Under this arrangement, the Government will on-
lend the Bank funds to the PFIs on the same terms and conditions as the Bank
loan plus an on-lending fee of 0.5%, with the PFIs carry the cross-currency
risk. Based on present market conditions, the cost to the sub-borrower could
be around LIBOR + 2-3 % plus other fees, such as commitment fees, appraisal
fees, etc. Naturally, the willingness of the su,b-borrowers to assume the
foreign exchange risk will depend inter alia on their assessment of the future
value of the TL, and the structure of their assets and liabilities. After the
three-year grace period, the sub-borrower will be given an option to prepay
the subloan to the intermediary without any penalty to reduce this risk. To
make things simple the PFIs may consider limiting the currency option
initially to five currencies (DM, Sf, Sterling, US$, Yen). These arrangements
were agreed with the Government and the PFIs during loan negotiations.
C. Administration
Subloan Size. Free limits and Review procedures
5.05        TSKB. SYKB and VB.  The proposed free limits for TSKB, and SYKB
and Vakiflar Bank (VB) under the project are US$6 million, and US$3 million,
respectivref-. The free limits for TSKB, and SYKB and VB have been increased
from US$5 million and US$2.5 million respectively, to reflect inflation,
exchange rate changes and the expected change in client mix under the proposed
Project. It is expected that about 20 sub-projects would be financed by TSKB,
and 30 by SYKB and VB. The proposed free limits would give the Bank adequate
control on the quality of subproject appraisals and assurance that only
enterprises that meet the agreed eligibility criteria will be financed. The
maximum subloan size per subproject under from a single PFI would be US$8
million. However, when a subproject is financed jointly by several PFIs, the
maximum aggregate subloan under the Project may go up to a maximum amount of
US$20 million equivalent, provided the maximum exposure of each PFI does not
exceed the maximum allowed by the Banking Law, in the case of the PCBs, and
the limits agreed with the Bank, in the case of TSKB (15% of networth) and
SYKB (20% of networth). Currently, there is a single borrower exposure limit
of 10% of net worth and a single group exposure limit of 100% of net worth.
Under consideration is a revision in the regulations to reduce the single



- 27 -
group exposure limit to 50% of net worth. Under the project, the new group
limit would already apply to the PCBs for subprojects financed by Bank funds.
Since the Bank has funds for small and medium-scale enterprises under SMI II,
the minimum subloan size under the Project would be US$500,000, to minimize
overlapping coverage.
5.06        Participating Commercial Banks.  Since, except for VB, the
commercial banks still have limited experience in appraising subproject
proposals, it is proposed that the Bank review each subloan application from
them.  The participating commercial banks would submit their subloan
applications together with the appraisal reports to the Bank.
D. Reporting Reguirements and Audits
5.07        TSKB will be required to submit quarterly progress reports in
formats acceptable to the Bank. These reports will cover TSKB's financial
condition and results, utilization of Bank funds, the achievement of
operational targets, achievement of the agreed operational diversification and
financial restructuring programs, and training. TSKB will also provide
revised financial projections twice a year. TSKB's reporting requirements
were discussed during appraisal and were confirmed during negotiations. SYKB
will continue to provide the same quarterly progress reports as under the
previous loan. However, the coverage will be expanded to include performance
monitoring of its major portfolio problems, its diversification efforts, and
semi-annual financial projections. The PCBs will submit quarterly reports on
the utilization of Bank funds. The report'ng requirements were agreed upon
during negotiations.
5.08        TSKB and SYKB are audited by private external auditors with
international affiliations which are acceptable to the Bank. Audit reports
will continue to be required for submission to the Bank within 150 days of the
close of their financial years. In addition to the financial audit reports,
they will continue to be required to provide long form audits. Both TSKB's
and SYKB's 1989 audit reports were unqualified. The PCBs are audited by
private external auditors with international affiliations which are acceptable
to the Bank and are among the Central Bank-approved auditors. They will
continue to be required to submit their annual financial reports in accordance
with the eligibility criteria no later than 150 days after the close of their
respective financial years. The six PCBs that are already considered eligible
to participate in the Project had clean audits for FY 1989.
E. Procurement and Disbursements
5.09        Goods and services financed under the proposed Project will be
subject to standard procurement procedures for financial intermediation
projects. For contracts below US$5 million, the present commercial practice
of local and international shopping and limited bidding with at least three
quotations will be followed. Project sponsors would seek bids from a list of
potential suppliers broad enough to ensure competitive prices. Sponsors would

required. However, International Competitive Bidding (ICB) would be required
for individual contracts of US$5 million and above except for the following
reasons, with the prior approval by the Bank: (i) for modernization and
expansion subprojects when the equipment or machinery required is standardized
or proprietary; (ii) when there is a limited number of suppliers; and (iii)
for justifiable technical reason. The participating financial institutions
will be required to maintain records of the methods of procurement used for
Bank supervision.
5.10        The proceeds of the Bank loan for the credit component would be
disbursed at the rate of 100% of the CIF cost of machinery and equipment, 70%
of the cost of imported machinery and equipment procured locally (to factor
out taxes and duties paid), and 50% of the ex-factory cost of locally
manufactured machinery and equipment (to capture the foreign cost content).
Special accounts will be established for TSKB, SYKB and the PCBs to facilitate
disbursements. The amounts in the special accounts were agreed with the
Government and the PFIs during negotiations, i.e., a total of US$15 million
for the PCBs and US$5 million each for the TSKB and SYKB. All disbursements
would be on the basis of full documentation due to their large sizes.
5.11        Closing Date.  Based on the pipelines of the participating banks,
it is expected that the credit component of the Project will be committed
within three years and disbursed within five years of Board approval.
Therefore, it is proposed that the last date for submission of sub-loan
applications to the Bank will be December 31, 1994. The closing date of the
loan will be June 30, 1996.
VI. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
6.01        Benefits.  The proposed Project will provide some of the long term
funds needed to expand Turkey's productive capacity to sustain its export
drive. In the transition to a more stable economy, the Bank's assistance will
help the banks develop more capacity to mobilize resources domestically and
prudently perform their term transformation function.
6.02        Based on past experience, the Project is expected to support
private investments in the order of US$400 million and exports of about US$200
million, and result in the creation of about 14,000 new full time jobs. With
a minimum economic rate of return of 15%, all sub-projects financed under the
Project are expected to be efficient and internationally competitive
operations. The Project would continue to promote greater competition among
financial iustitutions and improve their performance. It would continue to
encourage the development of a market-based credit delivery system for
industrial finance that can efficiently mobilize and allocate long term
resources.
6.03        Risks.  The potential project risks would stem from:  (i) a slow
down in private investment due to deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and a
change in the investmert climate; (ii) a change in relative prices due to a
reversal of trade liberalization policies; and (iii) a reluctance by Turkish



- 29
investors to assume foreign exchange risk in unstable economic conditions.
The Government, however, has made macroeconomic stabilization as a primary
policy objective and fiscal policy is expected to be aligned with the
restrictive monetary policy of the Central Bank not only as a central anti-
inflationary tool but also as a signal to the markets. It is also the
announced Government policy to continue to liberalize imports, maintain a
realistic exchange rate policy, promote exports and rationalize the industrial
incentive framework to promote greater efficiency. Should these policies be
reversed to an extent that the Project's viability is jeopardized, there could
be a suspension or cancellation of the Project in the context of a
reconfiguration of the Bank's overall relationship with Turkey.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01        During negotiations, agreements with the Government and the PFIs
were reached Gn the following:
(a)   Abolition of FERIS and option by the Bank to suspend or cancel the
Project should there be a reversal of this decision (para. 5.03);
(b)   Allocation of funds (US$50 million for TSKB, US$40 million for
SYKB and US$110 million for PCBs on a first-come-first-served
basis) (para. 5.02);
(c)   On-lending by GOT of the amounts allocated to TSKB, SYKB and the
PCBs by means of satisfactory subsidiary loan agreements. Signing
of satisfactory subsidiary loan agreements between GOT and at
least one development bank and one commercial bank would be a
condition of loan effectiveness (para. 5.02);
(d)   The participation conditions for the TSKB (para. 4.12);
(e)   The participation conditions for SYKB  (para. 4.15);
(f)   The participation conditions for PCBs (para. 4.18);
(g)   On-lending rates and foreign exchange risk (para. 5.04);
(h)   Sub-project eligibility criteria (para. 4.06);
(i)   Reporting and auditing requirements for TSKB, SYKB and the PCBs
(paras. 5.07-5.08);
(j)   The amounts in the Special Accounts (para. 5.10).
7.02        Agreement was reached with the Government and the PFIs that the
maximum subloan size for a subproject from a single PFI would be US$8 million.
However, when a subproject is financed jointly by several PFIs, the aggregate
subloan amounts under the Project may go up to a maximum of US$20 million,
provided that in no case can the maximum exposure of any PFI exceed the limits



- 30 -
required under the Banking Law, in the case of the PCBs, and the limits agreed
with the Bank, in the case of TSKB and SYKB. The minimum subloan size per
subproject would be US$500,000, to minimize overlap with the Second SMI Loan
(para. 5.05).
7.03        Agreement was reached with the Government that the initial
allocation to a PCB would be a maximum of US$30 million or 100% of equity of
the PCB whichever is less unless otherwise agreed by the Bank (para. 5.02).
7.04        Agreement was reached that sub-borrowers would be allowed to
prepay their subloans at any time after the grace period of three years
without a penalty (para. 5.04).
7.05        The proposed Project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank Loan
of US$200 million at the standard variable interest rate for a period of 17
years including 5 years of grace for the Government of Turkey, under
conditions outlined in Chapter V.

PRIVATE INVESTMENT CREDIT PROJECT
ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE INDUSTRIAL EXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LN.2901-TU)
Summary
1.          The US$298.5 million loan for private export-oriented investment
projects became effective in January 1988 and was fully committed by mid-
1989, two years ahead of schedule. Originally designed to contribute to the
financing of a total of around US$600 million in sub-project investments, the
loan actually facilitated total investments in excess of US$2 billion, with
incremental export sales from the sub-projects projected at around US$500
million and total sales at US$1 billion. Sub-projects had an average
projected internal economic rate of return (IERR) of 391, well above 151
minimum IERR set for sub-project eligibility. The high average IERR and high
ratio of total incremental sales to total investment stem largely from the
fact that many of the sub-projects involved the expansion or balancing of
existing manufacturing facilities rather than the establishment of new
facilities.
Description of Project
2.          The Industrial Export Development Project (IEDP) was designed to
support Turkey's drive to expand exports. It consisted of a credit component
of US$298.5 million and a technical assistance component of US$1.5 million.
The project was implemented by two private development banks (TSKB) and SYKB),
eight major private commercial banks. At the time of appraisal, it was
projected that the Bank line of credit along with other loans and equity
contributions would finance eligible sub-projects with a total investment cost
of around US$600 million. Eligible sub-projects were expected to export at
least 20% of incremental production within 3 to 5 years after start-up and
generate a minimum economic rate of return of 151 in real terms. The loan
became effective in January 1988. At the time of appraisal, it was projected
that the loan would be fully disbursed by 1992.
Preliminary Results of Project
3.          The June 1990 data on the implementation of the project show that
the project had already far exceeded initial expectations. Already by mid-
1989 funds were fully committed. Though a number of sub-projects are at the
implementation or start-up stage, as of June 1990 the project had assisted in
financing over US$2 billion in eligible investments. Incremental sales as a
result of these investments are estimated at around US$1 billion per year and
incremental exports are projected to be around 50% of this amount or US$500
million per year. The weighted average economic rate of return for the sub-
projects was estimated at 39% which is higher than appraisal estimates.



- 32 -
4.          Sub-project Financing.  As shown by the table in Annex 1.1, 115
sub-loans were financed using US$248 million from the line of credit. It is
noteworthy that the sub-project sponsors had strong balance sheets with an
average debt:equity ratio of 28:72. Equity contribution amounted to around
US$980 million or 472 of the total cost of these sub-projects (see also Annex
1.2). Furthermore, resources mobilized from other sources were three times
the amount of the Bank sub-loans.
5.          Sub-sectoral Distribution of Sub-projects and Investments.  From
Annex 1.2 it can be seen the textile sub-sector accounted for roughly 40% of
the number of sub-projects and 441 of total sub-project investments. The
rubber sub-sector, which accounted for only 4% of the sub-projects,
represented almost 24X of total investments. Other major sub-sectors included
glass manufacturing (10 of sub-projects and 7X of total investments) and
tourism (10% of sub-projects and 13% of total investments). Thus, four sub-
sectors accounted for 64% of all sub-projects and 882 of total investment.
6.          Export by Destination.  From Annex 1.4, it can be noted that EEC,
with 47% of total exports, is the most important export market of the sub-
projects financed under the project. The Middle East, with 222 of total
exports, is the second most important market.
