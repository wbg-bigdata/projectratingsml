TO TllE IXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO TiE
iOVERN4EN,"T OF INDIA
FOR AN ASRICULTURAL AVIATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$ 6 million to India.
PART I - AISTORICAL
2.        Since 1919 the Bank and thie Association hiave provided assistance
totallinrg US$ 206 million to finance agricultural projects in India,
including tnree loans amounting to US$ 31 million and ten credits amounting
to US$ 175 million.  The last of these, signed on June 24, 1970, was the
Punjab Agricultural Credit Project to assist in the financing of farm mecha-
nization. Lending for agriculture llow accounts for 10% of total Bark Group
lending in India and the proportion is likely to increase.
3.        Tne proposed credit would finance the foreign exchange costs of
an agricultural aviation project aiming at better control of crop pests and
diseases through the expansion and improvement of aerial spraying services
throughout India. It is the first Bank Group project the main purpose of
which is to provide plant protection through aerial spraying.
b.        The project was appraised in November 1969 and negotiations for
the proposed credit were completed on September 11, 1970. The Borrower was
represented by Mr. S.M.H. Burney (Joint Secretary) and Group Captain Sen
(Director of the Agricultural Aviation Unit) from the Department of Agriculture;
and the Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC) was represented by
Mr. P.N. Damry (Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India).

6.        There have been delays in several projects in India.   IJo
disbursements have yet been made on the loan for the Tarai Seeds Project
(loan No. 61)1-IN), due largely to the time taken in organizing the Tarai
Development Corporation.  However, orders for equipment have now been placed,
aiid L expect disbursements to begii fairly sooii. Do far as tiie two loais
to Indian Iron and Steel Company are concerned, the Closing Date for the
collieries loan (No.307-IN) has been postponed, as recommended in my memo-
randum of July 9, 1970 (R70-135) while disbursements remain suspended in
respect of the balancing scheme (Loan No. L56-ITl); a mission is in India
discussing the second of these loans with the Government and the Company.
Another mission will visit India towards the end of the year to study the
progress at the Beas Project (Credit No. 87-IN) and to make recommendations
with a view to expediting disbursements.
7.        since 1959, IFC has made thirteen commitments in India totalling
$!p12.3 million, of which $3l.2 million represent loans and $8.1 million equity.
As of August 31, 1970, $19.l1 million of the total had been disbursed and
$6.0 million cancelled leaving $16.9 million undisbursed.   The largest
commitment is a total of $18.9 million to Zuari Agro-Chemicals for a fertil-
:izer plant in Goa. A number of other industrial schemes are currently under
consideration.
8.        Appraisal reports have been prepared for the Andhra Pradesh
Agricultuiral Credit, Grain Storage, Cauvery Delta Ir-rigation and Second Power
Transrrmission projects. A number of other projects are also being prepared.

FARi 'I1l - -ThiE PROJECT
10.       An appraisal report entitled 'Agricult.ural Aviation Project: Tndia`
(PA-58) is attached.
11.       The higher priority given to agriculture in India's development
strategy since 1965, including the major efforts made to introduce new
technology by increasing the availability of inputs, encouraging the adoption
of new, fertilizer-responsive varieties of food grains and providing economic
incentives for increased production have resulted in an increased groti-i
rate above the long term trend in thlis sector. However, with the introduction
of high-yielding crop varieties, the problems of pest control have increased;
there is more for the pests to eat and the new varieties are more susceptible
to adverse environmental conditions and diseases. There is a growing
realization that without improved pest control much of the benefit from
investment made to achieve increased yields could be lost. As mentioned in
Section 3.02 of the appraisal report the ecological ramifications of the
use of pesticides - particularly D.D.T. - for aerial application have been
much discussed in India and the use of D.D.T. under the project will be
severely restricted. The Government has also given assurances that the
handling of pesticides will be regulated carefully to minimize the environ-
mental hazards.
12.       The proposed project would support a program of aerial spraying
which began in 1957 when 00I set up an Aviation Unit as part of the
Directorate of Plant Protection (within the Ministry of Agriculture) and
would complement other IDA assistance to India in the agricultural sector.
It would form an important part of India's plant protection program for the
current Five-Year Plan period (1969-1974), by providing finance for the
foreign exchange costs of (a) about 82 agricultural aircraft (67 for the
use of qualified private operators and 15 for the GOI Directorate of



- 5 -
Agricultural Aviation); (b) spare parts and ancillary equipment; and
(c) training agricultural pilots and engineers. Purchase of aircraft by
private operators would be through a credit program to be run by ARC.
13.       Total project cost is estimated to be US$ 8.8 million equivalent;
the foreign exchange cost of US$ 6 million would be financed by the proceeds
of the proposed credit. Of this amount, US$ 3.3 million would be allocated
to the ARC at a rate of not less than 5½ percent per annum for eleven years
(including a four-year grace period) to be used for extending credit to the
PCBs at a rate of not less than 7 percent; PCBs in turn would make individual
loans to private operators at the prevailing commercial rate but at not less
than 8%Z percent; US$ 1.7 million would cover the foreign exchange cost of
insurance to provide for replacement of any project aircraft lost by private
operators and for import of spare parts by authorized dealers; and the balance
of US$ 1 million would cover the foreign exchange cost of DAA acquiring new
aircraft and establishing a training program.
1L.       The use of IDA funds to finance the foreign exchange cost of
insuring private operators' aircraft is an unusual feature. Because of the
inherent danger in low level aerial spraying, the rate of loss of aircraft
is likely to be high, particularly in the initial years. Based on expected
attrition rates, spraying capacity would decrease by 10-15 percent per annum
unless replacements are provided promptly.  No agricultural aircraft are
presently manufactured in India. There is accordingly a large foreign exchange
component in the cost of replacement and repair of damaged aircraft. In the
particular circumstances of this project, the Association would finance the
foreigrn exchange component of the insurance premiuns payable by the private
operators for the three-year period of implementation of the project.   Provision
is also included for the replacement of any DAA aircraft which may be lost
during the three-year period.
15.       Two helicopter and eight fixed-wing aircraft rmanufacturers from
four Bank member countries have well. established dealerships and mainternance
facilities in India.  Local competition among thiese is satisfactory and normal
trade channels are expected to be effective in meetirvc private operators'
preferences for agricultural aircraft proven suitable for Indian conditions.
G01 has indicated that it would be prepared to consider new dealerships for
makes of aircraft which had substantial operating or cost advantages over
makes presently being sold in India. The requirements of each private
operator differs and it is necessary that expansion and replacement of
private operator-owned aircraft be compatible with an individual's existing
fleet. In the case of DAA aircraft it is important that DAA should be able
to choose several types of aircraft for purposes of training and experimentation.
The procurement arrangements proposed are well suited to the nature of the
project and allow for adequate international competition in accordance with
the "Guidelines".
16.       Benefits from the project would arise from increased agricultural
production, thus reducirng India's import requirements.  Gross foreign exchange
savings at full development w.ould be at least US$ 1.'3 million annually.  Tle
r:nor'Omc rat;e of return is expectend .cj exceed 100 percent.  The incremental
sciconme resul.t.ing from tVi sUrCc53fui. operation of the Project would accrtizu

mainly to small-scale farmers for whom this project was specifically
designed. When the program was started a few years ago aerial spraying was
heavily subsidized. As a result of the enthusiastic reception given to
aerial plant protection by farmers, a number of States have already dis-
continued subsidies for pesticides and aerial application costs. Both the
Central and State governments are aware of the need to reduce subsidies in
the agricultural sector.
PART IV - LEGAL II'NSTRUMENTS AND AUTHIORITY
