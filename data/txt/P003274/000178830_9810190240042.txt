1
Amount                                   US$105.0 Million, including front-end
fee.
Terms                                     11.60 percent interest payable in 20
years, including 5 years of grace.
Purpose                                : The proposed loan would increase elec-
tricity generating capacity by helping
finance construction of two 220 MW
units at the Hwange Thermal Power Sta-
tion and a transmission line. In ad-
dition, the loan would finance engin-
eering consulting services, electri-
city tariff structure and energy pric-
ing study. The project would enable
Zimbabwe to meet the power demand up
to the end of 1986.
Manpower shortages could delay project
implementation. The risk is minimized
however, by providing for technical
assistance in the project and
execution of a manpower plan.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY COMMISSION
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF ZIMBABWE
FOR A POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Electricity Supply Commission (ESC) with the guarantee of the
Government of the Republic of Zimbabwe for US$105.0 million at 11.60
percent interest, payable in 20 years, including five years grace to help
finance a Power Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1
2.        The first Bank economic mission to independent Zimbabwe visited
the country in September 1980, after which a Country Economic Memorandum
(Report Number 3234-ZIM) was distributed to the Executive Directors in
April 1981. This description is based on that memorandum and on
information obtained on subsequent missions.
3.        Zimbabwe is a landlocked country of about 390,000 sq km, bordered
by Mozambique on the east, Botswana on the southwest, Zambia on the north-
west, and South Africa on the south. The population as of December 1981,
was estimated to be 7.7 million, 97 percent of whom are Africans. 2 The
remainder consists of about 170,000 Europeans, 10,000 Asians and 23,000
people of mixed origin. The growth rate of the African population is es-
timated to be about 3.4 percent per year. The number of Europeans has been
declining due to emigration, which has recently been occurring at an aver-
age rate of about 1,700 persons per month. According to estimates based on
pre-war data, 20 percent of the population is urban but this is almost
certain to understate the present extent of urbanization.
4.        In 1980, per capita income was Z$470 (US$630, using the World
Bank Atlas methodology). Estimates for 1981 suggest that real per capita
I
1 Essentially the same as President's Report No. P-3304-ZIM.
2 The Government of Zimbabwe's nomenclature for population divisions is used
throughout. The first census since 1969 took place in August 1982.



- 2 -
income grew at about 4.6 percent, giving a 1981 figure of slightly under
Z$500 per person. In spite of this good growth performance, distribution
of income and assets between Africans and non-Africans remains highly
skewed. The Land Tenure Act of 1969 updated legislation of the 1930s and
confirmed division of the country's total land area into roughly two equal
parts for European and African settlement, the Europeans possessing most of
the best land. Given the difference between the size of the two groups,
the division resulted in an allocation at independence of approximately 2.5
ha per African and 65.2 ha per non-African. The degree of disparity will
begin to change now that majority rule has been achieved, but similar dis-
parities exist in the distribution of other productive assets and income.                 -
Rough estimates made in 1979 of the differences in per capita income sug-
gest that the average per capita income for Africans was about Z$110
(US$175) compared with roughly Z$5,500 (US$9,000) for non-Africans.
5.        Following the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in
1965, the international community imposed economic sanctions and, in 1973,
a costly guerrilla war started. The sanctions were only partly effective.
Between 1965, when they began, and 1974, real GDP grew at about 7 percent
per year and per capita income at about 3.5 percent. Exports expanded,
enhancing the country-s ability to import. Notably, the sanctions
stimulated development of local import substitution capacity, so that by
1979 consumer goods were only about 10 percent of total imports, compared
with 22 percent in 1964. Sanctions also encouraged the diversification of
commercial agriculture and the rapid growth of investment in and exports
from the mining sector.
6.        However, the economic situation changed for the worse between
1975 and 1979. The added effect of the guerrilla war, increases in the oil
price and two droughts caused economic activity to decline, so that per
capita income in real terms fell by 35 percent to its 1965 level. While
the value of exports rose slightly even during this period, the dramatic
Increase in the cost of imports, in particular oil, caused the volume of
imports to fall precipitously. Real investment and formal employment also
declined significantly.
7.        Despite these setbacks, the new Government inherited a well-
diversified economy with good potential for growth. Agriculture, manufact-
uring and mining are all important, contributing 14 percent, 8 percent, and
24 percent, respectively, of GDP in 1980, and together providing 52 percent
of total formal employment. Agriculture accounts for more than 300,000
jobs or 35 percent of the total; manufacturing for 167,000 jobs and mining
for 70,000.  Most of the remaining formal employment is provided by service
sectors such as public administration, education and, in particular, domes-
tic service. Mining and agriculture earn significant amounts of foreign
exchange and supply most inputs for manufacturing, which in turn accounts
for between 20 and 25 percent of Zimbabwe's merchandize exports, mainly
processed agricultural and mineral items.



- 3 -
8.         Since independence, the economy has rebounded strongly as resump-
tion of normal economic activity has been accompanied by an improvement in
the terms of trade and expansion of external borrowing. Imports increased
by 47 percent in 1980 and by 26 percent in 1981, facilitating increases in
capacity utilization. Growth has been extremely strong in agriculture,
which has benefitted from good weather. Consequently, overall real growth
of the economy was about 8 to 10 percent in 1980, while early estimates
suggest a rate of seven to nine percent for 1981.
9.         The substantial increase in imports in 1980-81 was financed with
reserve drawdowns and short-term borrowings. This increase in imports and
short-term borrowing, coupled with a slower than required rate of growth of
exports, have resulted in a very serious balance of payments situation.
100        Some short- and long-run problems must be addressed if the coun-
try is to experience more equitably distributed growth. The major short-
run problem is controlling domestic demand so as to reduce inflation (cur-
rently about 15 percent per year). Some needed policies are already being
implemented. Sales and import taxes and interest rates have all been rais-
ed. The rate of expansion of the money supply was reduced from 22 percent
in 1980 to 15 percent in 1981. The overall budget deficit as a percent of
GDP has declined from its high of 14 percent in 1979/80. However, further
reductions must be accomplished during the current (1982/83) budgetary
exercise if stabilization efforts are to fully succeed. Significant
longer-term problems concern the need to increase the level and quality of
investment, to expand domestic savings, and to adopt a wage policy
consistent with the need to increase employment. Although these issues are
interrelated, the Government recognizes that increasing employment and
labor productivity are key to achieving its aim of growth with equity.
Unfortunately, the recent increase in wage minima, the third such increase
since independence, and the announcement that further revisions are likely
is inconsistent with the employment goal.
11.        Should Government effectively deal with the above-mentioned prob-
lems, prospects for respectable growth and more equitable distribution of
income are quite good. Real increases in GDP could well average 5.5 per-
cent per year in 1980-85. Thereafter, growth could slow, perhaps, to an
average of four percent per year, as investments are made in longer-
gestating programs with a more even distribution of assets. Much of the
burden of achieving growth and equity goals must fall on the agricultural
sector. In the past, the commercial farms accounted for most agricultural
production.  However, the development of smallholder agriculture has been
assigned the highest priority.
12.        Zimbabwe emerged from 15 years of sanctions and the war with
relatively low external indebtedness. In September 1981, foreign debt
totalled Z$493 million (US$715 million equivalent) and the country's gross
international reserves equalled about Z$150 million, or an estimated two
months of imports. The external debt figure was equivalent to US$90 per
capita or about 15 percent of estimated GDP. The debt service ratio, which



- 4 -
was about four percent in 1980, is estimated to have risen to 7 and 15 per-
cent in 1981 and 1982, respectively. This rapid rise reflects the fact
that nearly all Zimbabwe's present debt must be repaid in the next six
years which will exert pressures on the short-term balance of payments sit-
uation. However, so long as the country avoids recourse to large amounts
of short-term commercial borrowing, the debt service ratios should begin to
decline after 1984 even with large amounts of additional external borrow-
ing. In light of this and the country's potential for growth and expan-
sion, Zimbabwe is creditworthy for Bank lending.  However, given the coun-
try's massive external resource requirements for the next few years and the
expected high level of international interest rates and relatively hard re-
payment terms of non-concessional borrowing, it is clear that Zimbabwe
needs to receive part of its external assistance on concessionary terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
13.       Before 1965, the Bank made five loans totalling US$140.3 million
benefitting Rhodesia -- two directly to the Government for agriculture
(US$5.6 million) and power (US$28.0 million), two loans totalling
US$87.7 million to the Central African Power Corporation (CAPCO), and a
US$9 million loan to the Rhodesia Railways. As a guarantor of each of the
loans, the United Kingdom serviced them after 1964. The loans for agricul-
ture, railways and one for power have been repaid. CAPCO is servicing its
second power loan. During FY81, the Bank and the Association approved a
loan of US$50 million and a credit of US$15 million for the Manufacturing
Rehabilitation Imports Program. The loan (1959-ZIM) and the credit (1120-
ZIM) financed priority import requirements of raw materials, spare parts,
and components and balancing equipment needed to utilize idle capacity in
the manufacturing sector. The Bank also approved a loan (1944-ZIM) of
US$42 million to finance import requirements of spare parts, track mainten-
ance equipment and tools for the railways, equipment for the Central Mech-
anical Equipment Department and technical assistance. A Small Farm Credit
Project to provide the Agricultural Finance Corporation with funds for sea-
sonal loans and for medium- and long-term loans for equipment and farm im-
provments, as well as technical assistance and a Petroleum Fuels Supply
Technical Assistance project to select the optimum system of supplying
petroleum fuels, were approved in September 1982.
14.       IFC's first investment in Zimbabwe, approved by its Board in
March 1981, was in the Hwange Colliery Company Limited to help finance a
project to produce coal for a thermal power station presently under
construction and other uses.  The investment was in the form of a US$38
million loan (552-ZIM), of which US$20 million was for IFC's own account
and US$18 million comprised commercial bank participation in the loan. IFC
was also responsible for arranging a further US$10.3 million of commercial
bank financing related to a proposed loan by the Export-Import Bank of the
United States (Eximbank).



15.       The Bank is identifying and preparing projects in agriculture and
rural and forestry development, power, railways development, manpower de-
velopment and training and industrial intermediation. A highway project,
which includes constructing about 400 km of rural roads in the communal
areas plus a pilot feeder road program is scheduled for Board presentation
in February 1983, and a forestry project designed to support rural affores-
tation was appraised in May 1982. The Bank has reviewed the energy, agri-
cultural, urban, education and manpower, population, health and nutrition,
and telecommunications sectors, for which reports either have been com-
pleted or are being written. Disbursements in Zimbabwe have kept to sched-
ule.
PART III - THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTOR
16.       Zimbabwe's main indigenous energy resources are hydropower, coal
and wood fuel. All petroleum products are currently imported and geologi-
cal information on the country indicates that discovery of petroleum is un-
likely. However, ethanol, produced from sugar, blended with gasoline meets
about 13 percent of the country's gasoline requirements. Some potential
exists for development of solar and wind energy.
17.       Hydro-electricity.  The Zambezi, which forms Zimbabwe's northern
border, is the only river whose hydroelectric potential has been defined
and is estimated at a total of 36,900 GWh (9.3 million toe) annually, of
which 10,600 GWh (2.7 million toe) has already been exploited. In 1980,
the Kariba hydro complex, which is located on the river, contributed
70 percent of the electrical energy requirements of the country. The
Zambezi hydropower, which Zimbabwe shares with Zambia, is expected to be
fully exploited by about 2010.
18.       Coal.  Zimbabwe is well endowed with coal (29 billion tonnes) and
has made good use of it for railways, power generation, steel production,
tobacco processing, tea curing and other activities. About 2.2 billion
tons or 7.5 percent are classified as proven recoverable reserves. Current
coal production is about 3.2 million tonnes per annum or about 2.1 million
toe. Coal now supplies about 32 percent of the country's total energy re-
quirements and is expected to supply 46 percent by the year 2000.  Mean-
while, the Government has accepted the Bank's recommendation that a study
be undertaken to determine the optimal use of coal resources. The study is
i           already underway and is being financed by the EEC.



-6-
19.       Fuelwood.  Wood is the most important source of energy for both
rural and urban households, supplying about 28 percent of Zimbabwe's total
energy demand. It meets nearly all the fuel requirements of the rural pop-
ulation and the urban poor and a substantial proportion of the agricultural
energy needs, particularly for tobacco curing and tea processing.
Zimbabwe's indigenous woodlands are, however, an uncertain resource, espec-
ially in several eastern settlements and around the main urban areas where
they have been depleted to a critical level. The Government is encouraging
an afforestation program based on communal woodlots, and the Bank is con-
sidering supporting these efforts with a fuelwood project (para. 15).
20.       Petroleum.  Refined petroleum products have been imported from
South Africa since 1966 when the pipeline from Beira in Mozambique to the
Feruka Refinery in Mutare (formerly Umtali) was closed -- due to the block-
ade of crude oil supplies -- following UDI. Thereafter, petroleum imports
fell by an average annual rate of 2.9 percent as a proportion of total
energy so that they supplied only 11.5 percent of energy requirements in
1980 -- a small proportion when compared to other countries. The Govern-
ment shortly will undertake a study with Bank assistance, to identify and
evaluate Zimbabwe's options and determine the least-cost system of tran-
shipping petroleum fuels imports into the country (para. 13).
Solar and Wind Energy
21.       There is potential for using both solar and wind energy.  Govern-
ment interest in both forms of energy has resulted in the manufacture of
solar water heaters and use of wind pumps. Whereas the Government proposes
testing the possibility of promoting the use of wind pumps, solar energy is
deemed to have limited commercial use in Zimbabwe.
Energy Consumption
22.       The large industrial and commercial agriculture sectors make
Zimbabwe a relatively high energy consuming country (about 5.28 barrels of
oil equivalent -- boe -- per capita in 1980). Total energy consumption
amounted to 5,874 thousand toe or 38.9 million boe in 1980. Indigenous
sources (coal, wood, hydropower and ethanol) satisfy most of the energy
demand, so that imported energy is less than in many developing countries.
Nevertheless, 23 percent of energy was imported in 1980, of which 11.5 per-
cent was electricity and 11.5 percent petroleum products at a cost of
22.6 percent of Zimbabwe's total export earnings.
Energy Pricing
23.       A comprehensive study of all energy prices is required as these
were distorted by war considerations and past policies that may not now ap-
ply. The study would assist the Government in devising national energy



-7-
policies and plans to make a more efficient use of the country's energy re-
sources. The Government has agreed to carry out an energy pricing study
covering petroleum, coal, electricity and wood-fuel, to be completed by
June 30, 1984, and its recommendations implemented by July 1, 1985, (draft
Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.01). The study would inter alia evaluate
the marginal cost of supplying different categories of electricity
customers, and recommend a revised tariff structure based on marginal
costs, social and revenue considerations.
Energy Planning
24.       A strong and properly organized energy planning mechanism is
clearly needed. The Bank has recommended the establishment of such capa-
bility in MIED to improve coordination between various ministries and
departments on overall energy matters.
Power Subsector - Existing Facilities
25.       In FY81, Zimbabwe's total effective installed capacity was 1,051
MW of which 633 MW was hydro (60 percent) and the remaining 418 MW, thermal
(40 percent). Although the installed hydro capacity was only 60 percent of
the total, most of the energy generation was hydro-based; 93 percent was
hydro and only 7 percent was thermal in FY81. The only hydroelectric power
station is the Kariba South Station with an installed capacity of 666 MW.
In addition to the Zimbabwe coal-fired stations at Umniati (120 MW), Harare
(135 MW), Bulawayo (120MW), and the closed Mutare (16.5 MW) and Shabani
(27.5 MW) stations, there are small power stations at mines and sugar
estates burning coal or bagasse. The small plants account for only about
5 percent of installed capacity, and generated about 4 percent of total
energy in FY81.
26.       The transmission network consists of overhead transmission lines
and substations operated at 330, 132, 88 and 66 kV which interconnect all
main load centers. The 330 kV network is predominantly radial in configur-
ation with a "backbone" crossing the country north to south, and has proven
to be a stable system.
27.       Zimbabwe's power consumption was 7,147 GWh in FY81.  The importa-
tion of electricity from Zambia has been a major element in the power and
energy balance of Zimbabwe and it is expected to remain so for at least the
next ten years. During FY81, Zimbabwe imported from Zambia 2,320 GWh or
31 percent of total requirements.
Organization of the Power Subsector
28.       The power subsector which is controlled by the Ministry of Indus-
try and Energy Development (MIED) comprises the publicly owned Central
African Power Corporation (CAPC), jointly owned with the Government of
Zambia, the Electricity Council, the Electricity Supply Commission (ESC)
and the electricity departments of Harare (HMED), Bulawayo (BMED), Mutare



-8-
and Gweru. The Government realises that the fragmented sector needs re-
organization which however must await the recommendation of the panel of
experts who will look at CAPC (para. 32). Meanwhile, in order to consoli-
date utility plans, financial forecasts, resource gathering and distribu-
tion, the Government has agreed that ESC or another power sector utility
will become the central focus in the power sector (draft Guarantee Agree-
ment, Section 4.03). Although reorganization of the sector is necessary,
the utilities operate efficiently with MIED coordinating policy among
them. Planning is not yet fully coordinated however, although MIED has
addressed the problem by creating a planning unit in the Ministry. The
unit requires reinforcement and Government will by December 31, 1982,
strengthen the power sector planning division in MIED by the appointment of
a qualified and experienced power sector planner (draft Guarantee
Agreement, Section 4.02).
29.       When Government has decided on the future organization of the
sector, a planning and construction department may need to be established
in ESC or its successor either to absorb or complement the sector planning
unit in MIED.
Central African Power Corporation (CAPC)
30.       CAPC was established by an Order-in-Council of the United King-
dom, dated December 20, 1963, and derives its powers from this Order and
from identical legislation enacted in the then Territory of Northern
Rhodesia and the then Colony of Southern Rhodesia. The CAPC, now owned
jointly with the Government of Zambia, is a modern public utility with a
high degree of autonomy and powers to establish bulk power tariffs in
Zimbabwe. It owns and operates the Kariba Complex including the dam, the
Kariba South Station, the 330-KV high voltage transmission network in both
countries, but does not own the Kariba North Station which is owned by the
Kariba North Bank Corporation (KNBC), a Zambian corporation. It is empow-
ered inter alia to direct the operation of other publicly-owned generating
stations connected to its transmission system in the two countries to en-
sure that available generating capacity is efficiently utilized. CAPC's
governing body is the Higher Authority for Power (HAP) whose functions are
described below.
31.       CAPC operates all the bulk power grid in both countries from a
control station located at Sherwood in Zimbabwe.  The Sherwood Center, in
addition to the Kariba complex, also determines the operational parameters
and controls: (i) in Zimbabwe, the generation from the Umniati, Harare and
Bulawayo power stations, owned and operated by ESC, HMED and BMED, respect-
ively; in Zambia, the generation from the thermal power stations owned and
operated by the Copperbelt Power Company (CPC), and the Kafue and Victoria
Falls hydroelectric stations, owned and operated by the Zambia Electricity
Supply Corporation (ZESCO); (iii) the importation of power from Zambia to
Zimbabwe; and (iv) the exchange of power between Zambia and Zaire.
32.       Higher Authority for Power.  HAP, which was established to safe-
guard the interests of Zambia and Southern Rhodesia when the Rhodesia and



- 9 -
Nyasaland Federation was dissolved, controls and directs CAPC's policy.
Its four members, two Government ministers from each country, must come to
unanimous decisions. The Order-In-Council establishing HAP provides for
arbitration in case of a deadlock. At HAP's meeting in February 1982, the
first since the re-establishment of the legal government in Zimbabwe in
1979, it was decided to establish a panel of experts, consisting of repre-
sentatives of both countries to undertake a review of the current and fu-
ture status of CAPC.  However, to date, no progress has been made in this
regard.
33.       The Electricity Council.  The Electricity Council, created by the
Electricity Act of 1956, has a maximum of five members, appointed by the
responsible Minister, with responsibilities to advise him on all electri-
city matters of interest to consumers, including franchises and tariffs.
34.       Electricity Supply Commission.  ESC (the proposed borrower) is a
modern and well-managed government-owned utility, with a considerable de-
gree of autonomy, responsible for the construction and operation of facili-
ties generating, transmitting and distributing power required by Zimbabwe.
ESC has progressively taken over many small utilities, both private and
municipal; a process which accelerated following completion of the Kariba
Hydro Scheme in 1960. ESC's present franchise area excludes the licensed
areas of Bulawayo, Gweru, Harare and Mutare.
35.       ESC's executive body consists of the General Manager and five
other members, appointed by the responsible Minister, currently the Minis-
ter for Industry and Energy Development. ESC's staff are competent with
many years of experience.
Municipal Electricity Departments
36.       The Municipal Electricity Departments of the cities of Harare and
Bulawayo purchase all their electric power requirements from CAPC, while
the Mutare and Gweru Electricity Departments purchase their required power
from ESC. During FY81, the Municipal Departments distributed about 2,200
GWh to about 128,000 consumers compared to ESC which distributed about
4,900 GWh to about 52,000 consumers.
Manpower and Training
37.       The power sector is increasingly vulnerable because of the exodus
of skilled white Zimbabweans. All the utility companies, until now, have
relied mainly on white engineers, technicians and artisans trained at tech-
nical colleges in Harare and in Bulawayo, which are also losing staff. The
University of Zimbabwe, which graduated only seven engineers in 1981, fore-
casts 12 graduates in 1982 and 36 in 1983. Canada, France and Sweden have
offered training assistance. In addition, the proposed project will also
address this problem (para. 55).

Past and Current Financial Position
38.       CAPC and the Zimbabwe power utilities are financially interdepen-
dent. Each, supported by Government policies and efficient management,
historically has enjoyed strong financial positions. Tariffs were increas-
ed when required to offset the impact of inflation on operating costs al-
though depreciation and debt service were based on historic costs. How-
ever, tariffs will have to be increased in order to generate adequate funds
for financing the planned sectoral development program.
39.       ESC in the past has, from its own internal cash generation, sub-
stantially contributed to development. Its contribution to construction
was 80 percent in FY79, when capital expenditure was Z$10 million
(US$15 million), but fell to 26 percent in FY80 when construction of the
Hwange I Power station had begun and capital expenditure was Z$42 million
(US$61 million).
40.       Audited accounts for FY81 show that ESC is financially sound.
Outstanding accounts for electricity sales were equivalent to about 40 days
billing, the debt/equity ratio was slightly high at 65:35 because ESC is
constructing the Hwange II plant.
41.       With the proposed project, ESC's debt/equity ratio is expected to
reach a maximum of 55:45 in FY83, but thereafter would fall to 28:72 by
FY91. ESC has agreed that the Bank's concurrence would be obtained (i) for
any borrowing that would raise the debt/equity ratio above 60:40 (draft
Loan Agreement, Section 5.05(b)); and (ii) to any short-term borrowing that
would increase total short-term debt above 10 percent of total debt (draft
Loan Agreement, Section 5.05(a)).
Sector Financing
42.       The additional generation, transmission and distribution capacity
that Zimbabwe expects to construct through 1991, is estimated to cost about
US$5.8 billion in 1982 prices, including interest during construction. To
finance this outlay, the Government plans to borrow about US$3.3 billion
(58 percent) abroad, and US$0.6 billion locally. US$1.9 billion would come
from the Zimbabwe power sector itself. During negotiations, Government
agreed that tariff levels would be so fixed and other necessary steps
taken, for the sector to self finance annually, 30 percent for FY84, 50
percent for FY85 and 30 percent for FY86 and thereafter of sector
construction expenditures (draft Guarantee Agreement, Section 4.06).
Tariffs
43.       Based on average net fixed assets in operation revalued from
1972, the year prior to the fuel crisis after which inflation accelerated,
rates of return for FY81 for ESC and CAPC, respectively, were 5.1 percent
and 5.7 percent -- low rates which indicate that existing bulk and retail
tariff levels are below the marginal cost of electricity.



- 11 -
44.       Power tariffs in Zimbabwe are among the lowest in the world, the
average retail selling price per kWh for FY81 being US$0.0242 equivalent.
ESC tariff levels are lower than in the cities, reflecting the contribution
to municipal revenues incorporated in the city tariffs and the fact that
ESC has a few industrial consumers with very high demands. Tariffs were
increased by about 20 percent in January 1982, and Government plans a
further increase by 60 percent in 1982.  Even after these increases,
electric power in Zimbabwe will still be among the cheapest in the world,
mainly because the energy requirements will be supplied from cheap hydro
and coal generation with neither fuel nor diesel oil being used in the
system as in most other countries. Tariff levels in the past have been
fixed at the levels required to cover operating costs and debt service and
generate contributions to construction and to city revenues for the munici-
pal electricity departments. In future, sector average tariff levels will
be fixed at the levels required to cover annually operating costs, debt
service, working capital and make reasonable contributions to future
development costs.
Future Position
45.       Forecasts of consolidated power operations during FY82-91 show
that the sector's financial position will continue to be satisfactory.
Energy sales are projected to rise at about six percent yearly on average,
while revenue would increase by 25 percent and operating expenses by 18
percent average annually. The operating ratio would improve from 92
percent in FY82 to 58 percent in FY91.
Rates of Return, Liquidity and Debt
46.       Rates of return on revalued net fixed assets in operation over
the forecast period are estimated to vary around ten percent from FY85 af-
ter charging depreciation on a revalued basis. In order to be able to cal-
culate realistic annual rates of return, the Government agreed to revalue
annually the net fixed assets in operation of all the sector utilities in-
cluding CAPC's Zimbabwe assets from 1972, the year before the oil crisis
began (draft Guarantee Agreement, Section 4.09). The liquid position is
expected to remain satisfactory with a current ratio averaging about 2:0.
Borrowings required to meet the investment program, for the sector as a
whole, would increase the debt/equity ratio from 34:64 in FY81, to an ac-
ceptable maximum of 51:49 in FY90. However, to guard against excessive
borrowing, Government agreed during negotiations that it would obtain Bank
concurrence for any loan to the power sector which would increase the debt/
equity ratio above 60:40 (draft Guarantee Agreement, Section 4.07 (b)) and
for any loan of less than five years maturity which would raise the sec-
tor's short-term debt above ten percent of total debt (draft Guarantee
Agreement, Section 4.07(a)).

Previous Bank Participation
47.       The Bank made loans to CAPC in 1956 of US$80.0 million equivalent
(Loan 145-RN and in 1964 of US$7.7 million (Loan 392-RN), for the Kariba
Hydro-electricty project and extensions to the CAPC transmission system in
Zambia, respectively. The Bank also made a loan in 1970 to KNBC in an
amount of US$40 million equivalent (Loan 701-ZA) and a supplemental loan in
1974 (Loan 701-2-ZA) to assist in the construction of the Kariba North Bank
power station.  The projects for which the CAPC loans were made were
implemented smoothly and were completed before completion reports were
standard Bank procedure.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project Background
48.       The proposed project originated from a 1981 consultants' report
which determined at the Bank's suggestion, a least-cost development program
for the next 20 years. The proposed project is the first phase of that
program. A report entitled "Zimbabwe Power Project" (No. 3884-ZIM dated
November 16, 1982) is being distributed separately to the Executive
Directors. Negotiations were held in Washington from August 2-5, 1982.
The Zimbabwean delegation was led by Mr. Bryan Walters, Secretary to the
Treasury. Annex III contains supplementary project data.
49.       The development program is based on a projected average growth
rate in Zimbabwe of about 6.6 percent per annum for the next 18 years. A
load forecast for Zambia was also prepared to determine the likely availa-
bility of power for Zimbabwe to import from that country. The forecasts
indicated an 71 MW power shortage in Zimbabwe in mid-1985 which would be
met from system reserves and a shortage of 222 MW in mid-1986 which the
proposed project would meet. These forecasts were accepted by the Bank.
50.       Available primary energy resources -- Zambezi hydro potential,
coal resources and import possibilities from Zaire and Mozambique -- were
studied also to determine their economic priority and earliest available
commissioning dates. Gas turbine, diesel and nuclear power plant, solar
and wind energy options, were briefly studied and found uneconomic. The
proposed Hwange II project was determined as the next step in implementing
the least-cost development program, as it is the only project which can be
ready in time to meet the anticipated power shortages in mid-1986.
51.       Development Program.  Assuming agreement with Zambia on the de-
velopment of the Zambezi hydroelectric potential, consultants recommended a
least-cost power development program which would include (i) Hwange I (480
MW), to be commissioned in FY83; (ii) Hwange II (440 MW), to be commission-
ed in FY86; (iii) two hydro plants (600 MW), to be commissioned in FY87 and
FY88; (iv) Hwange III (400 MW), to be commissioned in FY89; (v) four hydro



- 13 -
plants (2800 MW), to be commissioned by FY98; and (vi) another thermal
plant (600 MW), to be commissioned in 2000. However, the Bank has suggest-
ed and the Government has agreed to review the proposed hydro/thermal mix
and the capacities of the proposed hydro plants' to be commissioned in
FY87/88 in order to optimize the hydro potential and each investment.
52.       The Hwange I, II and III plants will be fueled by up to two mil-
lion tonnes of steam coal that is currently stripped in the open cast mine
at Hwange, in order to extract higher quality coal that lies below. The
steam coal is dumped as waste and currently lost because of spontaneous
r            combustion.
Project Objectives
53.       The proposed project would (i) increase generation capacity to
meet the power demand through 1986 by helping to finance an extension to
the Hwange Thermal Power Plant; (ii) address, through technical assistance
and training, the short- and long-term manpower requirements of the sector;
(iii) improve resource mobilization and the economic use of energy by
adjusting and rationalizing of energy prices based on a pricing study; and
(iv) improve the organization in the power sector by strengthening the cen-
tral planning unit already established within MIED.
Project Description
54.       The proposed project will consist of:
(a)  construction of two generating units of 220 MW each
as an extension to the Hwange Thermal Power Station
(adjacent to the Hwange coal mine), comprising
boilers, turbo-generators, high pressure pipe work,
civil works and other mechanical and electrical
plant;
(b) construction of about 350 km of 330-kV power trans-
mission line and associated switchgear, to rein-
force the connection of the power station to the
Zimbabwe grid;
(c) provision of engineering consultants' services for
the preparation of bid documents, evaluation of
bids and construction supervision;
(d) electricity tariff structure and energy price
studies; and
(e) training and technical assistance to help meet the
sector's manpower needs.



- 14 -
55.       The training component, estimated to cost US$14.5 million, in-
cludes: (i) construction of a national training center plus equipment,
specialist services to assist in its establishment and scholarships for 15
technician-instructors; (ii) foreign training for project personnel; and
six training officers (three from ESC, one each from CAPC, HMED and BMED);
(iii) a minimum of 25 expatriate engineers needed immediately to operate
the Hwange I power plant. In this context, the Government will prepare and
submit a plan acceptable to the Bank for meeting the power sector's
manpower needs (para. 72).
56.       Proven coal reserves at Hwange are ample for the 35-year life of                  t
Hwange I and II plants. The Hwange Colliery Company Limited (HCC) is ob-
taining new equipment partly financed by IFC, in order to furnish coal for
the Hwange I and II power stations. Water will be supplied from the
Zambezi through an existing pipeline.
Cost Estimates
57.       Total project cost, excluding taxes and duties and without inter-
est during construction, is estimated at US$374.2 million (Z$258.0 million)
of which about 62 percent or US$233.4 million (Z$160.9 million) is foreign
expenditure. Although ESC is liable for customs duties on imported
materials and equipment, this project has been exempted from such duties.
The total financing required, including interest during construction and
the US$1.6 million front-end fee for the Bank loan, is estimated at
US$458.4 million (Z$316.1 million).
58.       The estimated cost of boilers, turbo-generators and high pressure
pipework (52 percent of foreign base expenditures) are from contracts al-
ready awarded by ESC. Estimates for other items are based on manufac-
turers' and contractors' offers for recent similar civil, mechanical and
electrical works in Europe and South Africa. Base costs of the project are
in September 1982 prices to which seven percent for physical contingencies
have been added. Price escalation for foreign expenditure is included at
8.5 percent in FY82; 7.5 percent in FY83-85 and 6.0 percent in FY86; for
local expenditure it is 15.0 percent in FY82, 12.0 percent in FY83,
11.0 percent, 10.0 percent and 9.0 percent for FY84, FY85 and FY86,
respectively. The risk of incurring cost overruns has been minimized by
obtaining bids for most of the remaining contracts prior to Board
presentation.
Financing Plan
59.       Suppliers' credits of about US$160 million have been arranged
with British and Italian firms to finance about 85 percent of the cost for
turbo-generators, boilers, high pressure pipework and portions of the mech-
anical and electrical plant. The remaining 15 percent will be financed
from Euro-dollar borrowing which will also finance interest during con-
struction on the loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB).  The propos-
ed Bank loan of US$105 million and the EIB loan of US$19 million will



- 15 -
jointly finance the transmission component and the balance of the electri-
cal and mechanical plant in the proportion 74:26 of the foreign costs --
the proportions to be finally agreed when contracts have been awarded as
EIB wishes to give preference to EEC countries. EIB will also finance
local costs up to 30 percent of its total loan. The Bank loan will also
finance civil works, consultants' services, training, technical assistance,
interest during construction on the Bank loan and the front-end fee. It
would finance 35 percent of the total foreign expenditure and 23 percent of
the total financing required. The Commonwealth Development Corporation
loan of Z$13 million (US$19 million) will finance 12 percent of the local
V         costs and interest during construction on the loan.
60.       IDC on the foreign and local borrowings for the total program
through FY86 would amount to US$130 million. Because of the time lag in
building up related revenues, tariff increases cannot cover IDC, and given
the very large investment program, the Government has requested lenders to
add IDC to their loans. Given the Power Sector's cash flow position, IDC
financing is justified.
Implementing Agency
61.       ESC, which is currently constructing the Hwange I power station,
will be responsible for implementing the project, and for that purpose, ESC
will appoint a project coordinator with qualifications, experience and
terms and conditions of employment satisfactory to the Bank (draft Loan
Agreement, Section 3.03). The engineering consultants, Merz and McLellan
(United Kingdom), have been assisting in preparing the bid documents and
will help in evaluating bids and supervising construction. The consult-
ants, who are also being employed for the Hwange I Project, prepared all
the feasibility studies for ESC and more recently the long-term power
development plan for the Government. The estimated cost of their services
in 1982 prices is US$17.4 million (about US$7,000 per man month of salary,
international travel and subsistence). Other consultants to study the
electricity tariff structure and energy pricing are estimated to cost
US$1.8 million.
62.       Most of the detailed engineering design has been completed and
contracts for some items, based on tenders received before the Bank's in-
volvement, are being financed from suppliers' credits. Bid documents for
other contract packages were modified to meet with Bank procurement guide-
lines. Construction is expected to begin before the end of 1982 and to be
completed by July 1986. In addition to consultants, ESC will appoint a
T1        project manager with qualifications and experience satisfactory to the Bank
(draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.03). In order to overcome the manpower
shortage, the project provides for training and technical assistance
(para. 55). In this context, the Government and ESC will prepare and sub-
mit to the Bank a comprehensive plan acceptable to the Bank, for meeting
the manpower needs of the power sector as a whole prior to effectiveness of



- 16 -
the Loan and Guarantee Agreements (draft Guarantee Agreement, Section
4.10).
Procurement and Disbursement
63.       Contracts for equipment and the construction of major buildings,
to be financed from the proposed Bank loan, would be grouped in appropriate
packages for international competitive bidding in conformity with Bank
guidelines.  Contracts to be financed by other colenders will be awarded on
the basis of their individual procurement procedures. Local procurement
will be accomplished by the ESC whose procurement procedures are acceptable
to the Bank.  Contracts to be financed from the proposed Bank loan, and
estimated to cost over US$0.5 million equivalent would be subject to prior
approval of the bid documents (draft Loan Agreement, Schedule 4C1(a)).
64.       Disbursements over five years, would be made (i) for 20 percent
of the total cost of civil works; (ii) 100 percent of the foreign cost of
equipment, engineering, consultants' services, training, technical assist-
ance and studies; and (iii) 100 percent of the front end fee and of the in-
terest during construction on the Bank loan. The closing date would be
June 30, 1987, about one year after the expected project completion date.
Monitoring and Evaluation
65.       ESC would, each fiscal year, have its accounts audited by an in-
dependent auditor acceptable to the Bank, and would submit to the Bank the
audited accounts within six months after the end of each fiscal year. In
addition, ESC would submit a Completion Report within one year after the
closing date (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.08(e)).
Environment
66.       The project will be located in an area (northwest of Zimbabwe)
which is devoid of agricultural activity, and vegetation is mostly scrub.
All economic activities are based on the coal mine. It is planned to re-
move fly ash from the flue gases in order to control air pollution.
Sulphur dioxide and the oxides of nitrogen wil be dispersed to the
atmosphere through a high chimney. Coal dust will be controlled by
appropriate equipment and strict operating procedures. Hwange township,
the nearest major population center, is sufficiently distant (6 km) for the
noise effects to be insignificant, and the project is not expected to
unduly expand the population density of the area.
Justification, Benefits and Risk
67.       Justification.  According to the projected load growth (6.6 per-
cent annual average growth rate), Zimbabwe will have power generation capa-
city shortfall by mid-1985. The shortfall will result from expected load
growth in Zimbabwe, retirement of the old thermal plant and reduction of
power available for export from Zambia due to expected domestic load



- 17 -
growth in that country. The winter peak of 1985 (July 1985) will be met
from system reserves. The shortfall is estimated at 222 MW or 12.6 percent
of the maximum demand by mid-1986. The Government is concerned about and
determined to avert the serious adverse effects the shortfall would have on
the economy as a whole, and on the industrial and mining sectors in parti-
cular. Following a comprehensive analysis of all available options (para.
47), it was determined that Hwange II is the appropriate project which
should be implemented in order to meet the required generation growth.  The
first unit will be commissioned in December 1985 and the second in March
1986.
68.       Rate of Return.  The internal rate of return (IRR) has been cal-
culated using capital expenditures over the first ten-year slice of the
least-cost development program and the incremental operating costs over 35
years, using FY81 as the base year. It is the discount rate at which the
cost stream, calculated on the basis of economic prices, is equal to the
benefit stream comprising the incremental revenue calculated from the
tariffs levels. Using the tariff level forecast for FY87 (the year Hwange
II will be in full operation), the IRR is 12.2 percent. Using the existing
tariff level, the IRR is estimated at 6.8 percent, indicating that the
tariff levels are too low. The sensitivity analysis using coal prices of
US$8.7 and US$14.0 per tonne, shows that IRR would be 6.1 percent and
5.5 percent, respectively, with existing tariff levels; 11.5 percent and
11.1 percent, respectively with the FY87 tariff level.
69.       Benefits.  The project would help Zimbabwe meet its power demand
in 1986, which is vital to the country's three important sectors --
industry, mining and commercial agriculture. The proposed energy pricing
study will assist the Government in devising effective energy policies, and
making optimal use of the country's scarce energy resources. The study
would also improve resource mobilization in the power sector through insti-
tuting appropriate tariff levels. Lastly, the training and technical as-
sistance component would assist in meeting the critical short- and long-
term manpower needs, and thereby help the power sector to continue operat-
ing efficiently.
70.       Risks.  Lack of skilled manpower could delay project implementa-
tion. However, the training and technical assistance to be provided under
the project, plus the requirement that ESC should continue to employ engin-
eering consultants whose qualifications and experience would be acceptable
to the Bank, would considerably reduce this risk. Secondly, although four
reservoirs of 68,000 cu m each will be constructed at the power station,
interruptions could occur in the make-up water for cooling by the 47 km
long pipeline. However, these interruptions, if any, would be very rare.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
71.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Electricity Supply Commis-
sion and the Bank, the Guarantee Loan Agreement between the Republic of



- 18 -
Zimbabwe and the Bank, and the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
72.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III. Effectiveness of the EEC and EIB loan agreements, and submis-
sion by the Guarantor of a plan acceptable to the Bank for meeting the
power sector's manpower needs, would be conditions of effectiveness of the
Loan and Guarantee Agreements (Guarantee Agreement, Section 7.01).
73.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
74.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. STATUS OF BANK AND IDA PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
(As of September 30, 1982)
Loan No. 1959-ZIM    Manufacturing Rehabilitation Imports Program:  US$50
Credit No. 1120-ZIM million and US$15 million, respectively, of April 9,
1981; Effectiveness Date: April 9, 1981; Closing
Date: March 31, 1982
The loan and credit have financed priority import requirements of
raw materials, spare parts, components and balancing equipment needed to
utilize idle capacity in the manufacturing sector. The program is being
implemented by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. The loan and credit are
already fully disbursed. It is too early to assess the full impact of the
loan and credit, nevertheless, during the loan and credit period,
manufactured output increased by almost 10 percent. However, because of a
shortfall in the availability of foreign exchange, full reconstruction of
the sector is unlikely to be achieved.
Loan No. 1994-ZIM    Transport Rehabilitation Imports Program:  US$42 mil-
lion, of June 22, 1981; Effectiveness Date: June 26,
1981; Closing Date: December 31, 1983
The Transport Rehabilitation Imports Program Loan is providing
for locomotive and wagon spare parts, electrical spare parts, general spare
parts, machines and tools, signalling equipment, service vehicles, track
tools and equipment, and technical assistance for the National Railways of
Zimbabwe and the Central Mechanical Equipment Department. The departure
rate of skilled staff has increased far beyond the level expected at loan
appraisal, resulting in additional need for technical assistance. Conse-
quently, in addition to the US$6.8 million for technical assistance estim-
ated at loan appraisal, another US$7.1 million has been reallocated to that
category. Since NRZ anticipates a considerable long-term technical assist-
ance requirement from 1984 onward, a special railway technical assistance
and training project, for which Bank assistance has been requested, is
under preparation.

D. STATUS OF IFC PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
(As of September 30, 1982)
Hwange Colliery Company Limited (HCCL)            552-ZIM
IFC's first investment in Zimbabwe, a loan of US$38 million
(gross) together with US$10 million arranged by IFC to cover the medium-
term maturities on an EximBank package, helped finance a US$191 million ex-
pansion of HCCL's coal mining operations, principally to supply a thermal
power plant. The financial plan included US$51 million of cash generation
and US$14 million to be raised by a rights offering. In view of the diffi-
culty a rights offering would face in the current stock market environment
in Zimbabwe, the Government has agreed to make an equity investment in the
Company to replace the rights issue. Under the terms negotiated, the Gov-
ernment will subscribe to 40 percent of the Company's equity and will nomi-
nate five out of the ten directors, including the chairman.
