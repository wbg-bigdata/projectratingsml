APPRAISAL OF THE
IAHORE WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
N4EST PAKISTAN
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan has requested
an IDA Credit to assist in iinancing an urgently required program of works
to rehabilitate and expand the water supply, sewerage and drainage facili-
ties for the City of Lahore.
ii.       The proposed Credit would be passed on to the Lahore Improvement
Trust (LIT), a semi-autonomous agency, through the West Pakistan Government.
iii.      The LIT is responsible for operating the existing facilities which
were handed over by the Lahore M4unicipal Council (LMC) in February 1967.
iv.       The water supply for Lahore is obtained from ground water sources
beneath the city, and provides a supply to about 850,000 consumers, or 60%
of the population. The rapid growth of the city has outpaced the present
capacity of the piecemeal system and water service is generally available
only 13 to 15 hours per day. Major works are urgently required to rehabi-
litate and integrate the present facilities, improve operation and mainte-
nance and extend the supply.
v.        The combined sewerage and drainage systems of Lahore are unable
to cope with the present loading, do not function as designed and a serious
unsanitary situation has been created within the city.
vi.       The present population of Lahore is 1.5 million and, assuming a
growth rate of 4% per annum, it would increase to 2.8 million by 1981. It
is anticipated that the demand for water would almost double by 1971 and
major improvement and expansion of the water supply, sewerage and drainage
systems would be required.
vii.      Engineering consultants prepared a report in 1964 on the long-
term program of works to meet the water, sewerage and drainage requirements
of the city until 1981, and the data has been augmented by the Public
Health Engineering Department, West Pakistan. The Government of Pakistan
has given the development program a high priority in its Third Five-Year
Plan 1965-1970.
viii.     The priority of the project is well established but there are
problems of administration and finance.



-ii -
ix.       A review of the financial operations of the facilities over the
past five years shows that the LMC accumulated heavy financial deficits.
This situation arose as a result of inefficient operations, charging
inadequate rates, poor billings, and collections and because a large
proportion of the water produced was supplied free of charge. A new rate
schedule, satisfactory to IDA, was adopted in February 1967.
x.        The development works until 1972 were defined by the mission in
consultation with the authorities, and construction costs reviewed.
Although this developrment program had been reduced to urgent and essential
works, the mission could not be certain that LIT, which took over from LMC
only in February 1967, would be able to solve the major organizational and
administrative problems it had inherited and efficiently carry out the
construction program. It was therefore agreed with the authorities that
management and engineering consultants would be obtained to assist the
borrower to improve operations ard that the project for IDA financing
would be limited to those items of construction works to be undertaken
in the first two years of the 1968-72 development program.
xi.       If the proposed project proceeds satisfactorily, consideration
may then be given to providing further assistance for the program. should,
however, serious problems or delays in execution be encountered, IDA would
avoid the commitment of funds during a long preparatory period, and the
risks of overruns in cost estimates arising from delays in construction
would be reduced.
xii.      The proposed IDA Credit of US$1.75 million  (PRs8.3 million)
would cover approximately 30 percent of the estimated project cost of
PRs27.5 million (US$5.8 million). The Kingdom of Sweden wishes to
participate in the financing of this project with a development credit
equivalent to US$1.75 million (PRs8.3 million) on terms and conditions
similar to the proposed IDA Credit. The Credits would cover those items
of supply and equipment for the construction program procured on an
international basis as well as foreign exchange costs of engineering and
management services and some local rupee costs amounting to about
US$0.9 million equivalent.
xiii.     With the agreements outlined in paragraph 7.04, the project forms
a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of US$1.75 million, the proceeds of
which would be relent by the Government of Pakistan through the Provincial
Government of W4est Pakistan to the LIT for a period of 25 years including
a 5-1/2 year grace period.



APPRAISAL OF THE
LAHORE WATER SUPPLY, SDTERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
1. INTRODTUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan has requested
a development credit from the International Development Association (IDA)
to assist in financing an urgently required program of works to rehabilitate
and expand the water supply, sewerage and drainage facilities for the City
of Lahore, West Pakistan. The program identified for the period through
1972 appears technically sound and would be financially viable if completed
as scheduled. But as there is doubt that LIT, which became responsible for
the facilities in February 1967, could effectively carry out the ambitious
construction program and simultaneously solve the administrative problems,
IDA recommended that consideration for a credit be confined to a limited
project. The project would include the building of an effective organi-
zation and those works contained in the first two years of the 1968-1972
program. If the project is completed satisfactorily, it should then be
possible to consider further financing of the program.
1.02      The proposed project would provide for the establishment of an
institution capable of efficiently operating the existing facilities and
effectively carrying out the program. The main items of technical works
would include detailed engineering for the development program, a start
on the rehabilitation of the existing facilities and some extensions to
the system.
1.03      This appraisal report is based on reports prepared by the Public
Health Engineering Department (PHED) and its engineering Consultants,
Hydrotechnic Corporation & Mabub Associates, and on the findings of IDA
missions to Lahore in February and September 1966 by Messrs. Robertson
and Apcar.

2. THE PROPOSED BORROWER
2.01      The borrower would be the Government of the Islamic Republic of
Pakistan, which would make the proceeds of the IDA Credit available to the
Lahore Improvement Trust (LIT), a semi-autonomous government body, through
the Provincial Government of West Pakistan.
2.02      The Government of West Pakistan promulgated an Ordinance in
February 1967, declaring inter alia that LIT would be the responsible
authority for providing water, sewerage and drainage services to the
Lahore Municipal area and environs.  Until 1967 the Lahore Municipal
Council (LMC) was responsible for the operation and development of the
sanitary facilities to the city but, because of the poor operational
performance of LYE, Government decided that the responsibilities might
be carried out more competently by LIT.
2.03      LIT a semi-autonomous body  created in 1936, is managed by a board
of eight trustees; five members appointed by the Provincial Government,
namely the Chairman of the Board, the Chairman of LMC and three senior
civil servants; the remaining three members are elected from councilors
of LIC. Its objectives are to undertake development and improvement projects
within the Greater Lahore area, and it obtains its funds from Government.
Its main activities include the acquisition of land, the development of
housing sites, including the provision of roads, water supply, sewerage
and drainage facilities and the selling of the developed properties to the
public. Annexes 1 and 2 show the organization of LIT.
2.04      LIT has a record of accomplishment but  it would require outside
assistance and time to build an effective operating organization to operate
a municipal utility and to properly carry out its responsibilities in
administering a construction program in water supply, sewerage and drainage.



3. THE PRESENT SITUATION
A. City of Lahore
3.01      Lahore is the second largest city in West Pakistan and the
provincial seat of the West Pakistan Government. It is a major commercial
and cultural center and contains large railway installations. The city
is located on the River Ravi at an elevation of 650 feet above sea level on
the Punjab Plain in the northeast of the country some 17 miles from the
Indian border.
3.02      The prescribed municipal area is 115.31  square miles.  The
present built up area, comprising approximately 40 square miles, contains
the old congested town situated on a hill some 40 feet above the main city
(See Map 1).
3.03      The present population of Lahore is approximately 1.5 million and
census figures available since 1930 indicate that its population has grown
at an annual rate in excess of 4 percent as against the national average of
2.5 percent. The rapid growth of Lahore is due primarily to the concentration
within its area of administration, government and attendant marketing
activities.
B. Existing Water §stem
3.04      The City of Lahore is fortunate in that its water supplies are
obtained from ground water sources beneath the city, which form part of the
Indus Basin Complex. The first municipal works were built in 1875 at Badami
Bagh adjacent to the Old City and are still in operation. Some 68 well
sites are now being pumped and a number of unconnected distribution systems
exist which supply over 28 million gallons of water per day. Water is
generally supplied untreated to consumers; some chlorination is practised
but it is not properly controlled.
3.05      The Lahore 1,1unicipal Corporation (LMC) at the time of turnover of
facilities to LIT supplied about 850,000 consumers or approximately 60 percent
of the population of Lahore with water. A number of other agencies such
as central government railways and large private consumers also supply and
distribute water from independent tubewells within their restricted areas.
There are other enclaves, such as agricultural villages, which rely on
private wells and irrigation water and many private houses have their own
tubewells. It is estimated that within the city 200 well sites are in use.
Water is also sold by private street vendors.
3.06      Chemical analyses indicate that the average well water is of
permissible quality according to International Standards as proposed by the
'Wbrld Health Organization. Although hard, and with total solids in excess
of normal potable standards, these are not of any sanitary significance and
the quality of the water is acceptable by the local authorities (see Annex 3).



- 4 -
3.07      No reliable test results are available on the bacteriological
quality of the well water. As water is obtained from depths of 150 to
300 feet, there is little likelihood of bacteriological contamination if
the wells are properly built, but contamination almost certainly takes
place in the present distribution system. Chlorination would be essential
to safeguard the quality of the water.
3.08      Due to poor planning in the past the municipal facilities were
expanded piecemeal by providing independent wells and storage reservoirs
at the centers of major demand. The supply is intermittent, generally 13
to 15 hours per day, pressures are low and, because of poor maintenance
and control, it is estimated that at least 40% of the production is
unaccounted-for or wasted.
3.09      The municipal distribution systems handed over to LIT comprise
about 4 miles of cast iron mains 12 to 30 inches in diameter and over
230 miles of small pipes ranging from 3 to 12 inches in diameter. Storage
reservoirs, including the original 1 million gallon reservoir in the Old
City and a number of composite brick/concrete elevated tanks, provide a
total storage of approximately 2.5 million gallons which is quite inadequate
for present day requirements.
3.10      As large areas of the city do not possess a complete distribution
system, consumers are connected to mains through long lengths of small
diameter galvanized pipes. These pipes are generally in poor condition and
result in waste of water and losses in pressure thereby reducing further
the quality of service provided to the consumer. A large number of consumers,
particularly in the Old City, obtain their supplies from public standpipes.
3.11      Records indicate that there are about 55,000 municipal water
supply connections classified as follows:
(1)  Utnmetered domestic connections                 48,985
(2)  Metered domestic connections                     3,230
(3)  Metered commercial connections                     981
(4) Metered connections (large commercial
institutions and industries)                      99
(5) Concessional connections (Mosques and
other institutions)                              619
(6)  Public standpipes - unmetered                      994
Total              54,908
3.12      There are no facilities for repairing or testing meters and it
is likely that only a few of the 4,300 meters are functioning properly.



- 5 -
C. Existing Sewerage and Drainage Facilities
3.13      The combined sewerage and drainage system of the city is based
on a plan prepared in 1937, and consists of a number of interconnected
sewers and drainage channels which carry a combination of general drainage
water and sewage. The storm drain system performs a dual function of
conveying kitchen drainage to points where it can be discharged into sewers
as well as carrying away storm runoffs.
3.14      In the older sections of the city where few sewers exist, night
soil is collected and removed by conservancy crews or discharged into
open drains. Considerable use is also made of cesspools and septic tanks,
Better class residential areas are sewered and connected to disposal
plants.
3.15      A general network of underground sewers and pumping stations
exists but certain main sewers have never been completed and proper
pumping facilities have been omitted. (See Flap II). As the sewer system
is now grossly overloaded and in a dilapidated state, rehabilitation
and expansion works are urgently required.
3.16      Serious drainage problems occur in Lahore during the monsoon
season. Due to the flat topography of the area, the presence of the
River Ravi and flood protection works and an irrigation canal, it is
necessary to dispose of most of the storm water by pumping. (See Map III),
The existing system is inadequate and in a state of disrepair, channels
are silted up and overloaded, and the facilities require urgent rehabili-
tation, maintenance and major expansion.
D. Administration
3.17      The departmental structure of government in West Pakistan has
been subjected to considerable change during the past decade. The Ministry
of Basic Democracies and Local Government is the government agency now
responsible for the Lahore Municipal Council and the Lahore Improvement
Trust.
3.18      The function of the Lahore Improvement Trust has been to prepare
and execute programs of work for the improvement and development of the
City of Lahore and environs. Its area of responsibility of over 128 square
miles includes the areas of jurisdiction of LMC, the Cantonments Board and
the West Pakistan Railway depots in Lahore. LIT has effectively carried
out a number of schemes involving land acquisition, slum clearance,
housing, and general public works, including the provision of sanitary
facilities within the developed areas. See Annex 4 for Comparative
Operating Statements relating to the financial performance of LIT
fot the period 1961-1965.
3.19      LIT is aware of the deficiencies in the organization which it has
taken over from LIC. In order to meet its additional responsibilities, LIT
has, with the approval of IDA, recruited the services of Messrs. Booz, Allan
and Hamilton International, Mhnagement Consultants to advise and implement
proposals regarding the organization and administration.



-6-
E. Rates and Revenues
3.20      Water services are charged on the basis of water consumed as
measured by meter; by the size of cornection if there is no meter; or as
a percentage of the annual rental value of property. Present water rates
and service charges (see Annex 5), approved in February 1967 almost
doubled the previous charges for water. In addition, payment is now
required at the rate of PRsl.00 per 1,000 gallons for water consumed
through community standposts, and religious and charitable institutions
are charged at half the new domestic rate. These rates campare favorably
with the prices charged by vendors of about PRs7.20 per 1,000 gallons
equivalent.
3.21      No adequate organization existed within L4C for reading meters,
preparing and presenting consumer bills or for the collection of revenue
for water, sewerage and drainage services. No proper control was
exercised in recording outstanding accounts or initiating action on
disconnection of consumers for non-payments, and very unsatisfactory
financia'l results were obtained.
3.92      The net fixed assets of the Lahore Water Supply, Sewerage and
Drainage Systems, as agreed between IIC and LIT, have been valued at
PRsl9.1 million. Total revenues collected by LMC from the operation of
water and sewerage and drainage facilities in 1964-1965 amounted to
PRsl.96 million as compared to expenses of PRs4.14.  The following table
shows the water supply and sewerage revenues and operating expenditures
(excluding depreciation) of IviC over the past five years and indicates
the severity of the losses being incurred, and Annex 6 shows Comparative
Operating Statements of the water supply and sewerage operations for 1961
through 1965:

was unable to provide a statement showing revenues collected through
property taxes on account of sewerage and drainage services.

h.  FUTURE REQUIREIENTS
4.01      In 1961 the City of Lahore had a population of 1.3 million:  from
1901 it increased at the average rate of 3.75% per annum with fluctuations
from 1.2% to 4.6%. From 1930 to date, the population has been growing at
an average annual rate in excess of 4% and for the purposes of this
appraisal, a rate of growth of 4% per annum has been taken as a realistic
index for the next 20 years. Projections, indicating that the population
would reach 1.9 million in 1971 and 2.8 million in 1981, are shown in
Annex 7.
4.02      Because of lack of data regarding the distribution and economic
status of the existing and potential customers, the preparation of realistic
proposals for the expansion of the water and sewerage utilities is difficult.
It is clear, however, that the central areas of Lahore cannot support
further population without radical redevelopment and such development is
not likely in the immediate future. Future requirements for water have
been estimated by relating the present estimated water use patterns to the
future anticipated distribution of population.
4.03      The present average supply in the municipal areas is about 35
gallons per capita per day. Requirements amount to 30 gallons per capita
per day in areas where population densities average 125 persons per acre.
It is not anticipated that any major increases in consumption would occur
through community standposts or for industrial or commercial uses. The
largest increases would occur through improved supply, providing additional
connections to existing houses and extending the supply to meet the needs
arising frao new housing projects.
4.08      Gross average demand might be expected to reach about 60 million
gallons per day, equivalent to 40 gallons per capita per day, by 1972.
The estimated population and water use pattern are shown in Annex 8.
Initially, provision would be made to supply 75% of the future population
by 1972, and 80% by 1976.

the present system, but site investigations suggest a peak varying from
145 to 1.65 times the average daily load; this is confirmed by the water
department's consumption data. In order to avoid the danger of over-design,
it would be reasonable to take a figure of 1.5 for the peak daily demand
and to assume peak hourly demands of 2.25 times the average hourly demand.
4.O6      The estimates of future requirements assume that the water use
pattern and income and housing standards in the City of Lahore would not
radically change from present levals. Annex 9 contains pertinent data
on income and housing distribution, while Annex 10 shows the anticipated
total production and water consumption through 1976.
4.07      The water supply, sewerage and drainage facilities of the City
of Lahore are inadequate and conditions are deteriorating. If future re-
quirements are to be adequately met, LIT must embark on a program to reha-
bilitate and expand the services and direct particular attention to dealing
with the need to increase revenue and reduce losses.
4.08      In the future, additional benefits other than those reflected
in the financial projections may be expected through an increase in the
industrial and commercial potential of the city and social and health
benefits, which cannot be quantified at this time, but which may be sub-
stantial. The withdrawal of larger quantities of water would also provide
benefits as the rising level of the ground water in areas adjacent to
Lahore may create problems in the future,

5. THE PROJECT
A. General
5.01      The project would consist of the water supply, sewerage and drainage
works to be undertaken within the first two fiscal years of the 1968-1972
rehabilitation and expansion program and the setting up of an effective
organization to manage the present and future works.
B. Consultant Services
5.02      During the project period LIT would employ the services of manage-
ment and engineering consultants.
5.03      The scope of work and draft contract between LIT and management
consultants have been approved by IDA. LIT with the advice of its manage-
ment consultants, Messrs. Booz Allen Hamilton International Inc. will set
up a separate department within its organization to deal with water supply,
sewerage and drainage responsibilities. This department will prepare
separate accounts in accordance with accepted standards. During the
project period staffing establishments will be drawn up and staff recruited,
proper billings and collections of revenue will be initiated and external
auditors appointed. LIT has considerable experience in the acquisition of
land and no serious problems are anticipated in acquiring the various sites
and rights of way required for the project.
5.04      The firm Nihon Suido (Japan), engineering consultants, has been
selected to review the design criteria and prepare the detailed designs,
specifications and contract documents for the water supply, sewerage and
drainage facilities required to meet the demand until 1972 and supervise
construction works required for the project.
C. Water Supply
5.05      The project would include:
(i)  investigations, exploratory site works and the design of suitable
wells to obtain good quality water; one well center would be
constructed, comprising six tubewells and ancillary mechanical
and electrical equipment and controls, to provide some additional
water to meet immediate demands. Records indicate that adequate
quantities of ground water are available to meet future requirements;
(ii) preparation of a program to rehabilitate the existing systems and
to reduce the amount of unaccounted-for water; immediate works
would include the inspection and repair of the system, scraping
mains, replacing dilapidated sections and renewing connections;



- 10 -
(iii) preparation of a waste detection program; installation of
waste meters at salient points in the system together wTith
inspection and repair of approximately 5,000 existing
connections;
(iv) a metering program to install about 19,000 meters, of wrhich
about 4,000 would be completed during the project period.
Priority would be given to the proper metering of community
standposts and facilities would be provided for the repair
and testing of meters;
(v) distribution works comprising approximately two miles of
new mains, 24 inches in diameter, and some four miles of
smaller mains, 4 inches to 12 inches in diameter to strengthen
the existing system, provide some improvement in supply and
meet the water needs of newly developed areas.
D. Sewerage and Drainage
5.o6      The project would include some rehabilitation of the sewerage
and drainage systems, separating these facilities and completing sewers and
drains where gaps exist.  About five miles of sewers and drains and three
miles of unpaved drainage channels would be laid together with three sewerage
collection centers and two main drainage pumping stations.
5.07      The 1972 program aims to remove all sewage from the city.  As an
interim arrangement the untreated sewage would be used either for irrigation
purposes or discharged into the river; treatment facilities would not be
provided during the project period.  The project will improve the present
position considerably and will centralize thXe collection of musanitary wTater
and storm drainage and ensure their removal from the city. Provision will
be made later in the development program to provide more adequate treatment
and disposal.
E. Cost Estimates
5.o8      Projections indicate that the project would form part of a techni-
cally sound and financially viable program of works.  Construction cost
estimates for the various elements of the development program through 1972
are shown in Annex 12.
5.09      The total estimated cost of the proposed two-year project of
PRs 27.5 million is made up as follows:
In Millions of Rupees
Local      Foreign       Total
Water Supply WIorks                       4.7          5.1          9.8
Scwerage Works                            4.0          2.5          6.5

Interest During Construction              0.7           -           0.7
15.1        12.4         27.5



-11-
It is anticipated that the bulk of the funds would be disbursed during the
two-year period commencing July 1, 1967 but some amounts may be carried over
into the third year to meet payments such as retention sums on contracts.
5.10      The proposed IDA credit of US$1.75 million equivalent is about
30 percent of the total cost of the project. The Kingdom of Sweden will
also participate in the financing of this project and proposes to make
available a sum equal to the IDA contribution. These credits totalling
USO3.5 million equivalent would meet the foreign exchange costs, estimated
to be US$2.6 equivalent for consultant services, construction contracts
and costs incurred in importing machinery, pipes, meters and electrical
equipment. The balance of US$0.9 million equivalent would be disbursed
against local expenditures arising from consultant services and construction
contracts submitted to international competitive bidding. For this last
item, IDA and the Kingdom of Sweden would each disburse 25 percent of the local
costs. It is the intention to disburse the full amount of the credits on
the project; if savings in imported goods and services are realized, a
proportionally larger anmount of the local costs will be financed.
5.11      Unit costs have been provided by the Public Health Engineering
Department (PHED), West Pakistan, and checked against local contract
documents. No bids have been invited for any items of the works. The
cost of engineering services has been assumed for a two-year contract
period and reflect recent prices for such services. The cost of management
consultant services for the project has been taken from the actual contract.
5.12      Construction cost estimates include a contingency factor of 10
percent, escalation of 3 percent per annum on local costs and an allowance
for import duti es and sales taxes based on a schedule of tariffs varying
from 30 percent for machinery to 12½ percent for cast iron items on CIF
prices.
5.13      Cost estimates are considered reasonable on the assumption that
present trends in prices and labor stability would continue, and that the
works would be carried out as phased.
F. Procurement
5.14      Major construction contracts and all contracts for major items
of equipment and materials to be financed from IDA and Swedish funds would
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. Tenders
would be invited toward the end of 1967 after the engineering consultants
have had the opportunity to review and approve the design requirements.
5.15      As the project is not large, it may be possible to group the
civil works into two or three units of sufficient magnitude to attract
the interest of foreign firms. The local contracting industry is familiar
with the accepted contractual practices, and should be able to compete
for most of the civil works contracts.

6. FINANCING PLAN
A.  Requirements and Sources of Funds
6.01      The plan for financing the project, as shown below, is based on
the estimated construction cost including interest during construction and
initial working capital requirements:
Fiscal Years Ending June 30                       1968 and 1969
Rupees          Equivalent
('000,000)
Requirements for Funds
Project Construction Costs                    21.1              4.
Engineering and M4anagement Services           5.7              1.2
Interest During Construction                   0.7              0.2
Working Capital                                0.9               0.2
Total Requirements                  28.4              6.o
Sources of Funds
Proposed IDA Credit                            8.3              1.75
Swedish Loan                                   8.3              1.75
Government Loan                               11.8              2.50
Total Sources                       28.4              6.00
6.02      It has been assumed for the purpose of the projections that an IDA
Credit of US$1.75 million and a Swedish loan of a sum equivalent to
US$1.75 million would be passed on to the Provincial Government for relend-
ing to LIT for a period of 25 years, including a grace period of 5-1/2 years,
with an interest rate of 3-1/2 percent per annum, which is the current
government lending rate for water projects. The balance of the funds
required for the project (PRsll.8 million) would be made available by the
Government of Pakistan on the same conditions as for the IDA Credit.
6.03      Although it is possible some cash surplus could be generated from
operations during the project construction period,it has been assumed that
the proposed project would be financed entirely from borrowed funds.
Reasonable contingencies have been allowed in preparing the financial
projections of the new and untried organization and it is considered
prudent that the surplus cash should be retained as a contingency reserve.
Depending upon its financial performance during the course of the proposed
project, the extent to which LIT could finance future development from
funds generated from operations would be determined.



- 13 -
B. Water and Sewerage Rates
6.o4     In order to raise the gross revenues indicated in the Income
Statements (Annex 13) a new tariff of charges, acceptable to IDA, has been
put into effect as from February 1967 (Annex 5). During the project period,
these new rates, which should be within the capacity of consumers to pay,
should yield an average gross revenue of PRs 1.23 per 1,000 gallons of
water consumed exclusive of sewer and drainage revenues. The combined
gross revenue from all three services during the same period should average
PRs 1.56 per 1,000 gallons of water consumed.
6.o5     It is imperative for the success of the project that LIT should
receive full payment for all wTater supplied through community standposts
and it has been agreed that all such water is to be charged on the basis
of quantity consumed. Government has guaranteed that conmencing May 31, 1967,
LHC would pay to LIT PRs 200 per month per unmetered community standpost.
Arrangements are being made for the collection of sewer and drainage taxes
by L11C and for their transfer to LIT.
6.o6     Should the proposed project be executed as scheduled, the revenue
from the new water rates and sewer and drainage charges would enable LIT
to cover its operating expenses, including depreciation, and contribute
towrards the financing of future development. If as planned the performance
of management is improved no increase in rates for services would be neces-
sary at the end of the project.
C   Financial Projections
6.07     The Estimated Income Statements, Sources and Application of Funds,
and Pro Forma Balance Sheets for the program are show^M in Annexes 13, 1l
and 15 respectively. Assumptions for these forecasts are given in Annex 16.
These projections have been prepared assuming that the project covered by
the proposed credit would form the first two years of a continuous develop-
ment program up to 1972.
6.08     During the period 1965-1972 it is estimated that the volume of water
supplied would increase 1.8 times, while operating expenditures and gross
revenues would increase 2.7 and 11.6 times respectively. These rates of
increase differ as the projections reflect more accurately than present
figures the costs incurred in producing the services, and show the increase
in revenue from increased rates, improved performance in coLlections, and
payment for water consumed through community standposts.
6.og     As compared to a net deficit of PRs 2.6 million in 1965 (See
Annex 6) it should be possible to achieve net operating revenues of PRs 1.6
million in 1968 and PRs 5.2 million in 1972.
6.10     On the assumption that effective management would be provided,
maintenance efficiently carried out, and the program of works executed on
schedule, the following financial performance would be expected:



-14-
(a) The rate of return at the completion of the project would be
3.8 percent rising to 5.7 percent in 1973, increasing there-
after to 12.9 percent by 1977.
(b) The operating ratio, which includes reasonable maintenance
and depreciation allowances, would improve from 88 percent
in 1968 to 75 percent in 1973.
(c) The debt service coverage would improve from 1.4:1 in 1973
to 2.3:1 in 1977.
(d) The cash flow forecast shows a surplus of PRs6.0 million
at the end of the project. A part of this surplus and
future funds generated from future operations would be
applied against the expansion program comrencing July 1969.
It is presently forecast that PRs76.25 million would be
required for the program 1969-72 and it is anticipated that
LIT would provide PRsl9.0 million towards this program from
funds generated frcrn operations.
(e) The debt/equity ratio would rise from 29:71 in 1968 to
71:29 in June 1972 and fall gradually thereafter.

7.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMEOlDATIONS
7.01      The proposed project is part of a technically sound long-term
program of works to improve the presently inadequate water, sewerage and
drainage facilities of the City of Lahore and to meet future demands. It
would improve living conditions and stimulate economic development of the
urban area.
7.02      It is recommended that an IDA Credit be made to finance a project
to carry out the first two years of the 1968-1972 development program. By
adopting this procedure the possible tying up of IDA funds during a long
preparatory period and the risks of overruns in cost estimates would be
avoided should serious problems or delays in execution be encountered in
this phase. Should the project proceed satisfactorily further assistance
for the program could be considered. Cost estimates and construction
schedules are reasonable and, with adequate water rates and efficient
collections of revenue, the financial condition of the operating authority
would be satisfactory.
7.03      In order to carry out the program of works efficiently, LIT would
have to be strengthened at management, organizational and technical levels.
7.04      During negotiations of the proposed IDA Credit it was agreed that
the Government of Pakistan would undertake to:
(a) provide, promptly as needed, the funds, facilities, services
and other resources required to carry out the project;
(b) relend the proceeds of the Credit to the Provincial Government
of West Pakistan which would relend it to LIT on terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA.
Since negotiations:
I.   The Provincial Government of West Pakistan has carried out the
following:
(a) promulgated an ordinance transferring the water supply,
sewerage and drainage facilities of the City of Lahore
from LvIC to LIT;
(b) levied water, sewer and drainage rates, satisfactory to IDA;
(c) given approval to arrangements satisfactory to IDA, for
payments for water consumed through community standposts.



-16-
II.   The Lahore Improvement Trust has carried out the following to
the satisfaction of IDA:
(a) appointed a Project Director;
(b) engaged management consultants; and
(c) selected engineering consultants.
III.   The Lahore Improvement Trust has further agreed to carry out
the following:
(a) set up separate accounts for the water supply, sewerage
and drainage facilities;
(b) appoint independent auditors to audit the accounts; and
(c) undertake a program to meter water connections.
7.05      With the above agreements the project would provide a suitable
basis for an IDA Credit in an amount equivalent to US$1.75 million. The
Government of Pakistan, through the Provincial Government of West Pakistan,
would make available the equivalent of these funds to the Lahore Improvement
Trust for a period of 25 years, including a 5-1/2 year period of grace with
an interest rate of 3-1/2 percent per annum, for the rehabilitation and
expansion of the water supply, sewerage and drainage systems for the City
of Lahore. The Kingdom of Sweden wishes to participate in the financing
of this project and also proposes to make available a development credit
equivalent to US$1.75 million, on terms and conditions similar to the
proposed IDA Credit.

LAHORE WATER SUPPLY, SEtTERAGE AND DRAFJAGE PROJECT
ORGANIZATION OF LAHORE IMPROVEMT TRUST
1.        The Lahore Improvement Trust (LIT) was created in 1936 under the
Punjab Town Improvement Act of 1922. The Board consists of eight trustees,
five of whom are appointed by the Provincial Government of West Pakistan.
They include the Chairman, who is a Senior Government Servant, the Deputy
Cormissioner of Lahore, the Chairman of the Lahore Municipal Council (LMC),
and two others selected from local government and the Ministry of Finance.
The other three members of the Board are elected from councilors of LMC.
2.        The primary object of LIT is to provide for the improvement and
expansion of the City of Lahore and environments and its authority extends
over an area of 128 square miles. It is responsible for developing new
areas within the jurisdiction of LEO., Lahore Cantonments Board and the West
Pakistan Railway areas. A proposal to extend the limits of the area to 380
square miles is presently before the Provincial Government.
3.        LIT devotes its attention to the acquisition of land, the develop-
ment of housing sites together with the provision of roads, water supply,
sewerage and drainage facilities. LIT normally obtains its funds from
government and recovers the cost of development by selling the assets to
private individuals.  The sanitary facilities however were, until recently,
handed over free of encumbrances to LMC who were then responsible for their
maintenance.
4.        During the past 30 years, despite World War II and the aftermath
of Partition, LIT has successfully executed a number of schemes which eased
the difficult housing conditions in Lahore. Specifically, it has undertaken
slum clearance, road improvements, housing schemes, including water supply,
sewerage and drainage projects, rehabilitation of industries and the clear-
ance of large areas within the walled city which were badly damaged during
the period immediately following Partition. LIT employed a small engineer-
ing staff and, as required, used the services of LMC, the Public Health
Engineering Department (PHED), and consultants to assist in carrying out
its projects.
5.        Government has decided that LIT should be responsible for the
wiater supply, sewerage and drainage for the City of Lahore and an ordinance
promulgated in February 1967 transferred the staff and assets from LMC to
LIT. PHED has transferred a senior officer to take over the post of Project
Director and supporting staff will also be made available. The qualifications
and duties of the Project Director have been approved by IDA.

6.        The services of Messrs, Booz, Allen and Hamilton International,Inc.,
Management Consultants, have been retained by LIT to advise and assist in
setting up an effective organization to manage the affairs relating to
water supply, sewerage and drainage and carry out the expansion program.
The consultants will also advise and implement the various proposals, par-
ticularly the setting up of separate accounts, enforcing billings and
collections of revenue, and administrative procedures.
7.        The pre-selection of engineering consultant firms has been com-
pleted and it is proposed to recruit the services of Nihon Suido (Japan) to
undertake the engineering for the program of works to meet demands until
1972, with special emphasis on planning and implementing the works contained
in the first two years of the program.

Chlorides                  250-500 ppm                54 ppm
Sulphates                  250 ppm                    99 ppm
Iron                       0.3 ppm                    Absent
Nitrates                   Trace Objectionable        Absent
The average results of more complete analyses based on 8 samples
are as follows:
pH                          7.8
Total Solids               503 ppm
Total Hardness             182 ppm
Chlorides                    79 ppm
Sulphates                  116 ppm
Iron                       Absent
Nitrates                   Absent
Calcium Carbonate           41 ppm

Free Ammonia               0.127 ppm
Albuminoid Ammonia          0.127 ppm
These tests show that except for total hardness the water quality
meets the normal permissible limits. Several samples indicated a high de-
gree of turbidity while others recorded total solids of high values; these
factors are, however, of little sanitary importance.

Distribution of Housing by Income Groups
1.        The average number of persons per household in Lahore is estimated
at just under six; the average family contains 1.39 employed persons and
has income of 121 rupees per month. The more prosperous households tend
to have between six and eight persons whereas those in the lower income
groups contain between four and five persons. The distribution of incomes
and households, as estimated in a socio-economic survey carried out by the
Punjab University in 1964 is as follows:
Households/Income Groups
Income                   No. of
(Rs./Month)             Households                 Percentage

1,000 +                      3,700                     1.5
Total        245,810                   100.0
2.        The housing situation in Lahore is serious, as some 80% of the
household units were built prior to 1947 and current construction rates
of new units is not sufficient to cope with the demands created by popula-
tion growth. There are about a quarter of a million household units, of
which less than 35% enjoy water service and the situation regarding
sewerage and drainage is more serious.
3.        In order to deal with the housing problems the LIT is currently
engaged in providing 10,000 houses under approved programs and the Housing
and Settlement Agency is involved in constructing a further 20,000 units.
4.        It has been assumed that the LIT and other agencies would provide
houses at the rate of 11,000 units per annum by 1969.

LAHORE WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
Long-Term Development Program
1.        The authorities in Lahore have drawn up a comprehensive develop-
ment program of works to rehabilitate the present inadequate water, sewerage
and drainage facilities for the city and to meet the anticipated demand
until 1981. The development program has been divided into two periods
1968-72 and 1973-81; the works in the first period have been closely de-
fined and are discussed below, while the works in the second period have
been identified in magnitude only.
Water Supply
2.        The program calls for the further exploitation of ground water
sources beneath the city to meet the future water requirements. Three
alternative sources of water have been investigated; namely, the River
Ravi, canal sources and the River Chenab but al1 have been discarded on
the basis of the high costs involved. Investigations indicate that ade-
quate quantities of ground water would be available to meet demands for
the foreseeable future; the water may have a high mineral content but
would generally meet international permissible standards and be accept-
able to the authorities in Lahore.
3.        The program (1968-72) would provide for rehabilitation of the
existing system, the implementation of waste prevention and metering pro-
grams and the expansion of the supply to meet demands tof about 53 mgd by
1972 and provide reserve capacity for peak loads.
14.       Rehabilitation would include scraping and cleaning about 140
miles of mains, repairing and replacing sections where necessary, inspect-
ing existing tubewells and abandoning inefficient or poor quality wells
and inspecting some 20,000 connections.
5.        Five new well centers containing a total of 30 wells, of im-
proved design, would be provided together with some isolated wells at
salient points in the system to increase the production of water. Each
well center would normally contain six wells, a storage reservoir of
about half a million gallons capacity together with controls, recording,
and chlorination equipment, and a small field office.
6.        Approximately 30 miles of pipelines, 18-30 inches in diameter
would be laid to interconnect the multiple supply centers, imAprove control
of pumping operations and provide more efficient distribution facilities.
A fuwrther 25 mi'.s of srmall (d.stribution pipelines would also be laid to
provide better consunicr servi-,.e.
7.        It is propos&i to v,bovide a conuInurus supply of a-wter at a
pressure of between 20 to 25 is-,s. p.r scre inch on the coripletion of the
rehabilitation works increacing to 30 lbs. per square inch by 1972 while
supplying peak daily loads of 1.5 times the average daily demand.



ANNEX 11
Page 2
8.        The extensions to the water supply would be coordinated with the
approved housing program and it is anticipated that about 11,000 new con-
nections per year would be required (see 1Map 1). A metering program would
also be carried out and some 19,000 meters would be installed in the de-
velopment program period.
Sewerage
9.        The future sewer system would be divided into five coordinated
districts. The missing links of the existing system would be built and
the existing sewers cleaned. Two new collection centers located at Katcha
Multan and Satto Kotla would be provided in the southwestern section of
the area. The effluent from these works would be subjected to simple lagoon-
ing prior to pumping to selected irrigation areas.
10.       The existing dilapidated works at Shad Bagh in the northern
section of the city would be replaced with new works further from the city
and nearer the river while the Main Central Works would be rehabilitated
and primary treatment provided.
11.       The Nawankot Works which are only partially operating would be
rehabilitated and extended, while the Shad Bagh and Baghbanpura pumping
station would be abandoned. The Chotta Ravi and Rajagah Stations would
be rehabilitated and become intermediate stations.
12.       The project would provide for the construction of two new main
sewer systems. The first, the Katcha lAultan System provides for two
lateral sewers, one along the proposed Mian Mir diversion and the other
along MIultan Road, to relieve the south western congestion. The second,
the Satto Kotla system would relieve the southern section including the
cantonments and industrial areas east of the railway line and the new Model
Town area.
13.       The sewage would not be treated and would be utilized for irri-
gation in selected areas (see Map II). Full treatment would be provided
in the second period, 1973-81, of the development program.
Drainage
14.       The project would provide for the clearing and removal of obstruc-
tions in the existing drainage channels which would be enlarged and paved.
15.       The works attached to the Chotta Ravi drainage basin would include
pumping facilities, a canal of 8,000 feet from the southern section to the
Bund and an unlined canal from the Shalimar Escape.



ANNEX 11
Page 3
16.       The Nian Mir basin would be drained by two new canals.  The first
would drain about 5,000 acres of the northeastern section together with a
pumping station at Babu Sabu to discharge the waste into the River Ravi.
The second major outfall canal would drain an area of some 15,00Q acres
from the eastern section and discharge into the Ravi by gravity downstream
of the city. When the flocd water levels in the Ravi rise this canal
would probably start to back up so that low lying areas would be flooded.
The possible extent of flooding can only be determined after detailed
engineering studies have been completed. Associated with the main drain-
age canals would be the provision of drainage outlets for dealing with
the run-off from the low lying areas (see Map III).
17.       The total estimated cost of the 1968-72 program would be about
PRs 104.65 million. Preliminary estimates would indicate that after 1972
an annual expenditure of about PRs 25 million would be required to meet
the anticipated demand for services until 1981. Engineering consultants
will be retained to evaluate more accurately future requirements for
services and prepare construction cost estimates.

LAHORE WIATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
Assumptions for Financial Projections
1.        Operating Revenues accruing from sales of water, sewerage and
drainage charges are based on the rate schedule effective February 1967.
(see Annex 5).
2.        Provision against Bad Debts is made of 25% of gross operating
revenues for ±iscal years l9bb and 1969; 20% for 1970 and 1971; 15% for
1972 and 1973 and 10% thereafter.
3.        Escalation of 3% per annum has been allowed for operations,
maintenance and capital expenditures through 1977 to cover possible future
increases in local costs; this is presently considered reasonable for West
Pakistan.
4.       IMaintenance charges have been estimated at one percent of the
existing gross fixed assets at the beginning of each fiscal year, and one
half of one percent of assets added within the year.
5.        Wages & Salaries are estimated to increase 10% annually to take
account of expected increments in salaries and increases in staff members.
6.        Administration costs are estimated at 33% of the total shown
under liages and Salaries.
7.        Contingencies (excluding depreciation and write offs for bad debts)
represent lO, of operating expenses.
8.        Return on liet kAxed Aossets has been obtained by comparing net
operating revenues including interest in any year with the opening balance
of net fixed assets of that year and expressing them as a percentage thereof.
9.        Operating ratio is expressed as a percentage which total operating
expenses bear to operating revenues.
10.       Debt service coverage is calculated by dividing total cash gen-
erated from operations (including depreciation) by the sum of interest
charges and amortization payments.
11.      Accounts Receivable are assumed to amount to 25% of the total opera-
ting revenue less allowance for bad debts.
12.       Current liabilities are the payables estimated at 25% of operating
expenses, excluding depreciation, plus the amortization due on long-term
debt within the year.

13.       Power and Chemicals.  Charges have been taken at PRs96 per mgd,
equivalent to PRsO.13 per kilowatt hour and a chlorine injection rate of
1.5 parts per million.
14.       Depreciation on new fixed assets has been estimated at 2.5% as-
suming an average asset life of 40 years. Depreciation at 4.5% of the
opening balance of gross fixed assets assumes an average asset life of
22 years for the existing fixed assets.
15.       Equity.  The value of the net fixed assets of the Lahore Water
Supply, Sewerage & Drainage Systems has been agreed at PRsl9.1 million
by L4C and LIT.
16.       The proposed IDA Credit of US$1.75 million (PRs8.3 million
equivalent) would be made available to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan
for a term of 50 years, with service charges of three-quarters of 1 percent
per annum. The Government of Pakistan, through the Provincial Government,
would make the equivalent of these funds available to the Lahore Improve-
ment Trust for a period of 25 years, including a 5-1/2 year period of grace.
It has been assumed in the projections that the proposed IDA Credit, the
Swedish and goverrmient loans would be relent on terms and conditions similar
to the IDA Credit. Interest and amortization payments are assumed to be
payable semi-annually commencing December 31, 1972.
