AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION AND CROP DIVERSIFICATION PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:              Government of Grenada
Amount:                SDR 5.0 million (US$5.0 millio; equivalent)
Terms:                 Standard
Project Description:  The objectives of the proposed project are to:
rehabilitate crops and expand production; and
promote the marketing of crops for export, domestic
consumption and agroindustries. The project provides
for: (a) medium- and long-term credit to farmers and
agroindustries through the Grenada Development Bank
(GDB) with funding to be provided by the Caribbean
Development Bank (CDB); (b) upgrading and
institutional stengthening of existing support
services and infrastructure (Agriculture Extension
Service, Agricultural School, Plant Propagation Unit,
Plant Protection Unit, and marketing system); and
(c) the establishment of a feeder road maintenance-
-management system. These activities would be
supported by training, studies and technical
assistance.
Benefits and Risks:   The proposed project would assist directly some 800
to 1,000 farmers in rehabilitating their crop
production on about 1,250 ha. Most other farmers on
the island would benefit indirectly from the project
by receiving improved services (extension and
marketing) and by utilizing better roads and market
facilities. In addition, the proposed project would
have a beneficial effect on Grenada's balance of
payments by increasing agricultural exports and
reducing imports. The proposed project faces
moderate natural, technological, institutional and
marketing risks which are common for this kind of
project. However, it proposes a series of measures
to minimize these risks. These include implementing
on-farm drainage, soil conservation and plant
protection measures; increasing the supply of
agricultural inputs; and providing technical
assistance in institutional strengthening, and for
supporting the marketing system.

I. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Recent Economic Developments
1.01      Grenada experienced about 15' years of sustained economic recovery
in the wake of the massive destruction caused by Hurricane Janet in 1955.
However, economic activity declined in the early 1970s, partly as a result
of the demise of the estate system in the agricultural sector. The decline
in economic activity continued in 1974 because of the acute domestic crises
that accompanied Grenada's independence. In the following years, the
economy grew rapidly at an average real annual rate of 5% between 1975 and
1978, propelled by the agricultural and tourism sectors. A coup d'etat in
March 13, 1979, brought a new government, the People's Revolutionary
Government (PRG), to power in Grenada, and one of its stated objectives was
the elimination of what were perceived to be fundamental constraints to
economic development. PRG sought to establish trading links with Soviet
Bloc countries and expand the role of the public sector in agriculture,
manufacturing, commerce, and investment. However, the growth rate
progressively decelerated, and structural weaknesses began to appear.
Between 1979 and 1982, real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 3%.
However, preliminary estimates indicate that in 1983 real G'DP declined by
2%.
1.02      Since Grenada is a very open economy, price trends generally
reflect international inflation rates. In 1980/81 the average increase in
the consumer price index was 20% per annum, pushed up by the rise in
domestic food prices caused by hurricane damage. Inflation decelerated to
7.8% in 1982 and to 6.1% in 1983, aided also by the appreciation of the US
dollar (to which the EC$ is tied) against other major currencies.
1.03      The deficit in the current account of Grenada's balance of
payments widened rapidly from 1% of GDP in 1978 to 31% of GDP in 1982. The
main causes of the deterioration were: stagnant export earnings; hurricane
damage to agricultural production in 1980; price declines for Grenada's
major crops after 1980; a sharp increase in imports for the public sector
investment program; and a decline in tourism receipts. These deficits were
financed largely by foreign grants and concessionary loans to the public
sector. In 1981, Grenada also drew nearly US$6 million from the IMF
compensatory financing facility and a stand-by arrangement. Outstanding
public external debt in relation to GDP rose from 16.1% in 1978 to 28.7% in
1982. Because of the high grant component and concessional loan terms, the
debt servicing burden is still quite low: only 6.4% of the receipts from
exports of goods and nonfactor services.
B. Agriculture's Role in the National Economy
1.04      Agriculture plays a leading role in the Grenadian economy,
providing an important source of income, export earnings and employment.
In 1982, the sector's contribution to GDP was about ECS 95 million (US$35
million), or 25%. Of this amount about 75% came from four exported
commodities (bananas, cocoa, nutmeg and mace); the remaining 25% came from
other fruits and spices, vegetables, sugarcane, rootcrops and livestock
products.



- 2 -
1.05      In 1982, the f.o.b. value of exports from fresh, semi-processed
and processed agricultural products was EC$ 36.6 million (US$13.6 million),
or 73% of the country's total exports. Cocoa accounted for 34% of total
agricultural exports; bananas for 24%; nutmeg for 22%; mace for 7X; fruits
and vegetables for 12%; and agroindustrial products for 1X. However,
Grenada is heavily dependent on food imports; the c.i.f. value of food
imports in 1982 was ECS 41.5 million, about 13Z more than the value of all
agricultural exports.
1.06      At the end of 1983, Grenada had, according to official
statistics, a total population of about 92,000, with a relatively high
density rate of 270 persons per km2. The population is relatively young
and educated. According to the Agricultural Census of 1981, the
agricultural labor force, in that year including farm owners, was estimated
at some 12,500 workers, about one-third of the country's labor force. Of
the 8,200 farm owners, 49% were full-time farmers and 51% were p&rt-time.
About 31% of the part-time farmers worked as hired workers on other farms.
Despite the unemployment rate in urban areas, farm owners often complain of
difficulties in hiring workers, especially during the peak harvesting
season.
C. Agricultural Production and Resources
Climatic Conditions
1.07      Grenada is humid and tropical, with an annual average rainfall
ranging from 1,270 mm (50 inches) in the coastal lowlands to over 4,200 mm
(165 inches) in the mountainous interior (see Map IBRD 18410). The climate
is generally favorable for most agricultural activities and the island is
able to produce a wide range of crops throughout the year. However, there
are also the following drawbackq: moisture is deficient in certain areas
during the dry months, where supplementary irrigation could be helpful;
heavy rainfall and high winds on hillside and mountain areas create deep
gullies and contribute to soil erosion; and finally, hurricanes can cause
severe damage to agricultural property (see Annex 1 for details on climatic
conditions and land and water resources).
Land Area
1.08      Grenada's total area is 342 km2 (34,200 ha)l/.  Topography is
rugged, the amount of flat land is negligible, and only 29Z of the land has
a slope of 20 degrees or less. Although erosion generally constitutes a
threat, there is little evidence of serious erosion on agricultural lands,
probably because of the traditional system of tree crops closely planted in
mixed stands and the drainage systems constructed on many farms.
1/  Including the main island Grenada (305 km2) and the islands Carriacou,
Petit-Martinique and other islets.



-3-
1.09     In 1982, 55% of the total land area was considered agricultural
land, of which 9,920 ha (53% of agricultural land) were under permanent
tree crops, 4,330 ha (23%) were under temporary crops, and the remaining
4,574 ha (24%) were grassland, forest, woodland and other lands.
Land Tenure
1.10      Agriculture in Grenada is based predominantly on small farms; 46%
of all farms are under 1.0 acre (0.4 ha); 39% are between 1.0 and 5.0 acres
(0.4 and 2.02 ha); and 11% are larger than 5.0 acres. There are only 24
farm units larger than 100 acres (40.5 ha) each. Most farmers have title
of ownership to their lands and only 4% are landless (Table 1). In
addition to the private sector farms, the previous Government created new
kinds of publicly-owned farms: the state farms, which in 1981 covered some
1,350 ha. The future of these state farms is now being examined by a
government committee. The Government agreed to keep IDA informed of
decisions reached with regard to these farms as part of the annual
consultation with IDA on the Government's policies in the agricultural
sector (para. 1.25).
Production and Trend
.11      Agricultural production centers around three leading export
c2ops: cocoa, nutmeg (producing two commodities, nutmeg and mace) and
bananas. These crops are usually grown together in a mixed stand. The
estimated area planted with these crops is about 9,000 ha (compared to
18,800 ha of total agricultural land). Other crops include sugarcane,
coconuts, avocados, mangoes and vegetables (see Map IBRD 18411). In
general, agricultural production in Grenada has declined over the past ten
years, especially during 1979-83 when the Government imposed controls over
economic activities. The main reasons for this decline were depressed
world prices for the major export products during most of the period,
foreign exchange constraints which forced drastic redi'.tions In the use of
fertilizer and other chemicals, and the deterioration of the agricultural
supporting services.
1.12      At present, a six-year cocoa rehabilitation project is in its
third year of implementation with the assistance of the Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA).2/ Nutmeg and mace are
experiencing marketing problems and there are large quantities of unsold
stock.  The Government is trying, without much succes:, to explore
alternative markets for these two products. The proposed project would
therefore concentrate on production improvement in bananas, sugarcane,
coconuts and other tree and food crops (see Annex 2 for more details on the
present situation of these crops).
21 The project is progressing satisfactorily.



-4-
D. Support Services
Agricultural Extension
1.13      The Ministry of Agriculture, Lands, Forestry, Fisheries and
Tourism (MOA) provides extension services to farmers on the island. On the
average, there are about 300 farmers per extension agent (Table 2).
However, the service reaches only a small number of farmers as it has not
yet developed appropriate methods and suffers from a shortage of trained
manpower, vehicles and audio-visual equipment. Furthermore, the service
suffers from excessive staff turnover, due to lack of incentives and
motivation. Two of the commodity organizations (cocoa and bananas)
maintain their own crop-specific extension services. Their coordination
and cooperation with MOA's extension service are minimal. Moreover, the
officers of the commodity associations are involved in many other
activities (quality control, pre- and post-harvest regulatory tasks) and
therefore have little time for their extension work. The Agricultural
Extension Service of MOA is getting some support and assistance from the
Caribbean Agricultural Extension Project (CAEP) through the National
Agricultural Extension Improvement Plan (NAEIP) of Grenada. NAEIP is
funded by USAID, and it includes in-service training for extension
officers, overseas training, and assistance in preparing annual work
programs for the staff.
Agricultural Research
1.14      A limited amount of adaptive research is conducted by the
Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI), the
Caribbean Agricultural Research Development and Training Service (CARDATS)
and the Windward Islands Banana Growers Association (WINBAN). Although
limited, the adaptive research carried out is sufficient to deal with the
major practical problems faced by the farmers.
Plant Propagation
1.15      M04 operates a central propagating nursery at the Mirabeau
Agricultural Station, producing seedlings, root cuttings and saplings for
saie to farmers. The nursery produces high quality certified plants, but
production is not sufficient to meet the demand because of a shortage of
trained staff and lack of equipnent, material ard transport facilities.
Agricultural Credit
1.16      Farmers have access to credit from a variety of sources:  the
Grenada Development Bank (CDB); commercial banks; credit unions; commodity
associations; the National Agency of Cooperative Development (NACDA); and
informal sources, such as traders and suppliers. Cormercial hanks provide
the credit, which is primarily short-term, to a small group of large-scale
farmers to grow the trmditional export crops. However, the largest amount
of the so-cailed agricultural credit" goes to non-farm people to purchase
land for non-agricultural purposes. Only GDB and the rtural credit inions
provide significant amounts of medium- and long-term credit for on-farm
investmenrs.  By the end of 1982, total loans outstanding to agriculture,
including land purchase, amounted to ECS 10.3 millior (ITSS3.8 million) of
which about 4nl, was provided bv the commercial hanks (Table 3).



1.17      At present GDB and commercial banks lend at 11% for agriculture
and between 11.5% and 13% for other sectors. The domestic inflation rate
was 7.8% in 1982 and 6.1X in 1983. Farmers' demand for credit has been low
because of several reasons: high interest rates; low profitability in the
sector, which has led to insufficient financial incentives; available
alternative sources of informal credit (traders and suppliers); political
instability; and lack of promotion for proper use of agricultural credit.
There are indications, however, that with the changes in the political
situation and with support of an effective promotional program, farmers
would increase their demand for medium- and long-term credit, as they wish
to rehabilitate their farms and expand their production.
1.18      Of all the credit institutions operating in Grenada, only GDB has
trained staff who work fu]1 time on providing agricultural loans. Lack of
trained staff deters the commercial banks and other lending institutions
from increasing their participation in agricultural credit.
Input Supply
1.19      In recent years, the input supply system in Grenada has suffered
from a shortage of foreign exchange and the inefficiency of the
distribution system. Fertilizers and pesticides, the use of which has been
declining drastically, were supplied mainly by the Grenada Banana
Cooperative Society (GBCS). Rowever, supplies intended for bananas
were often diverted to other crops. Small-farm implements are sold in
privately owned hardware stores scattered throughout the island.
E. Infrastructure
Markets and Marketing Services
1.20      Grenada's agricultural commodities have been marketed through
three market outlets (the domestic market, the Trinidad market, and the
export market) and agroindustries.
(a) The domestic market is a small market for fresh fruits,
vegetables and root crops sold by farmers in the village market,
or by small traders, called -hucksters, in the town markets.
In recent years the Marketing and National Import Board (MNIB)
(para. 2.08) has tried to enter the wholesale end of this market;
however, despite introducing forward contracts to farmers with
minimum guaranteed prices, WIB has never covered more than 152
of the domestic market share. The main reasons for its small
share in the market are: lack of funds, and the sellers' and
buyers' belief that they can increase their profit through direct
negotiation in the traditional market place. An attempt was made
in the 1981 Agricultural Census to estimate the market
destination for farm produce (excluding bananas, nutmeg, cocoa
and minor spices) with the following results: 41% of the farmers
sold their produce in village markets; 30% in central markets;
21% to traffickers (who ship most of it to Trinidad, and also buy
in the village market); and only 8% sold to MNIB.



-6-
(b)  The Trinidad market is an important outlet for Grenada's fruits,
vegetables and root crops. A group of small individual
traffickers purchase the commodities in small quantities either
directly from the farmers or from the village and central
markets; load them on schooners (inter-island wooden or steel
vessels with 50-200 tons capacity) which travel to Trinidad (145
km southeast .;f Grenada) once a week; sell their commodities in
the city markets; and buy non-agricultural commodities to sell
back in Grenada's markets. However, the Trinidad market has
become much more difficult lately because of trade restrictions.
(c)  The export market is a good market outlet for fresh cr
semi-processed traditional export commodities of bananas, nutmeg
and mace, cocoa and minor spices. Trade is handled by commodity
associations including: GBCS (para. 2.10); the Grenada
Cooperative Nutmeg Association (GCNA); the Grenada Cocoa
Producers Association (GCA); and the Minor Spices Organization.
(d) Agroindustries are important outlets for raw sugarcane, copra and
coffee. These products are delivered by farmers as raw material
to the agroindustrial plants for processing. Prices paid to
farmers were previously established by the Government;
however, the Government's and industries' intention now is to
establish the price according to the market forces with only
Government monitoring (para. 1.25).
1.21      While the marketing systems for the traditional export crops are
organized and have most of the needed physical facilities, the traditional
marketing systems of vegetables and fruits (including the hucksters,
traffickers and MNIB) have numerous limitations and deficiencies, such as:
(a) lack of physical facilities, i.e., collection centers, packing and
storage facilities; (b) lack of accepted standards of sorting, grading and
packing; (c) lack of market information; (d) difficulties in
transportation; and (e) shortage of trained personnel.
School of Agriculture
1.22      The Mirabeau Agricultural Training School, the only one on the
island, was established in 1970 by MOA with the objective of training yc-mg
people in farming. Practical training is carried out on the school's 15-ha
farm. Although planned to provide a two-year study program, the school
provides only one-year programs at present. About 60 students are
currently attending the school. The school buildings and equipment, as
well as the study programs need upgrading.
Farm and Feeder Roads
1.23      Grenada has a road network of about 300 km of primary roads, 219
km of secondary roads, 384 km of tertiary roads and about 184 km of access
roads to agricultural areas and farms. Of the total of nearly 1,100 km,
approximately half are paved. Most of the farm and feeder roads in the
secondary and tertiary systems are gravel surfaced. Over the last decade,
the network, especially in agricultural areas, has deteriorated because of
a lack of maintenance.  As a result, motor vehicles cL-trt travel on many
feeder and farm roads, and losses of perishable produce are high.



-7-
1.24      The Ministry of Communications, Works, Civil Aviation, Energy and
Public Utilities (MOCW) is responsible for all roads, but, because of its
limited budget, it has a very erratic record of road maintenance. As a
result, the MOA, in cooperation with MOCW, has formed two maintenance
units-Farm Roads, financed by the Government, and Feeder Roads, financed
by the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB). However, this duplication has
resulted in a costly and inefficient maintenance program. The Government
proposed that MOCW reassume its role as the sole organization responsible
for road maintenance.
F. Government Policy
1.25      While PRG advocated tight control and a centrally planned
economy, the present elected Government supports a free market economy,
more private sector involvement and less govermment intervention in
economic and commercial activities. The liberalization of the economy by
the Interim Administration and the present Government extends to the
agricultural sector. The prices of most agricultural commodities are now
freely established by market forces. Similarly, subsidies on fertilizers
and chemicals have been removed. Export taxes on various agricultural
co odities (in 1983 the tax levels were: 18% of f.o.b. price for cocoa,
16Z for nutmeg and less than 1% for bananas) are being re-evaluated; a
complete removal, however, would be difficult given the weak fiscal
situation. However, with a view to ensuring adequate production
incentives, assurances were obtained during negotiations that the
Government would exchange views periodically with IDA on its policies
relating to the agricultural sector. The main weakneses of the
agricultural sector lie in the institutions that provide supporting
services: credit, extension and plant protection, marketing, training, and
farm and feeder road maintenance, and the inadequate availability of basic
inputs because of a shortage of foreign exchange. The proposed project
would assist the Government tn overcoming these weaknesses by addressing
the priority needs of the sector.
G. Bank Group Involvement in the Agricultural Sector
1.26      Until recently, there was no direct Bank Group involvement in
Grenada. An agricultural sector review, performed by a Bank Group
consultant in June 1982, called for the need for a agricultural
rehabilitation and crop diversification project.
II. THE EXECUTING AGENCIES
2.01      The agencies that are most active in carrying out the
Government's development objectives in the agricultural sector are: the
Ministry of Agriculture, the Grenada Development Bank, the Marketing and
National Import Board and the Grenada Banana Cooperative Society.



- 8 -
A. Ministry of Agriculture, Lands, Forestry, Fisheries and Tourism
2.02      The Ministry of Agriculture, Lands, Forestry, Fisheries and
Tourism (MOA) has the prime responsibility for the agricultural sector. It
has a suitable and effective organizational structure (Chart 1) that is now
being implemented. However, until recently, several important units were
inactive, and the two most important positions, those of the Permanent
Secretary and the Chief Technical Officer, were unfilled. The Interim
Administration filled the two positions.
2.03      At the field level, MOA communicates with farmers through its
five extension service field offices and through the various services that
MOA provides, such as supplying planting materials and farm machinery
services.
2.04      With the new management-level staff, MOA would be able to direct
and lead its development program and projects. However, some of its units
need support and strengthening. They are:
(a)  The Agricultural Extension Service, which has sufficient staff
but needs upgrading in terms of staff training, vehicles, office
facilities and instruction equipment;
(b) The Monitoring Unit, which is presently inactive and should be
re-established with existing staff or with newly recruited staff;
and
Cc) The Integrated Pest Control Unit, which is presently inactive and
should be re-established with newly recruited, trained staff and
equipment.
B. Grenada Development Bank
2.05      The objective of the Grenada Development Bank (GDB), owned by the
Government, is to promote investments in agriculture, industry, tourism and
fisheries. GDB has functioned as a channel for Government and Caribbean
Development Bank (CDB) monies via short-, mediur- and long-term fixed
interest loans to the private and public sectors. CDB supported GDB in its
institutional strengthening efforts; as a result, GDB succeeded in becoming
a well-organized bank with a core of trained staff. Its management
includes a Senior Agricultural Credit Officer, and there is an active
Agricultural Credit Department headed by a Farm Improvement Officer.
Staffing in the Agriculture Credit Department appears adequate for current
and future lending. In general, GDB appears to be well-prepared for
expansion of its loan portfolio (Annex 3 and Chart 2).
2.06      GDB's Statement of Income and Unrelieved Loss (Annex 3, Table 1)
indicates annual deficits of EC$ 135,000 (US$50,000) in 1982 and
EC$ 117,000 (US$43,000) in 1983. However, despite the deficits, which were
caused by bad debts, the financial performance of GDB has shown significant
improvement since 1979: annual subvention requirements decreased from
65.5% of expenditure in 1979 to 28.5% in 1982; average revenue on
outstanding subloans increased from 4.5% to 6.9%; and assets increased from



- 9 -
EC$ 2.1 million (US$0.8 million) in 1979 to EC$ 4.1 million (US$1.5
million) in 1982, and to EC$ 7.3 million (US$2.7 million) in 1983. The
long-term debt-to-equity ratio increased from 1.3:1 in 1979 to 2.5:1 in
1982.
2.07      The Government of Grenada decided that the GDB will continue to
be the financial tool for development investments in the country and handle
all national development projects. CDB will continue to follow up on
progress and to support the GDB's institutional strengthening and efforts
to improve its financial performance. GDB's financial performance and
medium term forecasts were reviewed during negotiations.
C. Marketing and National Import Board
2.08      The Marketing and National Import Board (MNIB) is a statutory
body established by the Government with the objectives of (a) handling and
marketing agricultural produce of Grenada which is not already marketed
under another statutory organization; and (b) importing foodstuffs and
agricultural inputs. In practice, MNIB markets only a small share of the
fruits, vegetables and rootcrops produced on the island, imported basic
foodstuffs and limited quantities of agricultural inputs (see Annex 4 for
details on MNIR activities and organizational structure).
2.09      The Government decided that, in the absence of other agencies
dealing with wholesale marketing of farm produce, MNIB will remain the
Government's principal agency to carry out the task, but without monopoly
power. Furthermore, the Government has expressed interest in having the
private sector enter into the wholesale trade of agricultural products. To
date, MNIB's management has been weak and has caused financial losses to
the organization. Therefore, in order to carry out its task effectively,
MNIB shouJd be reorganized. The reorganization has started with the
assistance of a consultant, wbo paid particular attention to the financial
difficulties. However, add.ltional institutional strengthening and
reorganization are necessary. The main features of the reorganization of
the agricultural sections would include concentrating the agricultural
marketing activities in one division. In addition, a procurement unit
would buy the farm produce from the farmers and would introduce them to
advanced post-harvest methods. MNIB's financial situation and medium-term
projections were reviewed during negotiations, and the proposed measures to
improve the financial position appear feasible.
D. Grenada Banana Cooperative Society
2.10      The Grenada Banana Cooperative Society (GBCS) is a growers'
society with the main objective of exporting bananas. The society is given
the po-wer to fix growers' prices, to impose levies to cover specific needs
of the cooperative and to regulate the grading of bananas. GBCS purchases
bananas from farmers, treats, packs and exports them under contract through
Geest Industries, Ltd. (a large shipping company which is responsible for
marketing East Caribbean Islands bananas to the UK). The organizational
structure of GBCS is simple and adequate to carry out its tasks (Annex 5).



- 10 -
However, some measures, such as improvement of the accounting and cost
accounting systems and installation of radio communications system, are
still needed to strengthen the institution. GBCS has already initiated
steps to implement these improvements.
2.11      The financial conditions of GBCS cause concern because it
incurred deficits in all but one (1982) of the last six years.. The 1983
deficit was EC$ 174,000 (US$64,000). GBCS's financial situation and
medium-term projections were reviewed during negotiations, and the proposed
measures to improve the financial situation appear feasible.
III. THE PROJECT
3.01      The Government of Grenada requested Bank Group support in 1982
for an agricultural rehabilitation and crop diversification project, which
would expand and promote production of traditional and non-traditional
crops.   After defining the needs of assistance and support to the
agricultural sector in March 1983, the Government asked the FAO/CP
Investment Center to assist in project preparation. A preparation mission
visited the island during May-June 1983. However, due to the political
events in the country in October 1983, the preparation report was delivered
to the Interim Administration only in January 1984. The report formed the
basis for an IDA appraisal mission in May 1984. A list of studies and
working papers related to the project is given in Annex 9. The project has
been designed in accordance with the Government's strategy which aims to
increase agricultural production, accelerate economic growth, increase
foreign exchange earning and create employment.
A. Objectives
3.02      The overall objectives of the project are to:  (a) rehabilitate
crops and expand production, thus rebuilding the production capacity of the
island; and (b) promote marketing of crops for export, domestic
consumption, and local agroindustries. The project would provide the
support activities and infrastructure necessary for the rehabilitation of
existing crops as well as planting of new ones.
B. Brief Description
3.03      The project would seek to achieve the stated objectives over five
years by:
(a) providing mediumr- and long-term credit to farmers and
agroindustries through GDB with CDB funding;3/
3/ CDB would cofinance the project, taking responsibility for the
agricultural credit component.



- 11 -
(b) upgrading and institutional strengthening of existing support
services, including the Agricultural Extension Service, the
Agricultural School, the Plant Propagation Unit, the Plant
Protection Unit and marketing organizations;
(c) assisting the agroindustrial sector and marketing organizations
by financing feasibility studies, and marketing studies;
Cd) establishing a farm and feeder road maintenance management system
with necessary equipment and material/soil laboratory.
The above activities would be supported by training, studies and technical
assistance.
3.04      The crops needing medium- and long-term financing and/or other
support that would be included in the project are: bananas, sugarcane,
coconuts, coffee, tropical fruits (avocados, mangoes and other fruits),
vegetables and ornamental plants and cut flowers. Other crops and
activities might be included in the project, on a case-by-case basis,
subject to investigation with regard to economic viability and market
prospects.
3.05      Direct project beneficiaries would be 800 to 1,000 farmers
(including a group of 50-100 Grenadian repatriates), who would receive
credit and other support services for that purpose. In principle, any
qualified farmer, small-scale or large-scale, who engages in producing the
above crops would be eligible to receive credit and support activities
under the project. However, the State Farms would not be direct
beneficiaries of this project because they are Government-controlled
entities; their future is now being examined. In addition to the direct
project beneficiaries, the majority of the country's other farmers
(estimated at about 5,000 farmers) are expected to be indirect project
beneficiaries, as they too would enjoy the improved services, from such
units as the Agricultural Extension Service, Plant Protection Unit, and
marketing orgarizations. They also would benefit from using the improved
feeder and farm roads, and marketing facilities.
C. Detailed Features
Crop Rehabilitation and Expansion
3.06      The project would provide mediumr and long-term credit and other
support activities to rehabilitate and expand crops over an estimated
1,250 ha (about 3,090 acres) during the five-year project period, as
presented in Table 3.1 below and in Table 4.

tropical fruits.
The above figures are indicative and should be considered as a framework
for the project and flexible guideline for its implementation. Details on
project activities recommended for each crop are presented in Annex 6.
Line of Credit
3.07      Medium- and long-term credit, estimated at EC$ 5.2 million
(US$1.9 million), would be on-lent to farmers and agroindustries by GDB
through funds provided by CDB. The estimated credit need to farmers (Table
5) is based on an agricultural plan, which envisages development on roughly
1,250 ha, with an estimated on-farm investment of EC$ 5.9 million (US$2.2
million) during the project's first five years. It is projected that from
the total amount to be invested on-farm, only 75% would be provided in the
form of credit. It is therefore envisaged that the amount of medium- and
long-term credit to farmers would be EC$ 4.4 million (US$1.6 million).
Although in previous years demand for credit in the agricultural sector was
low (para. 1.17), discussions with farmers and officials of MOA and
bankers, confirm the existence of demand 'or the kind of credit proposed.
Furthermore, project management, GDB, tne agroindustries and the Extension
Service would initiate a program to promote medium- and long-term credit
among farmers. In addition to the credit for on-farm investment, a line of
credit of about EC$ 800,000 (US$296,000) would be available to the
agroindustries for reva!rs, renewal of equipment and renovations, according
to the recommendations of the feasibility studies supported by the project
(para. 3.13). The agroindustries to be inicluded are the sugar and rum
factory (Grenada Sugar Factory, Ltd.), the coconut oil factory (TEMPE
Manufacturing Company Ltd.) and the coffee processing plant.
3.08      The CDB loan would normally finance an average of 75Z of the
estimated investment costs up to a maximum of 80%, excluding the cost of
land, and the maximum loan ceiling for a single farm beneficiary or a
single agroindustry would be ECS 540,000 (US$200,000). All sub-loans would
have to be adequately secured, according to CDB criteria.  GDB would



- 13 -
provide the following lines of credit to project beneficiaries, depending
on the nature of crop involved and the type of activity in the
agroindustry:
Type of Loan            Maximum Loan Term       Maximum Grace Period
(years)                  (months)
On-Farm Medium-Term              5                        24
On-Farm Long-Term               10                        48
Agroindustry                    10                        36
All subloans would be appraised by GDB staff. However, subloans above
EC$100,000 (US$37,000) would require prior approval of CDB. About 25-30
such loans are expected to be implemented.
3.09      CDB's loan to GDB would be within the proposed CDB consolidated
line of credit to GDB, guaranteed by the Government of Grenada, given to
the agricultural, fishing, industry and tourism sectors. The loan would be
for 20 years, including a five-year grace period, at 4% interest. GDB
would on-lend the funds to project beneficiaries in East Caribbean dollars
at an interest rate of 10.5%, thus giving GDB a 6.5% spread, an amount GDB
considers adequate to cover its administrative costs and risks. The
foreign exchange risk would be borne by the Government. As a condition of
effectiveness, IDA would be notified by CDB, that all conditions precedent
to the first disbursement of the CDB loan, have been fulfilled.
Physical Facilities for Upgrading Support Services
3.10      The project would provide base cost funds of about ECS 4.9
million (USS1.8 million) for structures, vehicles and equipment to the
following entities (see Annex 7 for details):
(a) MOA: structures, vehicles and equipment at a total value of
EC$ 1,803,500 (US$668,000) for the following units and
infrastructure: the Agricultural Extension Service (equipment
would also serve the agricultural school), Plant Propagation Unit
and Plant Protection Unit, and Marketing Infrastructure;
(b) MNIB: structures, vehicles and equipment at a total value of
ECS 999,000 (US$370,000);
(c) GBCS: vehicles and equipment at a total value of ECS 327,000
(US$121,000); and
(d) MOCW: vehicles and equipment at a total value of EC$ 1,780,000
(US$659,300).
3.11      The Government would on-lend IDA credit funds to MNIB and GBCS
for construction, vehicles and equipment. The on-lending would be for ten
years with a three-year grace period at the same interest rate set for
agricultural loans. The Government would bear the foreign exchange risk.
Contractual arrangements between the Gove-rnment, MNIB and GBCS to this
effect, satisfactory to IDA, would be a condition for effectiveness.



- 14 -
3.12      The Government proposed that it would lease the vehicles to
relevant agricultural extension staff of MOA and MNIB under terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA. Assurances to that effect were obtained
during negotiations.
Studies
3.13      The project would finance surveys, marketing and feasibility
studies at an estimated base cost value of EC$ 378,000 (US$140,000), which
would include:
(a) technical and economic feasibility studies for upgrading and
renovation of, and equipment renewal for, the sugar and coconut
oil factories.
(b) marketing studies, mainly for export crops and, in particular,
for non-traditional crops, such as vegetables, ornamental plants
and cut flowers, to provide guidelines for penetrating new export
markets;
(c)  management audit studies to review the managerial and organiza-
tional situation in the participating executing agencies (MNIB
and GBCS) and to provide guidelines for the necessary managerial
assistance; and
(d) optimal resource utilization on family-owned or operated farms.
3.14      Prior to execution of each study, the project management would
present to IDA a detailed study program, including the executor (most
studies would be executed by internationally recruited consultants) and the
scope and terms and conditions for execution of the study. The
recommendations of the studies (except for the feasibility studies for the
agroindustries) will be carried out in a manner and in accordance of
timetable satisfactory to IDA. Assurances to that effect were obtained
during negotiations.
3.15      Two of the above-mentioned studies would be performed during the
first project year: (a) a feasibility study of rehabilitation needs for
the sugar and rum factory (Grenada Sugar Factory, Ltd.); and (b) a
feasibility study of renewal and upgrading of the machinery and equipment
at the coconut oil factory (TEMPE Manufacturing Co., Ltd.). The studies
would be presented to IDA for review by June 30, 1986. Assurances to that
effect were obtained during negotiations.
Technical Assistance
3.16      The project would provide funds for 124 man-months of technical
assistance (not to include consultant services for the above studies) to
strengthen MOA's field units and the services of the participating
executing agencies. More specifically, the technical assistance would
provide the following support:
(a) Project Management Specialist (24 man-months). The main function
of the project management specialist would be to advise and
assist the project management in carrying out the project
implementation.



- 15 -
(b) Agricultural Extension Specialist (24 man-months). Particular
attention would be given to upgrading the Extension Service by
providing in-service training to the extension staff members,
introducing them to advanced extension methods and systems, and
applying audio-visual techniques. Extension work would be
complementary to the credit program, providing field guidance to
project beneficiaries in their execution of the crop
rehabilitation and expansion programs. Thus, the extension
agents would have to work in close contact with the field
agronomist, as well as the field marketing specialist, in
improving the post-harvest methods. The extension specialist
would also provide support to the banana extension officers, with
the intention of amalgamating the crop-specific extension service
with the general extension service.
(c)  Field Agronomist (24 man-months).  A field agronomist would
assist the Plant Propagation Unit in expanding its capacity to
meet the growing demand for planting materials. He would also
help to reactivate the Plant Protection Unit and work with the
extension officers in the field.
Cd) Agricultural Education Specialist (4 man-months). An
agricultural education specialist would be employed on a
short-term assignment to assist in revising the study program in
the agricultural school to answer the growing need for young,
well-trained farmers.
Ce) Marketing-Specialist (24 man-months). The marketing specialist's
main function would be to assist in improving and introducing new
methods of post-harvest field activities, namely, sorting,
grading, packing and transporting farm produce.
(f) Management Consultants (12 man-months). Management consultants
would assist the participating executing agencies (especially
MNIB and GBCS) in carrying out programs identified by the
management audit studies to strengthen their operations. All
participating agencies have already started other activities to
strengthen their institutions, and some of them are already
receiving technical assistance from other sources.
(g)  Feeder Road Engineer (9 man-months).  A feeder road engineer
would be assigned to assist in developing a maintenance
management system (Annex 8).
(h) Soil Engineer (3 man-months). A soil engineer would be assigned
to assist in equipping, operating, and developing standards in
the soil/materials laboratory.
3.17      The technical assistance would be provided by internationally
recruited consultants, who would work with local counterparts. Information
on proposed consultants is presented in Table 6. Vehicles and office
facilities would be provided to the field technical assistance staff.
During negotiations the Government presented the proposed terms of
reference for the consultants, which were reviewed and agreed.



- 16 -
Training
3.18      Technical and managerial training would be provided locally or
overseas, at an estimated base cost of EC$ 226,000 (US$84,000). The
training would be on-the-job (mainly for extension agents) and in the form
of short courses on various technical subjects related to crop production
and export marketing, such as: (a) plant protection methods; (b) soil
conservation measures; (c) product quality control; (d) packing
agricultural products for export; (e) shipment of products for export;
(f) related issues of agricultural credit; and (g) extension methods of
transferring knowledge and information. Individual training would be
provided overseas to specialists working on this project on specific
subjects, such as ornamental plant production, plant protection, export
marketing, etc. In addition, the Extension Service would conduct short
courses and seminars for farmers on various agricultural subjects. The
training program would be carried out by trained local staff and
specialists and by expatriate consultants. MOA's Agricultural Training
Division would be responsible for planning and implementation of the
training program. A detailed annual training program would be prepared by
the Government not later than November 30 of each year and presented to
IDA. Assurances to that effect were obtained during negotiations. The
Government prepared a detailed training program for the first project year,
that program was reviewed and agreed during negotiations. Selection of
suitable candidates for overseas training and the designation of
institutions for such training would be done according to criteria
satisfactory to IDA. Assurances to that effect were obtained during
negotiations.
IV. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
A. Cost Estimate
4.01      The total project cost, based on May 1984 prices, over the
five-year project period (1985-1990) is estimated at EC$ 21.4 million, or
US$7.9 million, including a foreign exchange cost of US$5.6 million, or 70%
of the total.   Of the total project costs, 71% are investment items and
29% are incremental recurrent costs (including consultants service under
the technical assistance). The tax element is negligible in total costs,
as the project would benefit from a tax incentive program, which largely
eliminates import taxes on eligible items. No physical contingencies were
computed for the line of credit; however, for other components, physical
contingency allowances vary from 5% to 12% (depending on the nature of the
cost item) of the baseline costs. No price contingencies were computed for
the line of credit, but for other components price contingencies were
calculated in US dollar terms based on forecast international inflation
rates of 8% for 1985 and 9% annually for 1986 and after. Local inflation
is assumed to be only somewhat lower than international inflation and is
expected to average about 8% annually during 1985-1990. The project cost
summary is given in Table 4.1 below, and the annual phasing is detailed in
Table 7.

B. Financing
4.02       The proposed IDA Credit of US$5.0 million to the Government of
Grenada would cover 63% of the total project costs. Of the balance, 24% of
the project cost would be provided by CDB, 5% by the Government and 8% by
participating farmers. The proposed financing scheme for the project is
given in Table 4.2 below:

4.03       Because of the difficult financial situation of the Government
and the extended development needs in all sectors of the economy, the
Government of Grenada would finance only about 41% of local project cost
(except the on-farm and agroindustrial investments). In addition, the
Government is expected to allocate adequate operating funds for the various
project activities after project completion, so that farmers would continue
to enjoy the benefits of the project after the IDA Credit has been
disbursed.

C. Procurement
4.04      Equipment and vehicles, for the non-credit components, with
individual contract values of US$50,000 (EC$ 135,000) or more, would be
purchased by the agencies responsible for the various project components
following International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with IDA
guidelines. On purchases valued at less than US$50,000 each, but in
aggregate not to exceed US$600,000 (EC$ 1.6 million), International and/or
Local Shopping (ILS) would be allowed after obtaining at least three price
quotations from local or international suppliers. Under the credit
component, sub-borrowers would procure goods and services for their
activities from local channels or international suppliers under CDB's
procurement procedures, which are satisfactory.
4.05      Civil works for an estimated total value of EC$ 3.4 million
(US$1.2 million) would be carried out partly by force account4/ and partly
by Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures, which are acceptable to
IDA. The relatively small size of the civil works operations in the
project makes it unlikely that non-Grenadian contractors would be willing
to compete for bids for civil works; however, they would not be excluded
from bidding. Local contractors are available.
4.06      Consultants for technical assistance, studies and training at an
estimated value of US$1.8 million (EC$ 4.8 million) would be contracted as
individuals or through consulting firms, in accordance with IDA guidelines
for the use of consultants.
4.07      Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4.3 below.

- 19 -
D. Disbursements
4.08      The proceeds of the IDA Credit would be disbursed against:
(a) 1002 of foreign expenditures and 902 of local expenditures for
equipment and vehicles (US$1,000,000);
(b)  100% of tctal expenditures for studies, technical assistance and
training (US$1,0'35,000);
(c) 80% of total expenditures for civil works, and operations of the
feeder road maintenance (US$1,100,000); and
(d) 90-50X5/ of incremental operating costs (US$560,000).
Ia addition, there will be a Revolving Fund (special Account) of US$500,000
and unallocated amount of US$755,000.
4.09      The estimated schedule of Credit disbursements (five years) is
presented in Table 8. The schedule is based on the disbursement profile
for Bank-supported agricultural credit projects in the Latin America and
the Caribbean Region. However, the one exception to the profile is that
the duration of the project will be five years, instead of seven or eight,
because: (a) the project is small and does not justify extension beyond
five years; and (b) GDB, which is the major participating agency and has
been working during the last four years under the guidance of the CDB, is
strong enough to carry out the project on schedule. Disbursement would be
carried out under full documentation, except for: incremental operating
costs; works carried out by force account; and expenditure against
contracts for goods and services with a value of US$10,000 equivalent or
less.
V. PROJECT IMPLEM-NTATION
A. Coordination and Management
5.01      MOA would have overall responsibility for the project but would
also delegate authority for implementation to other participating agencies
and institutions. The organization chart for project management and
operations is presented in Chart 3. The highest project authority would be
the Project Board of Management, headed by the Minister of Agriculture or
his delegate. Members of the Board would be representatives of relevant
Government departments and all participating agencies. The Board of
Management would hav@ the authority to make operational decisions and would
guide the project implementation staff in the desired course of action.
5/ The Government of Grenada will gradually increase its participation in
the project expenditures of that category; the proceeds of the IDA
Credit would therefore be disbursed against: 9O% of the first
US$240,000; 70X of the next US$240,000; and 50% of the remaining
US$50,000.



- 20 -
5.02      The Project Board of Management would supervise two main areas:
(a) the credit component, under the direct responsibility of the GD6, which
would channel credit to farmers and agroladustries; and (b) all other
non-credit project activities, for which responsibility would be vested in
NOA through the newly established Project Management Unit (PHU), a small
unit comprising the project coordinator and a two-member administrative
staff.
5.03      The PMU would undertake day-to-day coordination and
administration (i.e., updating annual planning, adjusting initially agreed
target activities to actual circumstances, reporting, and liaison with
IDA). The project coordinator would report directly to the head of the
Project Board of Management.
5.04      The PMIJ would receive support from a number of units in MOA as
well as from other Government units and agencies which are traditionally
responsible for certain activities: in MOA, (a) the Project Monitoring
Section (para. 5.05); (b) the Accounts Unit (para. 5.07); (c) the
Agricultural Extension Service, which would coordinate and provide support
to farmers in their implementation of the rehabilitation and expansion
program; Cd) the Plant Propagation Unit, which would supply saplings and
seedlings to the planting program; (e) the Integrated Pest Control Unit,
which would have the capacity of a plant protection advisory unit and
coordinate all plant protection activities; and (f) the Agricultural
Training Division, which would coordinate and activate the training program
of the project and coordinate the project support to the agricultural
school. Other Government departments and participating agencies would be:
(a) the Accounting and Auditing Divisions of the Ministry of Finance, Trade
and Planning (MOF) (para. 5.07); (b) MOCW, which would be responsible for
the implementation of the feeder road maintenance of the project and
cooperate with a liaison officer from MOA, who would indicate the needs and
priorities in road maintenance to be developed as part of this project;
Cc) MNIB, which would coordinate the project's investments and activities
in the marketing component; and 'd) GBCS, which would coordinate the field
activities related to banana rehabilitation. The proposed implementation
schedule would be as shown in Chart 4. A condition for effectiveness would
be that the Government establish the Project Board of Management and the
PMU.
B. Monitoring and Reporting
5.05      The PMU would establish a project monitoring system designed to
serve mainly as a management tool, or  management information system.  The
system would be operated by the presently inactive Project Monitoring
Section of MOA, which would be reorganized and strengthened. The
monitoring unit would collect and analyze data on project achievements in
comparison with targets. It would provide information in the right
quantities at the right level, to alert management to problems as they may
emerge, and to provide a basis for the annual planning exercise. Initial
indicators and time-phased targets established prior to project execution
would provide a benchmark for comparison of targets and actual results.
The executing agencies would provide information to the PMU on a quarterly
basis, and these reports would be consolidated into the trimestral progress
report to MOA and IDA. Progress reports would provide a comparison of
numerical targets with actual performance (in terms of key actions



- 21 -
completed in physical, financial and adoption terms), as well as PMUI
comments on special problems and the steps taken to overcome these
problems. The progress report should be designed to fulfill most of the
information needs for IDA supervision. In addition, agricultural
production information would be collected and compared with the stated
production targets. Reports would be prepared as described and sent to IDA
no later than three months after the end of each quarter. GDB would also
report to CDB periodically with copies to IDA.
5.06      Project evaluation activities, separated from the monitoring
function, would involve periodic in-depth assessments of the project
impact, including the effect of credit, support services and
infrastructure, on the production capacity of the project beneficiaries.
The monitoring data and the evaluation results generated under the project
would provide information for preparing the Project Completion Report which
would be sent to IDA within six months after the Closing Date.
C. Accounts and Auditing
5.07      Two separate accounts would be maintained for the project.  The
first would be related to the credit lirne and be under the responsibility
of GDB. The system would enable the management to frequently review levels
and trends of loan sizes and bad debts and also to produce up-to-date
Information and enable accounts to be finalized at the end of each
accounting period. The second account, for all other project expenditures,
would be under the responsibility of the PMU and wou'ld he maintained in the
Accounts Unit of MOA. This account would record MOA's own project
expenditures as well as the expenditures of each participating agency,
except GDB. At the end of each month, the accounts would be delivered to
the Central Accounting Unit at MOF. The account would be audited annually
by independent auditors. The Constitution of Grenada provides that
government accounts be audited by the Office of the State Auditor, an
independent body responsible to Parliament. However, at present, the State
Auditor is not yet adequately staffed, and the project accounts will be
audited by accounting firm acceptable to IDA. The audit reports would
include specific reference to the adequacy of procedures used for
verification and preparation of documentation or statements of expenditure
for disbursement requests. The Government would forward audited accounts
to IDA, within four months of the end of each fiscal year.
5.08      A Revolving Fund (Special Account) of USS500,000 would be
established in a commercial bank. The purpose of the fund would be to
maintain an adequate flow of funds available to the project entity for
financing expenditures for specified project components with a minimum of
administrative delay.
VI. PRODUCTION, DEMAND, MARKET AND PRICES

6.02      At full development the combined annual value of the incremental
production for all crops is expected to be US$2.3 million at farm-gate
prices and US$3.6 million f.o.b. at port of exit for the export crops or
c.i.f. port of entry for crops or commodities which substitute for imports.
B. Demand, Market and Prices
Bananas
6.03      GBCS coordinates its marketing efforts through its membership in
WINBAN, which negotiates the sale of bananas to the UK on behalf of the
four Windward Islands. The annual quota, under the Lome Convention, is
approximately 120,000 tons, of which Grenada's share is 20,000 tons.
However, the islands have not met their quota since 1978 and Grenada has
not met its share since 1970 (Table 9). Since Grenada presently cannot
fulfill its UK market quota, no attempt has been made to explore other
market opportunities. With the assistance of the project, annual exports
would increase by an estimated 5,000 tons, which would increase the 1983
production level by about 36X and bring Grenada closer to its UK market
quota.
6.04      The price paid in 1983 by Geest Industries, Ltd., the sole
marketing agent for exporting bananas from the Windward Islands to the UK,
was US$366 (EC$ 988) per ton at St. George's port. This is a relatively
satisfactory price level, which could-bring some profit to efficient
growers if the post-harvest activities are also handled efficiently.



- 23 -
Sugar and Rum
6.05      The entire production of sugar and rum is allocated to the local
market. In recent years, Grenada has become an importer or sugar, despite
its capability to produce for its own needs. In 1983 approximately 3,760
tons of sugar were imported at a total value of EC$ 3.2 million (US$1.2
million) and the local sugar industry produced only rum, which was sold
locally and could not satisfy all demands. In addition to local
production, rum is imported into the country in unknown quantities at an
average price of ECS 3.8 per liter at the port of entry. Domestic retail
prices for local and imported rum are the same. However, since the sugar
factory can easily convert from rum production to sugar production and vice
versa, this option provides the Government and factory management with the
opportunity to decide whether to produce sugar or rum, or a combination of
both, depending on the world price for sugar. Presently, Grenada is paying
US$305 per ton of imported sugar, a lower price than the cost of production
in Grenada. Therefore, it is clear that at the present depressed world
prices, the country is better off to import sugar or molasses. However,
considering medium- and long-term World Bank price projections, sugar
prices are expected to increase from 1986 onwards, and the prospects for
sugar production are encouraging in relation to the alternative of
importing. Although the project would more than double the amount of cane
sold to the main factory (which presently operates at a low capacity and
can absorb the entire proposed amount of sugarcane), the entire production
of either sugar or rum could be absorbed by the local market without posing
any marketing problem. The private mills also operate below their
production capacity and can increase their demand for sugarcane
substantially.
Coconuts
6.06      Domestic demand for coconut oil and products is growing, but only
a small portion is derived from local manufacturing. The rest is imported,
either in the form of a finished product or as base oil for blending. In
1983 Grenada paid US$760 per ton of imported coconut oil; the cost of local
production was somewhat lower, averaging around EC$ 1,900 per ton (about
US$700 per ton). When the project reaches full production, the local
manufacturer could supply the entire country with about 450 tons of coconut
oil and products per year. The project would then double the amount of
copra sold to the local manufacturer and of dry coconut sold by the
official trade organization and by private traders. The factory is
presently operating below capacity (Annex 2); with its potential production
capacity, it could absorb the entire amount of copra to be produced by the
project.
Coffee
6.07      Presently, raw coffee beans are imported from Trinidad at a high
price of US$3.7 per kg and are processed at a local plant. Only small
quantities of local coffee beans reach the processing plants and the price
paid to producers varies; however, this price is somewhat lower than the
price paid for the imported beans. The 16 ha of coffee proposed under the
project would supply most of the island's consumption needs, thus saving
foreign exchange spent on coffee.



2-  4 -
Tropical Fruits
6.08      Until recently, only small quantities of mangoes were exported to
the UK. However, the opportunity exists for exporting other tropical
fruits, and there is good market potential in the US and Europe for various
fruits, especially avocados and mangoes. There is no doubt that the small
quantities produced by the project would be sold in the export markets
without any particular marketing problems, if they are of high quality and
appropriate varieties and if transportation can be arranged in combination
with the shipment of bananas, nutmeg and cocoa. Production increase and
markets would be explored and studied with some project assistance.
Vegetables
6.09      Commercial exporting of vegetables would also be a relatively new
operation in Grenada. The country's favorable year-round climate would
permit production and supply of small quantities to the nS and Europe
during the winter season. However, because of some uncertainties with
regard to the market, and because of the need for a strong marketing
organization, the project would start with a modest vegetable area
(estimated at 10 ha) on an experimental basis, which could later be
expanded if justified by production ability and by the market situation.
Small quantities of exported vegetables could be shipped in containers,
loaded on ships exporting bananas, nutmeg or cocoa, which leave the island
frequently. With the initiation of vegetable production, potential markets
would be explored and studied under the project.
Ornamental Plants and Cut Flowers
6.10      There is good market potential in the US and Europe for
orna.;ental plants and cut flowers. However, the project would start with
plant and flower production on a small scale (estimated at 2 ha), until
further penetration of the international market could be developed.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Production Unit Models
7.01      The project area is island-wide, and each of the proposed seven
project crops would be grown in suitable locations. Based on field surveys
and observations, several production unit models, representing the project
costs, were studied. The models assumed that the participant farmers would
have access to sufficient credit to purchase required inputs and to
implement the necessary on-farm investments and would be supported by the
extension system. Discussions on projected crop yields and agrotechnical
recommendations are presented in Annex 6, and assumptions for the
production unit models on input application and yields in Table 10. The
farm unit model size is presented in Table 7.1 below.

7.02      Financial analysis was applied to each model unit.  The results
are presented in Table 11, which gives the net annual return at full
development without the project and with the project. The analysis also
provides the financial rates of return, which are given in Table 7.2 below:

VIII. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Benefits and Justification
8.01      The proposed project would finance agricultural rehabilitation
and expansion for export and local- agroindustry. It would thus bring about
a turning point and complement the Government's efforts to reverse the
decline in agricultural production, to rebuild the production capacity of
the island, to increase foreign exchange earnings and savings and to
improve the balance of payments.
8.02      The proposed project would ensure availability of financing for
the agricultural sector and would help rebuild the support services and
infrastructure needed for proper production and efficient export and import
substitution. It would also strengthen the various institutions dealing
with marketing and exporting of agricultural products.
8.03      The project would assist some 800 to 1,000 farmers who would be
direct project beneficiaries receiving credit to invest on their farm. The
benefits of this group, which comprises about 10-12% of the entire farm
population in Grenada, would be measured and evaluated. It is expected
that the majority of the other farmers on the island would also benefit
from the project through the extension service, the improved market
facilities, better roads and other project activities. However, their
benefits would be hard to measure and, therefore, cannot be included in the
economic rate of return analysis presented below.
B. Economic Rate of Return
8.04      The economic rate of return for the directly productive aspects
of the project has been estimated at 21%. Details of the cost and benefit
streams assumed in the economic analysis are given in Table 12 and are
discussed below.
8.05      The cost stream used in the economic evaluation of productive
activities would include: (a) all on-farm investments; (b) all incremental
operating costs of on-farm production activities; (c) investments in
support services and infrastructure needed to support the project's
agricultural production activities; (d) incremental operating costs
directly related to these services during the four-year project
implementation period; and (e) recurrent costs of services and maintenance
of infrastructure necessary to sustain project development for 15 years
after the first 5 years of project implementation. The services and
infrastructure would serve the entire agricultural sector, rather than only
the crop area directly involved in the project. Therefore, the cost stream
includes 602 of project costs for civil works, equipment, training,
studies, technical assistance and maintenance, and 30% of the investment
and operating costs of feeder road maintenance. The internal rate of
return calculation thus covers 65% of total project costs.



- 27 -
8.06      The benefit stream includes all the net incremental production
from the prolect to be sold in the market or to the local agroindustry.  It
is phased according to the expected timing of farmer participation in the
project.
8.07      The prices used in the economic analysis have the following
characteristics: (a) for the exported commodities, namely bananas,
tropical fruits, vegetables, ornamental plants and cut flowers, the prices
used are the international prices adjusted to take into account transport,
handling and insurance costs; and (b) products produced under the prolect
and directed to the local agroindustry, namely sugarcane, coconuts and
coffee, are valued at the price of imported finished products, including
sugar, rum, coconut oil and coffee, adjusted to take into account,
processing, transport, handling and insurance costs. Most of the prices
are expected to remain stable over the next decade; however, a reduction
was applied for bananas and an increase was applied for sugar in accordance
with the World Bank price projections. In pricing labor, the current
market wages were used.
8.08      To measure the impact of possible changes in the economic
environment on the project's stream of costs and benefits, several
sensitivity tests were made. The results of the most significant are
presented in Table 8.1 below.
Table 8.1: ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN AND SWITCHING VALUES
Best estimate          : 21%      Benefits down by 10%
and costs up by 10% : 6%
All costs up by 10%   : 14%       Benefits lag 1 year  : 12%
All cost up by 20%    : 8%        Benefits lag 2 years : 9%
Benefits down by 10%  : 13%       Switching Values at 12.5%
Benefits down by 20%  : 5%        Benefits Down         : 11%
Costs Up              : 12%
The estimated return of the project would be sensitive to possible
variations in costs and benefits. However, even with a likely reduction in
benefit by 10%, lags in benefits of up to one year, or cost increase by
10%, the rate of return would be still at a satisfactory level (12% or
above). These results reflect the project situation, a small size project
with a high proportion of investments not directly related to the
production units.
C. Employment
8.09      The proposed project is expected to generate annually at full
development some 77,000 working days, of which about 62,500 would be
incremental, equivalent to about 250 new jobs. This contribution, if



- 28 -
handled properly, could be of great assistance to the island's economy,
which faces severe unemployment. The creation of new job opportunities
could ease unemployment and contribute to reductions of underemployment in
the agricultural sector. However, since the agricultural sector suffers
from seasonal shortage of labor and underemployment, the matter should be
carefully dealt with by the authorities. In addition, the project would
create employment opportunities for technical people in various support
services.
D. Project Risks
8.10      The project faces natural, technological, institutional and
marketing risks, these are moderate risks, common to similar projects.
Grenada is subject to natural hazards involving risks created by weather
conditions, pests and diseases. Not much can be done against damage caused
by hurricanes; however, the project would make efforts to avoid other
natural risks by providing for proper on-farm drainage systems and other
conservation measures to prevent soil erosion. The project would also
rebuild the plant protection unit in MOA and provide advisory service to
eliminate pest and disease infestations. The inefficiency of some of the
participating agencies could bring about institutional risks. In order to
reduce this risk the project would provide technical assistance for
institutional strengthening. Changes in the international market situation
for any export crop could present a marketing risk. However, the project
would minimize this risk by diversifying the cropping pattern to include
crops for industrial processing with a strong local market.
IX. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government
of Grenada that:
(a) the Government would exchange views periodically with IDA on its
policies related to the agricultural sector (para. 1.25);
(b) the Government would lease the vehicles to relevant agricultural
extension staff of MOA and MNIB under terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA (para. 3.12);
(c) prior to execution of each study, the project management would
present to IDA a detailed study program including the executor,
scope, terms, and conditions for execution of the study; the
recommendations of the studies (except for the feasibility
studies for the agroindustry) will be carried out in a manner and
in accordance of timetable satisfactory to IDA (para. 3.14);
(d) studies on: (i) the feasibility of rehabilitation needs for the
sugar and rum factory, and (ii) feasibility study of renewal and
upgrading of the machinery and equipment at the coconut oil
factory would be performed during the first project year and
presented to IDA by June 30, 1986, for review (para. 3.15);



- 29 -
(e) a detailed annual training program would be prepared by the
Government not later than November 30 of each year and presented
to IDA (para. 3.18); and
(f) selection of suitable candidates for overseas training and the
designation of institutions for such training, would be done
according to criteria satisfactory to IDA (para. 3.18).
9.02      The following would be conditions of effectiveness:
(a) IDA has been notified by CDB, that all conditions precedent to
the first disbursement of the CDB loan have been fulfilled
(para. 3.09);
(b) the Government would enter into contractual arrangements,
satisfactory to IDA, with the marketing organizations (MNIB and
GBCS) on on-lending IDA credit resources (para. 3.11);
(c) the Government would establish the Project Board of Management
and the PMU (para. 5.04).
9.03      With the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project
would constitute a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of US$5.0 million to
the Government of Grenada and CDB cofinancing of US$1.9 million to the
Grenada Development Bank. The IDA Credit would be on a standard IDA terms.

AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION AND CROP DIVERSIFICATION PROJECT
Climatic Conditions, Land and Water Resources
A. Climatic Conditions
1.        The climate of Grenada is a humid, tropical marine type, with
annual average rainfall ranging between 1,270 mm (50 inches) in the coaetal
lowlands to over 4,200 -m (165 inches) in the highest altitude of the
mountainous interior (see Map IBRD 18410). This rainfall is unevenly
distributed with a comparatively dry season from January to May, followed
by a wet season during the latter half of the year. The maximum mean
temperature is in the range of 28.4C to 30.6"C (83.1@F to 87.1F) and the
minimum 22.9%C to 25.4C (73.2F to 77.7F), depending on month and
altitude. Relative humidity is high all year round, ranging from 80.3% to
83.0Z at 08:00 a.m. and somewhat lower in the afternoon hours--from 74.0%
to 79.3% at 14:00. Annual average daily sunshine ranges from 5.7 to 7.9
hours. Tradewinds prevail throughout the year, blowing in the northwest
direction, right across the highlands. Grenada is located just south of
the tropical storm lines and is rarely affected by hurricanes. However, in
1955, Burricane Janet hit the island, killing as many as 200 persons,
causing serious damage to rural property, ruining banana plantations and
uprooting many commercial fruit trees.
B. Land and Water
2.        Grenada's total area, including Carricou, Petit-Martinique and
other islets is 342 km2 (34,200 ha) of which mainland Grenada accounts for
about 305 kml (30,500 ha). The island is volcanic in origin with a
backbone of mountains running its entire length. Topography is rugged and
the amount of flat land is negligible and that of lesser slope occurs
mainly in the coastal areas, particularly in the northeast and southwest
portions of the island. Only 29% of Grenada's lands have a slope of less
than 20 degrees as follows:
Slope                   Hectares           Percent
less than 5.0 degrees              1,525                5

10.1 - 20.0 degrees             5,800                19
20.1 - 30.0 degrees             14,030               46
more than 30.1 degrees              7,620               25
Total                          30,500               100
Due to the high proportion of steep slopes and the heavy rainfall,
erosion is a threat. However, there is a little evidence of serious
erosion damage on agricultural lands, probably because of the traditional
system of tree crops closely planted in mixed stands and the drainage



- 31 -                      ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 2
systems constructed on many farms. Seven groupings of main soil types were
classified; in general, the soils are well drained and reasonably fertile,
the best being the alluvials and brown earths, which together compose some
26% of total land area.
3.        In 1982, 55% of the total land area was considered agricultural
land, of which 9,920 ha (53% of agricultural land) were under permanent
tree crops, 4,330 ha (23%) were under temporary crops and the rest, 4,574
ha (24Z) were under grassland, forest and woodland and other lands. In the
same year, farms occupied an area of 13,863 ha (74% of the total land used
foragriculture). This represents a decline from 1961, as shown below:

4.        Little is known about the hydrology of the country and its ground
water resources. Surface water flows in rivers and streams of 72
watersheds, with various quantities of water discharge. Some rivers and
streams have the potential of providing supplementary irrigation during the
dry season.

AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION AND CROP DIVERSIFICATION PROJECTS
Trees and Crops - Present Situation
A.  Bananas
1.      The total area planted with bananas is estimated at 1,700 ha,
mostly Musa acuminata (cl.) Robusta variety for export.  The estimated
volume of banana production in 1983 was about 14,000 tons produced by some
2,200 farmers (production figures of bananas as well as for other crops
during the years 1978-1983 are presented in Tables 1 and 2 of this Annex).
In recent years banana production has dropped mainly because of
deteriorating performance at the field level with little application of
fertilizers or pesticides and inefficient post-harvest activities.1/
Average crop yields in 1983 were only about 8.1 tons per ha, of which about
7.5 tons per ha were exportable. In a few irrigated plots, crop yields
reached 22 tons of exportable bananas per ha. The average farm-gate price
for exported bananas in 1983 was ECS 480 (US$177.80) per ton. However,
banana growers could increase their returns by receiving price incentives
for quality of EC$ 70 (US$25.90) per ton for field packed bananas and EC$
10 (US$3.70) per ton of sleeved bananas.
B. Sugarcane
2.      During the la&;t three decades the production of sugarcane and sugar
in Grenada has followed an erratic course. In 1983, sugarcane was reaped
from some 160 ha, and about 4,800 tons of cane were milled for syrup which
was then distilled to rum in the main sugar factory. Crop yields were
rather low, about 302/ tons per ha, mainly because replanting of the old
ratoon was long overdue.  In the last five years very little fertilizer was
applied.
3.      Sugarcane is delivered either to the main sugar 'actory (Grenada
Sugar Factory Ltd. at Woodlands), which was built in 1935 and is jointly
owned by Government and private owners, or to one of the three small
privately owned mills (which in 1983 milled about 2,700 tons). The
factory's machinery, equipment and distillery have long since fully
depreciated in value. Much of the production equipment ', far beyond its
useful life, but the plant is satisfactorily maintained aad in operational
1/ This situation of low performance at field level and reluctance of
farmers to apply inputs and to invest on their farms, applied to
practically all crops during the previous regime. The farmers' fear
that the Government might take control of their farms was the main
reason for that. As a result, crop yields were extremely low.
2/ This figure is according to the official statistics; in practice yields
were higher, as farmers did not want to report the amount of sugarcane
delivered to the small privately-owned mills.



-33                        ANNA- 2
Page 2 of 4
condition. It is somewhat inefficient in production and operates much
below its operational capacity (only 24% of its full production capacity in
1983). No sugar was produced in 1983, only rum, but the plant is rather
flexible ana can convert itself rapidly from rum to sugar production and
vice versa.3/ In 1983, the farmgate price for sugarcane was ECS 66
(US24.40) per ton, which is high by world standards.
C. Coconuts
4.        Presently there are about 1,600 ha of coconut plantations in
Grenada. Most are of pure stand; only a few are mixed with tree crops or
food crops. Trees are not treated properly; as a result, crop yields are
low, about 40 nuts per tree with only some 50 productive trees per ha, or
350 kg of copra per ha. Trees suffer from the Red-Ring and other diseases,
which presently are untreated. Coconuts are either sold as dry coconuts or
dried to copra from which coconut oil is extracted.  The by-product of
coconut meal is suitable for livestock feeding. Oil is extracted either at
the farmer's home in a primitive way or in the privately owned coconut oil
plant, the Tempe Manufacturing Company 'td. The plant is simple but
efficient, and some of its old equipment needs replacement or renovation.
However, the plant is underutilized, processing only 400 tons of copra
annually, while its potential processing capacity could reach 3,500 tons
per year. The average price paid to farmers for copra at the factory gate
in 1983 was EC$ 1.21 (US$0.45) per kg. However, in order to increase
supply, the factory has recently agreed to increase the price paid to
farmers to EC$ 1.32 (US$0.49) per kg.
D. Other Tree and Food Crops
5.        Many crops of different varieties, such as avocados, mangoes,
citrus, sour-sop, paw-paw (papaya), coffee, vegetables and root crops, are
scattered around the island. All fruit trees are planted in mixed stands,
and there are no commercial orchards. For that reason it is difficult to
assess agrotechnical methods and crop yields. However, there is much room
and need for expanding fruit production in terms of volume, variety and
quality. Coffee production also needs expansion. Coffee trees are now
planted only as windbreaks, but trees are nicely developed and producing
relatively high yields of good quality coffee. Commercial coffee
plantations are expected to bring some promising results. Coffee is
processed at a local mill, which also processes raw coffee imported from
Trinidad. Vegetables and root crops are primarily products of backyard
farming and, as in the case of fruits, there is room for commercial
vegetable production which could increase volume, variety and quality of
vegetables supplied to the markets.
3/ It is assumed that 10 tons of sugarcane produce 1 ton of sugar and 350

Grenada Development Bank
1.        The Grenada Development Bank (GDB) is a corporation owned by the
Government of Grenada and is subject to the direct supervision of the
Minister of Planning, Finance and Trade. GBD is the successor (1980) to
the Grenada Agricultural and Industrial Development Corporation (GAIDC),
which, in turn, was the successor (1976) to the Grenada Agricultural Bank
(established in 1965).
Functions and Power
2.        GDB has broad powers to act as a development bank promoting
private and public sector, and individual and corporate investments in
agriculture, industry, tourism and fisheries. It may do so by
participating in share capital, granting loans, mobilizing and coordinating
available resources, and by fostering the development of money and capital
markets in Grenada. To date, GDB has functioned as a channel for
Government and Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) monies via standard short-,
medium- and long-term fixed interest loans to the private and public
sectors. During the period 1972-82, GDB and its predecessor, GAIDC,
received six lines of credit totalling approximately US$2 million for
on-lending for agriculture, industry, tourism and higher education. GDB
has yet to raise funds locally or to take an equity position in any
enterprise. Its most significant role has been as a provider of
longer-term fixed interest loan capital to the private industrial and
agricultural sectors, filling a major gap in the credit system.
Commercial banks with short-term liabilities are increasingly unwilling to
lend long-term, especially to the agricultural sector.
Organizational and Structure
3.        The GDB organizational structure is presented in Chart 2.  The
Minister of Finance exercises control over, inter alia: appointing the
manager and the Board of Directors, and making regulations related to
borrowing and on-lending for GDB. GDB's affairs are guided by an 11-member
Board of Directors who represent broad sectoral interests and meet
regularly on policy, administrative and financial issues. The
responsibility for implementation of board policy and for day-to-day
management rests with the manager. The manager, in turn, is supported by
three management positions: (a) a senior agricultural credit officer
(until recently the position filled by a CDB-funded specialist under a CDB
program to strengthen GDB); (b) a senior industrial credit specialist
(GDB-funded); and (c) a senior loan administration officer. Special
attention is given to the Agricultural Credit Department. The farm
improvement officer heads the Agricultural Credit Department, which, with
support from agricultural credit officers, prepares annual budgets and

Page 2 of 8
targets for lending, disbursements and collections, and identifies,
appraises and supervises agricultural loans and sub-projects. Staffing in
the Agricultural Credit Department appears adequate for current and future
lending under the proposed project. In general, GDB appears to be
well-prepared for expansion of its loan portfolio.
Financial Performance
4.        Tables 1-6 of this Annex present financial statements of GDB.
Since 1979, GDB's financial performance has shown significant improvement.
Annual subvention requirements reduced from 65.5% (1979) to 28.5Z of
expenditure (1982). Average revenue on outstanding subloans increased from
4.5% to 6.9% and assets increased from EC$ 2.1 million (US$0.8 million) in
1979 to EC$ 4.1 million (US$1.5 million) in 1982 and to EC$ 7.3 million
(US$2.7 million) in 1983. The long-term debt to equity ratio increased
from 1.3:1 in 1979 to 2.5:1 in 1982, which is a satisfactory change. In
order to build its equity, GDB was subsidized from 1979 to 1982 by the
Government of Grenada--ECS 556,000 (US$205,000)-and by CDB's technical
assistance program-EC$ 72,000 (US$27,000). However, annual subsidies have
been declining over the past year, and GDB is expected to become viable in
the near future.
5.        The problems of collection have been real, and GDB and CDB are
aware of them. However, while the loan portfolios hve increased slowly
but steadily, GDB has taken active measures to reduce the arrears
situation. As a result, arrears over 12 months, dropped from 13.3% of
principle outstanding in December 1981, to 5.0% in June 1983.

Marketing and National Import Board
Functions
1.        The Marketing and National Import Board (MNIB) is a statutory
body established by the Government of Grenada, Act no. 40 of 1973, as
amended by the People's Law no. 69 of 1979. According to that law, the
main responsibility of MNIB is to market the produce of Grenada that is not
already marketed under another statutory authority; to establish and
operate mills and other plants for preparing and processing produce; to
establish and operate cold and any other storage, to regulate grading and
establish prices of produce, and act as commission agents for produce; to
trade and deal in foodstuffs for livestock, seeds and fertilizers; and to
handle packaging materials. MNIB was declared the sole importer of any
foodstuff and building material. However, in practice, MNIB performed much
less. It marketed fruits, vegetables and rootcrops, mainly in the local
market, but covering only about 10-15% of the share of that market. MNtB
became the sole importer of cement, rice, sugar and fertilizer (with the
exception of fertilizers imported and sold to banana growers by GBCS).
Organizational Structure
2.        MNIB is controlled by a board of nine directors appointed by the
Minister of Finance, Trade and Planning. The Board of Directors appoints a
General Manager, who reports to the Board, and a Deputy General Manager.
The organizational structure is simple, consisting of six divisions, each
headed by a manager who reports directly to the General Manager or his
deputy. The six divisions are: (a) Administration Division, which is
responsible for personnel, administrative services, property, and inland
transport; (b) Finance Division, which is responsible for all the financial
accounting and control of MNIB; (c) Import Division, which is responsible
for all sorts of imports and storage of the merchandise in warehouses;
(d) Shipping Division, which is responsible for organizing shipping for
exports or imports and for operating MNIB's own small cargo ship;
(e) Marketing Division, which is responsible for the export marketing of
fresh and processed products and the domestic sale of processed products;
and (f) Purchasing Division, which is responsible for buying local products
from producers and selling them in the MNIB retail outlets, as well as
handling retail of all imported products.
3.        MNIB buys produce directly from the farmers at the Board's
warehouse. The fruit and vegetables for the domestic market are sold in
the retail store owned and operated by the Board. Export produce, such as
eggplants, mangoes, yams (which have been exported in small quantities over
the past years), is graded and packed before export. However, the MNIB
does not yet have proper grading and packing facilities. A system of



-45 -                       ANNEX 4
Page 2 of 2
contract purchasing from farmers is in force between MNIB and farmers.
Some 800 farmers in 1983 have signed these minimum guarantee price
contracts with the Board.
MNIB Reorganization
4.        The Interim Government decided that in the absence of other
agencies dealing with wholesale marketing of farm produce, MNIB would
remain the central agency to carry out the task. However, MNIB is capable
of carrying out the task only if it reorganizes itself; the reorganization
has started with assistance from an expatriate consultant, financed by the
Overseas Development Administration (ODA). Additional institutional
strengthening would be provided by the project to make MNIB a more
competent and viable organization.
5.        The main features of the reorganization of the agricultural
sections should include:
(a) The two divisions that deal with marketing of agricultural
produce (Marketing and Purchasing Divisions) would merge into a
single division with three operative units: (i) produce
procurement unit; (ii) internal marketing unit; and (iii) export
marketing unit.
(b) A strong emphasis would be placed on the produce procurement
unit, which would, with assistance from the extension service,
introduce farmers to advanced post-harvesting methods (handling,
sorting, grading, packing and transporting), and be in charge of
t'ie necessary physical facilities.
(c) Unlike the past, when the Government requested MNIB to deal with
numerous unviable operations, MNIB would deal only with viable
activities and restructure its financial situation.

AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION AND CROP DIVERSIFICATION PROJECT
Grenada Banana Cooperative Society
1.        The Grenada Banana Cooperative Society (GBCS) was set up by the
Banana Ordinance of March 1955. GBCS has the authority to rehabilitate
banana plantations, stimulate production and control the disposal of sill
bananas produced for export. Membership in the Society is open to all
banana growers, and the Society is responsible for maintaining an annually
updated register of members. The Society is given power to fix growers'
prices, impose a levy or cess on the prices, and regulate the grading and
selection of bananas.
2.        In practice, GBCS carries out the following activities: it
purchases bananas from the farmers, performs the necessary post harvest
activities and exports the bananas through Geest Industries, Ltd. (a large
British shipping company with marketing department which is responsible for
marketing East Caribbean Island bananas to the U.K.).   GBCS is a member of
WINBAN, an organization for banana growers in Dominica, St. Lucia, St.
Vincent and Grenada, with the objectives of promoting and fostering
marketing of bananas from the Windward Islands and of buying and selling
all input needs of the industry, including fertilizers, spraying materials
and small implements. GBCS has its own extension service and is providing
pest and disease control spraying.
Organizational Structure
3.        GBCS is controlled by ten individuals appointed by the
Government, some of whom are banana growers. The organizational structure
is simple and adequate to carry out its tasks. There is a general manager
who reports directly to the Board of Directors and controls four
departments: (a) accounting; (b) development (extension and leaf spot
control); (c) operations (boxing plants); and (d) quality control. During
the last six years, sales of fruit declined steadily. As a result,
deficits were incurred (with the exception of 1982), and growers' profits
were reduced. Other factors responsible for the deficit were the high cost
of packing materials, pest and disease control, and the inefficiency of
most post harvest activities (inland transport and packing).
4.        The Interim Government decided to continue the activities of GBCS
as the marketing agency for bananas and encouraged GBSC to take measures to
reduce cost and improve efficiency. GBCS management has already initiated
steps in that direction. The project would also assist in improving the
efficiency, thus reducing costs.

AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION AND CROP DIVERSIFICATION PROJECT
Trees and Crops Under the Project
A. Bananas
1.        The low crop yields of about 7.5 tons per ha and the present low
level of cultivation practice (with practically no fertilizations) of most
ucirrigated banana plantations, necessitate a rehabilitation program.
Although there are only few pure stand bananas on the island,
rehabilitation and introduction of improved practices are expected to bring
promising results. The project would provide credit to farmers to
rehabilitate 400 ha, of which 300 ha are rainfed and 100 ha are under
supplementary irrigation. Rehabilitat! n activities would include:
treatment of suckers; replanting (proper spacing, suitable varieties and
certified planting material); weed control; proper fertilizer applications;
installation of supplementary irrigation system (where applicable);
drainage; plant protection; fruit care; and proper harvesting and
handling. Under the rehabilitation program, with proper maintenance,
yields after 10 to 14 months are expected to be some 17 tons of exportable
bananas per ha on the rainfed plots and 29 tons per ha on the irrigated
plots. These projections are based on achievements of similar banana
rehabilitation programs on neighboring islands. The required investment is
estimated at EC$ 5,200 (US$1,930) per ha of rainfed bananas and EC$ 13,100
(US$4,850) per ha of irrigated bananas. The investments (for bananas, as
well as for other crops) include allocation for drainage and other
conservation works to avoid soil erosion.
B. Sugarcane
2.        The scanty supply of sugarcane, tee importation of sugar into the
country and the low producing ratoons call for an improvement in sugarcane
production. Replanting of old ratoons, which is long overdue, and planting
of previously abandoned sugarcane lands would be the major steps in the
program to increase quantity and productivity in sugarcane production. The
project would provide credit for replanting of some 160 ha (practically the
entire cane area of 1983) and new planting on about 120 ha. The activity
involves: disking of old ratoons or abandoned cane land, plowing, two to
three harrowings, furrowing, fertilizing, and planting. The first cut is
expected to begin 12 months after planting, and under a production cycle of
one planted cane and four ratoons, an annual average crop can reach about
65 tons per ha. This projection is based on the average crop yields of two
Caribbean islands: Jamaica (low yields) and Barbados (high yields). The
achievement in these islands was reached without any specific project
support. Therefore, it is expected, that with all the project efforts the
above yields would be reached. The required investment is estimated at
EC$ 2,300 (US$850) per ha.

Page 2 of 3
C. Coconuts
3.        Costly imports of coconut oil to Grenada and the underutilization
of processing facilities encourage rehabilitation and expansion of coconut
trees for copra production. The project would provide credit for
rehabilitation of about 260 ha and new planting of 140 ha. Selected
seedlings of the Malayan Dwarf variety would be imported during the
project's first year and then be supplied from the MOA Plant Propagation
Unit. In the rehabilitated plots, seedlings would be interplanted to fill
in the gaps with up to about 200 new trees per ha (in pure stand plots) and
in new plots (only pure stand is recommended) up to 250 trees of the
Malayan Dwarf variety would be planted per ha. Fertilizer and herbicides
would be applied in circles around the trees, and specific measures against
plant disease would be taken. Trees are expected to start yielding in the
sixth year and reach full production of about 50 nuts per tree or 10,000
nuts (about 1,360 kg of copra equivalent)l/ per ha after ten years in the
rehabilitated plots. New plots are expected to yield at full production
about 85 nuts per tree or 21,250 nuts (about 2,890 kg of copra equivalent)
per ha. These projections are based on results of a study on coconuts in
the Eastern Caribbean Islands performed by an FAO expert for Caribbean
Community (CARICOM) Secretariat. The estimated required investments are
ECS 2,622 (US$970) per ha of rehabilitated plots and ECS 4,368 (US$1,620)
per ha of new planting.
D. Coffee
4.        Grenada imports raw coffee from Trinidad and Tobago and
processes it in existing facilities. The existence of processing
facilities together with suitable ecological conditions existence of
processing facilities together with suitable ecological conditions create a
good opportunity for coffee growing. Credit would be provided for new
coffee plantings (preferably of pure stand) of about 16 ha. The coffee
seedlings would be planted either individually, by groups, or by
hedge-rows, with about 2,000 plants per ha. Plants would be set in mounds
of mixed soil and manure or other organic matter.  The seedlings would be
progeny of selected high yielding trees, of Coffee C.a or C.r robusta
species (according to elevation) and would be supplied by the MOA Plant
Propagation Unit. Production would start during the fifth year and remain
steady thereafter, reaching a high yield of about 0.45 kg of green coffee
per tree, or about 900 kg per ha. The required investment is estimated at
EC$ 13,200 (US$4,890) per ha.
E. Tropical Fruit Trees
5.        The project would provide credit for development of commercial
tropical fruit plantations on about 144 ha, assuming about 48 ha of
avocados, 48 ha of mangoes and 48 ha of miscellaneous tropical fruits.2/
1/ One nut equals about 0.136 kg of copra equivalent.
2/ Including: soursop, guava, tamarind, golden apple, sugar apple, paw
paw (papaya) and others.



-49 -                     ANNEX 6
Page 3 of 3
The plantation would be of pure stand of improved varieties for the export
market. Avocado and miscellaneous fruit trees would start three years
after planting, reaching full commercial production on the fifth year.
Mango trees would start bearing fruit four years after planting,  reaching
a full production on the sixth year. The expected crop yields are:
avocados            - 4,000 kg/ha
mangoes             - 3,500 kg/ha
miscellaneous fruit - 4,500 kg/ha
Investments estimated at EC$ 7,200 (US$2,670) per ha, concentrated in the
first year, since fooderops intercropping, are recommended in the first few
years. The investments are expected to provide farmers with an additional
income until the trees start bearing fruit.
F. Vegetables
6.        The project would provide credit for establishing about 10 ha for
commercial vegetable production, consisting of sweet and hot peppers,
eggplant, onions, watermelons, cucumbers, etc. The produce would be sorted
and packed for export to foreign markets. Expected crop yields are as
follows:
hot peppers -  5,000 kg/ha           sweet peppers -  8,000 kg/ha
eggplant    - 10,000 kg/ha           onions        - 10,000 kg/ha
The average investment in equipment and infrastructure is estimated at
EC$ 8,000 (US$2,960) per ha.
G. Ornamental Plants and Cut Flowers
7.        The project would provide credit to ornamental plant and cut
flower growers who would like to enter this new line of production intended
mainly for export. Development would cover a variety of outdoor plants and
cut flowers according to market requirements (calculations made for this
project considered the Dracena foilage plants as a typical example with
expected yields of about 140,000 flower tips per ha). Average investment
in equipment and planting material is estimated as EC$ 120,000 (US$44,400)
per ha. This investment seems to be very high; however, the return from
this activity is expected to be very high, and an average farm can earn
reasonable living from an area of 1/5 ha of ornamental plants and cut
flowers.

AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION AND CROP DIVERSIFICATION PROJECTS
FEEDER ROAD MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION COMPONENT
Institution-Strengthening Program
A. Program for Maintenance Management System
Existing Organization
1.        The Ministry of Communications, Works, Civil Aviation, Energy and
Public Utilities (MOCW) is responsible for the maintenance of the road
system in Grenada. The maintenance department is organized into eight
districts run by engineeringassistants and staffed with a road officer, 8
to 10 road foremen and 200 to300 laborers per district.
2.        Management is very thin and needs technical assistance and
training in maintenance methods and procedures, planning and productivity
standards. MOCW needs technical assistance and government support to
become effective in road maintenance.
Objectives
3.        The objectives of an Maintenance Management System (MKS) are to
increase productivity, establish uniform ways of performing work and
improve the quality of road maintenance. These objectives are accomplished
by planning, directing, controlling and monitoring work.
Scope
4.        Several MMS elements are considered basic to the effective job of
managing maintenance. The MMS designed and implemented for MOCW must, as a
minimum, include the above elements. These key elements include:
(a) road inventory
(b) activity definitions and accomplishment units
(c) work program
(d) maintenance performance standards
(e) scheduling
(f) reporting systems
(g) evaluation and control
(h) performance budget
Personnel
5.        A special unit within the MOCW maintenance department would be
needed to implement the MKS. This unit needs the following personnel:



_53 -                      ANNEX 8
Page 2 of 2
(a) Senior Technician
(b) System Analysts (2)
(c) Data processing support personnel (optional)
Technical Assistance/Training
6.        A consultant would assist the MMS engineer in the development of
the system, his service would be needed for about 9 months. The US
Department of Transportation might assist in implementing an MMS, which has
already been developed and in operation in some developing countries,
provided the Government of Grenada so requests.
B. Program for Establishing a Materials and Soils Laboratory
Existing Organization
7.        MOCW has established a small labortory as part of the Eastern
Main Road Construction Project. The capacity of this facility is severely
limited due to lack of funds, personnel and equipment.
8.        An engineer is in charge of the lab, but new facilities and
additional equipment are necesary to improve the capacity of the lab to
handle testing and quality control of materials necessary for the
maintenance programs
Objective
9.        Provide a testing facility that would establish standards and
certify the quality of the materials used for maintenance, rehabilitation
aLd construction.
Scope
10.       Equip a soils and materials testing latoratory, establish test
standards and criteria, train staff, provide authority and procedures for
the lab to reject materials that do not meet the MOCW standards and design
criteria, and provide a field testing service for MOCW construction
inspectors.
Personnel
11.       The laboratory would be run by an engineer and staffed by
laboratory technicians.
Technical Assistance/Training
12.       A soil engineer consultant would be used to assist the engineer
in the equipping, operation and development of standards for the
laboratory, his service is estimated at 3 months. The engineer and lab
technicians should receive training in performing and analyzing the tests.

I/  The phasing is almost evenly spread over the project's five years

farms, and there is no need to gradually build up their activity. Once
they get the resources, they can start with the rehabilitation program.
