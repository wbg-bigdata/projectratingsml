FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT

PREFACE & PREAMBLE
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fourth Highway
Project in Argentina, for which Loan 1384-AR in the amount of US$105.0
million was approved cn March 22, 1977. The loan was closed on December
31, 1985, four years behind schedule. US$0.3 million was cancelled during
the course of the project. The last disbursement was on February 20, 1987,
fourteen months after loan closing, due to the delay in documenting
disbursement adjustments to historic exchange rates.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy Operations
Division of the Latin America and the Caribbean Office (Preface & Preamble,
Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III). On September 15, 1989, the Bank sent
the Borrower Parts I and III with the request to prepare Part II by
November 3, 1989, but no reply was received.
The preparation of this PCR was started two years after completion
of the project in January 1989. The PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff
Appraisal Report; the Loan Agreement; supervision reports; a civil works
suz-ary report prepared for the Borrower by the coordinating consultant for
project civil works; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower;
internsl Bank memoranda; and additional data obtained from the Borrower by
the Bank highway mission in March/April 1989.
Preamble
The project became effective December 13, 1977 and the final
disbursement was made February 20, 1987. During this time, Argentina went
through periods of very high inflation. The renomination of the currency
at various dates shown below indicate the order of magnitude of the
problem.
January 1, 1970                 1 $ley = 100 $mn
June 1, 1983                    1 $a   - 10,000 $ley
June 14, 1985                   1 A    = 1,000 $a
The exchange rate for the same dates show:
January 1, 1970                 1 $ley = US$ 0.26
June 1, 1983                    1 $a   = US$ 0.12
June 14, 1985                   1 A    = US$ 1.35
The difficulty both for the contractors and for Vialidad (the
National Highway Department) of executing a road improvement program in the
turbulent and unsteady macro-economic climate, with the associated



- ii - 
budgeting complexities, is evident throughout the project. While the full
impact on the project cannot be measured precisely, the project files
document that the inflation caused several contractors to fail. It is also
significant to bear in mind that the Bank's former policy of disbursing at
the exchange rate of the day-of-disbursement as opposed to the rate on
which payment had actually been made by Vialidad, consistently reduced the
Bank's contribution to civil works in real terms and aggravated Vialldad's
problems in funding the works in a timely fashion throughout most of the
project.  Although recommended by Bank supervision mi-sions in 1983, not
until 1986 was any adjustment for underpayment of the Bank's nominal
percentage contribution actually made. In 1986 and 1987 the Bank
reimbursed over US$17.0 million to compensate for accumulated under-
contribution to project costs. The project's role in promoting
disbursement policy change within the Bank to that of using the rate of
exchange on the date on which payment was made by the executing agency, was
truly significant.
Finally, throughout this report, the US$ equivalent costs of civil
works have been calculated by converting the value of work performed (or
billed) during any month by the exchange rate of the last day of such
month. This ignores numerous distortions introduced by the normal delays
in actually effecting payments to contractors, late payments by Vialidad or
delayed settlement of claims. In aggregate, however, it is felt to result
in representative cost figures upon which economic re-evaluation can
reasonably be based.

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(LOAN 1503-AR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
Project objectives were: (a) improving 1,285 km of earth or gravel
(925 km) and already paved (360 km) roads, mostly serving agricultural
export traffic, and/or international connections, to adequate paved
standards (para. 1.3); (b) improving national transport planning by
establishing a National Directorate for Sectorial Planning (DNTP) and
training staff during its preparation of a National Transport plan (NTP);
and (c) conducting studies in three priority areas, namelyt (i) Regional
Agricultural Development, (ii) Pavement Overlay need determination, and
(iii) Traffic Safety (para. 1.4).
Dur4ng the project, substitvtion of a few project roads added
about 240 km of road length, also added were flood damage repairs (mostly
to bridges) while thd Agricultural study was deleted (para. 1.5).
Implementation Experience
The start of project roadworks was delayed almost two years due to
all of Vialidad's budget being needed for ongoing road works (para. 1.9)
and final project completion was delayed five years. Completion dates and
costs of many civil works sub-projects were delayed and changed by numerous
design changes during construction, unusually heavy rains and frequent
changes from railroad to road transport of aggregates over long distances.
Inflation also played an important role leading to time consuming,
negotiated unit-price increases and some contractor failures resulting in
drawn out litigation and retendering (para. 1.10).
Implementation of the institutional components, except the
Agricultural study, was successful despite delayed contracting of technical
assistance (paras. 1.12 and 1.13). Preparation of the NTP was heavily
supported by the Bank, who provided qualified staff and devoted
considerable supervision mission backup to DNTP (para. 1.23).
The civil works and consultant studies, once started, were by and
large well managed by Vialidad (para. 1.25). Preparation of the NTP
suffered some set-backs due to organization weaknesses (para. 1.8) and
difficulty in coordinating the six consulting contracts involved (para.
1.28).
The Bank was sometimes slow in responding to assist with critical
implementation problems due to difficulties in adapting its procedures to
respond to unstable macro-economic country conditions (para. 1.22), in
particular, Bank disbursements for civil works were about 202 below the
Loan's nominal percentage during most of the project, increasing local fund



- iv -
requirements (para. 1.18). This was due to the effect of local inflation
on the exchange rate used by the Bank at the time disbursements were made,
generally several months after the Government effected actual payments to
contractors. Not until late in the project did the Bank agree to
*adjustment" for disbursements, calculated from "Historic Exchange* rates
(para. 1.22).
Results
The project's specific physical goals were actually exceeded at an
acceptable cost (para. 1.11). An economic reevaluation of most of the
civil w.rks (over 80Z of project cost) gave a weighted project ERR of 22Z
(versus 23Z at appraisal) with sub-project ERRs of 6.2Z to 62.3Z (only one
lower than the 1OZ opportunity cost of capital at appraisal)(para. 1.16).
Traffic growth rates in the project area, however, were
substantially lower than estimated at appraisal, reflecting less economic
growth than had been anticipated (para. 1.15).
The NTP was a significant success in improving planning and policy
formulation. The DNTP was abie to provide technical back-up on major
transport investment issues. Most important was the training (including
some by EDI) of many transport professionals (para. 1.12). Both the
Traffic Safety Study and Pavement Overlay Study were satisfactorily
completed and the latter was expanded to develop a total Road-Needs
determination methodology (para. 1.13).
Sustainability
As long as maintenance funding and management remain satisfactory,
the useful life and economic benefits of road improvements should be fully
realized. Improvements in road needs planning, maintenance management,
traffic counting and economic evaluation have been institutionalized within
Vialidad, but current macro-economic instability with austerity driven
budget restrictions pose some threat to maintaining Vialidad's
organizational, technical and management quality (para. 1.19). Political
changes have led to the disappearance of DNTP, its functions subsumed under
other modal offices, however, some of the models it developed are still
being used and upgraded and the country has a trained cadre of transport
specialists to draw on (para. 1.20).
Findings and Lessons
The lessons which could be drawn from the project appear already
largely incorporated in the subsequent Bank financed project and reflected
in Vialidad's performance thereunder. These include improved quality of
detailed engineering and updating of old plans; review of Vialidad's total
commitments during programming and budgeting; greater flexibility in
substituting for works which run into physical or administrative delays
(program approach)(para. 1.22); and the establishment of special accounts
in Bank loans with provision for disbursements calculated at conversion
rates of the date of payment.

B.       Background
1.2      The policies which had been pursued over the 1973-1975 period had
left Argentina's transport sector in a state of disarray. Ineffective
sector management, overstaffing, inadequate maintenance, and excessive
subsidization were among the legacies that a new Government had to try to
resolve. In addition, Argentina had been slow in developing effective
institutions and policies for transport planning and coordination. The new
Government, which had come to power in March 1976, had been primarily
occupied with immediate macro-economic problems but had, however, indicated
a number of policies which had direct implications for the transport
sectort (a) restricting public investment to high priority projects; (b)
restoring the financial integrity of state-owned agencies; (c) developing
exports; and (d) opening up new areas for agricultural development. At the
time of appraisal, the Government and the Bank agreed on a follow-on
highway project for the sector to improve transport export services and
access to areas with agricultural export potential. The Government also
placed high priority on creating international road connections with
Brazil, Bolivia and Chile and on diverting traffic from Buenos Aires. The
core of the project was to be a road betterment program which had
previously been identified and prepared during the Second Highway Project
and updated under the Third, then updated several times, but delayed thtee
times before the final appraisal in 1976. The delays reflected the Bank's
concern over macro-economic issues, particularly the country's fiscal
situation which, with inadequate pricing of public services and poorly



- 2 -
conceived investment programs, the Bank felt could lead to serious
inflation. In 1976 the Bank felt the new Government would follow adequate
macro-economic policies and agreed to additional lending.
C.       Prolect Obiectives and DescriPtion
1.3      The Road Betterment Program (total length 1,285 km - Table 1), had
as its main objective improving existing roads linking agriculture areas
with ports. It consisted of: (i) paving and improving 14 earth or gravel
road sections totaling about 925 km; (ii) repaving and improving four
sections of paved highways totalling about 324 km; and (iii) upgrading two
highway sections (about 36 km) from two-lane to four-lane.
1.4      The Bank, also concerned with the institutional aspects of
transport planning and policy in Argentina, provided funds in both the
First and Second Highway Projects for improving the administrative,
planning and design capabilities of Vialidad and local consultants. The
Third Highway Project contained a covenant requiring adequate staffing of
the Sectoral Planning Office in the Secretariat for Transport and Public
Works, but no action was taken by the Government during 1973 through 1976.
The Bank's persistence led the new Government, in 1976, to establish the
National Directorate for Sectoral Planning to improve national transport
planning, and the project provided funds for a National Transport Plan. It
also provided funds for a Regional Agricultural Development Study; a
Pavement Overlay Study; and a Traffic Safety Program.
1.5      The Loan Agreement was revised and amended ten times (Table 4).
Of these chenges, two affected the project description. That of June 29,
1981 deleted three road sections with a total length of 138 km and added
380 km of roadworks while that of August 29, 1983 added emergency (flood
damaged) bridge works and an unspecified length of associated road repairs.
The former of the amendments also deleted the Regional Agricultural
Development Study, the only significant change in project objectives.
D.       Project Design and Organization
1.6      Only 355 km of the 1,285 km originally identified in 1972 were
carried over to the project finally appraised in 1976, due to the Bank's
insistence that all the roads be export-orieuted. The concept was
supported by the Government, but Vialidad may have wished to include more
of tae road sections from the original list for which designs had already
beer. prepared. The rapid preparation of additional road designs coupled
with the use of old' detailed engineering, without adequate updating for
changes which had occurred during the elapsed interval, resulted in design
inadequacies which affected project execution and cost. Vialidad also
tended to push for higher geometrical and pavement design standards than
the Bank considered justifiable. This led to an unusually specific
definition of roads and standards being included in the Loan Agreement,
which eventually complicated Loan administration (pars. 1.30). The scope
and scale of the project was appropriate in light of its objectives, but
its timing ignored the large backlog of ongoing works contracted before
1976 (including some US$30.0 million unused loan funds from the Second and
Third Highway Loans). In view of the ensuing delay, the project appraisal
could have been delayed by at least one year.



1.7      The roles and responsibilities of the agencies were clearly
defined. Both the Pavement Overlay Study, intended to review the pavement
maintenance and rehabilitation needs o' the expanding paved network, and a
Traffic Safety program, intended to focus on solutions to the problems
causing an inordinate number of traffic deaths, were executed under
Vialidad supervision, who understood and agreed with the need for and
underlying concepts of the studies. The Regional Agricultural Development
Study, however, which was placed under the National Directorate of Regional
Economy, was of questionable design and the Bank's concept was not shared
throughout the Government. It was eventually deleted from the project.
1.8      The National Transport Plan (NTP) was executed by the newly
established National Directorate of Sectoral Planning [later, the National
Directorate for Transport Planning (DNTP)l under the Under-Secretariat of
Transport, supported by foreign consultants. It relied heavily on training
local staff and local consultants to produce a practical transport policy
document with related programs which was the most innovative feature of the
project. It was a major undertaking whose size was warranted considering
the major infrastructure investments and disinvestments being contemplated
in ports and railways. The concept of the NTP had significant strengths:
(i) it was a locally generated idea supported by earmarked local funds and
staffed with a good cadre of young, talented professionals who were highly
motivated; (ii) the development of the plan was expected to be a major
contributor to training and data gathering rather than simply the
preparation of a "planu; and (iii) the plan was to be policy oriented and
not simply a physical investment document. The organization adopted for
the work, however, had significant weaknesses: (i) the contractual make-up
for the plan (six separate study contracts) was difficult to coordinate and
resulted in conflicts, delays and excess costs; (ii) the simultaneous start
of all contracts, in particular that of the modelling contract, was
inappropriate (by the time the issues were identified and the data
collected, the funds had been spent); and (iii) the comprehensive transport
modelling was at the limit of the state of the art, too complex and
virtually impossible to achieve.
E.       Project Implementation
Road Betterment Program
1.9      The start of the project civil works was delayed almost two years
beyond the appraisal estimate as the Vialidad budget, although sizeable =n
the context of the Government's policy of restraining public expenditures,
was insufficient to permit it to start the Road Betterment program until
the needs of its ongoing works program were met. If it had obtained an
increase of its total funding, there is a serious question whether or not
the local contracting industry could have absorbed the added work.
Tendering (scheduled for the second quarter of 1977) did not begin until
June 1978 and continued through 1979. The first contract (scheduled for
the third quarter of 1977) was signed in June 1979.
1.10     Numerous design changes during construction and adverse weather
conditions played significant roles in changing sub-project costs and in
delaying completion of the Roads Betterment Program (Table 2). In addition
to numerous pavement design changes, inadequate information regarding
quarries and ground water levels, major changes in volumes of earthworks,
and substantial additions to culverts and drainage measures (in some cases



- 4 -
due to actual experience on the job sites during the heavy rains) all
contributed to delays and sometimes to rescission of contracts due to work-
volume changes. The inability of the railroad to transport ard deliver
aggregates, which had then to be moved by road over long distances,
frequently contributed to increased costs. During the February to October
1982 period, more delay resulted when Vialidad ordered the contractors to
reduce the pace of works, owing to the budgetary limits imposed on it by
the Government. Inflation also played an important role; it not only
caused time-consuming, negotiated increases in unit prices, but also some
of the works were stopped because the contractors went broke (sometimes due
to serious underbidding, but in other cases due to the d.fference in parity
between the peso and the dollar which affected contractors who had bought
foreign equipment and could not meet their foreign payment obligations).
These contract failures led to litigation and delayed retendering until the
cases had been settled. The final payment for works by the Bank was in
February 1987, some five years later than estimated.
1.11     The total Road Betterment Cost (civil works including
contingencies) at appraisal was estimated at US$319.3 million.1   The final
cost of all the civil works in which the Bank participated came to US$368.6
million, as shown in Table 1 and summarized below:

Although per kilometer costs, including contingencies, generally remained
about the same, the variation on some projects proved quite large. In
general, contract bids tended to average only about 502-55Z of final cost.
National Transport Plan (NTP)
1.12     The NTP was a very significant success in terms of planning and
policy formulation although some of its conceptual problems were only
resolved late in the project by focussing on a limited number of
1/    Includes, pro-rata, US$71.2 million of the total US$77.0 million in
contingencies.

commodities and specific passenger corridors. In common with many planning
agencies, the DNTP suffered from some resentment and lack of cooperation of
the modal agencies. Moreover, the NTP was prepared in a period of frequent
changes in the military regime so that the Directorate was often facing
political challenges to its existence. The Bank had to intervene after
each palitical change to explain the rationale for the DNTP which had,
nonetheless, to keep responding to changing political ideologies. The NTP
was, however, able to provide technical back-up to officials in order to
fight major political battles over transport investment, especially in
ports and railways. Most important was the training of many professionals
(including 20 whose training was prepared and supervised by EDI).
Vialidad Institutional Studies
1.13     A contract was negotiated by Vialidad with a consortium of three
Argentine firms for a nine month traffic safety study. Bank supervision
missions encouraged attention to specific goals which would be cost
effective without depending too much on changes in legislature and/or
customs or habits. A draft final report was presented in March 1980. The
PavemeLt Overlay Study started almost a year behind schedule (September
1978). With Bank agreement, Vialidad increased the scope of the
consultants' work to preparing and applying a total needs study methodology
for the entire national network. The stud, was satisfactor4lly completed in
1984.
F.       Project Results and Impact
1.14     In physical terms, the project's specific goals of road betterment
was actually exceeded (para. 1.11) at an acceptable cost, in micro-economic
terms. However, traffic figures in the project area (para. 1.15) were
substantially below those estimated at appraisal. In institutional terms,
the National Transport Plan met its reporting and training objectives and
has had a positive impact on the sector growth and policies by providing a
cadre of trained transport planners and economists. It also provided a
substantial data base and computer models from which to analyze both new
projects and national policy. The methodology developed during the Road
Needs Study was used in the preparation of the Fifth Highway Sector Project
and led to the development of a rGad information system which was
subsequently established in the Maintenance Department within Vialidad.
From the Traffic Safety study, the collection of traffic accident
statistics (including causes), is still in the course of being implemented
and expanded by DN7 with provincial cooperation.
1.15     Traffic growth rates, from which benefit growth was estimated, was
projected at appraisal to average about 6.OZ (ranging from 3.0Z to 9.OZ)
for the twenty sections analysed. For comparison, country-wide 1965-1986
traffic growth (in tons and passenger kilometers) taken from NTP reports is

For the reevaluated project sections, traffic volumes were obtained from
Vialidad's annual traffic surveys. The calculated annual average traffic
growth rates (Table 3) range from a low of -5.02 to a high of ll.OZ with
the average rate of growth for all project sections at about 0.5Z,
substantially lower than the appraisal estimate, but consistent with the
1975-86 values indicated above. In retrospect, the growth rate assumed at
appraisal were too optimistic, even considering the results registered in
1965-1975. The traffic figures also suggest that the project's impact on
agricultural growth may be debatable. However, the sustained exports of
agricultural products and the growing role of private ports in the export
trade have certainly been supported by the project and other investments in
the road sub-sector.
Economic Returns
1.16     The economic reevaluation of the Road Betterment Program which, as
at appraisal, represents 972 of the project cost gave a weighted project
ERR of 222, slightly lower than that the 232 at appraisal (see Table 3).
The individual ERRs ranged from 6.22 to 62.32 with all the sections
analyzed, except the Vera-Tostado section, having an ERR higher than 10l
(the estimated opportunity cost of capital for Argentina at appraisal).
The analysis considered the economic cost of construction, periodic
maintenance seals or overlays and the annual maintenance required during
the 20-year economic life of road sections. Due to lack of data ons (i)
traffic for roads which were transferred to the provinces and (ii) costs of
diversions from the bridges, only 832 of the total cost of the Program was
reevaluated. Tne benefits calculated in the reevaluation are more
conservative than those estimated at appraisal in that only savings in
vehicle operating costs and time have been considered. Savings in road
maintenance costs or due to reduced road lengths resulting from the road
improvements have not been considered. During the economic reevaluation it
was established that taxes on construction contracts amounted to about 332
of total costs, whereas at appraisal these were estimated at 452 of
contract cost, which might imply that contract prices could have been
expected to drop about 102 had all else remained unchanged.
1.17     A major outcome of the reinforcement of the planning capabilities
of Vialidad was a comprehensive and reliable data bank for evaluating
vehicle operating costs under a wide range of conditions. This is a major
improvement over the information used at appraisal and may in part explain
why the overall reevaluated ERR is practically the same as at appraisal,
even with traffic growths lower than expected.

1.18     The project was less successful in realizing timely resource
transfers. Not only was less than 4OZ of the loan disbursed at the time of
the original Loan Closing Date, but the Bank's contributions to ongoing
roadworks sub-projects were of the order of 202 lower than the Bank's
nominal percentage participation, during most of the course of the project,
increasing the local fund requirement and complicating the timely payment
of contractors.
G.       Project Sustainability
1.19     The macro-economic and political stability which Argentina is able
to achieve will determine the extent to which the full potential benefits
of the project are maintained. As long as timely financing for road
maintenance is available and good road maintenance management continues,
the level of net benefits throughout the economic life of the road
improvements would remain acceptable. Improvements in road needs planning,
maintenance management, traffic counting, economic evaluation have been
institutionalized within Vialidad. Further modernization is being sought.
However, with the current macro-economic instability, effective need-based
planning, budgeting and work execution has become virtually impossible;
moreover, austerity-driven budget restrictions, inability to fill
organizational vacancies and retirement of older staff pose a threat to
maintaining Vialidad's organizational, tochnical and management quality.
This could threaten the full sustainability of the institutional
improvements which were fostered under the project.
1.20     Parts of the NTP in which the Bank invested heavily, particularly
those quantifying investment or disinvestment costs, have a limited shelf
life, as with most such plans. Suggested policy options may be more
durable when no action at all has been taken, which is often the case given
the political and economic upheavals of the past decade. The models
developed are still being used and upgraded, especially with regard to the
general analyses of grain movements and to port planning as applied to
Bahia Blanca and another Bank project currently under preparation. The NTP
final policy document (July 1987), although agreed to in principle with the
Bank, has not been implemented and is still under review by the Government.
As a technical document, it required political follow-up on high priority
areas. Changes in the Government have made this process difficult. The
transition to a civilian democracy was, ironically, a significant blow to
the DNTP as its staff hired under the military regime were initially
mistrusted (although they subsequently returned to high level position in
transport). The disappearance of the DNTP office may be the greatest loss
as its functions, which have now been subswuied under ither offices, lose
the *overall' transport perspective to the competition between the
interests of modal agencies. However, the NTP has had a positive impact on
the sector by (i) training a cadre of transport planners and economists,
who now can provide leadership in sector planning and (ii) by introducing
improved planning techniques to local transport institutions.
H.       Bank Performance
1.21     Macro-economic and political considerations overshadowed project
preparation and timing. The decision to finally appraise was based on this
being the only project which could be ready for the FY 1976 lending program
(while other export oriented projects would have been preferred by the Bank



- 8 -
as a final lending operation in Argentina). The resulting insistence on
concentrating on agricultural export oriented roads led to extensive
changes in the roads which would be included which required more
preparation (revision) time than was scheduled by the Bank. Insufficient
attention was paid to reviewing the financial and contracting capacity
requirements needed to complete the backlog of ongoing works contracts.
The appraisal mission wanted a side letter on the Government's policy to
encourage agricultural exports and, because of high inflation, on its
strategy to adjust the peso to foreign currencies. This was rejected by
the Decision Committee Meeting as the Bank felt the new Government had
imposed an adequate economic program.
1.22     In general, throughout project implementation, the Bank's
operational staff in the field, supported by divisional and departmental
management, performed well, supporting the Borrower's executing agencies
who were experiencing considerable difficulties due to economic, and at
times political, instability. The main weaknesses of the Bank's
performance stemmed from difficulties in adapting operational guidelines
(with potential precedent-setting implications for Bank operations) to an
ongoing project in unstable macro-economic conditions and, as a result,
some slow responses to assist critical project specific implementation
problems. For example, substitution of road sections (which required
changes to the loan amendment) took a very long time. The Government's
desire to delete works on three roads and substitute works on two others
was noted in a February 6. 1979 Supervision report, but not until Juno 29,
1981 was a legal amendment prepared and finally signed. As the project
wore on, it became relatively easier to increase the Bank's nominal percent
participation and to include emergency work, but the approval of
disbursement recalculation at *Historical' conversion exchange rates was
again slow in forthcoming. The May 12, 1983 supervision report recommended
that the Loan Administration Department be invited to respond to the
suggestion to disburse at the rate of exchange applicable on the date of
payments by the executing agency. The Fourth Highway Project undoubtedly
played its share in demonstrating the need for such changes. The Region's
support for Vialidad's request to be reimbursed the difference between what
they h3d actually received and what they would have received, calculated on
the basis of 'Historical Exchange' rates, in a similar manner to that then
being used in new projects, provoked the formulation of policy by PPD
regarding the conditions under which the new conversion exchange rates
policy would apply. However, not until early 1987 was the last
'adjustment' disbursement actually made. In spite of what now appears to
have been very serious financial problems, at no time was the project rated
worse than a '2' by the several teams of Bank staff who supervised the
project, since it was accepted that (i) the financial problem was
consistent with macro-economic objectives of restraining government
spending, and (ii) Vialidad was performing admirably (compared to severe
implementation and contractual problems during the 1973-76 period) in
managing the execution of the backlog of pre-1976 contracts. The lessons
of experience from this project were generally reflected in the next
Highway Sector Loan, 2229-AR.
1.23     Support by the Bank for the NTP was excellent, utilizing most of
the supervision mission's efforts during the first two years. Qualified
Bank staff were, in addition, provided to assist the NTP and to organize
the NTP's management. Without the substantial Bank staff inputs to the
NTP, there is some question that it would ever have produced the quality
data and policy papers it did.



-9-
I.       Borrower Performance
1.24     Many of the project's civil works problems stemmed from weakness
in the project preparation stages for which Vialidad must share
responsibility. Who prepared the detailed engineering is not well
documented in project files, but there are clear indications that the
importance of more detailed soils and drainage design investigations and of
the need to 'update" old designs before inviting bids were not well
appreciated. It is also not clear to what extent pavement design changes
may have been due to the supervisory consultant's differing from the
project designs. Vialidad would do well to adopt the policy that design
and construction supervision be performed by the same firm, or should, in
any event, have had the selected supervisory consulting firms review the
designs prior to inviting bids. The subsequent Bank financed project has
not had the same problems. Vialidad (and the Government) should also have
paid more attention, at the time of negotiations, to the backlog of road
contracts and the financial requirements for completing them (para. 1.6).
It appears that later Vialidad projects have benefitted from project
experience regarding the quality of detailed engineering and the need to
review, more thoroughly, Vialidad's total work program.
1.25     The Road Betterment Program, once started, was by and large well-
managed. The only real notes of management problems were: (i) in some
cases, an apparent lack of support from Vialidad for supervising
consulrants when these were disputing cost-increase claims of contractors,
and (ii) delays experienced in getting contracts rebid, which reflects
fundamental problems in contract procedures and law, common to many South
American countries.
1.26     The Borrower failed to engage consulants for the NTP, the
Pavement-Overlay study and the Traffic Safety Program within the time
periods specified. The delays in hiring consultants for the NTP were due
to the Compra Argentina* law which had to be dealt with before the needed
foreign consultants could be hired, but the other two studies could have
been started on schedule.
J.       Proiect RelationshiR
1.27     The project period covered eight years during which both the
Bank's Project Officers and the Administrator General for Vialidad changed
several times, also the responsible under-Secretary at least once. Some
delays in processing documents due to these changes are evident in the
project files, however, these were minor and, with few exceptions, the
relationship between the Bank and Vialidad appears good. The relationship
between the Bank and the Director of the NTP was also good and was fostered
by the Bank's intensive direct technical assistance.
K.       Consulting Services
1.28     Consulting services for the Road Needs and Transport Safety
studies were slow starting but were satisfactorily concluded. For the NTP,
six major contracts were awarded. Major problems (all resolved
satisfactorily) occurred in Contracts V (Coordination - to formulate
policy) and VI (Systems - to develop the computer models). Both



- 10 -
experieaced serious delays in receipt of data. There were also other minor
problems which were adequately addressed, as the comments on the Phase I
report were positive.
1.29     Vialidad prequalified consulting firms for construction
supervision with one "lead, firm also selected for coordination of
reporting. The services appear to have been well performed (no criticism
is documented in the project files), though their role in *design changesa
is not clear.
L.       Prolect Documentation and Data
1.30     The very specific list of roads and related technical data
included in Exhibit A of Schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement was drafted
specifically to give supervision missions leverage in maintaining the
design standards agreed to at appraisal. However, it became apparent
during supervision that it included too much technical detail and became
impractical to enforce and modify in detail during project implementation.
Sub-projects which ran into contractual problems or contractor failures
were tied up in lengthy legal and administrative procedures before the
remaining works could be rebid. In retrospect a list of roads in a
supplemental letter, with a provision in the Loan Agreement for possible
revision, subject to agreement by both parties, would have been preferable.
1.31     The Staff Appraisal Report provided the basis for framing the
Legal documents and provided the take-off point for drawing up detailed
terms of reference for consulting services. Given the eventual duration of
the project, the changes in Bank supervision teams, several internal Bank
management reorganizations, changes of Government and in the Borrower's
managers, the SAR also provided 'institutional memory' concerning the
project origins.
1.32     The data relevant to the NTP is well documented.  The data
regarding the Pavement Overlay and the Traffic Overlay Studies are less
well documented. The data regarding the civil works is considerably more
complicated as a result of the impact of inflation. The coordinating
"supervision consultants' fortunately prepared a remarkably comprehensive
summary report on Road Betterment civil works, through the end of 1985, but
there is scant information on emergency flood repairs. It would be useful
if the project quarterly reports had listed disbursements, and the date of
each disbursement. From the data available, it is difficult to assess the
final cost of the works and also the actual portion paid by the Bank.

PART II. PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1.       Following old procedures for preparation of Project Completion
Reports (PCR), the Borrower engaged a coordinating consultant for
supervision services on project financed civil works who, inter alia, in
early 1986 prepared a summary report on civil works sub-projects through
the end of 1985. The Borrower also provided up-dated traffic count data on
most sub-projects from the regular annual traffic count program (on
National Roads). The observations of the consultant's report were
essentially those sumarized in paragraphs 1.10 and 1.11 of Part I of this
report. The economic reevaluation of the project civil works was prepared
by Bank staff from the data provided by the Borrower including improved
vehicle operating cost data (para. 1.17, Part I). Observations on the
Institutional Studies reflect views obtained by later Bank missions from
local staff of the Borrower and some participating local consultants, as
well as through consultation with Bank staff who were engaged on the
project, in addition to documents and reports in the Bank's files.
2.       OED also invited the Borrower on September 15, 1989, to
summarize its views about the project, in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for Preparing Project Completior Reports, dated June 1989.
However, no reply was received.
