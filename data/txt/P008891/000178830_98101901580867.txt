APPRAISAL OF
TVRKII'E SINAI KALKINMA BANKASI A.S.
i.       Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi A.S. (TSKB), the first development
finance company which the Bank helped to establish, has entered its twenty-
first year. During the past twenty years, its share capital has increased
from LT 12.5 million to LT 110.5 million, its assets increased from
about LT 200 million to LT 1,300 million and it has committed $10
million in foreign exchange loans, LT 800 million in local currency loans,
and LT 200 million in equity investments. The Bank and IDA have made
eight loans and credits to TSKB totalling t88 million. IFC became
a shareholder of TSKB in 1963 and presently holds 10.8% of TSKBis paid-
in share capital.
ii.      Since 1963, the first year of Turkey's First Five Year Plan,
the average annual growth of GNP has been between 6% and 7% per annum.
The output of the manufacturing sector has doubled during the period,
and industry's share in GNP has increased from 11% to 18%. The worsening
balance of payments situation in recent years has forced the Government
to focus a program aimed at domestic self-sufficiency and intensive
import substitution. As a result, new industries have been set up behind
a protective wall of import quotas and high tariffs and favorable
monetary and credit policies, thus insulated from international competi-
tion. Since the last Bank loan was extended to TSKB, TSKB has made a
special effort to evaluate the international competitiveness of the
projects submitted to TSKB for financing. Its experience indicates
that while the methodology used may need improvement, the efforts are
worthwhile and should be continued.
iii.     On August 10, 1970, the Government devalued the Turkish lira
from LT 9 to LT 15 to the dollar, and slightly revised the interest
rate structure. Some segments of Turkish industry will now be in a
better position to expand their sales in the international markets;
others will find it difficult to compete if significant import liberali-
zation is in fact achieved. Turkey's overall post devaluation per-
formance depends heavily on how Turkey rill be able to wvork through the
severe foreign exchange problems that face it in the next few years.
TSKB which has been lending at somewhat subsidized rates, will be asked
to revise its lending rates to the new legal maximums.
iv.      Since its founding, TSKB has made a significant contribution
to the Turkish economy in providing long-term finance to the private
manufacturing sector.  During 1966-69, it has financed 11% of the gross
private manufacturing investment but its contribution has been declining
in the past 18 months due to a restricted resource position. TSKB has
intensified its resource mobilization efforts in new directions. In
January 1968, it started to guarantee bonds issued by industrial enter-
prises. In 1970, TSKB made the first underwriting of bonds as well



APPRAISAL OF
TT7M.Y, SINAI KAUXINMA BANKASI A.S.
I. INTRODUCTION
1.       Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi A.S. (Industrial Development
Bank of Turkey or TSKB) this year celebrated its 20th Anniversary.  It
is the first development finance company which the Bank helped to establish
and it was one of the first such institutions in which IFC participated
as an investor. During the past 20 years its own capital base has
expanded from an initial share capital of LT 12.5 million to a present
net worth of LT 184 million; and, it has committed US$ 150 million in
foreign exchange loans, LT 800 million in local currency loans and
LT 200 million in equity participations. At present the company has
assets totalling about LT 1,300 million. The Bank and IDA have made
loans and credits to TSKB totalling US$88 million.  IFC s present invest-
ment in TSKB is about US$1.3 million (at cost) and this holding repre-
sents about 10.8% of TSKB's share capital. All the Bank loans and IDA
credits have been fully committed by TSKB.
2.       TSKB's fortunes over the past 20 years have, quite naturally,
reflected the general climate for private sector industrial activity
in Turkey. The 20th Anniversary of the company has provided a con-
venient time for TSKB to assess what TSKB has become, what it has
accomplished and what new paths it might pursue in its next decade of
operations. This report,therefore, first focuses on TSKB's contribu-
tion to industrial financing and its institutional performance, parti-
cularly during the period since the previous appraisal report
(No. DB-44a - February 17, 1969). Details on TSKB's organizational
and financial structure can be found in the previous appraisal report
and the annexes to this report. The second part of the current report
concerns TSKB fs prospects and potential contribution to Turkish develop-
ment in the coming years, from the perspective of an institution
that over its first 20 years concentrated its efforts in direct in-
dustrial lending. A detailed description of TSKBts economic setting
can be found in the latest economic report on Turkey (EMA-4a -
February 13, 1969).
II. TSKB's ENVIRONMENT AND ROLE
General Economic Climate
3.       In the past few years TSKB has operated in an environment
where industrial activity has been vibrant, new industrial possibili-
ties plentiful, and industrial entrepreneurs in the private sector
relatively aggressive in seeking out new investment opportunities. On
the other side of the scale severe foreign exchange restraints on
the economy (and on TSKB) have acted as a brake on industrial activity
and efficiency; an unrealistic interest rate structure has made it

impossible for ;SKB to raise money on its own account in the market;
and a severe distortion of the market-pricing mechanism and an almost
absolute protection of the domestic market have made it possible for
relatively inefficient enterprises to survive.
4.       In terms of production, the manufacturing sector in Turkey,
While still small relative to total output (about 18% of GNP) has
doubled its output in the 1963-1969 period. Growth in this sector
has significantly outstripped the overall rate of growth of real GNP,
which has been between 6% and 7% per annum over the period mentioned.
The pattern of manufacturing investment shifted in favor of the pri-
vate sector after 1964. Since that year private manufacturing has
accounted for about 55% of total manufacturing investment and while the
statistics are not conclusive, the output of the private sector in
manufacturing has probably surpassed that of the public sector. This
has come about with explicit Government support as a wide range of
fiscal incentives have been offered to private sector investments.
5.       At present Turkey has reached a stage where it is, or soon
will be, producing such basic items as steel, copper, aluminium, lead
and zinc. A wide variety of engineering products are also made, as
are phosphate and nitrogen type fertilizers. Synthetic fibre production
is expanding rapidly and major plastic raw material production has
been initiated. In short, progress in Turkey, in terms of the physi-
cal output of industry, has been remarkable and some of the more recent
emphasis given by Government in the industrial field, such as pro-
motion of private investment and a greater willingness to accept
foreign investors in joint enterprise forms, have been commendable.
6.       Where the problems have centered, as mentioned above, is in
the establishment of a market economy to subject both the private and
public manufacturing sectors to the discipline of competition. The
rigid import control system almost completely insulated Turkish
industry from international competition and it has been only recently
that any emphasis has been given by the Government to encouraging
exporting industry. In the 1963-1968 period, manufactured exports
were stagnant at an average of about US$48 million per annum,
i.e. about 10o of total exports.  In 1969, they were double this
average, with large gains in processed food and textile exports,
following the application of 10% - 40% cash rebates on f.o.b. prices
to exporting manufacturers.
7.       In the early months of the summer, credit tightened severely,
to the extent that local currency financing became almost as diffi-
cult a problem as securing foreign exchange, which itself was becoming
ever more scarce.  On August 10, 1970, the Government devalued the
Turkish Lira from LT 9 to LT 15 to the dollar, and revised interest
rates slightly upward (see paras. 21-29).  These measures, plus others,
have been taken in the hope of liberalizing Turkey's economy and



- 3 -
alleviating the severe bal-ince of payments problems of the country.
While it is too early to forecast the effectiveness of the new measures,
some segments of Turkish industry will certainly be put on a more com-
petitive base vis-a-vis foreign manufactures and for a wide range of non-
durable consumer goods competitiveness should be achieved. Marginal
firms no doubt will find it difficult to compete in a more liberalized
trading situation, if this is in fact achieved, and some failures are
to be expected.  This, together with Turkey's recent decision to associate
with the EEC, which means declining tariffs on Turkish manufactured ex-
ports to EEC countries, should enable Turkey to make significant e.port
gains, provided price increases can be kept at reasonable levels after
the devaluation and the severe foreign exchange bottleneck can be dealt
with effectively in the 1970-1973 period.
8.     Investment targets for private manufacturing investment in 1970
are about US$4oo million, a 25% increase over 1969. Following devalua-
tion there has been some slackening in the pace of development of
new investment plans, and thus this target may be on the high side.  It
is interesting, however, that all of TSKB's approved projects that are
in the pre-disbursement stage are expected to move forward on schedule
on the basis of recalculated costs made by TSKB and the respective
sponsors. The other uncertain element that could affect investment
in the coming months is the political strength of the Prime Mlinister
and his Justice Party when Parliament reconvenes this month.   In any event,
there are no signs of a significant slump in economic activity.
Financing of Industry
9.     In the 1966-1969 period gross private manufacturing investment
totalled about US$1 billion. On the basis of disbursements TSKB financed
about 11% of this total.  However, TSKB's relative contribution has not
been constant over the four years but has declined relative to total
private manufacturing investment due to a restricted resource position.
TSKB's volume of business in 1966-1969 and the first four months of 1970
is sholw in Annex 6. 1969 aggregate approvals dropped significantly
relative to the three previous years. Local currency loan approvals in
1969 amounted to LT 5 million compared with an average of LT 82.3 million
during the three years, 1966-1968. Disbursements showed the same trend,
only less sharply. Foreign currency loan approvals and disbursements
in 1969, amounting to US$13.6 million and US$17.8 million respectively,
were 33% and 28% lower than the respective averages of the pr>>-.rous
three years. The upward trend sustained in 1966-1968 for equity commit-
ments was also reversed, with total equity investments dropping from
LT 38.3 million in 1968 to LT 12.6 million in 1969. During the first
six months of 1970, approvals of foreign exchange loans and local
currency loans amounted to US$16.9 million and LT 8.5 million respectively.



10v      TSKBts level of operat.ons has, in recent years, been more
a function of the availability of fresh resources than the demand
for finance by the industrial sector. The low level of business in
1969 reflects the fact that TSKB has met considerable difficulties in
raising sufficient resources. However, even given more adequate re-
sources TSKB's share of total gross private manufacturing investment
would no doubt still have fallen because Turkey is beginning to ex-
perience the establishment of large industrial units and some of these
are of a size that are beyond the scope of TSKB, which is not in a
position to commit more than US$5 - US$6 million dollars equivalent
to a single enterprise.  Also, and this is a healthy sign, there has
been a noticeable increase in direct private foreign investment
(about US$40 million last year), which has covered some of the rapidly
growing demand for investment funds.
11.      Based on a sample of TSKB financed projects over the past
few years, the typical financing package consists of TSKB loan funds
totalling 25% - 30% of the project cost, shareholder funds amounting
to 55% (in which TSKB sometimes also participates) and the balance is
split between deferred payment of customs duties, commercial bank
credit and Industrial Investment and Credit Bank (SYKB) loans   Com-
mercial banks in Turkey do not provide long-term credits but they do
continuously roll over short-term loans and, they are quite active in
taking equities. Mlost banks have a number of firms in their port-
folios which they have started and which they control. (Total equity
investments   of   private banks, at cost, totalled about LT 850
million at the end of 1969. The market value is considerably more.)
12.      The only other institutional source of term finance for the
private sector in Turkey is SYKB, which was established in 1963 by
five commercial banks. Its primary source of funds is long-term loans
(20-year, lump-sum repayment) received from its shareholders (based
on their deposits) and it has become an increasingly important source
for lira funds. In 1969 its commitments were about US$30 million
equivalent, slightly higher than TSKB's commitments for the year. How-
ever, it too has had recently to cut back operations due to a drop in
the rate of increase of fresh resources.
13.      While not a source of finance, the Union of Chambers of
Commerce and Industry figures prominently in Turkey because it allocates
foreign exchange (from governmental sources) for private sector imports
of capital and intermediate goods. An industrialist wanting to import
capital goods can get his foreign exchange in three ways: (i) from
the Union semi-annual quota of US$15 million for capital goods imports,
(ii)- from TSKB's foreign exchange loans and (iii) from participatiors
from foreign investors. The Union of Chambers has a rather mechanical
point system for allocating its funds; it claims that applications
are currently running at 10 times the funds available for capital goods
imports.

Resource  7bi27ation by TSYB
14.     A long range objective of TSKB is to see itself develop as a
mobilizer of capital not only from governmental, foreign and multi-
national aid agencies, out also from private markets in Turkey and
abroad. While TSKB's achievements in this area in the past two decades
have been modest, the company has, particularly in the last two or
three years, made some progress and should be in a position to do more
provided its efforts are not circumscribed by policies beyond its con-
trol or by an economic climate that frustrates its efforts.
15.     Foreign Exchange.  Except for a U.S. Government loan of US$10
million in 155, TSKB depended entirely on IBRD/IDA financing for its
foreign exchange business until 1965. Until then, the BankilDA had
provided a total of US$38 million.  However, in the past five years
TSKB has broadened its foreign exchange sources so that the breakdown
of foreign loans received from its inception to September 30, 1970 is
now as follows (See Annex 5 for details):
Amount      Percentage
IBRD/IDA                    US$ 88 million       6C%
European Investment Bank
(EIB)                         30   "           20%
AID/DLF (TJ. S. Government)     23  tt           15%
Kreditanstalt fur
WAederaufbau                   8                5%
US$151 million      100%
This broadening of TSKB's sources of supply for foreign capital has
been a favorable development. As for tapping private sources overseas,
Turkey's economic situation in the recent past did not permit this.
TSKB has not been very active in bringing foreign investors in to
participate with its Turkish clients as a means of mobilizing both
foreign capital and technology. The reason probably is that this is
a difficult job in any circumstances, and in Turkey, where, at least
until recently, foreign investment has been discouraged rather than
encouraged, the climate has been particularly unfavorable for private
foreign investment. However, if Turkey succeeds in liberalizing its
economy and begins to seriously attempt to look outward and to compete
in international markets, the linkage of Turkish firms with foreign
enterprise will become more important and TSKB could serve a useful
function in this area. There are signs that both the Government and
private investors are beginning to sense the contributions foreign
investors can make and there appears to be an upsurge of such invest-
ment.



-6-
16.      Local  urren<a.  TSMM's record of domestic currency resource
mobilization is as follows (to June 30, 1970):
Amount      Percentage
Governmental credits/bonds           LT 471 million      53%
Share capital/retained earnings/
provisions                             213   "         24%
Portfolio equity sales to the
public                                102   t          11%
Bond issues of firms guaranteed
by TSKB                               105  it          12%
LT 891 million    100%
The two factors that impinge most directly on TSKB's local resource
mobilization efforts are the state of development of the capital
market and the interest rate structure in the country.
17.      Share Market.  While there is a long-established stock ex-
change in Istanbul it exists in form only. There is essentially no
trading in the private stocks or bonds being handled by the listed
brokers, who depend for a livelihood on other types of business. The
trading that is registered consists mainly of direct sales by TSKB out
of its equity portfolio b ,means of public advertisement. While this
has been modest in amount-', TSKB has virtually been the only source
of equities for the public. There are only about 10 companiest shares
(banks included) that are traded, even moderately, over the stock
exchange.  Typical dividend yields on these shares are 8% - 10%.  In
selling shares from its portfolio, TSKB currently establishes its
prices on the basis that the company should give an earnings yield of
about 20% and a dividend yield of about 10%.
18.      On rare occasions there have been direct public issues by
manufacturing concerns, but most profitable companies raise their
equity privately from among the enterprisest sponsors. The problems,
endemic to all such infant markets, standing in the way of a more
rapid development of an equity market are: (i) entrepreneurs who
are reluctant to bring in outsiders and who therefore limit their
sights to projects wrhich can be based on the equity and retained
earnings which theyr themselves can provide, (ii)  a public that is
uninformed concerning security operations and (iii) the absence of
/ TSKBIs equity portfolio sales (at sales value):

an organized secondary n.arket to provide liquidity.Z/
19.      TSIB has made a contribution in dealing with the first two of
these problems through its efforts to obtain and then to sell equities
to the public.  IVEth respect to the third, there may be scope for TSKT
to "take a market" in shares. A recent reorganization in TSKB has
established a securities marketing unit which is creatively exploring
what TSKB can do in this area. As a matter of stated policy TSK8 hopes
to concentrate its somewhat scarce lira resources on developing its
equity portfolio in order to provide more shares for the public and
higher yields for TSKB. This approach should be encouraged. One
potential problem in pursuing this policy is that the State Planning
Organization (SPO) has let it be known that it frowns on TSKB holding
both the shares and debt instruments of a given company. TSKB must
secure SPO approval for all such operations and while this is an incon-
venience it has not, so far, limited TSKB's effectiveness in this
area.
20.      Fund Mobilization at Project Level.  TSKB cannot take all the
credit responsible for mobilizing funds, other than its own, at the
project level; nevertheless, it is true that TSKB provides, on average,
only about 28% of the cost of the projects it finances and that TSKB
has been pushing its borrowers, as a condition for lending, to increase
their equity capital to levels that have put an increasing burden on
the sponsors of the borrowing enterprises.
21.      Interest Rates. While the Government initially provided
TSKB with substantial lira resources, severe budget restraints have
restricted such funds in recent years to insignificant amounts. This
situation is not likely to change. Meanwhile, TSKB has been blocked
from direct approaches to the market by the interest rate structure
imposed on it. Much thought has been given to the rationalization
of interest rates in Turkey and TSKB has been the major contributor
to a technical working group that proposed a revised interest rate
structure.
22.      Private capital in Turkey is mobilized largely through the
banking system. Insurance companies and pension funds (outside the
State Pension Fund, whose investments go to the public sector, and
2/ Legislation concerning the orderly development of the share and
bond market continues to be stalled in inter-ministerial debate. As
presently planned, the legislation contains serious defects in the
proposals for a regulatory agency (which could end up being a politi-
cal body), unrealistic requirements for auditors to fulfill (there is
no auditing profession in Turkey) and no real incentives offered for
tightly held companies to go public. If this legislation remains
stalled, or if it is ineffective, standard-setting and self-regulation
by the institutions involved in the market would be an important step
forward. TSKB?s Managing Director and some of its key staff have con-
tributed significantly to the private group that has worked on various
legislative proposals relating to the capital market.



- 8 -
the Military Pension Fund, which invests in its own ventures) are in their
earliest stages,  Hwever, the banks have in fact mobilized significant
resources. Commerical and savings deposits of private banks for example
have grown from LT 16 billion in 1966 to LT 27 billion at the end of 1969.
(Performance in 1970 has, however, been much below the rate of growth in
1969 and an extremely tight market has re9ulted.) Banks have paid from
2% to e on deposits, depending on their term, which, together with
lottery prizes, on average, come to about 10% of interest payments made
to depositors. At the same time the Government had put an artificially
low ceiling on bank interests charges to borrowers of 10.5% (plus a 20%
tax paid by the borrower), but this is effectively circumvented by other
fees and charges and the effective cost of commercial bank credit is 15% -
20% depending on the borrewer. The large margins enjoyed by the banks
have resulted in heated competition for deposits, mainly through excessive
advertising and multifarious branches.  There are now close to 3,000 banking
offices accepting deposits from the public and the system is generally
inefficientl/.
23.      Long-term lending institutions, however (principally TSKB and the
Industrial Investment and Credit Bank - SYKB), have been subject to arti-
ficially low rates: 9% on foreign exchange loans, 10.5% on free lira funds
and 8% on lira resources provided by the Government. (These rates were
also subject to a 20% tax, paid by the borrower.) This rate structure has
resulted in two readily apparent problems for TSKB. First, its borrowers
are obtaining funds at subsidized rates of interest.  Second, it is effec-
tively blocked from raising term funds in the market since it would have
to pay more for the funds than it could charge.
24.      Following devaluation a new interest rate regime was announced.
On the deposit side, the major change was an increase in the rate paid on
one year plus time deposits from 6.5% to 9%. The basic lending rate was
increased from 10.5% to 11.5%. However, on loans to "promoted" industries,
which is a broad list, the lending rate is held at 10.5%.
25.      In addition, the SP0 has introduced a rebate system that complicates
matters, and to some extent dilutes the effects of the somewhat higher
lending rate schedule. Na1imely, individual enterprises involved in a wide
range of activities (tourim, ship-building, industries earmarked for
"encouragement", exporting, some agricultural loans, etc.) will be able
to obtain cash rebatos from the Government equivalent to a 1% to 5% decrease
in the interest rate paid an loans from cemmercial banks and the Turkiye
Halk Bankasi (small business lending bank). Similarly, the banks granting
such loans will receive a cash subsidy from the Government on such loans
equivalent to a 1% to 3% effective increase in their lending rates, if
the loans are made out of their equity or deposit funds. Loans from TSKB,
Sinayii Yatirim Kredi Bankasi (see para. 11), and the State Investment
Bank, are exempt from these privileges.
1/ Despite the wide margins, the aggregate net profits of private banks
as a percentage of net worth was about 16% in 1968 even though the aggregate
ratio of total liabilities to net worth was high at 18:1.



26.     To what extent the rebate system Twill apply to overall credit operations
is unclear. Administrative problems will no doubt arise given the complexity of
the system. Long-term lending institutions do not receive the benefits available
to other banks, which is satisfactory from the point of view of keeping these
institutions' rates relatively less subsidized in a tight credit marketIai but
which would have a discriminatory impact should the credit market ease. In short,
the new system is complex, and in any event is an ineffective way of trying to
direct resource allocations.
27.     Although in the past TS313 has been under some governmental pressure to
charge less than the legal maximum interest - in its Government lonn agreements
it had contractual obligations to this effect - the Bank feels, and TSKB has
agreed that the company's rates should more closely follow market rates and that
it therefore should charge the legal maximum rates on all its operations. It is
expected that about 70% of TSKB's lending would qualify for the 10.5% rate.  For
such loans, the improvements would be that TSKB's foreign exchange would cost bor-
rowers 1.5% more than previously and its local currency financed from Government
funds winll cost borrow-ers 2.5% more, plus, of course, the increased differential
resulting from the new 25%o transaction tax.  The rest of TSKB's lending would
then be at the 11.5% maximum rate, and thus the gain would be more substantial.
The actual cost to borrowers, cum taxes, at the two rates will be 13.1% and 14.4%
respectively.
28.     TSK3 has renegotiated its various loan agreements with the Government to
the effect that all its funds will be lent at the legal maximum rates, while the
spread earned by TS,3 on such funds prior to the rate increase will be maintained
at the same levels that applied previously.
29.     These rates still leave the effective cost of long-term funds slightly be-
low the 15/-17% market cost of 5-year bonds.  However, the Government is exceed-
ingly reluctant to further revise interest rates at this time, and application of
the rates to TSX3's lending is at least a significant improvement on what it has
been able to charge in the past. The impact of the increased rates on borrowers
is small. TSKB loans on average amount to about 20% of total debts incurred by
its clients and the impact of the new rates would be a decline in average before
tax earnings of only about 2%.
30.     Dond Market.  As credit has tightened in the past two years and TSKB was
itself blocked from borrowing in the market, the possibility of bond issues of
industrinl clients arose and in January 1968 TSKB pioneered with offering, on a
best efforts basis for one of its clients, an LT 5 million, 5-year bond at 12%.
The payment of principal and interest was guaranteed by TSKi. Since that issue
many banks have followed TSI3's lead and large well-known enterprises have gone
directly to the market with non-guaranteed issues. In 1968 these issues totalled
LT 104 million; in 1969 LT 170 million; and in 1970, to-date, LT 273 million. In
1970 TSIM made the first underwritin- of bonds of industrial comnanies as well as
guaranteeing the principal and interest. Its effective, discounted yield on
guaranteed, best efforts issues is about 2.25%. For underwriting it charges, in
addition, a 3% underwriting fee.
1/ Even after the subsidies, the effective charges paid to commercial banks
for normal industrial credit wsould not likely be lower than the long-term
rates from TSKBM and SYKB under the new regiie.



-10-
31.       Because the bond business is in such a new market, there is consider-
able uncertainty about its absorbtive capacity and in recent weeks issues wAth
coupon rates of even 14% or 15, have not been fully subscribed. The Goverrnment
has set a 15'p maximum coupon rate, and does not allow issues at below par. Not
unexpectedly other problems have arisen as this new market has blossomed. For
example, many bond buyers evidently thought they were buyin.g shares and are now
somewhat disillusioned. Secondly, with no organized secondary market, bonds are
not liquid and this may now be having a dampening effect. Just as TSKB is ex-
ploring the possibility of making a market in shares, there may also be scope for
TSE10 doing the same thing with bonds.  This is, of course, a difficult area in
which to operate in Turkish conditions and TSKB is understandably cautious about
moving too rapidly into this business.
32.       Prospects for TSKB's Plobilization Efforts.  Concerning foreign exchange,
the Bank, KfW and. EI3 remain the primary sources for TSMB. However, the company
is aware that it needs to broaden as eerly as possible its sources of funds.  This
matter was discussed at length during negotiations and TSKB has agreed that it
should intensify its efforts in this re-ard. (see para. 65)
33.       On the local currency side, TS'(B's mobilization efforts will continue
to be through bond issues for its clients, sales out of its equity portfolio,
internal cash generation and occasional increases in its capital. A direct ap-
proach to the market by TSK3 is not likely to be possible (and its bond issue
w^-ork makes it less necessary), with one possible exception. That is, given a
higher lending rate, TSKB might be able to sell one or two year paper in the
market at perhaps lOp. These funds could be used to finance the early maturities
of its local currency loan nortfolio. There are various legal problems in doing
this and the Central Bank may disallow such paper but TSKB is now exploring the
possibilities.
Resource Allocation by TSX3
34.       Undoubtedly TSKB's major contribution in Turkey has been that it has
served as a vehicle through which funds could be channeled to industry on the
basis of a selection process that considered the basic elements critical to mak-
ing a given industrial operation a success. Currently over 400 individual com-
panies are on TSKB's books and the number of projects reviewed over its 20 year
history is several times greater.  In view of its development of a well trained
and diversified staff, TSKB has made a significant contribution in Turkey just
in terms of project selection. The performance of its portfolio over a 20 year
span (see paragraph 47) bears more than adequate witness to TSIE's ability to
judge the financial prospects of its clients. TSEB has taken risks, and experi-
enced losses, but its overall performance, including periods of recession as
well as expansion, has been commendable.  However, several years ago it became
clear that the distortions in the pricing system were becoming of such dimensions
that financial viability was not the only indicator that needed to be evaluated
to judge a project and TSi3 set out to meet this problem.



- 11 -
35.        Economic Criteria.  As noted, Turkey has been following an industrial
policy which encouraged import substitution industries by establishing restric-
tions on imports through import quotas and high tariffs. As Turkey's balance of
payments has deteriorated, the restrictions have reached levels that have virtu-
ally isolated Turkish industry from international competition. The absence of
international competition has enabled some inefficient enterprises to survive
and prosper in the unchallenged local markets. Coupled with monetary and credit
policies which imposed limitations on the flows of funds, the protective mea-
sures have created a distorted situation and helped to perpetuate an inefficient
industrial structure.
36.        In view of this, TSKB began to try to develop some economic tests to
apply along with its normal financial tests. At the time of the previous Bank
loan, its attempts were refined and a method of analysis was agreed that would
give, in addition to the normal profitability criterion, a measure of a bor-
rower's competitiveness under conditions simulating free trade. TSKB has been
using this method in all its appraisals, irrespective of size and whether Bank
funds were involved or not, and its economic and engineering staff have made
great efforts to apply the test, which in some cases is extremely difficult.
TSMB's experience indicates that, with the exception of comnanies whose prod-
ucts have variable specifications, cotton textiles for example, where the test
is almost impossible to apply, the major new or expansion projects have passed
the test, i.e. net effective protection on value added has been below 15% - 20%,
at an exchange rate of LT 15 = US$1. Few projects have been rejected on the
grounds of this test alone. (Projects that have failed often have had other
obvious defects.)  Nevertheless, TSI3 considers it well worth the effort to ap-
ply the test as a means of having some idea of the relative contributions of
various projects.
37.        For small expansion and modernization projects, the test has been
difficult to apply. TSIM has attempted to cost these projects at the margin
and the basic data used in these attempts is subject to many judgments and
problems. lal such projects tested have passed the criterion, but TSKB has
not felt the results were very meaningful, while the time taken to subject
the projects to this scrutiny was disproportionate to the benefits.  During
negotiations, agreemernt was reached on ways of simplifying the analysis of
effective protection and ways of tightening the criteria as it applied to
small expansion or moderni&ation projects. Elimination of the shadow exchange
rate as a result of the devaluation is, of course, a major simplification. At
the same time, TSK3 had agreed to reduce to the lowest level possible its
ad hoc financing of sundry items for existing companies (equipment purchases
not related to a significant modernization or expansion program) unless it can
be demonstrated that the company is reasonably comnetitive and that the need
is critical for the continued efficient operation of the plant. (see para. 46)

38.      In the cotton and blend textile sector, where the test is also
difficult to apply, TSKB is participating with the Bank in a sector study
whichhopefully will conclude with some guidelines as to the types of textiles
projects in which Turkey is competitive and for which there may be export
potential developing. TSKB has also been doing some sub-sector studies
on its own, particularly in cases where it has a multiple of applications
for plants oroducing the same item. On the basis of such studies TSKB's
Board formulates its lending policies toward the sub-sectors examined.
During the past two years, TSKB has made studies on the sub-sectors related
to paper, steel foundries, automobile parts, cement, wood products and
canning. TSKB would like to devote more energy to such projects in the
future.
39.      In providing finance to the private sector, TSKB has not made a
special effort in the past to encourage export-oriented industries. In
1968, the total exports of all its clients amounted to $13.6 million; in
1969, there was only a slight increase to $14.3 million. This represents
only about 3% of the exporting firms' total sales and about 16% of Turkey's
total manufactured exports. In light of the balance of payments situation
in Turkey, it is of great importance that industries increase their export
capacitY.  This wias discussed with TSKB and TSKB has agreed to intensify
its efforts first to find, and then to-finance, those projects with direct
export potential. This aspect of TSKB's work will be carefully followed.
40.      Other Aspects of-Appraisal Work.  TSKB is equipped with a relatively
large appraisal staff (15 financial analysts, 16 engineers and 13 economists)
who are experienced in appraising the financial, technical and market aspects
of the projects sulmitted to it. The analyses are generally very thorough,
although the written reports have suffered from a lack of full coordination
of work between the three appraisal groups (see paragraph 49). Nevertheless,
TSKB goes into unusual detail, relative to many development finance companies,
in its analyses of projects. All full applications must go to the Board,
even those bearing a negative recommendation.TSKB not infrequently turns
down projects on the basis of inadequate capacity as well as for financial
and managerial reasons.
41.      Project Supervision.  In respect of end-use work, TSKB's performance
has improved significantly in recent years. The End-Use Department has 8
financial analysts and 2 civil engineers. Apart from examining the reports
regularly submitted by the borrowers, the staff visit, and report on the
companies whose loans from TSKB exceed LT 500,000 (now about 300 in number)
at least once a year. In 1969, a total of 325 visits were made, including
23 visits to ccmpanies in which TSKB had equity investments. In general,
the reports are reasonably adequate in presenting the progress of the
projects and the performance of the borrowers. An effort is made in each
case to determine the causes for any discrepancies between projections and
actual results, and a consolidated report on this matter is prepared each
year for the majority of projects completed during the year. These reports
have been found useful by the management and by the staff of other depart-
ments. In order to improve the utility of end-use reports for the financial
analysts who are responsible for reapDraising existing clients for further
lending or additional equity participation, TSKB is rethinking some of the
details of the present form of its end-use reports.



- 13 -
42.      Since TSEB has standardized the financial reporting from its
clients it is building up a data base with which it can analyze the finan-
cial performance and financial structure of its clients on a sectoral basis
as well as the consolidated position of firms accounting for the bulk of
its loan and equity portfolio.
Features of TSKB Operations
43.      Details on the nature of TSKB's recent lending activity are given
in Annexes 7, 8 and 9. Two aspects deserve particular comment: the size
distribution and the georaphic distribution of its operations.
44.      TSKB's lending has been characterized by a large number of rela-
tively small loans and a few relatively large loans. The average size of
foreign exchange loans committed in 1969 and the first four months of 1970
has in fact declined. The following table summarizes the size of loans
committed since January 1967:
1967     1968     1969        1970
(h months)
Foreign Currency Loans
Average size (US$ 'ooo)       268       419      246        227
Loans under US$200,000
as % of toal number          70%       74%      78%        81%
as % of total amount         19%      12%       39%        48%
Local Currency Loans
Average size (LT '000)      1,244    2,395    2,156       6,000
Loans under LT 2 million
as % of total number         86%       69%      77%        -
as % of total amount         49%       25%      38%        _
On a project basis (lira and foreign exchange combined), in 1969, 59 out
of 75 loans approved were below US$200,000 equivalent, representing 37%
of the total amount of loans approved by TSKB.
45.      The high proportion of small foreign exchange loans reflects the
fact that many loans were used by the borrovers to import replacement
equipment rather than for adding substantially to capacity. They applied
for foreign exchange loans from TSKB no doubt mainly because of a need for
foreign exchange rather than credit.!/ It is also related, to some extent,
to the fact that the KiW does not want TSKB to commit more than $250,000
equivalent of its funds to a single project.
I/ A sample of 48 sub-loans extended in 1969 indicates the following: only
eight loans were above US$200,000 and 19 loans were below US$100,000. The
average total assets of the latter 19 borrowers was US$2 million equivalent
indicating the smallness of the loans relative to the sizes of the borrowers.



- 14 -
46.    TSKB has agreed to make a greater effort to limit its expenditures
in time and funds on such business so that it can concentrate on its major
aim of providing capital for project financing, wrhere considerable results
can be realized (see paragraph 37).
47.    With respect to the geographic distribution of its business, during
1967-1969, enterprises in the Marmara Sea region continued to absorb the
major portion of TSKB's financing. In fact, the percentage has increased
from 75.9% in 1967, to 79.2% in 1968 and 85.5% in 1969. About 65% of TSKB's
loans on average were made to enterprises in, or adjacentto, Istanbul.
The Adana area received 17.6% in 1967, which dropped to 4j.6% in 1968 and
1.3% in 1969. The Izmir area received 4.9% in 1967, 12% in 1968 and 5%
in 1969. The remainder was distributed elsewhere in Turkey, much of it
in the Ankara area.  The regional distribution of TSKB's lending over its
20 year history closely parallels this recent pattern: i.e., Marmara Sea
75%, Adana/Cukurova 8% and Aegean 12%. This pattern has resulted in criti-
cism of TSKB as institution favoring Istanbul business. This is discussed
further in the next section. (Paragraph 53)

III. INSTITUTIONAL DEVLOPMENTS AND CREDITWORTHNSS
Board and Management
48.       Since early 1969 several important changes have taken place in
TSKBts managerial structure.  First of all, Mr. Ferid Basmaci, General
Manager of the Is Bankasit TSKB!s largest shareholder, replaced M4r. Bulent
Yazici (former Is Bankasi General Manager) as Chairman of TSKB, and the
latter was made Managing Director of the bank.  Since this change, Mr. Yazici
has devoted more time to TSKB affairs, particularly in the areas of policy
and planniing. He has made a valuable contribution and TSKB profits from the
additional time he is now able to devote to it. Mqr. Resid Serif Egeli, the
General Manager, retains that position but he is no longer on the Board.
49.       Secondly, responsibilities were rearranged among three Assistant
General Managers so that for the first time anl departments dealing directly
with appraisals (Engineering, Economics and Finance) report to one Assistant
General Manager.  This has been a useful change as it has begun to improve
communications and coordination among the appraising staff.}/
Staff
50.       TSKB has a sizeable, and highly trained, professional staff of
about 100. Fortunately its earnings have allowed a degree of professionalism
that many other development finance companies cannot afford. It has for
example an engineering staff of 16 and a group of economists of similar size.
TSKB has made it possible for many of its staff to obtain training and
further education overseas. A number of its staff have received training at
the EDI and in the BATK/IFC.  While, as a result of rapid industrial growth,
attractive employment opportunities exist in private industry for many of
its staff, there has been surprisingly little turnover in TSKB. In the past
hz years, for example, only h resignations have occurred.
51.       TSKB's administrat-ive costs are high relative to other development
finance companies of a similar age and size. There are three main reasons
for this. First, as mentioned above, TSKB has a highly trained and diversi-
fied staff. Secondly, it undertakes some quasi-banking functions, such as
opening letters of credit, that require a sizeable group of admLnistrators
and clerks. Finally, Istanbul is an expensive city with rapidly escalating
costs in recent years.  TSKBJs salary bill has increased about one-third in the
past two years with no staff expansion whatsoever. TSKB's management states
that this has been necessary to maintain TSKB's position in the employment
market. No expansion of professional staff is expected in the next two
years.
1/ Another significant improvement will take place when TSKB moves into its
new building.  At present, the economists, engineers and follow-up staff are
about a half mile from TSKB's main office



- 16 -
52.     Nevertheless, economies can no doubt be achieved and other
institutional and organizational improvements realized. After 20 years of
operation there is always the danger of losing objectivity as how first to
visualize, and then to promote, profitable change and with this in view
TSKB hired an international consulting firm to undertake a six-month study
of its operating procedures and organization. This study is just being
completed and substantial organizational changes are being recommended. It
is too early to see exactly what impact this review will have; as a minimum,
substantial simplification (and hence cost reductions) of its accounting
and record-keeping activities should be achieved.
Relationships with Government and Industry
53.     TSKB is currently under heavy criticism from some quarters in
Turkey. To a great extent this reflects the overall economic situation where
severe shortages of both local currency and long-term foreign exchange financ-
ing exist. TSKB has, to a ceztain extent, had to slow down its pace of
operations to spread available resources over a longer period of time and
this has caused complaints from borrowers.  Secondly, there is the geographic
problem referred to earlier. While the best estimates available indicate
that the geographic dispersion of TSKB's financing parallels the overall
industrial investment dispersion in the country, industrialists outside the
Marmara Sea region view TSKB as an Istanbul-oriented bank. TSKB has not
made an impact on the dispersal of industry in the country.  This has result-
ed in recurrent expressions of interest in t,wo regions (Aegean and Cukurova)
for regional development finance companiesl/.  This problem was discussed
with TSKB at negotiations and there are indications that TSKB is taking steps
to deal with it.  First, TSKB plans to add some appraisal staff to its Adana
office. Second, it plans to open a branch office in Izmir, headed by a
senior staff member and equipped with an appraisal group. Third, it is
creating a new department in Istanbul that will be responsible for project
promotion and business developm.ent outside the Istanbul area. Given limited
resources, however, and a high rate of investment in the Marmara Sea region,
a dramatic shift in the regional allocation of TSKB's funds is not likely
in the coming two years. The encouraging sign is that TSKB is alive to the
problem.
54.     TSKB's relations with the Government center on TSKB's contact with
the State Planning Organization (SPO). The SPO is closely involved with
industrial investment in that its approval is required for any of the tax
incentives available for industry in Turkey and it must also approve all
projects utilizing more than US$200,000 in foreign exchange. (This approval
is required by TSKB before it will investigate a project.) In the course
of events TSKB and SPO have had different views on particular projects and
1/ The most advanced plan is the proposal now being formulated by foreign
consultants for a private development finance company in the Cukurovaregion.
This is one outgrowth of a regional development plan prepared for that
area.



- 17 -
this has caused not unexpectedly, a certain degree of mutual skepticism.
Ihe SPO would, in addition to its planning and investment approval functions,
like to have the resources to give more meaning to its decisions and it has
therefore been the main proponent of the establishment of a ne* Export
Development Bank, which has been discussed for a number of years. This
would be a Government-owned, SPO-controlled institution that would lend to
the private sector. The Government hopes to see it established before year-
end. The main impact of such an institution on TSKB is that the new bank
will absorb resources, particularly lira funds, that might otherwise have been
available to TSK3.  In surrmary, while problems exist between SPO and TSKB, they
have not so far noticeably diainished the effectiveness with which TSKB
carries on its business.
Financial Status and Creditworthiness
55.       TSKB remains profitable (Annex 10).  Even after a capital increase
in 1969, net profits after taxes and provisions for possible losses, were
equivalent to about 16.3% of year-end net worth. Out of net profits totalI.
ling LT 30.0 million in 1969, only LT 9.9 million was distributed; the rest
was retained in the coapany.  Although there is little trading in TSKB's
shares (only about 1% turnover of outstanding shares per annum) the price
has held at about 240% of par, representing a price-earnings ratio of about
6:1. TSKB continues to pay a 12% dividend and also last year issued free
bonus shares (1 share for every 5 held).
56.       As for TSKBI's financial structure and its portfolio (Annex ll),
the ratio of TSKB's total debt to net worth has changed little in the past
three years, even though total assets have expanded at the average rate of
24% per annum to LT 1,333 million (gross assets plus guaranteed bonds) at
the end of 1969. This is because of the substantial increase in the companyis
equity during this period (about 30% per annum on average). The overall
debt/equity ratio, including guarantees outstanding, was 5.9:1 at the end
of 1969.
57.       Following the devaluation of the Turkish Lira from LT 9 to LT 15
per U.S. dollar on August 10, 1970, TSKB carried out an analysis of the
impact of the changes on its clients and its portfolio. All companies
having substantial foreign exchange obligations to TSKB were reviewed in
order to turn up those cases where debt servicing or debt/equity relations
might give problems, at least in the near future.  First of all, no cases
have emerged where TSKB thinks there is an actual risk of losses. Second-
ly, the initial review indicated that at the maximum, 25% of the foreign
exchange loans due for repayment in the next year or so might possibly
require some lengthening of repayment schedules to avoid a cash squeeze on
the borrowers. However, this is considered by TSKBts management as a very
conservative estimate, i.e. rescheduling to this degree is not expected. To
the extent that TSKB has to revise sub-project amortization schedules and
cannot pass on the revisions to its creditors, the company should have no
trouble since it is in a fairly liquid position. This is the result of
deliberate planning by TSKB in anticipation of a possible devaluation. In
summary, while TSKB should be in a position to weather the devaluation with-
out substantial problems, the devaluationts impact on TSKB's portfolio must
be kept under close review by TSKB and the Bank. With respect to TSKBIs
own debt/equity position, the company will remain in a sound position even
at the new exchange rate; the ratio remains within the existing limit.
(See para. 66.)



- 18 -
58.    TSKB has continued to make progress in dealing with its delinquent
accounts and they are now at reasonable levels (Annex 12). First, it has
reduced its loans in court from LT 43 million at the beginning of 1967 to
LT 17 million at the end of August 1970. Losses on the LT 26 million
settlements totalled only LT 2.5 million; all had been previously provided
for by provisions for losses. Second, at the end of August 1970, arrears
over three months totalled LT 15 million. The total principal outstanding
on these loans was LT 40 million or 2.5% of TSKB's loan portfolio. A review
of the real problem borrowing companies indicates that TSKB has been con-
servative in establishing provisions for loan losses totalling LT 15 million,
an opinion shared by TSKB's auditor, Arthur Andersen & Co. Provisions for
losses, as a percentage of portfolio, were 2.4% at the end of 1969. In fact,
in the past three years collections on loans for iwhich provision for losses
had been established actually exceeded write-offs out of provisions.  Exten-
sions of amortization schedules by TSKB are rarely done and thus problem
clients are not "hidden" by such action.
59.    TSKB has done well on its equity investments in recent years
(Annex 13). Dividend and capital gains income has averaged about 15% of
outstanding equities in the past three years. As of April 30, 1970, TSKB
had outstanding equity commitments to 32 firms totalling LT 136 million, of
which LT 123 million  had been disbursed.  However, an analysis of the
portfolio as of April 30, 1970, indicates that while its value is under-
stated on the balance sheet (particularly in view of provisions for possible
equity losses of LT 13.5 million), the proportion of very profitable com-
panies in the portfolio is somewhat reduced relative to previous years due to
sales in 1968 and 1969. However, appreciation in the value of the portfolio
will depend on the progress made by the projects still under construction,
which now account for one-third of TSKB's total equities.

IV. TSKB's FUTURE
60.    Looking at the coming decade in broad terms, TSKB's management
would like to see a shift in the company's orientation away from the direct
lending approach, a job which it has done relatively we1l in the past, to
an institution that is more of a "brokertt between people and institutions
that have funds, and Turkish industry. TSKB's management realizes that
for its long-term future it cannot indefinitely rely on the Government or
international aid-giving institutions. Its exploration into the bond market
represents a step in this direction. However, TSKB's development along
these lines is inextricably linked to Turkey as a whole achieving a more
viable and self-financing economy and it is not reasonable to expect that
in the near term the nature of TSKB's role will shift dramatically. Right
now Turkey and TSKB need resources and TSKB continues to perform a sound
role as an industrial lender, although it should be encouraged to develop
its talents and role as a broker between funds and projects.
TSKB's Operational Forecast and Resource Requirements
61.    During 1966-1969, private fixed investment doubled, from LT 1.6
billion in 1966 to LT 3.2 billion in 1969. TSKB's contribution was 15%
in 1966, but due to the lack of resources cited earlier, TSKB was unable
to sustain its contribution at this rate during the following years and
in 1969, its contribution in disbursements to the total private fixed
industrial investment dropped to 7%. In the next three years private
fixed industrial investment is expected to increase at the rate of about
25% a year, from LT 4 billion in 1970 to LT 6.3 billion in 1972, and it
would be unrealistic to project TSKB's potential lending volume merely in
terms of a percentage of the forecast private manufacturing investments
or even a scaled down version of the forecast. Barring an unforeseen
decline in investment activity, TSKB's future operations will continue to
be largely a function of the availability of resources.
62.    Resource Requirements.  Based on the applications already under studyl/
or to be received, its capacity to process them, and considering the realistic
availability of resources, TSKB should have no problem achieving the following
volume of operations in the next five years, if resources are available (in
millions of units - see Annex 14):
(in millions of units)

1/ TSKB has not encouraged applications recently because of its tight
resource position. Nevertheless, it has completed applications for
funds totalling US$h0 million in foreign exchange and LT 80 million
in local currency.



- 20 -
63.    With respect to 1970 forecasts, approvals as of June 30, 1970
amounted to US0$16.9 million in foreign exchange loans, LT 8.4 million in
local currency loans and LT 50 million in bond issues. The loan and equity
approvalsl/ scheduled for the balance of 1970 will just absorb TSKB's exist-
ing foreign and local resources.  (Taking into account equity sales in the
balance of the year and 1970 profits, but not loan collections in the last
half of the year.) For 1971 and 1972 TSKB is looking for about US$80 million
in foreign exchange and LT 330 million in local currency.
64.    Local Currency Sources.  The more or less firm sources for additional
local currency funds through 1972 are as follows:
Equity sales (1971/1972)         LT  63.0 million
Capital increase (1972)               27.5    i
Repayments (net) (May 1970-
December 1972)                    202.0    "
Retained earnings (1971/1972)          35    "
LT 33600 million
in addition, TSKB is hopeful in obtaining a counterpart loan of about LT 25
million in 1970 or early 1971 and it also expects to get about LT 10 million
in the next two years out of the total sales price of LT 25 million of its
present building. This will cover the local currency projected requirements.
65.     Forei4n Ctirrency Sources.  For the immediate future at least, the Kf'T
and the Bank appear to be TSKB's only potential sources for foreign exchange.
KfW lending to TSKB is more or less determined by the Government.  TSKB recent-
ly signed an agreement with KfW for Dgi 20 million and hopes to receive
similar loans in 1971 and 1972. This would mean that TSKB would receive
DM 60 million over the period concerned or about US$18 million equivalent.
In view of Th_key's further move toward association with the EEC, TSKB hopes
EIB funds will be available to it. This canmot be forecast with cormaplete
accuracy but TSKB might be in a position to obtain about US$7 million from
this source in 1972. If EIB funds materialize, on the basis of conservative
needs, TSKB's remaining foreign exchange gap for 1971/1972 is US$55 million.
The proposed Bank loan of US$40 million would cover the major part of this
remaininug gap but would still mean that TSKB would have to seek funds else-
where to fully cover its requirements. This matter wfas discussed at negotia-
tions and TS1KB has agreed to actively seek new sources of foreign exchange
credits over the coming two year period.
66.     Projected Financial Results.  Projected balance sheets through 1975
are shown n  Annex 15.,- On the basis of the projected volume of business,
TSKB's total assets would increase from about LT 1,888 million at the end
of 1970 to LT 3,877   million at the end of 1975.  The loan and equity
portfolio is estimated to increase from LT 1,560 million in 1970 to LT 3,453
million in 1975 and total long-term debt outstanding is expected to grow
from LT 1,616 million in 1970 to LT 3,339 million in 1975. The ratio of
1/ In TSKB's case the lag betwoeen approval and commitment is on average
only about four months and thus it plans its resource needs on an
approval basis.



- 21 -
total long-term debt (including the Government subordinated loan and guaranteed
bonds) to equity is projected to fluctuate between 7.5:1 and 8.6:1 during
1970-1975. The debt/equity ratio as defined in the Bank Loan Agreement rises
from 3.1:1 to the prescribed maximum of 4:1 at the end of 1973. (In calculat-
ing the ratio as defined in the Bank Loan Agreement, the maturities of the
Government subordinated loan due prior to the last maturity of the proposed
Bank loan are treated as debt.) Provisions for possible losses are estimated
to amount to LT 31.5 million at the end of 1972 and LT 42.5 million at the
end of 1975. As a percentage of TSKB's loan and equity portfolio the provi-
sion will be 1.6% in 1972 and 1.2% in 1975. If reserves are added to the
provisions, they will amount to LT 192.7 million or 10% of the total portfolio
at the end of 1972 and LT 367.6 million or 10.5% of the total portfolio at the
end of 1975.
67.     Projected cash flow statements for the years 1970 through 1975 are
given in Annex 17. (The basic assumptions for these forecasts are given in
Annexes 14 and 18. The estimated disbursement schedule for the Bank loan is
given in Annex 19.) These and the projected income statements show that the
debt service cover would be adequate during the forecast period. Annual
interest payments throughout the period range from 57% to 66% of TSKB's
annual profits before financial expenses. Principal repayments by TSKB range
from 42% to 79% of its annual collections. The overall debt service cover
will be 1.9 times in 1970, 1.6 times in 1971 and 1.5 times in 1972-1974.
Debt service cover beyond the period of the forecast would also remain satis-
factory. Principal repayments by TSKB in respect of the Government subordinat-
ed loan will start from 1981. Additional collections will adequately cover
the annual repayments thereafter. It is expected that the debt service cover
will not fall below 1.4 times by the time the proposed Bank loan is fully
repaid in 1987.
68.     Projected income statements for the years 1970 through 1975 are
included in Annex 16. TSKB's profits after tax are expected to grow from
LT 38.3 million in 1970 to LT 83.3 million in 1975 while the rate of return
on average net worth would fluctuate between 18.7% and 20.5% during the
period. TSKB has been getting a spread of 4-1/2% on the Government subor-
dinated loan and 29% to 2-1/2% on foreign exchange loans. In making the pro-
jections, the lending rates are assumed to range between 10.5% and 11.5%, but
TSKB's spreads on existing resources are forecast to remain the same.
Administrative costs are forecast to increase at an average rate of 10% per
annum, but would decline as a percentage of average total assets from 1.2% in
1970 to 0.8% in 1975. Estimated capital gains on shares to be sold by TSKB
out of its portfolio are included in the projections and additional provisions
for losses are included. TSKB proposes to increase its share capital by 25%
in 1972. Dividends on its ordinary shares are forecast to remain constant at,
12%. Taking into account the distribution to founders shares (5% of profits
remaining after a 10% allocation to reserves and a first dividend of 6%),
the pay-out ratio would decline from 39% in 1970 to 25% in 1975. (It is not
unlikely that during this time period TSKB might decide to issue additional
bonus shares.) On the basis of the projected dividend policy, the book value
of i. TSXB share will increase from 190% of par value at the end of 1970 to
335% at the end of 1975.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
69.    TSKB remains an important institution in Turkey for financing
private sector industrial activity. It has developed, over its 20-year
history, a diversified and competent appraisal staff. The company is
making efforts to improve its organization, internal coordination among
staff members responsible for project appraisal and its administrative
and accounting procedures. Outside consultants have been hired to advise
TSKB on these matters.
70.     TSKB s main problems relate to the general economic environment
in which it functions. Project appraisal is made difficult by the high
protection and distortion of market prices that exists in Turkey. TSKB is
making serious attempts to cut through these distortions to finance
projects that would be reasonably competitive under liberalized trading
conditions. Resource mobilization is also a difficult problem although
TSKB has begun to make a contribution in this area by substantial equity
sales and the guaranteeing of bond issues by its clients.  TSKB has agreed
to actively seek out those investment opportunities where exporting is feasible
and to develop as rapidly as possible its role as an intermediary in pri-
vate financial markets. Furthermore, the company has taken initiatives to
seek a wider geographic impact in its lending program and to reduce its
recent heavy concentration of small loans having marginal impact.
71.     TSKB's interest rates have represented a subsidy element in
industrial lending. TSKB has now raised its rates to conform to the
highest rates allowable under the new interest rate regime.
72.     In terms of its own financial performance, TSKB's record is good,
with the exception of somewhat inflated administrative costs. The company
is reasonably profitable and is now able to raise equity as needed to
finance its expansion.  Its own financial position, in terms of its liquid-
ity and debt/equity relationship, is conservatively maintained. While it
has arrears, TSKB has been prudent in establishing reserves to cover
possible losses. Its equity portfolio has been a source of significant
profits and its true value exceeds the cost at which it is carried on
TSKB's balance sheet.
73.    The major problem facing TSKB right now is finding resources to
maintain its operations. For local currency funds it will basically rely
on its internal cash generation plus the bonds it issues on behalf of its
clients.  The only realistic foreign exchange sources for TSKB, at present,
are the Bank, KfW, and perhaps in 1972, the EIB.  Assuming a foreign
exchange requirement of US$80 million for 1971 and 1972 and funds from
KfW and RIB totalling US$25 million, TSKB's remaining foreign exchange gap
would be US$55 million. The proposed US$40 million Bank loan would cover
the major part of this gap but would leave some incentive with TSKB for
mobilizing additional foreign exchange elsewhere.

74.    TSKB's present free limit (US$750,000 with an aggregate free limit
amounting to 30% of the loan) remains appropriate for the proposed loan in
view of the Bank's interest in monitoring the economic aspects of TSKB's
work. The existing debt limitation also remains a reasonable and prudent
limit.

INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BANK OF TURKEY
Statements of Policies
I.        Statement of Operational Policies Adopted in June 1950
1.        The Industrial Bank is a private institution which, though it will
consider the Government's plans for the national economy, will make decisions
on the basis of what is best for the health and activity of private enter-
prises.
2*        The factor of primary importance in the Industrial Bank is not its
financial resources but the technical services through which its financial
aid will be made effective.
3.        The Bank should have a first-class technical staff whose head and
nucleus must be sought abroad. It will make investments only after full
examination of applications by this staff.
4.        In selecting enterprises to be financed, the Bank wfill observe the
following criteria:
a. Production of goods of benefit to the Turkish economy;
b. Soundness of the enterprise;
c. Quick realization and profitableness of the enterprise; and
d. Desirability of geographical distribution of investment.
S,        The Bank will keep its interest rate as low as possible consistent
with the payment of its dividends and the accumulation of necessary reserves.
It may also charge a percentage of the profits of the financed enterprise in
return for the services of its technical staff.
6.        The Bank's financing may be in the form of loans, participations,
or both; the last is preferable in appropriate circumstances. Wherever
possible, the client should provide at least 50 per cent of his capital.
7.        The Bank will lend foreign exchange only for imports of equipment.
In order to make best use of its foreign exchange, it should seek, insofar
as possible, to apply for use of the Government's own foreign exchange re-
sources,
8.        The Bank will obtain adequate security on its loans; require the
keeping of adequate records and the use of sound accounting procedures; and
obtain rights of inspection and audit and, in the event of faulty management,
of intervention in the enterprises it finances.
9.        The Bank will seek to sell its participations to the widest public
and at the earliest moment practicable.

10.       The Bank will seek to interest foreign capital in investment in
Turkey.
11.       The Bank should use its influence in trying to improve government
administration relating to business so as to better the working conditions
and so the confidence of all private enterprise.
II.       Policy Resolution Adopted in March 1963 and Amended on October 28,
1966
1.        For the purpose of avoiding unnecessary duplications of investment
in the public and private sectors the Bank will keep regular and continuous
contact with the State Planning Organization through the Economic Research
Department.
2.        In order to ensure a widespread distribution of its investment
risks the Bank will follow the follow-ing policies:
(a) Not more than 15% of the Bank's equity and outstanding balance
at any time of the Government Loan, dated February 18, 1966, shall be commi-
tted to one single real person or corporate body for investment in the form
of a loan, capital participation or under any other form.
(b) No participation shall be taken in the capital of one single
company in an amount exceeding in the aggregate 5p of the Bank's equity and
outstanding balance at any time of the Government Loan, dated February 18,
1966.
(c) Tne Bank shall not-purchase the shares of any ccmpany corre-
sponding to more than 25% of its subscribed capital; provided, however, that
tbhe purchase of the shares corresponding to 50% of the shares already sub-
scribed for by the Bank in the event that the new shares to be issued by any
company cannot be sold when the Bank acts as an underwriter shall constitute
an exception to the provision of this paragraph.
(d) The total of the Bank's capital participations at cost price
shall not at any time exceed TL 175 million.
(e) The Bank will try to find partners such as IFC or similar in-
vestors to participate in the financing of large manufacturing projects to be
realized by private sector.
The provisions of b, c, and d, do not apply to shares received in
exhange for debit in a liquidation or reorganization or to conversion of
debt into shares necessary to protect the Bank's interests.
This resolution will not be amended wJithout the prior consent of
IDA.
3.        The economic criteria to be applied on investment loans is amended
as follows:
Priority shall be given to projects vhich:
(a) have a positive influence on the balance of payments oG Turkey,or



AiMNEX 4
Page 3
(b) have a high ratio or value added to investment, or
(c) promise reduction in costs and selling prices and-or improve-
ment in the quality of products, or
(d) are of importance from the standpoint of the realization of
the production targets set forth in the Development Plan.
III.      Policy Resolution adopted November 9, 1967 Amending the 1963 Re-
solution on Economic Criteria to be applied in Investigating
Applications for financing
1.        In order to avoid the creation of idle capacity in the economy and
hence, a waste of capital, priority be given to projects with high rates of
using the productive capacity.
2.        Efforts be made for ensuring a harmony with the annual programs of
the Development Plan in the outlines of the distribution of our resources
among the branches of industry.
3.        In the processing of the projects, the cost of the finished products
which would be calculated at the rate of exchange as applied by the State
Planning Organization in project evaluation be compared with the world prices
and priority be given to those projects which show an export potential, which
can survive without protective measures, and which can compete with the
linmUmE protection, respectively.
