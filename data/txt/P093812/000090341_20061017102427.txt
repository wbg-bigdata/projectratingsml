EUAccession-Shaping theAgendafor Development

1.      Romania expects to join the European Union in 2007, and consequently much o f the
Government's social and economic development policies are driven by this goal. Convergence
o f Romania's economy with that o f EUcountries i s seen as a top priority by the Government and
the population at large. EU accession will require wide ranging reforms o f the Romanian
economy in order to prepare for competition, and to improve the physical infrastructure. While
the Government has achieved significant progress in structural and institutional reform o f the
transport sector with support o f the World Bank, the state o f Romania's existing transport
infrastructure represents a key challenge for convergence and integration with EU member
states. The quality o froad and rail infrastructure i s limited, the efficiency and safety o f transport
services are below EU standards, and a large backlog in rehabilitation and maintenance has
accumulated mainly because Romania has underinvested in transport infrastructure in the past.
There i s an urgent need to speed up the improvement o f infrastructure quality and to rationalize
transport institutions. Substantial investments are needed to raise productivity, sustain growth
andto meet specific commitments under theAcquis Communautaires.

2.      These issues were identified inthe Government's transport sector strategy for 2003-2010
as well as in the National Development Plan. The Ministry o f Transport, Construction and
Tourism (MTCT) has developed a comprehensive medium-term investment program for the rail
and road sector to prepare for EU integration. The challenge for Romania i s prioritizing such
investments and securing the necessary funding without compromising the country's overall
fiscal and macroeconomic stability.

3.      Romania i s pursuing a balanced modernization approach between roads and railways: the
two dominant transport modes carrying more than 90 percent o f goods and passengers. Unlike
many countries in Eastern Europe, the railway sector has successfully kept pace with the
changing structure o f the Romanian economy and managed to keep a relatively high transport
market share. This was the result o f a long process o f railway reforms that started in the late
1990s and i s still continuing. Romania was indeed one o f the first countries in the E C A region
that radically reformed its railways. The Government's strategy is therefore to promote
productive investments in roads and railways that allow modal competition and enhanced
integrationwith the rest o f the EU.

Road Transport

4.      Roads are now the dominant mode o f transport inRomania providing some o f the lowest
freight rates when compared to EU countries. Road transport has gained market share at the
expense o f rail, and now carries about two thirds o f the combined road, rail, and waterway
freight market. This is particularly evident for short distance, high value, and time sensitive
cargo where road transport i s the preferred mode. In the passenger segment, road transport
aggressively competes with rail andnow dominates the intercity passenger transport market.



                                                  1

5.      Romania has an extensive road network o f some 78,000 kilometers o f public roads with
an additional 53,000 kilometers o f village and farm or forest roads. However, the main concern
for road users is the quality o f the road infrastructure. Over 30 percent o f Romania's national
roads are inpoor condition. This situation is partly due to the lack of adequate maintenance and
also partly due to poor construction quality. The road network was designed with bearing
capacities well below EUrequirements leading to restrictions on axle loads along some roads - a
concern for domestic and European truck operators. Road infrastructure capacity is also
becoming an issue on some road sections particularly around urban centers and through small
towns and villages, where the mix between local and transit traffic impedes the smooth flow o f
vehicles andis a cause o f severe congestion andpoor road safety.

6.      The Government o f Romania recognizes the weaknesses in the road network and its
impact on the competitiveness o f Romania's economy. In the EU Accession Treaty, the
Government has committed to completing the upgrade o f its main road network to EUstandards
by 2013, and consequently to remove the restrictions imposed on road freight. It has embarked
on an improvement plan for national roads.' On average, the Government's planwould amount
to some 3.65 percent o f GDP over the period 2007-2013, split between expenditures on
maintenance at 0.49percent o f GDP, and 2.52 percent o f GDP for capital investments in
motonvays and rehabilitation o f national roads. In addition, further funding i s required to
maintain county, local and urban roads.

7.      Funding to increase transport infrastructure capacity and, to a limited extent, network
rehabilitation along the Trans-European Corridors is available from EU pre- and post accession
grants (ISPA up to 2006, and the Cohesion Fundfrom 2007 onwards). It is estimated that grants
from the Cohesion Fund available for the road sector would amount to around 0.21 percent o f
GDP per year. Ongoing pre-accession as well as future European Regional Development Fund
(ERDF) grants would channel funds equivalent to some 0.08 percent o f GDP to the roads sector.
These EU grants would require a co-financing o f at least 0.05 percent o f GDP. The planned
investments in roads will require significant strengthening o f the planning and implementation
capacity o fthe roads administration as well as the capacity o f the construction industry.

8.      Institutional reforms o f the road sector inRomania have not followed the typical process
that other road organizations have gone through in Western Europe and in other developed
countries. In2003, from a "Regie Autonome" (an autonomous public works entity), the national
road administrator and manager (NAR) was transformed into a joint-stock compang in one
single step. The first audit o f RNCMNR as a commercial entity was carried out for CY2004. The
entity audit raised issues relating to the short and long term financial health o fthe company, and
internal financial management weaknesses. This is a consequence o f the current legal status o f
RNCMNR, established as a joint stock company subject to commercial company laws, and i s
also due to the lack o f clearly defined long term financing commensurate with the obligations o f
the RNCMNR. After receiving the CY2004 audit report, the M T C T made a commitment to
review and, if necessary, amend the legal status o f RNCMNR and the organizational structure.
This will also include a review o f the financing framework in order to ensure compliance with

` Road Strategy for the Development of the Transport Services during the Period 2005-2015. Government of

strengthen internal financial management ~apacity.~The required technical assistance will be
financed as part o f the on-going TRP, which already anticipated the need for such strengthening
o f RNCMNR capacity.

Railway Transport

9.       Although the railways have been losing market share to road transport, Romania i s one o f
the few countries inEastern Europe where timely and radical reforms implemented over the last
decade in the railway sector have laid the foundation for competitive rail transport, at least for
freight. Railway reform process takes time, and the Government is committed to completing the
reform agenda so as to make the railways more competitive.

10.      Romania's railway network comprises 10,781 route-km or 20,409 track-km o f railway
that is now managed by the National Railway Company CFR SA, a state-owned railway
infrastructure manager company,             There are two state-owned railway operating companies;
Marfa that operates freight services, and Calatori operates passenger services. The network
density in terms o f route-kilometer o f railway per inhabitant is slightly above that o f the EU-15
and EU-25 member states. However, the traffic density o f 2 million traffic unitshoute-km is
below 60 percent o f the average for EUcountries. Passenger services account for over one third
o f traffic (and over two thirds o f train-km). The three railway companies were created as part o f
the railway restructuring program that commenced in 1996 with significant support from the
World Bank. The railway reforms in Romania were designed along the principles set out in EU
directives to enforce competition within the enlarged EU. Private rail freight operators have
entered the market, and they handled about 17 percent o f rail freight in 2005 measured in terms
o f train-km, and 23 percent interms o f ton-km.

11.      Further reforms still need to be implemented to transform the railway companies into
fully commercial enterprises with minimum budget support. The improvements accomplished
over the period 1996-2005 have not offset the reduction in traffic volume over the same period.
In2005, the railways carried less than a halfo fthe traffic volume in 1995. The railway network,
the operations (particularly passenger services) and the business processes have not yet fully
adjusted to the reduced level o f traffic demand. The combination o f rising track access charges
and inadequate payments for Public Service Contracts (PSC) negatively impacted the financial
position o f Calatori, on which the Government contributions have increasingly been
concentrated. Both Calatori and CFR have also accumulated large arrears to the State run social
andpensionfunds.

12.      The M T C T has prepared a long-term strategy for the period 2006-20134 to ensure the
financial sustainability o f the railway companies, and to determine efficient levels o f investment
required to modernize the railway infrastructure. The main components o f this strategy aim to:
(i) strengthen Public Service Contracts for passenger services and corporate governance in the
railway companies; (ii)     develop new methodologies to determine Track Access Charges (TAC)

 Both financial performance and management issues were identified inthe 2004 entity audit report o f RNCMNR.
 Government Decision no. 817/2005 for the approval o f the Plan for long term strategy o f the railway sector for re-
establishing the financial balance o f the infrastructure manager and for the modernization and renewal o f the
infrastructure.

and passenger fares; (iii)increase the market responsiveness o f Calatori by dividing the
passenger railways into eight regional companies tailored to match market demand, with one
national passenger services company to handle long distance and international passenger traffic;
(iv) subject Marfa, the state-owned railway freight company, to competition by allowing private
operators o f freight services; (v) implement an efficiency improvement package consisting o f
network downsizing and further labor restructuring; (vi) extend the railway network that satisfies
EUinteroperability standards from 90 km in 2004 to 4,300 km in2015; and (vii) maintain the
market share o f freight transport at 25 percent by 2015 and that o f passenger transport at
35 percent.

13.     Underpinningthe Government's strategy is an expenditure plan that was drawn up by
MTCT, comprising four main components: (i)ensuring railway interoperability; (ii)
modernization and construction o f connection networks to the Trans-European Transport
Network (TEN-T); (iii)     modernization o f IT systems and inter-modality and; (iv) improved
railway traffic safety.

The challenge of EU accessionfor roads and railways

14.     EU accession will bring an important source o f finance for transport infrastructure.
Funding to increase transport infrastructure capacity and, to a limited extent, network
rehabilitation along the TEN-T is available from EU pre- and post accession grant funds. In
addition, the Government expects to use a part o f the grants available to Romania through the
ERDFfor the transport sector. The Sectoral OperationalProgram for Transport (SOPT) andthe
Regional Development Plans, estimate that Cohesion Funds for the transport sector would
provide around EUR 2.9 billion over the period 2007-2013, and will require some EUR 508
million co-financing by the Government (based on an average 15 percent o f eligible project
costs). ERDF would provide some EUR 1.1billion over the same period requiring some EUR
454 million of Government contribution. It i s expected that the road networks would receive one
halfo f these funds andthe railways one third.

15.     While EUaccession brings with it an opportunity to close the investment gap inthe road
andrailway sub-sectors, the efficient absorption o fthese funds remains a challenge for Romania.
The ongoing ISPA and PHARE programs, for instance, have suffered from severe
implementation problems. The two companies, RNCMNR and CFR, need to strengthen their
capacity to plan, and manage infrastructure investments. They need to reinforce their skills to
rigorously set priorities and to prepare realistic financing plans that fit within the overall medium
term expenditure framework (MTEF) definedby the Government.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement

16.     The proposed Transport Sector Support Project (TSSP) will help the Government
implement the roads and railways investment program through direct support for the roads and
railways Infrastructure Maintenance Program. The World Bank has actively supported the
transport sector inRomania through three investment operations and advisory services since the
mid-1980s (see Annex 2). The most recent Bank operation, the Transport Restructuring Project
(TRP) finances new road investments, the construction o f selected road bypasses and, for
railways, the procurement o f railway maintenance equipment to support CFR's mission as the


                                                   4

infrastructure manager. The TRP includes a significant institutional development component to
be achieved through a series o f technical assistance inputs as well as the provision o f
management information systems to improve the quality o f decision making for the management
o f both the railways and roads. In view o f the similarity o f the issues relating to financial
management capacity previously raised for the RNCMNR in the CY2004 audit reports, the
MTCT has decided that the technical assistance on building financial management capacity
should also benefit CFR. The project also includes a small component for institutional
development o f the capacity for planning andmanaging urbanpassenger transport. It is expected
that the technical assistance financed through the TRP will lead to: (i)an agreed policy
framework for the transport sector committing the Government to the required reforms; (ii)         a
sustainable expenditure framework agreed by the Government for the transport sector that i s
linked to the MTEF; and (iii)steps being taken to build the essential institutional capacity
required to implement the Government's transport infrastructure investment program inthe years
immediately after EUaccession.

17.     The institutional capacity components supported by the TRP focus on improving the
operation and data systems for road andrailway infrastructure, and strengthening o f the financial
management capacity o f both RNCMNR and CFR. This proposed project i s designed as a logical
complement to the TRP. The main physical component o f this project involves periodic
maintenance and rehabilitation o f existing road and rail networks by RNCMNR and CFR,
utilizing the management resources from the TRP.

18.     The need for Bank engagement in the transport sector in Romania remains strong.
Reforms inbothroads and railways sectors have made good progress, albeit slower thanplanned.
The essential framework for improved management and financing o f transport infrastructure in
Romania i s now taking shape, and this project should firmly establish this in the early years o f
EU membership.        This project has been developed to support both the management and
financing o f transport infrastructure inRomania. It is intended that the project will improve the
capacity of MTCT to absorb the significant amounts o f EUgrants that will be made available for
the transport sector in Romania. It i s also intended to complement the activities o f other major
international agencies active in Romania. The project is designed to substantially reduce the
backlog o f maintenance and ensure sufficient funding for rehabilitation during a period when a
significant portion o f the Government's resources will be usedto co-finance the EUgrants.

3. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

19.     The Bank's Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Romania covering the period 2006 -
2009 notes that "the overarching long term objective o f Romania i s to achieve convergence with
the EU. With a GDP per capita o f around 33 percent o f the EU-15 average, Romania has a large
unfinished development agenda." Consequently, the Government is committed to improving the
competitiveness o f the economy in order to be fully integrated inthe EUopen market within the
shortest possible timeframe.

20.     The CPS also notes that the mainissues facing the transport sector are the poor quality o f
infrastructure, inadequate financing o f maintenance and the need to complete the program o f
railway restructuring. Romania lacks high standard roads along the major trade corridors, and
has a road traffic injury rate that i s more than three times the EUaverage. The significant fall in


                                                    5

railway freight and passenger volumes requires rationalization o f the network and services, as
well improvements in labor productivity. Romania also needs a longer term strategy for the
railways to ensure the financial viability o f the railway companies and to modernize the
infrastructure and rolling stock. However, the underlying problem with both the rail and road
networks i s the large accumulated backlog o f maintenance that now requires significant
resources to rehabilitate the infrastructure.

B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

21.      The proposed USD 180million Specific Investment Loan (SIL) will finance a portion o f
Romania's 2006 - 2007 transport infrastructure investment program, particularly RNCMNR and
CFR's Infrastructure Maintenance Program. The national roads Infrastructure Maintenance
Program was developed by RNCMNR and includes periodic maintenance and current repairs o f
important national roads in 2006 and 2007. The railways Infrastructure Maintenance Program
was developed by CFR and includes maintenance, current and periodic repair and overhaul o f
interoperable' railway lines in 2006 and 2007. The project uses a Program-Based Approach
(PBA) to promote efficiency. Each year, the Bank andthe Government will agree on the specific
activities to be financed and included in the program for the following year. The Infkastructure
Maintenance Programs for national roads and railways i s estimated to cost USD 225 million,
including physical and price contingencies, evenly split between roads and railways. This
program is part o f a long term investment plan aimed at clearing the historical backlog o f
maintenance o f road and railway infrastructure. Implementing this program will improve
efficiency, productivity and service to users o f roads and railways. The project also includes
building capacity in both road and railway administration and management, and targeted
technical assistance. This will complement the extensive technical assistance component in the
ongoing Bank-supported Transport RestructuringProject.

22.      The MTEF prepared by the Government includes planned investments in the transport
sector that will increase over the period 2007 - 2013, reflecting the significant commitments
made in the Acquis Communautaires. The Government plans to finance this through a
combination o f EU grants, increased budget allocations, and sovereign debt including this Bank
loan. This project has been structured as a S I L that could be followed by one or two SILs in
future, depending on the Government's fiscal policy. This will support the five-year transport
infrastructure maintenance, rehabilitation and modernization program that has been designed to
improve the quality o f transport infrastructure and to address current concerns over inadequate
maintenance expenditure as expressed by the EUandother donors.

23.     The choice o f a Specific Investment Loan, with a possible series o f follow-up SILs, was
assessed to be the most appropriate for this type o f operation. An Adaptable Program Loan
(APL) was initially considered, but rejected, although it would have had the advantage of easy
linkage with policy reforms under the P A L and could have provided a strong reform incentive

for the Government. However, the Government did not want to commit to an extended loan at
the outset. Consequently, this project has been designed as a SIL operation covering periodic
maintenance o f roads and maintenance, repair and overhaul o f railways in 2006 and 2007, and
including technical assistance in 2006, 2007 and 2008, with retroactive financing for
expenditures incurred during2006 before the Loan signing date (subject to limits specified inthe
Loan Agreement). Future Bank loans could finance the remaining years o f the Government's
transport investmentprogram inthe 2007 -2013 period.

2. ProgramObjective andPhases

24.     This project is the first o f a possible series o f loans aimed at assisting the Government's
effort to improve the overall quality o f its national roads and railways networks during the first
years after EU accession. The project focuses on the Government's Infrastructure Maintenance
Program, which i s part o f a larger investment program, and includes measures to strengthen the
management capacity o f the road and railway infrastructure companies. The project i s designed
to assist the Government in setting priorities and to foster stable financing for maintenance o f
existing road and railway infrastructure. As indicated in the Country Partnership Strategy, the
World Bank would provide a maximum o f USD 750 million over the period 2006 - 2010,
including this proposedUSD 180million SIL that will cover 2006 - 2008.

25.     The Government's proposedplanfor the period 2007-2013 includes investments inroads
and railways infrastructure averaging EUR 2.5 billion and EUR 2 billion per year, respectively.
The Government i s in the process o f revising this investment program to fit within the overall
MTEF defined in the budget. The necessity to prioritize the program derives not only from
financial constraints, but also from the need for a more balanced expenditure program, which
better serves the development o f the private sector and which avoids peaks and troughs in the
investment program. The balanced program also permits gradual improvement in Romania's
absorptive capacity to utilize EUgrants.

3. Projectdevelopmentobjectiveandkey indicators

26.     The objective o f the proposed project i s to assist the Borrower to reduce transport costs
through the improvement o f the overall quality o f its national roads and railways networks
duringthe first years o f EUaccession. This will be achieved through a number o f actions:

        (0     For the roads sector:
               a.      Increasing the percentage o f national roads ingood condition.
               b.      Providing sustainable fbnding for road maintenance, rehabilitation, and
                       road safety, through a coherent multi-year rolling program.
               c.      Improving the capacity within the Romanian road administrations
                       (RNCMNR, `and others) to operate efficiently and effectively inmanaging
                       roadmaintenance and rehabilitation.
        (ii) Fortherailwayssector:
               a.      Decreasing the number o f hazard locations and the proportion o f sections
                       on the main lines subject to temporary speed restrictions, through repair

                           and rehabilitation o f track infrastructure and signaling and electrification
                           equipment.
                   b.      Providing sustainable funding for railway infrastructure maintenance,
                           current and periodic repair and overhaul, through a coherent multi-year
                           rolling program.
                    c.     Improving the capacity within the infrastructure railway company to
                           operate efficiently and effectively in managing railway maintenance and
                           rehabilitation.

   27.    Achievement o f the project objective to reduce transport user costs will be confirmed by
   regular monitoring o f road and railway quality indicators, as well as other performance
   indicators. Two output indicators will be measured to monitor overall progress: (i)          the total
   length o f roads receiving periodic maintenance (with a target o f 2,400 km receiving surface
   treatment by end 2006, and 450 km receiving overlay be end 2007), and (ii)          progress on the
   railway network rationalization. The table below specifies the project monitoring indicators,
   including the results expected at the end o f the project.

national roads, and maintenance, current and periodic repair and overhaul o f interoperable
railway lines in 2006 and 2007. This program was developed by RNCMNR, CFR, and MTCT,
with the support o f the Ministry o f Public Finance. The proposed project includes two
components for: (i) Road Sector Support; and (ii)  Railway Sector Support. For both components,
disbursement o f loan proceeds initially will be based on statement o f expenditures (SOEs), with
the possibility o f adopting a programmatic approach so that disbursements would based on
interim financial reports (LFRs).

29.     Component A: Road Sector Support, [USD 112.5 million, Loan USD 90.0 million]. This
component supports RNCMNR's Infrastructure Maintenance Program which includes periodic
maintenance and current repairs works on national roads, as well as technical assistance to
RNCMNR. The component covers:

        (i) Periodic       maintenance    and current     repairs  works     on   national  roads

               for the RNCMNR's Infrastructure Maintenance Program planned for 2006 and
               2007, which is part o f a larger national roads development program that covers
               the period up to 2013. Supporting this component ensures that there is an
               appropriate balance between expenditures on maintenance, reconstruction and
               development within the multi-year roadinvestment program.
        (ii)   Technical assistance for RNCMNR, [USD 3.0 million, Loan USD 2.4 million].
               This comprises studies and consulting services to be carried out in2006,2007 and
               2008 aimed at: (a) preparing and implementing a pilot o f output-based area-wide
               multi-year maintenance contracts, with the objective o f gradually expanding the
               coverage to the entire country within four years; (b) hiring a Technical Adviser to
               improve management and technical capacity within the RNCMNR; (c)
               conducting a first road user satisfaction survey; (d) training o f relevant staff
               within RNCMNR on the preparation, procurement and technicallfinancial

This component supports CFR's Infrastructure Maintenance Program which includes
maintenance, current and periodic repair and overhaul o f interoperable railway lines, and
technical assistance to CFR. The component covers:

        (i)    Maintenance, current and periodic repair, and overhaul works on interoperable
               lines, and supply o f necessary goods, [USD98.7 million, Loan USD 79.0 million].
               This comprises financial support for CFR's Infrastructure Maintenance Program
               for interoperable lines planned for 2006-2007. This program i s part o f CFR's

5. Lessonslearnedandreflectedin the projectdesign

31.     Preparation o f this project has benefited from the lessons learned during previous Bank-
financed projects inthe transport sector; the Railway RestructuringProject (Loan 3976-R0), the
Second Roads Project (Loan 4178-RO); and the ongoing Transport Restructuring Project (Loan
4757-RO). The Railways project, rated `highly satisfactory' by the Borrower in the ICR i s an
indication o f the value attached to the project outcomes. The key lessons learned from these
projects are that:




                                                     10

    0   The rapid growth o f the Romanian economy, and the drive to join the EU, has created
        higher than expected demands on transport facilities. From 2000 and 2004, transport o f
        goods carried by rail, road, or inland waterways has grown interms o f ton-kilometers at
        an average annual rate o f 15 percent, close to three times faster than the growth o f the
        economy which recorded an average annual growth rate in real terms o f 5.1 percent.
        Institutional development and sector financing have lagged behind. The ongoing TRP,
        and the PAL projects, have substantial institutional restructuring objectives; the current
        project, while complementing the institutional objectives, focuses on ensuring the
        investments. Bank supervisionneeds to help manage the process.

        Projects financed by the Bank constitute a small percentage o f the total investment inthe
        transport sector; less than 10percent inthe case o f Romania in 1996-2003. Although, the
        Bank's technical support is invaluable to the Borrower, coordination o f the various IFI-
        financed projects should always remain the responsibility of the Government.

    0   Projects need not be planned to the last minutiae. The implementing agencies should
        have the freedom to manage projects in order to achieve the development objectives
        within the resources made available to them. The present project seeks to use country
        systems to foster self reliance.

    0   The Romanian implementing agencies are competent inprocuring and implementing civil
        works.     Technical cooperation is needed in conceptualizing and implementing new
        management methods, training both management and staff, prioritizing projects within a
        hard budget constraint, and inupdating standards and regulations.

32.     The above lessons guided the project preparation activities, a large part o f them being
carried out and financed by the Borrower, including the identification o f project components,
project feasibility and design studies, and safeguards analyses. Investment priorities for the
transport sector were defined by the Borrower, and project components were selected from the
priority list preparedby Borrower.

33.     Finally, it i s pertinent to note that the legal framework, several safeguards requirements,
and financial management standards now applied inRomania are broadly inline with the Bank's
own requirements and standards. Project preparation was therefore carried out using the
Borrower's laws and requirements for certain safeguards and fiduciary standards. The Bank's
team reviewed Romania's systems for safeguards at an early stage to identify the areas o f key
differences with the Bank's requirements where additional inputs would be necessary for full
compliance with the Bank's own standards andprocedures.6

6. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

34.     The proposed operation has beentailored to respond to the Government's specific request
for Bank support inthe transport sector for activities that are not included within the scope o f EU
grant funds. Most o f the immediate needs are being addressed by loans from the Bank (Loan

4757-RO) and other IFIs (particularly EIB and EBRD), as well as from ISPA and the Cohesion
funds. Although the rehabilitation o fboth the road network andthe railway network are accorded
high priority, these have not received adequate funding. This project addresses road and rail
maintenance from three angles: (i)        it provides funding for the periodic maintenance o f important
roads and main railway lines; (ii)        it aims at creating a stable funding mechanism for road and
railway infrastructure maintenance; and (iii)          it seeks to close the remaining technical assistance
and management gaps by complementing the ambitious technical assistance program included
under the Transport Restructuring Loan and the PALS7

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnershiparrangements

35.       The MTCT will have overall responsibility for project oversight and coordination with
other IFIs, the EU(ISPA and Cohesion fund programs), bilateral agencies, and the private sector
partners. There i s an extensive technical assistance component in the Transport Restructuring
Project, in addition to those financed by the EU and other IFIs such as EBRD and EIB. These
technical assistance services are fully coordinated, and the Bank project team keeps in regular
contact with these entities to coordinate and cooperate both inlending andtechnical assistance.

36.       The road and railway components o f the project will be managed separately; the
RNCMNR will manage all the roads components, whilst the railways infrastructure company,
CFR, will manage all the railways components.

2. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements

37.       Project Management. The RNCMNR has well established departments or units that
perform specialized functions such as planning and development, road safety, maintenance
management, financial management, and a PPP unit. Consequently, the project will utilize
established procedures for procurement and financial management. The various departments and
unitswithinRNCMNRhaveprevious experience withmanagingIFI-financedprojects (including
the World Bank, EIB, EBRD, etc), and therefore the present administrative arrangements within
the organization will be maintained. Because o f recent management changes, the ongoing TRP
project provides technical assistance on reorganizing RNCMNR and managing it more
effectively.

38.       Management o f the railways components will be undertaken by CFR under the
supervision o f the General Directorate for Railways (GDR) within the MTCT. A Project
Management Unit (PMU) was established within GDR and seconded to CFR under the previous
Bank-financed project. The PMU has competent staff that has accumulated significant
experience with the fiduciary procedures andrequirements of IFIs.

'The   PAL3 project hadtwo core conditions for the transport sector: removal o fthe non-core railway track segments
from the CFR assets, and approval o f a revised schedule o f road user charges to cover 70% of all road costs
(excluding new investment). The latter was further linked to EU road user charge study, which unfortunately, has
failed; the result has beentermed `highly unsatisfactory' by the EU. It may be necessary to reactivate the Bank road
user charge study as initially planned.


                                                          12

39.     FinancialManagement. The significant strengths that will provide a basis for reliance
on the project's financial management systems include the experience o f the existing project
implementation teams. The IF1 projects unit within RNCMNR is currently in charge o f the
implementation o f the roads components o f the Transport Restructuring Project (TRP), and also
successfully implemented the Second Roads Project. The Project Management Unit within the
CFR i s currently in charge o f the implementation o f railways components of the TRP, and was
also in charge o f the successful implementation o f the Railway Rehabilitation Project. The
financial management capacity o f the two implementing entities and, inparticular their ability to
prepare financial statements in accordance with IFRS requirements, will also be strengthened
through specific technical assistance provided under the TRP. The existing project
implementation teams established within the RNCMNR and the CFR, will be responsible for the
financial management aspects o f the roads components, and o f the railways components,
respectively.

40.     The Project, to be implemented from 2006 to 2008, will have a Loan closing date of
December 31, 2008. Maintenance works will be implemented in 2006 and 2007, whereas
technical assistance activities will be carried out from 2006 - 2008. Supervision missions will
assess progress made, usingperformance indicators selected for the project.

3. Monitoringand evaluationof outcomeshesults

41.     For the road sector the indicators for the project's results will come from the road data
register that will be implemented under the TRP, which i s financing enhancements to the road
database, as well as capacity building activities for the RNCMNR staff. The TRP technical
assistance also includes the development o f performance indicators for the road sector.

42.     For the railways, the monitoring information is provided by the IRIS, and Oracle
Financials, both o f which are already in operation with trained personnel and used by the
management. The railway maintenance management system being developed under the ongoing
TRP will provide another stream o f information; the system development includes a training
component. In sum the data systems either exist or will be developed under the TRP and permit
comprehensive monitoring and evaluation o f project outputs in network context. As a backup,
should delays occur, the normal engineering supervision will provide project specific monitoring
and evaluation.

4. Sustainability

43.     The borrower has implemented past projects well and the results have been sustained.
Important to future sustainability is, however, the successful implementation o f the technical
assistance tasks in the ongoing TRP, whose satisfactory implementation progress i s a condition
to the success o f the present project. Inaddition, the project will seek sustainability for the roads
component by: (i)   developing and carrying out o f the 5-year road program for maintenance and
rehabilitation as formulated by RNCMNR with the assistance o f the road management and road
data systems under development within the TRP; (ii)       securing a stable and predictable funding
mechanism for the road sector under the MTEF approved by both the MPF and MTCT; (iii)
reorganizing RNCMNR maintenance functions to improve efficiency in implementing the road
sector expenditure program; and supporting a Technical Adviser consultant to advice on


                                                 13

implementing institutional restructuring required under this project and in the TRP. For the
railways, this will be achieved by: (i)supporting CFR in updating and implementing its 5-year
rolling Business Plan inclusive o f a 5-year maintenance program and business redesign action
plansderived from TRP technical assistance; (ii) providingtraining on procurement and financial
management for relevant staff in CFR; and (iii)  improving the overall financial position o f CFR
through reduced maintenance costs.

5. Critical risks and possible controversial aspects

44.    Risks. Inthe road sector, the proposed project is a moderate risk operation. RNCMNR
has implemented IF1funded projects and has an annual financing gap for its road maintenance
program. The main risk i s institutional. There has been a large turnover o f leadership and staff;
six Director Generals in five years and recent departure o f competent staff. Another risk that is
mitigated by the agreement inprinciple on the MTEF, is the availability of sufficient budgetary
funds for road maintenance and rehabilitation, and for counterpart funds for the ISPA projects.
Both risk factors will be mitigated through careful and timely assessment o f the 5-year road
program and the supporting MTEF, together with support from the IFIS,as well as close
monitoring o f the technical assistance activities, especially the road management and data
systems, and reorganization o f the maintenance function.


                                                                   Mitigation Measure

                                               14

45.     For the railways the three critical risks are: the lack o f management support to continue
railway restructuring along the agreed path; modernizing railway track maintenance principles;
and, making full use o f the management tools developed under the previous projects. The last
two issues are addressed through TRP technical assistance. Frequent and effective supervision
and cooperationwith the management are additional means to mitigate these risks.

46.     Controversial Aspects. There are no controversial issues foreseen to arise during the
implementation o f the project. The proposed project i s focused on road and railway infrastructure
maintenance and rehabilitation, and the environmental and social impacts are overwhelmingly
positive. There may be occasional discomfort when railway lines are closed to allow for major
overhauls and when more competition i s introduced to road maintenance. However, the
consequent better railway infrastructure, roads, better traffic safety, and private sector expansion
with attendant employment opportunities with higher pay scales will attenuate it. Public
participation events where the Government road programs have been presented, normally to
well-attended meetings, have recorded widespread public support for modernizing and
rehabilitating the roadnetwork.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic and financial analyses
Roads components

48.    RNCMNR has conducted cost-benefit analyses for the periodic maintenance o f road
sections to be included inthe first year o f the Infrastructure Maintenance Program. This program
covers some 2,600 kilometers o f national roads. The assessment has shown positive Net Present
Values (NPV), with a total NPV USD 165 million at a discount rate o f 12 percent. The
evaluation was done using the Highway Design and Maintenance model (HDM-111), which
simulates life cycle conditions and costs and provides economic decision criteria for road
construction andmaintenance activities.

Railways components

49.    CFR's proposed Infrastructure Maintenance Program to be supported by this project
spans over the period 2006-2010. The program focuses on interoperable railway lines that
provide EU interoperability on the Romanian railway network. The program includes


                                                  16

maintenance, current and periodic repair and overhaul o f track, switches and points, bridges,
tunnels, culverts, and modernization o f electrical and signaling systems. It is expected that
implementing this program will improve the current capacity by eliminating speed restrictions.

50.     The economic assessment o f the program assesses each line separately with economic
benefits derived from: (i)  direct savings on track maintenance; (ii) o f speed restrictions
                                                                           removal
leading to time savings for passengers, savings in freight costs due to better utilization ofwagons
and locomotives, and savings in train crew costs, The result o f the economic analysis shows
positive Net Present Values for the program o f all o f the lines included inCFR's program, with a
total NPV o f USD 173 million at 12 percent discount rate. Further details are provided in
Annex 9.

2. Financial analysis
Roads component

51.     RNCMNR transformation into ajoint-stock company subject to private company law has
brought out issues relating to the short and long term financial health o f the company and
internal financial management weaknesses.' Inaddition to the need to address these issues, it i s
also expected that EU accession will require some changes inthe financing o f the road sector in
Romania. In order to meet these challenges, the Government has developed an action plan
aiming to ensure compliance with EU Directive 2006/38/EC on road user charging systems, to
improve the short and long term financial health o f the company and to remedyinternal financial
management issues. This action plan is supported by technical assistance to be funded under the
on-going TW. The proposed loan will finance a portion o f RNCMNR's periodic maintenance
program. Historically, RNCMNR has financed administrative expenses, routine and periodic
maintenance, andrepair works usingcontributions from the State budget. This was supplemented
with proceeds from the Road Funduntil2002, when the Road Fundwas abolished and replaced
with a system o f Rovinieta. However, the transition period from the Road Fund until the full
introduction o f Rovinieta in2008 has left RNCMNR with a substantial financing gap. RNCMNR
has used short term loans to fill this gap. By 2008, Rovinieta rates will be set at the maximum
allowable by the EU bringing annual revenues to around EUR 280 million. Fuel excise taxes,
which are the main charge road users pay, are channeled directly to the State budget. In 2004,
only EUR 51 million from the budget was spent on national road maintenance and repairs, and
the State Budget contribution to national roads in2004 was EUR248 million out o ftotal national
roads expenditures o f EUR 721 million. Excise taxes on fuel used in the road sector were
estimated at around EUR 810 million in 2004. The average excise tax was EUR 0.26 per liter,
which i s at the lower end o f all EU25 countries. Romania has committed inthe Accession Treaty
to gradually increase these taxes after EU accession. Annex 9 provides a summary o f public
expenditures on national roads inRomania.

Railway component

52.     The financial profitability o f the project for CFR was assessed by discounting the
incremental cash-flow generated by the maintenance, repair and overhaul works included under
the railway component over the next 20 years at the World Bank loan interest rate, with and

 Bothfinancial performance andmanagement issues were identified inthe 2004 entity audit report o fRNCMNR.


                                                  17

without the project. The implementation o f improved maintenance practices and planningsystem
was estimated to reduce permanent way maintenance cost by 3 percent and labor costs by
2 percent annually over the period 2008-2009. The financial analysis indicates that the project i s
financially viable, with a financial internal rate o f return o f 13 percent and a positive net present
value (NPV) o f USD 68.6 million at a discount rate o f 6 percentg. The details o f the financial
analysis o f the project as well as a detailed analysis o f projected financial performance o f the
railway sector in Romania, including its fiscal impact on the Government budget, are presented
inAnnex 9.

3. Technical

53.     The design standards used for the periodic road maintenance and for the railway
infrastructure maintenance, repair, and overhaul to be financed under this project are based on
Romanian standards, which are compliant with existing European and international standards.
RNCMNR and CFR have good capacity in road and railway engineering and operations
respectively.   Both RNCMNR and CFR have long experience with the Bank, as they have
successhlly implemented several Bank-financed projects during the past decade. There should
therefore be no major technical issues for this project, other than to ensure that quality control i s
adequately administered both at the design and implementation stages.

4. Fiduciary

54.     Procurement. The procurement activities for the railways components will be carried out
by CFR. This central entity in Bucharest is staffed by very experienced staff with extensive
knowledge o f IF1programs as well as Bank procurement procedures. A training program in
procurement and other fiduciary and management activities, included in the procurement plan
after appraisal, should assist to further strengthen the capacity, including at the regional level
where track maintenance contracts could be procured. Procurement o f the roads components will
be undertaken by RNCMNR. A review o f the procurement capacity at pre-appraisal highlighted
the need to strengthen RNCMNR procurement capacity. The prior review thresholds set out in
the procurement plan, can be adjusted after a reassessment o f the procurement capacity made
during supervision missions. Prior review o f the first two National Competitive Bidding (NCB)
procedures for works (at least one for a CFR contract, one for a RNCMNR contract), and o f the
N C B contracts estimated to cost more than USD2 million will be used as a learning and training
exercise. A training program in procurement and other fiduciary and management activities is
also included inthe project and should assist to further strengthen the capacity, including at the
regional level. With capacity building, the other main goal o f the first year o f implementation
will be the review and harmonization o fNCBprocurementprocedures anddocuments acceptable
to the Bank, which is required after the passage o f the new Romanian Procurement Law. The
completion o f a mid-term assessment o f capacity building in procurement, may allow the
revision o f the thresholds, more particularly for the main components including maintenance and
repair works.

55.     The key issues and risks concerning procurement for implementation o f the project have
been identified and include staff turnover resulting from low civil service remuneration, and the

general country procurement climate and capacity".            The corrective measures that are required
have been discussed with MTCT, RNCMNR and CFR. The Bank has been informed that the
government has approved changes to the remuneration o f M T C T staff working on IF1projects to
align this with those o f staff working on EUprojects, but this was yet to be implemented at the
time o f Appraisal. The implementation o f a training program inBank-financed procurement and
financial management is also included inthe ongoing Transport Restructuring Project and will be
useful inbuildingcapacity inthe sub-sector before effectiveness o f this Loan.

56.     Financial Management. The financial management arrangements o f the project are
acceptable to the Bank. The overall financial management risk for the project i s moderate.

57.       However, as of the date o f this report, the Borrower i s not in compliance with the audit
covenants for the Second Roads Project (Loan 4178-RO) and for the Transport Restructuring
Project (Loan 4757-RO). These covenants require submission to the Bank o f the audited C Y
2005 Financial Statements for both RNCMNR and CFR, which were due on June 30, 2006, but
had not yet been received. According to the action plan agreed with the MTCT, both entities
will submit their CY2005 audit reports by May 31,2007. A waiver o f Bank Operational Policy
OP 10.02 was therefore approved by Bank Management, regarding the delay by RNCMNR and
CFR to submit the audited C Y 2005 Financial Statements.

58.      The first Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for Romania was
finalized in December 2003 and concluded that the overall fiduciary risk associated with the
public financial management and financial accountability arrangements o f the Romanian
Government administration i s considered to be moderate, with the systems for accounting,
financial reporting and internal control representing the areas with the higher risks and
budgeting, cash management and external audit and Parliamentary oversight representing the
lower risks.

59.      The implications o fthe CFAA for the project are addressed bythe following actions:

         0      A detailed review o f the systems was performed for each project implementing
                entity.
         0      Eachproject implementing entity has a distinct project-specific accounting ledger.
         0      Project accounting staff has been nominated for each project implementing entity.
         0      The format o f the Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) was agreed with both project
                implementing entities.
         0      RNCMNR and CFR entities' as well as Transport Sector Support Project financial
                statements will be auditedby an independent auditor annually.

60.     The project will rely to the extent possible on several elements o f institutional financial
management country systems, as follows:

        0       Staffing: the project staff will be employees o f RNCMNR and CFR.
        0       Internal control: the project will use the existing internal control mechanisms
                within the project implementing agencies.

        e       Flow o f funds: the Project will use the Treasury to the extent possible.
        e       Accounting and reporting: the Project will rely on the existing systems within
                RNCMNR and CFR.
        e       Internal audit: the Project will increasinglyrely on internal audit departments.
        e       External audit: the Romanian Supreme Audit Institution, the Court o f Accounts
                will perform anoperationalreview the Project.

61.     DisbursementArrangements. Bank funds will be disbursed either as direct payments,
or to the two designated accounts opened by each entity, which will be initially replenished
under the transactional disbursement procedures.         Subsequently, the Borrower may elect to
change to report-based disbursement procedures, which will require withdrawal applications to
be accompanied by quarterly un-audited interim financial reports (IFRs).                  Supporting
documentation for all transactions, including completion reports, goods received notes and
acceptance certificates, will be retained by the implementing entities and made available to the
Bank during project supervision. Retroactive financing o f eligible project expenditures from
January 1, 2006 until the expected date o f signing o f the Loan Agreement will be allowed up to
an aggregate amount o f USD 36 million.

62.     Reporting and Monitoring. Quarterly interim financial reports (IFRs) will be used
initially for project monitoring and supervision and subsequently, once the Borrower elects to
change to report based disbursement, IFRs will be used for disbursement purposes and project
monitoring and supervision.       The project implementing teams in RNCMNR and CFR will
produce the project's IFRs every calendar quarter and the reports will be submitted to the Bank.
Formats of IFRswere attached to the minutes o f negotiations.

5. Social

63.     Poverty Category. The loan i s not a poverty-focused operation. However, it supports the
Government's road sector policy o f broad, evenly distributed benefits and promotion o f
economic growth, and improved road safety. Improved transport facilities provide access to
schools, health and job markets, especially in rural Romania. Road and railway works also
generate substantial employment. While this impact may be temporary, the proposed loan will
help facilitate stable and sustained funding for the roads, which fosters the development o f
private sector industries andprovides for sustained employment inthe sector.

64.     Participatory EZements. Preparation o f the project took place during a time when severe
floods had impaired both road and railway services. There was a public debate on the condition
o f the Romanian transport network. The Government has been involved in explaining the sector
objectives to the public.

65.     Public Information. A successful implementation o f the project and the sector
restructuring will require public andpolitical support. To this end, the Government i s encouraged
to establish a broadpublic information andparticipation program to inform the public o f the new
transport sector organization, the proposedroad andrailway program, and to seek comments and
feedback from the public on an annual basis.

6. Environment

66.     The proposed loan will support the rehabilitation and modernization o f the railways and
the national roads, and their administration, management, and financing. As a Sector Investment
Loan, it has beenrated a Category B project during the project safeguards consultation meeting.
The loan supports investments which are appraised on a network rather than case by case basis.
To ensure that the project will not negatively impact the environment, due diligence will be
carried out for each subproject. A description o f the proposed project has been prepared and
made available to the public.

7. Safeguardpolicies

67.     Equivalence and AcceptabilityAssessments: This project was selected for piloting the
use o f country systems under the Bank's OPiBP 4.00. Thus a safeguards diagnostic study was
undertaken to assess (a) the equivalence o f Romanian systems and World Bank requirements,
and (b) the acceptability o f implementation practices, track record and capacity o f the agencies
involved",      The review covered the area o f Environmental Assessment, and Involuntary
Resettlement. Under the Bank's policy on Environmental Assessment, the project could be
categorized as an environmental category B since the investmentswill have no significant impact
on the environment. The policy area o f involuntary resettlement was included to cover the event
that landacquisition may be needed.

68.     The equivalence and acceptability assessment was carried out by an interdisciplinary
team o f Bank staff in collaboration with relevant Government staff. The World Bank review
included meetings and site visits in cooperation with environmental officials at the local and
regional levels. The methodology included desk review o f current in force legislation and
supporting mandatory guidelines, discussion with Government officials and other relevant
environmental authorities, as well as field visits invarious parts o f Romania. The results o f the
diagnostic review indicate that the operational principles o f Environmental Assessment as stated
in Table A1 of OP 4.00 and the Romanian EL4 system have many common features and that
there are no gaps in equivalency. With respect to the acceptability, it was also found that
Romania's current approach to EL4 conforms to OP 4.00. With regard to Involuntary
Resettlement, the diagnostic review found several differences between Romania's system
pertaining to land expropriation and the operational principles on Involuntary Resettlement as
stated in Table A1 o f OP 4.00. Consequently, it was later decided not to include Involuntary
Resettlement as a pilot for use o f country systems and to revert to the World Bank operational
policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OPBP 4.12). At the time o f appraisal, it became clear that
the list o f road and rail sections to be financed under this project did not require any land
acquisition, and therefore OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement was not triggered.

69.     World Bank supervision on safeguard-related matters will continue throughout the
implementation o f the proposed project to: (i)ensure compliance with "equivalent and
acceptable" Romanian procedures, (ii) compliance with Bankpolicies if7where they apply
                                        ensure

70.      PublicConsultationandDisclosure: Staff from the Ministryo fEnvironment andWater
Management (MEWM) and the World Bankjointly organized a public consultation workshop to
discuss the draft version o f the Equivalence and Acceptability Report inBucharest inDecember
2005. The MEWMhad circulated copies o f the Executive Summary o f the draft report to a large
number individuals and relevant agencies inviting for their participation and comments. Over
thirty-five people, representing NGOs, EA consultants, academia, and various Government
departments, attended this workshop. Participants expressed their support to the proposal to pilot
Romanian Environmental and Social systems in the context o f the project and agreed with the
findings and gap filling actions proposed to achieve and sustain equivalence and acceptability.
The full report including the executive summary discussed during the workshop was disclosed in
Romania and inWashington on January 25,2006.

71,      Land AcquisitionResettIement Policy Framework. As indicated, at the time o f
Appraisal it was determined that OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement is not triggered. However,
it was recognized that duringproject implementation, safety concerns may require straightening
o f some road or rail sections and that such action could require land acquisition an&or
involuntary resettlement. Should such a situation arise, the Land Acquisition / Resettlement
Policy Framework prepared by RNCMNR, and approved by the Bank for the Transport
Restructuring Project (Loan 4757-RO) will be adapted for use in this project.     Inthe event of
any land acquisition or involuntary resettlement, an updated version o f the LandAcquisition /
Resettlement Policy Framework, to be satisfactory to the Bank, will be prepared and disclosed
for a minimum o f 60 days prior to the start o f any land acquisition process. In addition, an
Information Brochure for affected land owners will be prepared and made available in advance
to potentially affected persons outlining the expropriation process in accordance with OP 4.12
provisions and the applicable RomanianLaws.

72.      The safeguards policies triggered by the project are as follows:

8. Policy Exceptions and Readiness

74.     The project requires one exception to Bank policy regarding submission of audits. The
Borrower i s not in compliance with the audit covenants for the Second Roads Project (Loan
4178-RO) and for the Transport Restructuring Project (Loan 4757-RO) as previously described
in paragraph 57. A waiver of Bank Operational Policy OP 10.02 was approved by Bank
Management, regarding the delay by the two implementing entities to submit audited Financial
Statements for CY2005.

75.     Theproject meets the regional criteria for readinessfor implementation.

                  ROMANIA: TRANSPORT SECTORSUPPORT PROJECT


The RomanianEconomy
Romania i s classified as a lower middle income country with GNI per capita o f USD 2,940 and
population o f some 22 million. It is the second largest country in Central and Eastern Europe,
and i s largerthan 10 o f the 15 current members o f the EuropeanUnion.

The country i s in the process o f comprehensive restructuring o f its economy with a view to
joining the EU in 2007. Romania's transition, began in 1990, has not been easy. In order to
minimize the social costs o f transition, the Government initially hesitated to impose tight fiscal
constraints and privatization o f large, loss-making State-Owned Enterprises. Attempts to impose
macroeconomic stability without restructuring support led to negative economic growth and
poverty increased.

Economic growth has returned in the past three, four years, but important challenges remain.
Structural reforms are needed to builda competitive market economy for EUintegration. Poverty
remains widespread with some 25 percent o f the population living below the poverty line. About
60 percent o f the poor live inrural areas despite the country's substantial potential in agriculture,
forestry and fisheries.

Starting in 2000, the Government implemented macroeconomic policies which were supportive
o f growth. A disciplined fiscal policy, complemented by a tight monetary policy and augmented
with structural reforms, led to improved financial discipline in the enterprise sector and placed
public finances and the financial system on a firmer footing.

This resulted in robust GDP growth for two consecutive years: 4.9 in 2003 and 8.3 in 2004. In
addition, inflation and interest rates declined, the fiscal deficit was brought under (temporary)
control, and the external balance was comfortable. Romania became an attractive destination for
international investors with better sovereign ratings and improved access to international capital
markets.    Change in Government in 2005, and consequent changes in economic policies is
bringing-and has brought-a          measure o f uncertainty. However, it is expected that favorable
economic development will continue inRomania.

As a result o f the sustained growth, road freight traffic increased markedly. In 200412, roads,
railways and inlandwaterways handled 64, 29 and 7 percent o f freight respectively in terms o f
ton-km.. Truck transportation i s expected to grow faster than the economy. Road traffic growth
also comes from increased vehicle ownership. There were 4 million registered motor vehicles,
including 3.2 million cars in 2004. The average annual growth rate in fleet size is about
4.5 percent. Vehicle ownership is presently 136 cars per 1,000 inhabitants, still much less than
most o f the EU. It i s expected that there will be rapid growth in car ownership and personal
travel. Intercity bus travel, an economic and highly competitive mode, will also continue to grow
and win market share from rail passenger services. Road traffic has indeed grown rapidly; the

annual traffic growth has been about 7percent between 2000 and 2005. In 2004, the modal
shares passenger-kilometers o f private cars, public road transport, and railways were 75, 13, and
12percent respectively.


The RoadNetwork, ItsAdministrationandManagement
Romania's public road network totals about 78,800 km. They are classified in a three-tier
system: national (arterial) roads (15,000 km), county (collector) roads (app. 36,000 km), and
communal (local) roads (app. 27,800 km). Inaddition there are some 22,000 km o f city streets,
and 30,000 km village roads serving farming related activities. The national roads are
administered and managed by the Romania National Company for Motorways and National
Roads (RNCMNR) - an entity under the Ministry o f Transport, Construction and Tourism. The
county roads are administered by the County Council and managed by the county's Technical
Department. The communal roads are administered and managed by the community councils
aided by the County's technical office. This administrative framework is shown intable 1.

There are four road sector actors: owner, administrator, manager, and supplier.         These are
defined as follows for Romania.

       Owner: Entityresponsible for funding, roadpolicies and the legal framework.
       InRomania, the state defines theroadsector laws andfunding arrangements. The MTCT
       is the owner o f the national network. It i s financed through the state budget and through
       user charges such as the Rovinieta. The counties own and fund the county (collector)
       roads, and the communities own the local roads. They also set the policies for their road
       networks. The state provides no funding for the county and communal roads.

       Administrator: Entityresponsible for approving the roadprogram, paying the contractors
       and ensuring that the performance o f the road network meets the political aims o f the
       owner.     In Romania, the administrator for the national roads is RNCMNR.             The
       administrator o f the county roads i s the County Technical Department.

       Manager:      Entity responsible for developing the road program, which meets the
       objectives and the budget, for approval by the Administrator. Manager specifies the
       activities to be carried out, supervises them, and approves payments to the contractors. In
       Romania, for the national (arterial) roads, the manager role is combined with that o f the
       administrator:    RNCMNR headquarters manage the construction and all IF1 funded
       programs on the arterial roads.      The RNCMNR regional offices manage the routine
       maintenance and some periodic maintenance works on the arterial roads. For the other
       functional classes, the manager in Romania i s the County Technical Department, or, in
       many cases, the county's (corporatized) construction organization, (SCDP or DJDP).

       Supplier:    Entity responsible for delivery o f design, construction, and maintenance
       services to the Administrator, selected, supervised and managed by the Manager. In
       Romania the national network supplier i s the private sector, except for routine
       maintenance.     The supplier for the lower class networks is, normally, the county's
       corporatizedconstruction organizations, often on sole source basis.

Institutional reforms for the road sector in Romania have not followed the typical process that
other road organizations have gone through inWestern Europe and inother developed countries
(notably Sweden, Finland, UK, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Chile, etc.). In
2003, from a "Regie Autonome" (Le. an autonomous public works entity), the road administrator
and manager was transformed into a joint-stock c ~ m p a n y ' ~         in one single step. The
transformation o f road agencies in other countries involved a five stage process, (i)   traditional
Roads or Public Works Department within a parent ministry (such as the previous Roads
Division in the former Ministry o f Transport, Public Works and Housing in Romania), (ii)
separation o f client and supplier h c t i o n s (this phase i s now taking place in Romania), (iii)
separation o f client and supplier organizations, (iv) Corporatizatioflrivatization o f the supplier
organization (v) Corporatization o f the client organization. Romania went straight from Phase 2
into Phase 5, without going through the development and learning processes that are necessary
for both the road organization andthe parent ministry.

Such leapfrogging has proved unsustainable in Romania. The first audit o f RNCMNR as a
commercial entity carried out for CY2004, brought out issues relating to the short and long term
financial health o f the company and internal financial management weaknesses. In order to
address these issues, the M T C T has started a fundamental review o f the legal status,
organizational structure and financial position o f the RNCMNR, andthis will include:
    (1) Internal review o f RNCMNR structure, legal status and financial position, taking into
         account EUDirective 2006/38/EC and preparation o f viable options for future reform o f
         RNCMNR.
    (2) Decision on the new structure for RNCMNR, ifnecessary, to be processed inaccordance
         with Romanianlaws and establishment o fthe new organizationstructure.
    (3) Implementation o f the new organization structure, creation o f the new legal entity and
         financing instruments to ensure longterm sustainability.

In addition, the financial management capacity and procedures o f the RNCMNR will be
strengthened through a Technical Assistance part o f the on-going TRP.

Road transport services are privatized and offered by numerous buses and trucks operated either
by their owners or bus and trucking companies. The issue o f road safety has moving inexorably

up the policy agenda, reflectingthe seriousness andthe significance o fthe issue, at bothpersonal
and national level. Road traffic accidents fatalities reached 2,301 and 2,491 in 2004 and 2005
respectively, o f which some 1,000 are on national roads. A Global Road Safety Partnership
(GRSP) program has been active in conjunction o f the Bank's road projects to contribute to the
development o f all aspects o f road traffic safety. Crash reductions in black spot locations
improved inthe Second Roads project are impressive. The intention i s to continue this successful
cooperation.

Financing o f the main roads i s arranged through the state budget, a dedicated vignette, called
Rovinieta, and loans and grants. Over the past decade RNCMNR has secured grants (EU-ISPA)
and several loans from International Financial Institutions (the World Bank, EIB, EBRD) to
upgrade its main road corridors. The Government is actively pursuing new external IF1financing
or Public Private Partnerships to upgrade the main roads. A large part o f the RNCMNR multi-
year highway program i s funded through loans and grants. The county and communal roads are
funded, if at all, through their own budgets, although EU-SAPARD and World Bank's Rural
Development Project have begunto provide limited funding for these.14

Road capacity and, especially, the quality o f this capacity must be increased to meet the
anticipated traffic demand. The old roads in Romania have no functional distinction between
serving land access and traffic; most roads have direct access to land, and pass through villages,
towns and cities. The rehabilitation o f main roads i s necessarily a stop-gap measure for the
primary arterials (E-Roads and Main National Roads), but relevant for the Secondary National
Roads. The by-passes which are funded incurrent TRP project serve traffic and provide no direct
access to land. Inthis way, the road capacity and its quality are improved. As a by-product, road
traffic safety is improved and the urban city-often richly historic-is           preserved. Attendant to
the physicalworks, road management i s improved through targeted technical assistance.

The Railways

The issues at the railways are more diffused, but the core objective is the same: tailor the
capacity to meet market demand, reorganize the railways to take advantage o f newly acquired
information tools, andretrain the management to manage and runthe railways commercially.

The Romanian Railways have achieved significant progress in structural reform under the
umbrella o f the previous World Bank financed Railway Rehabilitation Project (Loan 3976-R0),
with co-financing from EBRDandEU-PHARE,inparticular regardinglabor, organizational, and
financial restructuring, and privatization o f non-core railway businesses. The railways have: (a)
reduced staff and increased staff productivity, despite declining traffic; (b) unbundled the
integrated railway system into three separate companies; (c) issued license to private operators;
(d) set up appropriate mechanism to relieve the railway o f historic debt; (e) provided PSO
compensation for uneconomic passenger lines and services; (f) made long-term planningthrough
5-year Business Plans an integral part o f its business culture; (g) invested inasset modernization


l4 GovernmentissuedaPolicyLetterfortheroadsectorin2003aspartoftheEBRDloan.Thisincludes, inter
   The
alia, a study to modernize the road fbnd and road financing inRomania. However, the Government abolished the
Road Fund in 2004, with negative consequences on the financing o f main roads and practically eliminated all
domestic funding o fthe county roads.

and rehabilitation plan, which should lead to improved productivity and safety in the coming
years; and (h) separated and privatized non-core railway businesses. Recent trends in the key
operational and financial indicators are given in Annex 9. While much has been accomplished,
much remains to be done to transform the railways into a filly commercial enterprise with
minimumbudget support. An important part o f the transformation is to improve the physical
infrastructure: remove speed restrictions and safety hazards on the interoperablenetwork.

The state contribution and the railways' uncovered financial deficit amount to about 0.6 percent
o f GDP in 2005. The Government is committed to deeper reforms to continue to improve
financial performance o f the railways and reduce financial deficit and fiscal burden, deriving
from undesirable legacies o f the past. All railway systems in Western Europe receive
Government financial support rangingfrom 0.2 percent (UK) to 0.6 percent o f GDP (France) by
one mechanism or another to sustain their railway networks. The challenge for Romania i s to
sustain a railway network o f much the same density as Western Europe with about 60 percent o f
the traffic density, about half the labor productivity and with a tenth o f the Gross National
Incomekapita. The upshot from the numbers i s that deeper actions are required to reduce the
fiscal burdeno f the railways on the state budget.


Detailed development objectives of the project

The project will continue to support the objectives the Bank has supported in Romania in the
past, appropriately adjusted and modified to the current stage o f development to be fit for
purpose. The project's development objective i s to assist the Borrower to reduce transport costs
through the improvement o f the overall quality o f its national roads and railways networks
duringthe first years o f EU accession. This will be achieved through secondary objectives for
roads andrailways.


The roads sector
m:Increase      the percentage o f national roads ingood condition.

m:Provide        sustainable fimding for road maintenance, rehabilitation, and road safety, through
a coherent multi-year rolling program.
The project will serve to close the funding gap in road rehabilitation and maintenance o f the
main roads. At the same time, the Bank will work with the Government to establish a reliable
and sustainable funding basis for maintenance, rehabilitation, and safety o f the national roads.
This effort will rest on two bases: the Road User Charge (RUC) study and the Road Data
Register." The PHARE funded RUC failed to establish a reliable basis for road user charges.
m:Improve         the capacity within the road administration (RNCMNR) to operate efficiently and
effectively inmanaging road maintenance and rehabilitation.
The ongoing TRP project has an ambitious technical cooperation program. The present project
will buildon that program. Experience and data suggest that road maintenance costs inRomania
are higher than in EU countries. For the national roads, the project will focus its technical
assistance to assist RNCMNR to move gradually its routine maintenance and periodic
maintenance o f rehabilitated roads to output or performance-based, multi-year contracts.


Therailways sector

The project aims to assist CFR to reduce transport costs through the improvement o f the overall
quality o f its interoperablenetwork during the first years o f EUaccession. This will be achieved
through the following secondary objectives.
m:Decrease         the number o f hazard locations and the proportion o f sections on the main lines
subject to temporary speed restrictions, through repair and rehabilitation o f track infrastructure
and signaling and electrification equipments.
The chronic lack o f maintenance works has led to the deterioration o f the quality and safety
parameters o f CFR railway infrastructure. From 1995 to 2005, the length o f tracks generating
speed restrictions has increased from 386 km to over 630           km16.   The number and total length o f
weakened track segments generating hazard points have increased from 930 and 480 km in 1992
to 1,060 and 550 km in2005 respectively. Bridges, footbridges and tunnels with expired lifetime
are increasingly generating speed restrictions and impose to lower the ranking o f lines in terms
o f average speed.

D02: Provide sustainable funding for railway infrastructure repair and rehabilitation, through a
coherent multi-year rollingprogram.
One o f the reasons for the lack o f maintenance i s the insufficient funding and the lack o f
medium-term maintenance strategy with clear prioritization o f maintenance works. The project
will serve to close the funding gap inrailway rehabilitation and maintenance o f the interoperable
network. At the same time, the Bank will work with CFR to develop multi-year maintenance
programs as part o f TRP technical assistance and update CFR multi-year Business Plan.

m:Improve         the capacity within the infrastructure railway company to operate efficiently and
effectively inmanagingrailway maintenance and rehabilitation.
Current maintenance practices do not make a full use o f available technologies such as IRIS
Infrastructure Management module, the track geometry car and Oracle Financials. As a result,
they tend to respond to day-to-day urgent needs on the network without monthly and yearly
planning. The project will allow the progressive implementation o f the new maintenance
business model to be designed inTRP.

The ultimate aim o f the DOs is improved, competitive and financially sound railway services in
Romania. Therefore, continued monitoring and technical advice, together with the activities in
the ongoing railway component under the TRP", will parallel the railway infrastructure and
network modernizationo fthis project.




17TRP comprises six key components: (a) reduction o f excess staff (about 20%); (b) reduction o f excess railway
track (3,500 km, or 35% o f total network); (c) restructuring o f Marfa's business processes; (d) implementation o f
track access charge scheme designed to improve Marfa's competitiveness; (e) involvement o f private sector in the
operation and management o f railways, particular in freight services, and developing international freight traffic on
main corridors; (f) refinement o f a clear PSC contract between the Government and the operating company to cover
only essential and affordable State obligations, and termination o f other services.

       Annex 2: Major RelatedProjectsFinancedby the Bank and/or other Agencies
                 ROMANIA: TRANSPORTSECTORSUPPORTPROJECT

The Bank has been active in Romania's transport sector for over a decade. Two projects have
been completed, the Transport project and the Railway Rehabilitation project; a third, the Second
Roads project, will close in six months.          There are two ongoing projects, the Transport
Restructuring project (TRP), effective since July 2005, and the Rural Development project
(RDP), effective since 08/01/2003, which has a significant rural local road component. OED
project performance assessment (PPAR and ICR) evaluated the outcome o f the completed
projects' outcomes as highlysignificant and their institutional development as high.

The still ongoing Second Roads project had an ambitious institutional development program to
be funded by PHARE, but that fell through and there was no funding for institutional
development. These institutional development issues will be addressed anew in the Transport
Restructuring project-this    time Bank financed. The traffic safety, lead reduction, and the civil
works components in the Second Roads project have been executed well. Using the savings in
the road works, the project added an urban road rehabilitation and traffic management
component-the     Baneasa- Otopeni segment o f National Road 1 (DN1). This heavily trafficked
road to the Bucharest airport involves multiple entities-Bucharest,    Otopeni municipality, Ilfov
county, the utility owners, land owners, and, o f course, the Road Administration-has         proven
most difficult to implement. This project component has experienced significant delays, but it is
being undertaken in difficult circumstances in many dimensions. Because traffic issues in and
near urban areas, both in the streets and the main roads, are predominant also in the future, the
lessons learned in implementing this difficult component will serve well most future road
projects, especially the city bypasses inthe TRP.                               1




Besides the road administration organization, financial management, road management system
and associated road and bridge data issues, and their use, which are being addressed inthe TRP
project, there remains the critical shortage o f funding for upgrading andrehabilitation o f the road
network and the entity's difficulties in hiring and retaining experienced staff, which was
accentuated by the recent departure o f professional staff. These circumstances apply both to
national and rural (collector and local) roads. The proposed project will provide funding for
upgrading and rehabilitating important national roads; develop concurrently capacity in road
administration and regional road management entities; and to bring about a sustainable road
financing system (using project technical assistance, unless the PHAREl funded consultancy,
beingtermed `highly unsatisfactory' bythe sponsor, is rectified).

For the railways, the key issues are similar: provide financing to upgrade and rehabilitate key
segments o f interoperable European Corridors IV and IX; develop management capacity in the
railway companies with aim to base it on professional merits and reserve the political guidance
to be applied through the companies' supervisory boards; and, based on the passenger market
study, continue work on tailoring the PSC to the passenger traffic demand.

Both components, road and rail, will be consistent with the Government's medium term
expenditure framework for the transport sector.

                ROMANIA: TRANSPORT SECTORSUPPORT PROJECT


The proposed loan o f U S D 180million will contribute to financing the Infrastructure
Maintenance Program o f national roads and railways which covers 2006 and 2007.               This
program i s estimated to cost USD 225.0 million, including physical and price contingencies.
The program includes periodic maintenance and current repairs for national roads and
maintenance, current and periodic repair and overhaul for railway infrastructure. This program
was developed by RNCMNR, CFR, and MTCT, with the support o f the Ministry o f Public
Finance. The proposed project includes two components: (i)          Road Sector Support; and (ii)
Railway Sector Support.

Component A: Road Sector Support, [USD 112.5 million, Loan USD90.0 million].                  This
component supports RNCMNR's Infrastructure Maintenance Program which covers 2006 and
2007 and includes periodic maintenance and current repairs works on national roads, as well as
technical assistance to RNCMNR in 2006 - 2008. The Technical Assistance i s aimed at
modernizing RNCMNR's maintenance practices. This component is based on projected
maintenance needs o f the national roads not financed from other sources, and the economic and
financial analyses. Inthe past few years, RNCMNR's own revenues and contributions from the
state budget have fallen far short o f the needs to finance RNCMNR's administrative expenses,
routine and periodic maintenance, and repair works.       RNCMNR has been using short term
commercial loans to finance periodic maintenance and repair works. RNCMNR can no more
rely on these expensive short term commercial loans. However, until the introduction o f the
Rovinieta charge i s fully completed in 2008, and these commercial loans are hlly paid off,
RNCMNR will need additional funds to fully implement its maintenance program. Furthermore,
the PAL conditionality, backed up by a Road User Charges study, will further enhance
sustainable financing o f the road sector. The component covers:

       (i) Periodic        maintenance     and current    repairs    works   on   national roads,
               [USD 109.5 million, Loan USD 87.6 million]. This comprises financial support
               for the RNCMNR's Infrastructure Maintenance Program, which covers the period
               2006 - 2007 and is part o f a larger national roads development Program that
               covers the period up to 2013. Supporting this component ensures that there is an
               appropriate balance between expenditures on maintenance, reconstruction and
               development within the multi-year road investment program. RNCMNR's
               periodic maintenance program identifies priority road sections (totaling
               approximately 2,900 km) based on an economic analysis usingHDMmodel. The
               program includes both pavement resurfacing o f heavily trafficked roads using an
               asphalt concrete (AC) overlay, and single and double surface treatment o f
               medium traffic roads.       A C overlay improves ride quality leading to lower
               operating costs for road users, guarantees structural soundness o f the road for a
               prolonged period and prevents collapse, leading to lower life-cycle cost for the
               road asset. Surface treatment i s a cost-effective strategy to seal the road surface
               against ingress o f water, arrest deterioration o f the road surface, and provide a
               skidresistant road surface with the resultant benefits o freduction inaccidents.

       (ii)    Technical assistance for RNCMNR, [USD 3.0 million, Loan USD 2.4 million].
               This comprises studies and consulting services to be carried out in 2006 - 2008
               aimed at:
                    (a) Preparing and implementing a pilot output-based area-wide multi-year
                         maintenance contracts, with the objective o f gradually expanding the
                         coverage to the entire country within four years. The Bank's recent
                         review o f national roads maintenance practices inRomania indicated that
                         road maintenance costs are high when compared with other countries in
                         Eastern Europe. It i s expected that the combination o f this component
                         and the TRP-supported improvements in management and technical
                         capacity within the RNCMNR through the application o f modem
                         pavement and bridge management systems will improve RNCMNR's
                         maintenance efficiency.
                     (b) Hiring a Technical Adviser to improve management and technical
                         capacity within the RNCMNR. The Technical Adviser would support
                         RNCMNR management for a total o f four months each year.
                    (c) Conducting a first road user satisfaction survey.
                     (d) Training of relevant staff within RNCMNR on the preparation,
                         procurement and technicaVfinancia1 management o f maintenance
                         activities.
                     (e) The design o fperiodic maintenance and current repairs works.


Component B: Railway Sector Support, [USD 112.5 million, Loan USD 90.0 million].            This
component supports the Infrastructure Maintenance Program o f railways which covers 2006 and
2007 and includes maintenance, current and periodic repair and overhaul o f interoperable
railway lines, and technical assistance to CFR. Interoperable railway lines are defined by
Government DecisionNo. 27/2004 andrefer to Romania's railway network excluding those lines
which are part o f the network downsizing plan outlined in the same Government Decision. The
technical assistance is aimed at modernizing CFR's infrastructure maintenance practices by
taking advantage of available IT systems and the track geometry car. This component i s based on
projected maintenance needs o f the main railway lines, and the economic and financial analyses.
Inthe past few years, CFR's own revenues and contributions from the state budget have fallen
far short o f the needs to finance the infrastructure maintenance, repair and overhaul.     The
component covers:

(i)     Maintenance, current and periodic repair and overhaul works o f main lines, and
        supply o f necessary goods, [USD98.7 million, Loan USD79.0 million]. This
        comprises financial support for CFR's Infrastructure Maintenance Program for
        interoperable lines which covers 2006 and 2007. This program is part o f CFR's
        longer term infrastructure maintenance program spanning2006-2010 whose main
        objective i s to eliminate temporary speed restrictions and improve the safety o f
        traffic. This component i s designed to fund three types o f maintenance works: (a)
        overhaul o f public infrastructure      - tracks, bridges, tunnels, embankments,
        interlocking and signaling electrification systems (45 percent o f cost); (b) repair
        and maintenance o f tracks, bridges, tunnels, and embankments (35 percent of
        cost); and (c) repair andmaintenance of interlocking, signaling, and electrification
        systems (20 percent o f cost).

         CFR's program supported by the proposed loan has been identified based on an
         analysis o f track condition and the importance of traffic. The program targets
        interoperable railway lines providing links between the Romanian railway
        network and neighboring countries' railway networks. Nine lines have been
         already included in the initial list o f the program. This list will be adjusted
         accordingly should more lines need to be included inthe 2006-2007 program. The
         nine initial lines span some 2,193 line-km, representing some 20 percent o f the
         total railway network, and carry 27 percent o ftotal train-kilometers. They are:

    At the end o f 2005, temporary speed restrictions were imposed on 409 km o f
    these lines, 134 bridges and 165 footbridges. A total o f 30 emergency category
    locations generated 8 railway incidents in 2005, without injuries, because o f the
    condition o f the railway infrastructure.

    The main outputs o f CFR's program over the period 2006-2007 would be to bring
    back those priority lines to normal standards o f operations with: (a) a decrease in
    the number o f dangerous spots; (b) a reduction o f speed restriction sections; and
    (c) an improvement o f traffic safety with the repair and overhaul o f signaling
    systems overdue for maintenance.          Over the 2006-2010 period,         CFR's
    maintenance program on the identified priority lines would allow to remove all
    current dangerous spots and reduce the length o f line generating speed
    restrictions.

(ii)Technical assistance for CFR, [USD 10.8 million, Loan USD 9.2 million],
    comprising studies and consulting services to be carried out in2006 - 2008 for the
    implementation o f the maintenance program, including (a) the design o f
    maintenance works; (b) procurement and financial management trainings; and (c)
    support to improve CFR railway management practices through the development
    o f updated Business Plans for the periods 2007-2011and 2008-2012 following (i)
    a structure agreed with the Bank, (ii)the recommendations made by the
    consultants inthe context o f the TRP technical assistance, and (iii)
                                                                        consistent with
    the Government Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. The development o f an
    immediate and a near term (5 year) maintenance planbased on the effective use o f
    the IT system and the track geometry car will be carried out through the TRP
    Technical Assistance for CFR's maintenance management program.

Background

The loan will be channeled through the Ministry o f Public Finance to the Ministryo f Transport,
Construction and Tourism. The project will be implemented by RNCMNR and CFR for the
national roads and railways, respectively; for the county roads a new management entity will be
established as described in this annex, the related consultancy will be managed by RNCMNR.
Both RNCMNR and CFR have experience in implementing World Bank projects and will be
responsible for all technical aspects o f the project, including planning, procurement o f goods and
services, implementation o f civil works, institutional strengthening and training. Supervision o f
civil works will be carried out by the regional offices o f RNCMNR and CFR. Administration o f
the Dedicated Accounts and project accounting will be done separately by the project
management entities. Consolidated accounts and reports to the Bank for all project components
will be undertaken by the RNCMNR and CFR.

ProjectManagement

The MTCT will have overall responsibility for project oversight and coordination with other
IFIs, the EU (ISPA and Cohesion Fund programs), bilateral agencies, and the private sector
partners. Management o f the project components will be undertaken separately for the roads and
railways. The RNCMNR will manage all o f the roads components, and the railways
infrastructure company, CFR, will manage all o f the railways components.

For the roads component, RNCMNR has established departments that perform specialized
functions such as planning and development, road safety, maintenance management, financial
management, and a PPP unit. These departments and units have previous experience with
managing Bank financed projects, and therefore the present administrative arrangements and
operational procedures within the organization will be maintained while complying with
fiduciary, procurement and safeguard requirements o f the Bank. Because o f recent management
changes, both the ongoing TRP project and this new project will provide technical assistance on
reorganizing RNCMNR and managing both the organization and the national roads more
effectively.

For the railways component, project management will be undertaken by CFR. A Project
Management Unit (PMU) to manage all IF1funded projects was established within CFR under
the previous Bank financed loan. The PMU has well defined operational procedures and
competent staff that has accumulated significant experience with the Bank's fiduciary,
procurement and safeguard procedures andrequirements.

Summary

Country Issues

The first Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for Romania was finalized in
December 2003 and concluded that the overall fiduciary risk associated with the public financial
management and financial accountability arrangements o f the Romanian Government
administration i s considered to be moderate, with the systems for accounting, financial reporting
andinternal control representingthe areas with the higher risks andbudgeting,cashmanagement
and external audit and Parliamentary oversight representing the lower risks.

The implications o f the CFAA for the project are addressedby the following actions:
       ---- A detailedreview o fthe systems was performedfor eachproject implementing entity;
            Eachproject implementing entity has a distinct project-specific accounting ledger;
            Project accounting staff has been nominated for each project implementing entity;
            The format o f the Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) was agreed with both project

       -    implementing entities;
            RNCMNR and CFR entities' as well as Transport Sector Support Project financial
            statements will be audited by an independent auditor annually.

Theproject will relyto the extent possibleon several elements o f financial management country
systems, as follows:
       --   staffing: the project staff will be employees o f RNCMNR and CFR;
            internal control: the project will use the existing internal control mechanisms within

       --   the implementing agencies;
            flow o f funds: the Project will use the Treasury to the extent possible;

Risk Assessment and Mitigation Measures

The risk analysis from the Financial Management Questionnaires is as presented below. (Note:
The project's financial management risks are not considered to be significant enough to warrant
inclusion insection C.5 o fthe PAD).

Strengths and Weaknesses

The significant strengths that will provide a basis of reliance on the project's financial
management systems include the experience o f the existing project implementation teams, one
within RNCMNR, currently in charge with the implementation o f the roads components o f the
Transport Restructuring Project (Loan 4757-RO), and the Second Roads Project (Loan 4178-
RO); and the other one within the CFR, currently incharge with the implementation o f railways
components o f the Transport Restructuring Project, and which was also in charge with the
implementation o fthe Railway Rehabilitation Project (Loan 3976-RO).
Implementing Entities

The existing project implementationteams establishedwithin the RNCMNR andthe CFR, would
be responsible for the financial management aspects of the roads components, and o f the
railways components, respectively, of the proposed Transport Sector Support Project.
Funds Flow

Project fimds will flow inrespect o f each o f the sources of project financing as follows:
         (i)the   Bank loan, by direct payments or via the two designated accounts, which will be
              replenished initially based on transactional disbursement procedures and then, once
              the Borrower elects to change, on report-based disbursement procedures; and
         (ii)Governmentcounterpartcontribution,viadedicatedTreasuryprojectaccounts.

Two designated accounts will be opened at commercial banks and on terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank. One designated account will be opened for the RNCMNR inrespect o f
its roads components and another designated account will be opened for the CFR inrespect of its


                                                  44

railways components. Foreign currency amounts will be exchanged as needed inlocal currency
(RON), to cover eligible expenditures payments in local currency to suppliers, from the
designated accounts into local currency transfer accounts.
Government counterpart contribution payments will be made from separate Treasury project
accounts, being sub-accounts o f the entities' main budgetary accounts, and which will be used
specifically for the counterpart contributions to the project. These contributions will be received
monthly inaccordance with normal budget procedures.

Staffing

Eachimplementing entity i s staffed as follows interms o fproject financial management:


    0   RNCMNR has nominated among its existing staff the project financed manager, project
        disbursement officer and project accountant, all having considerable experience on Bank-
        financedprojects;
    0   CFR has nominated among its existing staff the project financed manager, project
        disbursement officer andproject accountant, all having considerable experience on Bank-
        financedprojects.




                                                    45

Accounting Policies and Procedures

The project's accounting books and records at the various agencies will be maintained on an
accrual basis and denominated innew Romanian Lei (RON) with the exception o f the books and
records in respect o f the designated accounts which will be maintained in the currency o f the
IBRDLoan.

The RNCMNR and CFR have in place appropriate accounting regulations and internal controls
including authorization and segregation o f duties documented intheir internal control procedures
andregulations.


Audit Arrangements

Internal Audit

Both RNCMNR and CFR have an internal audit department. It is anticipated that these internal
audit departments will review the project's financial management arrangements. The internal
audit departments in both implementing entities will include in their annual work program the
Transport Sector Support Project, as part o f their entities' overall activities.

A number o f internal audit reports prepared by the relevant departments o f the implementing
entities have been reviewed. The various findings reported do not have an impact on the project.
External Audit

As o f the date o f this report, the Borrower is not incompliance with the audit covenants for the
Second Roads Project (Loan 4178-RO) and for the Transport Restructuring Project (Loan 4757-
RO). These covenants require submission to the Bank o f the audited C Y 2005 Financial
Statements for both RNCMNR and CFR, which were all due on June 30, 2006, but had not yet
been received.

The delay inthe submission o f C Y 2005 audit reports is mainly due to the late submissiono f C Y
2004 audit reports which were submittedat the end o fJune 2006 by RNCMNR, and at the end of
April 2006 byCFR. The RNCMNR hadagreed amulti-year audit contract with RSMHaarmann
Hemmelrath auditors covering the period C Y 2004 - 2008, subject to annual review. Following
submission o f the C Y 2004 audit reports, the Bank was informed that R S M Haarmann
Hemmelrath had requested a significant fee increase to perform the C Y 2005 audit services, and
this had not been accepted by RNCMNR. Consequently, RNCMNR decided to issue a new
tender for audit services covering the period CY2005 -2008. Inthe case o f CFR, the process for
procurement o f multi-year audit services was started in April 2006, but was subsequently
cancelled due to issues related to the Ministerial order appointing the evaluation committee. In
addition, a single offer was received to perform audits for the three state owned railway
companies. Although a single bid would have been acceptable for CFR under Bank procedures,
it was deemed to be unacceptable by the other railway companies under Romanian Procurement
Law. As a result, CFR advised the Bank that the single bid received for audit services was
rejected and a new tender will be issued requesting audit services only for CFR and its
subsidiaries.


                                                 46

Both RNCMNR and CFR had re-started the procurement process by the end o f September 2006
for the selection o f auditors in accordance with Bank guidelines, and have committed to
completing the procurement process by December 15, 2006. The new contracts to be issued by
RNCMNR and CFR will include deadlines for submitting the final audit reports for C Y 2005 by
April 30, 2007, and September 30, 2007 for the C Y 2006 final audit reports. Inorder to comply
with this schedule, the requests for proposals for audit services had to be issued by RNCMNR
and CFR by September 30, 2006 with the deadline for submission o f proposals byNovember 6,
2006, and contracts to be signed with the selected auditors inDecember 2006.

A waiver o f Bank Operational Policy OP 10.02 was therefore approved by Bank management,
regarding the delay by RNCMNR and CFR to submit the above mentioned audit reports for
CY2005.

The National Administration o f Roads (i.e. RNCMNR's predecessor entity) had been audited in
accordance with ISA since its incorporation in 1998 by independent external auditors. The
auditors issued a qualified-exception opinion on NAR's financial statements for 2000, 2001,
2002 and on RNCMNR's financial statements for 2003, due to issues relating to the application
o f I A S 36 and aspects pertaining to fixed assets. The first audit o f RNCMNR (for CY2004) as a
commercial entity highlighted the weak financial position o f RNCMNR. This i s primarily a
consequence o f the legal status o f the RNCMNR established as ajoint stock company subject to
commercial company laws, and is also due to the absence o f a clearly defined long term revenue
stream commensurate with the RNCMNR's financial obligations. The Ministry o f Transport i s
committed to address these financial issues as outlined in Annex 4 through a reform o f
RNCMNR institutional, legal and financial framework.

The auditors issued a qualified-disclaimer opinion because o f the inadequacy o f the financial
statements prepared by RNCMNR for 2004, particularly regarding the impairment o f assets, the
valuation o f the concession rights over the Romanian National road network, the valuation o f the
capital account, and the value o f deferred income from Rovinieta. This reveals financial
management weaknesses within the RNCMNR which will be addressed through a technical
assistance to be funded under the on-going Transport Restructuring Project (Loan 4757-RO) in
order to start working on these issues inparallel with the preparation o f the pending2005 audit
reports.

CFR has been audited in accordance with ISA since its incorporation in 1998 by independent
external auditors.    The auditors issued a qualified-disclaimer opinion on CFR's financial
statements for 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004 due to issues relating to the inventories, accounts
receivable and other receivables. These issues will also be addressed through the Technical
Assistance financed under the TRP.

The Second Roads Project Financial Statements and Railway Rehabilitation Project Financial
Statements received always clean audit opinions over their implementation life. The Transport
Restructuring Project audit reports were due on June 30, 2006, as it became effective in mid
2005. However, since neither RNCMNR nor CFR have yet finalized the appointment o f the
auditors, the FY 2005 entity audit reports have not yet beenprepared.

The Transport Sector Support Project will be audited annually bothby an audit firm and on terms
o f reference acceptable to the Bank. The terms o f reference for the audit have been agreed upon
andare attached to the minutes o fnegotiations. The audit scope will include the project's books
andrecords as maintainedby each implementing entity, all quarterlyinterimfinancial reports, all
withdrawal applications and the designated accounts. The audited project financial statements
together with the auditor's opinion thereon will be provided to the Bank within six months o fthe
end o f the reporting period, being the fiscal year. The audit contract will be financed by the
Loan 4757-RO (Transport Restructuring Project) and be awarded to an audit firm for the life o f
theproject, subject to satisfactory performance.

The RNCMNR and CFR entities financial statements will be audited annually, both by audit
firms and on terms o f reference acceptable to the Bank. The terms o f reference for the audit
have been agreed upon at negotiations. The costs o f these audits will be also covered by the
Loan 4757-R0. In addition, the Romanian Court o f Accounts (CoA), the country's supreme
audit institution, will continue to perform ad hoc external audits o f the implementing entities,
including o f this project. The CoA will also perform an operational review o f the Transport
Sector Support Project.

The latest audit report prepared by the CoA for the MTCT, which covered also the RNCMNR
and CFR, as subordinated entities o f MTCT has been reviewed. The CoA has granted the
`discharge o f responsibility', being a process o f whereby the CoA confirms that a budget holder
has discharged its obligations in respect o f the execution and reporting o f the budget, to the
above mentioned budgetaryholders.
DisbursementArrangements

Bank funds willbe disbursedeither as direct payments, or to the two designated accounts opened
by each entity, which will be initially replenished under the transactional disbursement
procedures.    Subsequently, the Borrower may elect to change to report-based disbursement
procedures. Withdrawal applications for the replenishments o f the designated accounts will be
sent to the Bank directly by each responsible project implementing entity quarterly, together with
the relevant documents required for transactional disbursement procedures. Once the Borrower
elects to change to report-based disbursement, withdrawal applications will be accompanied by
the quarterly un-audited interim financial reports, Supporting documentation for all transactions,
including completion reports, goods received notes and acceptance certificates, will be retained
bythe implementing entities andmade available to the Bank duringproject supervision.
ReportingandMonitoring

Quarterly interim financial reports (IFRs) will be used initially used for project monitoring and
supervision and subsequently, once the Borrower elects to change to report-based disbursement,
IFRs will be used for disbursement purposes and project monitoring and supervision.           The
project implementing teams in RNCh4NR and CFR will produce the project's IFRs every
calendar quarter and the reports will be submitted to the Bank within 45 days after the calendar
quarter-end. Formats o f IFRs have been agreed and are attached to the minutes o fnegotiations.




                                                 48

InformationSystems

Each entity already has access to an accounting software system on which it has created and will
maintainproject-specific accounting ledgers, as follows:

         RNCMNR - a project-specific accounting ledger created within its existing entity
         accounting software system to record the operations o f the project, using the existing
         chart of accounts;
         CFR - a project-specific accounting ledger created within its existing entity accounting
         software system to record the operations o f the project, using the existing chart o f
         accounts.


Action Plan(Agreedwith Borrower)

         RNCMNR to submit acceptable FY 2004 entity audit reports by June 30, 2006.
         Subsequent to the negotiations, the 2004 audit reports were received on June 30, 2006,
         andwere deemed satisfactory bythe Bank.
    0    The MTCT has agreed to a remedial action plan18to address the issues raised inthe 2004
         entity audit report for RNCMNR. The MTCT action plan includes a commitment to
         review and remedy the legal and financial position o f the RNCMNR. The action plan
         includes reviewing and amending the RNCMNR legal status, and the financing
         framework and organizational structure in order to ensure compliance with EU
         Directives, to improve the short and long term financial health o f the company, and to
         strengthen internal financial management capacity through technical assistance to be
         fundedunder the on-going Transport RestructuringProject (Loan 4757-RO) (TRP)."
    0    In view of the similarity of the issues relating to IFRS implementation and financial
         reporting previously raised for the Romania National Railway Company (CFR) in
         previous audit reports, the MTCT has decidedthat this technical assistance should benefit
         both RNCMNR and CFR. This technical assistance will be financed under the on-going
         TRP.
SupervisionPlan

During project implementation, the Bank will supervise the project's financial management
arrangements in two main ways: (i)            review the project's quarterly interim financial reports
(IFRs) as well as the entities' and project's annual audited financial statements and auditor's
management letter; and (ii)during the Bank's supervision missions, review the project's
financial management and disbursement arrangements (including a review o f a sample o f
withdrawal applications, supporting documentation for transactions and movements on the
designated accounts) to ensure compliance with the Bank's financial management requirements.

                              Annex 8: ProcurementArrangements
                 ROMANIA: TRANSPORT SECTOR SUPPORT PROJECT


General

Procurement for the proposedproject would be carried out inaccordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May
2004, in addition to the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The various items under
different expenditure categories are described ingeneral below. For each contract to be financed
by the Loan, the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for
pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed between
the Borrower and the Bank in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at
least twice a year or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and
improvements ininstitutional capacity.

Procurementof Works: Works procured under this project would include, for the major part,
periodic maintenance and current repairs works o f roads and maintenance, current and periodic
repair and overhaul o f railway infrastructure. The procurement will be done using the Bank's
Standard BiddingDocuments (SBD) for all ICB and National SBD agreed with or satisfactory to
the Bank, such as the ECA Regional Sample Document for Works under National Competitive
Bidding (NCB) procedure for Works contracts estimated to cost less than USD 5 millions or
equivalent, (the latter Document has already been translated into Romanian language for the
needs o f a former Bank-financed project, Hazard Risk Mitigation & Emergency Preparedness
Project). Advanced procurement (and the use o f retroactive financing clause with bank's review
o f procurement procedures) is envisaged mostly for road maintenance works. The Shopping
proceduremay be used for minor works o f low value (less than USD 100,000 or equivalent).

Procurement of Goods: Goods procured under this project would include maintenance
materials and equipment mostly for the railways component, and more particularly for the
purchase o f rails, sleepers, fastening and signaling equipment for CFR maintenance, repair and
overhaul works. The procurement will be done using the Bank's SBD for all ICB, and National
SBD agreed with or satisfactory to the Bank for goods contracts estimated to cost less than USD
500,000 or equivalent, and awarded under National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedure. For
very small goods contracts (less than USD 100,000 or equivalent), to purchase readily available
off-the-shelf goods (including hardware and software) or standard specification commodities, the
Shoppingprocedure would be used.

Procurementof non-consultingservices: Services related to goods and works contracts, such
as transportation, insurance, installation, commissioning, training and initial maintenance, as
well as survey, geotechnical boring and data gathering, topographic and mapping services may
be procured under procedures compatible with the Bank's procurement guidelines for works,
goods and services contracted on the basis o f a measurable physical output.




                                                 50

Selection of Consultants:       (QCBS i s the selection method unless otherwise specified)
Consulting services would include technical assistance to RNCMNR for maintenance and repairs
works design and maintenance contracting, as well as technical assistance for improvement o f
maintenance management, and for roads management (including road user survey), consultancy
for the pilot output-based area-wide roads maintenance project; and technical assistance to CFR
for railways maintenance works (including design and inspection ), as well as a larger
consultancy for capacity building in CFR Management (including new business plan) and
Procurement. Consulting services for design and inspection to RNCMNR and CFR, the roaduser
surveys and audit services may be procured under Least Cost Selection method (or selection
based on Consultant's Qualifications, which may also be used for any consultant services
estimated to cost less than USD 200,000 or equivalent). Short lists o f consultants for services
estimated to cost less than USD 200,000 equivalent per contract may be composed entirely o f
national consultants in accordance with the provisions o f paragraph 2.7 o f the Consultant
Guidelines. Available, "ready made" training programs from International Institutions such as
ILO, for example, may be single sourced for very small amounts (less than USD 25,000 Dollars
per contract), or selected after comparison o f three or more different programs. Individual
consultants may be selected on the basis o f comparison o f qualifications for the training of
RNCMNR staff.

The procurement procedures to be used for each procurement method, as well as initial prior
review thresholds for works, goods and services contracts to be procured, are presented in the
Procurement Plan and its preamble, which may be updated with the concurrence o f the Bank.

Assessment of the projectimplementingentities' capacityto implementprocurement

Procurement activities will be carried out by CFR for the railways. CFR i s staffed by a very
experienced director for IFIs programs who knows well Bank procurement procedures for many
years andmanaged several Bank-hdedprojects, andthe procurement function is also staffed by
two procurement specialists and a procurement analyst.

The RNCMNR has well established departments or units that perform specialized functions such
as planningand development, road safety, maintenance management, financial management, and
a PPP unit. Consequently, the project will utilize established procedures for procurement and
financial management. The various departments and units within RNCMNR have previous
experience with managing Bank-financed projects, and therefore the present administrative
arrangements within the organization will be maintained. Because o f recent management
changes, the ongoing TRP project provides technical assistance on reorganizing RNCMNR and
managing it more effectively.

A short assessment o f the capacity o f the Project Implementing Entities to implement
procurement actions for the project has been carried out by the Bank Team's procurement
specialist during pre-appraisal mission.    The assessment reviewed the available staff, the
organizational structure for implementing the project and the interaction between the project's
staff responsible for procurement, the Ministry, and the National Public Procurement Agency
ANRMAP. The two project implementingentities decided after appraisal mission to include in
their procurement plan a training (Consultancy services) line with a significant cost estimate to

provide procurement capacitybuildingat central national andregional levels. These procurement
training contracts are to be launched immediately after effectiveness.

The overall project risk for procurement is highandwill therefore require mitigating measures.

The key issues and risks concerning procurement for implementation o f the project have been
identified and include the turnover resulting from low civil servant salaries, and the general
country procurement climate and capacity (see the Joint Bank EU PAMreport conclusions).
                                                                   -
The corrective measures which are requiredhave beendiscussed with MTCT and the two project
implementing entities. The Bank has been informed that the Government has approved the
principle o f changes to the remuneration o f M T C T staff working on IF1projects to align this
with those o f staff working on EU projects, however, this had not yet been effected. The
implementation o f a training program on Bank-financed procurement and fiduciary matters is
included inthe procurement plano fthe Project for both implementing entities.

ProcurementPlan

The Borrower, at appraisal, developed a procurement plan for project implementation which
provides the basis for the procurement methods. This plan has been agreed between the
Borrower and the Project Team on May 26, 2006 and is available at the two project
implementing entities offices (RNCMNR and CFR). It will also be available in the project's
database and in the Bank's external website, without the estimated cost column. The
Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement with the Bank Project Team at least twice each
year or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in
institutional capacity.

Frequencyof ProcurementSupervision

In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the capacity
assessment o f the two Project Implementing Entities has recommended three supervision
missions per year to visit the field to carry out post review o fprocurement actions.

                           Annex 9:Economicand FinancialAnalysis
                ROMANIA: TRANSPORT SECTORSUPPORT PROJECT

This annex presents the economic and financial analysis o f the project. It comprises four main
sections: (i)economic analysis of the roads component; (ii)      economic analysis o f the railways
component; (iii)  financial analysis o f the roads component; and (iv) financial analysis o f the
railways component.

Economicanalysisof the roads component

RNCMNR performed an economic evaluation o f periodic road maintenance and rehabilitation
included in the first year o f the program. The evaluation was done using the Highway Design
andMaintenancemodel (HDM-111),which simulates life cycle conditions and costs andprovides
economic decision criteria for road construction and maintenance activities. HDMwas used for
estimating the net benefits o f each project in terms o f reductions in vehicle operating costs,
passenger travel time, androadmaintenance expenditures.

RNCMNR's proposed national roads periodic maintenance would improve ride quality leading
to lower operating costs for road users, guarantee structural soundness o f the road for a
prolonged period and prevent collapse, leading to lower life-cycle cost for the road asset. The
program also includes surface treatment, which is a cost-effective strategy to seal the road
surface against ingress o f water, arrest deterioration o f the road surface, and provide a skid
resistant road surface with the resultant benefits o freduction inaccidents.

The road rehabilitation projects included in the first year o f the program yield a Net Present
Value, at 12percent discount rate, o fUSD 165 million.

RNCMNR used traffic data from the recently conducted national traffic counts in 2005. The
traffic growth rates were based on several studies. Between 2000 and 2004, freight transport by
road recorded a growth rate o f over 27 percent per year. In passenger transport, intercity bus
travel, as an economic and highly competitive mode, has also grown and will continue to do so.
Private car traffic i s also growing fast as car ownership will grow with growing per capita
income.

Inputs for vehicle operating costs are based on current prices, adjusted to economic prices, o f
vehicles, spare parts, fuel as well as current operating conditions inRomania.

The value o f time for car passengers and for bus passengers are updated based on recent traffic
interview surveys and the estimated average gross wage rate inRomania.

Economicanalysisof the railways component

The proposed project will support CFR's infrastructure maintenance, current andperiodic repair,
and overhaul program for interoperable lines during 2006-2007.         It is designed to fund three
types o f maintenance and rehabilitation works: (a) overhaul o f public railway infrastructure
(45 percent o f cost); (b) repair and maintenance o f track 35 percent o f cost); and (c) repair and


                                                 54

maintenance (20 percent o f cost). The main objective is to eliminate temporary speed restrictions
andimprove the safety o ftraffic.

The program targets the mainlines o fthe interoperable network. Because regular maintenance
has been curtailed, andinsome cases poor quality materials were used inprevious rehabilitation
work, a number o frestrictions have beennecessary.

From 1995 to 2005, the length o f tracks generating speed restrictions increased from 386 km to
over 630 km2'. The number and total length o f weakened track segments generating hazard
points increased from 930 and 480 km in 1992, to 1 060 and 550 km in 2005, respectively.
Bridges, footbridges and tunnels with expired lifetime are increasingly generating speed
restrictions andimpose to lower the rankingo f lines interms o f average speed.

Characteristics o f the first set o f nine lines that are candidates for CFR's 2006-2007 program are
listed inthe table below.

The economic evaluation was carried out for a first set o f nine lines, which are part o f CFR's
maintenance program, This evaluation assessed separately for every line. The following benefits
were assessed: (i)  direct savings on track maintenance; (ii)     removal o f speed restrictions leading
to time savings for passengers, savings in freight costs due to better utilization o f wagons and
locomotives, and savings inboth passenger and freight train crew costs (time). Time savings on
highvalue andperishable cargo arenot considered. The evaluationperiodis taken as 20years.

The "do-minimum" scenario i s the deferred rehabilitation alternative which corresponds to
delaying the needed investments by five years and spreading them over a longer period o f ten
years. It i s assumed that 2003-2004 traffic levels will be sustained.

Removal o f speed restrictions i s assumed to produce an increase o f the average commercial
speed at the end o f the investment program by 30 percent for passenger trains and by 40 percent
for freight trains. In the case o f the "do-minimum" scenario, the average commercial speed i s
assumed to decrease until the fifth year, afterwards, the implementation o f the deferred
investmentprogram over a 10-yearperiod would bring the speeds back to those reached under
the "do-something" scenario.

A summary o ftheresults o fthis analysis ispresented inthe table below. Itwas agreed that
should CFR include new lines inthe program, these new lines will be subjected to the same
economic test.

Financial analysis of the roads component

Road sector revenues
Inaddition to vehicle registration fees which are collected by local authorities and are not used
for national roads, the two main charges road users pay are excise taxes on fuel andRovinieta.
The Rovinieta i s a charge introduced in 2003 for using the road network and is levied on both
domestic and foreign vehicles in a similar way, based on the lengtho f time that vehicles use the
roads. After a transition period, the Rovinieta rates will be set at the maximum allowable by the
EUin2008 bringingannual revenues to aroundEUR280 million.

Fuel excise taxes are the main charge road users pay. This excise tax i s channeled directly to the
general budget. Excise taxes on fuel used in the road transport sector were estimated around
EUR81021million in 2004. The average excise tax was EUR0.26 per liter. The level o f fuel
excise taxes inRomania i s at the lower end o f all EU25 countries.


*'2005EUR    876 million.


                                                    56

In practice, little of the revenues from fuel excise taxes are spent on road maintenance (only
EUR51 million from the budget was spent on national road maintenance and repairs in2004).
The General State Budget's total contribution to national roads in2004 was EUR248 million out
o f total national roads expenditures o f EUR 721 million.

An increase in fuel excise tax rates would provide additional revenues for the Government and
allow additional State budget contribution to fund the road sector. In the Accession Treaty,
Romania has obtained derogation from Article 7 o f Directive 2003/96/EC, and it may apply
transitional periods: (i)      until 1January 2011to adjust the national level of taxation on unleaded
petrol used as propellant to the minimum level o f EUR359 per 1,000 liters. The effective tax
rate applied to unleaded petrol used as propellant shall not be less than EUR323 (currently
EUR272) per 1,000 liters as from 1 January 2008; and (ii) 1 January 2013 to adjust the
                                                                                until
national level o f taxation on gas oil used as propellant to the minimum level o f EUR 330 per
1,000 liters. The effective tax rate applied to gas oil used as propellant shall not be less than
EUR274 per 1,000 liters as from 1 January 2008 (currently EUR207) and EUR302 per 1,000
liters as from 1January 2011.

Past sector spending andfinancing

Inthe past five years, fundingfor the road sector inRomaniahas beenless thanrequired to keep
an efficient road network, The total spending on roads in Romania over the period 2000-2004
was on average about 1.01percent o f GDP.Maintenance spendingin2000-2002 was particularly
low at 0.27 percent o f GDP.

(1) Inaddition to actual maintenance expenditures, RNCMNR includes inthis expenditure category: administrative expenses and
repayment of short term commercial loans incurred inprevious years to finance periodic maintenance.

During the period 2000-2005, sources o f h d s to finance expenditures on national roads
included: (i)     Road Fund revenues until 2002; (ii)             contributions from the general State budget;
(iii) RNCMNR's own revenues such as Rovinieta since 2003; (iv) sovereign borrowing from
IFIs; (v) sovereign commercial loans; and (vi) short term commerqial loans by RNCMNR.

Duringthe period 2000-2002, 65 percent o f Road Fundrevenues were channeled to the national
roads (the other 35 percent were used for county roads). This source o f funding provided the
national roads with 24 percent o f their total sources o f funding. The Road Fund income covered


                                                            57

the administrative expenses o f the national road administration, routine maintenance, and the
costs o f limitedrehabilitation works of the national roads. The Road Fundwas replacedin2003
and levies that previously went to the Road Fundgo now channeled to the State budget.

Sovereign borrowing from IFIs includes loans from EIB, EBRD, IBRD, and JBIC, mainly to
finance the roads rehabilitation program, by-passes, and some sections of the motonvay program.
Duringthe period2000-2002, loans from IFIsrepresented33 percent of all sources offunds.

EUgrants, PHARFiandISPA funds, contributed in2000-2002 period 3.7 percent of all sources.
This share increased sharply in2004 and 2005 to cover close to 15 percent of all sources of road
funding.

Planned sector spending and sources of funds

The Government is reviewing the 2005 Roads Sector Strategy in view o f accommodating new
sources of revenues from EUGrants. The 2005 strategy implies significant spending inthe roads
sector. Ina scenario where the Government scales down proposed investments in the strategy,
total spending on national roads would amount to an average 2.36 percent of GDP over the 2007-
2013 period.    Inthis case, state budget would contribute with 32percent of needed funds,
RNCMNR's own revenues with 11percent, IF1 loans with 37 percent, EU grants with
13 percent, and sovereign commercial loans and the private sector with 7 percent.

Financing of national roads maintenance

Inthe past few years, RNCMNRhasbeenusingshort term commercial loans to finance periodic
maintenance and repair works. However, until the introduction o f Rovinieta charge i s fully
completed in 2008, and these commercial loans are fully paid off, RNCMNR will need
additional funds to fully implement its maintenance program (Table).

component over the next 20 years. The project incremental cost i s the difference between the
project's investment program and the maintenance expenses deferred by 5 years, spread over 10
years that CFR would incur without the project. The elimination o f speed restriction would
increase the capacity o f the lines targeted by the project. It is assumed, however, that demand
would not increase nor would CFR be able to sell additional capacity to train operators. The
implementation o f improved maintenance practices would reduce permanent way maintenance
cost by 3 percent and labor by 2 percent annually over the period 2008-2009.

The financial costs, benefits and overall appraisal o f the project are summarized in the table
below. The financial analysis indicates that the project i s financially viable, returning a financial
internal rate o f return o f 13 percent and a positive net present value (NPV) o f USD 68.6 million

Recentfinancial performance of CFR and Government's contribution

CFR profitability has improved over the last five years, but its liquidity situation has seriously
deteriorated. Until2004, CFR profitability improved due to an increase inprofit margin without
subsidies, which was mostly due to the increase in Calatori's access charges in 2004 from
EUR 1.3 to EUR2.4 per train-km. However, this increase didnot materialize incash. Calatori's

inability to fully pay for the track access charge led to the deterioration of both CFR working
capital and liquidity ratios. CFR funded this cash shortfall through increased State and local
supplierpayables.

The combination of the Track Access charge increase and growing debt service payments has
driventhe State contribution to the railways from US$82 million in 1997 or 0.2 percent of GDP
to US$621 million in 2005 or 0.6percent of GDP. The overall allocation of Government
contributions has increasingly been concentrated on Calatori, from 73 percent to 83 percent o f
the total State support to the sector from 1998 to 2005. Excess o f rail passenger services also
contributed to building up Calatori and CFR arrears to the State social and pension funds which
peakedat 0.53 percent of GDP in2005.

Assumptionsfor the projectionof CFR financialperformance

CFR future financial situation was projected on the basis o f the Government's strategy approved
inAugust 2005. Detailed assumptionsare as follows:

   Operating expenditures

   (i)      Efficiencypackage: The network downsizing exercise will be completed by 2008 and
            generate about 3 percent o f operating cost savings from 2006 to 2008.
    (ii)    Maintenance expenditures: The implementation o f improved maintenance business
            models and practices will yield annual reductions o f 3 percent for maintenance costs
            and2 percent for labor from 2007 to 2010.

   Capital expenditures

            Therailway investment andmaintenanceprogram is derivedfrom CFR investment
            program from 2006-2010, the Government's strategy for the period2006-2013 and
            the SOPT for the period2007-2013.

   CFR's own b d s

            It is assumed that, between 2006 and 2013, passenger traffic would stabilize at 8.5
            billions passenger-km and freight traffic would grow from 14 billion ton-km to 18.5
            billion ton-km. These traffic projections are more conservative than the targets set out
            by the Government, which assume the passenger and freight traffic demandto reach
            9.3 billions passenger-km and 19.7 billions ton-km in 2013. Although the
            Government has planned to increase Calatori's fares and track access charge, it i s
            assumed that Calatori and Marfa track access charges will remain respectively at
            EUR2.3 andEUR3.6 pertrain-km.

    External financing sources:

            EUgrants are those preparedby MTCT and CFR inthe April 2006 draft SOPT. IFIs
            co-financing loans are taken into account for the projects included inthe SOPT. The
            Government contribution to the sector i s derived from (i) State's obligations in
                                                                        the


                                                 60

            terms o f EU grants co-financing and IFIs debt service payment as well as (ii)   the
            financial equilibrium constraints o f CFR (net income and change in cash equal to
            zero).

CFRprojectedfinancialperformance

The implementation o f this investment program will drive a significant increase o f CFR
investment costs. Whereas annual average investment costs ranged from 0.2 percent to
0.7 percent o f GDP from 2003 to 2005, CFR capital investments will amount to an annual
average o f EUR672 million or 1percent o f 2005 GDP over the period 2006-2013. Followingthe
implementation o f the improved maintenance program, CFR recurrent expenditures are expected
to decreaseby 2 percent per year from EUR364 million in2007 to EUR337 million in2013.

Over the period 2006-2013, the availability o f EUgrants will significantly change CFR financing
strategy. Until 2005, external borrowing funded about 60 percent of CFR new investments.
Starting in 2007, borrowing would be reduced to 38percent. Coverage of operating costs by
operating revenues would improve.

The set o f reforms intended by the Government for the 2006-2013 period and supported by the
project would lead to the gradual improvement o f CFR financial performance. Gains from the
efficiency package and improved maintenance practices would strengthen CFR profitability.
Starting in 2006, the working ratio without subsidies would be below loopercent. However,
CFR profit margin without subsidies would remain weak because o f the rise in depreciation
charges over the period. CFR financial viability would be robust with debt coverage ratios above
the required threshold both for loans to be repaid by CFR and the State. The relative
underperformance in2006 would mainly come from maintenance expenditures which would not
yet be offset by significant efficiency gains.

These projections suggest that this project will help CFR meet the financial performance targets
set in the current World Bank Transport Restructuring Project: working ratio of 115 percent in
2006 and 100percent in2009.

ProjectedGovernmentcontributions

Over the 2006-2013 period, total public expenditures from the Government's strategy are
estimated to overtake past historical levels o f State aid to the railways by 0.1 percent to
0.3 percent o f GDP. Government contributions are projected to increase from EUR 420 million
inin2005, andpeak at EUR749 millions or 0.93 percent of GDP in2009. This upwardtrend is
driven by CFR investment program, which increases it share from 16 percent to 43 percent o f the
total State support to the sector over 2006 -2013.

Maintaining the Government contributions to CFR to affordable levels will require better
planning and prioritizations o f CFR investments. The implementation o f CFR maintenance
efficiency package i s critical to containing the State support to CFR. Should the expected cost
savings from this project and the network downsizing be delayed, this would translate into an
additional State support o f 0.2 percent o f 2005 GDP over the period 2006-2013.

                             Environmentaland Social SafeguardIssues

Introduction

Following extensive global notification and consultations, inMarch 2005, the World BankBoard
approved a pilot program to test the use o f borrower or "country" systems for meeting the
objectives o f World Bank environmental and social safeguard policies. This led to the issuance
o f World Bank Operational Policy (OP) 4.0025, which lays out specific criteria for advancing
pilot projects. It was recognized in the background paper for Board consideration that sector-
specific Bank operations innew member states and candidates for EU accession hold particular
promise as pilots.

Two operations proposed for Romania were considered for piloting under OP 4.00 and were the
subject o f review in the Report: "Safeguards Diagnostic Review for Piloting the Use o f
Romanian Systems for Environmental and Social Safeguard Issues". The two operations are the
Municipal Services Project (MSP) and this proposed Transport Sector Support Project (TSSP).
The Municipal Services project will support the rehabilitation and improvement o f wastewater,
stormwater and drinking water systems to reduce pollution, improve public health, and assist
Romania inmeeting environmental requirements for European Union accession. The TSSP will
provide funds to rehabilitate and improve major road andrail infrastructure.

Incooperationwith Romanianofficials, andwith the support ofthe EuropeanCommission staff,
the World Bank has compared the Romanian systems (including those which stem from EU
directives) against the Operational Principles laid out in OP 4.00-Table A1 for key safeguards
that would normally apply to these two Bank-assisted projects. This assessment included a legal
and technical review; both on paper and through field interviews and site visits.               Report
conclusions were discussed at a public meeting in Bucharest on December 12, 2005, following
disclosure inRomania o f a draft Executive Summary.

The World Bank examined the acceptability o f the EA process along two lines: EA approval
procedures, and compliance monitoring during construction and operation. The Bank is pleased
to note that there i s a well defined process in place for screening, review, public consultation,
disclosure, and approval o f EA documents.               Regarding screening (i.e. determination o f the
appropriate EA category), projects falling on Romania's Annex Ilist26would typically fall inthe
World Bank's EA Category A. These mandatory EAs require a level o f attention to assessing
risk, alternatives and mitigatiodmonitoring (Le. scoping) which is comparable to World Bank
requirements for Category A projects.              Both the Municipal Services and Transport Sector

Assessment under the World Bank system, so ifsub-projects fall under Annex Io f the Romanian
system, they would receive more thorough due diligence for EA than they would under a stand-
alone World Bank project.

The approach to EA for projects on Romania's Annex I1list was also examined. The vast
majority o f these projects correspond to World Bank Category B though through the formal
Romanian EA process, the few that would correspond to Category A o f the World Bank would
receive an Annex Ilevel o f preparation and review. All sub-project categories being considered
under the Municipal Services and Transport Sector Support projects will likely, therefore, be
subjected under the Romanian system to at least an equivalent approach to EA screening,
scoping and analysis as set forth inWorld Bank OP 4.00.

While the EA documents are prepared by project proponents, an independent Technical
Committee i s established by Government to review each project.          The committee include
representatives o f local and regional environmental agencies, local officials, representatives o f
the Health services, the National Environmental Guard(inspection service), the Romanian Water
Company (`Apele Romane"), research institutes, etc.. Public participation during the EA process
includes at least one public consultation, and as many as three public announcements in local
newspapers or on the local environment agency website.          This approach should achieve
comparable outcomes as envisaged by the Bank under OP 4.00. Environmental sections o f
standardbiddingdocuments for roads and rail projects were examined and found comparable to
the core mitigation and monitoring aspects o f stand-alone Environmental Management Plans
normally included as a requirement o f World Bank safeguard policies.

Regarding implementation, a successful project application results in the issuance o f two
documents which are comparable in aim to the Environmental Management Plan required for
Bank projects. Following the acceptance o f the EA, an Environmental License to Construct
(called the "environmental agreement") i s issued for all projects with civil works.         After
construction, the project proponent is required by law to apply for the Environmental Permit to
Operate (sometimes called "environmental authorization"), which is issued only after a review
by local or regional environmental authorities. The Environmental License would have
measures/conditions to mitigate adverse impacts during construction and is issued by the
competent environmental authority based on the information obtained during the environmental
impact assessment procedure. Based on the "environmental agreement" the City Hall issues the
License to Construct. The Environmental Permit includes measures to be implemented during
operation and is issued only by the local EPA.        The permitting process includes setting
wastewater discharge limits (by Apele Romane).           Discharge standards and wastewater
management programs (e.g. receiving water quality) set by Romanian authorities are aligning
with comparable EU directives on wastewater and watershed management (as transposed into
Romanian law), and are quite consistent with the Bank's narrative descriptions o f good water
quality management programs inthe Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook (Part 11).

The World Bank review included meetings and site reviews in cooperation with environmental
officials at the local and regional levels. InRomania all key environmental responsibilities fall
under the Ministry o f Environment and Water Management (MEW). Preparation for EU



                                               65

accession has led and will likely continue to lead to considerable increases in staff at both the
policy and field levels. A core group o f environmental specialists are also on staff in key
regional offices responsible for rails and roads; a very important element in practical
implementation o f environmental requirements.

Regarding compliance monitoring, an independent agency under the M E W - the National
Environment Guard(NEG) - is tasked to carry out this responsibility. The NEGis being staffed
up and responsibilities strengthened through passing of bylaws and establishment o f good
working procedures. An ambitious training program i s also being implemented. Ifviolations in
licenses or permits are found, the NEGhas a range o f administrative orders andpenalties to issue
at its disposal.  There seems to be serious commitment at the senior management level to
improve the overall compliance level. The trend i s positive, with reportedly increased fines for
violations, more transparency, andreduced ambiguity insetting the fines (thereby helping reduce
corruption). It should be noted, however, that a fully staffedNEGwill not be inplace for about a
year, so effectiveness cannot yet be fully documented.

Inthe area of Environmental Assessment, the review concludes that there are no gaps regarding
the equivalence o f Romanian systems that would inhibit piloting. Differences in process or
application o f policies (for example continuing consultation during relatively higher risk sub-
projects) are not pertinent to the types o f sub-projects expected to be carried out under the pilots.
Strengthening o f the EA system has been accomplished recently as part o f the EU accession
process and further strengthening would be helpfulmore broadly for environmental performance
improvement, but i s not necessary to meet the due diligence requirements for the Municipal
Services and Transport Sector Support Projects. It should also be noted that the Bank's proposed
Environmental Management Loan (slated for delivery in FY07) is expected to provide
considerable capacity buildingwhich will directly and positively improve Romanian systems at
boththe policy and field levels.

Regarding cultural property, the Bank believes that Romanian systems are appropriate for
application to both operations. If either operation would require construction or rehabilitation
near to historic buildings or other physical cultural resources, or if "chance finds" are
encountered, we believe that Romanian systems are at least as effective as those outlined in
OPBP 4.00 on such points. Inventories o f buildings and sites o f cultural significance are
available, and are consulted to assess whether proposed investment projects might cause impact.
Local experts on archeology, architecture and other relevant fields are brought infor assessments
before construction decisions are made, and after if "chance finds" are encountered during
construction.

With respect to EA implementationpractices (the core o f the "acceptability analyses") the Bank
finds the current approach and direction o f Romanian institutions incarrying out sub-sector laws
and policies (including compliance and enforcement) to conform with the goals o f OP 4.00.
While several areas would benefit from strengthening (as part o f the country's overall
improvement in environmental management and implementation o f sectoral policies),
strengthening is not required for approving the Municipal Services or Transport Sector Support
Projects as pilots. Capacity-building under European Union programs, as well as the proposed
World BankEnvironmental Management Loan, will also be very supportive.

PrincipalObservations-InvoluntaryResettlement

Initially it was thought that the two pilot projects might involve small-scale land acquisition. No
physical relocation o fhouseholds or businesses was expected. Consequently, a legal analysis was
commissioned o f expropriation and related legislation, and the Bank met with officials in
national and local Governments who deal with expropriation, property assessors, and people
whose landhadbeen expropriated.

The analysis focused on the principles o f OP 4.00 that are applicable to expropriation and land
acquisition. Equivalence was found in several key areas, but in other areas Romanian
expropriation laws and procedures were not considered equivalent to principles in OPBP 4.00,
notably with regard to informing affected people o f their rights and monitoring or assessment o f
the impacts o f expropriation. Regarding acceptability, it was found that that the expropriation
process inRomania is implemented according to the law and i s markedly consistent with OPBP
4.00. However, some weaknesses would have had to be addressed to enable piloting under
OP4.00 o f this policy, that were largely related to lack o f transparency in the valuation and
negotiation process, and little track record with regards to dealing with more complicated issues
such as impacts on livelihoods and illegal occupation.

PrincipalObservations-OtherIssues

There i s no information at this stage to indicate that other safeguard-related policy areas that fall
within the scope o f OP 4.00 will be triggered by the proposed MSP and Transport projects.
Accordingly, no other safeguard policy areas are considered for piloting.

Conclusions

The Bank believes that the Romanian system o f laws, regulations andpractices inthe sub-sectors
to be supported by the proposed Transport Sector Support project can be considered equivalent
to those o f the World Bank, and acceptable inpractice, and support piloting under OPBP 4.00 in
two safeguards-related areas. These areas are environmental assessment and cultural property,
and require no gap-filling.

World Bank supervision on safeguard-related              matters will continue throughout the
implementation o f the two proposed projects to: (i)      ensure compliance with "equivalent and
acceptable" Romanian procedures, (ii) implementation o f gap-filling measures, (iii)
                                         assess                                               ensure
compliance with Bank policies if7where they apply inlieu o fRomanian systems, and (iv) looking
more broadly, track results in terms o f environmental and social development outcomes. This
will include review o fmonitoringreports as agreed with the borrower.
