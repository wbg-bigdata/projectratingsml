GEORGIA
Forests Development Project (P044800)
PROJECT SUMlMARY
The Project is proposed to be financed in 2002-2007 by an IDA credit of US$20 million. It is closely linked
and coordinated with the Protected Areas Development Project (GEF grant of US$S8.7 million).
PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND COMPONENTS
The main objective of the Project is to establish sound forest management systems that would maximize the
contribution of Georgia's forests to economic development and rural poverty reduction on an environmentally
sustainable basis.
The Project is of critical importance to Georgia's forests and people. With the enactment of the new Forest
Code of Georgia (June 1999). Georgia has adopted a legal framework and roadmap for transition to market
principles of forest economy, including its possible privatization, while safeguarding the critical environmental,
social and cultural functions of the nation's forests. The Project is designed to provide critical support to this
ambitious transition.
The Project is expected to be implemented over a period of 5 to 6 years and will include the following five
components:

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Component A "Support to National Forest Policy Formulation and Implementation" (US$6.8 million).
Under this component, investments would be made in improving the capacity of the Government of Georgia (GOG)
for forest sector analysis, planning and policy formulation, completing the legislation for implementation of the new
Forest Code, designing and carrying out appropriate institutional, governance and financial reform in the sector,
training of public officials, and raising public awareness in the objectives of the national forest policy.
In particular, this component would support the State Forestry Department (SFD) and other relevant agencies
in: (i) finalization and public discussion of new forest regulations supporting implementation of the 1999 Forest
Code of Georgia; (ii) development and implementation of a forestry institutional reorganization plan; (iii)
development and implementation of a forestry financial system reform plan; (iv) preparation and public discussion of
the National Forest Policy and Strategy and the draft law "On Privatization of State Forests in Georgia". A cohesive
system of implementing regulations would form initial basis for further forest governance reforms and forest policy
formulation. Given this priority, development and discussion of regulations is already carried out under the PPF
financing, while the privatization law and national policy would be finalized at the later stages of the project. The
2



development of the financial system reform plan is also already being financed though the PPF; it would be based on
the overall assessment of the national forest resources, evaluation of the governance, transparency and capacity of
the private sector in forestry, evaluation of the market prospects for wood and non-wood products, and analysis of all
public revenues from forestry, including the setting of stumpage values and the organization of auction systems. The
component would then support implementation of this plan, specifically by setting up a Forest Management
Information System (FMIS) and training the SFD and core ministries' staff in operating it. The development of an
institutional reorganization plan (also financed under the PPF) would lay ground for strengthening normative and
regulatory functions of the SFD, rationalizing central and field capacity for its forest management planning and
oversight responsibilities and proper coordination with other line agencies, private sector, communities, and civil
society. In addition to restructuring the central office, the existing 54 district offices would be replaced with two
regional offices and 36 range offices. The component would then provide all the necessary technical assistance,
training and incremental logistical means (mainly building rehabilitation, transportation, equipment/materials) to
implement this plan. Overall, the most critical elements of this component (development of implementing
regulations and reform planning) are financed up-front through the PPF phase (see Box 1 for a summary of activities
financed in 2000-2001 by the PPF credit advance of US$0.99 million).
Component B "Support to Efficient and Participatory Forest Management Planning" (US$3.3 million).
Under this component, investments would be made in improving the quality of forest assessment and inventory
carried out by the SFD, introduction of integrated forest conservation and utilization planning techniques on a
landscape-ecological basis, enabling transparent access to forest management planning process and facilitating public
participation it in.
In particular, this component would support: (i) a total economic valuation cf Georgian forests; (ii)
preparation of an improved forest inventory for a model forest area of the Central Caucasus Planning Area
("laboratory zone" - four districts over around 460,000 ha); in the Central Caucasus; (iii) preparation of model land-
use and forest management plans for the above areas; and (iv) promotion of public awareness in sustainable forest
management through participatory management planning for community and local forests. These activities would be
implemented jointly and in coordination with the planning component of the GEF-financed Protected Areas
Development Project. The underlying landscape-ecological planning techniques have already been developed using
Japanese grant funding under the preparation phase and the field testing, and an initial inventory of 100,000 ha
(together with provision of equipment and aerial photography) is being carried out with PPF financing. The
component would then support provision of additional equipment, surveys and training to replicate improved
inventory and planning on a significant scale outside of the laboratory zone, and additional facilities and equipment
for information dissenmination.
Component C "Support to Effective Forest Protection and Afforestation " (US$9.5 million). Under this
component, investments would be made in forest protection and afforestation of the most critically degraded forest
areas near population centers through improvements in technical capacity of local forest management units and
development of public works in community-based forestry.
In particular, this component would support: (i) improved seed production/processing and nursery
development, (ii) carrying out an afforestation program over about 3,100 ha, and (iii) carrying out a forest restoration
program over about 5,600 ha in the priority zone around Tbilisi. Seed processing and testing operations will be
brought together under one existing Seed Centre that will be upgraded. An existing nursery in the priority zone will
be expanded/upgraded and used for supplying quality seedlings for afforestation and forest restoration, and as a
model for replication in other districts. The afforestation and restoration programs will take place in the priority
zone using a combination of community-managed public works and, where appropriate, private contractors using
more cost-efficient techniques. These actions will result in the SFD having significantly increased its capacity for
collecting, processing and testing quality seeds and producing quality seedlings. They would also facilitate a phased
development of community-managed forestry in Georgia (to be supported by parallel donor financing). Moreover,
around 40% of the erosion-prone areas in the priority zone will be afforested and 10% of the degraded areas restored.
Component D "Promotion of Private Sector Participation in Sustainable Forest Management" (US$6.0
million). Under this component, investments would be made in development, demonstration, certification and
promotion of sustainable forest harvesting and transportation standards and techniques, so as to facilitate the
emergence of private sector operators in forestry, as well as in the development of non-wood forest products, hunting
and ecotourism on an environmentally sustainable basis.
3



This component would significantly draw on the technical assistance provided under Component A towards
development of the draft law "On Pnrvatization of State Forests in Georgia" where the parts of the national legal and
fiscal systems dealing with the possible operations of private businesses in forestrv will be revised, simplified and
made more stimulating for entrepreneurs. In particular, this component would support setting up a privately-run
Business Support Association. The Association would be set up on a full cost-recovery basis and would provide
demand-driven support services to interested entrepreneurs (e.g. training in book keeping and management, market
intelligence, certification of products and systems and transfer of improved technologies). The Association would be
initially operated under contract by the private sector that would eventually be expected to take it over and convert it
into a private entity. Furthermore, upon completion of the improved forest management plan in a suitable area of the
Central Caucasus 'laboratory zone', the component would support there a privately-run demonstration program of
improved, low-impact harvesting and transportation systems and a forest road rehabilitation/construction public
program. The program should result in a growing use by private entrepreneurs of independently certified techniques,
processes and equipment that are more cost-efficient and environment-friendly. Moreover, the forest road network
inside the laboratory zone will be significantly improved through the operation of the road construction unit included
as part of the demonstration program introducing improved transportation systems. In addition, the road
rehabilitation/construction works under the public program - contracted out to private entrepreneurs - will cover
about 225 km outside of the laboratory zone. Lastly, the component would support preparation of a strategy for
promoting non-wood forest products and carrying out pilot investments in 2 or 3 selected sites. The component's
support should result in increased sales and exports of wood and non-wood products from the private sector and in a
greater involvement of the entrepreneurs in the carrying out of forestry operations.
Component E "Project Management" (US$1.4 million). This component would support overall project
administration and provide to the SFD staff hands-on training and technology transfer in project development and
implementation, application of fiduciary and anti-corruption safeguards. A number of critical capacity building
steps, including setting up the project management unit, training in implementation and procurement planning,
monitoring & evaluation, financial management systems, etc. - is being financed up-front under the PPF phase (see
Box I).
IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
The preparation and implementation of the Project is administered by the Forest Sector Development Center
(FSDC) - a legal body of civil law established by the decree of the President of Georgia on October 29, 2000. FSDC
operates under the overall guidance of a Supervisory Board appointed by the President of Georgia. The Supervisory
Board is chaired by a member of the Parliament of Georgia and comprised of officials of the key interested
ministries and presidential administration, with participation of the academnic and NGO community. (To ensure
proper coordination between this project and the GEF-funded Protected Areas Development Project, a significant
overlap is ensured in the membership of their respective Supervisory Boards.) FSDC is headed by the Project
Director selected in an open tender by a selection conmmission and approved by the President of Georgia. FSDC
reports to the Ministry of Finance of Georgia on financial matters and to the Georgian State Department of Forest
Management on technical matters.

Box 1. Summary of PPF-funded Project Activities
The Government of Georgia has already borrowed US$0.99 million of IDA funds through a PPF
credit advance to implement in 2000-2001 the following subset of front-loaded project activities:
(1)    Development of improved forest policies and regulations, including (i) finalization and
public discussion of new forest regulations supporting implementation of the 1999 Forest
Code of Georgia; (ii) development of a forestry institutional reorganization plan; and (iii)
development of a forestry financial system reform plan;
(2)    Development of improved forest management planning and protection techniques,
including (i) total economic valuation of Georgian forests; (ii) methodology of improved
forest inventory on a landscape-ecological basis in a model forest area in the Central
Caucasus; (iii) participatory management planning for community forests; and (iv)
promotion of public awareness in sustainable forest management;
(3)    Project implementation capacity building, including (i) setting up a project management
unit; (ii) preparation of detailed project implementation, procurement and monitoring and
evaluation plans, financial management systems, including project advisory and audit
services; and (iii) training of project management unit staff.
Up-front implementation of these project activities under the PPF would generate immediate and
sustained benefits to Georgia on their own merit and would also provide favorable conditions for start-up
and efficient implementation of follow-on project activities and increase their developmental impact.

Georgia: Forests Development Project
Project Development Objective
The objective of the project is to establish sustainable forest management systems, which would
maximize the contribution of Georgia's forests to economic development and rural poverty reduction on
an environmentally sustainable basis.
Project Description Summarv
The project would support implementation of national regulatory and financial reforms in the forest
sector and capacity building in the State Forestry Department and other agencies dealing with the forest
sector: sustainable forest planning and management in demonstration areas, which would serve for
replication, and support reforestation in degraded areas.
1. National Regulatory and Financial Reforms: The project would complete the institutional and
regulatory reforms initiated with PPF financing, and would support:
a)  Finalization of the forest regulatory framework, including finalization if the subsidiary
regulations for proper implementation of the new Forest Code and their harmonization with
environmental, budgetary and tax legislation, redefinition of institutional functions of agencies
related to the forest sector. This would include development of regulations for the transfer and
management of community forests. There would be widespread public discussion of these draft
regulations before they are finalized.
The ongoing transition in Georgia from a centrally planned to a market economy is proving
difficult to achieve, particularly in the forestry sector where environmental considerations (a
public concern) are very important.  Within the framework of the existing National
Environmental Action Plan, a National Forestry Strategy was prepared in 1997 by a Georgian
governmental team with assistance from the World Bank's Institutional Development Fund. The
main objectives of the strategy are to maximize the environmental/economic benefits derived
from the forests while encouraging the privatization of forestry activities to the extend possible.
It is indicated that reform should be carried out in four ways:
i)  to make possible the development of sustainable forestry development,
ii) to elaborate financial! economic management methods,
iii) to integrate the forestry institutions in the general economic reform,
iv) to interest international community in supporting forestry development.
Although the strategy contains very valid elements, such as the necessity to improve land-use
planning as well as the overall management of the state forests, there is still a need for further
analytical work (clarification /prioritization). In order to obtain fully operational document it is
also important public participation in its preparation and implementation.
Forest Code of Georgia has been approved by the Parliament in 1999, it is a foundation for
institutional and policy reforms in the sector, it provides the legal basis for the organization,
management and financing of the sector. In order to enact the Forest Code, various
supplementary normative acts and regulations have to be prepared. Preparation of regulations
listed below will be a guarantee for sustainable forest management and wood resource
utilization.
I . On authorization of local governing and self governing bodies for managing the local forest
fund and procedures for separating the local forest fund from state forest fund;
2.  On procedures for allocating designated area of the state forest fund and regulations for
permitting forest use, permitting, restricted forest use and banning forest use in this area;
3.  On setting boundaries of the usable state forest fund;
4.  On the system of registry of the state forest fund;
5.  On special requirements for registering protected areas of the state forest fund;
6.  On authorized issuance of biological and chemical preparations to the physical and legal
bodies with the purpose of forest protection;
2



7.  On regulations and methods of inventory of animal wildlife in the specific areas of the state
forest fund;
8.  On the listing of biological, chemical and generic interventions permitted for the purposes
of forest protection;
9.  On selection and use of plant species for restoring and expanding the state forest fund;
10 On calculating and recovering losses born by the state forest fund due to illegal forest use:
I I On regulations for using non-wood resources of the state forest fund:
12  On regulations for accounting for the state forest fund;
13  On informnation on the state forest fund and its disclosure to the State Department of
Forestry;
14 On regulations for forest protection;
15 On regulations for defining the annual allowable cut;
16 On regulations for producing timber and the secondary wood products;
17 On general regulations for carrying out scientific research and educational activities in the
territory of the state forest fund;
18 On preparing documentation for issuing forest use tickets, including calculations of costs
required for allocating cutting areas and setting regulations for recovery of these costs.
b) Revision of financial and tax regulations, including 1. Revision of the principles and amount of
financing the State Department and other governmental agencies related to the forest sector and
identification of the financial resources dispersed in different institutions and intended for the
implementation of the same functions. Return these revenues and other existing income and use
them to carry out forest protection and management. 2.Revision of forest resource pricing
principles and methodologies, including stumpage regulations in order to differentiate by
quality and provide stronger incentives for resource conservation; 3.Implementation of
administrative regulations in order to carry out forests activities based on the sustainable
management principles and allow for better tracking of timber harvesting and export.
According to the present day Budget and Tax laws all stumpage fees collected from the State
Forest Fund are directed to local budgets. The Tax Law states that the purpose of adoption of
those taxes is the provision of financing of the measures for protection and restoration-
reproduction of nature resources. But neither of the legislation act defines its complete
percentage volume and the rule of its returning to local forestry. Hence the local authorities do
not transfer the above stated income to the adequate body and use it for their local need.
It is necessary to move new introductions to the Budget and Tax Codes and Laws. It will ensure
partly return (40-50%) of forest use tax payment to the local forestry.
The calculation and differentiation of forests timber resources stumpage fees need to be studied
and regulated. At present it is based on the product market price and is differentiated according
to the timber size and the distance between the timber produce place and the nearest railway
station. Today the prices are not transparent, in addition the of goods transportation by road is
more developed than by railway.
Division of forest timber resources needs to be improved. The rule of carrying out of Auction
and fixed price systems are among them. This will stimulate local forest enterprises
development/broadening. The mechanisms of price formation should be elaborated.
Forest resources economical evaluation is envisaged by the project. It gives us possibility of
state forest fund total evaluation, of registration non-timber resources procuring and usage and
support non-timber resources evaluation and their involvement into the local forestry income
and Georgian budget.
The following activities should be done:
* To revise existing legislative base in order to carry out Georgian financial policy (the
Georgian law of State budget, Tax Code, Forest Code and other under law normative
acts);
3



*   Financing of different govemmental institutions related to the forest management and
State control from the State budget and identify the financial resources dispersed in
these institutions and intended for the implementation of the same functions.
*   To revise the indicative plan of Georgian economical development in connection with
the forest sector:
*   To revise the regional (local) socio-economic development plan,
*   To revise the branch structure of regional economics;
*   To define the part of the forest sector in Georgian total inner product;
*   To define the part of the forest sector in commodity circulation;
*   To study the price formation on the main forest products;
*   To study the forest products market and trade conditions;
*   To revise tariffs, taxes, licenses. quota, "special tickets" etc.
*   To study the import-export balance;
*   To define the methods of registration of the forest sector income;
*   To revise the forest sector expenses (direct and indirect), income, currency flow,
financing, liquidity, financial reports and the mechanisms of financial control;
*   To study the methods of marketing;
*   To define the participation of the private sector in forest activities;
*   To analyze the financial activities of enterprises engaged in the forest sector;
*   To evaluate Georgian investing environment;
c)  A national public education and awareness campaign to engage the public about the challenges
facing the forest sector to help finalize the new national forest policy and strategy. The project
would support equipment, TV, newspaper and other mass media campaigns, consultancy
services and training for development of the program, workshops, and a hotline for the local
population to send proposals for better forest management.
According to social researches there is a high interest of society to participate in forest resources
management. Unfortunately, most of people are not aware of their legal rights. Because of lack
of information and appropriate knowledge, people try to show their displeasure often in illegal
ways (blocking roads etc) and as a rule they react on the results, not on the reasons causing
these results. The public control is spontaneous and ineffective. Thus the most part of society
prefer to be passive and inert as they see the ineffectiveness of fighting against the illegal
actions in forest sector.
It is for the first time that the new Forest Code allows participation of population and public
association in the management of the State Forest Fund. According to the Code the issues of
regulation of Forest Inventory, division of The State Forest Fund into categories, define the
regime of protection of territories of the State Forest Funds, transfer of the State Forest Fund for
a tern of 5 years for temporary use, as well as the accessibility of the information about
condition of the State Forest resources have been guaranteed less the cases stipulated by the
legislation of Georgia.
With the purpose of ensuring the publicity the Project plans to elaborate adequate programs, to
organize " hot " line in Tbilisi, to use mass media and NGO for informing the wide masses of
local population and for finding out their opinion. With this purpose it is planned to create a
center favoring the publicity in the Oni region, which through seminars, meetings and
conferences will investigate the opinion of the local population about current situation in forests
and about forest using, will provide attraction of masses in elaboration of plans of management
of local forestry. The training will be organized for elaboration of the programs.
d)  Elaboration of the national standards of forestry certification.
The existing situation in Georgian forests needs to be changed, one way is to implement the
forestry certification in the forestry sector according to the world standards. This system will
help to prevent illegal timber harvesting, decrease forest damages during forest use processes,
eliminate illegal timber export, support the implementation of sustainable forest management
principles and development of the legal timber trade market mechanisms.
The State institutions of the forestry sector and different non governmental organizations
consider that among the certification systems existing in the world, the most suitable for
4



Georgia is FSC certification system as it have more environmental demands, which are very
important for Georgian forests, having water regulative, soil protective and other unique
properties.
At present where is no such standards in Georgia and the initiative group who has started
independently elaborating them is facing financial and other problems.
The State structures of the forest sector, ministries of economic and environment and the
president of Georgia have supported forest certification and expressed their readiness to assist in
this activity. The implementation of this component is envisaged by the project. For this
purpose it is necessary to form a 3 member unit, equip them with the office space, computer and
supply with special literature. Operational costs of the unit should be include in the project.
g)  The objective of the forest sector reorganization plan is to provide with a detailed, phased and
costed plan for the future role, restructuring and strategic development of the SFD, which will
be a guarantee of the Georgian forests protection, management based on the sustainable
development principles and increase forests economic efficiency. Necessary studies will be
carry out for obtaining a better understanding of the forest department's present role,
management and main activity functions, financial policy of the branch, institutional
possibilities and operational activities with identification of the future optimal scenario on the
central and regional level. The study should be also done to identify the role and duties of the
forestry related state organizations in the field of forest protection, management and state
control. This will include forest department's public purpose activities, not core activities that
could be privatized.
It is supposed to unify the regional forest offices with their resources and forestry activities. The
public juridical body will be established based on the several forestry. The project will create
the necessary material-technical base and be responsible for the reorganized forestry staff
training (carry out building rehabilitation, supply with communicative facilities, office furniture
and techniques).
Setting up the Forestry Management Information System stage by stage is envisaged by the
project. The outputs will be a fully operational FMIS systematizing all forest sector information
and carrying out the monitoring.
h)  Under the project it is foreseen to merge the forest protection Unit and Forest Inspection under
the State Department of Forestry and set up a Unit of Forest Protection and Operational Service.
It is assumed that the mobile group comprising ten members will be responsible for
controlling/inspecting and monitoring the forest operations at national level. The group will
periodically visit the regional offices (including the visits based on the signals received from the
local population), in order to inspect the operational activities carried out by the regional
officers in accordance with the Forest Code, Cutting rules and other normative acts. Besides the
unit will be obliged to reveal and react on all the violations regarding the wood utilization and
forest management. For efficient functioning, it is critical that the unit was well equipped,
particularly the unit should have one four-wheel drive vehicles for field visits, 5 mobile phones
for communication, uniforms and one computer for putting all data into and for monitoring.
2. Improved forest Planning and Management in Central Caucasus Pilot Area
a) The elaboration of the forest management updated plans is foreseen under the project. These
plans will improve forest sector organizational, financial, operational and commercial efficiency
and optimize its contribution to the total inner product of Georgia. The following activities
should be done:
*   Elaboration of the new improved forest inventory methodology based on the landscape-
ecological and SFM principles. The methodology must consider socio-economical and
ecological aspects. Carry out the Forests inventory, using the new methodology in Oni
lab.zone first.
*   Elaboration of the total forests economical evaluation methodology and  testing stage
by stage in lab. Zone forests after inventory.
5



*   Finally, after inventory and total economical evaluation of the forests we will have all
information about resources in lab. zone. It will give possibility to elaborate fully
operational forest management plans.
*   The forest management information centre will be an instrument for the implementation
of forest policies and will help to increase production from State- forested lands through
new forest management plans. Using the information system in the lab. zone the proper
computer program and its effectiveness will be identified
b)  The construction and rehabilitation of the forest roads is envisaged by the project. Amortization
of old roads and lack of new ones have done ecological and economical harm to forests and the
country.
Georgian forests are rich in timber and non-timber resources. It is very important to use these
resources effectively and increase the role of forest sector in the countries total inner product. In
this case all ecological aspects of sustainable forest management principles should be taken into
consideration. In particular the lack of road network causes the press of population on the
nearest forests. Which is the main reason of the forests distraction.
For using natural resources, without destroying ecological balance it is necessary to construct
new roads in the forests. To conduct forest tending, protection and other forest management
activities it is also important to rehabilitate the existing road net-work.
The planned construction of new roads and rehabilitation of existing roads in the Lab-Zone is
45 and 150 km respectively. Geological materials about rock stability as well as updated
machinery will be used during constructing new roads to prevent serious damage of the forest
ecosystem.
c)  Support to improved forest silvicultural operations.
The project envisages the implementation and demonstration of the ecologically improved
cutting machinery and cable logging system. Using these systems The Forest Sector will be able
to produce timber on the 30-35 degree forest fund slopes without destroying it. Under the
project it is foreseen to exam them in the "real" situation, in the lab.zone (2-3 region) and
define the real costs and profits in the connection to the existing situation.
As a result the private sector should study and use these systems.
d)  Forest protection. 43% of Georgia's total territory are forest areas. 39,6% are actually covered
with forests. Georgian forests are constantly threatened by destructive agents such as fire, wind,
insects disease and illegal cutting. Three agents: illegal cutting, forest fires and spreading insect
disease were indicated as the main factor of forest losses over the past decade. Together these
account for forest losses averaging 3 million Lari. Losses due to pests account for 84% of this
sum. The Georgian forest management seriously suffers from the insect and disease. They cause
different type of damages such as total defoliation, producing physiological stress and decrease
the timber thickness process, local and dispersed type of withering on the large areas of forests.
In nurseries pests diseases often fully destroy nurseries and decrease outputs of standard
seedlings.
In Georgian forest management system the most spreaded pests diseases are: Ips typofgaphus,
Dendroctonus micans, Ocneria dispar, Nymia phacorrehoea etc. The development of the leaves
and needles eating pest are the reason of their withering. Pests diseases have damaged fir, pine,
chestnut, oak and beech stands in Georgia.
Under the project it is foreseen to study in details pests damaged forest areas, pests spreading
dynamics over past five years, define the types of pests and reasons of their appearance,
prognosticate pests spreading areas and elaborate effective pests preventive activities. It is also
envisaged by this project the restoration-renovation of the pest control laboratory where the
methods of the concrete pest preventive activities will be identified,tested and certified
(satisfactory to the criteria of the policy of GoG and the WB).
The project will pay much attention to the problems of physical protection, which are very
important and actual. At present the forest protection workers of forest management system
have not enough knowledge of the Forest Code's laws and rules. They are enable to use them in
everyday life. Insufficient financial support, lack of equipment and labor power force local
people to use forest properties (legal and illegal harvesting of timber) and satisfy their
elementary needs. This leads to irregular and unsustainable forest use and forests degradation.
6



Under the project it is foreseen to equip forest protection workers of the forest management
system with beepers, uniforms, means of conveyance and communication. It is also envisaged to
set up barriers and observation points for control and monitoring.
e) Support to private sector development of non-timber forest products.
The advertisement of non-timber production, hunting and ecotourism is envisaged by the
project. The investment would be implemented in the following actions:
I .   To elaborate the strategy of non-timber products for advertising and for experimental
investments implementation;
2.   To inventory of the lab.zone Wild Life and elaborate the hunting strategy;
3.   To identify the objects of ecotourism and define the model object in the lab.zone;
For these purposes under the project it is foreseen to implemented two business supporting
centers in Oni and Mestia.
f) Support to communal forest management
It should be noted that in 1995 the Georgian Parliament approved the resolution " On Usable
and Municipal forests" (No 671-11 7.3.1995) to improve forests tending/protection activities.
According to this regulation The Cabinet of Ministry had to transfer to the management above
mentioned forests land to the SDFM.
The process became drawling and from 5165000 ha former "Kolxoz" forests land 3326000 ha
(64%) is transfared to the forest department up-to-date: Including 172000 ha former "kolxoz"
land examined and legally affirmed by the State Committee of Land Management Use and
Protection in Oni region and 3154000 ha forest land transferred to the regional self governing
bodies without material-technical base and demarcation procedures.
1839000ha is left without supervision. Former "kolxoz"forest land is mainly located near the
local population and they use the forests illegally as the source of income, food and energy
(firewood).
According to the Forest Code (adopted in 1999) the Local Forest Fund is defined as a part of the
State Usable Forest Fund. The juridical relationship on this matter is regulated by the local
governing and self governing bodies based on the Georgian legislation and the Forest Code.
The rights of the local governing and self goveming bodies in local forest fund managing is not
defined. The preparation of the project of the Georgian President decree " on authorization of
local governing and self governing bodies for managing the Local Forest Fund and procedures
for separating the Local Forest Fund from the State Forest Fund " is envisaged by the project.
At present the KFW is financing the establishment of the Municipal forests based on the
Borjomi- Kharagauli National Park nearby forests.
3  Forests Restoration -Afforestation in Degraded areas.
The Forests Restoration-Afforestation program envisages to provide nurseries with seed of
adequate quantity, species and quality. The nurseries from their side will have enough quality,
quantity and seedlings for forests afforestation-restoration.
A) Seed collection, processing and storage
To obtain the adequate quantity and quality seed the following activities should be done:
*   Tools for cleaning undergrowth and improving access to existing seed production
stands;
*   Small storage shelters in each seed production stand;
*   Ladders and hand tools to improve cone collection;
*   Small tractors to collect and transporting cones to forest roads;
* Renovation of the former seed processing buildings;
*   Renovation of selected items of seed processing equipment;
*   Equipment and materials for drying, packaging and dewing seeds;
*   Set up procedures for testing and certification of forest tree seed;
*   Buy the laboratory equipment for seed testing and certification;
7



B) The renovation of the Sartichala central forest nursery including irrigation system is envisaged
by this project. The credit will finance nursery operating and maintenance costs at the first
stages. Improved forest nursery will produce high quality seed and seedling for afforestation -
renovation works and for individuals. Soon the nursery should be able to cover its costs for
labor, machinery and for reinvestment in technological improvements. The long-term goal is
to privatize the nursery.
C) Georgian forests are rich in forest resources
3-3) Georgia is rich in forest resources. However, a large part of the State forests are located
on mountain slopes. Socio-economical problems which developed in Georgia during the last
period, different negative events ( illegal cutting for fuel wood production, livestock in the
forests etc.) and climate problems have effected on the forests degradation and soil erosion
and subsequently on the agricultural productivity. Afforestation programs should be re-
commenced and focused on erosion-prone areas. The region selected for these works, consists
of nine the most damaged districts within a 50 km radius of Tbilisi - "priority zone" where
the 3100 ha erosion and 5600 ha degraded areas are foreseen to be afforestate.
4.  Project management and monitoring.
The preparation and implementation of the Project is administrated by the Forest Sector
Development Center (FSDC)- a legal body of civil law established by IDA Q212-) GE agreement
and by the decree No 469 of the president of Georgia. FSDC is operate under the overall guidance
of a Supervisory Board appointed by the President of Georgia. The Supervisory Board is chaired by
the Chairman of the committee of National Resources and Environment Protection of the
Parliament of Georgia and comprised of officials of the key interested ministries and academic and
NGO community. The FDSC is headed by the Project Director and has six member staff: Technical
Manager, Procurement Specialist, Financial Manager, Accountant, Secretary-Translator and
Operational Assistant. The FSDC will report to the Georgian State Department of Forest
Management on technical matters and to the Ministry of Finance of Georgia on Financial matters.
The FSDC or the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will elaborate the detailed plans of
Procurement, monitoring, and evaluation, necessary for implementation of the project and will be
responsible for exact fulfillment of these plans and the WB procurement procedures. The PIU will
provide financial management system satisfactory to the WB. With this system all financial and
accounting operations will be carried out, according to demands of the WB and the local bank,
where the special account of the project will be held.
The PIU will collaborate with the State Forest Department. Special training, envisaged by the
project, will help the department staff to be familiar with the WB project implementation,
management, and procurement procedures. The project will finance the PIU members training in
project implementation procedures, Bank project management approaches, special computer
programs and language, PIU office refurbishment, office furniture, financial management computer
programs installation and service and operational costs.

1. Country and Sector Background
Georgia is a mountainous country of 5.5 million people, 40% of whom are rural dwellers, with a rich cultural history
and a long tradition of respect for their natural heritage. The economy deteriorated after independence, and
although the reform agenda is quite well advanced and the economy is growing, per capita GDP (US$970) is still
well below pre-1990 levels. Georgia's climate and topography are varied, with rainfall between 600 and 4000 mm
per annum and elevations rising to 5000 m. 2.75 million ha (40% of its land area of 70,000 km2) is forested, of
which 2.2 million ha are classified as state forests. (24% is classified as pasture land, 11 % as arable land and 5%
horticulture and tree crops). Deciduous forest species predominate, including beech (Fagus orientalis), which
comprises nearly half of the forest area, oak (mostly Quercus iberica), hombeam (Carpinus caucasica), alder
(Alnus glutinosa) and chestnut (Castanea sativa). Conifers including spruce (Picea orientalis), firs (Abies
nordmanniana) and pines (Pinus sosnowskyi). Standing wood is estimated at 434 million m3, or more than 80 m3
per person, three times the European average. Much of the forest land is located on the slopes of the biodiversity-
rich Caucasus mountains (included in WWF's Global 200 priority ecosystems) and serve a protective function for
soil and water in these erosion-prone areas. Only about 20% of forest area is classified as production forest.
Forests thus play a key role in watershed protection and are rich in biodiversity; the forests include over 4000
vascular plant species and 573 vertebrates. Georgians have a long tradition of respect for their natural heritage.
The forest sector is especially complex because of the broader importance forests play in the social, cultural and
economic life of Georgia. Many of the country's historical and cultural sites are found in forests. Georgia's forests
were intensively harvested for industrial purposes from the 1930s to the 1960s. Forest policy was then changed,
and the forests were managed largely for protection (72%) and recreation (24%) during the Soviet period. The
Georgian wood industry benefited from low-cost imports of fimber from remote areas of Russia. Since the
beginning of the transition the situation has changed. Poverty increased as GDP declined sharply following
independence, and phasing out energy subsidies for fossil fuels has led to pressure on the forests for fuel-wood.
The loss of cheap wood imports has led timber processors to harvest Georgian forests. Revenues from forest
tourism have declined. And Georgian logs have been exported to Turkey, in many cases illegally for very low
prices. Finally, the Georgian forest management agency has faced declining budgets and real salaries for forest
management and protection. Georgia thus faces major challenges in managing its forests to take account of the
new economic circumstances, while balancing the economic, ecological and social demands on its forest
resources in a way, which contributes both to sustainable management and to broad-based economic growth and
job creation. It is estimated that annual sustainable forest harvest, with good management, can be well over 1.5
million m3 compared with the total harvest presently estimated at 0.8 million m3 (of which 0.43 million m3, or about
52%, is estimated to be unofficial harvest). However, the issue is not the overall level of harvest, but harvesting
methods at local level, especially with widespread uncontrolled harvesting, which are wasteful and do not always
follow principles of biologically sustainable management and regeneration. Approximately 77% of the harvest is
used currently for fuelwood and 23% for Umber products. Harvesting and processing have been privatized. With
more adequate forest management systems in place, the level of unregulated harvest could decrease
2



substantially, and there could be much higher value added from commercial-grade timber. Almost all forest land is
owned by the State. The State Forestry Department, with a staff of 3,300 mostly located in the field, is responsible
for forest policy and management. Revenues from harvesting are transferred to the Treasury. Most revenues are
used by District authorities for education and other expenditures, and budgetary allocation from the Ministry of
Finance to the State Forestry Department is insufficient for adequate forest management, in tum reducing further
forest revenues. A revision of forest financing policy is necessary. Forest inventories and management plans were
prepared according to a 1 0-year rolling program, but the planning process needs to be revised to take into account
the new socioeconomic environment. It is estimated that only 0.5 million ha (17%) of the forest estate have
updated forest management plans. About 0.5 million ha of forest were managed by agricultural collective farms
(former kolkhozes), and the intention is to transfer them to local communities (sakrebulo); in these areas, close to
villages, forest degradation is generally worse than in forests managed by the state. A further issue concerns
forest management around urban areas, where land use planning must be undertaken together with other
government agencies, and management for local recreation is especially important. Partly because most Georgian
forests were managed for protection, the protected area network is presently insufficient. It comprises 2.7% of the
land area, and has been managed primarily for research purposes, rather than to assure sustainable conservation
management addressing local as well as global and scientific interests.  Protected areas, many in forest
ecosystems, are the responsibility of the State Department of Protected Areas, Reserves and Hunting. While
collaboration with the State Forestry Department is good at local level, there have sometimes been difficulties at
national level.
The Georgian authorities are well aware of the recent difficulties. They have prepared a forest strategy in 1996,
which emphasized the need to manage the change from a forest management regime oriented towards
conservation to one which balances conservation and sustainable use. They have prepared a Biodiversity Strategy
and Action Plan. The recently completed National Environmental Action Plan also includes improved forest
management as a priority. And the recently approved GEF Protected Area Management Project supports the
strengthening of the protected area system. The authorities have, in collaboration with a range of stakeholders,
prepared and adopted a new Forest Code (1999). Its major innovations include: (1) defining the principles of
protection, sustainable development, and management of the forests of Georgia on the basis of the 1992 Rio
Declaration (i.e. proclaiming focus on multiple use of forests and its environmental, economic, social, and cultural
dimensions); and (2) allowing for multiple forms of forest ownership (state, municipal/community, church, and
private). The Code also allowed for long-term lease of forests and privatization of forest management activities.
Delineation of regulatory and oversight responsibilities between the State Forestry Department and the Ministry of
Environment was improved. However, further work is needed to make the Code operational and transparent. Many
of its important regulatory provisions are not yet effectively applied (due to lack of implementing regulations and
the public finance crisis), there remains strong political pressure to reintroduce a temporary ban on commercial
logging and on log exports (lifted with enactment of the Forest Code in 1999).Georgia has also borrowed an
advance of US$0.99 million under the Bank's PPF (project preparation facility) in order to elaborate the regulations
to permit implementation of the Forest Code, and develop concrete plans for forest sector institutional
reorganization and financial reforms. The PPF has also financed elaboration of improved forest inventory
methodologies, promotion of public awareness in forest management, as well as project preparation. Georgia has
also collaborated with FAO and a range of bilateral organizations and NGOs to discuss and review forest
management alternatives. With WWF they have undertaken steps to increase public awareness of the principles of
sustainable forest management (including options for forest certification). With the German KfW and French GEF,
they are preparing a pilot project to test community-based approaches to forest management in areas near
densely populated rural settlements. Aware of the broad social and environmental values of forests, the Georgian
authorities have also participated in a preliminary "total economic valuation" (TEV) of Georgia's forests supported
by the Bank; the exercise when complete will estimate the broad range of "use" and "non-use' values of the
forests. There is strong political commitment to manage Georgia's forests sustainably, for the benefit of society as
broadly defined.
2. Objectives
The main objective of the project is to establish sound forest management systems which would maximize the
contribution of Georgia's forests to economic development and rural poverty reduction on an environmentally
sustainable basis.
3



3. Rationale for Bank's Involvement
The Govemment of Georgia has sought Bank assistance and advice in the forest policy debate since 1996. The
Forest Strategy was prepared with the assistance of an IDF grant, and the Biodiversity Strategy with a GEF grant,
the GEF-financed Coastal Zone Management Project includes support for improved management of fragile lowland
forests, and the Protected Areas project addresses conservation of forest ecosystems. The Bank has been able to
encourage and convene forest policy debates at both technical and at political level. Forestry issues related to
trade have been part of the ongoing debate of economic reform. The Bank has also facilitated improved
coordination between the environmental and the forest management interests in Georgia, balancing conservation
and sustainable development. It has been able to bring its experience with forest reform in other transition
economies (e.g. Croatia, Poland, Bosnia, Romania, Russia, Albania) to assist with the debate in Georgia. The
Bank-wide forest-policy review which is nearing completion, and a number of new initiatives in forestry (e.g. the
World Wildlife Fund/World Bank Alliance for Forest Conservation and Sustainable Use, the Prototype Carbon
Fund) is also facilitating a transfer of experiences from other countries. The World Bank is also in a unique
position in its ability to relate forest sector issues to IMF-discussions with the Government, the overall economic
reform agenda, and other inter-sectoral issues (e.g. energy, environment) through the CAS.
4. Description
The project would support implementation of national regulatory and financial reforms in the forest sector and
capacity building in the State Forestry Department and other agencies dealing with the forest sector; sustainable
forest planning and management in demonstration areas which would serve for replication, and support more
effective forest protection and reforestation in selected priority areas. 1. National Regulatory and Financial Reforms
and Institutional Strengthening (total cost US$4.41 million): The project would complete the institutional and
regulatory reforms initiated with PPF financing, and would support: (a) Finalization of the forest regulatory
framework, including: finalization of subsidiary regulations for implementation of the Forest Code, harmonization
with environmental, budgetary and tax legislation, redefinition of institutional functions of agencies related to the
forest sector, development of regulations for the transfer and management of community (local) forests, public
discussion of these draft regulations(b) Revision of financial and tax regulations in the forest sector, including: (i)
revision of the method of financing the State Forestry Department to guarantee for it a sustainable source of
revenue to carry out forest management and protection functions; (ii) revision of forest resource pricing principles
and methodologies, including stumpage regulations in order to differentiate by quality and provide stronger
incentives for resource conservation; and (iii) implementation of administrative regulations in order to allow for
better tracking of timber harvesting and exports and improved coordination with the customs administration.
Agreement on the mechanisms for implementing these financial reforms would be a dated covenant in the credit
agreement (e.g. 12 months after credit effectiveness). (c) Public education and awareness campaign to help
finalize the new national forest policy and strategy; secure stakeholder support for a medium term vision for
Georgia's forests, equipment, TV, newspaper and other mass media campaigns, consultants' services and training
for development of the program, workshops, dissemination, and a hotline for the local population to send proposals
for better forest management.(d) Development of improved national standards for certification of forest
management and utilization practices (including environmentally safe forest harvesting and forest road
improvementmaintenance standards).(e) Capacity-building in the State Forest Department through (i) support for
training and re-training programs for State Forest Department central and district staff; (ii) university-level training
and research program for the forest sector (iii) implementation of the nationwide forest district rationalization plan
(developed under PPF), including preparation of operational business plans for new districts; and (iv) basic
rehabilitation of and logistical support to forest offices in Tbilisi, five districts in the Central Caucasus and nine
districts with heavily eroded forest areas; (v) phased installation of the national Forest Management Information
System (FMIS) on the basis of smaller scale pilot information systems developed and tested in the Central
Caucasus pilot area.2. Improved Forest Planning and Management in Central Caucasus Pilot Area (total cost
US$9.05 million)(a) Introduction of improved techniques for forest inventory on an ecological basis: (i)
Development of ecosystems-based landscape planning and forest inventory approaches using sustainable forest
management principles (ointly with the GEF-financed Protected Areas Development Project); (ii) support to a
landscape planning, ecosystem-based inventory involving multiple stakeholders; (iii) further development of the
Total Economic Valuation of forests and its application and testing in specific model areas of landscape inventory;
(iv) detailed forest inventory and management plans in the areas selected for sustainable forest utilization; and (v)
4



testing of components of a Forest Management Information System (FMIS) prior to their expansion at the national
level. (b) Improvement of forest roads for better forest management: (i) Road maintenance and rehabilitation in the
areas selected for detailed forest management planning and sustainable forest utilization. An estimated 150 km of
roads would be rehabilitated. (ii) A limited length of new road would also be constructed (estimated at up to 70 km)
if environmental impact assessments and management plans approved according to Georgian environmental law
indicate that these will improve the sustainability of forest management. Their location would be determined
following the detailed forest management plans and site-specific studies. (c) Training in improved forest harvesting
technologies: (i) Support to improved forest silvicultural operations (appropriate stand thinning and tending, site
preparation and improvement) through provision of one improved cable logging system and related equipment to
be used in areas with approved forest management plans; (ii) provision of training in this improved technology to
small harvesting enterprises in the Central Caucasus. (d) Support to communal forest management: the project
would learn from the early experience of the KfW-financed pilot communal forest management project expected to
be piloted in 2002-2004 over 15,000 ha of forest in ten communes (sakrebulo) in the support zone of the Borjomi-
Kharagauli National Park.. The IDA project would replicate this experience, starting from the 3rd year, over 50,000
ha of community forests in self-selected communes of the Central Caucasus. Assistance would be provided to
these communes in preparation and implementation of participatory communal forest/range management plans
and development of necessary extension services and training in local forest and range management.3. Forest
Protection and Reforestation in Selected Priority Areas (total cost US$11.52 million)(a) Support to improved forest
inspection and oversight through (i) a 5 person mobile inspectorate unit to verify forest operations at district level
and (ii) strengthening enforcement in the Central Caucasus and other selected priority areas through logistical and
equipment support to forest guards.(b) Improved forest protection: support to improved forest pest protection and
effective fire management, including pest and fire hazard analysis and diagnosis, laboratory renovation, fire and
pest monitoring and support to integrated pest management, including testing and certification of improved pest
control methods (according to criteria approved by Georgian law and the Bank operational policy on use of
pesticides). (c) Seed collection, processing and storage (seed processing equipment, de-winging, de-coning,
propagators for seed germination, lab equipment, complete a building renovation, development of seed
certification standards). (d)  Renovation of the central nursery buildings and irrigation system, seedling
development in the nurseries, and transport of seedlings (e) Reforestation, afforestation and provision of
shelterbelts over an approximately 8,100 ha of sloping and degraded land in nine districts around Tbilisi. 4. Project
Management and Monitoring (total cost US$1.07 million)(a) Support to project implementation management and
monitoring, including procurement and financial management support, and training to State Forest Department
staff in Bank project management approaches.

6. Implementation
The project's implementation arrangements have been approved by the Presidential Decree dated October 29,
2000 and include the following main elements. The project's main implementing agency is the State Forestry
Department, with its staff at central and district levels being responsible for technical and policy issues of project
implementation. The Ministry of Finance is responsible for the project's financial management and oversight. The
project is supervised by an inter-agency Supervisory Board (appointed by a presidential decree) which is chaired
by a member of the Parliament and comprised of officials of the key interested ministries/departments (such as
Economy, Finance, Environment, Agriculture, Forestry, Land Management, Protected Areas) and presidential
administration, with participation of the academic and NGO community. The Supervisory Board would meet at least
every 3 months, approve annual reports, work plans and budgets and resolve inter-agency issues. In order to
assure coordination with the Protected Areas Projects, its membership is substantially the same as that of the
Protected Areas Project. The project management unit is the Forest Sector Development Center of Georgia
(FSDC) - founded by the President of Georgia in October 2000 as a 'legal body of civil law' with an overall
responsibility for implementation of project components, including procurement, administration, reporting and
monitoring. FSDC reports to the State Forestry Department (SFD) on technical matters and to the Ministry of
Finance on financial matters (with both agencies sitting on the project's Supervisory Board). FSDC has a core staff
of seven, including the Project Director, technical manager, financial manager, accountant, procurement specialist,
operational assistant, and secretary-interpreter. Additional consultants (national coordinators) support the SFD
central and district managers and the FSDC core staff in organization and planning of project activities under
specific subcomponents in specific geographical areas. FSDC is already administering the on-going preparatory
activities funded by the Japanese Grant and the PPF and its operations are currently funded from the PPF.
Financial and procurement monitoring would be assured by the Project Monitoring and Reporting System (see
5



below). The project would also monitor outputs and project progress through simple project reports produced every
6 months. Annual progress reports would also be prepared which would guide preparation of the next years
annual work plan and would be agreed upon annually with the World Bank. These would highlight both
implementation problems and emerging design problems, and permit adjustment of project elements as required.
Funds would be provided for independent review of particular activities if required. The project foresees support for
community forest management, but only from the third year of the project, after the lessons of experience from the
KFW pilot project is During year 3 the PIU would complete the preparation work required for implementation of this
activity under the project, and it would be approved by the Bank as part of the annual work plan. The format of both
the 6-monthly and the annual reports would be agreed to during negotiations. At the end of year 3 there would be a
mid-term review, which would also permit review of progress and adjustment in project design. Its scope would be
agreed to in discussion with the Bank. Project financial management Financial management assessment: The
financial management arrangements of the FSDC do not currently satisfy the minimum requirements of the Bank.
The FSDC has agreed to develop its financial management arrangements on the basis of those already
developed by the Protected Areas Development Project (PADP) which were found by the Bank to be satisfactory.
These are described in more detail in Annex 6. Project Management Reports (PMRs) and Disbursements. Project
management-oriented PMRs will be used for project monitoring and supervision and the indicative formats of these
will be agreed upon during appraisal. The FSDC will start producing a full set of PMRs for every calendar quarter
throughout the life of the project beginning with the period ending December 31, 2002. Credit funds will initially be
disbursed on the basis of established procedures, including Statements of Expenditures (SOEs), and a move to
PMR-based disbursements will be considered once the FSDC is familiar with the project's monitoring aspects and
is considered able to produce sufficiently timely and reliable PMRs. Audit Arrangements. Annual audits will be
conducted by independent private auditors acceptable to the Association, and procured by the FSDC through the
Least-Cost Selection process. Audited project financial statements will be provided to the Association within six
months of the end of each fiscal year and also at the closing of the project. The cost of the audit will be financed
from the proceeds of the credit. The FSOC will develop a terms of reference and short-list of auditors for the
annual audit prior to Board presentation.
7. Sustainability
The project does not involve significantly increased recurrent cost financing and does not involve new staff
recruitment. Incremental recurrent costs are estimated at US$1.7 million over the project period (or on average
about US$0.3 million per annum). These compare with present annual budget allocation to SFD of US$1 million.
As indicated above the project should generate substantially increased revenues for the Treasury by improving tax
collection from forest management activities.
The project would be implemented by existing institutions with management support from the PIU; capacity
building of the State Forestry Department during implementation would ensure that project activities will continue
after Bank support ends. (Georgian forest staff have a good basic trainingand education, though it has been
difficult to maintain this since the transition). District organizations exist and would also be strengthened with the
assistance of project activities. Social sustainability should be assured by the involvement of a range of
stakeholders and local communities in project implementation.
8. Lessons learned from past operations in the country/sector
Experience with project implementation in Georgia has indicated that strong ownership of key stakeholders, at
political as well as at technical and community level, is key to project success. Adequate donor coordination is
also important. Project preparation has included an extended period of consensus building at political, technical
and local level for the improved approaches to forest management incorporated into project design. There have
and will continue to be extensive consultations with the donor and NGO community, with which relations are good
in the forest sector. Implementation issues have included difficulties with counterpart funding and lack of clarity
regarding procedures for payment of VAT, social charges and taxes, and difficulties with financial management.
These issues are now being addressed at a country level with additional support and oversight being provided
from the Tbilisi office, and the project management unit, in developing its operational manual, has taken account of
the lessons learned. Project implementation in the region more generally has also illustrated the importance of
involving all stakeholders in the planning of policy and institutional changes; when this is well done, the overall
environment, at community, political and technical level, is generally very positive towards improved forest
management. Forestry in ECA has also benefited from an OED review of ECA forest operations completed in 2000
in the context of a review of the 1991 Forest Strategy, and project design takes these lessons into account. (The
review also emphasizes the importance of stakeholder participation, but also recommends expanded support for
"stand-alone" forest projects as they can best tackle forest policy and management issues, and greater integration
of forestry issues into the country assistance dialogue).
9. Program of Targeted Intervention (PTI) N
10. Environment Aspects (including any public consultation)
6



Issues : The project's environmental assessment (EA) and management plan (EMP) have been commissioned in
the form of a Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SEA), as the project is designed to have a sectoral impact. The
main findings and recommendations of the SEA were taken into consideration during project design and are
reflected in the project components. The results of the SEA and EMP are summarized below and in Annex 12. The
full Sectoral EA is available in a separate document in the project files.The SEA concludes that the proposed
project will improve overall environmental management of Georgia's forests. Georgia has comprehensive
environmental legislation, covering the forest sector, but there are still certain legal inconsistencies and also the
capacity for its implementation is not adequate. In this regard, introduction of the right incentives for long term
investment and sustainable use of forest resources and reducing illegal felling and smuggling of timber are the key
challenges to be taken by the Govemment with support from the project.Assistance to the improved forest
management planning is a  critical component of the project. The practice of developing ten-year forest
management plans has been in place in Georgia for decades, though none of the plans - prepared mostly 10-15
years ago - have been updated in the last ten years and neither have they been implemented due to insufficient
funding. Current level of public participation on land use and forest management planning is not satisfactory. The
project will provide for the development of technically sound and participatory methods of planning based on
technically up-to-date and reliable information base, deploying Forest Management Information Systems and GIS
technology. This activity would be supported jointly with the GEF-funded Protected Areas Development Project.
Infrastructure and wood harvesting systems currently used for harvesting forest resources are out-of-date and
depreciated. Forest roads and the main district roads are in a poor condition. Environmental damage caused by
logging is much higher than it could have been for the same volume of extracted timber if better technologies were
deployed. The project will provide for demonstration of the advanced and environmentally less damaging
equipment for harvesting, including skyline  cable lines designed for mountain terrain. Rehabilitation and
construction of some forest roads will be carefully planned and implemented in a selected zone of the Central
Caucasus for maximizing economic benefits and reducing environmental damage caused by long skidding
distances, which create erosion channels. Environmentally sound construction practices and technologies will be
tested out and promulgated for their adoption county-wide. Other environmental benefits of the project include
reduced erosion and improved hydrological regimes of reforested areas and an increase in atmospheric carbon
sequestration resulting from afforestation activities of degraded slopes. No serious negative impacts of the project
were identified. Minor potential impacts might include damage from misuse of harvesting and roading equipment at
demonstration and training sites. This risk would be addressed by proper design and selection of sites for
demonstration activities which will be subject to a site-specific environmental review and permit. A similar minor
risk is associated with erosion caused by misuse of heavy equipment during limited forest road rehabilitation and
construction. This risk would be also addressed by limiting road activities only to appropriate areas delineated by
the overall landscape-based forest management plan, and road contractors would have to comply with improved
road standards. Selection of road sites will also be subject to site-specific environmental review and permit.

OP/BP 4.12, Involuntary Resettlement (forthcoming); OP/GP 4.36, Forestry; OP/BP 10.04, Economic Evaluation
of Investment Operations; and OD 4.20, Indigenous Peoples. This OP and BP apply to all projects for which a
PID is first issued after March 1, 1999. Questions may be addressed to the Chair, Environment Sector Board.   I
1. The Bankl requires environmental assessment (EA) of projects proposed for Bank financing to help ensure that they
are environmentally sound and sustainable, and thus to improve decision making.
2. EA is a process whose breadth, depth, and type of analysis depend on the nature, scale, and potential environmental
impact of the proposed project. EA evaluates a project's potential environmental risks and impacts in its area of
influence;2 examines project alternatives; identifies ways of improving project selection, siting, planning, design, and
implementation by preventing, minimizing, mitigating, or compensating for adverse environmental impacts and
enhancing positive inpacts; and includes the process of mitigating and managing adverse enviromnental impacts
throughout project implementation. The Bank favors preventive measures over mitigatory or compensatory measures,
whenever feasible.
3. EA takes into account the natural environment (air, water, and land); human health and safety; social aspects
(involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, and cultural property);3 and transboundary and global environmental
aspects.4 EA considers natural and social aspects in an integrated way. It also takes into account the variations in project
and country conditions; the findings of country environmental studies; national environmental action plans; the country's
overall policy framework, national legislation, and institutional capabilities related to the environment and social
aspects; and obligations of the country, pertaining to project activities, under relevant international environmental
treaties and agreements. The Bank does not finance project activities that would contravene such country obligations, as
identified during the EA.
EA is initiated as early as possible in project processing and is integrated closely with the economic, financial,
institutional, social, and technical analyses of a proposed project.
4. The borrower is responsible for carrying out the EA. For Category A projects,5 the borrower retains independent EA
experts not affiliated with the project to carry out the EA.6 For Category A projects that are highly risky or contentious
or that involve serious and multidimensional environmental concerns, the borrower should normally also engage an
advisory panel of independent, internationally recognized environmental specialists to advise on all aspects of the
project relevant to the EA.7 The role of the advisory panel depends on the degree to which project preparation has
progressed, and on the extent and quality of any EA work completed, at the time the Bank begins to consider the project.
5. The Bank advises the borrower on the Bank's EA requirements. The Bank reviews the findings and recommendations
of the EA to determine whether they provide an adequate basis for processing the project for Bank financing. When the
borrower has completed or partially completed EA work prior to the Bank's involvement in a project, the Bank reviews
the EA to ensure its consistency with this policy. The Bank may, if appropriate, require additional EA work, including
public consultation and disclosure.
2



6. The Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook describes pollution prevention and abatement measures and
emission levels that are normally acceptable to the Bank. However, taking into account borrower country legislation and
local conditions, the EA may recommend alternative emission levels and approaches to pollution prevention and
abatement for the project. The EA report must provide full and detailed justification for the levels and approaches
chosen for the particular project or site.
EA Instruments
7. Depending on the project. a range of instruments can be used to satisfy the Bank's EA requirement: environmental
impact assessment (EIA), regional or sectoral EA, environmental audit, hazard or risk assessment, and environmental
management plan (EMP).8 EA applies one or more of these instruments, or elements of them, as appropriate. When the
project is likely to have sectoral or regional impacts, sectoral or regional EA is required.9
Environmental Screening
8. The Bank undertakes environmental screening of each proposed project to determine the appropriate extent and type
of EA. The Bank classifies the proposed project into one of four categories, depending on the type, location, sensitivity,
and scale of the project and the nature and magnitude of its potential environmental impacts.
(a) Category A: A proposed project is classified as Category A if it is likely to have significant adverse environmental
impacts that are sensitive,10 diverse, or unprecedented. These impacts may affect an area broader than the sites or
facilities subject to physical works. EA for a Category A project examines the project's potential negative and positive
environmental impacts, compares them with those of feasible alternatives (including the "without project" situation), and
recommends any measures needed to prevent, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for adverse impacts and improve
environmental performance. For a Category A project, the borrower is responsible for preparing a report, normally an
EIA (or a suitably comprehensive regional or sectoral EA) that includes, as necessary, elements of the other instruments
referred to in para. 7.
(b) Category B: A proposed project is classified as Category B if its potential adverse environmental impacts on human
populations or environmentally important areas-including wetlands, forests, grasslands, and other natural habitats-are
less adverse than those of Category A projects. These impacts are site-specific; few if any of them are irreversible; and
in most cases mitigatory measures can be designed more readily than for Category A projects. The scope of EA for a
Category B project may vary from project to project, but it is narrower than that of Category A EA. Like Category A
EA, it examines the project's potential negative and positive environmental impacts and recommends any measures
needed to prevent, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for adverse impacts and improve environmental performance. The
findings and results of Category B EA are described in the project documentation (Project Appraisal Document and
Project Information Document).ll
(c) Category C: A proposed project is classified as Category C if it is likely to have minimal or no adverse
environmental impacts.
Beyond screening, no further EA action is required for a Category C project.
(d) Categorv F1: A proposed project is classified as Category Fl if it involves investment of Bank funds through a
financial intermediary, in subprojects that may result in adverse environmental impacts.
EA for Special Project Types
Sector Investment Lending
9. For sector investment loans (SILs),12 during the preparation of each proposed subproject, the project coordinating
entity or implementing institution carries out appropriate EA according to country requirements and the requirements of
this policy. 13 The Bank appraises and, if necessary, includes in the SIL components to strengthen, the capabilities of the
coordinating entity or the implementing institution to (a) screen subprojects, (b) obtain the necessary expertise to carry
out EA, (c) review all findings and results of EA for individual subprojects, (d) ensure implementation of mitigation
measures (including, where applicable, an EMP), and (e) monitor environmental conditions during project
implementation.14 If the Bank is not satisfied that adequate capacity exists for carrying out EA, all Category A
subprojects and, as appropriate, Category B subprojects-including any EA reports-are subject to prior review and
approval by the Bank.
Sector Adjustment Lending
10. Sector adjustment loans (SECALs) are subject to the requirements of this policy. EA for a SECAL assesses the
potential environmental impacts of planned policy, institutional, and regulatory actions under the loan.1 5
3



Financial Intermediary Lending
11. For a financial intermediary (FI) operation, the Bank requires that each FI screen proposed subprojects and ensure
that subborrowers carry out appropriate EA for each subproject. Before approving a subproject. the FI verifies (through
its own staff, outside experts, or existing environmental institutions) that the subproject meets the environmental
requirements of appropriate national and local authorities and is consistent with this OP and other applicable
environmental policies of the Bank.16
12 In appraising a proposed Fl operation, the Bank reviews the adequacy of country environmental requirements
relevant to the project and the proposed EA arrangements for subprojects, including the mechanisms and responsibilities
for environmental screening and review of EA results. When necessary, the Bank ensures that the project includes
components to strengthen such EA arrangements. For FI operations expected to have Category A subprojects, prior to
the Bank's appraisal each identified participating Fl provides to the Bank a written assessment of the institutional
mechanisms (including, as necessary, identification of measures to strengthen capacity) for its subproject EA work.17 If
the Bank is not satisfied that adequate capacity exists for carrying out EA, all Category A subprojects and, as
appropriate, Category B subprojects-including EA reports-are subject to prior review and approval by the Bank. 18
Emergency Recovenr Projects
13. The policy set out in OP 4.01 normally applies to emergency recovery projects processed under OP 8.50, Emergency
Recovery Assistance. However, when compliance with any requirement of this policy would prevent the effective and
timely achievement of the objectives of an emergency recovery project, the Bank may exempt the project from such a
requirement. The justification for any such exemption is recorded in the loan documents. In all cases, however, the Bank
requires at a minimum that (a) the extent to which the emergency was precipitated or exacerbated by inappropriate
environmental practices be determined as part of the preparation of such projects, and (b) any necessary corrective
measures be built into either the emergency project or a future lending operation.
Institutional Capacity
14. When the borrower has inadequate legal or technical capacity to carry out key EA-related functions (such as review
of EA, environmental monitoring, inspections, or management of mitigatory measures) for a proposed project, the
project includes components to strengthen that capacity.
Public Consultation
15. For all Category A and B projects proposed for IBRD or IDA financing, during the EA process, the borrower
consults project-affected groups and local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) about the project's environmental
aspects and takes their views into account.19 The borrower initiates such consultations as early as possible. For Category
A projects, the borrower consults these groups at least twice: (a) shortly after environmental screening and before the
terms of reference for the EA are finalized; and (b) once a draft EA report is prepared. In addition, the borrower consults
with such groups throughout project implementation as necessary to address EA-related issues that affect them.20
Disclosure
16. For meaningful consultations between the borrower and project-affected groups and local NGOs on all Category A
and B projects proposed for IBRD or IDA financing, the borrower provides relevant material in a timely manner prior to
consultation and in a form and language that are understandable and accessible to the groups being consulted.
17. For a Category A project, the borrower provides for the initial consultation a summary of the proposed project's
objectives, description, and potential impacts; for consultation after the draft EA report is prepared, the borrower
provides a summary of the EA's conclusions. In addition, for a Category A project, the borrower makes the draft EA
report available at a public place accessible to project-affected groups and local NGOs. For SILs and Fl operations, the
borrower/Fl ensures that EA reports for Category A subprojects are made available in a public place accessible to
affected groups and local NGOs.
18. Any separate Category B report for a project proposed for IDA financing is made available to project-affected
groups and local NGOs. Public availability in the borrowing country and official receipt by the Bank of Category A
reports for projects proposed for IBRD or IDA financing, and of any Category B EA report for projects proposed for
IDA funding, are prerequisites to Bank appraisal of these projects.
19. Once the borrower officially transmits the Category A EA report to the Bank, the Bank distributes the summary (in
English) to the executive directors (EDs) and makes the report available through its InfoShop. Once the borrower
officially transmits any separate Category B EA report to the Bank, the Bank makes it available through its InfoShop.21
If the borrower objects to the Bank's releasing an EA report through the World Bank InfoShop, Bank staff (a) do' not
continue processing an IDA project, or (b) for an IBRD project, submit the issue of further processing to the EDs.
4



Implementation
20. During project implementation, the borrower reports on (a) compliance with measures agreed with the Bank on the
basis of the findings and results of the EA, including implementation of any EMP, as set out in the project documents;
(b) the status of mitigatorv measures; and (c) the findings of monitoring programs. The Bank bases supervision of the
project's environmental aspects on the findings and recommendations of the EA, including measures set out in the legal
agreements, any EMP, and other project documents.22
I "Bank" includes IDA; "EA" refers to the entire process set out in OP/BP 4.01; "loans" includes credits, "borrower" includes, for guarantee
operations, a private or public project sponsor receiving from another fhnancial institution a loan guaranteed by the Bank; and "project" covers all
operations Financed by Bank loans or guarantees except structural adjustment loans (for which the environmental provisions are set out in OP/BP
S.60, Adjuisntment Lending, forthcoming) and debt and debt service operations, and also includes projects under adaptable lending-adaptable program
loans (APLs i and leaming and innovation loans (LILs)-and projects and components funded under the Global Environment Facility. The project is
described in Schedule 2 to the Loan/Credit Agreement. This policy applies to all components of the project, regardless of the source of financing
2. For definitions, see Annex A. The area of influence for any project is determined with the advice of environmental specialists and set out in the
EA terms of reference.
3. See OP!BP 4.12, Involunton Rese/tlement (forthcoming); OD 4.20, Indigenous Peoples; and OP 4.1 1, Safeguarding Cultural Property in Bank-
Financed Projects (forthcoming).
4 Global environmental issues include climate change, ozone-depleting substances, pollution of intemational waters, and adverse impacts on
biodiversity.
5. For screening. see para. 8.
6. EA is closely integrated with the project's economic, financial, institutional, social, and technical analyses to ensure that (a) environmental
considerations are given adequate weight in project selection, siting, and design decisions; and (b) EA does not delay project processing. However,
the borrower ensures that when individuals or entities are engaged to carry out EA activities, any conflict of interest is avoided. For example, when
an independent EA is required, it is not carned out by the consultants hired to prepare the engineering design.
7. The panel (which is different from the dam safety panel required under OP/ BP 4.37, Safety of Dams) advises the borrower specifically on the
following aspects: (a) the terms of reference for the EA, (b) key issues and methods for preparing the EA, (c) recommendations and findings of the
EA, (d) implementation of the EA's recommendations, and (e) development of environmental management capacity.
S. These terms are defined in Annex A. Annexes B and C discuss the content of EA reports and EMPs.
9. Guidance on the use of sectoral and regional EA is available in EA Sourcebook Updates 4 and 15.
10. A potential impact is considered "sensitive" if it may be irreversible (e.g., lead to loss of a major natural habitat) or raise issues covered by OD
4.20, Indigenous Peoples; OP 4.04, Natural Habitats; OP 4.11, Safeguarding Cultural Property in Bank-Financed Projects (forthcoming); or OP 4.12,
Involuntary Resettlement (forthcoming).
I 1. When the screening process determines, or national legislation requires, that any of the environmental issues identified warrant special attention,
the findings and results of Category B EA may be set out in a separate report. Depending on the type of project and the nature and magnitude of the
impacts, this report may include, for example, a limited environmental impact assessment, an environmental mitigation or management plan, an
environmental audit, oe a hazard assessment. For Category B projects that are not in environmentally sensitive areas and that present well-defined
and well-understood issues of narrow scope, the Bank may accept altemative approaches for meeting EA requirements: for example,
environmentally sound design criteria, siting criteria, or pollution standards for small-scale industrial plants or rural works; environmentally sound
siting criteria, construction standards, or inspection procedures for housing projects; or environmentally sound operating procedures for road
rehabilitation projects.
12. SILs normally involve the preparation and implementation of annual investment plans or subprojects as time slice activities over the course of
the project.
13. In addition, if there are sectorwide issues that cannot be addressed through individual subproject EAs (and particularly if the SIL is likely to
include Category A subprojects), the borrower may be required to carry out sectoral EA before the Bank appraises the SIL.
14. Where, pursuant to regulatory requirements or contractual arrangements acceptable to the Bank, any of these review functions are camed out by
an entity other than the coordinating entity or implementing institution, the Bank appraises such altemative arrangements; however, the
borrower/coordinating entity/implementing institution remains ultimately responsible for ensuring that subprojects meet Bank requirements.
15. Actions that would require such assessment include, for example, privatization of environmentally sensitive enterprises, changes in land tenure in
areas with important natural habitats, and relative price shifts in commodities such as pesticides, timber, and petroleum.
16. The requirements for Fl operations are derived from the EA process and are consistent with the provisions of para. 6 of this OP. The EA process
takes into account the type of finance being considered, the nature and scale of anticipated subprojects, and the environmental requirements of the
jurisdiction in which subprojects will be located.
17. Any Fl included in the project after appraisal complies with the same requirement as a condition of its participation.
18 The criteria for prior review of Category B subprojects, which are based on such factors as type or size of the subproject ant the EA capacity of
the financial intermediary, are set out in the legal agreements for the project.
19. For the Bank's approach to NGOs, see GP 14.70, Involving Nongovemmental Organizations in Bank-Supported Activities.
20. For projects with major social components, consultations are also required by other Bank policies-for example, OD 4.20, Indigenous Peoples,
and OP/BP 4.12, Involuntary Resettlement (forthcoming).
21. For a further discussion of the Bank's disclosure procedures, see The World Bank Policy on Disclosure of Information (March 1994) and BP
17.50, Disclosure of Operational Information. Specific requirements for disclosure of resettlement plans and indigenous peoples development plans

Environmental Assessment Sourcebook
UPDATE
Environment Department
The World Bank Number 4
October 1993
Sectoral Environmental Assessment
Sectoral environmental assessment (SEA) is a much needed complement to project-specific EAs in development
plannlng. Where project EAs focus on the impacts of specific investments and often treat sector strategic
planning as a given, SEA offers an opportunity for sector-wide environmental analysis before investment
priorities have been determined. It also supports integration of environmental concems into long-term
development and investment planning. SEA is most commonly applied in the context of sector investment
programs involving multiple sub-projects. It can also be applied in con-junction with sector-oriented time-slice
and line-of-credit projects, and even with sector adjustment operations or in evaluation of sector policies.
This EA Sourcebook Update, which belongs to Chapter 1: The Environmental Review Process (Update Binder),
de-scribes SEA in terms of advantages, operational context, selection criteria, and components. It also discusses
what some of the challenges associated with SEA preparation are, and how SEA is being used in Bank
operations. This Update expands on existing information in Chapter 1 (pp. 14-17) of the EA Sourcebook.
Background
World Bank guidance on sectoral EA was introduced in 1989 with the adoption of Operational Directive (OD)
4.00, Annex A: Environmental Assessment (amended in 1991 as OD 4.01). The Environmental Assessment
Sourcebook (1991) provided more detailed advice that has helped the Bank and its borrowers to introduce SEA
in project preparation, despite the lack of a tested methodology. On the basis of this accumulated experience, it
is now possible to expand Bank guidance on SEA.
SEA avoids the inherent limitations of project-specific EAs in addressing issues related to policy and planning
and the legal and institutional framework. By moving upstream in the planning process to a stage where major
strategic decisions have not yet been made, SEA offers better opportunities not only for analyzing existing
policies, institutions, and development plans in terms of environmental issues, but also for supporting
environmentally sound sector-wide investment strategies. A SEA may, for example, allow for a more realistic
environmental assessment of competing investment alternatives in the power sector, where one option might
favor massive coal thermal and hydro-electric expansion; a second option, nuclear and hydro-electric power; and
a third, a combination of coal and gas thermal power coupled with demand-side management and development
of renewable biomass energy. Similarly, where project-specific EA would analyze the impacts on ambient air
quality around a new industrial estate, the sectoral EA might look at the cumulative effects of acid rain or other
problems resulting from proposed industrial developments in terms of their regional, national or even trans-
national impacts.
The Bank's increasing use of programmatic, sector-oriented loans and time-slice investment programs has
served to build demand for a sectoral EA approach, and has provided the best opportunities for developing SEA
as a planning tool. An example of this approach is presented in Box 1. In other cases, sectoral EA may be the
only EA output if the sub-projects do not require EAs individually. Environmental planning measures and/or
guidelines developed by the SEA may then be applied (see Box 2 for a list of Bank-financed projects with a SEA
component).
Advantages of Sectoral EAs
The growing Bank experience with SEAs has revealed several important benefits to be gained from use of this
instrument in development planning (see Boxes 1 and 3-6). The following advantages are worth highlighting:
*  Sectoral EAs can prevent serious environmental impacts through analysis of sector policies and
investment strategies upstream in the planning process, before major decisions are made.
*  They can assist governments in forming a long-term view of the sector and can increase the
transparency of the sectoral planning process (that is, show the reasoning behind development plans),
thereby decreasing the opportunities for purely political decisions that might be environmentally harmful.
*  They are suitable for analysis of institutional, legal and regulatory aspects related to the sector, and for
making comprehensive and realistic recommendations regarding, for example, environmental
standards, guidelines, law enforcement, and training, thus reducing the need for similar analysis in
downstream EA work.
6



*  They provide opportunities for consideration of alternative policies, plans, strategies or project types,
taking into account their costs and benefits, particularly the environmental and social costs that are
often ignored in least-cost project planning.
*  SEAs help to alter or eliminate environmentally unsound investment alternatives at an early stage. thus
reducing overall negative environmental impacts, while also eliminating the.need for project-specific EA
of these alternatives (see Figure 1).
*  They are well suited to consider cumulative impacts of multiple ongoing and planned investments within
a sector, as well as impacts from existing policies and policy changes.
*  They are valuable for collecting and organizing environmental data into information and, in the process,
identifying data gaps and needs at an early stage, and for outlining methods, schedules and
responsibilities for data collection and management during program or project implementation.
*  They allow for comprehensive planning of general sector-wide mitigation, management, and monitoring
measures, and for identifying broad institutional, resource and technological needs at an early stage.
  They provide a basis for collaboration and coordination across sectors, and help to avoid duplication of
efforts and policy contradictions between sector agencies and ministries.
*  They may strengthen preparation and implementation of sub-projects by recommending criteria for
environmental analysis and review, and standards and guidelines for project implementation.
The Operational Context
Three broad operational contexts, or situations, may trigger SEA work. The need to interpret OD 4.01 varies
according to these contexts.
The first type of situation is a category A or B in-vestment program or a series of independent A and/or B projects
in a given sector. In these cases, the process and timing and the scope of the SEA should follow the
requirements of OD 4.01. For B projects a limited sectoral environmental analysis would normally be the
appropriate form of SEA. Types of projects in this first context may include:
v a national or sub-national sector program;
3 a series of projects in the same sector;
* a large project with sectoral implications;
X a sectoral intermediate credit operation; or
* a sectoral time-slice investment operation.
The second context is in projects and programs where a SEA is prepared to complement the planning process.
These SEAs may be triggered by Bank environmental screening of a project; but they cover a broader set of
issues than merely the impact of the project, and they proceed in parallel with the required project EA work. This
SEA approach may, for example, be appropriate in sectors with widespread and well-known environmental
damage although the project supported by the Bank may not create any significant additional problems. The
Bank might help secure funding for such SEA work, but OD 4.01 does not directly apply (and subsequently the
SEA does not have to be completed prior to appraisal). Box 6 provides an example of a SEA prepared in this
context.
The third context is when sectoral environmental analysis is employed without any direct link to lending activities.
In this case, the SEA is typically related to Bank economic and sector analysis for a country. OD 4.01 does not
apply, and no particular procedures need to be followed although this Update may provide valuable information.
Criteria for Choosing SEA
The following questions will help identify where a sectoral EA approach may be particularly appropriate and
useful in a project or program where OD 4.01 applies. If the answer to the following question is positive, SEA
should be seriously considered:
* Is the Bank considering any of the investment types listed in the section on Operational Context
(above), in a sector with significant environmental issues?
If the answer to the next three questions is also positive, SEA is highly recommended:
*  Are there major existing environmental problems associated with the sector, and/or sector-wide
potential environmental impacts resulting from the proposed program or series of projects?
*   Is there a clear potential for significant environmental improvement or avoidance of major problems in
the sector?
7



*  Are there clear policy, regulatory and/or institutional weaknesses relative to environmental management
in the sector?
*   In addition, there are conditions that increase the potential value of SEAs but are not sufficient or
completely necessary requirements:
*   Is the borrower at an early planning stage or at a new major investment phase, where important
strategic decisions have not yet been made?
*  Are conditions in the sector relatively stable and predictable (rather than tending to rapid and
unpredictable change), so as to allow for a medium to long-term planning horizon and therefore better
chance of gaining long-term value from the SEA?
*   Is the borrower willing to pay for the SEA  and likely to give weight to the findings and
recommendations?
Sections of a Sectoral EA Report
SEAs will vary in scope and content according to the types and significance of issues and the operational
context. A general outline for a full (category A) SEA can be constructed, however, using the guidance pro-vided
in OD 4.01, Annex B, for a full project-specific EA (see also Box 5 for a sector-specific example).
Executive Summary. As in a project-specific EA, a SEA should contain an executive summary (in English), with
a concise discussion of significant findings and recommended actions.
Policy, Legal and Administrative Framework. This section is one of the most important parts of a sectoral EA.
It is helpful to analyze both (1) the nation-al environmental legal, regulatory and institutional framework, and (2)
sector-specific policies, regulations and institutions (see Box 3). If other, recent studies have already analyzed
these dimensions in an adequate way, the SEA should draw on this work rather than duplicate it.
*   The national framework. The relevant national environmental policies, laws and regulations should be
assessed for completeness and appropriateness in light of the particular conditions and problems of the
sector, and gaps and weaknesses noted. Non-environmental laws and policies that have significance
for the sector's utilization of resources, production processes, or pollution should also be identified.
Similarly, the national regulatory framework for EA preparation and review should be assessed. The
SEA should look closely at the institutional capacity of the main environmental ministry or agency, in
terms of effectiveness and capacity for providing guidelines, setting and enforcing standards, and
reviewing environmental assessments. The capacity and performance of agencies responsible for
specific environmental services such as nature protection and cultural heritage should also be reviewed
when relevant.
*   The sector framework. The SEA should analyze sector-specific policies, laws and regulations that have
environmental implications. It should also identify how environmental responsibilities are distributed
among (public or private) sector institutions and assess their capacity to administer these tasks. The
sectoral investment planning process, in terms of objectives, methodology and procedures for review
and approval of plans and projects, should be carefully reviewed. The relationship between timing of
project review, issuance of licenses and permits, and the sectoral planning process should be clearly
indicated. The SEA should assess whether environmental and social issues are adequately covered by
current procedures.
Project Description. The nature and objectives of the program, plan, series of projects or other context to which
the SEA is attached should be described, and the main environmental issues associated with the sector and
these programs, identified.
Baseline Data. This section should describe and evaluate the current environmental situation in the sector.
Where a project-specific EA would describe conditions such as ambient air and water quality or existing impacts
from pollution around a proposed project site, the SEA should concentrate on the issues and problems that are
typical of the sector as a whole. For example, occupational health may be a concem across enterprises within a
specific industry; seepage of heavy metals into streams and groundwater may be a recurring problem in the
mining sector; or deforestation may result from activities in the agriculture sector. Another important function of
this section is to note major data gaps.
Environmental Impacts. The single most difficult challenge in SEAs is to produce a sufficiently precise impact
analysis, often in the face of uncertainties related to the final investment decisions and their individual and
combined impacts. In recent years, advances have been made in the methodologies for assessing cumulative
impacts, in relation to development plans and programs. Means include quantitative modeling, forecasting and
various qualitative analyses. If any proposed sub-project is expected to cause particularly significant impacts, the
SEA should recommend an appropriate course of action to address them, including carrying out a project-
specific EAs (see Box 4).
8



All cumulative effects should be considered: positive and negative, direct and indirect, long-term and short-term.
Aggregate problems such as sewage discharge, acid rain, ozone depletion and deforestation are usually the
result of several activities, sometimes stemming predominantly from a single sector. Cumulative impacts on
environmentally important and sensitive areas and assets such as coastal zones and wetlands, or freshwater
resources, are also important in cases where the sector activities heavily affect these areas and/or resources.
The sectoral EA is an appropriate instrument for considering issues related to long-term sustainable
development. Specifically, the SEA may contain a discussion of how a proposed investment program may
influence long-term productivity of environmental resources affected by the program.
Analysis of Alternatives. A major purpose of a SEA is to do a thorough analysis of alternative investment
options and strategies in terms of environmental costs and benefits. For example, if a proposed agricultural
program emphasizes conversion of wetlands to rice production, an alternative approach such as intensification of
production in existing fields, conversion of other land types, or crop rotation may be considered.
All major investments under consideration, be-sides the option being considered by the Bank, should be
considered at this stage, whether complementary or alternative to the Bank option. The other options may
include investments by the private as well as the public sector.
A comparative analysis of alternative programs is highly recommended, applying indicators of environ-mental
and social impacts and methods to evaluate and compare the indicators and ultimately the alter-native options.
Where several donors are involved in the sector, the SEA should review their existing and/or planned activities
and, if necessary, suggest ways to coordinate efforts.
The sectoral EA can also be used to evaluate the environmental effects of sector policy altematives. For
example, changes in tax and subsidy rates on the use of natural resources may greatly influence rates and
methods of extraction.
The analysis could conclude with a list of sector proposals, ranked according to environmental preference. The
analysis of impacts and altematives should result in a recommendation for an optimal investment strategy, in
terms of environmental and social costs and benefits.
Mitigation Plan. Mitigation measures are usually of a detailed, technical nature, and therefore normally
addressed in project-specific EAs. However, if planned or existing production and process technologies in a
sector are relatively uniform, the SEA could recommend broad options for eliminating, reducing to acceptable
levels, or mitigating environmental impacts. Such solutions could include a complete production system design
as well as end-of-pipe cleaning technologies. SEA mitigation recommendations should draw on findings from the
analysis of policy, legal and institutional issues as well as the analysis of impacts and altematives.
A SEA is an effective tool for designing and recommending mitigation measures that can be implemented only at
the national or sectoral level for regulatory or economic reasons. In an urban transportation program, for
example, automobile emission limits could be recommended if the level of emissions were found to supersede
acceptable standards for air quality. Similarly, in a sector program involving multiple investments, the SEA may
be better placed than project-specific EAs to consider sector-wide mitigation solutions that require economies of
scale in order to be cost-effective. Construction of a solid waste recycling plant for an entire country is one such
example.
Environmental Management and Training. One of the main outputs of a SEA should be an institutional plan for
improving environmental management in the sector, based on findings of the previous sections ( see Boxes 1
and 6). The plan might recommend training of exisfing staff, hiring of additional staff, reorganization of units or
agencies, or redefinition of roles and responsibilities. This section might also include recommendations on policy
and regulatory instruments for environmental management and enforcement in the sector. A screening process
to separate those sub-project needing a project-specific EA from those not requiring further analysis should be
designed, if it is not already in place (see Box 4).
Environmental Monitoring Plan. The SEA should provide general guidelines for long-term sector-wide
environmental monitoring to ensure adequate implementation of investments. A monitoring plan should use the
findings of the baseline data section as a basis to measure progress in mid-term review and final evaluation. The
plan should also recommend measures needed to collect and organize missing data.
Public Consultation. Public consultation is an integral part of the EA process, whether a project-specific or
sectoral EA is being prepared (see OD 4.01 and EA Sourcebook Update No. 5: Public Involvement in
Environmental Assessment for more specific guidance). However, since a SEA normally covers an entire sector
(in a national or subnational context) and is con-ducted before concrete investment decisions are made, it may
not always be possible to consult representatives of all potentially affected people during preparation of the SEA.
Often, it is more feasible and appropriate to carry out consultations with national NGOs (for example, for nature
protection), scientific experts, relevant govemment agencies, and perhaps also industrial and commercial
interests. A successfully implemented consultation process will help ensure public support for the final sector
program.

Challenges in SEA
Timing and Status
In order for a SEA to reach its full potential as a planning tool, it must be undertaken in concert with the overall
investment planning in the sector. In practice, this is sometimes difficult to achieve because Bank-financed
projects and programs are often prepared after government sector planning and strategic decision- making. This
makes any consideration of strategic alternatives difficult Early coordination between the planning processes of
the borrower and the Bank is the best way to overcome this constraint.
If a SEA is undertaken, its relevance to sector planning should be ensured through preparation of terms of
reference (TORs) and coordination between preparers and sector planners. If SEAs over time demonstrate high
quality and usefulness as a planning tool, they likely will have growing acceptance.
Costs
A sectoral EA is generally more costly to undertake than project-specific EA. For this reason, some borrowers
may be reluctant to choose the SEA option unless the SEA can be expected to so improve the quality of sector
planning that the need will be reduced for project-specific EA work-and associated costs-downstream.
Appropriate TORs and Consultants
Experience and special skills are required to do adequate SEA work, especially in cumulative impact assessment
and in analysis of alternative options and the policy, legal and institutional framework. At the same time, TORs
for the EA need to be realistic in their requirements and manageable. TORs should narrow the scope of analysis
to issues that are most significant and widespread within the sector, rather than require coverage of all aspects.
TOR preparation and EA team selection should also support development of in-country capacity for SEA work.
Adjusting to Circumstances
A sectoral EA approach may be useful even in cases where major sector decisions have already been made. For
example, the SEA can be adjusted to the purposes of a time-slice or financial intermediary loan involving
numerous sub-projects in which the primary issue is setting up appropriate mechanisms for sub-project
screening, review, impact analysis, and monitoring. In these cases, doing a more limited SEA may reduce the
amount of EA work needed for individual sub-projects, while facilitating more effective review and monitoring at
the sectoral level.
In many developing countries, economic and social changes are often rapid and unpredictable, as are changes
in technological opportunities (for example, with regard to pollution abatement). On the other hand, planning time
frames tend to be long-term due to difficulties in raising capital and limited absorptive capacity. Because of this
tension, a full SEA may not always be the optimal option. An altemative approach, currently used by Kenya in the
energy sector and supported by the Bank, is to identify major investment options within the sector, rank them by
environ-mental and social criteria and impacts, and provide a general overview of mitigation requirements for
each option. This approach allows for gathering of essential data and can serve as a 'preamble" to project-
specific EAs where needed.
Ensuring Specificity and Follow-Up
Doing a SEA should not become an excuse for over-looking site-specific environmental issues, even though the
emphasis is primarily on issues generic to the sector. The SEA should be employed to identify prevalent
problems in the sector as a whole and major site-specific problems, which might subsequently be addressed in
project-specific environmental assessment. The SEA should help determine where more EA work is needed
downstream.
Boxes
Box 1. State of Orissa, India: Water Resources Consolidation Project
India has begun increasing irrigaton capacity through more efficient operation and maintenance of existing facilities, rather than
through construction and development. A series of Water Resources Consolidaton projects (WRCP) currently being planned by
four State Govemments and supported by the Bank will fadlitate this change of direction. A sectoral EA approach is being
adopted for these projects because: (1) they are substantially programmatic and not all activities will be fully defined at appraisal;
(2) the main environmental issues concem monitoring and management rather than impacts from new construction projects; and
(3) environ-mental considerations related mainly to water quality and quantity are becoming increasingly important in all these
states. The govemments need improved technical advice on how to cope with these challenges on the institutional and policy
level.
The first of these projects was Orissa WRCP, and preparation of the SEA was divided into two phases. Phase 1, currently in
progress, focuses heavily on the institubonal and legal framework for the water sector and includes the following objectives and
tasks:
10



*   to assist in establishing an Environmental Group within the Orssa Irrigation Department's Central Planning Unit;
*   to review the status of environmental legislation and its applicability to the water resource sector in general, and to
proposed projects in particular;
*   to provide guidelines for the approach to and the preparation of required Site Clearance and Environmental Clearance
documents for various types of irrigation projects (such as dams, irrigation development, river basin plans, major
drainage and flood protection works, and rehabilitation of major irngation schemes):
*   to provide initial training for the water resource sector and other related govemment staff in EA procedures, techniques
and analyses;
*   to establish the organization, staffing levels, responsibilities, operating procedures and budgeting for a proposed
environmental sector unit;
*   to prepare a comprehensive training and institution-al strengthening program, including 2-3 case study EAs for
representative projects; and
*   to delineate procedures for interagency liaison and internal department clearances for water resource project EAs with
departments such as Environment, Forests, and Health Service.
*   The total cost of the Phase I program was estimated at US $446,700, with staff requirements estimated at 34.5 person
months.
Phase 2 will be based on findings and recommendations of the first phase. It would probably include such components as
preparation and completion of the case studies, long-term training in EA, preparation of monitorng plans for the irrigation sector,
and upgrade of the environmental monitoring facilities.
Box 3. Bolivia: Sectoral EA for Industry and Mining
The purpose of this EA was to help design the Environment, Industry and Mining Project (EIMP), proposed to begin about mid-
1995. A sectoral approach was chosen to strengthen capability in planning new industrial and mining investments and to build
institutional capacity for environmental management. The SEA was prepared by a Swedish team and a counterpart group
appointed by the National Environmental Secretarat (SENMA). The EA report included all the components described in OD
4.01-Annex B, with an emphasis on (1) the policy, legal and institutional framework, generally and specifically, for the two
sectors; (2) assessment of impacts from on-going activities and planned investments (covering natural resources and the
environment, occupational health and safety, social structures, and heavily affected regions); and (3) recommendations for a
mitigation plan. There was also a separate chapter on public participation in the EA process, which documented consultations
with some 40 govemmental and nongovemmental organizations, including several NGOs at the local level.
Policy, Legal and Institutional Framework
The analysis of the cross-sectoral policy, legal and institutional framework was comprehensive and covered the following aspects:
(1) organizabon of the State (branches of govemment, key ministries and major legal instruments); (2) economic policy; (3)
national policies, laws and institutions for the environment; (4) environmental impact assessment requirements; (5) policies and
laws for the use of natural resources; (6) environmental management in areas such as water quality, solid waste, pesticides and
air pollution; (7) occupational health and safety; and (8) foreign assistance. Major issues related to the policy, legal and
institutional framework included: (1) unclear environmental law about institutional responsibilities, which leads to weak
enforcement; (2) almost no environmental laws regarding mining, and poor enforcement of the few provisions in place; (3) no
regulations specifically for hazardous waste or industrial air emissions; and (4) no effective regulation of industrial water pollubon
except in a few municipalities.
EA Recommendations
The EA preparers were able to produce a series of concrete recommendations that were directly related to the environmental
problems caused by activities in the two sectors. Recommendations for changes fell into three areas: (1) broad policy, legal and
institutional changes (e.g., setting goals for ambient environmental quality, implementing new EIA regulation, and improving
laboratory capacity); (2) major mitigation activities (e.g., ad-dressing environmental issues in privatization of state-owned mines
on the basis of environmental audits, ex-tending sewerage systems in Cochabamba, and addressing problems related to alluvial
gold mining in the Bolivian Amazon basin); and (3) additional priorities (e.g., encouraging broad public participation, building a
coherent national environmental database, and introducing environmental audits, first voluntarily and eventually as a requirement,
of industrial and mining facilities).
Box 4. Procedures for Sectoral EA: Asia Region
Extensive experience with program and time-slice lending in the highway sector, particularly rural areas, has spurred development
of informal procedures for sectoral EA in the Bank's Asia region, to ensure consideration of all possible impacts on the
environment. According to the informal procedures, a sectoral EA should contain:
* a screening process designed to identify sub-projects having potentially significant issues that would need to be addressed in a
sub-project EA;
* a general assessment of the kinds of impacts that might be associated with the different types of rural road sub-projects; and
11



* a sectoral environmental action plan to eliminate, minimize or mitigate the impacts identified in the sectoral EA, and provide
general guidelines for long-term monitoring.
Two categories are used in environmental screening of sub-projects:
* sub-projects that may create a few minor and easily recognizable environmental problems, but no significant ones; and
* sub-projects with potentially adverse impacts on environmentally sensitive areas, defined as zones of significant human
habitation; ecologically important areas such as wetlands and primary forests; archeological, histoncal and cultural sites; and
terrain with slope greater than 50%.
The second category of sub-projects requires project-specific EA, while the first category is ad-dressed prmarily through the
sectoral EA in the form of general impact assessments, sectoral action plans, and codes of engineerng practice for
environmentally sustainable road development. These codes apply to both categories of sub-projects and cover such issues as
construction practices, site selection, resettlement and compensabon, and public consultation/ participation.
Box 5. Technical SEA Guidelines in the
Electricity Sector: LAC Region
The Bank's Latin American and Carbbean (LAC) region has developed technical guidelines for sectoral EA in the electricity
sector, based on its extensive experience in this sector. The guidelines stipulate that a sectoral EA is recommended where
project-specific EAs are not appropriate, due to:
* minimal preparation of individual project components at the time of Bank appraisal (e.g., hydro-power developments may be at
very preliminary stages of planning);
the nature of the lending operation, such as time-slice operations involving a large number of projects at varying stages of
development; and/or,
* the nature and scale of the projects or programs under consideration.
The guidelines describe the principal sections of a SEA for the power sector: (1) descripton of the cur-rent situation of the power
sector; (2) review of the country's environmental institubonal framework; (3) review of the power sector's regulatory framework
and planning procedures; (4) analysis of planned and altemative power sector strategies; (5) choice of an optimal investment
strategy; (6) review of institution-al capacity of power sector agencies; (7) public consultafion; and (8) action plan (for mitigation,
management and monitoring).
Box 6. Morocco: Large-Scale Irrigation II
(Sectoral EA as Part of Sector Planning)
The Govemment of Morocco and the Bank agreed to conduct a sectoral EA as a complementary activity in the preparation of this
project. Although a full EA or SEA was not required for the proposed project under OD 4.01, both parties saw the potential added
value a SEA could bring to the integration of environmental concems into the long-term development of the irrigation sector.
Concurrently, the investment component of the project, focusing on the rehabilitabon of existing irrigation infrastructure, was
placed in environment screening category B and was thus the subject of a field-based environmental review. A joint venture of two
French consulting firms, financed with a Japanese grant, was hired (following a competitive selection process) to prepare both the
SEA and the environmental review.
The SEA examined the long-term environmental implications of proposed future investments in the sector; evaluated
environmental concems associated with system operation and maintenance; and analyzed institutional, legal and regulatory
aspects. The SEA proposed an environmental management frame-work focused on development of environmental units for
irrigation at both the national and district levels. Support for the initial phase of implementation of the institutional strengthening
and training recommend-ed in the SEA was included in the project. It should be noted that the SEA preparation and review
process resulted in signiricantly increased awareness of the diversity and complexity of environmental issues in this sector by the
Moroccan study coordinators and participants.
The SEA provided an analysis of legal, regulatory and institutional aspects of environmental management in the irrigation sector,
including recommendations for: (1) creation of new institutions responsible for policy and strategy formulation, environmental
monitoring, and training; and (2) development of new laws and regulabons for improving management and overall performance in
the sector. Major technical actvibes recommended in the SEA included: (1) protection of watersheds; (2) water use planning; (3)
soil conservation; (4) protecton of ecologically sensitive habitats and species; (5) public health programs and monitoring; and (6)
training and special studies.

ANNEX 9
PUBLIC CONSULTATION AND DISCLOSURE PLAN - GUIDELINES
1






Public Consultation and Disclosure Plan - Guidelines
Public Consultation as part of an Environmental Assessment
In accordance with World Bank policy, a Sectoral Assessment has been implemented. Public consultation is an
integral part of the Environmental Assessment process, when a project specific or sectoral EA is being
implemented. However, since SEA covers an entire forest sector in national context and is conducted before
concrete investment decisions are made, at this level, it was not possible to consult representatives of all
potentially concerned people during preparation of this SEA. Obviously, successful consultation process will help
ensure public support for the final forest sector program. Therefore, in the beginning of the study potential
stakeholders were identified and consultations were held.
The purpose of public consultation during an SEA is two-fold. First, consultation during the SEA preparation
process helps to identify key environmental issues and provides information on stakeholders' concerns about
and views of potential cumulative environmental impacts of development of various scenarios of the investment
program. Second, consultation allows stakeholders to review findings and comment on proposed mitigation and
management options.
Levels of Consultation
The consultation process for the SEA will take place at two levels:
At the national level, consultation with interested government bodies, NGOs, and other interested members of
civil society will take place at both the preparation phase and the disclosure of the SEA phase.
At the local level, consultation with govemment authorities, forest users, potentially affected nearby villagers, and
any other interested stakeholders will take place in some depth during the SEA preparation phase. Public
meetings at the regional level will be organized for the second phase of consultation, when the SEA report is
disclosed and discussed.
Phases of Consultation
For the purposes of the SEA, consultation will take place in the following way:
SEA preparation: During the SEA preparation, consultation will take place with key stakeholders at the local
level. These include:
* Local branches of the State Department of Forest Management
* Local branches of the Ministry of Environment
Local branches or agencies of relevant State Authorities (State Department of Geology, Roads,
Protected Areas, Land Management, etc.);
* Local government authorities
* Village Councils nearby forest who might be affected by the project implementation
* NGOs active in the relevant local areas
*  Forest farms
*  Wood processing enterprises
*  Forest users (private companies)
*  Any other stakeholders identified through the consultation process
List of stakeholders interviewed to date is given in Annex 1.
At the national level, consultation will also take place on a general project input level in Tbilisi. Consultation with
an interested audience will be undertaken as a method of disclosing information about the project and the SEA,
and receiving feedback on either the process or specific aspects of the project.
2



EIA of Proposed Projects in the Forest Sector
Once the concrete investment decisions are made and project is finalized, EIA of the proposed project must be
implemented according to the national legislation and the World Bank guidelines described in Operational Policy
4.01 "Environmental Assessment". EIA of the specific projects must focus on potential impacts of the proposed
project and develop mitigation measures to ensure that the project options are sound and sustainable. EIA is
expected to inform all stakeholders and decision makers on the nature of the environmental risks and consult
representatives of all potentially affected people during preparation of the study.
Disclosure and Discussion of Draft EIA Report: When the draft EIA report is complete, it should be sent directly
to a group of key stakeholders, which will be identified during the first phase of consultation (as it was done
during SEA). A non-technical summary should be written, translated into Georgian and made widely available
through govemment and non-govemment networks at the national and local level.  Meetings with key
stakeholders at the national and local level should be held to discuss the EIA report in order to get reaction and
feedback to the environmental management options proposed in the draft report. Additionally, a series of public
meetings (provisionally in Tbilisi and on site) could be held, and advertised to the public at large in order to
disclose the draft EIA and the proposed environmental management plan.
Methods
The following methods could be used for disclosing and discussing project information:
* leaflet with basic project information (Text of project flyer see below),
* small group meetings,
* briefings/workshops at the regional/national level, and
* non-technical summary/executive summary of the EA report.
Meetings at the local level can be organized with the assistance of local offices of the State Department of Forest
Management and govemment authorities. Meetings at the national and regional level can be organized through
invitation to specific workshops, and through open advertisement using print media and radio of public meetings.
The non-technical summary of the draft EIA report should be distributed to identify interested parties and should
be made available at appropriate locations, such as govemment offices, libraries, town halls, and other sites
identified during the consultation process. The public should be notified of the availability of the non-technical
summary through appropriate media, such as posters at the local level and through newspaper and radio
advertisements at the national level.
On-going Consultation
Given that consultation is a process, this Public Consultation and Disclosure plan should be updated as the
consultation process proceeds in order to identify specifically which stakeholders should receive what kind of
information, and what mechanisms should be used to keep interested parties and stakeholders informed of and
included in the process.

Public Presentation of the findings of a Sectoral Environmental Assessment
(SEA)
Organization of Public Presentations
Based on what was learned during the first phase of consultation, and in accordance with the World Bank guidelines
two public presentations were held - one in Tbilisi (on May 18, 2001) and one in Oni (on June 2 2001). Oni was
selected as a site for a second public Presentation, firstly, as it is very important to let the local population in the Lab
Zone know regarding the planned activities envisaged by the FDP and there are notably more stakeholders with an
interest in that particular project site and secondly, as it was planned by the FSDC to organize a seminar in Oni.
*  Publicity
Notices about these presentations were posted at different relevant locations and were made widely available
through governmental and non-governmental networks at the national and local level (government offices, NGOs,
etc.) and included information on where to obtain a copy of the SEA and executive summary1. Individual invitations
were sent by the PIU to the relevant stakeholders as well.
Following the public presentation in Tbilisi on May 18, 2001, the Georgia Forest Sector Development Center
announced publicly the second time that the following documents were publicly available:
-  a soft version of the executive summary of the SEA in Georgian via e-mail upon request2;
-  hard copies of the SEA report in English and in Georgian at the public disposal at the office of the FSDC.
Deadline for comments and remarks was set till June 1st 2001.
-  Purpose of the meetings
The purpose of the meetings was to present the Sectoral Environmental Assessment of the Forests Development
Project to the public. The focus of the presentations was to reveal and disclose details of the SEA and the Project
itself, which were of concern to the participants. Together with representatives of NGOs and various State
organizations, appropriate technical staff from the PIU and the SDFM attended the presentations, in order to present
the planned Forests Development Project and introduce results of the Sectoral Environmental Assessment study,
and to respond to questions raised.
-  Outcome of Public Presentations
The presentations themselves provided an opportunity for the interested public to ask questions and raise concerns
about the SEA. They were both well attended, in particular by people dealing with the forestry issues, NGOs and by
local foresters in Oni meeting. The meeting in Tbilisi was attended by 35 persons and by49 persons in Oni. Both
presentations were chaired by Mr. Vladimer Abashidze, Director of the FSDC. A list of attendees at each of the
hearings is presented in the Annex. The meetings lasted for 3-4 hours. Discussions were in Georgian language with
translation provided for foreigners were necessary.
The meetings started with outlines main characteristics of the proposed Georgia Forests Development Project, and
was followed with presentation of Sectoral Environmental Assessment. It was emphasized that the SEA, which is the
essential tool for elaboration of the project, is a relatively new practice in Georgia. Difference between EIA and SEA
was explained and main objectives of SEA study were described. It was mentioned that the SEA developed
mitigation measures for different activities planned in the framework of the proposed project and proposed guidelines
for environmental management plan for the FDP considering general criteria of sustainability, participatory
management and biodiversity.
Discussions were very dynamic on many topics.
* Summary of some of the key concerns
A summary of some of the key concems raised (and answers) at the two presentations in Tbilisi and Oni is given
below.
* The value of Public Participation for SEA
The meetings were useful to the team preparing the SEA and to participants although rather different views and
interests were expressed by various participants.
A number of small changes in the content of the SEA were made as a result of ideas expressed at two public
presentations.
1 Copy of Notices are annexed in the end
2 Furthermore, 100 hard copies of executive summaries were distnbuted to attendees of the Tbilisi meeting and any interested individuals.

Comments
On the Georgian Version of the ACTA Final Report
Vl. Abashidze
Director of the Forest Sector Development Center (04.06.01)
1. p. 62 The concept that Georgia used to import wood resources from Russia, while keeping
Its own forest resources untouched is not correct (there was a period when 1,5 min. cub.m.
of timber was cut annually in Georgia).
Answer: Page 65 of Georgian version / page 51 of English version
The source of information is the National Environmental Action Plan 2000, approved by
the Presidential Decree n0 191, date May 20, 2000. Reference 49
Also the statement " Most Georgia's forests are still categorized as protected forests" needs
clarifying (A great part of the forests belongs to the category of limited Forest use regime, the
other part belongs to the protected forests category).
Answer: Page 65 of Georgian version /page 51 of English version
This comment is reflected in the core text
Further, on the same page: what is the reason of the conclusion "Most harvesting is
therefore illegal"?
Answer: Page 65 of Georgian version ,'page 51 of English version
Due to a translation mistake, "therefore" was interpreted as "however". It has been
corrected.
2. p. 130, which decrees of the President of Georgia and the Chairman of the State
Department, were not included in the Forest Code.
Answer: Page 133 of Georgian version / page 100 of English version (footnote)
For example:
-  Presidential Decree on Establishment of "Georgia Forest Sector Development
Center" as a legal entity of Civil Code (29.10.2000).
-  Head of the SFDM issued Decree n 10/53 on 23.09.2000, on "Approval of rules on
form, issuance and registration of Forest use licences"
Which normative acts have been abolished since the Code was enforced;
Answer: Page 133 of Georgian version / page 100 of English version (footnote)
According to article 119 of the Forest Code, the following normative acts were
announced cancelled after enactment of the Forest Code:
-  Forest Code of Georgia approved by the Law of December 21, 1978,
-  Law on Arranging Forest Use on the territory of Georgia, approved on June 25,
1998
What does the statement " The Forest Code is de facto not effective" mean?
Answer: Page 133 of Georgian version /page 100 of English version (footnote)
Number of new regulations should have been issued for enactment of the Forest Code,
refer to articles 116 to 120. Today, more than half of these needed regulations have still
to be issued. On the same way, some existing regulations had to be cancelled or
adjusted, as for example:
1



-  Presidential Decree n479 of 24.07.1996 on "Rules of allocation of standing timber"
(Article 116,  b.g) was not cancelled, although new Forest Code considers
issuance of the new Presidential Decrees regarding this issue (which was not done).
-  Article 118 of the Forest Code: Adjusting a Normative Act to This Code after its
Enactment. Till now, Presidential decree no 64 of January 28, 1997 "On Establishing
an Inter-Agency Expert Council for Licensing Use of Plant Resources (Forest
Resources Inclusive) in Georgia was not adjusted, although one month period was
allocated by the Forest Code.
Absolutely impossible to agree with the conclusion, that " The Forest Code is so intricate that
its enforcement will be difficult. It might be not useful to mitigate negative environmental
impacts and generate positive social benefits".
Answer: Page 133 of Georgian version /page 100 of English version (footnote)
Although SDFM admits that the text of the Forest Code is complicate, it disagrees with
the fact that the code might not be useful to mitigate negative environmental impact and
generate positive social benefits.
The Forest Code compiles both concepts and detailed descriptions of procedures.
According to intemational experience this leads to difficulties in regulations'
implementation.
Par. 1.2 What rules are implied?
Answer: Page 133 of Georgian version /page 100 of English version (footnote)
Refer to the footnote 21 on the same page
Par. 1.3 " Regulations for long term planning of forest resources shall be created" -sounds
ambiguous.
Answer: Page 133 of Georgian version /page 100 of English version (footnote)
The previous Forest Code of 1978, had been defining "long term planning of forest
resources", however it does not appear in the new Forest Code of 2000.
3. p.132. The second par. The idea is hard to understand. It is unacceptable to make
assumptions in the final report. The penalties in Georgia are occasionally 5-10 and 15 times
as high as taxes.
Answer: Page 134 of Georgian version /page 101 of English version (footnote)
The Georgian translation has been improved to better correspond to the English text.
The fact is that today in Georgia, if police, or official, catches someone, the real risk to
pay the official penalty is rather low, as the case will be easily solved by a bribe.
Further -The last sentence -What special regulation was developed in the MoE.
Answer: Page 136 of Georgian version /page 102 of English version
As it is obvious from the title ("Issue 5: legal basis for environmental impact assessment
(EIA) and environmental permits') and the content of the chapter, the MoE developed
special regulation on Procedures of implementation of the EIA.
4. p. 165.- "Laboratory Zone" does not include Mestia region: why?
Answer: Page 168 of Georgian version /page 127 of English version
The Laboratory Zone was initially defined in the ToR as composed by five districts, but
Mestia was removed from the Lab Zone upon request of the PPU, on December 15,
2000, as the mission of consultants was already prepared and the head of Mestia
region was already prepared to welcome in Zugdidi.

Refer to definition page viii, Page 5, Page 9, Figure 1 and 2, Page 16, Page 18, Page
27. Etc.
The statement that " Forest management plans cannot be used for environmental
monitoring" is not clear;
Answer: Page 168 of Georgian version /page 127 of English version
As given in the text, the traditional forest management plans are not providing socio-
economic and environmental information in a form suitable to trace changes of the
forest conditions and long-term monitoring.
what is implied by definitions: "Standing volume is estimated on the basis of a" limited and
subjective choice of samples" or " Harvesting operations are not recorded in the
management plans or maps".
Answer: Page 168 of Georgian version / page 127 of English version
Information coming from the local forestry practices
5. p. 168. Issue 16- Additional measure 16. It is difficult to agree with the authors unless they
substantiate the idea.(" Absence of information on the changing of the Forest fund").
Answer: Page 168 of Georgian version I page 127 of English version
??
6. pp.174-175. What is the reason of the statement concerning intensive / forest exploitation,
illegal wood cutting, influence of poor harvesting technique on the environment.
Answer: Page 178 of Georgian version / page 135 of English version
Answer is in the text and footnote
7. p. 176. The conclusions of paragraph 8.2. are obscure. What is the reasoning? The same
applies to issue 21 and the mitigation measures.
Answer: Page 179 of Georgian version / page 135 of English version
Refer to  8.1 and  2.2
8. p.234. par.14.3 sub par. land 2. The context is impossible to understand.
Answer: Page 236 of Georgian version / page 181 of English version
Chapter 14 has been changed already

Comments
On the Georgian version of the ACTA Draft Report
< Laboratory Zone o> - Sector Assessment of Environment
L. Chochua
Head of Inventory and Forest Use Administration
1  Quality of translation is rather poor. There are too many vague terms and sentences, it should be
seen whether the original (English) is such too.
Answers: All these comments have been discussed after the Draft Report submission and
needed changes have been done
2. "Laboratory Zone" sometimes is presented by four regions, sometimes - by five (including Mestia
region):
Answer: The Laboratory Zone was initially defined in the ToR as composed by five districts, but
Mestia was removed from the Lab Zone upon request of the PPU, on December 15, 2000, as the
mission of consultants was already prepared and the head of Mestia region was already prepared
to welcome in Zugdidi.
3. If the assessment deals with "Laboratory Zone' then what fore are the data about the development of
forestry sector of all Georgia?
Answer: De facto, the study deals with forestry sector, and to restrict the investigation, mainly for
baseline data, the geographical area has been limited to the Laboratory Zone.
4. The goal, contents and purpose of this document are not clear .(lt should be given in introduction,
from the very beginning). No criteria of evaluation are given (typical or juridical), which are to define
the conformity of environment of the project to them.
Answer: Due to number of visible misunderstanding, a "Foreword" has been added into the final
report, as well as the Guidelines of the World Bank on SEA.
5. There are many reiterations of data and texts. The account should be arranged different succession.
Answer: Different structure could have been envisaged for the report, the proposed one gives a
clear view of the situation following the main subjects to be treated.

specialists. In such a case there would be no illogical and unqualified discourses and conclusions.
Answer: -
7. The concrete comments are as follows:
a) p. 5 The terms are often vague and unclear;

dictionary, but a compilation of the general understanding of the key-words used in the report.
b) p. 9 The Lab. Zone forests area (460000ha) is not given correctly and this section says almost
nothing;
Answer Reference is made from the executive summary, the sub-paragraph "description of the
Laboratory Zone" in the paragraph 2.3 gives a complete description, taking into account some
corrections.
c) p. 10, point 4. The forests are not alienated only by the State Forestry Department.
Answer: Reference is made to the executive summary. The complete description of Forests
ownership is given in the chapter 5.
d) p.11 point 6. The reason of the conclusion in the first paragraph needs clarifying;

f) p.12 7 criteria of the Montreal process should be included in the report.
Answer: It has been annexed in the Final Report, as Annex 7

Major Comments
on the Georgian Version of the ACTA Project
Dr. Pr. N. Beruchachvili
National Coordinator of Inventory
The project has been complied without accomplishment of the substantial field researches.
Answer: A Sectoral Environmental Assessment is not requiring substantial fieldwork researches, as
it is not an academic research. It is mainly a compilation of existing documents and, if identified.
evaluation of gaps In missing data.
For that reason, there are actually no new data on the Lab. Zone.
Answer: As written above, no new field data were expected
The first volume represents a complication (and in the given case not a very good one) of the already
available materials.
Answer: -
It doesn't contain any references to previous operations.
Answer: The chapter 15 "References and Bibliography" gives a list of all documents used during the
elaboration of the report, including the one referring to components of other projects.
The Lab. Zone is well investigated
Recently, thanks to the Soros Grant, the Racha- Lechkumi -Kvemo Svaneti Compiter Atlas has been
complied, coinciding entirely with the Lab.Zone. Not a single word mentioned about it
Answer: This document was not needed
There are neither references, nor even comments on the N. Beruchashvili Report (1999- 2000) concerning
specifications of the Central Caucasus that had been made in relation to the Protected Territories Project;
Answer: Reference is given under number 58 in the Chapter 15, with reference to the World Bank. It
is to be mentioned that the GIS developed for this study was refused to be given.
not to mention the absence of investigations being carried out in connection with the Oni district landscape
-ecological carcass (in year 2000), nor any other similar investigations.
Answer: out of the scope of work
Detailed remarks:
Section -Relief (pp 35-38)
Represents a compilation of the Report made by N. Beruchashvili in 2000.
Answer: According to the ToR, which are given in the annexes, part of the work having to be done
was defined as assessment of existing documents. Reference is given under number 58 in the
Chapter 15, with reference to the World Bank.
It has no references at all to original sources of literature (works of L. Maruashvili, Geo- Morphology of
Georgia etc ).
Answer: all document used during the carrying out of the report are listed in the chapter 15
Mistakes were made when translating from Russian.
Answer: Reference is probably done to the document referenced number 58, which was in English.
No document in Russian was used

Recommendations on improving environment influencing aspects are given in the second volume of the
ACT A report. In most cases such recommendations are rather general and well-known through manuals
as well as mentioned in the reference-books and standard norms for environment preservation.
Answer:
A small paragraph dealing with Geo-information-Systems in the ACTA report can be named as a positive
one. However, there are no software products attached to the report that could assist in judgment on
completed research works
Answer: A GIS was developed, and given in soft version, out of the scope of work, by ACTA to the
PIU.
What is more, they deal with only a minor part of the Laboratory Zone, but at least the same work should
have been done for the complete Oni region, and have it attached to the report.
Answer: Good reading the Foreword, of the definition of a Sectoral Environmental Assessment as
well as of the ToR. integrally given in the annexes, would have probably prevent such confusion.

Georgian Forest Sector Development Project
Comments
on the Georgian Version of the ACT A Report
"Sectoral Environmental assessment"
G.Gigauri
Director of the Mountain Forestry Institute
B. Tvaradze
Head of the Laboratory of the Mountain Forestry Institute
The report is devoted to the Laboratory Zone: Racha-Lechxumi-Kvemo Svaneti- "sector" environmental
assessment. The report is consists of two parts (about 250 pages) and a summary.
Comment: a third volume "Annexes" is an integrant part of the report
From the beginning it must be noted, that the report can't correspond the title "Sectoral Environmental
assessment", because there is not concretized what typical features of the Lab. Zone it meant for study
and hence, there is not made concrete conclusions too. More over, if we discuss by the title of the English
version, the justified title of the Georgian versions would be "Estimation of the sectoral environment", as
the report is about one, large sector of Georgian forests, particularly: Racha- Lechxumi- Kvemo Svaneti
region.
Comments: The Sectoral Environmental Assessment is defined in different places in the report,
as for example in "Definition of terms used in the report" page ix, in the "Foreword" page 1, in the
 1.4 "Objectives of the SEA, page 10, and World Bank Guidelines regarding SEA are annexed.
The word "Sectoral" does not refer to a geographical area, but to an economical sector. The
indication of the Laboratory Zone is given as a restriction in terms of baseline data and local
investigation.
The proposed report is full of repetitions, abstract, common phrases and conclusions, it represents too big
volume, that is unjust, as there is much materials which have no relation with the environment of the
"sector"; hence, practically using it will be within the limits of the possible.
Comments: see previous comment
The Georgian version of the report is not enclosed with the executors and the consultants list which we
could find in the English version.
Comments: refer to annex 1 of the Volume "Annexes"
Unfortunately, the Mountain Forestry Institute is riot mentioned in this list. It is not clear how it was
estimated such large region of Georgia without The Mountain Forestry Institute, while the Institute of
Botany and the Plant Protection Institute have taken part in it.
Comments: -
In the report is not clear, what field works were fulfilled for finding out of this or that question.
Comments: According to the definition given above and the scope of the consultants, given in
annexes, no in-deep field-works were planned, and only a reconnaissance mission was organised
in the Laboratory Zone. It has to be said that the period dedicated to the study work, winter, was a
considerable obstacle for mountain forest investigation.
The Georgian version of the report from the point of view of linguistic or terminology is unstylized, the
ideas of many paragraphs are unclear and the conclusions are so general (and often unclear), that it may
be used in each report.
Comments: following this comments, the consultants, double check the Georgian version,
together with the different specialist listed in the annexes, two translators and one philologist.
More detailed notes will take us too far, therefore we'll dwell on some of hem:
1



1. From the point of view of terminology, there are many misunderstandings; e.g. the explanations of
"Environmental assessment", " Environmental sectoral assessment" and "The environmental impact
assessment" -are vague and translation from English is rather poor.
Comments: these definitions are coming from general documents of the World Bank
It is obscure, why is explained from the sorts of forest felling only "Thinning" and "Clear cutting". To say
noting of vagueness of the explanation, final cutting is not permitted in our forests and putting it in this
report is out of place.
Comments: Making reference to the Chapter XV of the Forest Code. Article 68 and 70 are giving
definition of categories of Final Cuts, and Clear Cuts is one of it.
The explanations of the terms " timber" and "wood" are not correct.
Comments: -
The term " Silvicultural care " in Georgian means "Forestry activities";
Comments: -
instead of "forest cutting in the road building ", the term "Cutting during the road building' should be used.
Comments: In that specific case, the word "cutting" does not refer to tree cutting, but to the
excavation needed by the road construction.
Generally it is obscure, what do the words "Take the cream from the forests" mean? maybe the authors
mean here increasing of the timber.
Comments: The word "creaming" has to be taken as an imaged form, meaning 'lo take the best
of'
The terms " vascular", "habitat" and so on. are not correct.
Comments: -
In this respect many questions are to be corrected.
2. According to the project objectives, it is quite superfluous the data about the protected areas (pp. 102-
108),
Comments: An integrated forest management planning has to integrate such kind of elements,
subsequently it was thought to be needed.
extractions from the " Constitution of Georgia" and from other Georgian rules (pp. 110-173), as they have
not a direct dependence to the assessment of this Lab. Zone.
Comments: refer to second comment on the objectives and definition of a SEA
3. The characteristics of the Lab. Zone biodiversity are amorphous and not concrete, for example, There is
first conversation about flora biodiversity and then is given the characteristics of the Lab. Zone's Botany-
Geography originality. (it must be on the contrary). On the whole, when estimating the biodiversity of the
Lab. Zone, concrete conclusions and recommendations are not given.
Comments: Chapter 2.4 is a compilation of baseline data, which is not to lead to specific
conclusion
4. The materials, connected to the Lab. Zone includes chapters 8-13. They are full of general phrases and
do not contain clear and concrete determinations, e.g. In the table N 8.1.4. which concerns to non-timber
productions, the units of measure are not even pointed.
Comments: the units are [to/year], and were unfortunately skipped during the translation
5. At the end of the report schedules and conclusions are full of such curious sentences as:
2



Comments: These remarks might come from the analysis of the table 13.2.3,   summarising the
identified issues and the proposed mitigation measures
"Risk of flood and erosion for a low areas".
Comments: -
Bogging up or forming puddles as a result of forest management".
Comments: -
Forest management and a sexual dividing problem".
Comments: The original word which is misunderstood is "Gender" which seems to be   largely
accepted in such a context.
Road building is not allowed in slope zones".
Comments: The original sentence is " In zones with too steep slopes or/and instable
geological condition, no roads shall be built.
In the road building process the remnants of the timber must be carried out to a place of sweepings,
which is on a safe place."
Comments: The original sentence is "Excess cut material (meaning extraction material) must be
transported to the planned earth dumps located on safe grounds
6. In the resume, however, together with a lot of misunderstandings, such recommendations, like
ultimatum, are given: Georgian Government can't receive a credit from the World Bank without such a
project, without fulfilment of a scenario, as the "Sectoral Environmental assessment" is; and without
abolishing illegal cutting, which causes utter amazement.
Comments: Reference is made to the Chapter 14 "Conclusion - Tentative Scenario Comparison.
7. As it is seen from the notes above, the proposed report needs processing and refining with suitable
specialists' participate.

Dear Sir,
The Georgian Forestry Department, with support of the World Bank, is preparing the Forestry Sector
Development National Program. As it states in the introduction, the program represents the outcome of the
several missions of the WB and FAO Investment Center.
The Georgian Environmental non-govemmental organizations, after the careful review and wide discussion of the
document, would like to express our great concerns regarding the activities that would be carried out according
to this programme.
First of all, we would like to underline that the program generally is in contradiction to UN Biodiversity Convention
and principles of sustainable development. It is mainly focused on full utilization of forest timber resources and
less attention is paid to the issue of forest ecosystems conservation. In this letter we would like to emphasize the
problem issues that we consider most significant.
Volume of Logging
From the project document: " The Department desires to increase the annual volume of logging by the year 2005
to 1 mln cubic meters. (2.2 article)." The logic of the argument is that: summarized mean increment is 3.9 mln m3
and the actual cutting is only 400 000 i3. In the same document the data of the Ministry of Environment (that is
not considered as official data?!), indicate that annual cutting of forest timber in Georgia amounts to 2.5 min m3
(legal plus illegal logging). We consider the data of the Ministry of Environment more accurate because it reflects
the real situation regarding the level of destroyed forests in Georgia. Based on this data, it is clear that without a
significant improvement of the forest management system, the proposed logging will increase to 1 million m3 and
will result in complete degradation of Georgian forest resources. To support this concem, same project shows
that 40% (2.2 mln ha) of Georgian Territory is classified as State Forest. Total volume of Standing Forests is
434,000,000 m3 and summarized mean increment is 3. 9,000 miln m3. Calculating the average volume and
growth, the standing trees average volume is about 197 m3/ha, by the summarized mean increaof about 1.8 m3.
It must be taken into consideration, that according to the legislation in force (new Forestry Code, 1999, and
related other), forest cutting is not allowed on the specific territories of state forest, including:
* Forest covered territories under the supervision of Department of Natural Resources and under the
Protected- and Hunting Areas -168,000 ha
* Degraded areas (200 000 ha);
* Reserve (31 600 ha), that need urgent restoration;
* Flood Forests;
* Resort and Green Zones, falling under the specific protection regime (Forestry Code article 41) and at
* Forest covered slopes (more than 350).
Therefore, the territory where the logging is allowed is, in fact, less than 2,200,000 ha. Apart from this, in the
project it has been shown that before the adoption of the new Forestry Code (1999) the use of only 30% of forest
territory (600,000 ha) was allowed. After the adoption of the Code the forest logging will be increased
significantly. That in itself is a negative fact. If the commercial use will reach even 50% (1,100,000 ha) of the
2



State Forest territory, the related estimated annual growth will be 1,980 min m3. This figure will be even smaller,
if taking into consideration the fact also mentioned in the project that the middle age forests area where the
logging is to be undertaken covers only 48% and the mature forest - only 30% of the territory where logging is
allowed. In the best scenario, the forest territory under the legal logging will make up only 78% (858 000 ha).
Accordingly, the annual growth for this territory could be estimated as 1,6 min m3, instead of 3.9 mln m3, and,
respectively, the standing trees volume -as 169 min m3, instead of 434 mln m3.
It must be taken into account too, that a significant part of Georgian forests is located in Aphkhasia and South
Ossetia regions, where the separatist governance and where the Forestry Department definitely has controlling
problems. In fact, this further reduces the actual areas under permitted logging.
Based on the above facts, the arguments given in the forestry Project are overestimated. The real situation is
much more severe. Due to the actual hard socio-economic conditions, especially the acute energy crisis, the
forest resources of the country came under significant pressure through uncontrolled timber cutting by the local
population for heating/cooking use and, by country-wide illegal cutting of timber designated for illegal trade
(export).
The forest-covered areas are drastically shrinking in Georgia every day. Due to the fact that forest inventory does
not carried out for several years, data does not accurately reflect the real situation. Also, two main govemmental
bodies who manage the utilization of forest resources, Ministry of Environment and Forestry Department, are
reporting significantly questionable and at times conflicting data.
Our strong belief is that the first priority in Georgia must be the inventory of existing forest resources. Only after
this activity is complete, is possible to start thinking about the utilization volume, applying for credit.
Allocation of funds
On another issue, the allocation of funds in the program is also not acceptable: 37 mln USD credit investment is
placed without inflation and taxes. Is Georgia able to cover the credit in appropriate time, or will it be a long-term
loan, permanently imposed on next generations? Meanwhile, the total amount of credit would be increased due
to the inflation rate and taxes. Covering the credit by the incomes of the proposed project is very problematic
because it includes the highest risks for the state (population).
Another issue is the allocation of funds by the program components: institutional development - 43%,
afforestation and deforestation - 25%, forest management and protection - 6%, development of transport and
logging facilities 23%, non-timber product production, facilitation of hunting and tourism -3%. From these figures,
it is clear that the bigger part of credit is allocated to the institutional development (creation of central and
regional offices and equipment, creation of business center) and for logging. It is not clear what is meant under
"forest management". The forest management should be the essential component of institutional development.
To the contrary, this component has lost all sense and looks very artificial.
There is no assurance that 'institutional development of existing Forestry Department" could even theoretically
contribute to the improvement of the actual forest resources management in Georgia.
Forest Protection
Concerning the forests protection part of proposed project: the only issue addressed is fighting against the forest
diseases. The conservation aspects are supposed to be implemented through the WB/GEF project "Caucasian
Mountainous Forests Biodiversity Conservation" only (Annex 5, para 32).
The funds allocated for afforestation (1 769 000 USD) will be added to the already enormous amount allocated
for institutional development (restoration of seed center and nursery Gardens development - annex 5, Fl and F2
components). Yet, forest restoration works must be implemented with 'corridor- and 'window- technique" (annex
5, comp.4.) This means, that first the forest should be cut and then it will be restored? The logical question is: Is
this a restoration?
Along with these issues, serious concems arise in connection with the proposed increase of the timber prices
(article 4). Taking into consideration the actual socio-economic situation of the Georgian population and the
energy crisis, it's clear that it would be impossible for the population to purchase timber and illegal cutting will
increase. That will increase the pressure on forests, but not the fiscal incomes of Ministry of Finance, as it states
in the project.
Conclusion
In conclusion we would summarize our the concems about the 'Georgia forestry sector development program" as
follows:
3



1. The project is oriented only to utilization. Forest conservation (sustainable use) aspects are fully ignored;
2. In the proposed program implementation the Georgia forests will be in great danger, with probable total loss
of commercial forest resources;
3. Considering the forest as a multi-component ecosystem (species, population and so on) is fully ignored. The
implementation of the proposed program principles would endanger the existence of many species,
populations and, as a result, the forest itself as an ecosystem.
4. Proposed programs oppose the principles of sustainable development, Biodiversity Convention, Landscape
and Biodiversity Pan-European Strategy and other international agreements and provisions.
5. Despite the fact underlined in the reviewed text that WB-/lnternational Experts contributed to the program
preparation, many arguments in favor of this program document appear to be weak or incomplete, as cited in
our letter.
It is our strong belief that there is an urgent need for revising the document to address our concerns and to take
into account the principles of sustainable development, Biodiversity Convention, Landscaped and Biodiversity
Pan-European Strategy and other international agreements and provisions, also by involving more high qualified
experts.
We look forward to receiving a response to our comments within the next month . If you would like to discuss any
issues or have questions about this letter, we would be happy to meet with you.

GEORGIA
FORESTS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SECTORAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
(Project Preparation Grant JPN 25144-GE)
Terms of Reference
I.    Introduction. The Government of Georgia (GoG) has requested that the World Bank (the Bank) ) provide suppon for a FOTests
Development Project (the Project). This Project will help the GoG to establish sound forest management systems that would maximize
the contribution of Georgia's forests to economic development and rural poverty reduction on an environmentally sustainable basis. The
Project is of critical importance to Georgia's forests and people. With the enactment of the new Forest Code of Georgia in June 1999,
Georgia has adopted a legal framework and roadmap for transition to market principles of forest economy, including its possible
privatization, while safeguarding the critical environmental, social and cultural functions of the nation's forests. The Project that will be
implemented in 2001-2008 is designed to provide critical support to this ambitious transition. The total project cost estimate is about
US$30 million dollars equivalent and will be financed by the GoG, the World Bank, Japan and, possibly, the European Union and other
intemational and bilateral donors.
2.      To support preparation of the proposed Project, the GoG seeks the services of intemationally qualified consultant(s) to prepare
a Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SEA) 1 which will be consistent with the GoG environmental procedures and the requirements of
the Bank as outlined in Operational Policy 4.01 "Environmental Assessment" (attachment A).
3.      The project has been placed in the Bank environmental screening category "B." However, the GoG seeks to undertake a
Sectoral Environmental Assessment which will also fulfill the requirements of the Bank's environmental screening category "A,"
including information disclosure and public consultations. As a significant focus of Project implementation is to promote policy
development, it is expected analyses on the sectoral environmental impact will continue as policies and forests-related programs evolve.
4.     Background Information. The proposed Forests Development Project is expected to be appraised by the World Bank in March
2001 and submitted for World Bank's Board approval in July 2001. The Project will have the following five complementary and inter-
related components:
(a)     development and improvement of nationalforesi policies. laws and regulations (including forest sector institutional
reorganization plans and financial system reform plans);
(b)     development and improvement offorest management planning systems (including forest inventory, landscape-
ecological zoning and environmental and social assessments for forest conservation and multiple-purpose use, forest
management information systems, economic valuation and pricing of forest resources, effective forest fire and pest
management, reforestation and afforestation, and community participation in forest management);
(c)     strengthening offorest sector institutions and human resources development (including training and re-training of
professional forest management staff, forest research and education, public awareness campaigns for rural
c.ommunities and general population);
(d)     support to private sector in sustainableforest management and utilization (including assistance with development
and demonstration of environmentally sustainable forest harvesting and transportation techniques, training in forest
road planning, maintenance and rehabilitation, training in preparation of environmental impact assessments and
public consultations for private projects); and,
(e)     promotion of sustainable use of non-woodforest products (including development of sustainable hunting and
ecotourism in forest ecosystems).
5.     Substantial technical work detailing each component was completed in 1998-99 by the SFD together with the FAO specialists.
Additional preparation work (including Overall forest utilization planning, Social Assessment, and this Sectoral EA study) is being
financed by a Japanese project preparation grant and has to be completed before project appraisal. The remaining critical preparation
and stan-up activities for the Project including: (i) development of improved forest policies and regulations; (ii) development of
improved forest management planning and protection techniques; and (iii) project implementation capacity building - are being funded
through a project preparation advance (PPF) in September 2000 to July 2001.
6.      Project implementation will be carried out in the following way. The Forestry Development Fund (FDF) - a project
preparation unit established under the SFD that is currently administering the Japanese Grant, will be used as the core of the new Project
Management Unit (PMU) that will be established in August-September 2000 by a decree of the President of Georgia. Administration of
the remainder of the Japanese grant will also be transferred to this new entity. The PMU will be established as a legal person under
Georgia's civil law and its Executive Director will be nominated by the Ministry of Finance and SFD and appointed by the President.
I       Depending on the project, a range of instruments can be used to satisfy the Bank's EA requirement: environmental impact assessment (EIA),
regional or sectoral EA, environmental audit, hazard or risk assessment, and environmental management plan (EMP). When the project is likely to have
sectoral or regional impacts, sectoral or regional EA is required. A Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SEA) is an instrument which offers opportunities
for sector-wide environmental analysis and support integration of environmental concerns into long-term development and investment planning. SEAs are
particularly suited for reviewing (a) the effect of sectoral policy changes; (b) sector investment alternatives; (c) institutional capacity and requirements for
environmental review, implementation and monitoring at the sectoral level; and (d) cumulative impacts of many relatively small, similar investments
which by themselves may not appear to have significant environmental impact. World Bank guidance on sectoral EA can be found in OP 4.01, the
EnvironmentalAssessmentSourcebook(1991) and the October 1993 EnvironmentalAssessmentSourcebook Update(Number4).



Georgia Forests Development Project                  - 4 -               Sectoral Environmental Assessment
Terms-of-Reference
The PMLU will report to a twelve-member Supervisory Board that will include representatives of the Ministries of Economy, Finance,
ALriculture, and Environment, SFD, State Department of Protected Areas, State Department of Land Management, Parliamentary
Committee on Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, Georgian Academy of Sciences, and non-govemmental organizations.
The first stage of the Project will focus on implementing land-use and forest management planning activities agreed to by all
interested stakeholders during project preparation and early stages of implementation. After sufficient dialogue and analyses, later stages
of implementation will focus more directly on forest sector investments, with an increasingly important role played by the private sector.
Work on land-use planning and forest management information systems will, however, continue for the duration of the Project and
beyond. An environmental management plan (EMP) for project implementation will have to be developed as part of this study. This
EMP will provide a process by which specific environmental impact assessments will be conducted for each of the Project's
subcomponents before they are financed by the Bank. Guidelines for sustainable forest management in a format that can act as a
sourcebook for forest managers and which are consistent with the FAO Model Code of Forest Harvesting Practice will also be developed
dunng project implementation. These will include not only guidelines for environmentally friendly silvicultural and harvesting
operations, but also guidelines for the EIA of forestry practices on forest biodiversity, ecosystems-based inventories, but also for the
establishment of forest lands Landscape Ecological Networks. These will culminate in the preparation of sustainable forest management
1 0-year plan guidelines.
8.      The Implementing Agency for the Project is the Georgian State Department of Forest Management. Financing for Project
preparation commenced in July, 1998. Significant analysis (including legal analysis) and proposals for Project financing were developed
in partnership with FAO. A Social Assessment was carried out in August-December 1999 and its results were published in July 2000.
The World Bank is also preparing the GEF-financed Georgia Protected Areas Development Project (PADP) in coordination with the
Forests Development Project.
9.      It is envisaged that the FD Project will be appraised in March 2001 and presented to the World Bank Board of Directors in July
2001, before becoming effective in October 2001. The SEA must therefore be completed before February 2001 so that the findings and
recommendations can be incorporated into Project design before its appraisal.
10.     Objectives. The objectives of the SEA are to (i) analyze the policy, legal and administrative framework relevant to the forest
sector and make recommendations for reform if needed; (ii) identify major environmental and social issues related to the development of
the forest sector; (ii) collect baseline data in relation to these environmental and social issues and their trends; (iii) analyze potential
impacts from proposed Project activities vis a vis alternative programs, particularly for long-term sustainable development, and make
recommendations for mitigation if necessary; (iv) analyze in-country capacity for environmental management and assessment in the
sector; (v) provide general guidelines for long-term sector-wide environmental monitoring; and (vi) assist in inter-agency coordination
and public/NGO consultation process.
II.     Environmental Assessment Requirements. The following regulations and guidelines should guide the assessment and assist in
specifying the content of the final report:
*    World Bank Operational Policy (OP) and Bank Procedure (BP) 4.01: Environmental Assessment;
*    World Bank Operational Policies on Forestry (4.36), Natural Habitats (OP 4.04), and Cultural Heritage (OP 4.11);
*    Law of Georgia on State Environmental Assessment
*    Other national, region provincial or communal laws and/or regulations on environmental reviews and impact
assessments;
*    Draft Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan
*    World Bank EnvironmentalAssessment Sourcebook (1991) and the October 1993 Environmental Assessment
Sourcebook Update (Number 4).
12.     Scope of Work. The SEA should be carried out in an open and participatory manner involving consultations with all the major
stakeholders. Specific tasks will include the following:
13.     Task 1. Project description and identification of major environmental and social issues related to the development of the forest
sector and the Project.
14.     Task 2. Baseline data and monitorin . Assemble, evaluate and present baseline data in relation to these environmental and
social issues, and include information on any changes anticipated in the near future. Whereas a project-specific EA would describe
impacts around a proposed project site, the SEA should concentrate on the issues and problems that are typical of the sector as a whole.
This may include information on the physical environment, biological environment and socio-cultural environment. It may also include
the identification and current management practices on ecologically sensitive areas, information on land and resource use (including non-
timber forest products), systems of land tenure and resource use rights, extent and causes of illegal harvesting at the community level,
existing and planned development activities. A more detailed subset of baseline data shall be assembled and evaluated at a local
(district) level - for the territory of the Oni District - using the results of the Overall forest utilization planning and the Landscape-
ecological zoning undertaken in 1998-2000. The consultant(s) should also closely review the results of the Social Assessment
undertaken by other consultant(s). This section of the SEA will also identify major data gaps.
15.     Task 3. Policy. Legal and Administrative Framework. Identify and analyze both the (a) national environmental legal,
regulatory and institutional framework and (b) sector-specific policies, regulations and institutions, and make recommendations for
future needs or changes.
16.     The relevant national environmental policies, laws and regulations should be assessed for their completeness and
appropriateness in light of the conditions and problems of the sector, and gaps and weaknesses noted. Non-environmental laws and

policies that have significant for the sector's utilization of resources and/or production processes should also be identified. These may
include legislation related to land restitution, tenure systems, private sector development, enforcement, judicial system or customs.
Similarly the regulatory framework for EA preparation and review of forest sector investments should be assessed (see Task 5).
I 7.    The SEA should also analyze current and proposed forest sector-specific policies, laws and regulations that have
en ironmental implications. To some degree, analysis of the Forest Code which was approved in June 1999 by the Georgian Parliament
has already been started by the FAO during project preparation. However, numerous subsidiary regulations are being developed to
support this Forest Code, and the SEA should help to identify any gaps in these implementing regulations that are critical to support
sustainable forest management (SFM). In addition, the impact of the recent (1998-99) temporary ban on commercial logging vis-a-vis
alternatives should be analyzed, with suggestions made for regulatory and/or other adjustments that would be needed to ensure that the
effective lifting of this ban after approval of the 1999 Forest Code does not lead to the acceleration of unsustainable harvesting practices.
18.     The SEA should also identify how environmental responsibilities are distributed among (public or pTivate) institutions and
assess their capacity to administer these tasks. The State Forest Department's investment planning process, in terms of objectives,
methodology and procedures for review and approval of plans and projects, should be carefully reviewed. The SEA should assess
whether environmental and social issues are adequately covered by current procedures.
19.     Task- 4. Analvze potential impacts from proposed forest sector development scenarios (includinr those outlined by the FD
Project). While one challenge for SEAs is to produce a sufficiently precise impact analysis in the face of evolving policy development,
this section of the SEA should focus on (a) comparison of alternative forest sector development scenarios proposed during project
preparation by the GoG and FAO, including a "do-nothing alternative;' (b) short-term and long-term effects of various harvesting
scenanos on forest structure, watersheds and biodiversity; (c) short-term and long-term effects of logging roads; (d) likely impacts of
developing community-forest management systems, and what systems would need to be in place to ensure communities manage their
forests sustainably; and (d) effects of the development of a forests product processing sector.
20.     If these questions cannot be answered immediately, suggest ways in which the Project or the GoG can eventually obtain this
analysis.
21.     Task 5. In-country Environmental Assessment Capacity. Analysis of capacity within the relevant ministries or departments to
run an effective EA process during forest management planning. This would include a review of the mandates and capacity of
institutions at local, provincial/regional and national levels, and recommend steps to strengthen or expand them. The recommendations
may extend to new laws and regulations, new agencies or agency functions, inter-ministerial arrangements, management procedures
and/or training, staffing and administrative re-organization.
22.     Task 6. Environmental Monitoringr and Management Plan. The SEA should provide general guidelines for long-term sector-
wide environmental monitoring, the Forest Management Information System (FMIS) which is to be funded under the Project as well as
processes by which the environmental impact of any potential future forestry operations will be assessed. Based on the informational
gaps identified in the baseline data sections, the plan should also recommend measures needed to collect and organize missing data. A
monitoring plan should use the findings of the baseline data sections to measure progress.
23.     Task 7. Consultalion. Assist in inter-agency coordination and publicfNGO participation. Coordinate the SEA with other
govemment agencies, in obtaining the view of local NGOs and affected groups, in keeping records of meetings and other activities,
communications, and comments and their disposition.
24.     Report. The SEA should be concise and limited to significant environmental issues. The main text should focus on findings,
conclusions and recommendations supported by summaries of the data collected and citations for any references used in interpreting
those data. Detailed or uninterpreted data should be presented in appendices or a separate volume. The report should be presented in
English as well as in Georgian languages. The SEA should be organized according to the outline below:
*   Executive Summary
*   Policy, Legal and Administrative Framework
*   Description of the Proposed Project and Major Environmental and/or Social Issues

Note: A Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SEA) is an instnument which offers opportunities for sector-wide environmental analysis and support integration of environmental concems into long-term development and investment
planning. The SEA therefore attempts to take a broader, landscape view of sector-wide development - and does not focus as much on investment-speciric environmental impacts (an investment-speciric EA will be conducted within the
scope of the eardy phase of the Project itself before these investments are financed by the Bank at the second phase of the Project)
