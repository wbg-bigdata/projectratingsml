percent. The clearing of forests and conversion of land to non-forest
usage;
District               Politico-administrative unit or forest management unit. The precise
use of this word and the distinction of "sub-district" or "region" depend
on the context and on the person. It can be the source of
misunderstandings. The Forest Code defines forest district as a
territory of the State Forest Fund separated out for the purposes of
better management;

Logging                The process of harvesting timber from a forest, logging has come to
be used in the context of unsustainable cutting, which is cutting that is
not focused on long-term timber supplies;
Pilot Zone             Territory surrounding of Oni area, where 3D model was made in GIS;
Protective forests     Forest areas, which are important for the protection of human life or
valuable goods against natural hazards. Not the same as "protected

Sectoral               SEA is a much needed complement to project-specific EAs in
Environmental          development planning. Where project EAs focus on the impacts of
Assessment             specific investment and often treat sector strategic planning as given,
SEA offer an opportunity for sector-wide environmental analysis
before investment priorities have been determined.
SEA avoids the inherent limitations of project-specific EAs in
addressing issues related to policy and planning and the legal and
institutional framework.
By moving upstream in the planning process to a stage where major
strategic decisions have not yet been made, SEA offers better
opportunities not only for analyzing existing policies, institutions, and
development plans in terms of environmental issues, but also for
supporting environmentally sound sectror-wide investment strategies.

or other growth on the adjoining area, and thus forming a silviculture
or management entity;
State Forest           Forest owned by the State;
State Forest Fund      Integrity of State Forests as well as lands and resources attributed to
these forests;

O  Executive summary
0.1  The Georgia Forests Development Project
The main objective of the Project is to establish sound forest management system that would
maximize the contribution of Georgia's forests to economic development and rural poverty
reduction on an environmental friendly basis.
The Project is expected to be implemented over a period of 5 to 6 years, starting in February
2002, and will include the following five components:

Social Assessment
The social study identifies major potential social impacts related with the Project
implementation and development of the forest sector, reviews and highlights social
assessment completed by GORBI, underlines issues identified by stakeholders and
proposes management and mitigation plans.
In the Laboratory Zone, one major concern is the general poverty of the population.

The poorest              50%           45,3%         23.3%          0.7%
Middle poor              32%           42%           70.7%         46.6%
The least poor           18%           12.7%          6%            52.7%
Due to the energy crisis, taking place in the 90s, excess pressure has been imposed on
forests in the vicinity of populated areas. The main source of energy is wood in the
Laboratory Zone, which is cause by the location and economic situation. Around 90% of
energy for cooking and heating of the local population comes for the wood.

Geology - Geography
Georgia is located between the southern side of the Great Caucasus and the northern side of
the Lesser Caucasus, between 43°35' and 41°03 ' latitude, and between 41°00' and 46043'
longitude.
Covering a territory of 69'700 kM2, Georgia is a typical mountainous country. About 54% of
the territory are mountains, 33% - foothills and mounds, and only 13% are occupied by
plains. The average altitude of the country's territory is 1,230 m above sea level. Almost one-
fifth of the territory is occupied by high-mountains, which explains a low demographic
density, with approximately 5 million inhabitants.
The study area (Laboratory Zone) consists of four, medium and high mountainous
administrative districts - Lentekhi, Tsageri, Oni and Ambrolauri.
Climate, the complicated relief of the region conditions the variety of climate. The following
topographic features directly affect the climate:
1. Altitude that ranges from 150 to 4,000 m;
2. Mountain massif of the Great Caucasus range as well as its adjacent ranges;
3. Existence of glaciers and snow cover in the high-mountainous part;
4. Black Sea that keeps the warmth and large amounts of precipitation within the region;
5. Distinctive division between the plain and mountainous parts of the relief, orientation of
the major ranges and their steep slopes.
Erosion is a considerable problem in the mountain areas, where along with natural
processes, significant contributions come from cultivation of steep slopes (without terracing),
impact from overgrazing and uncontrolled, disorganized cutting of trees.
Hydrography, the Central Caucasus is located within the catchments of the Rioni River,
belonging to the Black Sea Basin.
Geomorphology, according to the scheme of geomorphologic division of Georgia, Oni and
Lentekhi districts are located mainly within the zone of folded ranges and massifs, composed
by terrigenous-volcanic formations of Jurassic and Tertiary periods - represented by clay-
schists, sandstones, porphyrites, tuff breccias, rarely limestone.
Stratigraphy, the major watershed range in the Lab Zone mostly coincides with the
Caucasus geological axis. Eastwards of the Mamisoni pass the watershed range deviates
from the geological axis to the South and enter the stratigraphic-tectonic zone of the Great
Caucasus range.
Deposits of Mineral Resources, among deposits of mineral resources developed
throughout the study area, the most significant are Chordi barite deposit in the Oni district
and Lukhumi arsenic deposit in the Ambrolauri district. Except the mentioned deposits a
large deposit of manganese is located in Shkmeri (Ambrolauri district), which has been
explored geologically, but has never been exploited.
Forest Fund, Resources and Uses
The entire standing volume of the State Forest Fund in the Laboratory Zone is 47,7 million
m3, for a total area covering up to 462,000 ha.
Dominant species in the Lab Zone are: Abies nordmanniana, Picea, Pinus, Fagus, Quercus,
Carpinus, Castanea, Acer, Alnus glutinosa (alnus barbarata in mountains), Betula.

National Forests Development Project
During the last decade, due to financial restrictions, the regeneration of the forest has not
been practicc-- and the process takes places mainly naturally. Taking into account
environmenta conditions of cut areas, the regeneration with relevant species proceed
satisfactorily. It should be mentioned that natural restoration occurs only in the areas where
cattle grazing does not take place. Monitoring of natural restoration, as well as pastures, is
not carried out. An intensive cattle grazing is practiced within 2 km radius from the populated
areas. These places constitute approximately 10% of the entire forest fund i.e. 30,000 ha of
the study territory.
Biodiversity
It is quite difficult to draw a clear line between floristic and faunistic regions represented in
the Caucasus due to the mutual penetration of species. Considering biodiversity, the
Caucasus is characterized by its complex, sometimes mosaic spatial structure of biological
communities representing different biogeographic zones.
Flora and fauna are very diverse, due to the country's location.
0.3  Laws
Laws on forestry and more specifically the Forest Code provide the legal basis that has to be
improved for a real sustainable forest management. Improvements are needed to bring
forestry and environmental protection to coincide.
Considering Georgia's legal, institutional and political situation, a major characteristic is the
imperfect enforcement of existing laws.
0.4  Forest Ownership and Liability
Today, forests belong to the State and, according to the Georgian Legislation (Forest Code,
(Article 7)), in all legal affairs concerning the Forest Fund, the State is represented by the
following entities:
*  The Ministry of Environment,
*  The State Department of Forest Management,
*  The State Department of Protected Areas, Nature Reserves and Hunting Farms and
their territorial units,
* Local governing and self-governing bodies.
Property rights to the Georgian Forest Fund may be held by the State, the Patriarchy of
Georgia and a physical or legal entity by the private law.
The Georgian State Forest Fund is a State property and its privatization will be regulated by
the law "On the privatization of Georgian Forests", which is not already adopted.
0.5  Forest Management Planning
Traditional Soviet-type forest management plans have been elaborated for 10-year period,
for Oni - in 1991-92, Ambrolauri - in 1995-96, Tsageri and Lentekhi - in 1996-97. However,
due to a variety of reasons (mainly because of budgetary restrictions), they have not been
fully carried out.
Forest management plans in the broad sense (including periodic forest inventory,
classification of forest functions based on comprehensive assessment of needs and values
xii



ACTA Consultants                                         Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
of the forest resources, determination of management objectives on the basis of multiple-use
strategies, monitoring of ongoing operations and periodic updating of the plans) are needed
for the preservation of the forests and the successful development of the forest sector.
Adoption of a Forest Management Information System, elaboration of land-use plans on a
district basis and development of multiple use and sustainable forest management plans will
provide a much improved management basis, where environmental considerations can be
reflected and accounted. Mitigation measures are proposed to improve land-use planning.
Forest management planning (and control) will have positive environmental impacts if its
objectives are adhered to and its results are implemented correctly. Additional measures are
proposed for further improvement of the environmental impact of forest management
planning.
0.6  Protective, Tourist and Cultural Use
Mountain forests, such as forests of the Lab Zone, exert a protective function against natural
hazards (such as avalanches, landslides, rock falls, erosion, etc.) and this was recognized in
the traditional forest management plans, according to which all forests were classified as
protective forests of some kind. Cutting restrictions were imposed depending on the forest
conditions, but these limitations have not been stated explicitly, which is one of the main
reasons why opponents have criticized the traditional management plans.
Non-monetary value of the role of forests for protection against natural hazards of the
existing infrastructure (roads, bridges, buildings) and for tourist and cultural uses has not
been evaluated. It is probably much higher than the timber revenues.
0.7  Forest Products
Mountain forests are presently exploited (as a green mine) in an extensive way for the
extraction of various wood and non-wood products. Defective or dying trees are harvested in
small quantities and on scattered places (so called sanitary cuts) in forests accessible by
tractors. Individuals near villages and roads collect firewood. Commercial harvesting
operations make up officially less than 10% of the wood harvested.
Contrary to popular belief, according to these figures the forests are underused with regard
to wood harvesting, and the growing stock should be on the increase. Poor harvesting
techniques are to be blamed for the local degradation of forest conditions, for soil erosion on
steep slopes and soil compaction. In addition, illegal wood cutting (wood harvested without
official permit) is taking place in various ways and places. The extent of these illegal activities
is unknown (with estimates for the Lab Zone varying from a low 3'500 m3 to unsubstantiated
claims as high as 100'000 m3 per year).
0.8  Infrastructure and Wood Harvesting System
Infrastructure (roads, buildings) and wood harvesting systems (skidders, skyline ropeways,
trucks, chainsaws, etc.) used for tending and harvesting the forest resources of the Lab Zone
are rudimentary and in acute need of repair and maintenance. The same is true for the main
district roads connecting towns in the valleys.
The Forests Development Project would finance a demonstration program of low-impact
harvesting and transportation systems, as well as forest road rehabilitation (190 km in the
Laboratory Zone) and construction (40 km) program, using equipment and construction
methods minimizing the impact on sensitive landscapes and ecotypes. Training in the use of
environmentally friendly road construction and harvesting systems will be financed.

0.9   Biodiversity and Landscape
Thanks to the diversity of the natural conditions (altitude, exposition, soils, water availability)
characteristic of this mountainous region, the Central Caucasus, is that it represents a shelter
for many species of flora and fauna.
Existing reports show lack of solid data on fauna. Nevertheless, indices show decreases in
large mammals' populations (some of which must now be considered as endangered) due to
poaching.
The present forest use patterns have complex, both positive and negative impacts on
biodiversity. It is hereby important to underline the difference between deforestation and
logging (see Definitions at the beginning of the report). Deforestation, a process that would
constitute one of the severest threats to biodiversity, is nowadays hardly found in the Lab
Zone. On the contrary, the total forest area is probably increasing in the region.
0.10 Sustainable Forest Management
The concept of "sustainable development" has become widely accepted on the international
policy level. Some definitions put the emphasis rather on its growth aspect, such as:
economic growth that benefits present and future generations without adversely affecting
biological and other natural resources'. Others rather underline the social and the
environmental dimensions: improving the quality of human life while living within the carrying
capacity of supporting ecosystem2. The concept of 'Sustainable Forest Management" enjoys
similarly a global consensus on the general policy level.
It appeared quite soon that more precise definitions are necessary, which take into account
the diversity of situations. Different international processes are attempting to settle precise
criteria and indicators with which it will be possible for a country to assess its own situation
and improvements. The discussions iead in the Montreal Process, as they dealt with
temperate and boreal forests, may be of interest for Georgia and gave a general framework
for the present study. The 7 criteria used in the Montreal Process were used as a framework
to gather the data on which the present study is based.
0.11  Public Participation
According to the Chapter X of the Forest Code, representatives of population and public
organizations have a right to:
a) receive full, reliable and timely information on current condition of the State Forest
Fund;
b) fully participate in the planning of forest management of the State Forest Fund (Article
35.1).
At present, no detailed procedure for ensuring public participation in decision-making
process exists.
Available reports do not mention any participation in the forest management planning taking
place in the 90s in the Laboratory Zone.
In order to ensure sustainability and effectiveness of the Forests Development Project in long
term, considerable attention should be paid to public participation issues.

0.12 Environmental Management Plan and Monitoring Guidelines
This chapter presents the environmental management plan and monitoring guidelines, which
have been developed in response to the analysis of impacts. These guidelines incorporate
revealed, ecological, social, geological, etc. cumulative impacts, propose mitigation and
monitoring measures to each of them and propose institutional roles and responsibilities in
relation to each of the mitigation and monitoring measures.
The environmental management plan and monitoring guidelines developed for the different
components of the proposed Project are presented in the following tables.
0.13 Conclusions - Tentative Scenario Comparison
The Sectoral Environmental Assessment of the forest sector in the "Laboratory Zone" has
brought to light that the presence of forests is overwhelming and forests are increasing area
wise.
Forests are very diverse not only in their composition, structure and productivity (growth
potential and timber quality), but also in their functions (roles) and represent a shelter for a
rich biodiversity. If the forests were managed in an optimal way, they could have contributed
much more to the regional development by providing local employment, revenues for local
communities, wood energy for the local population, raw material for wood processing
industries as well as an attractive environment for the tourism, habitat for the wildlife and
protection from natural hazards.
The present situation differs from the optimum:-
forests are exploited in a haphazard way by the population for firewood and
selectively "creamed" by poachers for exportation of high quality timber, mainly to
Turkey;
the silvicultural operations scheduled in the management plans are not carried out;
- official forest revenues are sent to the central State Budget, without retaining a real
benefit for the local economy.
ANALYSIS OFALTERNATIVES
"Existing project" scenario",
The project development objective is to "establish Sustainable Forest Management Systems,
which would maximize the contribution of forests to economic development and rural poverty
reduction on an environmentally sustainable basis".
The project would support many positive measures for reforming the legal system and
financial and tax regulations. It would also support capacity-building of the State Department
of Forest Management, and, in the Laboratory Zone, development of improved forest
planning methods, improvement of silvicultural operations, rehabilitation, construction and
maintenance of roads needed for the implementation of the management plans, use of low-
impact cable-logging systems, plus various other useful measures such are: support to
improved forest pest protection, private sector involvement in non-timber forest products,
community forestry.
The "Existing project" addresses the right issues in the forest sector. It would contribute to
significant improvements of the socio-economic and environmental conditions of the forest

sector if the general conditions prevailing in Georgia were favourable for the sustainable and
fair management of renewable resources.
However, the severe economical crisis, the incapacity of State agencies to enforce laws and
the 'quick money" culture to be found at all levels in all sectors will probably continue for
some years. In this context, improving the management of forests is important, but one must
consider that:
objectives must remain modest,
project activities opening opportunities for increased logging might be misused to
unsustainable exploitation what is perceived to be a "mine" of wood.
"No project" scenario
Under the "No project" scenario, the Government of Georgia would not receive the loan from
the World Bank. As a result, it is assumed that none of the project components would be
implemented as planned.
The State Department of Forest Management would continue to exert some control over
forest uses with the limited means in its disposal. The forests would continue to expand area
wise, despite illegal cutting of firewood for local consumption and timber for exportation.
The local economy would benefit very little from the surrounding forests and the existing
infrastructure (roads, buildings, paths) would further deteriorate, making the region less
attractive for tourists.
The "No project" scenario is environmentally inferior to the "Existing project", since illegal
cutting will continue and the "creaming" of high value timber will cause a deterioration of the
genetic stock. Risks of erosion will be greater, because skidding trails could be built without
environmental considerations and maintenance. Damages to standing trees will be more
significant, since trees will be cut in a haphazard way. The "No project" scenario could be
considered as inferior due to the fact that in this case all the instruments for improving the
sustainability of forest management (regional land use plans, forest inventories, forest
management plans, general road plans, detailed road projects, ElAs, etc.) will not be
available.
The "No project" scenario is socially and economically inferior to the "Existing project" since
the potential contributions of the forest sector to the development of the regional economy
would remain minimal in terms of employment, revenues and supply of raw material for the
wood processing industries.
"Integrated forest development" scenario
The "Integrated forest development" scenario would take intersectoral relations into account
and concentrate on activities which provide employment opportunities and do not open the
doors to the misuse of the forest resources. A careful and participative land use planning
would provide the initial development framework.
An "Integrated forest development" as a tentative list of components would include:
1. reduced intensity support to the forest management system, with emphasis on the
adequate tending of protective forests;
2. support to local capacities for the rehabilitation of main roads and energy
infrastructures, since the difficult access to the valleys can be considered as one of
the main obstacles to the valorization of the local wood resources. Electricity
shortage makes local wood processing difficult;

ACTA Consultants                                           Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
3. support to the tourism  sector, with priority on the rehabilitation of existing
infrastructure and marketing in Georgia and abroad, since ecotourism could create
local employment and added value with low negative environmental impact;
4. selected support to livestock breeding, since grazing around villages exerts some
pressure on the forests and breeding concerns a high proportion of the population
in terms of occupation and subsistence.
Such scenario would enable the development of interesting synergies: improvement of the
road and electrical infrastructure can create employments and offer better conditions for the
tourism development; adequate tending of protective forests can produce some wood which
can be processed locally; protection of biodiversity, which would be supported by the
Protected Areas Development Project, can protect this important asset for tourism.
Given the present situation in the Laboratory Zone, such scenario offers better chances for
positive socio-economical and environmental conditions than a sectoral forestry approach.
The implementation of an integrated regional development requires cooperation of different
State agencies. The design and monitoring of the "Integrated land-use and forest
development" support project would require analysis competences and tools, which can be
provided by the World Bank.

Summary of Sectoral Issues and Mitigation Measures - Forestry
Issues                                       Mitigation and additional measures
Laws
1. Improving the forest legislation    1.1   To support the implementation of the 1999 Forest Code of Georgia; a simplification of this Code must be
considered. A streamlined Forest Code should be reduced to the principles, while enforcement issues will
be handled in the regulations.
1.2   Rules, which shall be declared void, should be listed and be declared annulled as soon as possible.
1.3   Missing regulations shall be issued by the responsible authorities. The coherence with other rules shall be
checked. For instance, regulations for long term planning of forest resources shall be created.
2. Contradictions between Laws,   2.1   Laws shall be analyzed and improved in order to clear overlapping competences and contradictions
especially   overlapping   of       between laws. If necessary, the Forest Code shall be improved taking into account all comments and
competences                         conclusions made by relevant governmental structures.
3. Tax   system    and   local   3.1   The Tax and Customs Code shall be changed to encourage development of alternative, environmentally
economic development                safe industries based on the local use of forest resources.
4. Balance between sanctions for   4.1   Incentives shall be created for the law-enforcement agencies to implement sanctions on illegal actions.
illegal cutting and taxes for   4.2   Regarding taxes and fees for commercial logging, the foreseen reform of the forestry financial system must
legal cutting                       pragmatically take in consideration the balance between costs for legal and penalties on illegal logging.

Management of Georgia                and ensuring coordination with other line agencies.
9.1   The Forest Service must be trained on the implementation of updated legislation. It will be the opportunity
to disentangle the net of valid and void regulations. Innovative and participative training methods will be
useful.
10. Improved    capacity    for   10.1  Participative training sessions and excursions on the issue of sustainable forest management shall be
environmental management in           organized. Sharing of experiences with selected countries might be useful.
the forest sector              10.2  Staff at key positions in the State Department of Forest Management shall be trained in matters of EIA. For
most of the staff, detail know-how on all aspects of EIA is probably not necessary.
10.3  Staff of the Department of State Ecological Examination and Environmental Permitting of the MoE and
independent experts reviewing the ElAs must be adequately trained in the assessment of activities
proposed and carried out in the field of forestry.
10.4  A database should be created in order to give experts access to information on methods and techniques
used in European countries.
10.5  The know-how of consulting companies in the field of EIA shall be recognized and improved for use in the
forest sector.
Forest ownership and liability
11. Privatization of forests       11.1  Existence of recent forest privatizations in Georgia shall be verified and documented. It will be important
and interesting to analyze them and to discuss which are the "lessons learnt".
11.2  In a later phase, at most 1 or 2 tests could be implemented in low-conflict areas. Documentation and
transparency in all activities and decisions will be essential. Strict conditions for the realization of the tests
shall be defined, regarding, for instance, protective forests and biodiversity conservation. Liabilities and
penalties in case of legal violations shall be clearly stated before the beginning of forest use.
11.3  The clarification of the regulations defined for the State forests and which will remain valid in privatized
forests must be done. State bodies will have the competence and the duty to control their enforcement. It
will be necessary to underline that, against common understanding in Georgia, private ownership does not
imply that the owner can do anything he wants in his forests. Given this clarification and its implementation,
the environmental situation might not be worse in privatized test plots than it is the case presently.
12. Transfer of rights and liability   12.1  Definition of a legal status for local communities will be necessary.
On forests to local communities    12.2  International experiences in community forestry will be analyzed. Adaptation to Georgian post-soviet and
mountainous conditions is needed.
12.3  1 or 2 tests shall be studied in a well-chosen, "low-conflict" area. An essential condition of success is a

careful support to the internal community organization and to the discussions between local communities
and Forest service. Much time and energy will be gained by taking international experiences in community
forestry into account.
12.4  The information activities foreseen for promoting public awareness in sustainable forest management
should be expanded to include information on the experiments in forest privatization and community
forestry.
Forest Management planning
13. Scope    of   the   forest   13.1  The forest management information system should incorporate information on protected areas and vice-
management plans                    versa, so that data can be exchanged between the Forests Development and the Protected Areas
Development Projects, in order to facilitate coordination of two parallel projects and resolution of conflicts.
In particular, the same Geographical Information System (GIS) should be used by both projects.
14. Land use planning             14.1  The Forests Development Project and the Protected Areas Development Project shall agree on a common
methodology for land use planning, using the same classification criteria for allocating land to defined land
uses, taking into account the principles of multiple use of forests and agriculture and evaluation of the
ecological and economic values of the various ecosystems, using the notion of prevailing function (see
chapter 7, Protective uses). The same guidelines for land use planning should be used for these two
projects.
14.2  The  resulting  land-use  plans should  be submitted  to  an  Environmental Impact Assessment.
Representatives of the local population should be able to express their views at this stage. Remaining
conflicts would have to be resolved by the Central Caucasus Commission.
15. Need  of  EIA  for  forest   15.1  The consistency of management plans with multiple use and sustainable forestry could be evaluated by
management plans                    the Ministry of Environment without carrying out a full EIA. This simplification would be made possible by
adapting the legislation on EIA.
16. Technical  requirements  for   16.1  In addition to temporary sample plots, a sub-sample of permanent plots should be laid out in the whole
updating forest management           Laboratory Zone, as the starting basis for a modern National forest inventory for the whole country. This
plans                                National forest inventory will eventually provide reliable statistical information on the forest resources (such
as changes in the forest cover, volume trends, balance between growth and wood harvests), which are
presently lacking and badly needed for policy decisions at the State and regional levels.
16.2  Permanent sample plots and other monitoring means such as GIS will also be used for periodic monitoring
(on a 5- to 10-years rotation) of environmental changes in the forest (and could be expanded to the
protected areas).

Protective, tourist and cultural use
17. Notion of prevailing function  17.1  The notions of multiple use and of prevailing functions should be incorporated in the Forest Code and in
particular in the Regulations.forAllocating Territories (art. 21 al. 7).
17.2  As an example, the Oni land-use plan should be complemented, incorporating the notions of multiple use
and prevailing functions. Forests should be classified according to their prevailing function. For instance,
the location and extend of protective forests (forests with a prevailing protective function) would be
determined. The resulting "Multifunctional plan' would be of great help for the resolution of land-use
conflicts and would also be used as a planning tool for the forest management plan.
18. Management  of  protective   18.1  The definition of forests with prevailing protective function is to be included in the Forest Code and in
forests                               normative acts.
18.2  Normative acts must be developed to better define and incorporate silvicultural measures and
maintenance activities in protective forests (i.e. forest improvement activities).
18.3  The planning and implementation of protective measures must be incorporated in the Forest Management
Information System (FMIS).
18.4  Training in forest management planning should be extended to training in silviculture of mountain forests,
including the planning of silvicultural measures for protective forests. Such training could rely on
experiences from Europe (Austria, Bavaria, Switzerland).
19. Management of forests with   19.1  Forests with prevailing tourist or cultural functions will have to be determined and incorporated in the
tourist or cultural functions        planning process.
19.2  Tourist and cultural uses in the forests will have to be coordinated with those to be implemented in the
protected areas.
19.3  Maintenance of trails and other tourist and cultural infrastructures is to be financed on cost-sharing basis
with the Protected Areas Development Project.
Forest products including illegal wood cuts
20. Illegal cutting operations     20.1  The monitoring of illegal cutting operations (see chapter 13, Monitoring) must be an integral part of the
Forest Management Information System (FMIS) and have a first priority.
20.2  Penalties (fines) imposed on trespassers should be collected and the revenues should be used for the
restoration of forests damaged by illegal cutting operations should be collected.
20.3  Eradication of large-scale illegal cutting operations is to be made a condition of compliance for the IDA
credit.
21. "Creaming" the forest          21.1  The State must pay correctly to its personnel and give them means to carry out their supervisory duties.

22. Sanitary cuts                  22.1  As for "Creaming": the State must pay correctly to its personnel and give them means to carry out their
supervisory duties.
23. Enhancement of biodiversity   23.1  The provision of wood cutting measures for biodiversity enhancement must be incorporated in the forest
through silvicultural measures        and in the protected areas management plans.
24. Improved economic utilization   24.1  A substantial part of the additional forest revenues should be allocated to the local communities for their
of  forest  resources   and           own use (subject to controls by the central State).
improved  supply  of  forest   24.2  Another portion of the additional revenues shall be dedicated to financing local forest activities as
products  to  the  regional           prescribed in the management plans (tree plantations, cleaning and tending operations, road and trail
economy                               maintenance, etc.).
Infrastructure and wood harvesting systems
25. Need for a general plan and   25.1  Before laying out new roads, a regional road and harvesting system plan must be designed, incorporating
detailed   plans   of  road          results of the land-use and of forest management plans (in addition to other pertinent data, such as
rehabilitation and construction      geotechnical maps, maps of natural hazards and of protected areas). The regional plan will indicate where
activities                            new access roads can be built, where harvesting with skyline systems is feasible and which zones should
be left road less. Preliminary cost estimates will be used for cost/benefit analysis. Investment priorities will
be determined for different forests according to their growth potential, value of forest products and
harvesting costs. The regional plan would be subject to an environmental impact assessment.
25.2  Road stretches that have been included in the regional plan should be laid out in details on a map and on
the ground. A detailed road project will be prepared, including proposals for alternative designs and
layouts. Detail planning will take into account all factors having an incidence on risks of erosion and visual
impact on the landscape (slope of the terrain and road inclination, geotechnical characteristics, problems of
stream crossings, management of surface, water, etc.). Total road costs (construction costs plus
maintenance costs) will be computed. The best proposal would show the lowest cost/benefit ratio and the
smallest risks. According to law, for each road project (renewing, rehabilitation or creation) an EIA shall be
submitted to the Ministry of Environment.
25.3  Construction standards will be adapted to the severe weather conditions of the Central Caucasus, in order
to minimize future maintenance costs and risks of damages to roads and the environment.
26. Need for environment-friendly   26.1  In zones with too steep slopes or/and instable geological conditions no roads shall be built.
equipment and  construction   26.2  The use of explosives shall be restricted. Conditions such as specialized staff with permits to use explosive
methods                              will be defined. Training on the adequate explosive quantities will be useful.
26.3  The management of cut material should be planned and optimized at the detailed planning phase of a
road. During detailed planning, several alternative road locations should be studied, to look for the best
adaptation to the relief and to geology.

direction, distance between cable lines, location of landings, etc.). They should be coordinated with
wood marking and subsequent log transportation.
*  Skidding operations should be stopped under adverse atmospheric conditions, to avoid soil
compaction and water logging. Deep skidding spurs must be leveled out.

National Forests Development Project
FOREWORD
The Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SEA) offers an opportunity for sector-wide
environmental analysis before investment priorities are determined. It avoids the inherent
limitations of project-specific Environmental Assessments (EA) in addressing issues related
to policy and planning and the legal and institutional framework.
By moving upstream in the planning process to a stage where major strategic decisions have
not yet been made, SEA offers better opportunities not only for analyzing existing policies,
institutions, and development plans in terms of environmental issues, but also for supporting
environmentally sound sector wide investment strategies.
Sectoral environmental assessment (SEA) is an important part in development planning.
SEA offers an opportunity for sector-wide environmental analysis before investment priorities
have been determined. It also supports integration of environmental concerns into long-term
development and investment planning. SEA is applied in the FDP since sector investment
program involves multiple components and sub-projects.
This SEA is made according to World Bank guidance on sectoral EA - Operational Directive
(OD) 4.00, Annex A: Environmental Assessment (amended in 1991 as OD 4.01), the
Environmental Assessment Sourcebook Update, which belongs to Chapter 1: The
Environmental Review Process.
Sectoral EA is a good planning tool for investment to:
* prevent serious environmental impacts through analysis of sector policies and
investment strategies upstream in the planning process, before major decisions are
made.
* assist governments in forming a long-term view of the sector and increase the
transparency of the sectoral planning process, thereby decreasing the opportunities
for purely political decisions that might be environmentally harmful.
* analyze institutional, legal and regulatory aspects related to the sector, and for
making comprehensive and realistic recommendations regarding, for example,
environmental standards, guidelines, law enforcement, and training, thus reducing the
need for similar analysis in downstream EA work.
. provide opportunities for consideration of alternative policies, plans, strategies or
project types, taking into account their costs and benefits.
* help to alter or eliminate environmentally unsound investment alternatives at an early
stage, thus reducing overall negative environmental impacts, while also eliminating
the need for project-specific EA of these alternatives.
* consider cumulative impacts of multiple ongoing and planned investments within a
sector, as well as impacts from existing policies and policy changes.
* collect and organize environmental data into information and, in the process, identify
data gaps and needs at an early stage, and to outline methods, schedules and
responsibilities for data collection and management during program or project
implementation.
* allow for comprehensive planning of general sector-wide mitigation, management,
and monitoring measures, and for identifying broad institutional, resource and
technological needs at an early stage.

provide a basis for collaboration and coordination across sectors, and help to avoid
duplication of efforts and policy contradictions between sector agencies and
ministries.
*  strengthen preparation and implementation of sub-projects by recommending criteria
for environmental analysis and review, and standards and guidelines for project
implementation.
The SEA is preceding, in the development of the project, the Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA), which is an instrument to identify and assess the potential environmental
impacts of a proposed project, evaluate alternatives, and design appropriate mitigation,
management, and monitoring measures.
Due to its position in the Project Processing evolution, some inconsistencies with names,
titles and figures could appear in the documents edited during the process.
In the different reference documents used as basis for the present SEA, the title of the
project appears in different versions. At present, the correct one is Forests Development
Project.
During the carrying out of the study, the Project Preparation Unit (PPU) took the name of
Forest Sector Development Center. Both names could appear in the text.
In the same way, the Project Description itself evaluated during the SEA process; the present
report is trying to include the last version.
The Terms of Reference (ToR) of the present SEA have also been adapted, since its first
publication and the beginning of the study. Considerable limitations (such as limitation to a
defined Laboratory Zone, covering four districts in the Central Caucasus) have been placed,
taking into account the Project conditions.
The English final report is the reference version, if some discrepancy occurs in the
translation.

National Forests Development Project
I    Introduction
1.1  Background
The Government of Georgia (GoG) has requested that the World Bank (the Bank) provide
support for a Forests Development Project. This Project will help the GoG to establish sound
forest management systems that would maximize the contribution of Georgia's forests to
economic development and rural poverty reduction on an environmentally sustainable basis.
The Project is of critical importance to Georgia's forests and people. With the enactment of
the new Forest Code of Georgia in June 1999, Georgia has adopted a legal framework and
roadmap for transition to market principles of forest economy, including its possible
privatization, while safeguarding the critical environmental, social and cultural functions of the
nation's forests. Identified as P044800, the Project that will be implemented in 2002-2007 is
designed to provide critical support to this ambitious transition. The total project cost estimate
is about US$27 million dollars equivalent and is proposed to be financed in 2002-2007 by an
IDA credit of US$20 million. It is closely linked and coordinated with the Protected Areas
Development Project (GEF grant of US$8.7 million).
The project has been placed in the Bank environmental screening category "B." However,
the GoG, as part of the ongoing preparation activities, decided to undertake a Sectoral
Environmental Assessment (SEA) 4, which will be consistent with the Georgian environmental
legislation, and the requirements of the Bank's environmental screening category "A,"
outlined in Operational Policy 4.01 "Environmental Assessment". As a significant focus of
Project implementation is to promote policy development, it is expected analyses on the
sectoral environmental impact will continue as policies and forests-related programs evolve.
1.2  Project Objectives and Components
The Project is expected to be implemented over a period of 6 years and will include the
following five components:
Components                                             Estimated    % of              IDA         of which PPF

Depending on the project, a range of instruments can be used to satsfy the Bank's EA requirement: environmental impact assessment (EIA),
regional or sectoral EA, environmental audit, hazard or nsk assessment, and environmental management plan (EMP). When the project is likely
to have sectoral or regional impacts, sectorai or regional EA is required. A Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SEA) Is an instrument, which
offers opportunibes for sector-wide environmental analysis and support integration of environmental concerns into long-term development and
investment planning. SEAs are particularly suited for reviewing (a) the effect of sectoral policy changes; (b) sector investment altematves; (c)
institutional capacity and requirements for environmental review, implementation and monitoring at the sectoral level; and (d) cumulative impacts
of many relatively small, similar investments which by themselves may not appear to have significant environmental impact. World Bank guidance
on sectoral EA can be found in OP 4.01, the Environmental Assessment Sourcebook (1991) and the October 1993 Environmental Assessment
Sourcebook Update (Number 4).

ACTA Consultants                                         Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
Project Description
Component A "Support to National Forest Policy Formulation and Implementation"
(US$ 6.8 million)
Under this component, investments would be made in improving the capacity of the
Government of Georgia (GoG) for forest sector analysis, planning and policy formulation,
completing the legislation for implementation of the new Forest Code, designing and carrying
out appropriate institutional, governance and financial reform in the sector, training of public
officials, and raising public awareness in the objectives of the national forest policy.
In particular, this component would support the State Department of Forest Management
(SDFM) and other relevant agencies in:
(i)   finalization  and  public discussion  of new  forest regulations supporting
implementation of the Forest Code, including harmonization with existing laws;
this would include regulations for the transfer of kolkhoz (collective farms) forests
to communities and development of guidelines for privatization of certain forest
lands;
(ii)   development and implementation of a forestry institutional reorganization plan;
(iii)   development and implementation of a forestry financial system  reform plan;
including:
* revision of the method of financing the State Department of Forest
Management to guarantee for it a sustainable source of revenue to carry out
forest management and protection functions;
* revision of stumpage regulations in order to differentiate by quality and
provide incentives for resource conservation; and
* implementation of administrative regulations in order to allow for better
tracking of timber production and exports.
(iv)   preparation and public discussion of the National Forest Policy and Strategy and
the draft law "On Privatization of State Forests in Georgia".
A cohesive system of implementing regulations would form initial basis for further forest
governance reforms and forest policy formulation. Given this priority, development and
discussion of regulations is already carried out under the PPF financing, while the
privatization law and national policy would be finalized at the later stages of the project. The
development of the financial system reform plan is also already being financed though the
PPF; it would be based on the overall assessment of the national forest resources,
evaluation of the governance, transparency and capacity of the private sector in forestry,
evaluation of the market prospects for wood and non-wood products, and analysis of all
public revenues from forestry, including the setting of stumpage values and the organization
of auction systems.
The component would then support implementation of this plan, specifically by setting up a
Forest Management Information System (FMIS) and training the SDFM and core ministries'
staff in operating it. The development of an institutional reorganization plan (also financed
under the PPF) would lay ground for strengthening normative and regulatory functions of the
SDFM, rationalizing central and field capacity for its forest management planning and
oversight responsibilities and proper coordination with other line agencies, private sector,
communities, and civil society. In addition to restructuring the central office, the existing 54
district offices would be replaced with two regional offices and 36 range offices.

ACTA Consultants                                        Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
The component would then provide all the necessary technical assistance, training and
incremental  logistical   means   (mainly  building   rehabilitation,  transportation,
equipment/materials) to implement this plan. Overall, the most critical elements of this
component (development of implementing regulations and reform planning) are financed up-
front through the PPF phase (which activities were financed in 2000-2001 by the PPF credit
advance of US$ 0.99 million).
Component B "Support to Efficient and Participatory Forest Management Planning"
(US$ 3.3 million)
Under this component, investments would be made in improving the quality of forest
assessment and inventory carried out by the SDFM, introduction of integrated forest
conservation and utilization planning techniques on a landscape-ecological basis, enabling
transparent access to forest management planning process and facilitating public
participation in it.
In particular, this component would support:
(i)    a total economic valuation of Georgian forests;
(ii)   preparation of an improved forest inventory for a model forest area of the Central
Caucasus Planning Area ("laboratory zone" - four districts over around 460,000
ha); in the Central Caucasus; through:
* development of a methodology for ecosystems-based landscape planning and
forest inventory using sustainable forest management principles;
v support to a landscape planning, ecosystem-based inventory;
* detailed forest inventory and management plan in the areas selected for
sustainable forest utilization; and
* development of a forest management information system.
(iii)  preparation of model land-use and forest management plans for the above areas;
and
(iv)   promotion of public awareness in sustainable forest management through
participatory management planning for community and local forests.
These activities would be implemented jointly and in coordination with the planning
component of the GEF-financed Protected Areas Development Project. The underlying
landscape-ecological planning techniques have already been developed using Japanese
grant funding under the preparation phase and the field-testing, and an initial inventory of
70,000 ha (together with provision of equipment and aerial photography) is being carried out
with PPF financing. The component would then support provision of additional equipment,
surveys and training to replicate improved inventory and planning on a significant scale
outside of the laboratory zone, and additional facilities and equipment for information
dissemination.
Component C "Support to Effective Forest Protection and Afforestation" (US$ 9.5
million)
Under this component, investments would be made in forest protection and afforestation of
the most critically degraded forest areas near population centers through improvements in
technical capacity of local forest management units and development of public works in
community-based forestry.

In particular, this component would support:
(i)   improved seed production/processing and nursery development;
(ii)   carrying out an afforestation program over about 3,100 ha; and
(iii)  carrying out a forest restoration program over about 5,600 ha in the priority zone
around Tbilisi.
Seed processing and testing operations will be brought together under one existing Seed
Center that will be upgraded.   An existing nursery in the priority zone will be
expanded/upgraded and used for supplying quality seedlings for afforestation and forest
restoration, and as a model for replication in other districts. The afforestation and restoration
programs will take place in the priority zone using a combination of community-managed
public works and, where appropriate, private contractors using more cost-efficient
techniques.
These actions will result in the SDFM having significantly increased its capacity for collecting,
processing and testing quality seeds and producing quality seedlings. They would also
facilitate a phased development of community-managed forestry in Georgia (to be supported
by parallel donor financing). Moreover, around 40% of the erosion-prone areas in the priority
zone will be afforested and 10% of the degraded areas restored.
Component D "Promotion of Private Sector Participation in Sustainable Forest
Management" (US$ 6.0 million)
Under this component, investments would be made in development, demonstration,
certification and promotion of sustainable forest harvesting and transportation standards and
techniques, so as to facilitate the emergence of private sector operators in forestry, as well
as in the development of non-wood forest products, hunting and ecotourism on an
environmentally sustainable basis.
This component would significantly draw on the technical assistance provided under
Component A towards development of the draft law "On Privatization of State Forests in
Georgia" where the parts of the national legal and fiscal systems dealing with the possible
operations of private businesses in forestry will be revised, simplified and made more
stimulating for entrepreneurs. In particular, this component would support setting up a
privately run Business Support Association.
The Association would be set up on a full cost-recovery basis and would provide demand-
driven support services to interested entrepreneurs (e.g. training in book keeping and
management, market intelligence, certification of products and systems and transfer of
improved technologies). The Association would be initially operated under contract by the
private sector that would eventually be expected to take it over and convert it into a private
entity. Furthermore, upon completion of the improved forest management plan in a suitable
area of the Central Caucasus Laboratory Zone, the component would support there a
privately-run demonstration program of improved, low-impact harvesting and transportation
systems and a forest road rehabilitation/construction public program.
The program should result in a growing use by private entrepreneurs of independently
certified techniques, processes and equipment that are more cost-efficient and environment-
friendly. Moreover, the forest road network inside the laboratory zone will be significantly
improved through the operation of the road construction unit included as part of the
demonstration program introducing improved transportation systems. In addition, the road
rehabilitation/construction works under the public program - contracted out to private
entrepreneurs - will cover about 225 km outside of the Laboratory Zone. Lastly, the

component would support preparation of a strategy for promoting non-wood forest products
and carrying out pilot investments in 2 or 3 selected sites. The component's support should
result in increased sales and exports of wood and non-wood products from the private sector
and in a greater involvement of the entrepreneurs in the carrying out of forestry operations.
Component E "Project Management" (US$ 1.4 million)
This component would support overall project administration and provide to the SDFM staff
hands-on training and technology transfer in project development and implementation,
application of fiduciary and anti-corruption safeguards. A number of critical capacity building
steps, including setting up the project management unit, training in implementation and
procurement planning, monitoring and evaluation, financial management systems, etc. - is
being financed up-front under the PPF phase (see Table 1.2.1).
Implementation Arrangements
The preparation and implementation of the Project is administered by the Georgia Forest
Sector Development Center (FSDC) - a legal body of civil law established by the decree of
the President of Georgia on October 29, 2000. FSDC operates under the overall guidance of
a Supervisory Board appointed by the President of Georgia. The Supervisory Board is
chaired by a member of the Parliament of Georgia and comprised of officials of the key
interested ministries and presidential administration, with participation of the academic and
NGO community. (To ensure proper coordination between this project and the GEF-funded
Protected Areas Development Project, a significant overlap is ensured in the membership of
their respective Supervisory Boards.) FSDC is headed by the Project Director selected in an
open tender by a selection commission and approved by the President of Georgia. FSDC
reports to the Ministry of Finance of Georgia on financial matters and to the Georgian State
Department of Forest Management on technical matters.

National Forests Development Project
Table 1.2.1. Summary of PPF-funded Project Activities
The Government of Georgia has already borrowed US$0.99 million of IDA funds through a
PPF credit advance to implement in 2000-2001 the following subset of front-loaded project
activities:
(1)   Development of improved forest policies and regulations, including
(i)   finalization and public discussion of new  forest regulations supporting
implementation of the 1999 Forest Code of Georgia;
(ii)   development of a forestry institutional reorganization plan; and
(iii)  development of a forestry financial system reform plan;
(2)   Development of improved forest management planning  and  protection
techniques, including
(i)   total economic valuation of Georgian forests;
(ii)   methodology of improved forest inventory on a landscape-ecological basis in
a model forest area in the Central Caucasus;
(iii)  participatory management planning for community forests; and
(iv)   promotion of public awareness in sustainable forest management;
(3)   Project implementation capacity building, including
(i)   setting up a project management unit;
(ii)   preparation of detailed project implementation, procurement and monitoring
and evaluation plans, financial management systems, including project
advisory and audit services; and
(iii)  training of project management unit staff.
1.3  Project steps
Substantial technical work detailing each component was completed in 1998-99 by the
SDFM together with the FAO specialists. Additional preparation work (including Overall
Forest Utilization Planning, Social Assessment, and this Sectoral EA study) is being financed
by a Japanese project preparation grant and has to be completed before project appraisal.
The remaining critical preparation and start-up activities for the Project including: (i)
development of improved forest policies and regulations; (ii) development of improved forest
management planning and protection techniques; and (iii) project implementation capacity
building - are being funded through a project preparation advance (PPF) in September 2000
to July 2001.
Project implementation is being carried out in the following way. The Forestry Development
Fund (FDF) - a project preparation unit established under the SFD that is currently
administering the Japanese Grant, was used as the core of the new Project Management
Unit (PMU) that has been established in March 2001 by a decree of the President of
Georgia. Administration of the remainder of the Japanese grant will also be transferred to
this new entity. The PMU was established as a legal person under Georgia's civil law and its
Executive Director was nominated by the Ministry of Finance and SFD and appointed by the
President. The PMU will report to a twelve-member Supervisory Board that will include

representatives of the Ministries of Economy, Finance, Agriculture, and Environment, SDFM,
State Department of Protected Areas, Nature Reserves and Hunting Farms (SDPA), State
Department of Land Management, Parliamentary Committee on Environmental Protection
and Natural Resources, Georgian Academy of Sciences, and non-govemmental
organizations.
The first stage of the Project will focus on implementing land-use and forest management
planning activities agreed to by all interested stakeholders during project preparation and
early stages of implementation. After sufficient dialogue and analyses, later stages of
implementation will focus more directly on forest sector investments, with an increasingly
important role played by the private sector.  Work on land-use planning and forest
management information systems will, however, continue for the duration of the Project and
beyond.
An environmental management plan (EMP) for project implementation is developed as part
of this study.  This EMP provides a process by which specific environmental impact
assessments will be conducted for each of the Project's subcomponents before the Bank
financing. Guidelines for sustainable forest management in a format that can act as a
sourcebook for forest managers and which are consistent with the FAO Model Code of
Forest Harvesting Practice will also be developed during project implementation. These will
include not only guidelines for environmentally friendly silvicultural and harvesting operations,
but also guidelines for the EIA of forestry practices on forest biodiversity, ecosystems-based
inventories, but also for the establishment of forest lands Landscape Ecological Networks.
These will culminate in the preparation of sustainable forest management 10-year plan
guidelines.
The Implementing Agency for the Project is the Georgian State Department of Forest
Management. Financing for Project preparation commenced in July 1998. Significant
analysis (including legal analysis) and proposals for Project financing were developed in
partnership with FAO. A Social Assessment was carried out in August-December 1999 and
its results were published in July 2000.
The main objective of the NFDP is to help Georgia maximize - on a sustainable basis - the
environmental and economic benefits from its forests. The critical assumption for the
achievement of the program's objective is that the Government, in particular the Parliament,
supports the implementation of the NFDP as well as of the GEF-funded Protected Areas
Development Project. This latter project - now being formulated by the WB - is expected to
be implemented in parallel with the NFDP and to complement its activities, especially in the
program's Laboratory Zone composed of four districts (Ambrolauri, Lentekhi, Oni and
Tsageri) located in the Central Caucasus Mountains (see Figures 1 and 2).
Furthermore, it is also assumed that all the other stakeholders, particularly at the district/field
levels, actively support the program. In addition to the SDFM in charge of implementing the
NFDP, the other stakeholders consist mainly of the MoE, the MFRI, the SDPA, the State
Agrarian University and various NGOs possibly involved in the program's various
components.
Laboratory Zone (Ambrolauri, Lentekhi, Oni and Tsageri regions), selected as priority zone
for the Project, is located in the Central Caucasus region and spreads over an area of
460,000 ha with a population of 56,000 habitants (see Figure 1 and 2). A 1996 forest
inventory listed some 35 existing tree/bush species and beech dominated over more than
50% of the total area. A large part of the zone's forests are located in very remote areas and
on difficult terrain5.

The project in Laboratory Zone will focus on development and improvement of forest
planning and management systems including forest inventory, landscape-ecological zoning
and environmental and social assessments for forest conservation and multiple-purpose use.
1.4 Objective of the SEA
The objectives of the SEA are to:
(i) analyze the policy, legal and administrative framework relevant to the forest
sector and make recommendations for reform if needed;
(ii) identify major environmental and social issues related to the development of the
forest sector;
(iii) collect baseline data in relation to these environmental and social issues and their
trends;
(iv) analyze potential impacts from proposed Project activities, particularly for long-
term sustainable development, and make recommendations for mitigation if
necessary;
(v) analyze in-country capacity for environmental management and assessment in
the sector;
(vi) provide general guidelines for long-term sector-wide environmental monitoring;
and
(vii) assist in inter-agency coordination and public/NGO consultation process.
1.5 Methodology of GIS and Remote Sensing
The necessity of applying the Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing
(RS) for Forests development Project is conditioned by the following factors:
* Existence of large databases of forest resources, which needs permanent update;
. Existence of different types of information, which needs integrated study and
information synthesis;
* Authenticity of information;
* Spatial Analysis of data;
* Dynamic study of processes;
* Modeling & prognosis;
* Establishment and maintenance of the monitoring system.
Database and Forest Information. Key issues for the development of proper forestry
strategy are creation of comprehensive database, its management and analysis. Forestry
Geo-lnformation System should comprise data on forest, ecosystem and other related
information. Forest information includes: types of forest resources and information on
standing volume. Ecosystem information comprises electronic layers on each component
of forest ecosystem together with all kind of information linked.
Furthermore, other information on forestry GIS includes electronic layers on phenomenon
and processes (natural, socio-economic, historic-cultural, etc.), which take place on study
area and influence sustainable development of entire territory system.

National Forests Development Project
Alphanumerical databases are linked with the graphic representations, which allowed us
to compile thematic matrices, build graphs, diagrams and make statistical analysis during
the working period.
Permanently updated Geo-lnformation System is an excellent tool for spatial and
dynamic analysis of various phenomenon and processes.
* Modeling. Relief of the territory plays one of the determining factors of diversity of forest
cenosis. Altitude of the territory, inclination of slopes and exposition are one of the main
influencing factors on development of the most complicated natural complexes.
Considering this fact, our team developed 3D mathematical model of surface for Oni area
(see figure 5) and its adjacent territories (Pilot Zone) in 1:50,000 scale on the basis of
topographical map. New aerial photos (2000) were stretched on 3D model, which gave
opportunity to visualize virtually above-mentioned territory (see figure 7).
Modeling of relief on the pilot zone was done, which gave possibility to calculate
inclination of slopes, exposition and altitude of the territory. The hydrological model could
be made based on long-term observation data of hydro-meteorological centers and a
number of other parameters. Experts team tried to obtain necessary information,
however, unfortunately, these data are not available in Georgia. Furthermore, creation of
hydrological model must be based on results of lab analysis.
* Authenticity of information. Aerial photos of 2000 (see Figure 3) give possibility to
obtain reliable data about existing situation and to compare and correlate them to those
of 1989 (see Figure 4). New (2000) and old aerial photos (1989) were projected and
linked to the coordinates. On the basis of color classification of aerial photos, team
experts distinguished 4 categories: forests, clear areas, waters and settlements.
According to this classification, comparative analysis of new and old aerial photos has
been implemented.
Unfortunately, the part of aerial photos was covered with dark shadows, effect of
reflection was rather high and it was impossible to make spectral analysis considering
conditions of very complicated relief. In order to reach desirable results in spectral
analysis, it is recommended to purchase multispectral satellite images. Proposed
software for processing of satellite images is ERDAS Imagine.
* Monitoring. Developed forestry needs effective, long-term monitoring. GIS and Remote
Sensing give possibility to identify sensitive areas (hot spots) needing special attention
and monitoring. Hot spots needing intensive monitoring could be: territories with high
biodiversity value, geo-dynamic processes, forest diseases, etc.
Methodology
The software used by experts' team during the work was the Arc View GIS 3.2 (ESRI) and
Image Analysis - (united product of ESRI' and ERDAS).
As a background, topographical maps (1:50,000) were applied.
The following GIS are prepared:
*   baseline information, (see Figures 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13)
ESRI and ERDAS are registered trade marks

*   prevalent soils, (see Figure 8)
*   fauna, (see Figures 11, 12, 13)
*   socioeconomic information,
*   cultural and natural heritage. (see Figure 15)
Through the application of the special GIS module, team identified concrete territories, which
according to the legislation and normative acts, fells under the cutting prohibition status:
For Oni area and its adjacent territories, 3D mathematical model of surface was built
(1:50,000), which allows: to derive aspects, distinguish slopes under 300, between 300-350
and above 350 and make hydrologic modeling of the given territory (see Figure 5).
Through the application of another GIS module, the following territories in the pilot zone were
identified:
*   natural habitats of sub-alpine zone with the width of 300 m;
*   forest line located within 200 m from permanent snow beds;
-   potential avalanches and floods;
*   protective forest areas located within 300 m from the river banks;
e   lakes;
*   water reservoirs;
*   protective forest lines located within 100 m from steep slopes (above 400 m);
*   karst objects,
*   forest areas located within 1 km radius of the mineral springs.
* Prognosis. Result of any kind of modeling and analysis is the prognosis, which helps
decision-making bodies to make the right decision.
1.6  Description of Georgia
Georgia is located between the southern side of the Great Caucasus and the northern side of
the Lesser Caucasus, between 43°35' and 41°03' latitude, and between 41°00' and 46043'
longitude. (See Figure 1)
Relief
Covering a territory of 69'700 km2 Georgia is a typical mountainous country. About 54% of
the territory are mountains, 33% - foothills and mounds, and only 13% are occupied by
plains. The average altitude of the country's territory is 1,230 m above sea level. Almost one-
fifth of the territory is occupied by high-mountains, where only several villages are located.

Due to its position, the absolute altitude changes from 0 m (sea level) up to 5,201 m (Mt.
Shkhara)
High-vertical zones are strongly pronounced in the mountain territories and are related to the
change of natural conditions with altitude. The following vertical divisions exist in Georgia:
- High-mountain relief - begins from the upper border of forest, 2,000-2,500 m above
sea level. The existence of strong segmentation, steep slopes, cliffs and old frozen
forms are characteristic for this region.
- Middle-mountain relief - the altitude of location fluctuates 800-2,200 m in the East.
- Low-mountain relief - begins from 1,000 m.
- Plateaus - according to altitude they are divided into low and high plateaus.
- Inter-mountain hollow.
-  Hilly relief - average altitude is 100-200 m. In westem Georgia hilly relief mainly is
found up to 200-500 m, but in eastern Georgia it is found between a broad of range of
the altitudes (400-1,000 m).
- Law places - are located below 200 m (Kolkheti wetland, Alazani plain).
The territory of Georgia comprises volcanic, glacial, paleoglacial, erosion, erosion-
denundation, arid-denundation, karstic, alluvial, and prolluvial types of relief.
The morphology of the country results in shortage of arable land, about 20% of territory is
located higher than 2,000 m, and therefore, agriculture is rather impossible there. Another
34% of the territory is occupied by lands, altitude of which is 1,000-2,000 m. The majority of
this territory is presented by steep and middle slopes (more than 15-200). The agricultural
lands occupy only 7,400 km2.
Climate
The country, being protected from cold air by the Caucasus mountain receives warm and
moist air from the Black Sea.
Due to its position, the West Georgia has a humid subtropical climate, the South Georgia -
continental climate and the climate of the East Georgia varies between moderate humid to
dry subtropical.
Forest
According to the data of 1988 Forest Fund inventory, some 40% of Georgia's total territory is
actually covered with forests, which means approximately 2.75 million ha. About 2.2 million
ha are classified as State Forests under the responsibility of the SDFM and the remaining
consists of former 'Kolkhoz lands" part of which are now in the process of being transferred
to the SDFM. The State Forests are composed of 80% of broadleaves and 20% of conifers.
The main species are: beech covering 49% of the lands, oak - 10%, fir - 8%, hornbeam - 7%,
spruce - 6%, pine - 5%, alder - 3% and chestnut - 3%. In terms of age structure, 48% of the
State Forests (area-wise) are medium-aged, 15% - maturing and 30% mature and over
mature (7% are considered as young).

National Forests Development Project
2   Baseline Information
2.1  Social Assessment
Introduction and general approach
The Government of Georgia (GoG) has identified sustainable forest management systems as
one of top priority issues, which would maximize the contribution to country's economical
development and rural poverty reduction on the environmental sound basis. In 1997, after
study of the field and various consultations with different stakeholders, the Government
prepared National Forest Strategy. In June 1999, the Parliament adopted "The Forest Code",
which establishes a legal framework for utilization, protection, restoration and maintenance of
forest resources.
To improve forest management in Georgia, the GoG requested the World Bank to assist in
preparation and financing of a Georgia Forests Development Project (FDP). FDP has been
prepared with the assistance of the World Bank (WB) and the Investment Center of the Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO Investment Center). Georgian authorities - the State
Department of Forest Management (SDFM), Ministry of Environment (MoE) and other
governmental and non-governmental organizations, who took part in this preparation of the
Project. FDP is a five-year investment program. Its main purpose is to maximize economic
benefits from the forest and at the same time protect its rich ecosystem.
As it was mentioned above, SEA is an important part in development planning since it offers
an opportunity for sector-wide environmental analysis before investment priorities have been
determined. SEA is applied in the FDP since sector investment program involves multiple
components and sub-projects.
According to the World Bank guidance public consultation is an integral part of the sectoral
EA (see OD 4.01 and EA Sourcebook Update No. 5: Public Involvement in Environmental
Assessment for more specific guidance). However, since the SEA covers an entire forest
sector in a national context and is conducted before concrete investment decisions are
made, at this level, it was not possible to consult representatives of all potentially concerned
people during preparation of this SEA. Obviously, successful consultation process will help
ensure public support for the final forest sector program. Therefore, in the beginning of the
study potential stakeholders were identified and consultations were held. Consultations were
held with national NGOs (for nature protection), scientific experts, relevant government
agencies, and also industrial and commercial interests.
According to the World Bank's Operational Directive on Environmental Assessment (OD
4.01), once the project will be ready for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), affected
groups and NGOs must be consulted as part of the environmental assessment process, and
the draft EIA must be disclosed to the public for review and comment prior to finalizing the
report. In order to ensure that this will be carried out in a systematic way and that that the
views and interests of all project stakeholders will be taken into account, a Public
Consultation and Disclosure Plan (PCDP)6 should be prepared for the EIA of project. The
objective of the PCDP will be to ensure that all stakeholders and interested parties will be
fully informed of the environmental assessment process and that they will have the
opportunity to voice their concerns and opinions on environmental issues and management
during the EIA preparation process.
The social study implemented in the framework of SEA identifies major potential social
impacts related with the Project implementation and development of the forest sector,

reviews and highlights social assessment completed by GORBI, underlines issues identified
by stakeholders and proposes management and mitigation plans.
The social study has been carried out at two levels:
*  At national level: interested government bodies (SDFM, MoE, SDPA, State Department
of Land Management, State Department of Geology, etc.), NGOs and other interested
members of the society have been interviewed and consulted during the study.
*  At the local level: government authorities, potentially affected nearby villagers, wood
processing enterprises, forest users (private companies), NGOs and other interested
stakeholders in Oni and Ambrolauri districts were interviewed.
Consultation methodology
Initially, consultation during the SEA preparation process helped to identify key forest related
and environmental issues on national and local levels and provide information on
stakeholders' major concerns.
The following key stakeholders were identified at the national and local levels:

Any other stakeholders identified through the consultation process
The team of experts conducted group meeting, carried out individual and group
consultations, and conducted interviews in Tbilisi, in Oni and Ambrolauri. During
interview/consultation phase, combination of semi-structured interviews, in-situ observation
and focus groups were used. The aim of these meetings was to obtain essential objective
information about educational level, main jobs, economical situation, out-migration, etc. in the
view of forest management and utilization.
In semi-structured interviews took part the individuals whose activities are related with
forests: SDFM's representatives, environmentalists, scientists, foresters, NGOs, etc. The
main purpose of the questions used in semi-structured interviews was to receive information
about the existing forest management practices.
Main Concerns:
The opinion about the forest condition is changing depending in which region a person lives.
Suggested alternative management "model" must be implemented in the already selected
Laboratory Zone.
Socioeconomic conditions of local populations in the selected Laboratory Zone in the Central
Caucasus region, which comprises Racha (Oni and Ambrolauri), Svaneti (Lentekhi) and
Lechkumi (Tsageri) districts are rather complicated. Certainly, these circumstances must be
taken into consideration while preparation of the "model" forest management or inventory
plans and implementation of the Forests Development Project. For this purpose, the
Georgian Opinion Research Business International (GORBI) was commissioned to
implement Social Assessment (SA) of the Laboratory Zone of the project in 1999-2000.
Poverty:
It must be noted that according to the GORBI report, a new social class living below the
poverty limit (consisting mainly of the unemployed, pensioners, invalids, part of the
intelligentsia and people employed with State organizations) emerged in Oni, Ambrolauri,
Tsageri and Lentekhi districts. The earthquake aggravated the socioeconomic condition in
1991, causing serious damages to the Ambrolauri and Oni districts.
According to income level, three major groups can be identified within the local population.
Almost all residents of these districts cut wood; woodcutting increases as income decreases.
Three major groups of local population according to the income level are7:
%                Description                                 Identification
25%              can not buy neither food nor clothes        the poorest group
25%              can buy food, but not always clothes        middle poor
50%              can buy both of them                        the least poor

Living standard according to the regions can be given as follows:
Living standard         Oni         Lentekhi     Ambrolauri      Tsageri
The poorest             50%          45,3%          23.3%         0.7%
Middle poor             32%           42%           70.7%         46.6%
The least poor          18%           12.7%          6%           52.7%
According to the main purposes of woodcutting, the local population can be divided into two
groups:
* Those who cut wood to use it for heating, cooking and construction purposes;
* Those who cut wood to sell it.
The poorest householders more likely live in Oni and Lentekhi. The main problems in the
regions are unemployment, low income and poor transportation. They depend on the forest
recourses greatly and they are less informed about the forest issues.
The middle poor more likely reside in Ambrolauri. They are more informed about forest
related issues and are not content with forest conditions.
The least poor residents are fewer dependants on the forest. They use alternative fuel for
heating and cooking. As for other groups, their problems are low income and unemployment,
but they also inadequate electricity and healthcare problems.
The change of the social system and regaining of sovereignty necessitated a fundamental
reorganization of the health system. Unless the serious problems of funding for the health
system are addressed, existing critical situation will not be completely overcome. The State
funding for the health system in the project region is rather low. Namely, according to the
1998 data, the State funding for the health system came to 3 GEL (1 GEL = 0.5 US$) per
capita in the district of Lentekhi, 2 GEL in Ambrolauri, 1.2 GEL in Oni and 1 GEL in Tsageri.
Due to the funding problems, the number of in-patients has decreased. Namely, the number
of places for in-patients in hospitals of the district of Ambrolauri amounted to 90 per 90,000
residents in1989, but it dropped to 38 in 1998.8
Unemployment
At present, unemployment and low personal incomes are the most urgent issues the local
population in the laboratory zone is facing. In this respect, socially vulnerable people
(pensioners, invalids, etc.) and people employed with the state institutions are particularly in
critical position. Comparing remuneration figures of the 1998 with those of 1989, shows clear
downward trend in personal incomes: the average monthly salary paid to employees
engaged in industry in 1998 accounted for 20% of the corresponding figure in 1989 in the
Lentekhi district, 27% in Ambrolauri, 29% in Oni and 59% in Tsageri. This causes difficulties
in purchasing alternative fuel, health problems, insufficient food, poor farming equipment and
out-migration. It should be noted that because of few employment opportunities in their own
districts, the significant and most active part of the population, especially the youth, seeks
work in economically better-developed regions and cities. Almost one member of the family
(about 45%) left the family.

There has been an upward trend in retail in the project districts in the latest years. According
to the 1998 data, there were 52 retail businesses in Lentekhi, 156 - in Ambrolauri, 43 - in Oni
and 142 - in Tsageri. The inner structure of the trade sector is analogous virtually in every
district. Namely, agricultural products, as well as oil products and cigarettes make up the
major portion of the total volume of trading.
It must be noted that present trade figures can be hardly compared with those of 1989.
Namely, according to the 1998 data, the volume of retail accounted for 7% of the analogous
volume of 1989 in the Lentekhi district, 8% in Tsageri. The districts of Ambrolauri and
especially Oni are exceptions, where the volume of retail is quite high, accounting for 35%
and 56%. This can be explained by the fact that the Ambrolauri district serves as a regional
center, when the Oni district still serves seasonally for domestic tourism.
Existence of unique medicinal mineral waters, recreational resources, as well as certain
infrastructure and traditions for tourism development, can stimulate development of trade and
service sectors, which will create job opportunities and increase personal incomes.9.
It should be mentioned that 57% of respondents are willing to start their own business, they
are interested in forest related activities, bee-keeping and forest nurseries; others are
interested in tourism; some are interested in weaving, mineral water, wine, silk, fruit
preservation. Therefore, support to small business of the local population will significantly
assist forest improvement.
Market capacity
The Laboratory Zone is not rich in land resources owing to its geographical situation. The
area of agricultural plots accounts for:
Lentekhi district                          21 % of the total area of land
Ambrolauri district                        25% of the total area of land
Oni district                               35% of the total area of land
Tsageri district                            20% of the total area of land
Agricultural products are virtually totally processed by private sector. In the Ambrolauri
district, plant-growing is the leading sector of agriculture, making up 60% of the total
agricultural products, while in other districts stock-breeding is given priority, making up 53%
in the district of Tsageri, 64% in Lentekhi. Stock-breeding is the leading sector of agriculture
in the Oni district, where 90% of the total agricultural products were processed in 1998.
Virtually, in every district, much of agricultural products are processed for personal use.
Thus, one of the main problems is lack of the market capacity causing low income. The local
population has difficulties with transportation and marketing of their goods. Road
constructions and rehabilitation, which from one hand, is a critical for the local population in
terms of facilitation of transportation and promotion of the local economy, from another hand,
could create easy access to the forest for non-residents and could contribute to increase of
forest use. This also could cause conflicts between the locals and non-local residents, and in
case of improper forest management and utilization - forest degradation. However, as it was
mentioned above, at the same time, roads will create opportunity for villagers to market their
goods, which could increase their income and decrease their dependence on the forest.
Therefore, roads construction with consideration of geological issues and relevant forest
regulations will assist improvement of forest conditions.

Education
After gaining independence, the educational materials and technical basis, which were rather
outdated in the Soviet times, became even poorer. The 1991 earthquake in the Racha
Region caused significant damages to the social institutions and worsened the situation.
According to 1998 data, an annual expenditure on education per capita was the following:
Lentekhi                                 20 GEL
Ambrolauri                               17 GEL
Oni                                      12.8 GEL
Tsageri                                  17.4 GEL
All the above-mentioned is a clear indication that the situation in the education system in the
study region is critical, which is conditioned mostly by shortage of funds, deficient material
and technical basis for educational institutions and inadequate qualification of teachersl°.
Privatization / Leasing
Individuals who thought that forest privatization would help forest improvement were in
minority in the focus groups. They believe that if the forest is privatized, people will protect it
more, owing it as a private property. However, taken into consideration existing hard
economical situation, dependence of the local residents of the lab region on the forest, it is
expected that the locals will continue woodcutting activities.
Privatization could accelerate forest degradation, since in private forest plots locals will be
able to cut wood more easily and the relevant governmental agencies will have additional
difficulties to control woodcutting on the privatized areas. Thus, at present, privatization as a
mean for the forest protection seems rather doubtful.
Public Participation
The local population of the Laboratory Zone lack even basic information and have mistrust in
most of the sources of information. Generally, locals are disregarded from social, economic,
political and nature resources management activities and decision-making.
This circumstance makes it very difficult to address forestry management issues in
sustainable way in the long term. Obviously, without active participation and involvement of
the local population, there is a little chance that government initiatives will be successful in
solution of the urgent forestry issues. However, Local participants appear to be eager to
learn more and participate in nature resource management and decision-making process of
their region.
ONI REGION
Industry
There are 38 industrial enterprises in the Oni district, out of which only 25 enterprises
function. Food industry is the leading sector of the industrial activities, proportion of which

comes to 50%, electro-engineering is represented by 19%, timber production, paper and
furniture industries by 10%11.
Poverty
According to the GORBI report, almost 50% of the respondents cannot buy food and clothes
due to unemployment and low income. The living standard of this region is worse than in
other three regions of the Lab Zone, since the main source of income is governmental
benefits (salaries, pensions, which are usually delayed or not paid) and remittances from
relatives. The local population is much depended on agriculture, crops and livestock raising
on their own or state owned lands. 92.7% of the local residents owns or exploits land and
only 4% intends to sell it. In Oni, households have primarily poultry, pigs, cattle, sheep,
goats.
Energy crisis
Each family, depended on its location, uses averagely 5 to 25 m3 firewood. Energy crisis is
greatly evident during the winter. Although, the information about the main sources of income
shows that forest-related activities have relatively minor contribution in the locals' income.
Alternative fuel is too expensive or unavailable for the locals, therefore, cutting and collecting
of wood for heating and cooking is critical for these regions.
Energy sources are distributed in the following way:
Wood                                            79.2%
Kerosene                                        17.5%
Electricity                                      3.3%
Almost all the local population in the Oni district uses firewood for heating and the majority
for cooking as well:
Firewood for cooking                            98.7%
Firewood for heating                             100%
* Opinion about forest condition
The most part of households thinks that forest condition have been degraded during past five
years, and a few people believes that condition has improved.
Condition of forest                                 %

The main causes of forest deterioration was named as:
Excessive wood cutting                           60.9%
Poaching                                         16.9%

Expansion of urban areas                           3.8%
The local residents think that to improve existing situation, the government should strengthen
control on wood export, introduce restrictions in forest utilization and make alternative fuel
resources more easily available on site.
* Lack of public information and awareness
One of the urgent issues is public information and awareness raising on forest related issues.
The problem is that the local population does not receive a sufficient amount of information
and they do not believe the most of the information they receive. With this regard, confidence
of the local population towards the source of information should be considered:
Source of information                       Confidence %
TV                                                  49.1
Friends and family                                    25

Forest managers                                        0
* Healthcare problems
Economical condition and psychological stress influences the health of the population. Most
of the locals consider that the health of their family members worsened over past five year:
Health condition                                      %
Worsened                                              50
Remained the same                                   47.3
Improved                                             2.7
As the main reasons of health worsening, the local population considers aging and
psychological stress.

Out-migration
Unemployment, difficult economic conditions and low income are the main reasons of out-
migration. As residents of Oni mentioned, there is little chances to return this people back in
existing socioeconomic situation. At least one family member (about 45%) of the households
leaves the village. Youth are most likely to leave their villages, depriving both families and
communities of the energy and strength needed to cut, collect fuel wood and to farm. Out-
migration is slowing economic growth in the region.
According to the GORBI report, main reasons of departure of local residents are:
Marriage                                        41.6%
Work in other places of Georgia                 32.8%
Education                                       11.5%
Work in other countries                          9.7%
Instability in the region                        4.4%
Obviously, out-migration changes demographics of the region; 36% of the population is over
the age of 55 and 17% under the age of 26.
*  Public participation
As SA found, the local population is willing to participate in the forest management activities,
but few of them have opportunity to do so. Almost all residents of the Oni region claimed that
no one from the national, state or commercial forest management authorities has asked them
for help or for their opinion. Although they believe that they must participate in forest
management, 1,2% does not know what they must do actually to "Take care of our
resources". This answer was named by 29,6% of population, 16% thinks they must
participate in afforestation.
LENTEKHI REGION
*  Industry
The industrial complex of Lentekhi is represented by electro-engineering, timber production,
paper and furniture industries. There are 30 industrial enterprises in the district, 26 of which
operate, most of them relate to the timber production.
* Poverty
According to the living standards, the population can be divided into the following classes:
Living standard                                     %
The poorest                                       45.3

The main jobs on site are crop cultivation and livestock raising. Their main problems the local
population is facing are the following:
Unemployment                                     22.2%
Delay in salary I pension                        16.4%
Low income                                       14.6%
The main sources of the income are: job, relatives' remittance, agriculture and livestock
(meat, dairy products). Most of the local residents grow fruit, vegetable and raise livestock
and it is very difficult for them to purchase products in the market.
Energy crisis
In Lentekhi, 99,3% of the locals uses wood for cooking and 99% for heating purposes. They
cannot afford to buy gas and kerosene; 12,4% uses electricity.
Georgia's energy crisis is acute especially during the winter. Urban areas often receive as
little as two hours of electricity a day and supply to rural areas is even less (usually electricity
supply is 2 hours per week). Rural inhabitants do not have access to alternative fuel and
generally cannot afford to utilize non-wood fuel. Their cooking and heating needs are met by
the only available energy supply - wood from the forests. All other potential supplies such as
kerosene, gas and electricity are too expensive or unavailable.
O Opinion about forest conditions
According to the GORBI report, 59,3% of the local population believes that forest is in the
same condition as in past, 46% thinks forest is deteriorated and only 0,7% regarded forest to
be improved.
As a main reason of the forest degradation, the locals mostly consider excessive
woodcutting, global climate changes and converting forest into agricultural lands:
Major causes of Forestry Degradation Given by the local population are:

In addition, as one of the reasons of forest degradation, the local residents consider poor
governmental management system. Around 32% of the locals think that control on wood
export must be intensified and 24.1% believes that the government must make altemative
fuel more available, 19.2% thinks there must be restrictions in forest use. The locals trust
mostly TV and radio, which should be used in the future for informing the population about
the forest related problems.

Healthcare problems
According to the GORBI report, 35% of the local population believe that the health of their
family members are worsened, the main reasons of what they consider the following:
Economic condition                               33.9%
Aging                                            32.1%
Reduced quality of health service                14.3%
Psychological stress                             11.6%
Insufficient food                                 6.3%
Poor quality of food                              1.8%
Poor quality drinking water                         0%
Inadequate sanitation                               0%
Around 2.7% of the local population considers that health conditions improved and 62%
believes that it remained the same.
* Out-migration
Poor living conditions, poverty and unemployment cause out-migration. The local population
of the Lentekhi region, seeking for better life conditions in other regions or abroad, is leaving
these places. This situation is rather painful and stresses psychologically the aged members
of family.
Public participation
As in the other regions of the Lab Zone, the local population is rather neglected during
decision-making process on social, economic, political and nature resources management
activities at the local level.
Around 99,3% of the local residents thinks that forest management authorities are not
encouraging their participation in forest management issues and activities. Although 43,8%
does not know public participation ways or tools for solving forest related problems, 26,4%
believes they can take part in afforestation activities. 13,1% of the locals is convinced that
people must not cut wood without licenses.
AMBROLAURI REGION
* Industry
Around 35 industrial enterprises function out of 70 existing in the Ambrolauri district. Food
industry and electro-engineering are the leading sectors, proportion of which is 43% and 42%
correspondingly. The food industry is mainly represented by the wine enterprises, which use
the endemic species of grapes. There is a considerable demand for the products both at the
internal and external markets. The timber production, paper and furniture industries are
represented by 4%.
* Poverty
The living standards in Ambrolauri are relatively better comparing with other regions
described above. 70.7% of population consists of the middle poor, 23.3% poorest and the
least poor comprise 6%, which is less than in the Oni and Lentekhi regions.

ACTA Consultants                                           Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
The local residents have three main sources of income: livestock (meat and dairy products),
relatives' remittances and crops. The locals are raising mostly poultry, cattle and pig.
Energy crisis
In comparison with other regions described above, there is a hydropower station in
Ambrolauri, which supplies mainly the town dwellers. However, since electricity is
unaffordable for locals, almost the whole population of the region uses wood fuel for heating
and cooking. Therefore, use of electricity is rather insignificant comparing with wood use,
which makes 90%.
* Opinion about forest condition
82% of the local population regarded forest resources to be deteriorated and 18% to be the
same. In the Ambrolauri region, no one believes that forest has been improved.
Opinion about forest condition                      %

The main reasons of forest deterioration according to the locals are:
-   Excessive wood cutting 68,8%
*   Poaching 16%
TSAGERI REGION
. Industry'
According to the 1999 data, the industrial complex of Tsageri is represented by 21
enterprises, out of which 19 are functioning. The growth rate of output came to 247,2%
compared with the corresponding period in 1998, largely due to the volume of electricity
generated by joint-stock company "Lajanurhesi". Electro-engineering is a leading sector of
industry (72%). There are enterprises of food industry specialized in wines made of unique
species of grapes in the Tsageri region.
* Poverty
The Tsageri region is in the best situation in terms of poverty:
can buy some expensive things                   0.7%
least poor population                          52.7%
middle poor                                      46%
poorest                                         0.7%
Population of none of regions described above can afford buying expensive things. Income
of the local residents mostly depends on trade, relatives' remittances, salary and livestock.
* Trade of forest related products
25



ACTA Consultants                                              Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
Trade of forest related products is not a main activity for the local population of all four
regions located in Laboratory Zone. Residents of Lentekhi receive less than 6% of their cash
income from this activity. Population of Tsageri is greatly dependant on agricultural activities.
Energy crisis
Although the local population depends on wood, there is a better condition in the Tsageri
region in terms of using alternative fuel.
Fuel
Wood                                             90.5%

Kerosene                                          7.1%
* Opinion about forest conditions
Around 79% of local residents thinks that forests are degraded, the main causes of which
they consider excessive wood cutting, poaching and economical poverty. The local residents
believe that the government should strengthen control on wood export and make alternative
fuel more easily available to improve forest conditions.

2.2  Physical description of the Lab Zone
Geographical and administrative borders of the study area (Laboratory Zone)
Study area consists of four, medium and high mountainous administrative districts of Georgia
- Lentekhi, Tsageri, Oni and Ambrolauri. Lentekhi district belongs to the Lower Svaneti region
and is surrounded from the North by Mestia (Upper Svaneti) and from the South by
Lechkhumi region. Tsageri is the administrative center of the region. Eastern and
northeastern parts of the study area (about 70% of the total area) belong to the Ambrolauri
(Lower Racha administrative unit) and Oni (Upper Racha administrative unit) regions.
Similarity of physical-geographical conditions and peculiarities of relief stipulates expedient of
join description for all above regions.
Climate
The complicated relief of the region conditions the variety of the climate. The following
topographic features directly affect the climate:
1.  Altitude that ranges from 150 to 4,000 m;
2.  Mountain massif of the Great Caucasus range as well as its adjacent ranges;
3.  Existence of the glaciers and snow beds in the high-mountainous part;
4.  Black Sea that keeps the warmth and large amounts of precipitation within the region;
5.  Geographic location of the region that predetermines significant positive balance of
much of its territory;
6.  Distinctive division between the plain and mountainous parts of the relief, orientation
of the major ranges and their steep slopes.
Significant amplitude of the absolute elevations determines a distinct vertical zoning, ranging
from the subtropical climatic elements of Kvemo Racha to everlasting glaciers of the Great
Caucasus range. The following vertical zones could be identified:
1.   Humid climate with temperate cold winter and long warm summer at 1,200 m;
2.   Humid climate with temperate warm summer and cool winter at 1,200-2,300 m;
3.   Humid climate with short cool summer and long winter at 2,300-3,500 m;
4.   High-mountain climate;
5.   Climate with everlasting glaciers and snow beds over 3,300 m.
Complicated orographic conditions greatly affect climates of each zone as well as
egzodynamic process, their orientation and intensity, determining their morphosculptural
variety largely.
Air masses that dominate in the Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti regions are
determined by northeast and southwest wind directions with average velocity of 2-2,5m/%.
Northeast winds that reach considerable speeds at some places are formed in the autumn-
winter. The contact of the high-pressure area formed on the territory of the North Caucasus
with low-pressure area from the Black Sea causes air masses to be shifted from the East to
the West. At some places, speed of winds reaches 30-40 m/,
27



ACTA Consultants                                         Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
Winds of west origin are borne in the summer, when the high-pressure area is formed on the
Black Sea, while there is the low-pressure area in the interior of the continent. Such winds
tend to carry abundant moisture.
Temperature is marked with diversity. Average annual temperature ranges from +14,50C to -
2,40C. January is considered as the coldest period; the temperature in January ranges
between +5,20C and -12°C, while the temperature in August reaches +24°C.
Temperature gradient is of little significance in high-mountain zones and its annual changes
are distinctive. The annual amplitude of temperature comes to 220C in major parts of the
region (500-1,600 m), while in high-mountain zones it comes to 18-19°C. The same is
characteristic for the difference between minimal and maximum temperatures.
The annual distribution and intensity of precipitation changes significantly with increase in
elevation. Distribution of precipitation is affected by the Black Sea as well as by the
orientation of the ranges. Average annual amount of precipitation in the study area reaches
1,200 mm. The atmospheric precipitation mainly is represented by rain, seldom by wet snow.
According to longstanding observation data, the annual value of precipitation in Oni and
Ambrolauri districts fluctuates from -1,200 to -1,400 mm and increases considerably within
the Tsageri and Lentekhi districts, where this index reaches 1,800 mm. For example,
Precipitation in Oni town at 700-800 m asl is 971 mm, in the surroundings of Utsera -
reaches 1,387 mm, conditioned by orographic conditions, namely by the Shoda-Kedela
range.
Precipitation in the form of snow can be observed in low mountain areas in November - April,
at the elevation of 1,500 m - in October-May, while at the elevation of 2,800 m, precipitation
in the form of snow can occur in the summer. The thickness of snow cover corresponds to
increase of elevation. Thickness of snow cover is 30-34 cm at 400-800 m asl, while it is 56
cm at 1,000-1,600 m, and 90-110 cm at the elevation of 2,500 m. In lowland areas, the
maximum thickness of snow cover comes to 150 cm, while in highland areas to 350 cm.
Despite the large amounts of precipitation within the region, sometimes droughts also occur
that can last for 25-30 days. In this period, precipitation is either too low or equal to zero.
Summer droughts sometimes comprise the whole region.
At the lower elevations, the stable snow-cover is rare phenomenon. Within the central part of
the Great Caucasus, strong snowstorms are observed and fogs are spread in summer
period.
Relief
The relief of the Central Caucasus region is distinguished with high cormplexity. The region is
divided into several physical-geographical areas.
Great Caucasus range borders Svaneti from the North and divides it into two parts - Zemo
(upper) and Kvemo (lower) Svaneti.
The Great Caucasus range is the highest part of the Caucasus within the region. The altitude
of highest peaks exceeds 5,000 m.
Study area comprises Svaneti, Lechkhumi and Racha ridges, which serve as watershed for
rivers coming from the south slope of the Great Caucasus.
Tectonic, erosive, geomorphologic and other classical processes as well as glaciers are key
factors that formed the present relief of the Central Caucasus.
28



ACTA Consultants                                          Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
The following large orographic features can be distinguished within the lab zone:
1.   Major watershed range, including its wide branches;
2.   Svaneti range;
3.   Plains of the Tskhenistskali river;
4.   Lechkhumi Range;
5.   North slope of the Khvamli massif;
6.   Rioni plains (the Racha depression that extends to the village of Tvishi);
7.   North slope of the Racha range.
The Great Caucasus range:
The crest of the Major watershed range is oriented towards the Greater Caucasus. Great
part of the Lentekhi and Oni districts (especially their northern part) belongs to the main
range of the Great Caucasus and its south slope. Relief is represented by ridges of meridian
direction of medium altitude and flattened areas between ranges. The Racha-Svaneti section
is its major part within the region.
Besides the widely developed tectogenic-erosional high and medium mountainous relief
there are glacial, early glacial, karst (cockpit), landslide and mountain creep forms of relief.
The crest of the Great Caucasus is narrow, with cogged high and very steep slopes.
Meridional ranges are also characterized by vertical or very steep slopes, transformed
gradually to the South into the medium mountainous, less intersected, relief with elevations
about 600-1,200 m and relative altitude from riverbed 200-300 m.
The Racha-Svaneti section is composed of oldest crystal rocks. Several different formations
can be observed there:
a)  Crystalline strata, gneiss, etc.;
b)  Gray granite of the Major range;
c)  Granodiorites.
Several morphological complexes are typical for the relief of the Great Caucasus range:
1.   Rocky and glacial mountain peaks that are characterized by abrasion and intensive
glacial processes;
2.   Recent glaciers and V-shaped valleys;
3.   Early glacial abrasion and accumulative forms;
4.   Erosive forms.
Abrasion is the key process in the glacial-nival zone that forms steep-slope peaks as a result
of glacial weathering; correspondingly pyramid-shaped inaccessible peaks are formed. Most
of these peaks are characterized by steep and rocky forms. The trace of the glacial period is
well marked along the Racha-Lechkhumi section.
Moraines and troughs of late glacial period descend to the elevations of 1,200-1,500 m in
Svaneti and Racha. The troughs in the Racha section of the Great range are less distinct;
they come down to the elevation of 1,600-1,700 m.

Water erosive forms of the relief are developed along the south slope of the Great Caucasus
range. Terraces can be rarely found on the slopes; they occupy small areas.
The Kvemo (Lower) Svaneti depression
The Kvemo (Lower) Svaneti depression has a latitudinal orientation. The lowest point of the
depression located in Lentekhi is at 706 m asl. The Kvemo Svaneti depression is composed
of the Jurassic sandstones. The Tskhenistskali River lowland, which has a latitudinal
orientation from the Shushara River mouth, changes its orientation and morphological
character several times. Above areas are densely populated and covered by agricultural
activities.
The Kvemo Svaneti depression is smaller and deeper than the Zemo Svaneti depression.
The erosional and denudative relief prevails in the area and is represented by comparatively
gentle forms.
The Rstkmeluri gorge unites the Kvemo Svaneti depression with the Lechkhumi (Tsageri)
depression. The gorge has a sub-meridian orientation and stretches over 16 km from
Lentekhi to Tsageri. The gorge is composed of the lower Jurassic sandy-schist strata, middle
Jurassic porphyritic stratum and at the lower section by Cretaceous gravel mass. The V-
shaped gorge has series of erosive stairs on the slopes.
The Racha depression is bordered by the watershed range from the North and East and is
separated from the Kvemo Svaneti by the Lechkhumi range. Racha is divided into two parts:
Kvemo (Ambrolauri district) and Zemo (Oni district) Racha.
The altitude of the major watershed range decreases towards west-northwest direction,
which is its main morphological peculiarity.
The Racha range
The Racha range, which is a branch of the Caucasus range at the Zekara mountain, runs
westwards and in the Tvishi village borders the Rioni river gorge. Cretaceous rocks form
west part of the range. The middle Jurassic porphyritic compounds and lower Cretaceous
flysch are developed in the east part.
Western part of the Racha range represents a classical massif of the mountainous karst with
different distinctive karst relief forms. The east part is marked by erosion; while the upper
zones are marked by glacial forms.
The Racha depression
The Racha depression is the basin of the upper section of the Rioni River from the Tvishi
village. The Racha depression in comparison with the Kvemo Svaneti depression is much
more diverse in lithological constituents, tectonic conditions and age. Multiplicity of granite of
the early Paleozoic period and crystalline rocks is determined by the existence of the major
watershed range.
The Tsageri depression
The Tsageri depression is bordered by the branches of the Odishi range on the northwest,
the Lechkhumi lowland on the southeast and the Askha and Khvamli massifs on the
southwest. The depression has a long axis that is oriented from northeast to southeast. It is
formed with terrigenous, at some places, carbonaceous rocks, the age of which ranges from
Oligocene to Sarmatian. The south-westernmost and north-easternmost parts of the
depression are formed by Eocene clays, marls and Cretaceous rocks. The bottom of the
30



ACTA Consultants                                           Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
depression is formed by terraces composed of Quaternary alluvial sediments. Slopes of the
depression are covered by Oligocene-Neogene stratum and are characterized by lowland
relief and contain landslide sections.
Altitude of the Shua (central) Lechkhumi highland is 500-600 m and represents the left side
of the depression. Right side of the Tsageri depression is wider and reaches 6 km.
The Lechkhumi range
The Lechkhumi range deviates from the Great Caucasus range at the Pasa Mountain and is
oriented southwestwards up to the Chutkharo mountain. Further, its direction coincides with
the direction of the Great Caucasus range. The Lechkhumi range is a watershed between
the Tskhenistkali River and the right tributaries of the Rioni River as well as the left tributaries
of the Tskhenistskali. The cross section of the Lechkhumi range is quite asymmetric: its
northern slope is short with few branches and plains, while the southern slope, directed
towards Lechkhumi, is quite long and dismembered into numerous branches and river
basins. Composition of the range, which is similar to the Svaneti range, is composed of early
Jurassic sandy stratum and has the identical relief forms, but with lower altitudes.
Hydrography
The Central Caucasus is located within the catchments of the Rioni River, belonging to the
Black Sea Basin.
The Rioni originates from glaciers of the southern slopes of the Great Caucasus range (the
area of the Pasa Mountain at 2,960 m). The Rioni River (along the section Brili-Gebi-Glola)
runs through the wide gorge from northwest to southeast and funnels through the narrow
rocky gorge southward, crossing the Shoda Kedela range. From the Oni town, Rioni has a
sub-latitudinal orientation and flows westwards in a wide terraced riverbed. The Khidikari
section is an exception, where it reaches the narrow gorge, but passing the Ambrolauri-
Chrebalo district the gorge widens again. From the Alpana village the river turns towards the
South and flows through the narrow gorge that turns into canyon at the village of Tvishi.
Parameters of hydrological regime of the Rioni River are given below:
Length                                                      337 km
Catchments area                                           13,418 km2
Average elevation point of the basin                        1,086 m
Altitude difference of the canyon                           2,495 m
Average perennial discharge                                 -410 m3/S
Average perennial depth of the run-off                       995 mm
Floods in the Rioni River occur from March till October. Accidental floods are frequent and
are repeated almost during the whole year.
The main right tributaries of Rioni are: Sakaura, Lukhuni, Ritseula, Lajanuri, Tskhenistskali.
The left tributaries are: Chanchakhi, Gharula, Jejora, Lekhidari.
The Tskhenistskali River, which is the largest tributary of the Rioni River, represents the main
hydrographic element on the territory of Lentekhi and Tsageri districts. The Tskhenistskali
River joins Rioni beyond the Lab Zone limits. Source of the Tskhenistskali River is the Great
Caucasus range at the Pasa Mountain at the altitude of 2,710 m.

Main tributaries of the Tskhenistskali River within the study area are Laskanura, Kvedrula,
Lektareshi, Januali rivers. Canyons of these tributaries are steep and are covered with dense
forest. The main parameters of hydrological regime of the Tskhenistskali River are as
following:
Length                                                         183 km
Catchments area                                              2,122 km2
Average elevation point of the basin                           1,660 m
Altitude difference of the canyon                              2,695 m
Average longstanding discharge                               80,6 m3/,
Average longstanding depth of the run-off                    1,301 mm
River canyon is deep whose steep slopes are covered by forest. Gradually, closer to the
Tsageri district, canyon is transformed into middle mountainous zone. The tributary is
nourished by snow and rains, while the upper segment of the basin by glaciers. As majority
of mountainous rivers, the Tskhenistskali River is characterized with extremely not stable
hydrological regime. Floods are frequent, especially from spring till early autumn and 70% of
superficial runoff comes on this period. In winter, this figure is minimal and does not exceed
10%.
Large and medium-sized lakes are not found within the region. Small-sized Kvedi lake is
situated in the basin of the Jojora River at 1,567 m. The area of its basin is 11,8 km2.
Network of rivers in the lake basin is quite dense. The Kvedrula, its principal river, has many
small tributaries. It flows into the lake on the East and flows out on the West. The main water
supplier of the lake is the Kvedrula River. The surface area of the lake is 9 ha, the maximum
depth 14,5 m, average - 8,2 m, volume is 0,71 million m3.
The Shaori reservoir, located within the Ambrolauri district, was formed in 1954 after the
Shaori (Didichala) had been dammed up. The surface area of the Shaori reservoir is 126
kM2, altitude 1,133 m, the average depth 7 m, the maximum depth 15,2 m, the length of the
coastline 25 km.
Soils
According to the latest (1999) classification of soils in Georgia, the main soil forming rocks
developed within the Lab Zone are (see Figure 8):
Porphyrites, andesites, partly carbonaceous rocks -
Oni district              limestones, marls, dolomites
Lentekhi district         Mainly metamorphic schists and clayey schists
Tsageri and Ambrolauri    Mainly Loeses, Loesic loams, clay schists, etc. Subordinating
districts                 role take porphyrites and andesites, sometimes -
carbonaceous rocks
There is a significant vertical difference in the project region, ranging from 400 m to 5,000 m
asl. The following soil types are found in the Central Caucasus region:
mountain-meadow primitive,
mountain-meadow,

gray-brown acid,
*    gray-brown podsols,
*    yellow-brown,
*    humus-carbonate,
*    humus-karst red,
*    alluvial acid,
*    highly eroded soils and exposed rocks.
High-mountainous soils occupy the highest positions in the vertical zoning. These soils are
formed in the sub-alpine and alpine zones above 2,000 m altitude. The mountain-meadow
soils are most common. These soils are marked by undifferentiated profile.
Pastures are located on the mountain-meadow soils. Mountain-meadow asymmetric soils are
quite common. They are characterized by absence of one of the genetic horizons.
Mountain-meadow peaty soils are formed in two completely different ecological conditions.
On the one hand, they are common under rhododendrons. The formation of peat is a result
of so-called "dry peat forming", when peat is accumulated in humid environments. On the
other hand, the mountain-meadow peaty soils are characterized by spread in highly humid
environments around water sources (riversides, lakeside).
The mountain-meadow peaty soils are characterized by medium and small thickness, except
the peaty horizons. The principal soil-forming processes are: accumulation of peat, humus-
formation, humus-podsolization, structuring.
Mountain-forest-meadow soils are formed in the sub-alpine zone in the sub-alpine forests.
They are distinguished by undifferentiated profile, by humus horizons- the dark brown soils.
The principal soil-forming processes are: humus-podsolization and humus-formation.
The gray-brown soils (acid and podsols) occupy the largest area at of 1,000-2,000 m under
different types of forests.
Yellow-brown soils are common at 450-9,000 m under weathered volcanic rocks.
The principal soil-forming processes of the yellow-brown soils are: humus-formation and
weathering.
The humus-carbonate soils are mainly formed in the forest zone on rocks containing large
amounts of calcium-carbonate (limestone, marble, dolomite, etc.) and are characterized by
leaching and periodically leaching regime. These soils exhibit well-developed humus
horizons.
The alluvial soils are spread on limited areas under terraces of flood plains. These soils are
characterized by acid, neutral or alkali reactions, (depending on the basin where they
develop), as well as by middle or low composition of humus.
The arable soils of the study area are rather eroded, which is caused by wide distribution of
annual crops as well as discounting of the elementary agrotechnical requirements. The figure
of erosion exceeds 70%.
The region is characterized by interesting soils and topsoil.

According to the scheme of physical-geographic zoning, the study area belongs to the Great
Caucasus Southern Slope mountainous region and mainly is characterized by abundant and
moderately humid mountain-forest landscape, where brown, humus - calcareous - rendzic
leptosols, forest podzolic soils are developed. Southwards, on the territory of the Ambrolauri
district, yellow and red raw humus calcareous and mountain meadow soils occur as well.
Geomorphology
According to the scheme of geomorphologic division of Georgia, Oni and Lentekhi districts
are located mainly within the zone of folded ranges and massifs, composed by terrigenous-
volcanic formations of Jurassic and Tertiary periods - represented by clay-schists,
sandstones, porphyrites, tuff breccias, rarely limestone.
Characterizing geomorphologic elements are nival-glacial and erosional-glacial ranges and
massifs. Within the Tsageri and Ambrolauri districts, dominated geomorphologic elements
are represented by structural piedmont zone. It is characterized by fracture-folded and
monoclinal structure and composed mainly by Tertiary terrigenous facies - conglomerates,
sandy-clayey and carbonaceous formations. The characteristic form of relief here is
denudation-erosional piedmont.
Landscapes
Composition of landscapes in the Laboratory Zone (Racha-Lechkhumi and Lower Svaneti)
could be summarized as follows:
* One (1) class of landscapes;
*   Four (4) types: low mountainous, medium-mountainous, upper-mountainous and Alpine;
*   Eight (8) subtypes;
*   Twelve (12) families; and
*   Thirty nine (39) series
Classification of landscapes is given according to landscape families. The bottom of the
Racha-Lechkhumi depression is represented principally by the low-mountainous moderately
warm humid landscapes. They represent two landscape families:
*   30th low-mountainous karst with mixed oak-grove, deciduous and evergreen forests;
and
*   31s' mountainous depression low-mountainous erosive-accumulative landscape with
mixed oak and deciduous forests.
At the altitude of 600-800 m, above-mentioned landscapes are gradually replaced by
medium-mountainous moderately warm humid landscapes of Kolkheti (H2) represented by
two families:
*   36th medium-mountainous erosive-denudative landscape with mixed, evergreen
forests and
*   37h medium-mountainous karst landscape with mixed and evergreen forests.
The 36h landscape occupies a large territory. It is bounded on the southwest by the 30'h and
31st landscapes, where it embrace the northem part of the Tsageri depression and stretches
34



ACTA Consultants                                           Sectoral Environmental Assessment

upstream to the Kvemo Svaneti depression, where it is bounded by the northern branches of
the Lechkhumi range. In the Ambrolauri district, the 36'h landscape is bordered on the North
by the Rioni River
At 1,000-1,200 m, above listed landscapes are replaced by medium-mountainous moderately
cold landscapes (K) with mixed forests and mountainous chernozem soils (black earth). In
the Shovi district, they are bordered by coniferous forests. Two landscape families are
encountered in the project region:
st51  medium-mountainous erosive-  More widespread in the project region, which
51 - medive-montaith mixe-        embraces the slopes of the Svaneti, Lechkhumi and
denudative landscape with mixed,  Shoda-Kedla ranges, and the Racha and Caucasus
coniferous forests (spruce, abies)  ranges in the East
52nd medium-mountainous karst with    Found on the Askha plateau and the northern
mixed-coniferous and evergreen forests  slopes of the Racha range
The upper-mountainous moderately cold forest landscape (T2) is represented only by the
54th landscape family, that is known as the upper-mountainous erosive-denudative, rarely
paleoglacial, landscape with coniferous and oak forests. The mentioned landscape is
bounded by the 51st landscape, which comprises the Egrisi, Svaneti, Lechkhumi, Shoda-
Kedla and Great Caucasus ranges.
At 2,000 m, they are replaced by high-mountainous sub-alpine meadow shrub landscapes
(L1), which are represented by three landscape families:
*   58th high-mountainous denudative paleoglacial landscape with high and dense grassy
meadows and shrubberies,
*   59th high-mountainous karst thick grassy meadows and sparse forests, and
*   64th high-mountainous denudative and paleoglacial landscape with sub-alpine
meadows and sparse forests.
Hypsometrica!ly, the 58th is bordered by the 52nd landscape and extends to the slopes of the
Egrisi, Svar   Lechkhumi, Shida-Kedela and Great Caucasus ranges. The 59th landscape is
found on tht oopes of the Racha range and in the southernmost part of the region.
The high-mountainous sub-nival landscapes (L3) are represented only by one landscape
family (70) that is spread at 2,800-4,000 m asl. Thus, it comprises the upper parts of the
Egrisi, Svaneti and Great Caucasus ranges.
The glacial-nival landscape (M) is represented by 72nd landscape family, i.e. glaciers. It is
found in the northwestern part of the region and comprises the peaks of the Great Caucasus
watershed range.
Geology
Stratigraphy
The major watershed range in the Lab Zone mostly coincides with the Caucasus geological
axis. Eastwards of the Mamisoni pass the watershed range deviates from the geological axis
to the South and enters the stratigraphic-tectonic zone of the Great Caucasus range (see
Figure 9).

The Caucasus principally seats on Mesozoic and early Mesozoic rocks. Arrangement of the
rocks depends on the geological zoning. The oldest rocks are located in the axial zone of the
Caucasus. To the South of the geological axis, the stratigraphic complexes are presented in
the form of lines stretched along the axis of the Great Caucasus range from west-northwest
to east-southeast. Their geological age is gradually decreasing. The oldest lower Paleozoic
rock formations are presented by crystalline rocks (granite, crystalline schist). Such rocks are
stretched along the major watershed. range till the Mamisoni pass. The upper Paleozoic
metamorphic rocks (sandstone, quartzite, phyllite, marble) are found in the form of a narrow
line along the Great Caucasus range.
The largest part of the area is occupied by the Jurassic rocks, bordering the Kvemo (Lower)
Svaneti depression, the Svaneti range and the Lechkhumi and Egrisi ranges. Rocks of the
late Jurassic period are presented by clays and sandstones. The middle Jurassic period is
characterized by volcanic rocks (porphyry, tuff, tuff conglomerates). As for upper Jurassic, it
is connected with Cretaceous systems and is mainly represented by carbonaceous rocks
(marls, schist, marly clay).
Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are marked by homogeneous schist stratum. They surround
the Lechkhumi and Racha depressions from the North to the South. These depressions were
drained comparatively later, that is why they are presented by Paleogene, less by Neogene,
fine terrigenous (conglomerates, sandstones and clays), as well as carbonaceous
sedimentary rocks.
Glacial and fluvial, as well as talus and proluvial sedimentary rocks, are most common
among the Quaternary sediments.
The oldest crystalline rocks are connected with the glacial-nival zone of the Great Caucasus
range, characterized by distinct rocky relief. Such relief is marked by firmness of denudative,
granite and gneiss massif.
The Jurassic clay-sandstone sediments zone determines existence of the relatively gentle
relief. This is caused by low hypsometric elevation (only a few reach the glacial-nival zone)
and denudation of the clay-sandstone sedimentary rocks. The sections composed of the
middle Jurassic volcanic sediments are quite distinctive in this gentle relief.
The Cretaceous rocks are characterized by karstic relief with weak erosional splits, where
caves and caverns of typically karst origin are found. The classical karst line is encountered
to the South of the Askhi and Khvamli massifs.
The Racha-Lechkhumi depression (they are often referred to as separate depressions) is of
synclinal origin and is composed of the Tertiary terrigenous sedimentary rocks.
As it was mentioned above, north part of the study area (Lentekhi and Oni districts),
geologically is located within zone of development of thick, terrigenous, Lower Jurassic (Lias
- J11) formation. Clay-schist, sandstone and rarely limestone represent above formation.
Besides Middle Jurassic (Bajocian - J2), porphyritic formation is widespread on the north part
of the Oni district, which is built by Porphyrite and their pyroclastolites (volcanic tuff),
sandstones, schists. Southward Upper Jurassic (J3) carbonaceous formations - limestone,
marls, sandstones, conglomerates occur in the study area.
In the Lentekhi district, together with above-mentioned Lower Jurassic formation, Upper
Paleozoic - Triassic (P, - T) metamorphic rocks are wide spread, which are represented by
Aspidic clay-schists and quartzites.
Middle Miocene (N12) terrigenous facies is dominant within the Tsageri and Ambrolauri
districts and is represented by sandstones, claystones, clay-limestone and conglomerates.
Above-mentioned formation builds up the axial zone of the Lechkhumi and Racha synclines.
Oligocene - Lower Miocene (Maicop series) clays and sandstone are developed on the wings

of these synclines. Upper Cretaceous limestone, marls, sandstones and volcanic formations
occur on the peripheries.
Tectonics
According to the scheme of Geotectonic Zoning of Georgia (Academician P. Gamkrelidze,
1964), all the studied districts tectonically are situated within the Great Caucasus South
Slope folded system (II), which is divided on separate tectonic zones.
Lentekhi district is situated on the boundary of two large tectonic units - Upper Paleozoic and
Triassic metamorphosed clay-schist zone (113) on the North and porphyritic Jurassic sub-zone
on the South (1142). This sub-zone spreads all over the Oni district.
Above mentioned tectonic zones and sub-zones of the Great Caucasus South Slope
(developed from Northwest to the Southeast) during the Paleozoic, Triassic, Jurassic,
Cretaceous and partly Paleogene were the entire geosynclie, composed by thick
sedimentary and volcanic-sedimentary formations. Rocks are intensively folded, fractured,
heavily compressed and overturned to the South as isocline or asymmetric folds of general
Caucasian direction.
Tsageri and Ambrolauri districts (disposed southwards) belong to the Racha-Lechkhumi
synclinal sub-zone (il45), characterized by smooth tectonics, relatively gentle and wide
secondary synclinal folds altering with narrow and steep anticlynal folds.
Seismic Conditions
According to the latest data of macroseismic zoning of Georgia, earthquakes of 8 degree of
Richter surface-wave magnitude (Ms) can occur within Oni and Ambrolauri districts. Within
the Tsageri and Lentekhi districts, the same figure varies in range of 6-7 Ms.
According to the degree of seismic activity, the Oni and Ambrolauri districts are very notable.
Prognostic epicenters of strong earthquakes with magnitude (Ms>) 4-5 are located there.
Relatively favorable situation exists on the territory of Tsageri and particularly in the Lentekhi
district, where the frequency of epicenters on each square trapezium does not exceed 0-5,
when the same figure within Oni and Ambrolauri districts is 5-15.
Quaternary Geology, Recent Geodynamic Processes
Strongly carved relief of the study area, dense network of deep and steep ravines of
mountainous rivers with unstable regimes, variety and complexity of geological structure,
tectonics, and hydrogeological conditions in a whole, stipulate abundance of different types
and intensity of recent Geodynamic Processes. These recent geodynamic processes are:
weathering, rock avalanches, rock falls, taluses, collapses, mudflows, mud streams,
landslips, landslides, linear and vertical erosion, etc.
One of the most significant issues in forest use to be foreseen as a direct impact on the
environment is activation of erosion and gravitational processes caused by mismanagement
of forest resources. At present, it is impossible to give scientifically proven forecast without
consideration of development, thickness, lithology, physical, mechanical and aquatic
properties of the Quaternary sediments (cover).
The Quaternary cover is well developed on the study area. Rocks are represented by
different kinds of ground. The most significant are:
*   Alluvial and alluvial-proluvial sediments;
*   Glacial formations;
*   Late Quatemary and recent alluvial and fluvial-glacial sediments;
37



ACTA Consultants                                           Sectorat Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
*   Eluvial-talus and proluvial-talus loams and gravel;
*   Colluvial sediments, represented by gravel and rock fragments.
Within the Tsageri and Lentekhi districts, base rock outcrops often occur.
The most frequent gravitational processes on the study area are active landslides, and
potential and stabilized landslides. For example, according to the State Cadastre, there are
over 70 active landslides identified and described within the Tsageri administrative district in
the ravines of the Tskhenistkali River and its tributaries.
The most of landslides are formed on the Miocene geological substratum (sandstones, clay
stones, and marls), although landslides are developed on the older geological substratum as
well (Lias and Bajocian terrigenous and volcanic-sedimentary formations).
Thickness of the landslide bodies range in wide diapason from 3-5 m up to 50 m and is
connected with different thickness of Quaternary cover. Most of landslides belong to the
plastic type of landslides.
Consequent sliding landslides are rarely developed. As it is known, they occur in case of
coincidence of rock strike and grade of slope. Large landslides, with several hundreds of
meters in length and width occur quite often; most of landslides are of medium or small size.
Relatively low intensity of landslide process is expressed on the territory of the Oni district.
According to the State Cadastre, 30 active landslides are identified there. Most part of these
landslides belongs to the Category of Large Landslides. Sometimes area of landslip exceeds
1 km2. Thickness of the sliding body is important as well. It varies between 5-15 m and
mainly is represented by talus loams with abundant coarse inclusions of bedrock.
The main part of the landslides exposed on the area are developed on the terrigenous
volcanic sub-stratum of Lower, Middle and Upper Jurassic represented by clayey schists,
sandstones, marls, limestone, etc. Natural inclination of landslide slopes range in limits of 15-
450
In the Lentekhi and Ambrolauri districts, high degree of landslide damage is observed. Most
of 40 landslides described there belong to the active group, a number of potential landslide
areas occur as well.
Mainly Oligocene clays represent sliding geological sub-stratum, partly - Sarmatic
sandstones and clays. Thick (up to 20 m) eluvial-talus cover represented by plastic clays and
loams is developed on the mentioned sub-stratum.
Therefore, main part of the landslides belongs to the plastic group. As a rule, landslides of
this group are large and sliding area reaches 1-1,5 km2.
Active landslides are developed on the slopes of the Rioni River and its tributaries (Sakoria,
Askistskali, Pepelas Khevi, etc.) covered by forest. Sliding of settlements and agricultural
land often occur as well on this territory.
Among the other geodynamic processes, characterizing for the West Caucasus Range, it is
necessary to mention snow avalanches, rock falls, taluses, erosion, etc. With regards of
forest use and agricultural purposes, the special attention deserves soil erosion. Therefore,
this issue is subject of separate discussion, which is given below as general recommendation
(Chapter 10).

Hydrogeology
According to the Scheme of Hydrogeological Zoning (I. Buachidze, 1970), main part of the
study area belongs to the hydrogeological region (II) of water pressure system of Great
Caucasus South Slope. The later covers wide part of piedmont and high mountainous zone
and consists of several hydrogeological sub-regions.
Among these sub-regions, the Svaneti fracture water pressure system (112) is extremely
important since it covers both the Lentekhi and Oni districts. Dizi series (Pz-T) and Upper
and Middle Jurassic metamorphic, sedimentary and volcanic rocks compose this
hydrogeological sub-region. Water bearing capacity of above mentioned rocks changes in
accordance with rock joining and varies between 5-30 I/s. Small discharge springs (0.1-0.5
I/s) occur within zones of weak joining covered by the crust of weathering. Groundwater
mineralization is low up to 0.4 g/l. Temperature fluctuates from 7 to 120C. Carbon-sour
mineral water spreads within the Lentekhi district. Mineralization varies in wide range from
0.3 up to 18.0 g/l.
Tsageri and Ambrolauri districts hydro-geologically belong to the Racha-Lechkhumi artesian
basin of fracture and fracture-karstic water (1114). Above mentioned basin spreads all over the
Racha-Lechkhumi synclinorium, composed by Mesozoic-Cainozoic sediments. The main
water bearing horizons and complexes are connected with Middle Jurassic volcanic-
sedimentary formations (Porphyritic series) and partly with Quaternary alluvial-talus cover.
Karstic-fracture groundwater connected with Valanginian-Barremian thick-bedded limestone
is developed on the south part of study area. In the submerged zones of Bajocian and
Bathian stage, chloride-sodium and chloride calcium (sometimes sulphate) waters occur.
Within the tectonic rupture zones carbon-sour mineral water of hydrocarbon-chloride
composition is spread. Mineralization is up to 5 g/l. Natural resources of sub-terranian water
for the mentioned hydrogeological sub-region is evaluated as 26 m3/s. The main source for
natural resources is groundwater and partly pressured waters.
Deposits of Mineral Resources
Among deposits of mineral resources developed throughout the study area, the most
significant are Chordi barite deposit in the Oni district and Lukhumi arsenic deposit in the
Ambrolauri district. Except the mentioned ones, a large deposit of manganese is located in
Shkmeri (Ambrolauri district), which has been explored geologically, but has never been
exploited.
Ore valley of the Chordi hydrothermal deposit links to the south wing of Chordi-Sokhti
anticline, composed by Bajocian porphyritic series. Reserves are evaluated as approximately
1,5 million tons. This deposit has been intensively worked during the Soviet era and has
been main supplier of raw material for the Kutaisi lithophone works. Recently, mining of the
deposit was ceased.
Region of Lukhumi (Lower Racha) Realgar-Auripigment deposit is composed by thick Upper
Jurassic - Lower Cretaceous clay-carbonaceous flysch rocks. According to reserves deposit
belongs to group of Medium Deposit. It has been intensively worked during the Soviet times
and materials were mainly exported to Russia. At present, preparation works for mining in full
capacity are going on.

General Recommendations
Description of physical environment and general recommendations are based on analysis of
existing geological and aerial photography materials.
Due to the fact, that the work was fulfilled in wintertime and there was not possibility for field
works, specific objects with relevant concrete recommendations are not given in the present
report. Nevertheless, it is not necessary due to identical natural conditions of all four districts.
Due to the fact that recent geodynamic processes of different kind and intensity take place in
the Oni, Ambrolauri, Tsageri and Lentekhi mountainous districts, forest related activities
should be managed according to the optimal methodology and technology to minimize risk
on the environment.
No official figures concerning negative impact to the environment caused directly by forest
utilization during last 10 years is available. Unfortunately, this issue is not enough highlighted
in the Forests Development Program preparation report.
Special attention deserves the danger of activation of such geodynamic processes as
erosion in general, and specifically soil erosion, landslides, mudflows and avalanches.
Prevention of snow avalanche and reduction of its energy by forest is possible only upslope.
In the middle and lower parts, vegetation cover practically could not ensure extinction of
avalanche's kinetic energy. Consequently, danger of snow avalanches exists upslope of high
mountains, therefore, heavy logging is inadmissible in such places and this requirement
should be strictly observed.
Considering dense hydrographical network, complicated and intensively curved relief,
formation of mudflow hearts and furthers activation of mudflow processes is an urgent issue
in terms of negative environmental impact of unsystematic forest cuts.
Entire surface of structural and turbulent mud stream's area in Georgia is 18,500 km2.
Approximately 14,000 km2 occur on the South Slope of the Caucasus Range, where the Lab
Zone is located. At present, there are not active mudflow hearts identified in the region,
however, it should be always considered that there is a potential danger of formation and
development of powerful mudflow processes.
Moreover, the most of rivers of the region upstream have .a mudflow nature. In such
conditions, any change of formed natural physical-geographical balance caused by incorrect
management of forest and pastureland might result in sharp activation of mudflow processes.
Although characteristics of western part of the Caucasus Range such as: existence of dense
vegetation cover, abundant precipitation, well developed cultural soil layer and absence of
drought periods, do not contribute to the formation of powerful mudflows, nevertheless there
are mudflow danger areas and consequently possibility of their activation in the surroundings
of the Rioni and Tskhenistkali Rivers' ravine (mainly within the Lentekhi and Oni districts).
Timber skidding trails, when allowed, need to be protected from lateral and linear erosion
and erosion control measures should be installed to ensure quick diversion of perch water
out of trails.
Soil erosion occurs on the study area, which in most cases causes complete loss of soil layer
and outcropping of base rocks. Considering this fact, forest cut at such sites should be
allowed below the 200 inclination of the slope, and cuts should have selective and seasonal
character. On the slopes with higher inclination, forest cut is not reasonable due to the
danger of formation of erosion and mudflow processes.

National Forests Development Project
The most necessary measures for prevention of forming and further development of soil
erosion, mudflow and landslide processes are as follows:
*   Pasture control, observing terms and periods of the pasturing;
*   Pasture remediation - amelioration by periodic seeding of grass;
*   Construction of lined channels and installation of terraces on the slopes, phyto-
melioration works, re-vegetation of grass and bushes in sub-alpine zone.
These complex measures will minimize activation of already running geodynamic processes
or provoking and further developing of potential hearts of these processes caused by the
forest cuts and road infrastructure.
The following preventive measures complement guidelines provided by forest related legal
basis:
*   Prohibition of any forest cutting on the slopes with inclination a>350;
*   Prohibition of timber skidding trails on the slopes with inclination cX>300;
*   Prohibition of any cuts within the 300 m area of sub-alpine zone;
*   Prohibition of any cuts within 200 m area from active beds of snow avalanches and
mudflows;
*   Prohibition of any cutting within 100 m area from landslides, rock falls, karsts;
*   Prohibition of any cutting in 1 km area around mineral springs;
*   Prohibition of any cutting in stands damaged by erosion within 100 m radius.
Reforestation and biological methods against erosion are urgent around settlements where
degraded forest stands and eroded slopes are frequent. With this regards, it is necessary to
mention the method developed by Georgian specialists, which provides stabilization of
eroded slopes by natural materials (bentonite and zeolite) for further re-cultivation of grass
cover
Hydrogeological aspects related with forest are also very important issue. Namely, not
systemized forest cut could result in failure of natural balance, formed in relation with
perched water, infiltration water, evapotranspiration and groundwater. Destruction of the
vegetation on the slopes causes sharp increase of perched water and relatively significant
reduction of infiltration and groundwater, together with disappearance of evapotranspiration.
As a result, decrease of groundwater level may cause impoverishment and ceasing of wells
used by local population for water supply purposes.
Activation/development of gravitational processes, especially landslides due to the above-
mentioned reasons is obvious. Due to the reduction of evapotranspiration rate practically to
the zero, whole mass of infiltrated water accumulates within elluvial-talus and colluvial cover.
Thickness of the cover, represented by plastic clays and loams, on slopes frequently is more
than 10 m. Due to saturation of eluvial-talus and colluvial sediments, slope becomes heavier.
Volume weight of the ground as well as tension of displacement sharply increases. At the
same time, the friction angle (a°) and specific friction (C) is reduced unevenly, which
inevitable cause distortion of natural balance and sliding of the slope.
Unfortunately, there are many examples of improper forest management that have rather
negative impacts on the forest and environment. Intensive cuttings might weaken anti-

erosion - hydrological and soil protective functions. All above-mentioned issues stipulate
necessity of selective cuttings together with forest regeneration activities.
In conditions of complicated, intensively folded relief and development of dangerous
geodynamic processes, which take place all over the study area, it is very important to select
correctly infrastructure of roads, skidding trails, etc. Otherwise, sharp activation of existing
geological processes - rock falls, landslides, etc. is inevitable. Engineering-geological
conditions of the region have decisive impact on secondary and main road infrastructure,
according to which road could be constructed with so-called "zero works", embankments,
semi-embankments, grooves, etc. On steep slopes and declivity, road construction is carried
out by different combinations of embankments and grooves, which is accompanied with huge
earthworks and sometimes explosions.
Road construction works in the areas with landslide danger, close to the avalanches and
mudflow beds bear great negative environment risk. Conditions are worsened when
seismicity of the territory is high that actually takes place on the whole study area. In order to
ensure stability of road in such areas, it is necessary to carry out large and expensive
engineering works. Due to this fact it is more expedient to avoid construction of roads on
sensitive places and construct them on more stable areas.
At the slopes with relatively small (x<200) inclination (Ambrolauri district, partly Oni and
Tsageri districts) quite thick (h>O10m) Quaternary eluvial-talus and colluvial grounds are
developed. These areas are weakly drained. In these conditions, groove made during the
road construction is located within soft coherent and incoherent grounds, which could
represent also a basis for embankment. Cutting of slopes in this case can cause significant
landslides. Situation is worsened due to high humidity of slope grounds (due to the weak
natural drainage) and dynamic load of transport on the slope.
Therefore, before constructing grooves and embankments, assessment and prognosis of
slope stability should be carried out. This issue is vital for slopes with inclination more than
250. Stability assessment is carried out mainly according to the scheme of consequent
landslide or for the circular-cylinder form of sliding surface. Rate of the embankment stability
is determined by value of stability coefficient (rl), which is:
N tg q + c L
T
N        normal constituent of gravitational force, which tries to keep balance of the embankment
T        constituent of gravitational force, which works on displacement-sliding of the embankment
L        length of the sliding surface
c and (p  indexes of resistance on displacement
It is important to assess stability of embankments and grooves constructed on the karstic
rocks, since they are frequently found on the study area (Ambrolauri and Tsageri districts). In
this case, qualitative assessment of the road, which is based on the study of karst forms
revealed on the surface and degree of karstation, is enough.
Above-mentioned indicates on the necessity to carry out geological and environmental
assessment and prognosis on road infrastructure before start of any forest utilization
activities to avoid further complications during road construction and exploitation.

Background
Around 2.75 million ha of Georgia's territory (39.6% of total surface) is covered by forests.
The total standing volume reaches 434 million m3 and annual growth is about 4 million m3.
The forest ecosystems are characterized with complex of soil, water, air and unique flora and
fauna species.
The forests are a unique source of biodiversity and a major economic resource. They are
situated mainly on steep mountain slopes, and fulfill an important function in preventing soil
erosion, having a water retaining and water regulating ability. They provide habitats for many
rare and endangered plants and animals, many of plants being endemic or glacial relics.
Forests are distributed unevenly in the country, which is caused by complex relief and
variable climate on Georgia's territory. Together with forested territories, areas with less then
10% of forestation could be found.
Differences of climate conditions between the East and West Georgia determine differences
in the vegetation.
Distribution of forest according to altitude

19.8%                                   above 2,001 m
The majority of forests are situated mainly on steep mountain slopes. Forest distribution
according to the inclination of slope is the following:

During the soviet time, Georgia imported most of its wood resources from Russia, keeping its
own forest resources mostly untouched. Most of Georgia's forests are still categorized as
protected and most harvesting is therefore illegal. Illegal harvesting, mainly for local
consumption as firewood, takes place, which is for the most part out of the control of the
SDFM. Low prices on timber cause and condition its exportation from Georgia. At present,
due to the economical situation in Georgia, import of timber in the medium term will be rather
difficult due to the high price of this resource in world markets. Therefore, a policy should be
created to meet a rising demand for timber in the domestic economy and for export of local
wood products to other markets with proper preservation of ecological, social, protective and
other functions of the forests.
The Strategy for Development of the Forestry in Georgia has been worked out with support
of the World Bank in order to preserve and to ensure sustainable management of the fragile
biodiversity and ecological balance of the mountain forests. The Strategy identified
institutional changes and major investment projects for promotion of sustainable
development of the forestry economy in the transition period. The Strategy states that the
forest management system, which was created in the period of central planning, does not
meet the actual needs of the forestry.
Description of Laboratory Zone
The Forests Development Project (FDP) aims to work out the basis for sustainable and
rational forestry management. With this regard, a "Laboratory Zone" was selected in the
Central Caucasus region as pilot zone for the development of sustainable forest
management.
The Laboratory Zone of the region comprises four medium and high mountainous
administrative regions, namely: Lentekhi, Tsageri, Oni and Ambrolauri. The total area makes
up to 462,000 ha.
The forests of the Laboratory Zone are managed by the State Department of Forest
Management and its regional offices in Lentekhi, Tsageri, Oni and Ambrolauri.
The part of the forests owned by the former collective farms and state farms have been
transferred to the State Department of Forest Management (2,839 ha in Lentekhi, 111,02 ha
in Tsageri, 18,631 ha in Oni, 307,13 ha in Ambrolauri).
276,000 ha of the Forest Fund are located within the Laboratory Zone. The territory of
259,000 ha out of this area is covered with mountain forests.
Other categories of the Forest Fund's land are represented by:
Low density stands and glades                     4,000 ha
Hay mowing areas and pastures                     4,000 ha
Rocks and landslides                               8,000 ha
Roads                                               100 ha
The remaining territory with a total area of 900 ha is occupied by rivers, lakes, etc.

A. Fed are artificially planted in Laboratory Zone having the area of 2,400 ha.
Normative acts on creation of plantation for timber production have not been applied.
Georgia's experience in this field is related solely to Junglas plantations.
During the last decade, due to financial restrictions, the restoration of the forest has not been
practiced and the process of restoration takes places mainly naturally. Taking into account
environmental conditions of cut areas, the regeneration with relevant species proceed
satisfactorily. It should be mentioned, that natural restoration occurs only in the areas where
cattle grazing does not take place. Monitoring of natural restoration, as well as pastures, is
not carried out. An intensive cattle grazing is practiced within 2 km radius from the populated
areas. These places constitute 10% of the entire forest fund i.e. 30,000 ha of the study
territory. Separate grazing areas are assigned and allocated by relevant laws and
regulations. According to which, there must be 'corridors' for cattle to bring them from the
settlements to the grazing areas. Although, communities have grazing lands allocated, locals
reserve these lands to grow grass to have hay for cattle in wintertime. Certainly, all this is
caused by poverty. Solution could be to make cattle feed more easily available for the local
population. There is no need to change relavant regulations.
In spite of existence of the Forest Code and normative acts regulating main, sanitary,
maintenance and other types of forest use, exploitative commercial cuts, justified as sanitary
cuts, are carried out in the sensitive parts of the Laboratory Zone. These activities lead to the
degradation of endemic and relic vegetation of the region.

There are no parameters, criteria and normative acts in Georgia, which could assign intact
(virgin) statues to the forests. If the territories, which are inaccessible, uncut and distant from
the populated area, are included in the virgin forest category, then untouched area in the Lab
Zone will amount to approximately 30,000 ha.
The annual cuts are planned according to the forest inventory data, based on the existing
normative acts and considering continuous utilization of the forest. Table 2.3.3 shows data
on annual cuts in the Laboratory Zone.

The normative acts related to the forest cutting are created considering state of the forest
ecosystem (productivity, species, density, slope, soil condition, renewal, etc.). The main
violation, which takes place in the process of forest cutting, is removal of the best trees and
young growth.
Foresters having university degree determine cutting area and the trees to be cut. The
cutting area is divided into several parts according to the types of cuttings to be
accomplished. All trees of the cutting area that should be removed are marked by specialists.
Cutting is performed by the organizations, which succeeded to obtain this right on the basis
of tender. The personnel of these organizations have practical experience, but do not have
education in the field of ecology and environmental sciences. The specialists and workers
involved in forest exploitation have no monetary incentives to conduct their activities in
compliance with normative acts on forest exploitation.
According to the normative acts, people intending to process timber in the cutting area are
required to prepare a technical plan for utilization of cutting area prior to commencement of
their activities. The technical plan is a document showing planned exploitation scheme,
characteristics, technical advice and quantitative indexes related to the cutting area. The
map is created considering all features of the cutting area such as: area; relief; soil; forms;
type of cutting and logging; ways of cleaning the cutting area; location of upper storehouse;
loading place; structure of the transportation roads; main and supplementary logging paths;
arrangement of skyway facilities; security zones; requirements on natural restoration,
protection against erosion and preservation of young growth at the cutting area.
Forest is cut with chain saws such as "Ural" and 'Druzhba". Crown is cleaned and arranged
according to assortments on the cutting site. Transportation from the cutting site to the main
road is done with tractors, after which special trucks deliver the timber to the destination
place.
After termination of cutting activities in the mountain forests, the mineralized surface area
(including the logging trails, loading and other areas) should not exceed 15% of total cutting
area. The width of skyways should exceed 15 m, while that of a logging tractor road should
be 2 m wider than the width of the logging tractor. In order to maintain young growth and
threes not assigned for cutting, it is allowed to build winding (zigzag) logging roads. It is also

ACTA Consultants                                          Sectoral Environmental Assessment

possible to widen the road where the turn is very sharp. If inclination of a slope is above 31-
350, timber should be transported with skyways. Normative acts do not provide any other
criteria regarding the forest roads. The road in the forest is mainly made by means of tractors
and explosion of rocky areas.
Timber producers are obligated to respect relevant standards on construction of logging trails
and timber transporting road to avoid development of erosive processes. One of the main
causes of erosion is logging, since logging, as well as skidding follows the slope inclination.
Since skyway equipment for timber transportation actually does not exist, at least 50% of soil
layer in the cutting area is damaged by logging. This fact causes erosion in the areas where
slope grade is equal to or is more than 250.
The total length of roads in the laboratory zone is 750 km, which is 2,7 km per 1,000 ha. This
is a very low index for carrying out an intensive farming and forestry.
According to the requirements of normative acts, forest located on the steep slopes is
selectively cut only in those places where slope inclination is less than 35°. In order to carry
out cuttings, it is necessary to have a sufficient level of natural regeneration. Intensiveness of
cutting depends on slope inclination, exposition, existing species and their density. Cutting
amount varies form 10 to 25% of entire standing volume.
According to the requirements of normative acts, timber producer is obliged to clean the
cutting area. They are requested to pile the waste materials to let it decay. Piles should be
located along the logging trails to reinforce them or in the areas free from the young growth.
The waste materials, which are piled to decay, should be firmly placed on the ground in order
to avoid development of forest parasites.
Practically, the requirements of the normative acts regarding the cutting site clearance are
not respected. The cutting areas are blocked with waste materials, monitoring of these sites
is not carried out. The notion of control and environmental audit of cutting areas is not
included in the Forest Code. However, it is planned to introduce this practice, and nowadays,
there are works started in this direction.
Annulment of ban on timber export in 2000, made forest-cutting activities profitable, and in
some cases, the only possibility of income. High quality Fagus timber, are main subject to
export. The most important violations, which take place during the process of forest cutting
are: cutting of highly valuable trees; intensive cutting along the roads; damaging the young
growth; increasing risk of blocking and consequent deterioration of phytosanitary conditions
of the forest. In some cases, cutting is carried out is such places where conditions of the
stands do not satisfy the cutting rule requirements.
Above mentioned violations cause forest degradation and deterioration of its sanitary
conditions. Due to above mentioned processes, the area of ecologically unbalanced territory
is being increased.
According to the existing legislation, the State Forest Fund Registry System consists of forest
fund monitoring, cadastre and forest management.
Forest management is carried out based on the forest inventory materials and management
projects (made by Lesoproject) specifying activities to be undertaken. Due to the fact that the
normative basis (Forest Code, cutting rules, maturity age of cutting, etc.) has been
considerably changed during the last few years, and that the management projects were
developed in the period when regulations were quite different, caused that the management
projects does not meet the actual standards and needs of the forestry and practical
application of the forest management projects (plans) became difficult.

Forest inventory is conducted once in ten years. Forest inventory materials include inventory
and cartographic materials, as well as planning materials related to the forest maintenance,
protection, restoration and utilization activities based on the existing normative acts.
Normative act on the State Forest Fund Registry System, determining goals and functions of
forest management and cadastre, is now being elaborated. Due to the absence of finances,
forest management and monitoring activities are not regularly conducted. The goals and
purposes of forest cadastre are not clearly defined.
The Ministry of Environment is now working on the normative act, which will regulate final
cuttings of the areas covered with forest and their usage in agriculture.
Final cutting is not permitted in the protected forests. In these places, only thinning and
sanitary cuttings are practiced. However, in some cases, during the sanitary cutting, healthy
and "the best" trees are removed instead of damaged and diseased ones.
In order to avoid erosion the normative acts prohibit the following activities:
*    cutting on the slopes where inclination is more than 350;
*    logging on the slopes where inclination is more than 300;
*    damaging more than 15% of upper soil layer of entire cutting area.
The monitoring of eroded areas and their development is not carried out.
The normative acts allow usage of pesticides and herbicides. However, their list and
parameters, which should have been approved by the Ministry of Environment, do not exist.
Practically, no pesticides and herbicides are applied in the study region.
Limits and prohibitions connected to the different types of oil products and their accidental
spills are not specified by the normative acts. Although these events take place, they are not
registered.
Saw mills are located in the suburbs of settlements. There are no normative acts related to
the sawing activities. As sawdust is not utilized, it is piled to decay. At present, timber is not
treated with chemicals.
Due to the current economic crisis and unemployment, about 40% of the local population is
involved in the forest business, which is mainly based on illegal cuts and corruption. The
local population practically has no legally generated profit from the forest utilization.
The breakdown of forest utilization by locals largely depends on the region, existing
conditions, season, demand, etc. The forest utilization by locals could be broken in the
following way:
Own consumption                             25%
Utilization upon demand                     10%
Commercial purposes                         5%
In order to clearly define the use of forest by locals needs separate detailed study.
According to the existing normative acts, the public and NGOs have the right to obtain
objective and timely information on the condition of the State Forest Fund and to participate

in all activities of planning stages of the state forest fund management. However, the local
population practically is not involved in the process of forest management.
Usage of non-wood resources of the State Forest Fund is implemented on the basis of forest
resources evaluated through special research and forest management materials. Currently,
the Ministry of Environment is elaborating "The rule on usage of non-wood resources of the
State Forest Fund" and relevant normative acts.
Actually, local population can exploit non-wood resources for their personal needs without
any limit.
Approximate amount of annual non-wood resources consists of:
Type of plants                              Amounts (tons)
Different species of fungi                       30

There are various indigenous plants and their wild ancestors in the Laboratory Zone. These
are: grains such as Tritcum vulgare Viil. var. erythrospermum Korn, Triticum aestivum L.,
Triticum durum Desf., Triticum monococcum L., Triticum tuba/icum Dek., etc.; different
species of grapes such as Tsolikauri, Alexandrouli etc.; some species of apples such as
Tusharauli, Kitra vashli, Abilauri, etc.; pears such as Sheura, Mepis mskhali, Guishava,
Taphlamskala, etc.; and naciferous; plants such as Junglans, Castanea, Corylus, etc.
Orchards create small groups of trees, which protect soil and regulate water flow. These are
the buffer zones between villages and forest, protecting the former from landslides and
erosion.  These facts should be considered in the processes of elaborating biologic
restoration methods for eroded and landslide areas and reconstruction of degraded forests
adjacent to villages.
Population of the Lab Zone use different species of edible plants like Convolvulus arvelis L.,
Qalshava, Polygonatum P. glaberimum C. Koch, Rumex patientia L., Urtica urens L.., etc.;
and fungi such as Armillariella mellea Karst, Amanita caesaria Pers. et Schw., Agaricus
campester Fr., Lactarius deliciosus Fr., and Lactarius piperatus Fr.
Wild fruits of the region are represented by Comus mas L., Mespilus germania L., Crataegus,
Cerasus silvestris Garsault, Prunus divaricata Ldb, Diospyros, Pyrus caucasica, Malus
orientalis Uglitz, Rubus, Rosa canina L, Viccinium myrtillus L, Hippohae rhamnoides L,

The territory of the region has significant historic cultural heritage. There are many medieval
and ancient churches and castles, a number of which is ruined. Historic archeological
monuments, widely spread in the region, give exceptional splendor to the environment and

c)  construct farming and other temporary facilities for special purposes for exercising
his/her right to use forest resources (based on the agreement with relevant authorities
of the forest management);
d) utilize forest roads and other infrastructure while exercising his/her right to use forest
resources;
e)  participate in activities related to forest maintenance, protection, restoration and
renewal;
f)  own, use and manage the resources obtained from forest utilization; and
g) get acquainted with rules of forest usage.
Forest sector salaries are at the same level as other civil salaries. The Georgian legislation
defines minimum and maximum salaries for staff of State institutions. It ranges between 150
GEL (75 USD) and 15 GEL (7.5 USD). The average salary of forest farming employee is
equivalent of 25 USD in GEL. The salaries are financed from the State Budget and do not
change according to the extent of work. The payment of salaries is often delayed for several
months or sometimes years.

2.4  Biodiversity
Georgia is one of the interesting countries in terms of biodiversity. Almost 40% of the territory
is forested. Only 59,500 ha is classified as "artificial" forests; 5% of the natural cover is
represented by so-called "aged, virgin forests" which are not exploited; 40% still preserve its
initial structure. Along with their significance to biodiversity, the forests of Georgia are
important in the context of global climate changes.
It is quite difficult to draw a clear line between floristic and faunistic regions represented in
the Caucasus due to the mutual penetration of species (see Figures 11,12 and 13).
Considering biodiversity, the Caucasus is characterized by its complex, sometimes mosaic
spatial structure of biological communities representing different biogeographic zones. The
outlining of the optimal way for protection of the biodiversity requires special attention to this
problem, as the most important feature of it is the permanent interaction of the local, West-
Asian and East-European communities, which deeply influenced the genetic structure of
Caucasian populations of animals and plants and the physiognomy of the biological
communities.
The territory of Georgia is the most diverse of all Caucasian countries regarding its climate
and landscape. It covers almost all biogeographic regions represented throughout the
Caucasus Isthmus as well as a "mixed" zone with communities of diverse origin, including
representatives of different floras and faunas. Georgia extends over the Caucasian mountain
systems, the southern slopes of the Great Caucasus and the northern part of the Lesser
Caucasus. At the same time, all types of Caucasian landscapes are represented: in the
western part of the country there are humid subtropical landscapes in which autochtonous
Caucasian (or Kolkhetian) fauna and flora prevail; alpine landscapes with plenty of East-
European elements dominate in the northern and north-eastern parts; the typical Middle East
treeless uplands form the characteristic landscape of southern Georgia, and in the south-
east, semi-deserts and deserts of Turanian type are predominant (Badridze, Bukhnikashvili,
1996).
The following biogeographical districts are represented in Georgia:
1.   Kolkheti District covers most of the area of western Georgia;
2.   Caucasian or Kavkasioni District covers the uplands of the Great Caucasus (usually
2,000 m and higher);
3.   mountain plateaus of the Lesser Caucasus cover about one-tenth of Georgia's
territory;
4.   Mtkvari (Kura) district covers a comparatively small part of Georgia's territory in the
south-east (the lori uplands and Lower Kartli).
The relief creates relatively clear boundaries between different biogeographic districts.
However, these boundaries remain conditional. Kolkhetian elements are found along the
southern slopes of the Great Caucasus up to the eastern border of Georgia. As a result of
such mutual penetration of elements, a significant part of the country is taken up by
communities of mixed origin, which cannot be unified in any of the listed districts and sub-
regions.
Thus, according to the geographic position of Georgia, four biogeographic districts are
represented throughout the country's territory, as well as at least three zones of mixed origin.

Numbers of Species and Levels of Endemism
Plants
Flora is very diverse and comprises around 4,100 species of vascular plants, 675 mosses,
1,763 algae, more than 7,000 fungi, 738 lichens. Out of all the vascular species distributed in
Georgia 380 (9.0%) are endemic of country and 600 (14.2%) - endemic of the Caucasus.
The endemics can be roughly divided into 2 categories:
1)  local endemics, and
2)  endemics distributed throughout many provinces.
The first type is represented by such species as Campanula mirabilis, Hypericum
thethrobicum; the second category consists of such species as Senecio rhombifolius
(endemic of the Caucasus, found almost everywhere throughout Georgia). It is worth
mentioning that both Georgian and Caucasian endemics are connected with different plant
communities such as - peat bog soenoses (Solidago turfosa), Kolkhetian forests (Epigaea
gaultherioides), sub-alpine megaphorbias (Heracleum sommieri), alpine communities
(Rhododendron caucasicum), subnival coenoses (Delphinium caucasicum) (Badridze,
Bukhnikashvili, 1996).
Vertical zones are strongly pronounced in the vegetation cover on the territory of the country
and are related to the change of natural conditions according to altitude.
Animals
Fauna is very diverse and includes species with different categories of endemism - from
strictly endemics to species, which are quite common all over the world. However, the
geographical position of Georgia even enables species whose range of distribution is very
limited (i.e. Kolkhetian endems) to spread over neighboring countries as well. Considering
this situation, the following categories of endemism can be outlined:
(0)  endems of Georgia sensu stricto (however most taxa, whether of animals or plants,
do not include such forms except for very few ones);
(1a) endems of the Caucasus Isthmus (plus northern slopes of Lazistan and Ponto ridges
which represent the Kolkhetian-type ecosystems); at least half of their ranges are
situated in Georgia;
(1 b) endems of the Caucasus; less than half of their ranges is situated in Georgia;
(2)  endems of South-Westem Asia;
(3) East-Mediterranean species (South-Western Asia, South-East Europe and North-
East Africa);
(4)  widespread species. Well-known groups of animals are presented in this category.
With not so well known animals, the division is less distinct (Badridze, Bukhnikashvili,
1996).
Fishes: Practically all information on this group is outdated. According to the information of
1970, the percentage of Caucasus endems reaches 23%. From the obviously endemic
Georgian or mostly Georgian species group the following ones are worth mentioning:
Leucisus borysthenicus, Alosa caspia, Chondrostoma kolkhicum, Variocorhinus sieboldi,
Barbus mursa, Albumus filippi, Albumus charusini, Nemachilus angorae.

National Forests Development Project
Amphibians: Caucasian endems are 23% of the total number of species. The species of
category (1a) are: Mertensiella caucasica, Pelodytes caucasicus, Bufo verrucosissimus,
hybrid zones of the Rana macrocnemis complex and Hyla arborea complex.
Reptiles: Endems of the Caucasus in this group are approximately 25%. The species of
category (la) are: Lizards of Archaeolacerta species group: Lacerta rudis, L. derugini, L.
parvula, L. mixta; Gartersnake Natrix megalocephala; Viper of Vipera (Pelias) kaznakovi
complex. Probably, hybrid zones of the Archaeolacerta group lizards (at least 10 species)
and vipers of Pelias group belong to this group too.
Birds: There are two galliform species in this group - Lyrurus mlokosiewiczi and Tetraogallus
caucasicus. Caucasus endems represent 0.08% of avian fauna. An isolated geographical
population of alpine finch, Carpodacus rubicilla, is noticeable (the main population inhabits
the mountains of Central Asia).
Mammals: The following species of categories (0) and (1) belong to this group: shrew Sorex
raddei (1b), S. caucasica (1b), S. volnuchini (1b), Neomys schelkownikowi (1b), Talpa
caucasica (la), Sicista caucasica (lb), S. kazbegica (lb-la), S. kluchorica (lb-la), S.
armenica (1b), Prometheomys schaposchnikowi (la), Mesocricetus brandti (1a), M. raddei
(lb), Terricola daghestanicus (lb), T. nasarovi (lb), Apodemus (S.) fulvipectus (lb), A. (S.)
ponticus (lb); there are also contact and/or hybrid zones of Apodemus species and Mus
musculus groups, as well as Capra caucasica group (Caucasian goats - both (1 b)).
Caucasian endems represent 15.8% of Georgia's teriofauna (Badridze, Bukhnikashvili,
1996).
Threats to Flora and Fauna
In general, reasons for the extinction and/or decline of plant and animal populations can be
divided into two main large groups with several categories:
I.  Direct causes, including hunting, fishing, catching, grazing, etc.
II. Indirect causes, which can be divided into the following sub-categories:
(a)   destruction of natural habitats;
(b)   fragmentation of habitats;
(c)   invasion of introduced plant/animal species;
(d)   pollution,
(e)   global reasons, including anthropogenic, climatic changes, and
(f)   inbreeding.
Main reasons for the extinction of plant and animal population are: destruction and
fragmentation of natural habitats (urbanization, increase of agricultural land, modification of
lakes, building of new reservoirs), cutting of forests, due to the energy problems in the
country, and poaching. Although, legislation on the protection of biodiversity is already
adopted by the government of the country, it needs further refinement since the legislation
lacks provisions which hampers its actual work. Environmental awareness of people is rather
low and causes extinction of many species of plants and animals.
In order to protect biodiversity, Georgia ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity (Rio de
Janeiro, 1992), Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as a
Waterfowl Habitat (Ramsar, 1971) and Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES, Washington, 1973), which formed a basis for

broadening intemational co-operation and expanding activities in the field of the preservation
of biodiversity.
Together with the development of protected areas, there are the following priority directions
in the field of biodiversity:
. conservation - e.g. preservation of rare and endangered species in bio-reserves;
creation of genetic fund of wild nature;
* sustainable use of renewable natural resources;
* reproduction - breeding of rare and endangered species and their introduction in the
nature.
These activities are considered in the Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan drafted under the
guidance of the Ministry of Environment with financial support from the GEF.
Biodiversity of the Central Caucasus Region -
Racha and Lechkhumi regions
The mycobiotic diversity of Racha-Lechkhumi
The flora of Racha-Lechkhumi consists of 1,198 species (excluding mosses), out of which:
ferns                                  40
gymnosperms                            7
angiosperms                            1,151
(Gagnidze, Kemularia - Natadze, 1985)
There are 1,089 fungi species in Racha. Among these, the most diverse are Basidiomycota
and Deuteromycota. The distribution of fungi according to the host plant families is as
follows:
Rosaceae                              163

Polygonaceae                          21
Available data (Svanidze, 1984) show that the largest number of fungi species is recorded on
the following plants: Acerpseudoplatanus (5 spp. of fungi), A. trautvetteri (5), Allium cepa (6),
Alnus glutinosa (6), Carpinus orientalis (5), Cucumis sativus (7), Elytrigia repens (6), Ficus
carica (6), Helleborus caucasicus (5), Hordeum sp. (5), Lamium album (5), Lonicera

caucasica (5), Lycopersicum esculentium (6), Mespilus germanica (6), Prunus domestica (6),
Pyrus caucasica (7), Rosa sp. (5), Rumex alpinus (6), Sambucus nigra (6), Solanum
tuberosum (6), Tilia begoniifolia (7), Ulmus glabra (6), Viburnum lantana (5).
The majority (44 species) out of 56 species listed above are trees and bushes.
According to Svanidze (1985), the distribution of fungi species among botanical-geographic
regions is as follows:
1. Highland geo-botanic region of Racha and Lechkhumi Range - 415 species
Sub-region of Lechkhumi Range and Chutkharo-Shusharo     161 species
Gebi sub-region                                           54 species
The massive of Racha Caucasus and Shoda-Kedela           291 species
2. Racha Limestone Range and Racha-Lechkhumi Depression - 769 species
Racha-Lechkhumi Hollow low mountain sub-region           511 species
Nakerala Range sub-region                                129 species
Satsalike-Khokhata-Leknari subregion                     301 species
Shkmeri sub-region                                        72 species
Macromycetes are very important for forest ecosystems, all of them belong to Basidiomycota
- 200 species. Their distribution in altitudinal zones is as follows:
Mixed forests                                            136 species
Deciduous forests                                        144 species
Dark coniferous forests                                  146 species
Sub-alpine forests                                        22 species
Alpine zone                                                5 species
Aphillophorous fungi inhabit on both live and dead trees, dry and fallen trees and branches.
Many of them are pathogenic and cause withering of trees, rotting of rind. Other species are
important agents causing cellulose and lignin decomposition and they play an important role

Lignophiles inhabit necrotic tissues of live trees, dry and fallen trees, logs, branches, and
leaves. Lignophiles are divided into 3 groups depending on substratum they use
(Nakhutsrishvili, 1975). The species of these groups in Racha-Lechkhumi forest coenoses
are as follows:
1. Fungi growing on the timber of deciduous species: Armillariella tabascens,
Crepidotus mollis, Kuehneromyces mutabilis, Mycena supina, Panus rudis, Pholiota
aurivela, Polyporus alveolarius, P. arcularius, P. brumalis, P. forquignonii, P. varius,
Psathyrella candoleana, Volvariella bombycina.
2. Fungi growing on coniferous plants: Lentinus lepideus, Mycena resella, Paxillus
atrotomentosus, Pholiota aurivella van. abies-nordmanniana, Tricholomopsis rutilans.
3. Species that occur on deciduous and coniferous plants: Armillaria mellea, Corpinus
atramentarius, C. domesticus, C. micaceus, Crepidotus applanatus, Flammulina
velutipes, Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca, Hypholoma fasciculare, H. sublateritium,

Marasmius, Mycena, Rhodophyllus, Tricholoma (Nakhutsrishvili, 1975).
Humus saprophytes are found both in forests and open barren areas where grass does not
grow. These are almost all species of the following genera: Agaricus, Hygrocybe, Inocybe,
Macrolepiota. In particular: Agaricus arvensis, A. campestre, A. silvaticus, Hygrocybe conica,
Inocybe patouillardi, Macrolepiota procera etc. Marasmus oreades grows by forests edges,
on pastures, in meadows - up to sub-nival zone (Nakhutsrishvili, 1975).
Coprophiles are: Agaricus campestris, Anellaria semiovata, Corpinus comatus, C.
ephemerus, Panaeolus papilionaceus.
Briophiles grow between and on mosses and include Fayodia maura, Mycena supina, M.
vulgaris.
Edible and poisonous fungi:
A total of 70 species of edible fungi have been recorded in Racha-Lechkhumi. The number of
potentially poisonous and poisonous species is probably the same as in Svaneti
(approximately 30). As mentioned above, the content of species of edible and poisonous
fungi does not differ greatly in Svaneti and Racha-Lechkhumi.
Fungi of cultural and economically important wild plants
According to T. Svanidze, more than 600 fungi species are found on cultural and
economically important wild plants of Racha. Out of these, 280 species are found on cultural

plants. In terms of the spectrum of phytopatogenic fungi, their significance and control, in
Racha the situation is similar to that in Svaneti.
Botanical-geographic features
According to the botanical-geographic and floristic peculiarities, Racha-Lechkhumi is divided
into two major phytoborionomic districts. Its highland part belongs to the Svaneti-Racha
Caucasus District, whereas its middle-height limestone part belongs to the Racha-Lechkhumi
and Imereti limestone District.
Habitat description
Botanically Racha belongs to Colchic (Kolkhetian) floristic province. Due to its mountainous
relief, several vertical zones are developed:
1.  400-2,300 m - different types of forests, mainly deciduous and mixed, with evergreen
bushes.
2.  800-900 m - dark coniferous (spruce, fir) forests which may expand up to 2,300 m
with secondary oak, pine and Populus hybrida forests. In some gorges, dark
coniferous zone is replaced by deciduous.
3.  1,800 (2,000) - 2,350 (2,600) m - sub-alpine forests, tall grasslands, sub-alpine
bushes and meadows.
4.  2,350 (2,500) - 2,900 (3,150) m - alpine zone.
5. 2,900 (3,150) - 3,100 (3,300) m - sub-nival and nival zones.
Racha generally is rich in fir (Abies Nordmanniana) and beech (Fagus orientalis) forests.
Racha-Lechkhumi is divided into several botanical-geographic regions according to diversity
of ecosystems and floristic variety. They are represented by floristic complexes, whose
formation largely depended on the physical environment and history of relief formation.
Highland botanical-geographic region of Racha and Lechkhumi Range
As it was mentioned above, the region has the Colchic type of vertical zoning of plants, with
its characteristic formations: deciduous, dark conifers, sub-alpine light and crooked-stem
forest (birch, Acer campestre, Fagus orientalis), tall grasslands, mezophilous mixed grass
meadows. In the alpine zone, there are formations of the endemic species Genista suanica
(Notsarula Gorge, m. Shusharo). There are also groups of mixed grass with rare Cirusium
bushiorum and Delphinium izonorum (Bubistskai, Geske). Endemic Paeonia steveniana and
Symphytum ibericum are found in the dark coniferous zone.
The alpine and sub-nival zones are rich, containing ultrareophytes or highland species:
Symphyoloma (S. graveolens), Aetheopappus caucasicus, Deiphium caucasicum, Petasites
fominii, Saxifraga kusnecowiana, Silene marcowiczii, Euphorbia kemulariae.
Three sub-regions are distinguished within the region:
(1) The sub-region of the Lechkhumi Range and Chutkharo-Shusharo Massif;
(2) Gebi sub-region;
(3) The sub-region of the Racha Caucasus and Shoda-kedela.

Calciphilous complexes are dominated by Colchic and Caucasian species. This fact indicates
their ancient origin.
Svaneti Region
Since the Lentekhi region is a part of the Kvemo Svaneti and thus, part of the Svaneti region,
it is worth mentioning floristic and faunistic characteristics of the Svaneti region as a whole.
Habitat description
Svaneti belongs to the floristic province of Kolkheti. Due to mountainous relief, it has vertical
zoning of Kolkheti type. The following zones are represented on its territory:
*    Up to 2,300 m is forest zone, with different versions of mixed and deciduous
forests.
*    From  800-900 m dark coniferous forests (spruce, fir, pine) are found, with
secondary pine and poplar forests.
*    From 1,900-2,350 to 2,000-2,600 m there are sub-alpine forests, meadows and
bushes.
    From 2,350-2,500 to 2,900-3,150 m there is alpine zone with vegetation developed
on post-avalanche and sandy soils.
The mycobiotic diversity of Svaneti
Fungi of the region
According to R. Gagnidze et al (1985) there are 1,100 vascular plant species recorded in
Svaneti. In 1975-80, the Department of Lower Plants of the Institute of Botany listed 2,010
lower species in the Mestia, Lentekhi and Tsageri districts, including:
fungi                                  800
lichens                                245
algae                                  615
mosses                                 350
(Kanchaveli et al, 1985).
Macromycetes in forest ecosystems
The main characteristic components of forest ecosystems are macromycetes, which
participate in mycorrhizas, cause diseases of trees and bushes, or are saprotrophs feeding
on dead matter.
Oak forests: According to Gulmagarashvili et al, (1977); Nakhutsrishvili, (1975, 1981), some
macromycetes are especially abundant and even form aspects in certain places e.g.
Chrepidotus mollis, Actarius piperatus, Annelus stipticus, Leurotus ostreatus, Russula lepida.
Fir and spruce forests: The species widespread in these forests are: Agaricus campestris,
Anellaria semiovata, Hygrocybe conica, Marasmius oreades etc. Species of Gasteromycetes
are: Bovista nigrescens, Calvatia caelata, Langermania gigantea etc. (Kanchaveli et al, I.c.).

National Forests Development Project
Edible and poisonous fungi: There are 80 species of edible fungi and 30 poisonous or
potentially poisonous fungi in Svaneti (Kanchaveli, 1985). Locals collect some species
including: Amanita caesarea, Lactarius deliciosus, L. piperatus, cantharelus cibarius,
Pleurotus ostreatus, Armillaria mellea etc.
Fungi of cultural and wild plants of economical importance: More than 300 fungi species of
cultural and wild plants of economic value are recorded in Svaneti. These include the fungi of
fruit-trees, vine, potato, other vegetables, meadow plants, forest-trees etc.
Botanical-geographical features
Diversity of the relief and climatic factors condition the diversity of habitats. Separate
orographic units and river basins are characterized by different type of Kolkheti vertical
zoning depending on climatic factors, orography and the history of the territories.
According to the vertical distribution of vegetation, Svaneti region can be divided into
different botanical-geographical districts. The division is based also on floristic criteria, and
the links between ecosystems and terrain of different forms.
The following botanical-geographic regions are distinguished in Svaneti (Gagnidze et al,
1985).
1. Nenskra-Nakri Catchment
2. Dolra Catchment
3. Mestia-Chala-Gulkhuri catchmnet
4. Hadish-Enguri and Upper Tskhenistskali catchments
5. Tkhvish-Khumpreri catchments
6. Svaneti Range botanical-geographic region
7. Upper Tskhenistskali and Kheledul-Laskadura catchments
Taxonomic diversity of the flora
1,100 vascular species are recorded in Svaneti (Gagnidze et al, 1985) including: 10 families
of ferns with 20 genera and 30 species; 89 families of angiosperms with 416 genera and
1,062 species (of these 17 families, 86 genera and 194 species are of monocotyledons and
72 families, 329 genera and 866 species of dicotyledons.
Dicotyledons are most numerous (typically 10-15 leading families are taken into account,
which represent 75% of species found in the study area). Families Scrophulaziacae,
Leguminosae, cazyophyllacae, Cruziferae, Umbeliferae, Labiatae are characteristic of
different geo-botanical provinces of Georgia.
From monocotyledons, Gramineae and Liliaceae are most common. Gramineae species are
dominant in meadow ecosystems. The Liliaceae family contains many bulbous plants. Many
of them are rare and are included in the Red Data Book (representatives of Galanthus, Scilla,
Fritillaria, Lilium, Muscari, Eruthroniemne)
The taxonomic diversity of Svaneti flora according to genera is as follows:
The most widespread genera are: Carex, Tlieracium, Cirsium, Veronica etc. Urethrum and
Chentaurea create aspects of meadow ecosystems. The genera Aethacapappus and

Surinella contain rare lithophytous species and belong to the flora of rock piles. Emulariella is
endemic. Other important genera are: Heracleum, Agasyleis, Trifolium, Vecia, Tathyrus, etc.
Ecosystems of mixed grass consist of: 18 species of the genus Veronica of Scrophulariacae,
represented by several endemic and rare species found in the alpine and sub-nival zones of
protected areas.
There are 15 species of Ranukulus of Ranukulaceae family, 12 species of Cerastium of
Caryphyllaceae family, 12 species of Saxifraga of Saxifragae family, etc.
Although the families Rosacae (16), Cruciferae (50) and Labiatae (32) are rich in species,
their role is limited in Svaneti ecosystems. Floristically important genera are: Draba, Rosa,
Scutelaria, Alyssoides (Visicaria), Pseudovesicularia (endemic to the Caucasus),
Coluteocarpus (from Asia Minor).
Campanulacea family is represented by rare, floristically interesting species, needing
protection. The most important genera of sub-alpine and alpine meadow ecosystems are
Geranium and Aichemilla, those of forest ecosystems are Vaccinium, Rhododendron,
Sorbus, Ulex, Fragis, Carpinus, Casta-salix, Populus. The following genera of Gramineae are
most widespread: Poa, Hordeum, Ca/amagrostis, Bromus, Festuca, Colpodium. Lilium is
mostly characteristic of sub-alpine meadows with tall grass.

Protected Areas
In 1996, the Parliament adopted a Law "On Protected Areas System". The Law determines the
following categories for Protected Areas: State Nature Reserve, National Park with different
zones, Nature Monument, Managed Nature Reserve, Protected Landscape, and Multiple Use
Protected Area. According to this Law, Georgia is admissible for the existence of protected
areas included in international network - biosphere reserve, world heritage unit, international
importance wetland Protected Areas. The references from the legislation dealing with
categories of protected territories with brief comments are shown below:
Article 4. State Nature Reserve
1. "The State Nature Reserve can be established in order to conserve nature, natural
processes and genetic resources in a dynamic and untouched condition, and to carry out
scientific research, education work, and bio-monitoring" (Zazanashvili, 1997).
The first Natural Reserve in Georgia was founded in 1912 on the southeastern slope of the
Great Caucasus - in the Lagodekhi gorge. Subsequently, the establishment of strict Nature
Reserves became key process in nature conservation activities. According to the Law, only
nature protection work and scientific research are permitted in the existing reserves. Georgia
has fifteen Nature Reserves established under fSU Law and administrated by the State
Department of Protected Areas, Nature Reserves and Hunting Farms. They comprise mostly
forest habitats, and are managed for strict nature conservation objectives. The total area of
Nature Reserves is over 168,800 ha - approximately 2.4%  of the country's territory. Thirteen
relatively large Nature Reserves are included in the general list of National Parks and
Protected Territories, published by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) in 1990.
The list of Nature Reserves is shown below indicating the area, year of establishment, location,
and main objects of protection (see Table 2.4.1):

Zones (265,700 ha), Managed Nature Reserves, State Forests and Hunting Farms, where a
certain protection regime operates (Zazanashvili, 1996). In most cases the status of Protected
Areas does not comply with legislative norms and definitions defined in accordance with
international criteria. This is one of the circumstances creating the importance of the
establishment of a New System of Protected Areas.
The existing reserves do not comply with the requirements enforced upon this category: a
number of care activities in Georgian reserves such as: sanitary cutting, mowing, making
saltcellars for animals, and etc., are allowed. In order to bring the actual situation into
accordance with the legislation, it is necessary to make the protection regime stricter, or revise
the status of nature reserves.
In 1992, State Council approved a plan to protect seven national parks. The Borjomi-
Kharagauli National Park and Kolkheti National Park have already been drawn up and
established.
Article 5. National Park
1. "A National Park is established in order to protect relatively huge and pronounced with
natural beauty ecosystems of international importance, conserve habitats, and carry out
scientific, educational, and recreational activities" (Zazanashvili, 1997).

National Forests Development Project
The following main zones may be arranged in the National Park:
a)   strictly protected zones;
b)   managed reserved zone;
c)   visitors zone;
d)   restoration zone;
e)   historical-cultural zone;
f)   administration zone;
g)   traditional use zone.
A National Park in contrast to a Nature Reserve is multiple use reserved territory. The use of
the tourist-recreation potential of the territory is of greater importance in comparison to
protection and conservation of nature in a National Park.
Article 6. Natural Monument
The category of Natural Monument can be a given waterfall, lake, wood massif, even a tree,
if this kind of small object is unique.
Article 7. Managed Nature Reserve
There are no ecosystem level units in the definition of Managed Nature Reserve. They in
general are established in order to protect separate species of plants and animals, using
essential care and restoration activities.
Article 8. Protected Landscape
Although, there are many unique landscapes in Georgia where natural components and
historical-cultural monuments harmonize with each other, the category of Protected
Landscapes is not established yet in the country.
Article 9. Multiple Use Protected Area
This category of protected areas is often known as "support zones".
Article 10. Biosphere Reserve
Biosphere reserve may consist of the following main zones:
a) strictly nature protected zone;
b) managed nature protected (for manipulations) or buffer zone;
c) restoration zone;
d) traditional-cultural landscape zone.
This category may be given to a territory only after the conclusion of the International
Coordinating Council of UNESCO program - "Man and Biosphere".
Article 11. World Heritage Unit
Like biosphere reserve, the establishment of this category is possible only after the
recognition of UNESCO World Heritage Convention Committee and including in the list of
World Heritage. Only several architectural monuments have the status of World Heritage Unit
in Georgia (Ushguli, Mtskheta) (Zazanashvili, 1996).

In order to expand the System of Protected Areas, establishment of the Tusheti National Park
and Protected Landscape, the Vashlovani National Park and development of the oldest
Lagodekhi Reserve is under preparation with the support of GEF and World Bank.
Protected territories are likely to play one of the main roles in the development of ecotourism
since they comprise all elements interesting for nature loving tourists. Proposed management
plans of protected areas imply tourism activity in these areas. In order to achieve the
conservation of natural and historic-cultural heritage and sustainable social-economic
development of the regions, a proper planning and management of protected areas is
necessary.
Planning a New System of Protected Areas
A New System of Protected Areas is actually in the process of creation. In order to carry out
the planning of a new system relatively large territories (preferable with distinguished physical-
geographical boundaries) are selected for protected territories, where correspondingly with the
scientific information unique ecosystems are conserved, rare species of animals and plants are
spread, aesthetically attractive natural landscapes, separate unique natural objects, and
historical-cultural heritage are saved. Such ten regions have been selected:
1.   Borjomi-Kharagauli;
2.   Eastern Caucasus;
3.  Iori plateau;
4.   Erusheti;
5.  Ajara-Imereti;
6.  Kolkheti;
7.  Central Caucasus;
8.  Shavsheti;
9.  Apkhazeti;
10. Kolkheti proposed (in perspective) protected areas region"6.
The work on the establishment of a New System of Protected Areas is carried out under the
leadership of the Protected Areas Development Center in cooperation with the World Wide
Fund of Georgia, the Ministry of Environment, State Department of Protected Areas, Nature
Reserves and Hunting Farms, and State Department of Forest Management.
Law on Protected Areas adopted in 1996 governs the creation and extension of protected
areas, in addition in giving parliament the right to create other types of protected areas.
Separate legislation is enacted for each protected area and defines the boundaries of the area,
the boundaries of zones within the overall area, the activities, which are permitted in each
zone, and details of the administrative structure and the management regime.
The planning work began several years ago. In the first stage the Borjomi-Kharagauli protected
areas region has been planned and National Park has been established. The Cabinet of
Ministry adopted sound regulation 'About Development of Assisting Measures for the System
of Protected Areas and Establishment of Borjomi-Kharagauli National Park" (N" 447, July 28,
1995), which was practically fundamental for the creation of a New System of Protected Areas.
The Law on Creation and Management of the Kolkheti Protected Areas came into force on
January 1, 1999 (and was amended in September 1999). It aims to provide for the creation of
the Kolkheti protected areas in Western Georgia and to regulate the management of these
areas, which include the Kolkheti National Park, the Kobuleti State Reserve and the Kolkheti
Multiple Use Area.
*6 Kokheti proposed protected areas region (which extends from the Engun River to the North) is considered to be perspective area tor protection in
the future: however, it is not exactly designated yet.

National Forests Development Project
At present, Protected Areas Development Center, who is in charge of the Protected Areas
Development Project prepared with assistance the World Bank, is working in the Central
Caucasus region on development of protected areas. GEF-funded Protected Areas
Development Project is expected to be implemented in parallel with the NFDP and to
complement its activities, specially in the program's Laboratory Zone composed of four districts
(Ambrolauri, Lentekni, Oni and Tsageri) located in the Central Caucasus Mountains (see figure
1).
The objectives of Protected Areas Development Project are to: "(i) establish ecologically
effective protected areas, (ii) integrate biodiversity conservation into forestry and range
management, (iii) strengthen the institutions responsible for biodiversity conservation
programs, (iv) improve the ecological basis for landscape planning, (v) improve the public
awareness of Georgian biodiversity, and (vi) promote international cooperation in
Transcaucasus biodiversity conservation".

2.5  Cultural Heritage
Racha Region
Historical province Racha, is old cultural region of the West Georgia's highlands. Racha is rich
in monuments of the cultural heritage, chronological range of which is quite wide from IX to XX
centuries. Racha is the only region within Georgia where the typical Svaneti dwelling-defensive
type of architecture - "tower-house" existing only in the temi (community) is used, namely in the
village of Geba that borders Svaneti.
The 1991 earthquake caused a great damage to Racha. Many monuments of high artistic
value were destroyed.
Lechkhumi Region
Lechkhumi, one of the magnificent historical provinces of Georgia, is situated on the middle
section of the Tskhenistskali and Rioni Rivers. Lechkhumi was populated from the ancient
times. Churches of early feudal period are less preserved in Lechkhumi, but fortresses and
towers are in abundance, giving the region a distinctive appearance.
Lechkhumi had been one of the significant regions of Georgia for centuries that was
adequately reflected in the architectural monuments, main features of which, despite some
peculiarities, follow the common course of development of general Georgian architecture.
Jurisdiction of historical sites and over the forests adjacent to the historical sites
Department of Preservation of Historic Monuments has the jurisdiction of historical sites within
the Forest Fund. Forests adjacent to the historical sites are managed by the State Department
of Forest Management. Historical sites are indicated on the map. There is no special provision
in the Forest Code regarding the cultural heritage sites, however, in practice, the SDFM always
tries to avoid issuance of licenses close to historic sites due to respect to both the cultural
heritage and local population. In case of accidental find of cultural sites while forest activities,
the Department of Preservation of Historic Monuments must be notified.

3.  LEGISLATION
3.1  Existing conditions
The Georgian legislation in the field of protection, rehabilitation and use of forests consists of
the Constitution, international agreements, laws on Environmental Protection, System of
Protected Territories, Fauna, Water Resources, land legislation, the Forest Code and other
regulations (see Chaper 15, References and Bibliography). Regulations currently in force have
the following hierarchy according to their legal effect:
1. The Constitution;
2. International agreements signed by Georgia;
3. Organic Law; Decree of the President of Georgia which deals with issues considered by
the Article 46 of the Constitution. This includes the Organic Law on Local Governments
and Self-Governments;
4. Law; Decree of the President, which does not deal with issues considered by the Article
46 of the Constitution. This includes all other laws and codes discussed below;
5. Order of the President;
6. Resolution of the Parliament;
7. Order of the State Minister;
8. Resolution of the National Regulating Commission on Energy; resolution of the National
Regulating Commission on Communications; order of the minister and the head of the
other central body of executive power; resolution of the Commission on Accounting
Standards; resolution of the Board of Auditors; resolution of the Central Election
Committee;
9. Order of the Chairman of the Antimonopoly Service;
This list can be extended with the regulations of the National Bank. Regulations issued by the
National Bank and the Chamber of Control, within the framework established by the Georgian
legislation, have priority over other regulations; resolution of the Council of the National Bank
has a priority over the order of the President of the National Bank.

Constitution
The existing Constitution has been adopted on August 24, 1995. It is the supreme law and has
the highest level in the hierarchy of the Georgian laws. The Article 37 of the Constitution served
as a basis both for development of the present environmental policy and creation of existing
environmental legislation: Citizens are entitled to live in a healthy environment and to use
natural and cultural resources of the country as well as are obliged to protect them. The State
provides environmental protection and rational use of natural resources to ensure a healthy
environment for the well being of individuals, according to the environmental and economical
interest of the public, taking into account the interests of current and future generations. Every
person has the right to obtain complete, reliable and timely information regarding the
environmental situation of his/her place of residence and work.
Environmental Legislation
In accordance with the Constitution, Georgia assumed quite serious commitments in the field of
environmental protection and started development of new environmental legislation and
bringing existing legislation to comply with the Constitution for the purpose of fulfillment of
these commitments. The sources for the environmental legislation are: The Constitution,
international agreements in the fields of environmental protection signed by Georgia,
environmental laws and other regulations.
Law on Environmental Protection
The framework Law on Environmental Protection, which came into force on December 10,
1996 is the most important environmental law adopted by the Parliament since enactment of
the Constitution. It regulates legal relationships between State authorities and physical and
legal entities in the field of environmental protection and use of natural resources on the whole
territory of the country (including territorial waters, airspace, continental shelf and the special
economic areas).
The Law sets overall objectives for environmental protection and provides the guiding
principles, trends and mechanisms to be used in achieving such objectives. Special articles are
dedicated to the following issues:
*  Environmental rights and obligations of individuals;
*  Competence of goveming bodies;
*  Environmental education and research;
*  State environmental management;
*   Environmental economic mechanisms;
*  Licensing for environmental activities;
*  Provision of environmental information;
*  Environmental standards;
* Environmental requirements on wastes;
85



ACTA Consultants                                         Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
*  Environmental requirements in decision making and implementation of activities;
*  Extreme environmental conditions;
*  Protection of natural ecosystems; protected areas;
*  Global and regional environmental management;
*  International cooperation in environmental protection; etc.
Article 14 deals with National Report on the State of the Environment. In order to make the
information public, the Ministry of Environment annually submits a national report on the State
of the Environment to the President. The President issued the order on June 25, 1999
establishing the rules for drafting the National Report on the State of the Environment.
Notwithstanding of the Law requirement, no report has been published yet.
The Law on Environmental Protection defines qualitative environmental standards. According
to the Law, these standards are to be defined every five years by the regulations on Qualitative
Environmental Standards developed and approved by the Ministry of Health in coordination
with the Ministry of Environment. Unfortunately, no regulation has been enacted yet. At
present, the old Soviet outdated regulations are still effective. Water quality is regulated by the
Rules for Protection of Surface Waters from Pollution with Wastewater issued by the Ministry of
Health, Ministry of Water Industry and Ministry of Fishery of former USSR in 1974, and
modified in 1974 and1990. The qualitative standards of water are given in the annex of these
regulations. According to the information of the Ministry of Environment, new regulations will be
developed in 2001.
As required by the Law on Environment Protection, any industrial or commercial activity
requires an Environmental Permit issued by the relevant govemmental body, and licenses for
the use of natural resources (land, water, forest, flora, fauna, mineral resources). The 12 th
Chapter of the Law is dedicated to the protection of ecosystems. For the purpose of
regeneration of wildlife and plants and conservation of ecosystems, their use shall be limited
and are subject to licenses. Any kind of activity, which may threat flora and fauna, habitats,
breeding places and migration routes, is prohibited. The Law on Environmental Protection says
that rules for protection of flora and fauna and their use shall be established, which is still
incompletely accomplished.
The frame Law on Environmental Protection introduces the following Principles:
Risk Reduction:         a developer is obliged to take all relevant measures to minimize or
eliminate the risk of damage to human health or the environment.
Priority Setting:        activity potentially causing the negative impact on the environment
and human health must be replaced with a less risky activity being
it even more expensive. Preference should be given to the latter if
its cost is lower than that for compensation of damage incurred to
the environment by the lower cost option.
Waste Minimization:     priority is to be given to technologies that minimize waste
generation.
Protection of Biodiversity: activity should not lead to irreversible degradation of biodiversity;
Restitution:            environment degraded by an operation should be restored to a
state as close as possible to the original.

User Pays:              business users must pay for the use of natural resources (land,
water, forest, flora, fauna, mineral resources, etc).
Polluter Pays:          polluters must bear the costs of the damage to the environment.
Sustainability:         natural resources and the environment are to be used in ways that
do not hamper society's development nor cause irreversible
quantitative or qualitative changes to the environment.
On June 30, 2000, the Parliament introduced amendments into the Law on Environmental
Protection, which specified responsibilities of the State bodies in the field of environment. The
following caused these amendments: according to the order of the President, done on
February 24, 2000, the Department of Hydrometeorology parted from the Ministry of
Environment and constitutes a separate governmental agency (The State Department of
Hydrometeorology).
National Environmental Action Plan
Preparation of the first National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) commenced in 1996 and
was completed in 2000. The program has been developed with the financial assistance of the
World Bank and involved key government organizations, academic bodies and NGOs. The
NEAP has been adopted and approved by the Presidential Order # 191 issued on May 20,
2000. At present, NEAP has authority of a regulation.
Elaboration of NEAP was a milestone achievement on behalf of the Georgian Environment,
and represents not only a broad statement of government policy, but also a framework for
specific government actions and further policy. However, the document seeks to identify the
key issues which need to be addressed in various sectors, and goes some way to outlining the
measures necessary to allow correction of current environmental problems, it has been
criticized by some for being too general and descriptive, and lacking in specific actions. As
regards forest sector, the National Environmental Action Plan is rather general. It is more a
description of existing situation of country's forests rather than a program of activities. The
NEAP envisions reforms in the following priority directions:
*  preservation of the diversity of forest ecosystems;
*  ensuring stable regeneration of forest resources;
*  improvement of the relevant legal base;
*  training of personnel in sustainable management; ensuring improvement of social and
economic conditions of the staff;
*  reform of the forestry system, by making it independent from entrepreneurial activity;
*  providing conditions which will attract private investments into forestry.
The program is planned for the period 2000-2004, however, there is no specific activity
planned, scheduled and responsibility assigned to forest related activities.
Environmental Permits, State Ecological Expertise and Environmental Impact
Assessment17
The Law requires issuance of appropriate environmental permits prior to the implementation of
any activity on the territory. Two laws: the Law on Environmental Permits and the Law on State
rLaws on Envronmental Permits and State Ecological Expertise are attached in Annex 5.
87



ACTA Consultants                                           Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
Ecological Expertise (see annex 5) establish the legal basis for providing the public with
information and its participation in the decision making process on the matter of issuance of
environmental permits, State ecological expertise and environmental impact assessment.
These two laws came into force on January 1, 1997.
The Law on Environmental Permits divides activities into 4 categories, according to their size,
importance and potential impact on the environment. The State Ecological Expertise shall be
carried out for activities of all 4 categories (The rules for conducting State Ecological Expertise
are established by the law).
According to the Section M of the Article 4 of the Law on Environmental Permits, project on
forest management, long-term programs on rehabilitation of protected areas, as well as plans
and projects on protection and use of water, land, mineral and other natural resources are
activities classified in Category I. Conduction of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is
required prior to applying for environmental permits for implementation of activities of Category
1.
It should be noted that the law considers exceptional cases when environmental impact
assessment is not required:
1. The investor repeats or continues already started activity for which environmental impact
assessment has already been done and the new assessment process will not contain
additional data;
2. State interests require immediate decision-making and start of activities.
According to the Law on Environmental Permits, the procedure for issuance of Environmental
Permits for activities of Category I is the following (Article 7):
1. Investor is required to carry out environmental impact assessment prior to apply for
environmental permits for implementation of activities of Category I;
2. In order to carry out environmental impact assessment properly and to provide public
participation in this process, investor has the right to:
* conduct public discussion of the environmental impact assessment according to the
Article 15 of this Law;
 provide the public with the access to the materials of the research conducted during
the environmental assessment process.
3. After submission of the application for activity, the Ministry of Environment shall follow
the procedure described by this Article, which includes the State Ecological Expertise
(the procedure for conducting the State Ecological Expertise is regulated by the relevant
legislation) and public participation in decision-making in the process of issuance of
environmental permit.
4. For the purpose of informing the public, within 10 days of submission of the application,
the Ministry of Environment shall:
. publish the application with attached short annotation in mass media with the
indication of time and place of public discussion on the matter of implementation of
activities.
* receive and consider comments submitted in written form by the public within 45 days
after publishing of information regarding activity.
5.  The Ministry of Environment shall conduct the public discussion on the matter of
implementation of activity with participation of the representatives of the investor, the
Ministry of Environment, local authorities and the public within 2 months of submission of
the application;
88



ACTA Consultants                                           Sectoral Environmental Assessment

6. Documentation proving the validity of activities shall be considered in the Ministry of
Environment within 3 months.
7. The copy of the application is to be stored in that Department of the Ministry of
Environment where the public discussion of the documentation proving the validity of
activity will be conducted. Representatives of the public have the right to examine the
application (except the parts containing commercial, industrial and State secrets) within
the period of consideration of the application on the basis of request.
8. During this period, the Ministry of Environment shall:
* Conduct the State Ecological Expertise of the documentation proving the validity of
activities;
. Determine whether the activity or its components are in compliance with the
Georgian legislation;
* Determine whether the activity or its components are in compliance with the existing
environmental standards effective in Georgia;
* Determine measures which shall be carried out in case of implementation of activity
for mitigation of the environmental impact;
* Make a decision on issue of the environmental perrmit for a certain activity on the
basis of the State Ecological Expertise taking into account the public opinion.
Activities of Category II do not require environmental impact assessment (Article 8), but will be
subject to the application of State Ecological Expertise (SEE). Public participation is required.
Procedure for issue of environmental permits for activities of Category IlIl includes SEE and
public notification about planned activities (Article 9). SEE of activities is required. Activities of
Category IV also require SEE (Article 10), but in this case, public participation and notification
are not required.
Forest Code of Georgia
The Law of Georgia - Forest Code has been adopted by the Parliament on June 22, 1999.
The Forest Code includes the following definitions of the forest area:
a) Georgian Forest Fund - integrity of forests and their resources owned by the State
Forest Fund and forests under different types of ownership
b) State Forest Fund - integrity of State Forests of Georgia, as well as lands and resources
attributed to these forests
c)  State Forest - forest owned by the State.
The Code says that forests are in ownership of the State. According to the Section 1 of the
Article 9, forests can be in ownership of the State, the Patriarchy of Georgia, a physical or legal
entity. This article will come into force only after the enactment of the Law on Privatization of
Forests owned by the State.
Legal and physical persons using forests and forest resources or engaged in forestry activities,
as well as the Patriarchy of Georgia are deemed to be subjects of relationships along with the
State.
Forests are divided into the following categories according their institutional management:
89



ACTA Consultants                                           Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Proiect
a) protected areas of State forests, covering territories of State forests and territories
specified by the Law on Protected Area System;
b) State forestry (managed by the State Department of Forest Management), which
includes local forests.
Protected areas of State Forests are regulated by the State Department of Protected Areas,
Nature Reserves and Hunting Farms; the State forestry, except local forests - by the State
Department of Forest Management, and the local forests - by local authorities through the
relevant services.
Chapter X (Article 35) of the Forest Code defines participation of representatives of population
and public organizations in management of the State Forest Fund. In cases described in the
Article 35, organizations having right of management of the State Forest Fund shall consider
comments and proposals made by representatives of population and public organizations prior
to making a decision.
The SDFM, State Department of Protected Areas, Nature and Hunting Farms and other bodies
authorized by the legislation shall ensure:
1. availability of information on the condition of the State Forest Fund, excluding pieces of
information disallowed for disclosure by legislation;
2. promulgation of forest protection and forest resource protection measures; elaboration of
training programs for raising of public awareness.
3. provision of moral and material incentives for conserving biodiversity.
At present, no detailed procedure for ensuring public participation in decision-making process
exists. According to the Forest Code, the Law on Privatization of State Forests shall be
adopted by January 1, 2002. Privatization issues are discussed in the chapter 5 Forest
ownership.
For the purpose of enactment of the Forest Code, issuance of 11 orders of the President, 6
orders of the Minister of Environment and 18 orders of the Chairman of the State Department
of Forest Management is considered. At the beginning of 2001, many of those orders have not
been issued yet.
The Forest Code has been amended on November 10, 2000 as a result of adoption of the Law
on Special Preservation of State Forest Fund and the Plantation within the Tbilisi City and
Neighboring Territories (10.1 1.2000).
Law on Protected Areas
The Law on Protected Areas System, enacted on March 7, 1996 regulates creation and
functioning of the system of protected areas. The Law defines the following categories of
existing protected areas:
* State Nature Reserve;
* National Park;
* Natural Monument;
* Managed Nature Reserve;
* Protected Landscape; and
* Multiple Use Area.
90



ACTA Consultants                                        Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
Existence of categories included in the international network of Protected Areas is assumed:
Biosphere Reserves; World Heritage Sites and Wetlands of international significance.
The Parliament makes decisions on creation, extension and increasing of protection category
of Protected Areas. According to the Article 17 of the Law on Protected Areas System,
maintenance of the cadastre of Protected Areas is required. The cadastre has to be maintained
by the Protected Area Service.
Law on Protection of Flora from Harmful Organisms
A great extent of the issues of protection of flora are regulated by the Law on Protection of
Flora from Harmful Organisms, adopted on October 12, 1994 and then complemented by the
Law on Changes and Amendments into the Law on Protection of Flora from Harmful
Organisms (16.04.1999). The main goals of the Law are to:
1. protect cultivated plants, pastures, hayfields and forests from  harmful organisms
(vermin, diseases, weeds);
2. prevent undesirable impact on human health, flora and fauna, overall biosphere caused
by the use of flora protective means;
3. provide the means for protection of flora and phytogenic products from  harmful
organisms with legal basis;
4. ensure the implementation of international and national regulations in the field of
protection of flora;
5. implement the State target programs on liquidation and prevention of spread and
evolution of quarantine and especially dangerous harmful organisms.
Law on Wildlife
The Law on Wildlife came into force on December 26, 1996. The Law regulates all aspects of
the protection of wild animals and their habitats. According to the Law, fauna is in the State
ownership (with some exceptions) and any action encroaching the State's right of ownership is
prohibited.
According to the Article 32 of the Law, when using and developing natural ecosystems,
landscapes and other territories maximum allowable standards of stress on them
(Environmental stress standards) shall be established.
Environmental stress standards include quotas on use of natural resources, which are to be
established taking into account the principles of sustainable development at a governmental
level. Quotas on use of certain types of natural resources are to be established at regional and
local levels.
Environmental stress standards shall be developed and approved by the Ministry of
Environment in every 5 years. Unfortunately, like a majority of regulations on wildlife, no such
kind of regulations is effective (the Law considers adoption of 34 sets of regulations).
Pesticides and Agricultural Chemicals
The Law on Pesticides and Agricultural Chemicals has been adopted on November 25, 1998.
The purpose of the Law is to provide the basis for effective use and environmentally safe
consumption of pesticides and agricultural chemicals.
91



ACTA Consultants                                        Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
The Law regulates State management, production, registration, labeling, packing, distribution,
storage, transportation, use, neutralization, disposal, information interchange, advertisement,
import and export of pesticides and agricultural chemicals in the field of effective use and safe
consumption of agricultural chemicals and biological means. The Law refers to FAO
recommendation on use of pesticides and agricultural chemicals.
Law on Water Resources
The Law on Water Resources came into force on October 16, 1997. The purposes of the Law
are:
1. implementation of a uniform State policy in the field of protection and use of water;
2. protection of water bodies (including the Black Sea) and rational use of water resources
taking into account interests of present and future generations and the principles of
sustainable development;
3. satisfaction of drinking water needs;
4. sustainability of water fauna and sustainable use;
5. prevention of harmful impact of water and effective elimination of results;
6. advocacy of State interests in the field of protection, use and international trade of water;
7. production of water commodity output according to the international principles and
standards;
8. protection of legal rights and interests of natural and legal persons in the field of use and
protection of water.
The Law on Water Resources is connected with the land legislation and legislation of forest
and protected areas. Water resources on the national territory are in State ownership. A special
license issued by the authorized State agency is required for obtaining the right for use of
water.
For the actual enactment of the Law on Water Resources, the Law considers adoption of 37
regulations, out of which 12 have been developed by the Ministry of Environment, but only 10
of them have a legal force, only these ten have been published in the official printed media, as
it is required by the Law on Normative Acts.
On June 30, 2000, the Parliament introduced amendments into the Law on Water Resources,
which defined that the Ministry of Environment and the State Department of Hydrometeorology
have to undertake the State monitoring of water within their competencies. These changes
were caused by the order of the President done on February 24, 2000, according to which the
Department of Hydrometeorology parted from the Ministry of Environment and formed as a
separate governmental agency.
Law on Regulation and Engineering Protection of the Georgian Coastal Zone and
Riverbanks
The Law on Regulation and Engineering Protection of the Georgian Coastal Zone and
Riverbanks was enacted in November 2000. This Law establishes the legal status of the
complex and rational use of the Georgian coastal zone and riverbanks and provides their
sustainability; regulates legal relations between authorities, natural and legal persons active in
this field; establishes the forms of responsibility and the State control over activities provoking
erosive and abrasive processes.

ACTA Consultants                                          Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
According to this Law, the Ministry of Urbanization and Construction (in cooperation with
various govemmental agencies) shall:
1. Develop and approve the rules for regulation and engineering protection of the Georgian
coastal zone and riverbanks within 6 months upon enactment of this Law;
2. Develop general schemes for regulation and engineering protection of the Georgian
coastal zone and riverbanks until 2005.
Tax Code and Customs Legislation
The Tax Code has been adopted on June 13, 1997, effective since June 24, 1997. Many
changes and addenda have been introduced into the Code during last years. Three chapters
deal with the environmental issues:
1. Chapter 10 establishes tax rates on use of natural resources (including forest
resources);
2. Chapter 11 establishes taxes on pollution of the environment with harmful substances;
3. Chapter 11 contains the list of harmful substances and taxes to be paid for pollution of
natural resources with these substances of different concentration.
The Customs Code is effective since January 1, 1998. The Code establishes the legal,
economical and organizational basis for implementation of the customs policy. It defines duties
and responsibilities of customs and other governmental organizations, legal and physical
persons in the process of implementation of customs policy.
Law on Customs Tariffs and Tax has been adopted on February 18, 1998. This law establishes
types and rates of taxes for customs procedure set by the Customs Code, for issuance of
licenses by customs bodies and rules and terms of payment of these taxes.
The Law on the Customs Fees has been adopted on March 20, 1998. The Law establishes the
rule for introduction and use of customs duties, mechanisms of external economic policy and
State regulation of commodity market after crossing the customs border and rules for taxation
of goods when crossing the customs border.
Code on Administrative Offences
The Code on Administrative Offences is effective since January 1, 1985 with many
amendments and addenda introduced during these years. This Code establishes activities to
be qualified as an administrative offence, administrative sanctions to be imposed on the
offender, the authorized body (authorized person) and rules for imposing such sanctions.
Chapter 7 defines administrative offences in the field of environmental protection, use of
natural resources, protection of historic and cultural monuments. This Chapter contains the
articles establishing administrative sanctions for the violation of rules set by the legislation on
land, forest, air, water and protected areas. 6th Chapter of the Code on Administrative Offences
provides articles, which regulate administrative charges (penalties) for violation of
administrative rules of State properties including forest, water, mineral resources and wildlife.

Criminal Code
The Criminal Code (adopted on July 22, 1999) sets the basis for criminal responsibility, defines
actions to be qualified as a crime and establishes appropriate penalties or other measures.
Chapter 36 specifies crimes in the field of environmental protection and use on natural
resources. According to the Code the following actions are considered as a criminal offence
and are subject for criminal prosecution:
1. violation of the environmental rules during industrial activities;
2. violation of rules of treatment of environmentally harmful substances and waste;
3. violation of veterinary and pest-control rules;
4. violation of water use rules; pollution of water;
5. pollution of the sea;
6. hiding of information about pollution of the sea with substances and waste harmful for
the human health and sea fauna by the authorized person;
7. atmosphere air pollution;
8. violation of the legislation on the Georgian continental shelf, territorial waters and special
economic area;
9. degradation of soil; violation of rules of extraction and protection of minerals;
10. illegal use of minerals;
11. illegal catching of fish and water fauna; illegal hunting; destruction of habitats and
reproduction sites of endangered plants and animals included in the Red Data Book of
Georgia;
12. illegal cut of wood and bushes;
13. damaging and destruction of forests and plantations;
14. violation of the order of protected areas;
15. conduction of Category I activity without environmental permits.
Land Legislation
Land-related issues are regulated by the Constitution, international agreements and other
regulations and normative acts, including Legislation on Forest, Water Resources, Agricultural
and Non-agricultural Land, Privatization, the Tax Code, Civil Code, Criminal Code, Code on
Administrative Offences, Laws on Soil Protection, Melioration and other regulations.
The State registration of ownership on land is the essential part of the Georgian Land Cadastre
and contains data on boundaries and qualitative-quantitative and legal status of land parcels
and real estate attached to the land parcels. The Law on Land Registration states that the
rights on land are to be registered in the Public Register. The State control of protection and
purposeful use of lands, maintenance of the State cadastre and registration, as well as
protection of soils are main responsibilities of the State Department of Land Management.
Land Legislation establishes different rules for agricultural and non-agricultural lands. Following
laws regulate those issues:
1. Law on Ownership of Agricuitural Lands;
94



ACTA Consultants                                        Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
2. Law on the Rule of Declaring Non-agricultural Lands Owned by Juridical and Private
Persons as a Private Property;
3. Law on Management and Disposal of Agricultural Lands Owned by State;
4. Law on the Reimbursement of a Substitute Land Cultivation Costs and the Payment of
Damages in Cases of Allocation of Agricultural Land for Non-agricultural Purposes;
5. The Civil Code;
6. The Tax Code;
7. The Code on Administrative Offences;
8. The Criminal Code.
Law on Soil Protection regulates the issues of soil protection. The problem of protection of
soil is crucial, as having insufficient land, where soil erosion, pollution, secondary water
logging, ponding and salinity, open-cut mining and improper industrial activities cause losses of
soil. Taking into account all these problems, the Law on Soil Protection (adopted on May 1994)
has to provide integrity of soil, growth and maintenance of prolificacy.
This Law regulates the norms and standards for maximum allowable concentration of harmful
substances in the soil to ensure human well-being, protection of flora and fauna and the natural
environment in general.
Law on Melioration regulates legal relationships between governmental structures and natural
and legal persons in the field of melioration of lands. The Law has been adopted on October
16, 2000 and amended on March 7, 2000 by the Law on Changes and Amendments to the Law
on Melioration. These changes deal with definition of the status and responsibilities of
amelioration service associations, water users associations and drainage service associations.
Prohibitions of Commercial Logging and Exportation and Results of these Bans
The Cabinet of Ministers made the first step towards regulation of the export of wood on
November 30, 1995, when the export of wood became a subject for licensing. The President
raised this issue on April 11, 1996 with the order #270 on the regulation of export of scrap of
ferrous and non-ferrous metals, manganese silicate (secondary) and wood and emphasized
that the export of wood requires licensing.
The Law on Export License Tax for Wood Materials was adopted on March 31, 1998 and was
shortly cancelled by the Law #1469 on Managed Use of Wood on the Territory of Georgia
dated June 25, 1998. This Law cancelled also the Presidential Decree #270, however it better
regulated the wood exportation issues. In addition, the Law on Managed Use of Wood on the
Territory of Georgia prohibited forest felling on the territory of the State Forest Fund for the
timber production purpose. The Law on Managed Use of Wood on the Territory of Georgia was
cancelled after enactment of the Forest Code.
The export of wood has never been prohibited by Law. The last ban, based on the Decree, has
been cancelled in November 1995. Lobbying of such prohibition in the Parliament in 1998-99
has not been successful, however, lobbying is being continuing.
3.2  Impact analysis and Mitigation Measures
Considering Georgia's legal, institutional and political situation, a major characteristic is the
imperfect enforcement of existing laws. For instance, in the field of forest management,
poaching and illegal cutting are widely observed. Legal requirements conceming forest
95



ACTA Consultants                                            Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
rehabilitation and protection are not met. Insufficient institutional capacity of enforcing the
legislation is a decisive factor, discussed under Institutions.
Issue 1: improving the forest legislation
Given the situation of low institutional capacity, incomplete enforcement regulations constitute
another important obstacle for the implementation of existing laws. This is particularly the case
for following laws:
*    Law on Environmental Protection: there are no rules for drawing of the Red List and the
Red Data Book of Georgia. As a consequence, no updated Red List and no Red Data
Book exist. A Red Data Book dating from the Soviet period is sometimes mentioned in
reports, but its validity is doubtful.
*    Forest Code: the Minister of Environment has not issued any of the orders mentioned
in articles 116 and 117 of the Forest Code. The President issued 6 orders considered
by the Forest Code, and the Chairman of the State Department of Forest Management
issued only 6 orders (see chapter 15). It should be noted, that the President and the
Chairman of the State Department of Forest Management have issued some forestry-
related regulations, which are not considered by the Forest Code.
After its enactment, some old forestry-related regulations were cancelled, but the Forest Code
is de facto not effective because more than half of regulations needed for its enactment have
not been issued. The validity of regulations issued during the Soviet period is not clear. The law
says nothing about abrogation of these regulations, however the use of these regulations is
doubtful from the legislative point of view. The Forest Code does not offer alternatives to these
regulations; for example, about long term planning of forest resources and new standards18
have not been established.
The Forest Code makes distinction between 'types of cuts" in Articles 68, 70, 99 and following.
Such a precise distinction would be interesting in a handbook. In a Law, such element
complicates the text and is of no help for forest management. Generally speaking, the Forest
Code is so intricate that its enforcement will be difficult. It might be not useful to mitigate
negative environmental impacts and generate positive social benefits.
Mitigation measures 1:
1.1 To support the implementation of the 1999 Forest Code, a simplification of this Code
should be considered. A streamlined Forest Code should be reduced to the principles,
while enforcement issues will be handled in the regulations.
1.2 Rules that shall be declared void should be listed and be declared void as soon as
possible.
1.3 Missing regulations shall be issued by the responsible authorities. Coherence with other
rules shall be checked. For instance, regulations for long term planning of forest
resources shall be created.
Issue 2: contradictions between Laws, especially overlapping of competences
The Forest Code contradicts with land legislation and often gives reason of serious violations.
For example, according to the Law on Management and Disposal of Non-agricultural Land
se Regarding standards it should be noted, that on the basis of the intemabonal agreement on coordinated policy in the field of standardizabon,
meteorology and certifcation done in Moscow on March 13, 1992 Georgia did not cancel State standards of the former Soviet Union. Some
govemmental structures are stil using these standards today.
96



ACTA Consultants                                            Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
owned by the State, lands of the State Forest Fund may be considered as a non-agricultural
land parcel; thus, they might be privatized according to the existing legislation on privatization.
The priority of the Forest Code in this case is doubtful19. As a result of this conflict some cases
of privatization of forestlands have occurred.
In many cases competences of governmental structures are duplicated which hampers their
effective operation. The definition of duties and responsibilities of the State Department of
Forest Management can be the cause of conflicts of interest; this is discussed under the Issue
9 "reorganization of the State Department of Forest Management" in the chapter 4 Institutions.
Mitigation measure 2:
2.1 Laws shall be analyzed and improved in order to clear overlapping competences and
contradictions between laws. If necessary, the Forest Code shall be improved taking into
account all comments and conclusions made by relevant governmental structures.
Issue 3: tax system and local economic development
The Tax Code and customs legislation do not establish any taxes for export of wood. On the
other hand, wood processing arts, craft and industries are confronted with a set of high taxes.
The local transformation of wood, which could generate employment opportunities and indirect
local economic benefits in an economically severely damaged region, is thus discouraged.
Mitigation measure 3:
3.1 The Tax and Customs Code shall be amended to encourage development of alternative,
environmentally safe industries based on the local use of forest resources.
Issue 4: balance between sanctions for illegal cufting and taxes for legal cufting
Illegal commercial cuts, even if their volume is not known, constitute a major problem because
of their negative socio-economical and environmental impacts (see chapter on forest products).
According to the Criminal Code, illegal cut of wood and bushes, illegal hunting, destruction of
habitats and reproduction sites of endangered plants and animals included in the Red Data
Book of Georgia, as well as damaging and destruction of forests are considered as a criminal
offence and are subject to criminal prosecution. In fact, the penalties are often not applied, or at
least not in their full extent, due to corruption and institutional incapacity to implement them.
On the other hand, legal and physical persons practicing commercial logging in a legal way are
subject to relatively high taxes. If those legal taxes are higher than the risk of paying penalties,
it will not encourage legal ways of commercial logging. International experiences in similar
situation of corruption plead for pragmatic fees and taxes, that is to say for a balance between
the taxes for commercial logging and the effectively applied penalties for illegal commercial
logging. As a matter of fact, the effective implementation of the penalties deserves remains an
objective, on the long run.
Mitigation measures 4:
4.1 Incentives shall be created for the law-enforcement agencies to implement sanctions on
illegal actions.
'9 The Forest Code says: 'in case of conflict between provisions of this Code and other forestry-related laws, provisions of this Code shall be used'.
However, the Law on Management and Disposat of Non-agncultural Land owned by State is a special law regarding land and might thus be
accorded prionty.
97



ACTA Consultants                                           Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
4.2 Regarding taxes and fees for commercial logging, the reform of the forestry financial
system foreseen in the Forests Development Project must pragmatically take in
consideration the balance between costs for legal and penalties on illegal logging.
Issue 5: legal basis for environmental impact assessments (EIA) and environmental
permits
There is no specific law on environmental impact assessment in Georgia, though conduction of
EIA is considered by the relevant articles of the Law on Environmental Protection (Article 37)
and the Law on Environmental Permits (Articles 7, 14, 15, 16 and 17). According to the Law on
Environmental Permits, the procedure for conducting EIA is to be determined by the Ministry of
Environment.
In this regard, the MoE has developed a special regulation, which is registered in the Ministry
of Justice (31.05.1999). The MoE follows this regulation while issuing environmental permits.
Unfortunately, this regulation does not have a complete legal basis, since it has not been
published in the Georgian Legislative Bulletin within 7 days after registration in the Ministry of
Justice, as it is required by the Law on Normative Acts.
Mitigation measure 5:
5.1 The laws and regulations concerning EIA and environmental permits must be
issued and legalized.
3.3  Significance of impacts after implementation of mitigation measures
The present situation in Georgia is characterized by a rather low level of enforcement of
existing laws. In this situation, the impact of legal improvements will depend on the institutional
capacity to enforce them, a decisive question discussed under Institutions.
Issuing the necessary regulations, eliminating the ones, which shall be declared void and the
improvement of the Forest Code will have positive environmental and social impacts, as they
make the enforcement of laws possible and controllable.
International Agreements
As outlined in the Law on Conclusion, Ratification, Implementation and Denunciation of

4.  INSTITUTIONS
A Coordinating Commission (the "Steering Committee") of the Forests Development Project
comprising representatives of all relevant ministries, agencies and NGOs, has been
established.
The Forestry Commission, established by the President in 1996, manages important
intergovernmental decision-making at the highest levels.
The Parliamentary Committee on Environmental Protection and Natural Resources is one of
the main stakeholders.
4.1  Existing conditions
Environmental responsibilities of State Authorities, Autonomous Republics of Abkhazia and
Adjara and local governments are determined by the Constitution, Law on Environmental
Protection and other laws and regulations. According to the Constitution, the Meteorological
service, the Environmental Observing System as well as Legislation on Land, Minerals and
Natural Resources are in special jurisdiction of the supreme State authorities. The main criteria
for delimitation of competences between the State Authorities, Autonomous Republics and
local governments are the following:
1. funding sources for environmental activities (State budget, budgets of autonomous
republics and territorial entities);
2. importance of natural resources (resources of State or local importance);
3. scale of environmental impact (impact of transboundary, interregional, regional and local
importance);
4. level of jurisdiction of protected areas.
According to the Forest Code, (Article 7) in all legal affairs concerning the Forest Fund, the
State is represented by the following entities:
e The Ministry of Environment,
* The State Department of Forest Management,
* The State Department of Protected Areas, Nature Reserves and Hunting Farms,
* Local governing and self-governing bodies.
The Ministry of Environment
The Ministry of Environment is a governmental body of executive power, which has wide rights
in the field of environmental protection and use of natural resources. The Ministry is headed by
the Minister, who has five deputies. The structure of the Ministry includes: the Institute of
Environmental Protection; the Research-Scientific Institute of Fishery and the Sea Ecology, the
Center of Environmental Monitoring; the Center for Inventory of Rare and Endangered Species
of Fish.
The Ministry has 16 structural sub-units and a State agency: The State Coordination Agency
for Providing Forecasts of Natural and Manmade Disasters, Mitigation its Consequences and
Environmental Safety of Population. The Ministry has 12 regional offices (see organization

The primary functions of the Ministry are as follows:
*  execution of intersectoral management;
*  state management of environmental protection and rational, sustainable use of natural
resources;
*  management of meteorological service;
*  management of environment quality monitoring;
*  other activities set out by environmental legislation.
Development of Environmental Policy is the responsibility of the Department of
Environmental Policy, supported by the Department of Environmental Economics. The main
function of the latter is to develop economic instruments and financing mechanisms for
environmental policy and to facilitate their application.
Nature Resource Management and Environmental Control is carried out jointly by the
Departments of Air, Water and Land Protection; Protection of Mineral Resources and Mining,
Biodiversity, etc., in association with the the 12 Regional Departments of the Ministry.
Examination of EIA and Issuance of Environmental Permits is the responsibility of the
Department of Ecological Examination and Environmental Permitting.
Enforcement of Environmental Law is the responsibility of Environmental Inspectors of the
Ministry. The Inspectors act through the local structures of the Ministry and report to
Regional Departments. However they are under the ultimate control of the Department of
Environmental Management based in the central office of the Ministry.
According to the Law on Environmental Protection, the Ministry of Environment is authorized
to issue the following licenses:
*  License for environmental protection activities in particular such as environmental
audit, hydro-meteorological studies and other environmental protection activities,
which requires specific skills.
*  License for negative impact on the environmental, which is given to facility
emitting/discharging harmful waste or having any negative physical impact on the
environment.
*  License for use of natural resources: use of water, forest, flora, fauna, mineral
resources is subjected to licensing. The license is issued with consideration of quotas
fixed for the use of the natural resources.
However, according to the Forest Code the SDFM is authorized to issue license on forest
use. Therefore, there is a discrepancy between the Law on Environmental Protection and the
Forest Code on distribution of authorities on the issuance of a license on forest use.
As it was mentioned above, the MoE is one of the main representatives of the State in
relation of the Forest Fund. Concerning forest resources, according to the Forest Code, MoE
is responsible for the following activities:

governments are to be established in regions and cities, which do not fall under the regional
jurisdiction: cities of Batumi, Rustavi, Sokhumi, Poti, Kutaisi and Tskhinvali. The
representative body of village, community, settlement and city is the "sakrebulo" (assembly)
of village, community, settlement and city, which consists of members elected through direct,
universal elections by secret ballot.
Officials of assemblies of villages, communities, settlements and cities are:
a) Chairman of the assembly;
b) Secretary of the assembly,
c) Chairmen of commissions of the assembly.
The board is the executive body of the assembly. In villages and communities, where the
population does not exceed 3,000 persons, no board is foreseen; responsibilities of the
board are carried out by the "gamgebeli" (governor). The Governor is the head of the board
of the assembly, which is elected by the relevant assembly among its members. At the same
time, the governor of a village, community, settlement and city is head of the assembly.
The representative body of the cities, which do not fall under a regional jurisdiction, is the
assembly. It consists of elected members. The executive authority of such cities is the
municipality. The municipality is a body of the State administration, which at the same time
has executive functions of the assembly. The mayor of the city is to be assigned and
dismissed by the President of Georgia.
The representative body of the region is the assembly of the region, which consists of
elected members. The executive authority of the region is the board. The board is a body of
State administration, which at the same time has executive functions of the assembly. The
board of the region is headed by the governor of the region, which is to be assigned and
dismissed by the President of Georgia. In autonomous republics of Abkhazia and Adjara
governors are to be assigned and dismissed by the supreme representative body with the
consent of the President of Georgia.
As it was mentioned above, local governing and self-governing bodies are one of the main
representatives of the State in relation of the Forest Fund. Competence of the local
governing and self-goveming bodies in managing the Local Forest Fund covers the following:
*   supporting forest tending, protection, restoration, and forest fire fighting activities;
*   developing programs for conducting forest tending, protection, and restoration in
agreement with the authorized State entities and providing support in
implementation of these programs;
*   participating in financing of programs for conducting forest tending, protection, and
restoration, as well as monitoring expenditures for these activities;
*   issuing permit for the local forest use;
*   issuing timber harvesting certificate if timber is produced in the Local Forest Fund;
*   management of agricultural lands under the State Forest Fund in agreement with
other relevant bodies;

*   participating in emergency response measures against the natural disasters;
*   ensuring public environmental education;
*   submitting requests for changing boundaries of the State Forest Fund to the relevant
authorized State entities;
*   application of other rights granted by the Georgian legislation.
Local governing and self-governing bodies manage Local Forest Fund through the
appropriate services. The rights of local governing and self goveming bodies for managing
the Local Forest Fund as well as rules for separating the Local Forest Fund out from the
State Forest Fund are defined in the Presidential decree 'On the Rights of Local Goveming
and Self Governing Bodies for Managing the Local Forest Fund and the Rules for Separating
the Local Forest Fund from the State Forest Fund".
Ministry of Intemal Affairs - Ecopolice
Although, according to the forest related legislation there is no specific authority assigned to
the Ministry of Internal Affairs, responsibilities for environmental control together with regional
and local units of the Ministry of Environment and the State Department of Forest
Management rests with the ecological police subordinated to the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
The Ecopolice is responsible for revealing and preventing illegal wood harvesting, fishing or
hunting. They also have the right to take steps for preventing outbreaks of epidemic diseases
and to expose violations of environmental regulations. However, in general, they are not well
trained for such diverse tasks. Division of responsibilities and obligations between the
Ecopolice and other bodies within the Ministry of Environment is not always clear.
Other governmental agencies related to the forest management
*  Ministry of Agriculture and Food;
According to the Forest Code, there is no specific authority assigned to the Ministry of
Agriculture and Food, however, based on the Presidential Decree # 404, it is to be
involved in the commission in charge of coordinating the process of transferring land
plots of the former collective farms and state farms to the State forestry entities, and
establishing timeframe for transfer.
*  Ministry of Finance;
According to the Forest Code, the Ministry of Finance should be consulted and
considered while making decision on the following issues:
* Preparation of the 'Regulations for the System of State Forest Fund Registry"
* Preparation of the 'Regulations for Preparing Documents Permitting Forest Use,
Expenses for Allocating Cutting Areas and Charging Payment for Recovering
Costs for Allocation of Cutting Areas"

* State Enterprise Lesoproject.
Non-Governmental Organizations
There are more than 300 environmental NGOs operating in Georgia. However, out of them
there are around 10 organizations, which are actively involved in the environmental field.
NGOs are mainly concerned with national environmental problems: sustainable
development, conservation of biodiversity, environmental education and awareness raising,
development of environmental legislation, etc. Some of them are involved in the projects
funded by international financial institutions (World Bank, UN, GEF) and the donor countries.
NGOs participated in development of the documents of the national importance like: the
National Environmental Action Plan, the Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan; the Strategic
Action Plan for Rehabilitation and Protection of the Black Sea. Considering forestry, there are
4-5 NGOs specialized in this field. Generally, due to the lack of information and
communication with the SDFM, their attitude to the forestry issues is quite critical.

4.2  Impact analysis and Mitigation measures
Issue 6: institutional capacity for enforcing legislation
As mentioned in the Chapter 3 Legislation, in short and medium term, legal improvements
must take into account the present low institutional capacity of implementing laws. In the long
run, nevertheless, to manage sustainably its forest, Georgia needs an effective governing
body, which is able to implement its own rules. Many related factors heavily hamper the
administration in the fulfillment of its duties: State Budgets are generally insufficient, officials
spend time and energy trying to compensate for extremely insufficient salaries (if paid),
corruption can be found from the top to the bottom of the hierarchies, etc.
As this problem is not particular to Georgia, the exchange of experiences with other countries
to search for pragmatic and effective solutions will be useful. One must keep in mind that
setting a cohesive system of implementing regulations will need time. The present study will
not give more details on mitigation measures, as a global analysis including international
experiences is needed.
Mitigation measure 6:
6.1 A cohesive system of implementing regulations shall be elaborated.
Issue 7: overlapping geographic and functional competences
Conflict of interests between different Ministries and Departments has important
consequences on Georgia's forests. This involves specifically the Ministry of Environment,
the State Department of Forest Management and the State Department of Protected Areas,
Nature Reserves and Hunting Farms. Indirectly, Customs authorities are involved in the
matters of timber exports24. The Paragraph 2.4 Protected Areas discusses the specific
conflict of interests regarding establishment of protected areas in the Laboratory Zone.
Some competence conflicts are caused by contradicting regulations. Corresponding legal
adaptations are discussed in the chapter 3 Legislation.
Mitigation measure 7:
7.1 In order to clarify geographic and functional competences overlapping
competencies shall be put in evidence, discussed and eliminated through
transparent and formal agreements.
Issue 8: implementation of the Law on Local Governments and Self-Govemments
Most of the implementation of the Law on Local Govemments and Self-Govemments
remains to be done. Existence of legitimate local authorities will be an asset for local
socioeconomic development in the Lab Zone. Furthermore, democratically elected local
authorities might be more concemed to sustainable forest management, including the
protective function against natural hazards, than distant Ministries or Departments. Central
administration remains nevertheless important, for instance, for the overall control on legal
implementation. In the long run, a balanced coordination between central and local
authorities adapted to Georgia's situation must be found.
According to regulations in case of captured contraband. itegal wood must be confiscated and sold at the auctions by the SDFM.

ACTA Consultants                                         Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
Mitigation measure 8: no mitigation measure is needed.
Additional measure 8:
8.1 Local communities shall receive an adequate legal status to assume rights
and responsibilities in local forest management.
Issue 9: reorganization of the State Department of Forest Management
An important issue will be the separation between two functions subject to conflict of
interests: implementation control and economic production. In the present situation, the same
Department is in charge of establishing and controlling restrictions on resource use while
having financial interests in logging. Decision-making is thus difficult and does not guarantee
a sustainable forest use with low environmental impact.
Under one set of reform proposals, one organization would be responsible for the
development of policy and strategy as well as the supervision of the legal implementation.
Other organizations would carry out commercial activities, which would be controlled by the
first structure.
Mitigation measure 9: No mitigation measure is needed.
Additional measures 9:
9.1 An institutional reorganization plan will be prepared for strengthening the
regulatory functions of the SDFM, streamlining central and local planning
and supervising capacities, and ensuring coordination with other line
agencies.
9.1 The Forest Service must be trained on the implementation of updated
legislation. It will be opportunity to disentangle the net of valid and void
regulations. Innovative and participative training methods will be useful.
Issue 10: improved capacity for environmental management in the forest sector
The evolution of a forestry sector based on a pure mining-style use of wood to an integrated
resource management may be achieved through the implementation of the Sustainable
Forest Management (SFM) concept.
Sustainable Forest Management is a general approach enabling the integration of long-term
considerations and social and environmental aspects in the forest management. This
incorporates issues as biodiversity management, ecosystem health, socioeconomic benefits
and institutional issues; it is discussed in the Chapter 6 Forests Management Planning. The
introduction of Sustainable Forestry Management concept and criteria will require training of
personnel involved. Training should be accomplished with the participation of international
experts. Discussions around Sustainable Forest Management, and especially the definition
of Criteria and Indicators for SFM adapted to Georgia, would constitute an interesting training
opportunity and consensus building process for forestry related actors. Generally speaking,
training in the field with case studies should be promoted.
The inland capacity for Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) is not inexistent if the
know-how of inland consultants in industrial and agricultural sectors is considered. This
needs nevertheless some improvement, especially in the adaptation of analysis schemes to
116



ACTA Consultants                                          Sectoral Environmental Assessment

the specificities of the multifunctional forestry sector. Therefore, staff of the Department of
State Ecological Examination and Environmental Permitting of the MoE and independent
experts reviewing the ElAs must be adequately trained in the assessment of activities
proposed and carried out in the field of forestry. A database should be created in order to
give experts access to information on methods and techniques used in European countries.
Mitigation measures 10:
10.1 Participative training sessions and excursions on the issue of
Sustainable forest management shall be organized. Sharing of
experiences with selected countries might be useful.
10.2 Staff at key positions in the SDFM shall be trained in matters of EIA. For
most of the staff, detail know-how on all aspects of EIA is probably not
necessary.
10.3 Staff of the Department of State Ecological Examination and
Environmental Permitting of the MoE and independent experts reviewing
the ElAs must be adequately trained in the assessment of activities
proposed and carried out in the field of forestry.
10.4 A database should be created in order to give experts access to
information on methods and techniques used in European countries.
Additional measures 10:
10.5 The know-how of local consulting companies in the field of EIA shall be
recognized and improved for use in the forest sector.
4.3  Significance of impacts after implementation of mitigation measures
Institutional changes and in particular improvement of the legal enforcement capacity belong
to the most important challenges for Georgia's forest sector. They will have positive
environmental and social impacts if made in direction of a sustainable use of forest
resources.
If institutional reforms fail, the potential for sustainable forest management might be tenuous,
as most components of improvement strategies rely on functioning institutions. Professional
training in forest management, planning and environmental impact analysis will support
elaboration of ElAs on forestry activities.
Institutional improvements are necessary, but they will take considerable time. That is why
any support project should take in consideration that capacity of legal enforcement might
remain relatively low for the next years.

5.   FOREST OWNERSHIP AND LIABILITY
5.1   Existing conditions
Forest Code
Forests belong currently to the State and are administrated mainly by the State Department
of Forest Management25.
According to Article 9 of the Forest Code:
*   Property rights to the Georgian Forest Fund may be held by the State, by the
Patriarchy of Georgia, by a physical or legal entity of the private law.
*  The Georgian State Forest Fund is a State property and its privatization is
regulated by the law 'On the privatization of Georgian Forests".
*  The State Forest Fund and its resources (excluding forests privatized in
accordance with legislation) are allocated for ownership and use in accordance
with legislation.
As already said in Chapter 3, this article will come into force after the enactment of the Law
on Privatization of Forests owned by the State.
Legal entities of private law are divided into entrepreneurial (commercial) and non-
entrepreneurial (non-commercial) legal entities. A non-entrepreneurial legal entity may be
founded in the form of a union (association) or a fund. The Civil Code defines the status of
non-entrepreneurial legal entities, as well as rules for its establishing and functioning. An
individual enterprise has the status of physical entity. All other enterprises are organizations
and they are legal entity.
According to the Forest Code, the Patriarchy of Georgia has a special status; this is probably
conditioned by the fact that a certain part of forests belonged to the Patriarchy of Georgia
until nationalization of forest by communists. Very likely, that according to the Law on
Privatization of Georgian Forests the Patriarchy will be given preferences in the process of
privatization.
In a coherent application of legal principles, privatization of forests before the enactment of
the Law on Privatization of Georgian Forests is not legal.
Former collective farms and state farms
According to the Parliament Resolution # 671-11 "On Forests of collective farms and
Municipality of the Republic of Georgia" made on 07.03.1995, Kolkhoz and municipal forests
should have been transferred to the State Department of Forest Management within two
months. Resolution envisaged inventory of infrastructure located on Kolkhoz and municipal
forests and their transfer to the SDFM.
Since that time, due to various problems (no financing, no clear definition and boundaries of
Kolkhoz and municipal forests, no technical methodology, etc.) only part of these forests
have been transferred to the SDFM. Forests to be transferred were not determined based on
SDFM  administrates around 2,24 million ha of forests, Mountain Forestry Research Institute administrates around 43,400 ha. Ministry of
Agricufture used to administrate former Kolkhoz forests in the past, but not any more.
118



ACTA Consultants                                           Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
any criteria or rationale. The only rationale during the transfers depended on complexity of
the case and willingness and readiness of key people on site.
At present, there is no clear and reliable data on territories of former Kolkhoz lands
transferred to the SDFM and those of non-transferred. Therefore, on September 12, 2000,
the President issued a Decree # 404 "On Regulations and Timeframe for Transferring Forest
Fund Previously Owned by Collective Farms and State Farms to the State Forestry Entities'
The main tasks of the Decree are:
1. Determination of territories of former collective farms and State farms;
2. Determination of territories of former collective farms and State farms transferred to
the State forestry entities based on the Parliament Resolution # 671-11;
3. Determination of rules and timeframe for transferring of forest fund previously owned
by collective farms and State farms to the State forestry entities.
The Decree determines State bodies to be involved in the coordination of the transfer
process; these bodies are:
 Local governing bodies;
* Ministry of Agriculture and Food through its regional department;
- State Department of Land Management
Local governing and self-governing bodies should create the Commission together with
representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, State Department of Land
Management, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Urbanization and Construction, regional
agencies. The Commission is in charge of coordinating the process and establishing
timeframe for transfer.
The transfer process should have been started after allocation of financing the State budget
to the State Department of Land Management.
The deadline for the transfer of the former collective farms and State farms by the Decree is
1 January, 2002.
Land Registration
Another problem related to the ownership of the forest in particular in case of a privatization
is the land registration of the forest area.
According to the information received from the State Department of Land Management,
responsible for the Land Cadastre, it appears that rural regions and forest territories have not
yet been registered. This situation is caused probably due to the recent introduction of the
Law on Land Registration (Nov. 1996) and the priority given to secure the land property in
urbanized regions of the country.
Actually, a project on the Cadastre and Land Registration of the Rural Regions is being
implemented.
As long as the land cadastre of the forest territory has not been registered according to the
Law on Land Registration, the privatization of the forest, which is a transfer of property of the
119



ACTA Consultants                                           Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Proiect
Forest Fund to a private person or entity cannot take place with enough guarantee to all the
parties concerned.
Land Inforrnation on Georgian Forest Fund
Other projects financed by the World Bank (the Project of Agriculture Development,
Component of Cadastre and Land Registration) are collecting and digitalizing data
concerning the territory of Georgia, like Protected Areas for example.
On the other hand, a lot of geographical information about forest districts and sub-districts
(see Figure 14) - like natural delimitations, zone with the same specie, as well as practical
information on forest exploitation and use are reported on old maps or perhaps only known
from local forest authorities. This information is surely not complete and homogeneous, and
they would not be sufficient for an up-to-date forest management planning.
However, if integrated and coordinated, all this information could be a very useful basis for
developing the Forest Management Information System (FMIS) described in the next chapter
6 Forest Management Planning (see Issues 13 and 16).
5.2 Impact analysis and Mitigation measures
Issue 11: privatization of forests
The issue on privatization of forests is highly controversial. When privatization of industrial
concerns occurred, in the early 90s, many Georgian hoped that new owners would develop
these enterprises. This did not happen often, functioning enterprises were shut down, and
many privatized industries were devastated and destroyed. There is a risk, that forests will
suffer the same fate during the privatization; several reasons speak for a cautious
progression:
-  As mentioned in the Chapter 4 Institutions, law enforcement in Georgia is quite
incomplete nowadays. Level of corruption in many governmental structures and
local governments is high. In this situation, control of the regulations concerning
forest protection during the privatization process is not guaranteed and therefore
illegal logging might occur;
*  As a legal status for local communities does not exist, interests of local
communities might not be protected;
*   Under existing  legislative  (no  limitation  of wood  export), socioeconomic
(uncompetitive wood-processing capacity) and infrastructure conditions (degraded
roads, unstable electricity supply) prevailing in the Lab Zone, the sole objective of
private entrepreneurs might be the export of raw timber. In this situation,
privatization would not generate much regional socioeconomic benefits;
*   Interests of the majority of population might not be considered during privatization.
70% of Georgians are on the verge of poverty and will have difficulty to take part
actively in the privatization process;
*  Privatization of forests areas used for fuel wood by local people might create
conflicts. In the Lab Zone, a majority of the population is using wood for heating;
*   Lack of land cadastre and registration of the forest territory could be another
reason of conflicts between the different parties concemed.

National Forests Development Project
According to available information, public opinion in Georgia is predominantly against
privatization of forests, most probably due to the previous disastrous experiences in the
industrial sector. The majority of NGOs and some govemmental structures share the same
position.
On the other hand, the State might receive significant income from privatization, which would
help in the budgetary crisis. As mentioned earlier in the present study, according to some
information, State forests have been privatized in eastern Georgia, arguing that the State
Forest Fund can be considered as a non-agricultural land parcel on the basis of the Law on
Management and Disposal of Non-agricultural Land owned by the State. No information is
available on the environmental and social impacts in those cases.
On the basis of available reports, the Forests Development Project does not foresee the
support to privatization of forests in the next 5 years; it merely mentions the preparation and
discussion of the Law on Privatization of State Forests in Georgia.
Mitigation measures 11:
11.1 Existence of recent forest privatizations in Georgia shall be verified and
documented. It will be important and interesting to analyze them and
discuss which are the "lessons leamt".
11.2 In a later phase, at most 1 or 2 tests could be implemented in low-conflict
areas. Documentation and transparency in all activities and decisions will
be essential. Strict conditions for the realization of the tests shall be
defined, regarding, for instance, protective forests and biodiversity
conservation. Reliabilities and penalties in case of legal violations shall be
clearly stated before the beginning of forest use.
11.3 The clarification of regulations defined for State Forests, which will remain
valid in privatized forests, must be done. State bodies will have the
competence and duty to control their enforcement. It will then be
necessary to underline that, against common understanding in Georgia,
private ownership does not imply that the owner can do anything he wants
in his forest. Given this clarification and its implementation, the
environmental situation might not be worse in privatized test plots than it is
the case presently.
Issue 12: transfer of rights and liability on forests to local communities
Community forestry is an alternative to a pure State or a pure private forestry. International
experiences show that transfer of some rights and responsibilities to well defined local
structures can be a very efficient way to improve forest protection and to enhance the local
benefits of forest use.
In several countries where the Forest Service is not able to control the forest management
(in conditions very similar with Georgia), local communities have been able to protect forests
against illegal logging and deforestation. On the base of a negotiated contract, a local
community can help the Forest Department to extend its control in areas where budget limits
hamper the activity of the SDFM now.
Well-documented experiences abroad illustrate how the mutual relations between Forest
Service and local communities evolve gradually into a negotiated partnership. The process
121



ACTA Consultants                                          Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
from a centralized, directive forest management to a partnership management may first
generate negative reactions from the Forest Service and a dubitative attitude from the
communities. As their mutual relations change, the understanding of their own role evolves,
and old reflexes are abandoned. It is interesting to notice how the Forest Service, which is at
the beginning afraid of losing power (which is quite virtual because of missing finances),
gradually wins the acceptance of the population and, finally, gains in effectiveness through
the cooperation with local communities.
Mitigation measures 12:
12.1 The definition of a legal status for local communities will be necessary.
Additional measures 12:
12.2  International experiences in community forestry will be analyzed.
Adaptation to Georgian post-soviet and mountainous conditions is needed.
12.3  1 or 2 tests shall be studied in a well-chosen, "low-conflict" area. An
essential condition of success is a careful support to the internal
community organization and to the discussions between local communities
and Forest service. Much time and energy will be gained by taking
international experiences in community forestry into account.
12.4  The information activities foreseen for promoting public awareness in
sustainable forest management should be expanded to include information
on the experiments in forest privatization and community forestry.
5.3  Significance of impacts after implementation of mitigation measures
The present situation in Georgia is not mature - legally and politically - for the privatization of
forests. Before the implementation of I or 2 tests, the validity of legal restrictions to forest
use in privatized plots shall be clarified and widely publicized. In the future, provided this
clarification and the control of legal enforcement by competent State bodies, impact on the
environment might not be more negative in privatized test plots than under the present State
ownership.
Trials on community forestry, on the other hand, could be tested as soon as solutions are
found for the legal status of communities. Rights and responsibility can be conferred to I or 2
test communities. Adequate, Georgian-borne solutions shall take in consideration the
experiences made abroad for 3 decades. The environmental impact of those trials will be
lower than the present system if socio-organizational specialists carefully follow and support
the internal organization of local structures, change of role of local Forest Service and
establishment of new, transparent relations between them.

6.  FOREST MANAGEMENT PLANNING
6.1  Existing conditions
Traditional soviet-type forest management plans have been elaborated in the past for a
period of validity of 10 years (Oni in 1991-92, Ambrolauri in 1995-96, Tsageri and Lentekhi in
1996-97). For a variety of reasoons (but mainly because of budgetary restrictions), they have
not been fully carried out. They cannot be used for environmental monitoring and it will be
difficult to trace changes in the forests. They do not provide socioeconomic and
environmental information in a form suitable for integrating socioeconomic considerations in
the planning process and for demonstrating how environmental considerations are integrated
in the plans.
Existing plans also show a number of technical weaknesses. Maps of species composition
do not show species mixture, stands are assumed to be even-aged, standing volume is
estimated on the basis of a limited and subjective choice of samples, and growth estimates
do not appear reliable. Harvesting operations are not recorded in the management plans or
on accurate maps, etc.
The need to provide up-to-date forest statistics, improve forest management planning and to
renew management plans is recognized as a priority by the authorities. The new Forest Code
sets general guidelines for forest management planning (art. 27) and requires that
management plans are revised in every 10 years. On the other hand, the forest inventory
and management planning unit "Lesoproject" (Forest Project Institute) does not have the
financial and technical means to carry out its work. Due to low salaries, staff lacks motivation.
Cars, mapping equipment and computers are outdated.
In order to remedy this situation and provide the necessary planning and management
conditions for the future, the Forests Development Project will provide finances to support:
*  "the Setting Up of a Forest Management Information System" (see Preparation
report, annex 4, appendix 7) to help forest managers make long term (strategic)
and short term (operational) decisions at the national as well as at the local
level, including socioeconomic and environmental considerations,
-  "Forest Management Planning and Protection" activities (see Preparation
report, annex 5), needed to prepare model land-use and forest management
plans for the four districts of the Laboratory Zone (to be replicated later in other
regions of Georgia). Regional land use plans should first be elaborated (on a
total area of 460'000 ha), followed by forest inventory and the preparation of
multiple use forest management plans (on 260'000 ha of forests in the
Laboratory Zone).
The support will not be limited to technical assistance. Promotion of public awareness in
sustainable forest management through participatory management planning will be included
in the Forests Development Project. This would contribute to a better understanding of the
forest management process, its issues and its socioeconomic and ecological implications.

6.2  Impact analysis and Mitigation measures
Issue 13: Scope of the forest management plans
Forest management plans in the broad sense (including periodic forest inventory,
classification of forest functions based on comprehensive assessment of needs and values
of the forest resources, determination of management objectives on the basis of multiple-use
strategies, monitoring of ongoing operations and periodic updating of the plans) are indeed
needed for the preservation of the forests and the successful development of the forest
sector.
The development of a Forest Management Information System (FMIS) incorporating
socioeconomic and environmental information will contribute to the inclusion of
socioeconomic and ecological considerations in the planning process. This will have positive
a beneficial environment impact, if used properly. Possible land use conflicts could
nevertheless arise with the Protected Areas Development Project, if their activities are not
properly coordinated.
No mitigation measure is needed.
Additional measure 13:
13. The Forest Management Information System (FMIS) should incorporate
information on protected areas and vice-versa, so that data can be exchanged
between the Forests and the Protected Areas Development Projects, in order to
facilitate the coordination and the resolution of conflicts. In particular, the same
Geographical Information System (GIS) should be used by both projects.
Issue 14: Land use planning
Prior to the elaboration of the multiple use forest management plans, "consensus" land use
planning at the district level involving all stakeholders should take place in order to (among
other things) delineate forest areas for sustainable utilization, protection and conservation.
To gain experience prior to program implementation, such a land use planning exercise was
accomplished in 1998-99 in the Oni district (135,900 ha) in the Laboratory Zone by a
multidisciplinary team. Among other recommendations, it proposed to designate 73,000 ha
(or 54% of the total area) for protection to be managed by the State Department of Protected
Areas, Nature Reserves and Hunting Farms.
In the meantime, these proposals and approaches (see the report "Over-all forest utilization
program for the Oni district') have not been accepted by the staff of the Protected Areas
Development Project. The Central Caucasus Commission, a steering committee appointed to
guide and resolve such conflicts, may have to intervene to break the deadlock. In the
meantime, illegal cutting activities continue in the region.
Mitigation measures 14:
14.1 The Forests and the Protected Areas Development Projects shall agree on
a common methodology for land use planning, using the same classification
criteria for allocating land to defined land uses, taking into account the
principles of multiple use of forests and agriculture and an evaluation of the
ecological and economic values of the various ecosystems, using the notion
of prevailing function (see chapter 7 Protective, Tourist and Cultural Uses).
124



ACTA Consuftants                                        Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
The same guidelines for land use planning should be used for the two
projects.
14.2 The resulting land-use plans should be submitted to an Environmental
Impact Assessment. Representatives of the local population should be able
to express their views at that stage. Remaining conflicts would have to be
resolved by the Central Caucasus Commission.
Issue 15: need of EIA for forest management plans
According to existing legislation, forest management plans are subject to an EIA. On the
other hand, forest management plans will be prepared after land-use plans have been
submitted to an EIA. The long-range decisions will have been taken at this stage (allocation
of land and forests, decisions on the protection of virgin forests, species choice, choice of the
cutting regime, etc.), so that an additional EIA would be superfluous (Infrastructure and
harvesting systems: see Chapter 9, Infrastructure).
Mitigation measures 15: no mitigation measures are needed.
Substitution measure 15:
15.1 The consistency of management plans with multiple use and sustainable
forestry could be evaluated by the Ministry of Environment without carrying
out a full EIA. (This simplification could be possible by adapting and
amending the existing legislation on EIA).
Issue 16: Technical requirements for updating forest management plans
The quality of the management plans will depend on use of appropriate planning methods (to
be addressed by the proposed Forest Management Information System) and on the reliability
of the results of the forest inventories. It is essential to have accurate data on forest areas,
timber volume and growth estimates for the calculation of annual allowable cuts and the
planning of harvesting operations and road construction.
Improved forest inventory methods (including statistical sampling and remote sensing
methods) will be introduced and training will be provided for a number of foresters and
technicians. Data collected will be expanded to include information on ecological conditions
(slope, elevation, etc., as well as pertinent floristic and faunistic data). Model forest
inventories will be carried out in the Oni district, based on the results of the land-use plan,
and later expanded to the other districts of the Laboratory Zone.
Updating forest management plans using the proposed FMIS (based on improved forest
inventory methods and incorporating a Geographical Information System) will have a
beneficial environmental impact.
No mitigation measure is needed.
Additional measure 16:
16.1  In addition to temporary sample plots, a sub-sample of permanent
plots should be laid out in the whole Laboratory Zone, as the starting basis
for modern type of National Forest Inventory for the whole of Georgia. This
National Forest Inventory will eventually provide reliable statistical
125



ACTA Consultants                                          Sectoral Environmental Assessment

information on the forest resources (such as changes in the forest cover,
volume trends, balance between growth and wood harvests), which are
presently lacking and badly needed for policy decisions at the State and
regional levels.
16.2 Permanent sample plots and other monitoring means (such as GIS,
see Paragraph 1.6) will also be used for periodic monitoring (on a 5- to 10-
year rotation) of environmental changes in the forest (and could be
expanded to the protected areas).
6.3 Significance of impacts after implementation of mitigation measures
The adoption of a Forest Management Information System, the elaboration of land-use plans
on a district basis and of multiple use and sustainable forest management plans will provide
a much improved management basis, where environmental considerations can be accounted
for. Mitigation measures are proposed to improve land-use planning. Forest management
planning (and control) will have positive environmental impacts, if its objectives are adhered
to and its results are implemented correctly. Additional measures are proposed to further
improve the environmental impact of forest management planning.

7.   PROTECTIVE, TOURIST AND CULTURAL USE OF FOREST
7.1  Existing conditions
Mountain forests, such as the forests of the Laboratory Zone, exert a protective function
against natural hazards (such as avalanches, landslides, rock falls, erosion, etc.) and this
was recognized in the traditional forest management plans, according to which all forests
were classified as protective forests of some kind. Cutting restrictions were imposed
depending on the forest conditions, but these limitations have not been stated explicitly,
which is one of the main reasons why the traditional management plans have been criticized
by opponents.
In the model land-use plan for the Oni district (1998-99), forests have also been classified
according to 3 types of protection zones:
Table 7.1 Surface of forest according to types of protection zones
Type of protection                                                Area
(ha)          (%)
Close resort forest                                       11.638          16.7
Distant resort forest                                     56.543          81.1
Green belt around the town of Oni                           1.508          2.2
Total                                                     69.689         100.0
In relation with these types of protection, a number of cutting restrictions have been listed
depending on the present legislation and technical norms. No forest with soil protection and
water regulation functions was identified. This data do not give any indication on the area
where the protective function is the prevailing function of a forest.
As for the tourist and cultural uses related to the forests, they are enumerated and described
in more or less details and their potential value is recognized in relation with the revival of
tourism in the region (see Figure 16).
The non-monetary value of the role of forests for the protection against natural hazards of the
existing infrastructure (roads, bridges, buildings) and for tourist and cultural uses has not
been evaluated. It is probably much higher than the timber revenues.
7.2  Impact analysis and mitigation measures
Issue 17: Notion of prevailing functions
Forests exert different functions at the same time and place. According to the concept of
multiple uses, forests should be managed in such way that all functions are maintained and,
at best, maximized. Only in special cases a function is exclusive (examples are Protected
Areas dedicated only to the protection of some ecosystem, or a forest protecting directly a
road against avalanches).
Mountain forests, such as the forests of the Laboratory Zone, exert protective, production
and social functions to a different extent. It is the task of land-use planning to determine the

prevailing function of a particular forest and to decide the measures to be taken to enhance
the prevailing function and to take into account the secondary functions.
Mitigation measures 17:
17.1 The notions of multiple uses and of prevailing functions should be
incorporated in the Forest Code and, particularly, in the Regulations for
Allocating Territories (art. 21 al. 7).
Additional measure 17:
17.2 As an example, the Oni land-use plan should be complemented,
incorporating the notions of multiple use and prevailing functions. Forests
should be classified according to their prevailing function. For instance, the
location and extend of protective forests (forests with a prevailing protective
function) would be determined. The resulting "Multifunctional plan" would be
of great help for resolution of land-use conflicts and would also be used as
a planning tool for the forest management plan.
Issue 18: Management of protective forests
The management of protective forests is not defined in the Forest Code. It only specifies
activities that are forbidden under certain conditions.
In order to avoid erosion the normative acts prohibit the following activities:
*  final felling on the slopes with an inclination of more than 350;
*  logging with skidders on the slopes with an inclination of more than 300;
* damaging more than 15% of upper soil layer of entire cutting area.
The normative act forbids final felling in forests with soil protection and water regulation
functions, such as:
* sub-alpine zone's natural habitat having the width of 300 m;
* forest line located within 200 m from permanent snow beds, avalanches and
flooding;
protective forest areas located within 300 m from the banks of rivers, seas, lakes,
water reservoir and water canals;
*  protective forest lines located within 100 m from steep slopes, landslides, and
Karst objects; and in forest areas located within 1 km radius of mineral springs.
Some of these interdictions will have negative impacts. For instance, it should be possible to
cut trees on river banks, in order to reduce the volume of wood that will be washed away
during floods and that may damage bridges and river works.
In order to mountain or enhance the various functions of the forests, they must be treated
accordingly. Trails and roads must be maintained, and, in case of danger, works to prevent
natural hazards or to repair damages must be undertaken. For example, in forests, which
directly protect a road against snow avalanches, particular silvicultural measures (such as
selective cutting to improve the stability of the forest stands) must be taken at a cost to be
128

supported by the State. Cost estimates do not exist for these protective measures at the
regional level.
Forest improvement activities (including sanitary felling and "reconstructive" felling) are used
(or are viewed by outsiders) as a means to carry out illegal felling in protection forests.
Mitigation measures 18:
18.1 The definition of forests with prevailing protective function is to be included
in the Forest Code and in normative acts.
18.2 Normative acts must be developed to better define and incorporate
silvicultural measures and maintenance activities in protective forests (so
called forest improvement activities).
18.3 The planning and implementation of protective measures must be
incorporated in the Forest Management Information System.
18.4 Training in forest management planning should be extended to training in
silviculture of mountain forests, including the planning of silvicultural
measures for protective forests. Such training could rely on experiences
from Europe (Austria, Bavaria, Italy, Switzerland).
Issue 19: Management of forests with tourist or cultural functions
Forests with prevailing tourist or cultural functions must be managed according to these
goals and appropriate measures must be taken. For instance, in forests surrounding a
historic building, trees may have to be cut to protect the building from tree shade or to
prevent the risk of accidents (such as falling of branches) for visitors. Such measures (and
their funding by the State) may be accounted for in the new Forest Code and in existing
norms, but no State funds have been allocated for such measures.
Mitigation measures 19:
19.1 Forests with prevailing tourist or cultural functions will have to be
determined and incorporated in the planning process.
19.2 Tourist and cultural uses in the forests will have to be coordinated with
those to be implemented in the protected areas.
19.3 Maintenance of trails and other tourist and cultural infrastructure is to be
financed on cost-sharing basis with the Protected Areas Development
Project.
7.3  Significance of impacts after implementation of mitigation measures
Inclusion of the notions of multiple uses and of prevailing functions can only improve the
quality of planning and of management of the forests.
Addition of considerations of protective measures and maintenance of tourist and cultural
infrastructures (to be financed on a cost-sharing basis with the PADP) will provide an
additional dimension to the FDP.

Forests cover most of the Laboratory Zone below the alpine zone up to 80% of the territory
(56% on the whole).

Mountain forests are presently exploited (as a green mine) in an extensive way for the
extraction of various wood and non-wood products. Defective or dying trees are harvested in
small quantities and scattered places (so called sanitary cuts) in forests accessible by
tractors. Firewood is collected by individuals near villages and roads. Commercial harvesting
operations make up officially less than 10% of the wood harvested.

The official figures of harvested wood in the Laboratory Zone as a whole (44'043 m3 in year
2000, or less than 0.2 m3/ha/year) are low and much inferior to the allowable cut (by 57%)
and represent less than a tenth of the volume growth, as calculated in the forest
management plans (481'000 m3 or 1.8 m3/ha/year, itself a conservative growth estimate).

Volume cut in year 2000 (official permits)      44'000 m3               0.17 m3/ha/year
Contrary to the popular belief, according to these figures, the forests are underused with
regard to wood harvesting and the growing stock should be on the increase. Poor harvesting
techniques are to be blamed for the local degradation of forest conditions, for soil erosion on
steep slopes and for soil compaction. In addition, illegal wood cutting (wood harvested
without official permit) occurs in various ways and places. Extent of these illegal activities is
not officially documented (with estimates for the Laboratory Zone varying from a low 3'500 m3
to unsubstantiated claims as high as 100'000 m3 per year)26.
Non-wood forest products are varied and abundant in the Laboratory Zone.

8.2  Impact analysis and mitigation measures
Issue 20: Illegal cuffing operations
Although it is presently impossible to quantify the ongoing illegal cutting operations, they
certainly have a negative economic incidence (in terms of lost revenues for the State and lost
income for the local wood industry) and a devastating impact on the image of State
institutions. Their environmental impacts are difficult to assess since these operations are of
clandestine nature. The main risk consists in the haphazard way the illegal logging
operations are carried out, the damage they may cause to the remaining stands and soil

erosion that may be started by the uncontrolled rolling and slipping of stems on steep slopes
and by the skidding spurs left by tractors.
Mitigation measures 20:
20.1 Monitoring of illegal cutting operations (see Chapter 13, Monitoring) must
be an integral part of the Forest Management Information System and its
application should have a first priority.
20.2. Penalties (fines) imposed on trespassers should be collected and the
revenues should be used for the restoration of forests damaged by illegal
cutting operations.
20.3. Eradication of large-scale illegal cutting operations has to be made a
condition of compliance for the IDA credit.
Issue 21: "Creaming" the forest
According to the law, all trees to be cut should be selected and marked by a forester with a
university degree. Due to financial restrictions, local foresters are often unable to check that
only the marked trees are harvested and that the best trees are not removed in the place of
their competitors. Creaming the forest of its best elements is the cause of a financial loss for
the forest owner and genetic impoverishment in the long run. If it is coupled with a weakening
of the stand stability, it may also diminish its protective functions.
Mitigation measure 21:
21.1 The State must pay correctly its personnel and give them the means to
carry out their supervisory duties.
Issue 22: Sanitary cuts
Sanitary cuts, removal of defective, dead or weakened trees, make up half of the volume of
the wood harvested in the Laboratory Zone. In managed forests, sanitary wood removals
usually amount to less than 20% of the total volume cut. Some of the sanitary cuts may be
disguised commercial cuts in zones where they are forbidden.
Mitigation measure 22:
As for issue 21.
Issue 23: Enhancement of biodiversity through silvicultural measures
Most of cutting activities takes place in accessible locations, which make up only a very small
proportion of the forests. In addition, according to the Forest Code, woodcutting is prohibited
in different zones, according to a number of criteria (such as slope of more than 350) and in
protected areas. The forest area that could be sustainably managed could be rather limited
(between 10 and 30 % of the forest area).
Experience elsewhere in Europe has shown that specific measures (including wood cutting)
should be taken to maintain or enhance the presence of light demanding species and
species with particular ecological needs (such as pioneer species). Further discussion on the

interactions between logging, biodiversity and landscape is given in Paragraph 2.4
Biodiversity.
Mitigation measure 23:
23.1 The provision of wood cutting measures for biodiversity enhancement must
be incorporated in the forest and in the protected areas management plans.
Issue 24: Improved economic utilization of forest resources and improved supply of
forest products to the regional economy
Improved forest management, opening-up of hitherto inaccessible forests thanks to the
construction of new access roads and the use of skyline transport systems will improve the
economic utilization of the forests of the Laboratory Zone by increasing harvest levels in a
sustained way and educing wood wastage.
Different investment strategies (based on low-impact road construction and logging systems
and appropriate silvicultural measures) can be devised to utilize the growth potential of the
forests in a sustainable way (see table 8.5).

forests) based on 3 different road investment and silvicultural strategies

Growth potential (rounded)              m3/year     160'000      210'000    230'000
Short definition of the 3 roads investment and silvicultural strategies:
(1) Concentration of road investments and silvicultural activities on the sites with the
best growth potential (1 0% of the forest area), using skidding and skyline systems;
(2) An additional 10% of the productive forests is brought under sustainable
management using skyline systems;
(3) Road investments are extended to forests of lesser fertility to open-up 30% of the
forests (in combination with long range skyline systems).
These figures illustrate the gap between present official harvest level (44'000 m3 in year
2000), the annual allowable cut (110'000 m3 for the Laboratory Zone) and the growth
potential of the more productive forests under sustainable forest management (between
1 60'000 and 230'000 m3 depending on the assumptions).
The forest management plans to be prepared for the four districts of the Laboratory Zone will
serve as a basis to determine the growth potential of the forests more precisely and fix the
annual allowable cut under sustained forest management. Assuming that illegal cutting was

ACTA Consultants                                          Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
brought under control, total wood harvest could be increased manifolds on a sustained basis
(from a volume of 44'000 m3 in year 2000).
The increased wood supply could benefit the local and regional economy in the form of
additional employment on the forests and in the wood industry and thanks to additional
profits from the sales of wood and wood products. These benefits are especially important for
an economically weak region with limited employment possibilities.
Mitigation measures 24: No mitigation measure is needed.
Additional measures 24:
24.1 A substantial part of the additional forest revenues should be allocated to
the local communities for their own use (subject to controls by the central
State).
24.2 Another portion of the additional revenues shall be dedicated to financing of
local forest activities as prescribed in the management plans (tree
plantations, cleaning and tending operations, road and trail maintenance,
etc.).
8.3  Significance of impacts after implementation of mitigation measures
Negative impacts will be eliminated, if the mitigation measures are implemented.
A positive impact on the biodiversity can be achieved thanks to specific silvicultural
measures. In addition, an improved utilization of the forest resources will have positive
impact.

9.  INFRASTRUCTURE AND WOOD HARVESTING SYSTEMS
9.1  Existing conditions
Infrastructure (roads, buildings) and wood harvesting systems (skidders, skyline ropeways,
trucks, chainsaws, etc.) used for tending and harvesting the forest resources of the
Laboratory Zone are rudimentary and in acute need of repair and maintenance. The same is
true for the main district roads connecting towns in the valleys. Some buildings have not
been repaired since the earthquake of 1991 in Oni.
The basic road network consists of access roads in the valleys and secondary roads
connecting villages and hamlets in the hills. Total length of existing forest roads is estimated
as 750 km, corresponding to a very low road density (2.7 m/ha forests on the average). No
detailed road inventory is available and road distribution over the area is very uneven. Many
lateral valleys are road less and large forest blocks have no road access. In final felling
areas, a dense network of skidding roads and trails exists with an estimated density of 50
m/ha. Most of the roads in the final felling areas are not maintained after completion of the
final cuts. Skidding trails often have not been laid out systematically and are often only
temporary, erosion prone tracks. There are no long (more than 100 m) skidrows in Lab Zone.
Existing skidrows cause new erosion processes or increase already existing ones. Trade-off
between more roads and shorter skidrows depends on relief, access and particular case.
Trees are felled with chainsaws, with little regard for the safety of the forest workers. No
statistics are available on injuries and casualties in the forest sector. Old agricultural tractors
are used for skidding. No skyline ropeways are available and logs are rolled or left sliding on
steep slopes, damaging the soil and standing trees, and causing an important wood
wastage.
The Forests Development Project would finance a demonstration program of low-impact
harvesting and transportation systems, as well as a forest road rehabilitation (190 km in the
Laboratory Zone) and construction (40 km) program, using equipment and construction
methods minimizing the impact on sensitive landscapes and ecotypes. Training in use of
environment-friendly road construction equipment and of harvesting systems will be
financed.
9.2  Impact analysis and mitigation measures
Issue 25: Need for a general plan and detailed plans of road rehabilitation and
construction activities
Rehabilitation of existing roads in the Laboratory Zone and construction of new forest roads
is a precondition for the sustained management of mountain forests. Without a minimum
network of access roads, forest management cannot be sustained: supervision activities
cannot be carried out efficiently, forest tending operations remain restricted to a small
proportion of forests and harvesting operations limited to the few accessible forests. The use
of skyline ropeways for wood transport may well enlarge the area where logging may be
carried out periodically (replacing secondary roads and skidding trails), nevertheless a
minimum of additional access roads and log landings will be needed.
Mountain road construction may have negative impacts on sensitive mountain sites, on the
fauna and landscape. It requires therefore coordination with other activities, careful planning
and appropriate construction methods. The impact of road construction on biodiversity and
landscape is discussed in Chapter 10, Biodiversity and Landscape. Other potentially
damaging impacts are discussed below.

National Forests Development Project
Mitigation measures 25:
25.1 Before laying out new roads, a Regional Road and Harvesting System Plan
must be designed, incorporating the results of the land-use and of forest
management plans (in addition to other pertinent data, such as
geotechnical maps, maps of natural hazards and of protected areas). The
regional plan will indicate where new access roads can be built, where
harvesting with skyline systems is feasible and which zones should be left
road less. Preliminary cost estimates will be used for costbenefit analysis.
Investment priorities will be determined for different forests according to
their growth potential, value of forest products and harvesting costs. The
Regional Plan would be subject to an EIA.
25.2 Road stretches that have been included in the regional plan will have to be
laid out in details on both map and ground. A detailed road project will be
prepared, including proposals for alternative designs and layouts. Detail
planning will take into account all factors having an incidence on risks of
erosion and visual impact on the landscape (slope of the terrain and road
inclination, geotechnical characteristics, problems of stream crossings,
management of surface, water, etc.). Total road costs (construction costs
plus maintenance costs) will be computed. The best proposal would show
the lowest cost/benefit ratio and the smallest risks. According to law, for
each road project (renewing, rehabilitation or creation) an EIA shall be
submitted to the Ministry of Environment.
25.2 Construction standards will be adapted to the severe weather conditions of
the Central Caucasus, in order to minimize future maintenance costs and
risks of damages to roads and the environment.
Issue 26: need for environmentally friendly equipment and construction methods
The most important causes of environmental concern are:
e  tipping excess cut material down the slope and dumping it on ecologically sensitive
sites such as swamps, riversides, etc.;
*  careless rock blasting: damages to the vegetation, risk of subsequent rock falls;
*  risk of soil erosion: often due to uncontrolled release of surface waters on unstable
slopes;
*  impacts on downstream water quality;
*  destruction of nesting and reproduction grounds.
In extreme cases, careless road construction activities in Georgia and elsewhere have
provoked irreversible damages such as landslides, flush floods, etc. On the other hand,
assuming that roads have been properly planned and laid out, adverse environmental
impacts of road construction can be minimized by using equipment and construction
methods adapted to the particular conditions, at an additional cost that must be included in
the economic analysis of the projected road.
Mitigation measures 26:
26.1 In zones with too steep slopes or/and instable geological conditions, no
roads shall be built.
136



ACTA Consultants                                        Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
26.2 Use of explosives shall be restricted. Conditions such as specialized staff
with permits to use explosive will be defined. Training on the adequate
explosive quantities will be useful.
26.3 The management of cut material will be planned and optimized at the
detailed planning phase of a road. During detailed planning, several
alternative road locations are studied to look for the best adaptation to the
relief and geology.
26.4 Excess cut material must be transported to the planned earth dumps
located on safe grounds.
26.5 Low impact construction equipment, such as backhoe shovels and
percussion hammers (Montabert hammers) will be required. Bulldozers
shall not be used and traxcavators shall be restricted to truck loading.
Earthworks are to be performed by backhoe shovels (shovel excavators).
26.6 Environmentally conscious contractors using skilled machine operators will
be given preference.
26.7 Best management practices for environmental impacts from road
construction will be incorporated in the technical specifications for the
request of bids and for road construction contracts.
26.8 Road construction will be supervised by qualified engineers trained in
environmentally friendly road construction methods.
26.9 The State Department of Forest Management shall periodically inspect the
construction sites and report to the FSDC if important project modifications
occur and if recommended mitigation measures have not been carried out.
Issue 27: Need for the proper use of harvesting systems
Construction (40 km) and rehabilitation (190 km) of forest roads in the Laboratory Zone,
together with the use of skyline harvesting systems will make possible to harvest increased
volume of wood, thereby increasing the risk of adverse environmental impacts (increased soil
compaction, increased soil erosion and sedimentation, damages to standing trees, etc.). It is
presently not known where increased harvesting will take place and therefore impossible to
make specific site recommendations. On the other hand, mobile and semi-mobile skyline
systems, if properly used, can contribute to reduction of soil compaction and soil erosion,
since wood can be transported off the ground and wood wastage can be diminished.
Mitigation measures 27:
27.1 Best management practices for minimizing environmental impacts of
harvesting systems will be incorporated in the technical specifications of a
wood permit. They shall include, among others, the following conditions:
* Harvesting operations must be planned in details (choice of cutting
area, observance of felling direction, distance between cable lines,
location of landings, etc.). They should be coordinated with wood
marking and subsequent log transport.
* Skidding operations shall be stopped under adverse atmospheric
conditions to avoid soil compaction and waterlogging. Deep skidding
spurs must be leveled out.

27.2. The local Forestry Department shall periodically inspect harvesting sites
and report irregularities.
Issue 28: Improved economic utilization of forest resources and improved supply of
forest products to the regional economy
The improved road infrastructure and use of low-impact harvesting systems will have positive
impacts on the economic utilization of the forest resources of the Laboratory Zone and
supply of forest products to the regional economy. Additional employment opportunities and
profits would result. These benefits are especially important for an economically depressed
region with limited employment possibilities. For further discussion, refer to Chapter 8, Forest
products.
9.3  Significance of impacts after implementation of mitigation measures
Construction of forest roads in the mountainous conditions of the Laboratory Zone
constitutes the largest risk of negative impacts on the environment that could be caused by
the project. However, the construction of 40 km of roads can be achieved with a minimum of
short-term nuisances and long-term negative impacts, if the planned activities and the
recommended mitigation measures are implemented. The positive socioeconomic benefits
are large enough to justify the investment in road construction, in conjunction with the
rehabilitation of 190 km of existing forest roads and the operation of low-impact harvesting
systems.
Remaining negative impacts (on the scenery for instance) will have to be explained to the
public in the broader context of sustained regional development.

10.  BIODIVERSITY AND LANDSCAPE
10.1 Existing conditions
Biodiversity
Thanks to the diversity of the natural conditions (altitude, exposition, soils, water availability)
characteristic to this mountainous region, the Central Caucasus represents home for many
species of flora and fauna. Its intermediary position between the Black Sea climate and dry
continental climate confers a particularly interesting ecological value to the region. According
to previous studies, flora of the Racha-Lechkhumi region includes about 1'200 species of 490
genus and 106 families. 272 species are endemic, out of which 110 are endemic to the
Caucasus. 54 are endemic species to Georgia and 9 are endemic to the Racha-Lechkhumi.
Considering the complexity of the micro-relief, it can be assumed that the intraspecific
diversity is high, but no data is available. The area of virgin forests in the Oni district can be
estimated at 9'000 ha. In total, in 4 districts, it may range at about 30'000 ha (see previous
reports).
Biodiversity is an important asset for the development of tourism in the Laboratory Zone.
Existing reports shows lack of solid data on fauna. Nevertheless, indices show decreases in
large mammals populations due to poachers, and some of them must now be considered as
endangered. Considering plant species used for "non-wood products" (fungi, berries,
medicinal plants, etc.) evaluation of human pressure is not possible on the basis of available
information.
The present forest use patterns have complex, both positive and negative impacts on the
biodiversity. It is hereby important to underline the difference between deforestation and
logging (see List of Acronyms and Termninology). Deforestation, a process that would
constitute one of the severest threats to biodiversity, is nowadays hardly to be found in the
Laboratory Zone. In the contrary, the total forest area is probably increasing in the region.
In comparison to forests where no logging would take place, the woodcuts (legal and illegal)
contribute to create a higher diversity of habitats. Through the felling of appropriate trees,
solar light and heat reaches the soil, which enables pioneer and light dependant plants to
develop. A higher diversity of insect species can be found on open areas (e.g. after a larger
cut) than in a closed forest. Generally speaking, the present woodcuts probably contribute to
a higher level of biodiversity than a "no cut" alternative. This might be called in question if the
woodcuts were followed by increased grazing or agriculture.
On the other hand, logging and logging related activities may have negative impacts on
biodiversity, depending on their extent, location and the techniques used. The present
precise impact is difficult to evaluate. The present use of firewood probably does not
significantly contribute to a loss a biodiversity, since its level is not excessive and is
concentrated around settlements. At the utmost, a change of the habitat can be feared if
selected tree species are systematically cut or promoted. Felling of old, dry trees has a
negative impact on some insect, fungus and bird species. Concerning the commercial timber
extracting activities, more important impact can be assumed, due to the fact that those
activities sometimes happen in relatively untouched areas and often induce severe soil
damages.

ACTA Consultants                                           Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
Landscape
Landscape27 is another important asset for tourism and the forests constitute an essential
element of it in the Laboratory Zone. Important here are the evolution of the forest area
(deforestation versus forest increase), the species composition, the structure of edges and
the presence of small woodlands (hedges, tree lines, etc.).
Generally speaking, any logging of significant extent will leave visible marks, if temporary.
Even if conducted in a most careful way, a wood cut cannot let the picture unchanged.
However, visible changes in the landscape occur in a natural evolution too, sometimes even
dramatically in case of storms or avalanches. In mountain areas, human activities have the
most visible impacts on steep slopes, since they can be seen from the distance, and in
winter, when snow accumulates in skyline trenches, in clear cuts and on road banks.
Nowadays, as far as it could be observed in the field trips, wood-extracting activities have a
small impact on the landscape. Commercial logging can hardly be seen around tourist
resorts and main roads.
In the Laboratory Zone, the Forests Development Project will support the implementation of
forestry regulations, support efficient and participatory planning and promote private sector
participation in sustainable forest management. The latest component includes a 'privately-
run demonstration program of improved, low-impact harvesting and transportation systems"
as well as forest road construction.
The previous study "Over-all Forest Utilization Program for the Oni District" implemented in
the framework of the FDP has already addressed landscape related issues and created
"Landscape-Ecological Carcass for the region". It is planned to implement similar studies in
other regions of the Lab Zone. Therefore, SEA does not duplicate already existing
information.
10.2 Impact Analysis and Mitigation Measures
Issue 29: biodiversity, landscape and planning, legal and enforcement improvements
The development of improved inventory techniques and adequate participatory planning can
have a positive indirect impact on biodiversity and landscape. The improvements of laws and
their enforcement will have a positive indirect impact on biodiversity and landscape (see
corresponding Chapters 3 and 4).
Mitigation measure 29:
No supplementary mitigation measure is needed
Issue 30: road construction and poaching
According to the baseline information existing in draft reports, some large mammal species
are now concentrated in remote areas or sanctuaries. Road building for the purpose of
logging will create an easier access for poachers to habitats protected by their remoteness.
Road construction will thus increase the risk of poaching of large mammals, some of which
are endangered. Could, on the other hand, new roads allow a better control and protection
by the Hunting Service? Probably not in a large extent, as difficulty to access to remote
27a landscape . is used here in its narrow sense, meaning the visible, aesthetic dimensions of natural and human formations (it is not used in its
broad sense which would include the biodiversity dimension)
140



ACTA Consultants                                          Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
sanctuaries may not be the main factor hindering the Hunting Service from enforcing hunting
laws.
Mitigation measures 30:
30.1 During the regional forest road planning phase, which shall precede any
particular construction (or/and during the EIA, see Chapter 9,
Infrastructure), places which serve as sanctuary for large mammals must
be situated. They shall be avoided by future road construction.
30.2 The opportunity to close forest roads to non-authorized persons will be
evaluated28.
Issue 31: road construction and change of habitats
Road construction may disturb habitats through drainage of humid zones and improper
disposal of excavation materials. Crossing humid zones does not only make road
construction hazardous, but also very expensive. Drainage, which is necessary to a certain
extent, will disturb the habitat. Vegetation specialized on sphagnum-swamps, for example, is
particularly sensitive to changes in the water level. Changes in the vegetation and in the soil
structure will eventually change the habitat quality for insects and birds. The use of low-
impact construction standards is not yet guaranteed (see Chapter 9, Infrastructure).
Mitigation measures 31:
31.1 At the stage of detailed planning of a new road, different locations must be
evaluated on the basis of the impact on humid biotopes. This may be part of
the EIA of construction projects.
31.2 Prescriptions about drainage in humid biotopes must be defined.
31.3 Road construction standards will be established. They will include
guidelines about the equipment to be used for road building.
Issue 32: road construction, skylines and landscape
Due to the geological and topographical conditions found in the Laboratory Zone, landscape
protection will be very sensitive issue for road building. Visible impact of road construction
can hardly be avoided in mountainous areas; it can nevertheless be more or less severe and
long lasting. The tipping of excavation material down the slopes would have the most severe
impact on the landscape. This risk will be high if bulldozers are used instead of modern
backhoe shovel excavators and if explosives are improperly used.
The impact of skyline harvesting on the landscape depends on several factors:
*  the type of wood cut: a clear cut will be more visible than a passage cut; the latest
can remain nearly unnoticed in good conditions. Skylines enable passage cuts, the
question is whether the logging company is ready to preserve the remaining stand.
*  the width of skyline trenches; a high precision during the tracing in the field is
necessary. If layout is approximate, many trees should be felled to be able to
install the cable; it will cause appearance of a large trench.
28
Nowadays, there is a practice of cdosing forest roads by means of tumpike and trenches.
141

National Forests Development Prolect
*   the direction of the skyline: skyline following the biggest slope are more visible
than oblique lines. Furthermore, oblique lines generate fewer damages to the
remaining trees.
*   the combination of line height and log length: in the Laboratory Zone, downhill
harvesting will be most frequent, since existing and new roads will probably lay at
the bottom of the valleys. If the logs are longer then the line height, downhill
harvesting will generate high damages to the trees along the trench, since they will
be knocked by harvested logs. To minimize impact on the landscape, harvesting of
relatively short logs is recommended.

See under the issue Need for environmentally friendly equipment and construction methods
in Chapter 9 Infrastructure.
The impacts of potential wood extracting activities made possible by the construction of new
roads are discussed in the Chapter 8, Forest products.

10.3 Significance of Impacts after Implementation of Mitigation poaching
Generally speaking, landscape, in its esthetical dimension, will be more sensitive than
biodiversity to forestry activities (logging, road construction, use of new harvesting system).
During management and construction planning, zones with prevailing landscape-protection
function, such as stands around villages and resorts, will deserve a particular attention.
Logging will anyway change the landscape in some extent, even if only in the short run.
Authorities will have to decide what is the acceptable immediate impact on the landscape,
depending on the prevailing forest function.
An increase in the logging volume, with the present harvesting techniques, would have the
worse impact on the landscape. The multiplication of hazardous skidding trails constructed
by logging companies for one particular cutting area would furthermore promote erosion.
Logging in a sustainable extent might increase habitat diversity and, indirectly, potentially
increase the diversity of animal and plant species.
Considering the present situation, poaching will probably continue and the construction of
roads in remote areas will increase the pressure on hunted species. Biodiversity would be
severely affected by forestry activities if they induce deforestation, but this eventuality is
unlikely to take place in the Laboratory Zone.

11. SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT
11.1 Existing conditions
The concept of "Sustainable Development" has become widely accepted on the international
policy level. Some definitions put the emphasis rather on its growth aspect, such as:
economic growth that benefits present and future generations without adversely affecting
biological and other natural resources29. Others rather underline the social and environmental
dimensions: improving the quality of human life while living within the carrying capacity of
supporting ecosystem30. The concept of "Sustainable Forest Management" enjoys similarly a
global consensus on the general policy level.
It appeared quite soon that more precise definitions are necessary, which take into account
the diversity of situations. Different international processes are attempting to settle precise
"criteria and indicators" to assess the country's own situation and improvements. The
discussions lead in the Montreal Process, which dealt with temperate and boreal forests,
may be of interest for Georgia. The 7 criteria used in the Montreal Process were used as a
framework to gather the data on which the present study is based. Indicators, taking into

important too. A detailed definition and analysis of all potential indicators for each criterion
could be the aim of further studies.

11.2 Impact Analysis and Mitigation Measures
For the Laboratory Zone, data discussed in other chapters of the present study give clues for
most of the criteria. The issues representing the main challenges for sustainable forest
management have been explained in those chapters and are not repeated here, except one
additional issue:
Issue 33: definition of sustainable forest management
Elaborating an operational definition of sustainable forest management would be interesting.
The elaboration of a set of criteria and indicators adapted to Georgia's specificities will help
to define which are the key data necessary for assessing the evolution of Georgia's forests
over several decades. To enable international comparativeness, adequate reference "criteria
and indicators" should be selected. The criteria and indicators defined for the present study
are given as an example.
The elaboration of a set of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management,
involving representative of the civil society, could be integrated in the process of elaboration
of a global national forest monitoring system.
11.3 Significance of Impacts after Implementation of Mitigation Measures
A transparent policy dialogue on criteria and indicators suited to assess sustainable forest
management in Georgia would promote public awareness in a sustainable valorization of
natural resources.

12. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN FOREST MANAGEMENT AND GENDER ISSUES
12.1 Existing conditions
As it was mentioned above, the Law on Environmental Protection states that everyone is
entitled to get in-time and precise information on the environment and to take part in the
environmental decision-making process. The Law on Environmental Permits establishes a
right of society to obtain information on the planned activity and its potential impact on the
environment.
Georgia ratified the Aarhus (Denmark, June 24, 1998) Convention Access to Infornation,
Public Participation in Decision Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters.
According to the Chapter X of the Forest Code, representatives of population and public
organizations have a right to:
a)  receive full, reliable and timely information on current condition of the State Forest
Fund;
b)  fully participate in the planning of forest management of the State Forest Fund
(Article 35.1).
Furthermore, State bodies competent for the management of State Forests shall publish the
following information before making a decision on forest use:
a) Forest Management Plan;
b) categories established for the State Forest Fund;
c) protection regime established for the State Forest Fund;
d) allocation of areas of the State Forest Fund for forest use for a period of five years
or longer (Article 35.2).
At present, no detailed procedure for ensuring public participation in decision-making
process exists.
Available reports do not mention any participation in the forest management planning which
occurred in the 90s in the Laboratory Zone. According to the social assessment, respondents
in Oni want to participate in forest management, but few had the. opportunity to do so. Almost
all residents claimed that no one from the national, State or commercial forest management
authorities had asked them for help or for their opinion. Although they believe that they must
participate in forest management, many do not know what could be their contribution. In
Lentekhi, 99,3% of population thinks that forest management authorities are not encouraging
their participation in forest management.
According to the social assessment, the people in the laboratory zone do not trust the
information received through official sources. Similarly, non-govemmental organizations
(NGOs) mostly do not trust the State bodies and official information. NGOs are quite
skeptical regarding government's ability to manage forests. In relation with NGOs activities
resulting in the destruction of job opportunities, part of the local population are quite
aggressive towards NGOs.
NGOs in Georgia cover a large variety of groups: local informal groups, semi-private
consultant offices belonging to officials, opportunist multi-active groups, well donated offices
of internationally active NGOs, etc. Organization related with the Church might be quite
powerful in some areas.
147

National Forests Development Project
Many male habitants of the Laboratory Zone collect fuel wood in the neighboring forests.
Wood constitutes nearly 100% of the energy consumption for cooking and heating. Access to
fuel wood is particularly important for the 50% of the population belonging to poor and middle
poor categories. Data on gender aspects are not available.
Environmental education
Despite the existing legal rights, public awareness, interest and participation of the
community in decision-making are not yet on a desirable level. One of the main reasons for
this is a poor system of environmental education as well as restricted access to
environmental information in the recent past. At present, there is no system of environmental
education in primary and secondary schools. Environmental disciplines are in the curricula of
some high and private secondary schools, however neither proper textbooks nor
appropriately trained trainers are available. There is no faculty of environmental legislation at
any high school, subsequently, no highly skilled lawyers trained in this field could be found.
Public Awareness
In conditions of limited funds, the government cannot provide systematic distribution of
environmental information through mass media and periodicals. The coverage of
environmental issues is limited and fragmented. There is more activity of NGOs in this
direction; however, since they rely mainly on foreign aid their activities are not stable.
* Public relations
Public Relation (PR) is a tool for public awareness. PR works best when an organization
commits to achieving specific several-year, annual, and shorter-term communication goals.
Aims of PR for the Forests Development Project should be the following:
*  to co-ordinate the internal and external two way communication concerning
forestry related issues;
*  to detect problems and address them  adequately in early stage for crisis
avoidance in the future;
*  to ensure fulfillment of Project objectives in the long term;
*  to be sure to keep everyone informed every step of the way and ensure
transparency of actions;
*  to ensure participating on ground;
*  to enhance the credibility of the Project.
In order to ensure sustainability and effectiveness of the Forests Development Project in long
term, considerable attention should be paid to public relation issues. Particularly:
*  FSDC together with the State Department of Forest Management must be in
charge of PR to ensure transparency of the project and easy access to the public
information.
*  FSDC together with the SDFM must identify PR objectives and develop a strategy
for PR. It should be considered that the best PR takes months to develop and then
improves over the years.
*  Based on strategy, FSDC and SDFM should develop detailed plan for PR and
identify committed staff to do the job.

Ways of PR:
*  Face-to-face meetings and interviews (most productive);
*  Phone interviews;
*  Mass mailings of releases;
* Opinion research to learn what the audience is really up against and where their
niche may be;
* Mass media (TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, etc.)

National Forests Development Project
As it was mentioned above, the Chapter X of the Forest Code provides articles regarding
public participation in the governance of the State Forest Fund. Article 36 provides the basis
for consideration of public comments prior the decision-making:
"Under conditions specified in Article 35, bodies authorized for managing the State Forest
Fund shall consider comments and suggestions made by citizens and representatives of
public organizations prior to making decisions."
* Public education and awareness
Recognizing the need for capacity building in the field of sustainable forest management,
public education and awareness are critical and central instruments to achieve the Project's
goals and to ensure effective implementation of the Project at the national and local levels.
Component B of the NFDP consists of strengthening forestry institutions and is composed of:
(i) restructuring I strengthening the SDFM and
(ii) carrying out priority research, education and public awareness programs.
Under thet base-case scenario used in this report, the SDFM would retain normative and
regulatory functions as well as carrying out forest management responsibilities/plans. After
the preparation of a reorganization plan, the NFDP would provide all the necessary technical
assistance, training and incremental logistical means (mainly building rehabilitation,
transportation, equipment/materials) for carrying out the plan over the remaining three years.
Priority research and education programs will be formulated on the basis of specific studies
conducted in the first year of the NFDP.
A separate study will be undertaken to design a promotion campaign aimed at raising public
awareness/knowledge about forestry matters - for instance, through the setting up of
seminars/workshops and the production/release of statistics, bulletins and posters. The
carrying out of the programs and campaign will be contracted to governmental and/or non-
governmental organizations selected through national bidding (possibly the MFRI, the State
Agrarian University and NGOs).
The applied research program will result in improved and more cost-efficient
techniques/methods for carrying out forestry operations. The education program will result in
a better supply of forestry professionals and technicians for hiring by the private and public
sectors. The public awareness campaign will result in improved knowledge/awareness by the
general public (particularly the decision-makers) about the economic and environmental
importance of the Georgian forests.
It should be considered that conservation and sustainable use of forest resources includes
social and economical issues which require cultural understanding and sensitivity, and efforts
to promote the goals of the Project entail recognition of the diverse needs of people and their
differing perceptions, knowledge, attitudes, interests, values and understanding. Public
education and awareness on sustainable forestry and biological diversity is most effective
when it occurs in a social context that is meaningful to a specific audience.
Public education and awareness issues should be integrated into and become an integral
component of all sectoral and thematic items under the program of work of the Project. For
these purposes, the FSDC together with the SDFM should:
* promote education on forestry and biodiversity matters through relevant
institutions, including non-governmental organizations;
150



ACTA Consultants                                        Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
* allocate appropriate resources for the strategic use of education and
communication instruments at each phase of policy formulation, planning,
implementation and evaluation, including the identification of relevant target groups
seeking to provide these with relevant, timely, reliable and understandable
information;
*  promote integration of sustainable forestry and biological diversity concerns into
education strategies, recognizing the particular needs of local communities; and
*  support initiatives by major groups that foster stakeholder participation in
sustainable use and that forest conservation matters into their practices and
educational programs.
*  engage themselves to share experiences on initiatives on public education and
awareness and public participation relevant to the Project, particularly on a
sectoral and thematic basis, and to make relevant case studies as well as lessons
leamed in the preparation of forestry management policies, strategies and plans
and for the exchange of information among other organizations and public through
the clearing-house mechanism and to consider how to organize assistance for
audience who may be keen to develop public awareness and education strategies,
but lack the ability to do so.
It is recommended that the SDFM makes use of the media, including print and electronic
media, to promote public education and awareness about the importance and appropriate
methods for the sustainable use and conservation of forests;
NGOs have an important role in developing and disseminating information on modern
forestry and environmental practices, especially in reaching out to the broad audience who
have a significant role to play in the forest conservation and sustainable use of natural
resources.
As it was written above, the WB is presently preparing the Protected Areas Development
Project, whose objectives, among others, are to: strengthen the institutions responsible for
biodiversity conservation programs, improve the public awareness of Georgian biodiversity,
and promote international cooperation in Transcaucasus biodiversity conservation. Since
project will interface with the NFDP in the Laboratory Zone, it is strongly recommended that
two World Bank Projects: NFDP and Protected Areas Development Project strongly
communicate and implement public environmental awareness campaigns with combined
efforts.
12.2 Impact Analysis and Mitigation Measures
Issue 34: promotion of public awareness in sustainable forest management through
participatory management planning for community and local forests.
The activity suggested for the Forests Development Project underlines that participation is a
way to shape public awareness. The community forestry issue is discussed in Chapter 5
Forest Ownership.
Mitigation measure 34: see Chapter 5.

ACTA Consultants                                         Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
Issue 35: participatory management planning for all forests
It must be noticed that participation responds to objectives, which go beyond the promotion
of public awareness. First, public participation to public decisions is in itself a fundamental
principle in a democracy. Participation in forest planning could thus be an interesting
empowerment exercise for a population whose comprehension of public management has
been strongly influenced by 8 communist decades and 1 near-anarchy decade. It would have
a didactic impact on officials and politicians too. Secondly, participation improves the general
planning efficiency. Conflicts can be managed or even prevented. Planning results are easier
to implement if stakeholders have taken part to the decisions.
Public participation is particularly necessary in the forest where fuel wood is collected.
Additional measures 35:
35.1 the management-planning model shall be completed with a participation
model. The opportunity and the forms of public participation to different
land-use and/or forest levels (local, regional, national) shall be studied.
35.2 the role of different NGOs shall be further analyzed. Experience shows that
the exclusion of powerful NGOs in the planning processes may facilitate the
planning activities but does not mitigate conflicts during implementation.
35.3 the participation model(s) shall take in account the public mistrust regarding
officials and NGOs.
Issue 36: forest management and gender issues
Gender issues shall be integrated in the Forests Development Project. The participation of
women to forest discussion might have positive social and environmental impacts.
Mitigation measures 36:
37.1 Gender issues shall be integrated in adequate form in policies and
activities.
12.3 Significance of Impacts after Implementation of Mitigation Measures
Public participation in forest decisions must be addressed for democratic and efficiency
reasons, even if it represents a challenge in post-Soviet period. Public participation will have
positive socioeconomic and environmental impacts if implemented with adequate approach
and instruments.

13   Monitoring and Management Plans Guidelines
13.1 Environmental Management Plan and Monitoring Guidelines
This chapter presents the environmental management plan guidelines, which have been
developed in response to the analysis of impacts given in the following Table 13.1.1. These
guidelines incorporate revealed ecological, social, geological, etc. cumulative impacts,
propose mitigation and monitoring measures to each of them and propose institutional roles
and responsibilities in relation to each of the mitigation and monitoring measures.
The environmental management plan guidelines developed for the different components of
the proposed Project are presented in the following tables. The following should be noted in
relation to each of the tables:
* The listed mitigation and monitoring activities are all discussed in details in the relevant
sections. All of the measures presented are considered essential for the effective
mitigation of potential environmental impacts from the proposed Project.
* Although responsibility for many of the monitoring and mitigation measures are assigned
to the FSDC, it is considered that overall responsibility for the overseeing and monitoring
of implementation of the environmental management plan of the Forests Development
Project and compliance of activities carried out in the framework of the Project with
national environmental standards and guidelines should lie with the MoE. A discussion of
how this could be effectively achieved by using the resources of the Project to support and
develop the capacity of the MoE to carry out its role in this respect, should be discussed
and considered in the future.
13.2 Environmental and Forest Monitoring
Since forest management planning already deals with the environmental matters related to
the forests and their use, it is proposed to renounce to a separate environmental
management plans for the Forests Development Project and integrate them in the Forest
Management Information System that will be developed by the project.
A monitoring system of Sustainable Forest Management consists of the collection and
analysis of data to assess the evolution of the overall forest situation, including
environmental and social aspects. A set of indicators shall be defined to monitor (i.e. to
measure) the state and evolution of the environment. As discussed in Chapter 11,
elaboration of a Georgian set of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management
based on internationally recognized criteria and indicators is suggested. The Criteria of the
so-called Montreal Process might be used as references; they include following topics, or
criteria:
A. Conservation of biological diversity;
B. Maintenance of productive capacity of forest ecosystems;
C. Maintenance of forest ecosystem health, vitality and protective function;
D. Conservation and maintenance of soil and water resources;
E. Maintenance and enhancement of long-term multiple socioeconomic benefits to meet
the needs of societies;
F. Legal, institutional and economic framework for forest conservation and sustainable
management.

ACTA Consultants                                         Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
Data collection
Data shall be collected through the combination of different methods:
* forest inventories: periodic collection of data in the field on temporary or permanent
sample plots;
* forest statistics: statistics on effective yields, regeneration areas, silvicultural
measures, finances;
* aerial and satellite imagery.
Data management system
Collected data will be part of the FMIS, which will allow the simultaneous monitoring of
social, economic and environmental impacts of forest use on a large scale (for instance in
the complete district). It is recommended to apply the GIS, prepared in the framework of the
present study for different kind of information (forest species, fauna, geology, etc.), in the
future as the basis for the implementation of the FDP.
With the application of above-mentioned set of Criteria and Indicators for sustainable forest
management, the required remedial measures could also be evaluated and the timing of their
implementation could be planned.
Monitoring of illegal wood cuts
After breakdown of the Soviet Union, due to economical and financial problems, no regular
forest monitoring was carried out. However, there is a past experience of monitoring, when
forest was monitored by rangers, foresters and hunters engaged by the State for control over
poaching. They had their routs, which was checked regularly. Methods of monitoring were:
log tracking, visual inspection, noise, etc.
Due to the controversy on illegal woodcuts and their potential damages to the environment,
economy and the image of the State, illegal cuts should be identified and quantified so that
trespassers can be prosecuted. In a first trial phase, reconnaissance flights with helicopters,
followed by field checks, should be used.
Since most of illegal woodcuts are of a diffuse nature (not typical clear cuts), an appropriate
monitoring technique should be devised. The results will be used to determine if satellite
imagery can be used later to monitor the illegal woodcuts. Remote Sensing could be the
viable tool for monitoring of forest resources.
Guidelines for integration of EIA into the Forest Management Planning System
Various Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) will be required at different planning levels
and at different project stages. In order to minimize costs and time delays and to avoid
duplication of efforts, it is essential that they are properly coordinated with forest planning
activities. The Forest Management Information System should be created and maintained in
such way that data needed for the implementation of particular EIA will be available in a
suitable format (for instance with the use of a GIS).
Land use and forest management planning
154



ACTA Consultants                                            Sectoral Environmental Assessment
National Forests Development Project
Land use plans will be prepared at the district level to deal with issues related with land uses
and their harmonization in a long-term basis. They should be subject to a complete EIA and
thorough public participation. Obviously, contents of EIA will depend on the particular study
issues. The authority responsible for the approval of land use plans should be composed of
representatives of various ministries and local authorities involved in land management and
protection.
Forest management plans will deal mainly with forest issues at the district level. They will be
based on the results of the land use plans. Therefore, a complete EIA should not be
necessary. The consistency of the forest management plan with the land use plan and
principles of multiple-use and sustained forest management will be the main issues to be
dealt by the EIA of the forest management plan.
General and detailed road planning
A general road plan should be prepared at the district level to decide where roads can be
constructed (or rehabilitated), with which priority and standards. This will be based on the
land use plans and, if available, on the forest management plans. The general road plan
would be subject to a complete road EIA and full public participation.
A detailed road project (dealing with one particular road stretch) would be subject to a partial
EIA, where the consistency with the general road plan will be checked and impacts, specific
to the particular road, will be assessed. A checklist of impacts to be assessed for this type of
road projects should be prepared in close collaboration with the Ministry of Environment.
Cutting permit
The delivery of a cutting permit should not be subject to an EIA. The Ministry of Environment
would check the consistency of the cutting permit with the indications of the forest
management plan.
Table 13.2.1: Tentative integration of EIA in planning activities
Planning level              Type of EIA                  Conditions
* Land Use Plans (LUP)      Intersectoral, integrated    Full public participation
* Forest Management Plan    Sectoral                     Compliance with LUP, sectoral
(FMP)                                                 public participation
* Cutting permit            Not necessary                Compliance with FMP
* General Road Planning     Integrated, detailed         Compliance with LUP and FMP,
(GRP)                                                 full public participation
* Detailed road planning    If necessary: partial        Strict compliance with GRP
In practice, it might occur that planning at the lower level (e.g. GRP) is realized before the
planning at higher level (e.g. LUP) is accomplished. In this case, it might be appropriate to
realize the environmental studies and the participatory procedures.

Issues                                       Mitigation and additional measures
Laws
1. Improving the forest legislation    1.1   To support the implementation of the 1999 Forest Code of Georgia; a simplification of this Code must be
considered. A streamlined Forest Code should be reduced to the principles, while enforcement issues will be
handled in the regulations.
1.2   Rules, which shall be declared void, should be listed and be declared annulled as soon as possible.
1.3   Missing regulations shall be issued by the responsible authorities. The coherence with other rules shall be
checked. For instance, regulations for long term planning of forest resources shall be created.
2. Contradictions between Laws,   2.1   Laws shall be analyzed and improved in order to clear overlapping competences and contradictions between
especially   overlapping   of        laws. If necessary, the Forest Code shall be improved taking into account all comments and conclusions made by
competences                          relevant governmental structures.
3. Tax   system    and   local   3.1   The Tax and Customs Code shall be changed to encourage development of alternative, environmentally safe
economic development                 industries based on the local use of forest resources.
4. Balance between sanctions for   4.1   Incentives shall be created for the law-enforcement agencies to implement sanctions on illegal actions.
illegal cutting and taxes for   4.2   Regarding taxes and fees for commercial logging, the foreseen reform of the forestry financial system must

9. Reorganization  of the State   9.1   An institutional reorganization plan will be prepared for strengthening the regulatory functions of the State
Department    of    Forest            Department of Forest Management, streamlining central and local planning and supervising capacities, and
Management of Georgia                 ensuring coordination with other line agencies.
9.1   The Forest Service must be trained on the implementation of updated legislation. It will be the opportunity to
disentangle the net of valid and void regulations. Innovative and participative training methods will be useful.
10. Improved    capacity    for   10.6  Participative training sessions and excursions on the issue of sustainable forest management shall be organized.
environmental management in           Sharing of experiences with selected countries might be useful.
the forest sector              10.7  Staff at key positions in the State Department of Forest Management shall be trained in matters of EIA. For most
of the staff, detail know-how on all aspects of EIA is probably not necessary.
10.8  Staff of the Department of State Ecological Examination and Environmental Permitting of the MoE and
independent experts reviewing the ElAs must be adequately trained in the assessment of activities proposed and
carried out in the field of forestry.
10.9  A database should be created in order to give experts access to information on methods and techniques used in
European countries.
10.10 The know-how of consulting companies in the field of EIA shall be recognized and improved for use in the forest
sector.
Forest ownership and liability
11. Privatization of forests       11.1  Existence of recent forest privatizations in Georgia shall be verified and documented. It will be important to
analyze them and to discuss which are the 'lessons learnt".
11.2  In a later phase, at most I or 2 tests could be implemented in low-conflict areas. Documentation and
transparency in all activities and decisions will be essential. Strict conditions for the realization of the tests shall
be defined, regarding, for instance, protective forests and biodiversity conservation. Liabilities and penalties in
case of legal violations shall be clearly stated before the beginning of forest use.
11.3  The clarification of the regulations defined for the State forests and which will remain valid in privatized forests
must be done. State bodies will have the competence and the duty to control their enforcement. It will be
necessary to underline that, against common understanding in Georgia, private ownership does not imply that the
owner can do anything he wants in his forests. Given this clarification and its implementation, the environmental
situation might not be worse in privatized test plots than it is the case presently.
12. Transfer of rights and liability   12.1  Definition of a legal status for local communities will be necessary.
on forests to local communities    12.2  International experiences in community forestry will be analyzed. Adaptation to Georgian post-soviet and
mountainous conditions is needed.
12.3  1 or 2 tests shall be studied in a well-chosen, 'low-conflict" area. An essential condition of success is a careful

support to the internal community organization and to the discussions between local communities and Forest
service. Much time and energy will be gained by taking international experiences in community forestry into
account.
12.5 The information activities foreseen for promoting public awareness in sustainable forest management should be
expanded to include information on the experiments in forest privatization and community forestry.
Forest Management planning
13. Scope    of   the   forest  13.1  The forest management information system should incorporate information on protected areas and vice-versa, so
management plans                    that data can be exchanged between the Forests Development and the Protected Areas Development Projects,
in order to facilitate coordination of two parallel projects and resolution of conflicts. In particular, the same
Geographical Information System (GIS) should be used by both projects.
14. Land use planning            14.1  The Forests Development Project and the Protected Areas Development Project shall agree on a common
methodology for land use planning, using the same classification criteria for allocating land to defined land uses,
taking into account the principles of multiple use of forests and agriculture and evaluation of the ecological and
economic values of the various ecosystems, using the notion of prevailing function (see chapter on "Protective
uses"). The same guidelines for land use planning should be used for these two projects.
14.2  The resulting land-use plans should be submitted to an Environmental Impact Assessment. Representatives of
the local population should be able to express their views at this stage. Remaining conflicts would have to be
resolved by the Central Caucasus Commission.
15. Need  of  EIA  for  forest  15.1  The consistency of management plans with multiple use and sustainable forestry could be evaluated by the
management plans                    Ministry of Environment without carrying out a full EIA. This simplification would be made possible by adapting
the legislation on EIA.
16. Technical  requirements  for   16.3  In addition to temporary sample plots, a sub-sample of permanent plots should be laid out in the whole
updating forest management          Laboratory Zone, as the starting basis for a modern National forest inventory for the whole country. This National
plans                               forest inventory will eventually provide reliable statistical information on the forest resources (such as changes in
the forest cover, volume trends, balance between growth and wood harvests), which are presently lacking and
badly needed for policy decisions at the State and regional levels.
16.4  Permanent sample plots and other monitoring means such as GIS will also be used for periodic monitoring (on a
5- to 10-years rotation) of environmental changes in the forest (and could be expanded to the protected areas).
Protective, tourist and cultural use
17. Notion of prevailing function  17.2  The notions of multiple use and of prevailing functions should be incorporated in the Forest Code and in
particular in the Regulations for Allocating Territories (art. 21 al. 7).
17.3  As an example, the Oni land-use plan should be complemented. incorporating the notions of multiple use and

National Forests Development Project
prevailing functions. Forests should be classified according to their prevailing function. For instance, the location
and extend of protective forests (forests with a prevailing protective function) would be determined. The resulting
"Multifunctional plan" would be of great help for the resolution of land-use conflicts and would also be used as a
planning tool for the forest management plan.
18. Management  of  protective   18.1  The definition of forests with prevailing protective function is to be included in the Forest Code and in normative
forests                               acts.
18.2  Normative acts must be developed to better define and incorporate silvicultural measures and maintenance
activities in protective forests (i.e. forest improvement activities).
18.3  The planning and implementation of protective measures must be incorporated in the Forest Management
Information System (FMIS).
18.4  Training in forest management planning should be extended to training in silviculture of mountain forests,
including the planning of silvicultural measures for protective forests. Such training could rely on experiences
from Europe (Austria, Bavaria, Switzerland).
19. Management of forests with   19.1  Forests with prevailing tourist or cultural functions will have to be determined and incorporated in the planning
tourist or cultural functions         process.
19.2  Tourist and cultural uses in the forests will have to be coordinated with those to be implemented in the protected
areas.
19.4  Maintenance of trails and other tourist and cultural infrastructures is to be financed on cost-sharing basis with the
Protected Areas Development Project.
Forest products Including illegal wood cuts
20. Illegal cutting operations     20.1  The monitoring of illegal cutting operations (see Chapter 13, Monitoring) must be an integral part of the Forest
Management Information System (FMIS) and have a first priority.
20.2  Penalties (fines) imposed on trespassers and the revenues used for the restoration of forests damaged by illegal
cutting operations should be collected.
20.3  Eradication of large-scale illegal cutting operations is to be made a condition of compliance for the IDA credit.
21. "Creaming" the forest          21.1  The State must pay correctly to its personnel and give them means to carry out their supervisory duties.
22. Sanitary cuts                  22.1  As for "Creaming": the State must pay correctly to its personnel and give them  means to carry out their
supervisory duties.
23. Enhancement of biodiversity   23.1  The provision of wood cuffing measures for biodiversity enhancement must be incorporated in the forest and in
through silvicultural measures        the protected areas management plans.
24. Improved economic utilization   24.1  A substantial part of the additional forest revenues should be allocated to the local communities for their own use

products  to  the  regoonal          the management plans (tree plantations, cleaning and tending operations, road and trail maintenance, etc.).
Infrastructure and wood harvesting systems
25. Need for a general plan and   25.1  Before laying out new roads, a regional road and harvesting system plan must be designed, incorporating results
detailed   plans   of  road          of the land-use and of forest management plans (in addition to other pertinent data, such as geotechnical maps,
rehabilitation and construction      maps of natural hazards and of protected areas). The regional plan will indicate where new access roads can be
activities                           built, where harvesting with skyline systems is feasible and which zones should be left road less. Preliminary cost
estimates will be used for cost/benefit analysis. Investment priorities will be determined for different forests
according to their growth potential, value of forest products and harvesting costs. The regional plan would be
subject to an environmental impact assessment.
25.2  Road stretches that have been included in the regional plan should be laid out in details on a map and on the
ground. A detailed road project will be prepared, including proposals for alternative designs and layouts. Detail
planning will take into account all factors having an incidence on risks of erosion and visual impact on the
landscape (slope of the terrain and road inclination, geotechnical characteristics, problems of stream crossings,
management of surface, water, etc.). Total road costs (construction costs plus maintenance costs) will be
computed. The best proposal would show the lowest cost/benefit ratio and the smallest risks. According to law,
for each road project (renewing, rehabilitation or creation) an EIA  shall be submitted to the Ministry of
Environment.
25.3  Construction standards will be adapted to the severe weather conditions of the Central Caucasus, in order to
minimize future maintenance costs and risks of damages to roads and the environment.
26. Need for environment-friendly   26.1  In zones with too steep slopes or/and instable geological conditions no roads shall be built.
equipment and  construction    26.2  The use of explosives shall be restricted. Conditions such as specialized staff with permits to use explosive will
methods                              be defined. Training on the adequate explosive quantities will be useful.
26.3  The management of cut material should be planned and optimized at the detailed planning phase of a road.
During detailed planning, several alternative road locations should be studied, to look for the best adaptation to
the relief and to geology.
26.5  Excess cut material must be transported to the planned earth dumps located on safe grounds.
26.5  Low impact construction equipment, such as backhoe shovels and percussion hammers (Montabert hammers)
will be required. Bulldozers should not be used and traxcavators should be restricted to truck loading. Earthworks
should be performed by backhoe shovels (shovel excavators).
26.6  Environmentally conscious contractors using skilled machine operators should be given preference.
26.7  Best environmental management practices for road construction should be incorporated in the technical

26.9  The State Department of Forest Management shall periodically inspect the construction sites and report to the
FSDC if important project modifications occur and if recommended mitigation measures have not been carried
out.
27. Need for the proper use of   27.1  Best management practices for minimizing environmental impacts of harvesting systems should be incorporated
harvesting systems                   in the technical specifications for the delivery of a wood permit. They shall include, among others, the following
conditions:
*  Harvesting operations must be planned in details (selection of cutting area, observance of felling
direction, distance between cable lines, location of landings, etc.). They should be coordinated with wood
marking and subsequent log transportation.
*  Skidding operations should be stopped under adverse atmospheric conditions, to avoid soil compaction
and water logging. Deep skidding spurs must be leveled out.
27.2  The local office of SDFM shall periodically inspect harvesting sites and report irregularities.

30. Road    construction    and   30.1  During the regional forest road planning phase, which shall precede any particular construction (orland during the
poaching                             EIA, see Chapter 9, Infrastructure), places which serve as sanctuary for large mammals must be situated. They
shall be avoided during future road construction.
30.2  Opportunity to close forest roads to non-authorized persons will be evaluated.
31. Road construction and change   31.1  At the stage of detailed planning of a new road, different locations must be evaluated on the base of the impacts
of habitats                          on humid biotopes. This may be part of the EIA of proposed construction projects. Prescriptions about drainage
in humid biotopes must be defined.

National Forests Development Project
14   Conclusions - Tentative Scenario Comparison
The Sectoral Environmental Assessment of the forest sector in the "Laboratory Zone" has
brought to light that the presence of forests is overwhelming and forests are increasing area
wise.
Forests are very diverse not only in their composition, structure and productivity (growth
potential and timber quality), but also in their functions (roles) and represent a shelter for a
rich biodiversity. If the forests were managed in an optimal way, they could have contributed
much more to the regional development by providing local employment, revenues for local
communities, wood energy for the local population, raw material for wood processing
industries as well as an attractive environment for the tourism, habitat for the wildlife and
protection from natural hazards.
As an example, more flexible management planning system concentrating wood production
on the best sites (sites with high growth potential and easy access) would make it possible to
increase greatly the allowable cut in a sustainable way, without impairing other functions of
the forests.
The present situation differs from the optimum:
forests are exploited in a haphazard way by the population for firewood and
selectively "creamed" by poachers for exportation of high quality timber, mainly to
Turkey. The extent of these illegal removals is unknown;
the silvicultural operations scheduled in the management plans are not carried out;
official forest revenues are sent to the central State Budget, without retaining a real
benefit for the local economy. Due to the lack of finances, forests are left untended,
buildings and roads are not adequately maintained, equipment is obsolete, salaries
are very low and often not paid and, as a consequence, foresters have to find other
means of subsistence.
ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES
14.1 "Existing project" scenario,,
The project development objective is to "establish Sustainable Forest Management Systems,
which would maximize the contribution of forests to economic development and rural poverty
reduction on an environmentally sustainable basis".
The project would support many positive measures for reforming the legal system and
financial and tax regulations. It would also support capacity-building of the State Department
of Forest Management, and, in the Laboratory Zone, development of improved forest
planning methods, improvement of silvicultural operations, rehabilitation, construction and
maintenance of roads needed for the implementation of the management plans, use of low-
impact cable-logging systems, plus various other useful measures such are: support to
improved forest pest protection, private sector involvement in non-timber forest products,
community forestry.
The "Existing project" addresses the right issues in the forest sector. It would contribute to
significant improvements of the socio-economic and environmental conditions of the forest
'Existing Project' as presented in the Project Summary (Prject-Summary-010130 doc February 13. 200t1

sector if the general conditions prevailing in Georgia were favourable for the sustainable and
fair management of renewable resources.
However, the severe economical crisis, the incapacity of State agencies to enforce laws and
the "quick money culture to be found at all levels in all sectors will probably continue for
some years. In this context, improving the management of forests is important, but one must
consider that:
objectives must remain modest,
project activities opening opportunities for increased logging might be misused to
unsustainable exploitation what is perceived to be a "mine" of wood.
14.2 "No project" scenario
Under the "No project" scenario, the Government of Georgia would not receive the loan from
the World Bank. As a result, it is assumed that none of the project components would be
implemented as planned.
The State Department of Forest Management would continue to exert some control over
forest uses with the limited means in its disposal. The forests would continue to expand area
wise, despite illegal cutting of firewood for local consumption and timber for exportation.
The local economy would benefit very little from the surrounding forests and the existing
infrastructure (roads, buildings, paths) would further deteriorate, making the region less
attractive for tourists.
The "No project" scenario is environmentally inferior to the "Existing project", since illegal
cutting will continue and the "creaming" of high value timber will cause a deterioration of the
genetic stock. Risks of erosion will be greater, because skidding trails could be built without
environmental considerations and maintenance. Damages to standing trees will be more
significant, since trees will be cut in a haphazard way. The "No project" scenario could be
considered as inferior due to the fact that in this case all the instruments for improving the
sustainability of forest management (regional land use plans, forest inventories, forest
management plans, general road plans, detailed road projects, ElAs, etc.) will not be
available.
The "No project" scenario is socially and economically inferior to the "Existing project" since
the potential contributions of the forest sector to the development of the regional economy
would remain minimal in terms of employment, revenues and supply of raw material for the
wood processing industries.
14.3 "Integrated Forest Development" scenario
The "Integrated Forest Development" scenario would take intersectoral relations into account
and concentrate on activities which provide employment opportunities and do not open the
doors to the misuse of the forest resources. A careful and participative land use planning
would provide the initial development framework.
An "Integrated Forest Development" as a tentative list of components would include:
1.  reduced intensity support to the forest management system, with emphasis on the
adequate tending of protective forests;
177



ACTA Consultants                                           SectoralEnvironmentai Assessment
National Forests Development Project
2.  support to local capacities for the rehabilitation of main roads and energy
infrastructures, since the difficult access to the valleys can be considered as one
of the main obstacles to the valorization of the local wood resources. Electricity
shortage makes local wood processing difficult;
3.  support to the tourism  sector, with priority on the rehabilitation of existing
infrastructure and marketing in Georgia and abroad, since ecotourism could create
local employment and added value with low negative environmental impact;
4.  selected support to livestock breeding, since grazing around villages exerts some
pressure on the forests and breeding concerns a high proportion of the population
in terms of occupation and subsistence.
Such scenario would enable the development of interesting synergies: improvement of the
road and electrical infrastructure can create employments and offer better conditions for the
tourism development; adequate tending of protective forests can produce some wood which
can be processed locally; protection of biodiversity, which would be supported by the
Protected Areas Development Project, can protect this important asset for tourism.
Given the present situation in the Laboratory Zone, such scenario offers better chances for
positive socio-economical and environmental conditions than a sectoral forestry approach.
The implementation of an integrated regional development requires cooperation of different
State agencies. The design and monitoring of the "Integrated land-use and forest
development" support project would require analysis competences and tools, which can be

GEORGIA
Forests Development Project (P044800)
PROJECT SUMMARY
The Project is proposed to be financed in 2002-2007 by an IDA credit of US$20 million. It is closely linked
and coordinated with the Protected Areas Development Project (GEF grant of US$8.7 million).
PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND COMPONENTS
The main objective of the Project is to establish sound forest management systems that would maximize the
contribution of Georgia's forests to economic development and rural poverty reduction on an environmentally
sustainable basis.
The Project is of critical importance to Georgia's forests and people. With the enactment of the new Forest
Code of Georgia (June 1999), Georgia has adopted a legal framework and roadmap for transition to market principles
of forest economy, including its possible privatization, while safeguarding the critical environmental, social and
cultural functions of the nation's forests. The Project is designed to provide critical support to this ambitious
transition.
The Project is expected to be implemented over a period of 5 to 6 years and will include the following five
components:

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Component A "Support to National Forest Policy Formulation and Implementation" (US$6.8 million).
Under this component, investments would be made in improving the capacity of the Government of Georgia (GOG)
for forest sector analysis, planning and policy formulation, completing the legislation for implementation of the new
Forest Code, designing and carrying out appropriate institutional, governance and financial reform in the sector,
training of public officials, and raising public awareness in the objectives of the national forest policy.
In particular, this component would support the State Forestry Department (SFD) and other relevant agencies
in: (i) finalization and public discussion of new forest regulations supporting implementation of the 1999 Forest Code
of Georgia; (ii) development and implementation of a forestry institutional reorganization plan; (iii) development and
implementation of a forestry financial system reform plan; (iv) preparation and public discussion of the National
Forest Policy and Strategy and the draft law "On Privatization of State Forests in Georgia". A cohesive system of
implementing regulations would form initial basis for further forest governance reforms and forest policy formulation.
Given this priority, development and discussion of regulations is already carried out under the PPF financing, while
the privatization law and national policy would be finalized at the later stages of the project. The development of the
2



financial system reform plan is also already being financed though the PPF; it would be based on the overall
assessment of the national forest resources, evaluation of the governance, transparency and capacity of the private
sector in forestry, evaluation of the market prospects for wood and non-wood products, and analysis of all public
revenues from forestry, including the setting of stumpage values and the organization of auction systems. The
component would then support implementation of this plan, specifically by setting up a Forest Management
Information System (FMIS) and training the SFD and core ministries' staff in operating it. The development of an
institutional reorganization plan (also financed under the PPF) would lay ground for strengthening normative and
regulatory functions of the SFD, rationalizing central and field capacity for its forest management planning and
oversight responsibilities and proper coordination with other line agencies, private sector, communities, and civil
society. In addition to restructuring the central office, the existing 54 district offices would be replaced with two
regional offices and 36 range offices. The component would then provide all the necessary technical assistance,
training and incremental logistical means (mainly building rehabilitation, transportation, equipment/materials) to
implement this plan. Overall, the most critical elements of this component (development of implementing regulations
and reform planning) are financed up-front through the PPF phase (see Box 1 for a summary of activities financed in
2000-2001 by the PPF credit advance of US$0.99 million).
Component B "Support to Efficient and Participatorn Forest Management Planninq" (US$3.3 million).
Under this component, investments would be made in improving the quality of forest assessment and inventory
carried out by the SFD, introduction of integrated forest conservation and utilization planning techniques on a
landscape-ecological basis, enabling transparent access to forest management planning process and facilitating public
participation it in.
In particular, this component would support: (i) a total economic valuation of Georgian forests; (ii)
preparation of an improved forest inventory for a model forest area of the Central Caucasus Planning Area
("laboratory zone" - four districts over around 460,000 ha); in the Central Caucasus; (iii) preparation of model land-
use and forest management plans for the above areas; and (iv) promotion of public awareness in sustainable forest
management through participatory management planning for community and local forests. These activities would be
implemented jointly and in coordination with the planning component of the GEF-financed Protected Areas
Development Project. The underlying landscape-ecological planning techniques have already been developed using
Japanese grant funding under the preparation phase and the field testing, and an initial inventory of 100,000 ha
(together with provision of equipment and aerial photography) is being carried out with PPF financing. The
component would then support provision of additional equipment, surveys and training to replicate improved
inventory and planning on a significant scale outside of the laboratory zone, and additional facilities and equipment
for information dissemination.
Component C "Support to Effective Forest Protection andAfforestation" (US$9.5 million). Under this
component, investments would be made in forest protection and afforestation of the most critically degraded forest
areas near population centers through improvements in technical capacity of local forest management units and
development of public works in community-based forestry.
In particular, this component would support: (i) improved seed production/processing and nursery
development, (ii) carrying out an afforestation program over about 3,100 ha, and (iii) carrying out a forest restoration
program over about 5,600 ha in the priority zone around Tbilisi. Seed processing and testing operations will be
brought together under one existing Seed Centre that will be upgraded. An existing nursery in the priority zone will
be expanded/upgraded and used for supplying quality seedlings for afforestation and forest restoration, and as a
model for replication in other districts. The afforestation and restoration programs will take place in the priority zone
using a combination of community-managed public works and, where appropriate, private contractors using more
cost-efficient techniques. These actions will result in the SFD having significantly increased its capacity for
collecting, processing and testing quality seeds and producing quality seedlings. They would also facilitate a phased
development of community-managed forestry in Georgia (to be supported by parallel donor financing). Moreover,
around 40% of the erosion-prone areas in the priority zone will be afforested and 10% of the degraded areas restored.
Component D "Promotion of Private Sector Participation in Sustainable Forest Manaetement" (US$6.0
million). Under this component, investments would be made in development, demonstration, certification and
promotion of sustainable forest harvesting and transportation standards and techniques, so as to facilitate the
emergence of private sector operators in forestry, as well as in the development of non-wood forest products, hunting
and ecotourism on an environmentally sustainable basis.
This component would significantly draw on the technical assistance provided under Component A towards
development of the draft law "On Privatization of State Forests in Georgia" where the parts of the national legal and
3



fiscal systems dealing with the possible operations of private businesses in forestry will be revised, simplified and
made more stimulating for entrepreneurs. In particular, this component would support setting up a privately-run
Business Support Association. The Association would be set up on a full cost-recovery basis and would provide
demand-driven support services to interested entrepreneurs (e.g. training in book keeping and management, market
intelligence, certification of products and systems and transfer of improved technologies). The Association would be
initially operated under contract by the private sector that would eventually be expected to take it over and convert it
into a private entity. Furthermore, upon completion of the improved forest management plan in a suitable area of the
Central Caucasus 'laboratory zone', the component would support there a privately-run demonstration program of
improved, low-impact harvesting and transportation systems and a forest road rehabilitation/construction public
program. The program should result in a growing use by private entrepreneurs of independently certified techniques,
processes and equipment that are more cost-efficient and environment-friendly. Moreover, the forest road network
inside the laboratory zone will be significantly improved through the operation of the road construction unit included
as part of the demonstration program introducing improved transportation systems. In addition, the road
rehabilitation/construction works under the public program - contracted out to private entrepreneurs - will cover
about 225 km outside of the laboratory zone. Lastly, the component would support preparation of a strategy for
promoting non-wood forest products and carrying out pilot investments in 2 or 3 selected sites. The component's
support should result in increased sales and exports of wood and non-wood products from the private sector and in a
greater involvement of the entrepreneurs in the carrying out of forestry operations.
Comiponent E "Project Management" (US$1.4 nmillion). This component would support overall project
administration and provide to the SFD staff hands-on training and technology transfer in project development and
implementation, application of fiduciary and anti-corruption safeguards. A number of critical capacity building steps,
including setting up the project management unit, training in implementation and procurement planning, monitoring
& evaluation, financial management systems, etc. - is being financed up-front under the PPF phase (see Box I).
IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
The preparation and implementation of the Project is administered by the Forest Sector Development Center
(FSDC) - a legal body of civil law established by the decree of the President of Georgia on October 29, 2000. FSDC
operates under the overall guidance of a Supervisory Board appointed by the President of Georgia. The Supervisory
Board is chaired by a member of the Parliament of Georgia and comprised of officials of the key interested ministries
and presidential administration, with participation of the academic and NGO community. (To ensure proper
coordination between this project and the GEF-funded Protected Areas Development Project, a significant overlap is
ensured in the membership of their respective Supervisory Boards.) FSDC is headed by the Project Director selected
in an open tender by a selection commission and approved by the President of Georgia. FSDC reports to the Ministry
of Finance of Georgia on financial matters and to the Georgian State Department of Forest Management on technical
matters.

Box 1. Summary of PPF-funded Project Activities
The Government of Georgia has already borrowed US$0.99 million of IDA funds through a PPF
credit advance to implement in 2000-2001 the following subset of front-loaded project activities:
(I)    Development of improved forest policies and regulations, including (i) finalization and
public discussion of new forest regulations supporting implementation of the 1999 Forest
Code of Georgia; (ii) development of a forestry institutional reorganization plan; and (iii)
development of a forestry financial system reform plan;
(2)    Development of improved forest management planning and protection techniques,
including (i) total economic valuation of Georgian forests; (ii) methodology of improved
forest inventory on a landscape-ecological basis in a model forest area in the Central
Caucasus; (iii) participatory management planning for community forests; and (iv)
promotion of public awareness in sustainable forest management;
(3)    Project implementation capacity building, including (i) setting up a project management
unit; (ii) preparation of detailed project implementation, procurement and monitoring and
evaluation plans, financial management systems, including project advisory and audit
services; and (iii) training of project management unit staff.
Up-front implementation of these project activities under the PPF would generate immediate and
sustained benefits to Georgia on their own merit and would also provide favorable conditions for start-up
and efficient implementation of follow-on project activities and increase their developmental impact.

Georgia: Forests Development Project
Project Development Objective
The objective of the project is to establish sustainable forest management systems, which would
maximize the contribution of Georgia's forests to economic development and rural poverty reduction on
an environmentally sustainable basis.
Project Description Summary
The project would support implementation of national regulatory and financial reforms in the forest
sector and capacity building in the State Forestry Department and other agencies dealing with the forest
sector; sustainable forest planning and management in demonstration areas, which would serve for
replication, and support reforestation in degraded areas.
. National Regulatory and Financial Reforms: The project would complete the institutional and
regulatory reforms initiated with PPF financing, and would support:
a)  Finalization of the forest regulatory framework, including finalization if the subsidiary
regulations for proper implementation of the new Forest Code and their harmonization with
environmental, budgetary and tax legislation, redefinition of institutional functions of agencies
related to the forest sector. This would include development of regulations for the transfer and
management of community forests. There would be widespread public discussion of these draft
regulations before they are finalized.
The ongoing transition in Georgia from a centrally planned to a market economy is proving
difficult to achieve, particularly in the forestry sector where environmental considerations (a
public concern) are very important.  Within the framework of the existing National
Environmental Action Plan, a National Forestry Strategy was prepared in 1997 by a Georgian
governmental team with assistance from the World Bank's Institutional Development Fund. The
main objectives of the strategy are to maximize the environmental/economic benefits derived
from the forests while encouraging the privatization of forestry activities to the extend possible.
It is indicated that reform should be carried out in four ways:
i)  to make possible the development of sustainable forestry development,
ii) to elaborate financial/ economic management methods,
iii) to integrate the forestry institutions in the general economic reform,
iv) to interest international community in supporting forestry development.
Although the strategy contains very valid elements, such as the necessity to improve land-use
planning as well as the overall management of the state forests, there is still a need for further
analytical work (clarification /prioritization). In order to obtain fully operational document it is
also important public participation in its preparation and implementation.
Forest Code of Georgia has been approved by the Parliament in 1999, it is a foundation for
institutional and policy reforms in the sector, it provides the legal basis for the organization,
management and financing of the sector. In order to enact the Forest Code, various
supplementary normative acts and regulations have to be prepared. Preparation of regulations
listed below will be a guarantee for sustainable forest management and wood resource
utilization.
1. On authorization of local governing and self governing bodies for managing the local forest
fund and procedures for separating the local forest fund from state forest fund;
2



2.  On procedures for allocating designated area of the state forest fund and regulations for
permitting forest use, permitting, restricted forest use and banning forest use in this area;
3.  On setting boundaries of the usable state forest fund;
4.  On the system of registry of the state forest fund;
5.  On special requirements for registering protected areas of the state forest fund;
6.  On authorized issuance of biological and chemical preparations to the physical and legal
bodies with the purpose of forest protection;
7.  On regulations and methods of inventory of animal wildlife in the specific areas of the state
forest fund;
8.  On the listing of biological, chemical and generic interventions permitted for the purposes
of forest protection;
9.  On selection and use of plant species for restoring and expanding the state forest fund;
10 On calculating and recovering losses born by the state forest fund due to illegal forest use;
11  On regulations for using non-wood resources of the state forest fund;
12  On regulations for accounting for the state forest fund;
13  On information on the state forest fund and its disclosure to the State Department of
Forestry;
14 On regulations for forest protection;
15 On regulations for defining the annual allowable cut;
16 On regulations for producing timber and the secondary wood products;
17 On general regulations for carrying out scientific research and educational activities in the
territory of the state forest fund;
18 On preparing documentation for issuing forest use tickets, including calculations of costs
required for allocating cutting areas and setting regulations for recovery of these costs.
b) Revision of financial and tax regulations, including 1. Revision of the principles and amount of
financing the State Department and other governmental agencies related to the forest sector and
identification of the financial resources dispersed in different institutions and intended for the
implementation of the same functions. Return these revenues and other existing income and use
them to carry out forest protection and management. 2.Revision of forest resource pricing
principles and methodologies, including stumpage regulations in order to differentiate by
quality and provide stronger incentives for resource conservation; 3.Implementation of
administrative regulations in order to carry out forests activities based on the sustainable
management principles and allow for better tracking of timber harvesting and export.
According to the present day Budget and Tax laws all stumpage fees collected from the State
Forest Fund are directed to local budgets. The Tax Law states that the purpose of adoption of
those taxes is the provision of financing of the measures for protection and restoration-
reproduction of nature resources. But neither of the legislation act defines its complete
percentage volume and the rule of its returning to local forestry. Hence the local authorities do
not transfer the above stated income to the adequate body and use it for their local need.
It is necessary to move new introductions to the Budget and Tax Codes and Laws. It will ensure
partly return (40-50%) of forest use tax payment to the local forestry.
The calculation and differentiation of forests timber resources stumpage fees need to be studied
and regulated. At present it is based on the product market price and is differentiated according
to the timber size and the distance between the timber produce place and the nearest railway
station. Today the prices are not transparent, in addition the of goods transportation by road is
more developed than by railway.
Division of forest timber resources needs to be improved. The rule of carrying out of Auction
and fixed price systems are among them. This will stimulate local forest enterprises
development/broadening. The mechanisms of price formation should be elaborated.
3



Forest resources economical evaluation is envisaged by the project. It gives us possibility of
state forest fund total evaluation, of registration non-timber resources procuring and usage and
support non-timber resources evaluation and their involvement into the local forestry income
and Georgian budget.
The following activities should be done:
*   To revise existing legislative base in order to carry out Georgian financial policy (the
Georgian law of State budget, Tax Code, Forest Code and other under law normative
acts);
*   Financing of different governmental institutions related to the forest management and
State control from the State budget and identify the financial resources dispersed in
these institutions and intended for the implementation of the same functions.
*   To revise the indicative plan of Georgian economical development in connection with
the forest sector;
*   To revise the regional (local) socio-economic development plan;
*    To revise the branch structure of regional economics;
*   To define the part of the forest sector in Georgian total inner product;
*   To define the part of the forest sector in commodity circulation;
e   To study the price formation on the main forest products;
T To study the forest products market and trade conditions;
*   To revise tariffs, taxes, licenses, quota, "special tickets" etc.
*   To study the import-export balance;
* To define the methods of registration of the forest sector income;
*   To revise the forest sector expenses (direct and indirect), incomc. currency flow.
financing, liquidity, financial reports and the mechanisms of financial control;
*   To study the methods of marketing;
*   To define the participation of the private sector in forest activities;
T To analyze the financial activities of enterprises engaged in the forest sector;
*   To evaluate Georgian investing environment;
c)  A national public education and awareness campaign to engage the public about the challenges
facing the forest sector to help finalize the new national forest policy and strategy. The project
would support equipment, TV, newspaper and other mass media campaigns, consultancy
services and training for development of the program, workshops, and a hotline for the local
population to send proposals for better forest management.
According to social researches there is a high interest of society to participate in forest resources
management. Unfortunately, most of people are not aware of their legal rights. Because of lack
of information and appropriate knowledge, people try to show their displeasure often in illegal
ways (blocking roads etc) and as a rule they react on the results, not on the reasons causing
these results. The public control is spontaneous and ineffective. Thus the most part of society
prefer to be passive and inert as they see the ineffectiveness of fighting against the illegal
actions in forest sector.
It is for the first time that the new Forest Code allows participation of population and public
association in the management of the State Forest Fund. According to the Code the issues of
regulation of Forest Inventory, division of The State Forest Fund into categories, define the
regime of protection of territories of the State Forest Funds, transfer of the State Forest Fund for
a term of 5 years for temporary use, as well as the accessibility of the information about
condition of the State Forest resources have been guaranteed less the cases stipulated by the
legislation of Georgia.
With the purpose of ensuring the publicity the Project plans to elaborate adequate programs, to
organize " hot " line in Tbilisi, to use mass media and NGO for informing the wide masses of
4



local population and for finding out their opinion. With this purpose it is planned to create a
center favoring the publicity in the Oni region, which through seminars, meetings and
conferences will investigate the opinion of the local population about current situation in forests
and about forest using, will provide attraction of masses in elaboration of plans of management
of local forestry. The training will be organized for elaboration of the programs.
d)  Elaboration of the national standards of forestry certification.
The existing situation in Georgian forests needs to be changed, one way is to implement the
forestry certification in the forestry sector according to the world standards. This system will
help to prevent illegal timber harvesting, decrease forest damages during forest use processes,
eliminate illegal timber export, support the implementation of sustainable forest management
principles and development of the legal timber trade market mechanisms.
The State institutions of the forestry sector and different non governmental organizations
consider that among the certification systems existing in the world, the most suitable for
Georgia is FSC certification system as it have more environmental demands, which are very
important for Georgian forests, having water regulative, soil protective and other unique
properties.
At present where is no such standards in Georgia and the initiative group who has started
independently elaborating them is facing financial and other problems.
The State structures of the forest sector, ministries of economic and environment and the
president of Georgia have supported forest certification and expressed their readiness to assist in
this activity. The implementation of this component is envisaged by the project. For this
purpose it is necessary to form a 3 member unit, equip them with the office space, computer and
supply with special literature. Operational costs of the unit should be include in the project.
g)  The objective of the forest sector reorganization plan is to provide with a detailed, phased and
costed plan for the future role, restructuring and strategic development of the SFD, which will
be a guarantee of the Georgian forests protection, management based on the sustainable
development principles and increase forests economic efficiency. Necessary studies will be
carry out for obtaining a better understanding of the forest department's present role.
management and main activity functions, financial policy of the branch, institutional
possibilities and operational activities with identification of the future optimal scenario on the
central and regional level. The study should be also done to identify the role and duties of the
forestry related state organizations in the field of forest protection, management and state
control. This will include forest department's public purpose activities, not core activities that
could be privatized.
It is supposed to unify the regional forest offices with their resources and forestry activities. The
public juridical body will be established based on the several forestry. The project will create
the necessary material-technical base and be responsible for the reorganized forestry staff
training (carry out building rehabilitation, supply with communicative facilities, office furniture
and techniques).
Setting up the Forestry Management Information System stage by stage is envisaged by the
project. The outputs will be a fully operational FMIS systematizing all forest sector information
and carrying out the monitoring.
h)  Under the project it is foreseen to merge the forest protection Unit and Forest Inspection under
the State Department of Forestry and set up a Unit of Forest Protection and Operational Service.
It is assumed that the mobile group comprising ten members will be responsible for
controlling/inspecting and monitoring the forest operations at national level. The group will
periodically visit the regional offices (including the visits based on the signals received from the
local population), in order to inspect the operational activities carried out by the regional
officers in accordance with the Forest Code, Cutting rules and other normative acts. Besides the
unit will be obliged to reveal and react on all the violations regarding the wood utilization and
forest management. For efficient functioning, it is critical that the unit was well equipped,
5



particularly the unit should have one four-wheel drive vehicles for field visits, 5 mobile phones
for communication, uniforms and one computer for putting all data into and for monitoring.
2. Improved forest Planning and Management in Central Caucasus Pilot Area
a) The elaboration of the forest management updated plans is foreseen under the project. These
plans will improve forest sector organizational, financial, operational and commercial efficiency
and optimize its contribution to the total inner product of Georgia. The following activities
should be done:
*   Elaboration of the new improved forest inventory methodology based on the landscape-
ecological and SFM principles. The methodology must consider socio-economical and
ecological aspects. Carry out the Forests inventory, using the new methodology in Oni
lab.zone first.
*   Elaboration of the total forests economical evaluation methodology and  testing stage
by stage in lab. Zone forests after inventory.
*   Finally, after inventory and total economical evaluation of the forests we will have all
information about resources in lab. zone. It will give possibility to elaborate fully
operational forest management plans.
:   The forest management information centre will be an instrument for the implementation
of forest policies and will help to increase production from State- forested lands through
new forest management plans. Using the information system in the lab. zone the proper
computer program and its effectiveness will be identified
b)  The construction and rehabilitation of the forest roads is envisaged by the project. Amortization
of old roads and lack of new ones have done ecological and economical harm to forests and the
country.
Georgian forests are rich in timber and non-timber resources. It is very important to use these
resources effectively and increase the role of forest sector in the countries total inner product. In
this case all ecological aspects of sustainable forest management principles should be taken into
consideration. In particular the lack of road network causes the press of population on the
nearest forests. Which is the main reason of the forests distraction.
For using natural resources, without destroying ecological balance it is necessary to construct
new roads in the forests. To conduct forest tending, protection and other forest management
activities it is also important to rehabilitate the existing road net-work.
The planned construction of new roads and rehabilitation of existing roads in the Lab-Zone is
45 and 150 km respectively. Geological materials about rock stability as well as updated
machinery will be used during constructing new roads to prevent serious damage of the forest
ecosystem.
c)  Support to improved forest silvicultural operations.
The project envisages the implementation and demonstration of the ecologically improved
cutting machinery and cable logging system. Using these systems The Forest Sector will be able
to produce timber on the 30-35 degree forest fund slopes without destroying it. Under the
project it is foreseen to exam them in the "real" situation, in the lab.zone (2-3 region) and
define the real costs and profits in the connection to the existing situation.
As a result the private sector should study and use these systems.
d)  Forest protection. 43% of Georgia's total territory are forest areas. 39,6% are actually covered
with forests. Georgian forests are constantly threatened by destructive agents such as fire, wind,
insects disease and illegal cutting. Three agents: illegal cutting, forest fires and spreading insect
disease were indicated as the main factor of forest losses over the past decade. Together these
6



account for forest losses averaging 3 million Lari. Losses due to pests account for 84% of this
sum. The Georgian forest management seriously suffers from the insect and disease. They cause
different type of damages such as total defoliation, producing physiological stress and decrease
the timber thickness process, local and dispersed type of withering on the large areas of forests.
In nurseries pests diseases often fully destroy nurseries and decrease outputs of standard
seedlings.
In Georgian forest management system the most spreaded pests diseases are: Ips typofgaphus,
Dendroctonus micans, Ocneria dispar, Nymia phacorrehoea etc. The development of the leaves
and needles eating pest are the reason of their withering. Pests diseases have damaged fir, pine,
chestnut, oak and beech stands in Georgia.
Under the project it is foreseen to study in details pests damaged forest areas, pests spreading
dynamics over past five years, define the types of pests and reasons of their appearance,
prognosticate pests spreading areas and elaborate effective pests preventive activities. It is also
envisaged by this project the restoration-renovation of the pest control laboratory where the
methods of the concrete pest preventive activities will be identified,tested and certified
(satisfactory to the criteria of the policy of GoG and the WB).
The project will pay much attention to the problems of physical protection, which are very
important and actual. At present the forest protection workers of forest management system
have not enough knowledge of the Forest Code's laws and rules. They are enable to use them in
everyday life. Insufficient financial support, lack of equipment and labor power force local
people to use forest properties (legal and illegal harvesting of timber) and satisfy their
elementary needs. This leads to irregular and unsustainable forest use and forests degradation.
Under the project it is foreseen to equip forest protection workers of the forest management
system with beepers, uniforms, means of conveyance and communication. It is also envisaged to
set up barriers and observation points for control and monitoring.
e)  Support to private sector development of non-timber forest products.
The advertisement of non-timber production, hunting and ecotourism is envisaged by the
project. The investment would be implemented in the following actions:
I.   To elaborate the strategy of non-timber products for advertising and for experimental
investments implementation;
2.   To inventory of the lab.zone Wild Life and elaborate the hunting strategy;
3.   To identify the objects of ecotourism and define the model object in the lab.zone;
For these purposes under the project it is foreseen to implemented two business supporting
centers in Oni and Mestia.
f)  Support to communal forest management
It should be noted that in 1995 the Georgian Parliament approved the resolution " On Usable
and Municipal forests" (No 671-11 7.3.1995) to improve forests tending/protection activities.
According to this regulation The Cabinet of Ministry had to transfer to the management above
mentioned forests land to the SDFM.
The process became drawling and from 5165000 ha former "Kolxoz" forests land 3326000 ha
(64%) is transfared to the forest department up-to-date: Including 172000 ha former "kolxoz"
land examined and legally affirmed by the State Committee of Land Management Use and
Protection in Oni region and 3154000 ha forest land transferred to the regional self governing
bodies without material-technical base and demarcation procedures.
1839000ha is left without supervision. Former "kolxoz"forest land is mainly located near the
local population and they use the forests illegally as the source of income, food and energy
(firewood).
7



According to the Forest Code (adopted in 1999) the Local Forest Fund is defined as a part of the
State Usable Forest Fund. The juridical relationship on this matter is regulated by the local
governing and self governing bodies based on the Georgian legislation and the Forest Code.
The rights of the local governing and self governing bodies in local forest fund managing is not
defined. The preparation of the project of the Georgian President decree " on authorization of
local governing and self governing bodies for managing the Local Forest Fund and procedures
for separating the Local Forest Fund from the State Forest Fund " is envisaged by the project.
At present the KFW is financing the establishment of the Municipal forests based on the
Borjomi- Kharagauli National Park nearby forests.
3  Forests Restoration -Afforestation in Degraded areas.
The Forests Restoration-Afforestation program envisages to provide nurseries with seed of
adequate quantity, species and quality. The nurseries from their side will have enough quality,
quantity and seedlings for forests afforestation-restoration.
A) Seed collection, processing and storage
To obtain the adequate quantity and quality seed the following activities should be done:
*   Tools for cleaning undergrowth and improving access to existing seed production
stands;
*   Small storage shelters in each seed production stand;
i   Ladders and hand tools to improve cone collection;
i   Small tractors to collect and transporting cones to forest roads;
*   Renovation of the former seed processing buildings;
R Renovation of selected items of seed processing equipment;
*   Equipment and materials for drying. packaging and dewing seeds;
*   Set up procedures for testing and certification of forest tree seed;
*   Buy the laboratory equipment for seed testing and certification;
B) The renovation of the Sartichala central forest nursery including irrigation system is envisaged
by this project. The credit will finance nursery operating and maintenance costs at the first
stages. Improved forest nursery will produce high quality seed and seedling for afforestation -
renovation works and for individuals. Soon the nursery should be able to cover its costs for
labor, machinery and for reinvestment in technological imnprovements. The long-term goal is
to privatize the nursery.
C) Georgian forests are rich in forest resources
3-3) Georgia is rich in forest resources. However, a large part of the State forests are located
on mountain slopes. Socio-economical problems which developed in Georgia during the last
period, different negative events ( illegal cutting for fuel wood production, livestock in the
forests etc.) and climate problems have effected on the forests degradation and soil erosion
and subsequently on the agricultural productivity. Afforestation programs should be re-
commenced and focused on erosion-prone areas. The region selected for these works, consists
of nine the most damaged districts within a 50 km radius of Tbilisi - "priority zone" where
the 3100 ha erosion and 5600 ha degraded areas are foreseen to be afforestate.
4.  Project management and monitoring.
The preparation and implementation of the Project is administrated by the Forest Sector
Development Center (FSDC)- a legal body of civil law established by IDA Q212-) GE agreement
and by the decree No 469 of the president of Georgia. FSDC is operate under the overall guidance
of a Supervisory Board appointed by the President of Georgia. The Supervisory Board is chaired by
the Chairman of the committee of National Resources and Environment Protection of the
8



Parliament of Georgia and comprised of officials of the key interested ministries and academic and
NGO community. The FDSC is hea ,ed by the Project Director and has six member staff: Technical
Manager, Procurement Specialis  Financial Manager, Accountant, Secretary-Translator and
Operational Assistant. The FSDz. will report to the Georgian State Department of Forest
Management on technical matters and to the Ministry of Finance of Georgia on Financial matters.
The FSDC or the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will elaborate the detailed plans of
Procurement, monitoring, and evaluation, necessary for implementation of the project and will be
responsible for exact fulfillment of these plans and the WB procurement procedures. The PIU will
provide financial management system satisfactory to the WB. With this system all financial and
accounting operations will be carried out, according to demands of the WB and the local bank,
where the special account of the project will be held.
The PIU will collaborate with the State Forest Department. Special training, envisaged by the
project, will help the department staff to be familiar with the WB project implementation,
management, and procurement procedures. The project will finance the PIU members training in
project implementation procedures, Bank project management approaches, special computer
programs and language, PIU office refurbishment, office furniture, financial management computer
programs installation and service and operational costs.

Operationts; and OD 4.20, Indigenrouts Peoples. This OP and BP apply to all projects for which a PID is first
issued after Mlarch 1, 1999. Questions may be addressed to the Chair, Environment Sector Board.
I. The Bankl requires environmental assessment (EA) of projects proposed for Bank financing to help ensure that
they are environmentally sound and sustainable, and thus to improve decision making.
2. EA is a process whose breadth, depth. and type of analysis depend on the nature, scale, and potential
environmental impact of the proposed project. EA evaluates a project's potential environmental risks and impacts
in its area of influence;2 examines project alternatives: identifies ways of improving project selection, siting,
planning, design, and implementation by preventing, minimizing, mitigating, or compensating for adverse
environmental impacts and enhancing positive impacts: and includes the process of mitigating and managing
adverse environmental impacts throughout project implementation. The Bank favors preventive measures over
mitigatory or compensatory measures, whenever feasible.
3. EA takes into account the natural environment (air, water, and land); human health and safety; social aspects
(involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, and cultural property),3 and transboundary and global
environmental aspects.4 EA considers natural and social aspects in an integrated way. It also takes into account
the variations in project and country conditions; the findings of country environmental studies; national
environmental action plans; the country's overall policy framework, national legislation, and institutional
capabilities related to the environment and social aspects; and obligations of the country, pertaining to project
activities, under relevant international environmental treaties and agreements. The Bank does not finance project
activities that would contravene such country obligations, as identified during the EA.
EA is initiated as early as possible in project processing and is integrated closely with the economic, financial,
institutional, social, and technical analyses of a proposed project.
4. The borrower is responsible for carrying out the EA. For Category A projects,5 the borrower retains
independent EA experts not affiliated with the project to carry out the EA.6 For Category A projects that are
highly risky or contentious or that involve serious and multidimensional environmental concerns, the borrower
should normally also engage an advisory panel of independent, internationally recognized environmental
specialists to advise on all aspects of the project relevant to the EA.7 The role of the advisory panel depends on
the degree to which project preparation has progressed, and on the extent and quality of any EA work completed,
at the time the Bank begins to consider the project.
2



5. The Bank advises the borrower on the Bank's EA requirements. The Bank reviews the findings and
recommendations of the EA to determine whether they provide an adequate basis for processing the project for
Bank financing. When the borrower has completed or partially completed EA work prior to the Bank's
involvement in a project, the Bank reviews the EA to ensure its consistency with this policy. The Bank may, if
appropnate, require additional EA work, including public consultation and disclosure.
6. The Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook describes pollution prevention and abatement measures
and emission levels that are normally acceptable to the Bank. However, taking into account borrower country
legislation and local conditions, the EA may recommend alternative emission levels and approaches to pollution
prevention and abatement for the project. The EA report must provide full and detailed justification for the levels
and approaches chosen for the particular project or site.
EA Instruments
7. Depending on the project, a range of instruments can be used to satisfy the Bank's EA requirement:
environmental impact assessment (EIA), regional or sectoral EA, environmental audit, hazard or risk assessment,
and environmental management plan (EMP).8 EA applies one or more of these instruments, or elements of them,
as appropriate. When the project is likely to have sectoral or regional impacts. sectoral or regional EA is
required.9
Environmental Screening
8. The Bank undertakes environmental screening of each proposed project to determine the appropriate extent and
type of EA. The Bank classifies the proposed project into one of four categories, depending on the type, location,
sensitivity, and scale of the project and the nature and magnitude of its potential environmental impacts.
(a) Categoyl A: A proposed project is classified as Category A if it is likely to have significant adverse
environmental impacts that are sensitive,10 diverse, or unprecedented. These impacts may affect an area broader
than the sites or facilities subject to physical works. EA for a Category A project examines the project's potential
negative and positive environmental impacts, compares them with those of feasible alternatives (including the
"without project" situation), and recommends any measures needed to prevent, minimize, mitigate, or compensate
for adverse impacts and improve environmental performance. For a Category A project, the borrower is
responsible for preparing a report, normally an EIA (or a suitably comprehensive regional or sectoral EA) that
includes, as necessary, elements of the other instruments referred to in para. 7.
(b) Categor- B: A proposed project is classified as Category B if its potential adverse environmental impacts on
human populations or environmentally important areas-including wetlands, forests, grasslands, and other natural
habitats-are less adverse than those of Category A projects. These impacts are site-specific; few if any of them are
irreversible: and in most cases mitigatory measures can be designed more readily than for Category A projects.
The scope of EA for a Category B project may vary from project to project. but it is narrower than that of
Category A EA. Like Category A EA, it examines the project's potential negative and positive environmental
impacts and recommends any measures needed to prevent, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for adverse impacts
and improve environmental performance. The findings and results of Category B EA are described in the project
documentation (Project Appraisal Document and Project Information Document). 11
(c) Category C: A proposed project is classified as Category C if it is likely to have minimal or no adverse
environmental impacts.
Beyond screening, no further EA action is required for a Category C project.
(d) Category F!: A proposed project is classified as Category Fl if it involves investment of Bank funds through a
financial intermediary, in subprojects that may result in adverse environmental impacts.
EA for Special Project Types
Sector Investment Lending
9. For sector investment loans (SILs),12 during the preparation of each proposed subproject, the project
coordinating entity or implementing institution carries out appropriate EA according to country requirements and
the requirements of this policy.13 The Bank appraises and, if necessary, includes in the SIL components to
strengthen, the capabilities of the coordinating entity or the implementing institution to (a) screen subprojects, (b)
3



obtain the necessary expertise to carry out EA, (c) review all findings and results of EA for individual
subprojects, (d) ensure implementation of mitigation measures (including, where applicable, an EMP), and (e)
monitor environmental conditions during project implementation.14 If the Bank is not satisfied that adequate
capacity exists for carrying out EA, all Category A subprojects and, as appropriate, Category B subprojects-
including any EA reports-are subject to prior review and approval by the Bank.
Sector Adjustment Lending
10. Sector adjustment loans (SECALs) are subject to the requirements of this policy. EA for a SECAL assesses
the potential environmental impacts of planned policy, institutional, and regulatory actions under the loan. 15
Financial Intermediarn Lending
11. For a financial intermediary (Fl) operation, the Bank requires that each Fl screen proposed subprojects and
ensure that subborrowers carry out appropriate EA for each subproject. Before approving a subproject, the Fl
verifies (through its own staff, outside experts. or existing environmental institutions) that the subproject meets
the environmental requirements of appropriate national and local authorities and is consistent with this OP and
other applicable environmental policies of the Bank.1 6
12. In appraising a proposed Fl operation, the Bank reviews the adequacy of country environmental requirements
relevant to the project and the proposed EA arrangements for subprojects, including the mechanisms and
responsibilities for environmental screening and review of EA results. When necessary, the Bank ensures that the
project includes components to strengthen such EA arrangements. For Fl operations expected to have Category A
subprojects, prior to the Bank's appraisal each identified participating Fl provides to the Bank a written
assessment of the institutional mechanisms (including, as necessary, identification of measures to strengthen
capacity) for its subproject EA work. 17 If the Bank is not satisfied that adequate capacity exists for carrying out
EA, all Category A subprojects and, as appropriate. Category B subprojects-including EA reports-arc subject to
prior review and approval by the Bank. 18
Emergency Recovety Projects
13. The policy set out in OP 4.01 normally applies to emergency recovery projects processed under OP 8.51),
Emergencv Recovery Assistance. However, when compliance with any requirement of this policy would prevent
the effective and timely achievement of the objectives of an emergency recovery project, the Bank may exempt
the project from such a requirement. The justification for any such exemption is recorded in the loan documents.
In all cases, however, the Bank requires at a minimum that (a) the extent to which the emergency was precipitated
or exacerbated by inappropriate environmental practices be determined as part of the preparation of such projects,
and (b) any necessary corrective measures be built into either the emergency project or a future lending operation.
Institutional Capacity
14. When the borrower has inadequate legal or technical capacity to carry out key EA-related functions (such as
review of EA, environmental monitoring, inspections, or management of mitigatory measures) for a proposed
project, the project includes components to strengthen that capacity.
Public Consultation
15. For all Category A and B projects proposed for IBRD or IDA financing, during the EA process, the borrower
consults project-affected groups and local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) about the project's
environmental aspects and takes their views into account.]19 The borrower initiates such consultations as early as
possible. For Category A projects, the borrower consults these groups at least twice: (a) shortly after
environmental screening and before the terms of reference for the EA are finalized; and (b) once a draft EA report
is prepared. In addition, the borrower consults with such groups throughout project implementation as necessary
to address EA-related issues that affect them.20
Disclosure
16. For meaningful consultations between the borrower and project-affected groups and local NGOs on all
4



Category A and B projects proposed for IBRD or IDA financing, the borrower provides relevant material in a
timely manner prior to consultation and in a form and language that are understandable and accessible to the
groups being consulted.
17. For a Category A project, the borrower provides for the initial consultation a summary of the proposed
project's objectives, description, and potential impacts; for consultation after the draft EA report is prepared, the
borrower provides a summary of the EA's conclusions. In addition, for a Category A project, the borrower makes
the draft EA report available at a public place accessible to project-affected groups and local NGOs. For SILs and
Fl operations, the borrower/Fl ensures that EA reports for Category A subprojects are made available in a public
place accessible to affected groups and local NGOs.
18. Any separate Category B report for a project proposed for IDA financing is made available to project-affected
groups and local NGOs. Public availability in the borrowing country and official receipt by the Bank of Category
A reports for projects proposed for IBRD or IDA financing, and of any Category B EA report for projects
proposed for IDA funding, are prerequisites to Bank appraisal of these projects.
19. Once the borrower officially transmits the Category A EA report to the Bank, the Bank distributes the
summary (in English) to the executive directors (EDs) and makes the report available through its InfoShop. Once
the borrower officially transmits any separate Category B EA report to the Bank. the Bank makes it available
through its lnfoShop._l If the borrower objects to the Bank's releasing an EA report through the World Bank
InfoShop, Bank staff (a) do not continue processing an IDA project, or (b) for an IBRD project, submit the issue
of further processing to the EDs.
Implementation
20. During project implementation, the borrower reports on (a) compliance with measures agreed with the Bank
on the basis of the findings and results of the EA, including implementation of any EMP, as set out in the project
documents; (b) the st.Itus of mitigatory measures: and (c) the findings of monitoring programs. The Bank bases
supervision of the project's environmental aspects on the findings and recommendations of the EA, including
measures set out in the legal agreements, any EMP, and other project documents.22
1. "Bank" includes IDA; "EA" refers to the entire process set out in OP/BP 4.01: "loans" includes credits;
"borrower" includes, for guarantee operations, a private or public project sponsor receiving from another financial
institution a loan guaranteed by the Bank; and "project" covers all operations financed by Bank loans or
guarantees except structural adjustment loans (for which the environmental provisions are set out in OP/BP 8.60,
Adjustimient Lending, forthcoming) and debt and debt service operations, and also includes projects under
adaptable lending-adaptable program loans (APLs) and learning and innovation loans (LILs)-and projects and
components funded under the Global Environment Facility. The project is described in Schedule 2 to the
Loan/Credit Agreement. This policy applies to all components of the project, regardless of the sourcc of
financing.
2. For definitions, see Annex A. The area of influence for any project is determined with the advice of
environmental specialists and set out in the EA terms of reference.
3. See OP/BP 4.12, Involuntary Resettlement (forthcoming); OD 4.20, Indigenous Peoples; and OP 4.11,
Safeguarding Cultural Property in Bank-Financed Projects (forthcoming).
4. Global environmental issues include climate change, ozone-depleting substances, pollution of international
waters, and adverse impacts on biodiversity.
5. For screening, see para. 8.
6. EA is closely integrated with the project's economic, financial, institutional, social, and technical analyses to
ensure that (a) environmental considerations are given adequate weight in project selection, siting, and design
decisions; and (b) EA does not delay project processing. However, the borrower ensures that when individuals or
entities are engaged to carry out EA activities, any conflict of interest is avoided. For example, when an
independent EA is required, it is not carried out by the consultants hired to prepare the engineering design.
7. The panel (which is different from the dam safety panel required under OP/ BP 4.37, Safety of Dams) advises
the borrower specifically on the following aspects: (a) the terms of reference for the EA, (b) key issues and
methods for preparing the EA, (c) recommendations and findings of the EA, (d) implementation of the EA's
recommendations,    and       (e)     development    of    environmental    management    capacity.
8. These terms are defined in Annex A. Annexes B and C discuss the content of EA reports and EMPs.
9. Guidance on the use of sectoral and regional EA is available in EA Sourcebook Updates 4 and 15.
10. A potential impact is considered "sensitive" if it may be irreversible (e.g., lead to loss of a major natural
habitat) or raise issues covered by OD 4.20, Indigenous Peoples; OP 4.04, Natural Habitats; OP 4.11,
Safeguarding Cultural Property in Bank-Financed Projects (forthcoming); or OP 4.12, Involuntary Resettlement
5



(forthcoming).
I1. When the screening process determines, or national legislation requires, that any of the environmental issues
identified warrant special attention, the findings and results of Category B EA may be set out in a separate report.
Depending on the type of project and the nature and magnitude of the impacts, this report may include, for
example, a limited environmental impact assessment, an environmental mitigation or management plan, an
environmental audit, or a hazard assessment. For Category B projects that are not in environmentally sensitive
areas and that present well-defined and well-understood issues of narrow scope, the Bank may accept alternative
approaches for meeting EA requirements: for example, environmentally sound design criteria, siting criteria, or
pollution standards for small-scale industrial plants or rural works; environmentally sound siting criteria,
construction standards, or inspection procedures for housing projects; or environmentally sound operating
procedures for road rehabilitation projects.
12. SILs normally involve the preparation and implementation of annual investment plans or subprojects as time
slice activities over the course of the project.
13. In addition, if there are sectorwide issues that cannot be addressed through individual subproject EAs (and
particularly if the SIL is likely to include Category A subprojects), the borrower may be required to carry out
sectoral EA before the Bank appraises the SlL.
1 4. Where, pursuant to regulatory requirements or contractual arrangements acceptable to the Bank, any of these
review functions are carried out by an entity other than the coordinating entity or implementing institution. the
Bank appraises such alternative arrangements; however, the borrower/coordinating entity/implementing
institution remains ultimately responsible for ensuring that subprojects meet Bank requirements.
15. Actions that would require such assessment include, for example, privatization of environmentally sensitive
enterprises, changes in land tenure in areas with important natural habitats, and relative price shifts in
commodities such as pesticides, timber, and petroleum.
16. The requirements for Fl operations are derived from the EA process and are consistent with the provisions of
para. 6 of this OP. The EA process takes into account the type of finance being considered, the nature and scale of
anticipated subprojects, and the environmental requirements of the jurisdiction in which subprojects will be
located.
17. Any FI included in the project after appraisal complies with the same requirement as a condition of its
participation.
18. The criteria for prior review of Category B subprojects, which are based on such factors as type or size of the
subproject and the EA capacity of the financial intermediary, are set out in the legal agreements for the project.
19. For the Bank's approach to NGOs, see GP 14.70. Involving Nongovernmental Organizations in Bank-
Supported Activities.
20. For projects with major social components, consultations are also required by other Bank policies-for
example. OD 4.20, Indigenous Peoples, and OP/BP 4.12, Involuntary Resettlement (forthcoming).

Environmental Assessment Sourcebook
UPDATE
Environment Department
The World Bank Number 4
October 1993
Sectoral Environmental Assessment
Sectoral environmental assessment (SEA) is a much needed complement to project-specific EAs in development
planning. Where project EAs focus on the impacts of specific investments and often treat sector strategic
planning as a given, SEA offers an opportunity for sector-wide environmental analysis before investment
priorities have been determined. It also supports integration of environmental concems into long-term
development and investment planning. SEA is most commonly applied in the context of sector investment
programs involving multiple sub-projects. It can also be applied in con-junction with sector-oriented time-slice
and line-of-credit projects, and even with sectoradjustment operations orin evaluation of sectorpolicies.
This EA Sourcebook Update, which belongs to Chapter 1: The Environmental Review Process (Update Binder),
de-scribes SEA in terms of advantages, operational context, selection criteria, and components. It also discusses
what some of the challenges associated with SEA preparation are, and how SEA is being used in Bank
operations. This Update expands on existing information in Chapter 1 (pp. 14-17) of the EA Sourcebook.
Background
World Bank guidance on sectoral EA was introduced in 1989 with the adoption of Operational Directive (OD)
4.00, Annex A: Environmental Assessment (amended in 1991 as OD 4.01). The Environmental Assessment
Sourcebook (1991) provided more detailed advice that has helped the Bank and its borrowers to introduce SEA
in project preparation, despite the lack of a tested methodology. On the basis of this accumulated experience, it
is now possible to expand Bank guidance on SEA.
SEA avoids the inherent limitations of project-specific EAs in addressing issues related to policy and planning
and the legal and institutional framework. By moving upstream in the planning process to a stage where major
strategic decisions have not yet been made, SEA offers better opportunities not only for analyzing existing
policies, institutions, and development plans in terms of environmental issues, but also for supporting
environmentally sound sector-wide investment strategies. A SEA may, for example, allow for a more realistic
environmental assessment of competing investment alternatives in the power sector, where one option might
favor massive coal thermal and hydro-electric expansion; a second option, nuclear and hydro-electric power; and
a third, a combination of coal and gas thermal power coupled with demand-side management and development
of renewable biomass energy. Similarly, where project-specific EA would analyze the impacts on ambient air
quality around a new industrial estate, the sectoral EA might look at the cumulative effects of acid rain or other
problems resulting from proposed industrial developments in terms of their regional, national or even trans-
national impacts.
The Bank's increasing use of programmatic, sector-oriented loans and time-slice investment programs has
served to build demand for a sectoral EA approach, and has provided the best opportunities for developing SEA
as a planning tool. An example of this approach is presented in Box 1. In other cases, sectoral EA may be the
only EA output if the sub-projects do not require EAs individually. Environmental planning measures andlor
guidelines developed b% 'he SEA may then be applied (see Box 2 for a list of Bank-financed projects with a SEA
component).
Advantages of Sectoral EAs
The growing Bank experience with SEAs has revealed several important benefits to be gained from use of this
instrument in development planning (see Boxes 1 and 3-6). The following advantages are worth highlighting:
*  Sectoral EAs can prevent serious environmental impacts through analysis of sector policies and
investment strategies upstream in the planning process, before major decisions are made.
*  They can assist governments in forming a long-term view of the sector and can increase the
transparency of the sectoral planning process (that is, show the reasoning behind development plans),
thereby decreasing the opportunities for purely political decisions that might be environmentally harmful.
*  They are suitable for analysis of institutional, legal and regulatory aspects related to the sector, and for
making comprehensive and realistic recommendations regarding, for example, environmental
standards, guidelines, law enforcement, and training, thus reducing the need for similar analysis in
downstream EA work.
*  They provide opportunities for consideration of alternative policies, plans, strategies or project types,
taking into account their costs and benefits, particularly the environmental and social costs that are
often ignored in least-cost project planning.
7



* SEAs help to alter or eliminate environmentally unsound investment alternatives at an early stage, thus
reducing overall negative environmental impacts, while also eliminating the need for project-specific EA
of these alternatives (see Figure 1).
* They are well suited to consider cumulative impacts of multiple ongoing and planned investments within
a sector, as well as impacts from existing policies and policy changes.
* They are valuable for collecting and organizing environmental data into information and, in the process,
identifying data gaps and needs at an early stage, and for outlining methods, schedules and
responsibilities for data collection and management during program or project implementation.
* They allow for comprehensive planning of general sector-wide mitigation, management, and monitoring
measures, and for identifying broad institutional, resource and technological needs at an early stage.
* They provide a basis for collaboration and coordination across sectors, and help to avoid duplication of
efforts and policy contradictions between sector agencies and ministries.
 They may strengthen preparation and implementation of sub-projects by recommending criteria for
environmental analysis and review, and standards and guidelines for project implementation.
The Operational Context
Three broad operational contexts, or situations, may trigger SEA work. The need to interpret OD 4.01 varies
according to these contexts.
The first type of situation is a category A or B in-vestment program or a series of independent A and/or B projects
in a given sector. In these cases, the process and timing and the scope of the SEA should follow the
requirements of OD 4.01. For B projects a limited sectoral environmental analysis would normally be the
appropriate form of SEA. Types of projects in this first context may include:
* a national or sub-national sector program;
* a series of projects in the same sector;
* a large project with sectoral implications;
* a sectoral intermediate credit operation; or
* a sectoral time-slice investment operation.
The second context is in projects and programs where a SEA is prepared to complement the planning process.
These SEAs may be triggered by Bank environmental screening of a project; but they cover a broader set of
issues than merely the impact of the project, and they proceed in parallel with the required project EA work. This
SEA approach may, for example, be appropriate in sectors with widespread and well-known environmental
damage although the project supported by the Bank may not create any significant additional problems. The
Bank might help secure funding for such SEA work, but OD 4.01 does not directly apply (and subsequently the
SEA does not have to be completed prior to appraisal). Box 6 provides an example of a SEA prepared in this
context.
The third context is when sectoral environmental analysis is employed without any direct link to lending activities.
In this case, the SEA is typically related to Bank economic and sector analysis for a country. OD 4.01 does not
apply, and no particular procedures need to be followed although this Update may provide valuable information.
Criteria for Choosing SEA
The following questions will help identify where a sectoral EA approach may be particularly appropriate and
useful in a project or program where 00 4.01 applies. If the answer to the following question is positive, SEA
should be seriously considered:
Is the Bank considering any of the investment types listed in the section on Operational Context
(above), in a sector with significant environmental issues?
If the answer to the next three questions is also positive, SEA is highly recommended:
* Are there major existing environmental problems associated with the sector, and/or sector-wide
potential environmental impacts resulting from the proposed program or series of projects?
* Is there a clear potential for significant environmental improvement or avoidance of major problems in
the sector?
* Are there clear policy, regulatory and/or institutional weaknesses relative to environmental management
in the sector?
8



* In addition, there are conditions that increase the potential value of SEAs but are not sufficient or
completely necessary requirements:
*  Is the borrower at an early planning stage or at a new major investment phase, where important
strategic decisions have not yet been made?
* Are conditions in the sector relatively stable and predictable (rather than tending to rapid and
unpredictable change), so as to allow for a medium to long-term planning horizon and therefore better
chance of gaining long-term value from the SEA?
* Is the borrower willing to pay for the SEA and likely to give weight to the findings and recommendations?
Sections of a Sectoral EA Report
SEAs will vary in scope and content according to the types and significance of issues and the operational
context. A general outline for a full (category A) SEA can be constructed, however, using the guidance pro-vided
in OD 4.01, Annex B, for a full project-specific EA (see also Box 5 for a sector-specific example).
Executive Summary. As in a project-specific EA, a SEA should contain an executive summary (in English), with
a concise discussion of significant findings and recommended actions.
Policy, Legal and Administrative Framework . This section is one of the most important parts of a sectoral EA.
It is helpful to analyze both (1) the nation-al environmental legal, regulatory and institutional framework, and (2)
sector-specific policies, regulations and institutions (see Box 3). If other, recent studies have already analyzed
these dimensions in an adequate way, the SEA should draw on this work rather than duplicate it.
* The national framework. The relevant national environmental policies, laws and regulations should be
assessed for completeness and appropriateness in light of the particular conditions and problems of the
sector, and gaps and weaknesses noted. Non-environmental laws and policies that have significance for
the sector's utilization of resources, production processes, or pollution should also be identified.
Similarly, the national regulatory framework for EA preparation and review should be assessed. The
SEA should look closely at the institutional capacity of the main environmental ministry or agency, in
terms of effectiveness and capacity for providing guidelines, setting and enforcing standards, and
reviewing environmental assessments. The capacity and performance of agencies responsible for
specific environmental services such as nature protection and cultural heritage should also be reviewed
when relevant.
* The sector framework. The SEA should analyze sector-specific policies, laws and regulations that have
environmental implications. It should also identify how environmental responsibilities are distributed
among (public or private) sector institutions and assess their capacity to administer these tasks. The
sectoral investment planning process, in terms of objectives, methodology and procedures for review
an- approval of plans and projects, should be carefully reviewed. The relationship between timing of
project review, issuance of licenses and permits, and the sectoral planning process should be clearly
indicated. The SEA should assess whether environmental and social issues are adequately covered by
current procedures.
Project Description. The nature and objectives of the program, plan, series of projects or other context to which
the SEA is attached should be described, and the main environmental issues associated with the sector and
these programs, identified.
Baseline Data. This section should describe and evaluate the current environmental situation in the sector.
Where a project-specific EA would describe conditions such as ambient air and water quality or existing impacts
from pollution around a proposed project site, the SEA should concentrate on the issues and problems that are
typical of the sector as a whole. For example, occupational health may be a concern across enterprises within a
specific industry: seepage of heavy metals into streams and groundwater may be a recurring problem in the
mining sector; or deforestation may result from activities in the agriculture sector. Another important function of
this section is to note major data gaps.
Environmental Impacts. The single most difficult challenge in SEAs is to produce a sufficiently precise impact
analysis, often in the face of uncertainties related to the final investment decisions and their individual and
combined impacts. In recent years, advances have been made in the methodologies for assessing cumulative
impacts, in relation to development plans and programs. Means include quantitative modeling, forecasting and
various qualitative analyses. If any proposed sub-project is expected to cause particularly significant impacts, the
SEA should recommend an appropriate course of action to address them, including carrying out a project-
specific EAs (see Box 4).
All cumulative effects should be considered: positive and negative, direct and indirect, long-term and short-term.
Aggregate problems such as sewage discharge, acid rain, ozone depletion and deforestation are usually the
result of several activities, sometimes stemming predominantly from a single sector. Cumulative impacts on
environmentally important and sensitive areas and assets such as coastal zones and wetlands, or freshwater
resources, are also important in cases where the sector activities heavily affect these areas and/or resources.
9



The sectoral EA is an appropriate instrument for considering issues related to long-term sustainable
development. Specifically, the SEA may contain a discussion of how a proposed investment program may
influence long-term productivity of environmental resources affected by the program.
Analysis of Alternatives. A major purpose of a SEA is to do a thorough analysis of alternative investment
options and strategies in terms of environmental costs and benefits. For example, if a proposed agricultural
program emphasizes conversion of wetlands to rice production, an alternative approach such as intensification of
production in existing fields, conversion of other land types, or crop rotation may be considered.
All major investments under consideration, be-sides the option being considered by the Bank, should be
considered at this stage, whether complementary or alternative to the Bank option. The other options may
include investments by the private as well as the public sector.
A comparative analysis of alternative programs is highly recommended, applying indicators of environ-mental
and social impacts and methods to evaluate and compare the indicators and ultimately the alter-native options.
Where several donors are involved in the sector, the SEA should review their existing and/or planned activities
and, if necessary, suggest ways to coordinate efforts.
The sectoral EA can also be used to evaluate the environmental effects of sector policy alternatives. For
example, changes in tax and subsidy rates on the use of natural resources may greatly influence rates and
methods of extraction.
The analysis could conclude with a list of sector proposals, ranked according to environmental preference. The
analysis of impacts and alternatives should result in a recommendation for an optimal investment strategy, in
terms of environmental and social costs and benefits.
Mitigation Plan. Mitigation measures are usually of a detailed, technical nature, and therefore normally
addressed in project-specific EAs. However, if planned or existing production and process technologies in a
sector are relatively uniform, the SEA could recommend broad options for eliminating, reducing to acceptable
levels, or mitigating environmental impacts. Such solutions could include a complete production system design
as well as end-of-pipe cleaning technologies. SEA mitigation recommendations should draw on findings from the
analysis of policy, legal and institutional issues as well as the analysis of impacts and alternatives.
A SEA is an effective tool for designing and recommending mitigation measures that can be implemented only at
the national or sectoral level for regulatory or economic reasons. In an urban transportation program, for
example, automobile emission limits could be recommended if the level of emissions were found to supersede
acceptable standards for air quality. Similarly, in a sector program involving multiple investments, the SEA may
be better placed than project-specific EAs to consider sector-wide mitigation solutions that require economies of
scale in order to be cost-effective. Construction of a solid waste recycling plant for an entire country is one such
example.
Environmental Management and Training. One of the main outputs of a SEA should be an institutional plan for
improving environmental management in the sector, based on findings of the previous sections ( see Boxes 1
and 6). The plan might recommend training of existing staff, hiring of additional staff, reorganization of units or
agencies, or redefinition of roles and responsibilities. This section might also include recommendations on policy
and regulatory instruments for environmental management and enforcement in the sector. A screening process
to separate those sub-project needing a project-specific EA from those not requiring further analysis should be
designed, if it is not already in place (see Box 4).
Environmental Monitoring Plan. The SEA should provide general guidelines for long-term sector-wide
environmental monitoring to ensure adequate implementation of investments. A monitoring plan should use the
findings of the baseline data section as a basis to measure progress in mid-term review and final evaluation. The
plan should also recommend measures needed to collect and organize missing data.
Public Consultation. Public consultation is an integral part of the EA process, whether a project-specific or
sectoral EA is being prepared (see OD 4.01 and EA Sourcebook Update No. 5: Public Involvement in
Environmental Assessment for more specific guidance). However, since a SEA normally covers an entire sector
(in a national or subnational context) and is con-ducted before concrete investment decisions are made, it may
not always be possible to consult representatives of all potentially affected people during preparation of the SEA.
Often, it is more feasible and appropriate to carry out consultations with national NGOs (for example, for nature
protection), scientific experts, relevant government agencies, and perhaps also industrial and commercial
interests. A successfully implemented consultation process will help ensure public support for the final sector
program.
Challenges in SEA
Timing and Status
In order for a SEA to reach its full potential as a planning tool, it must be undertaken in concert with the overall
investment planning in the sector. In practice, this is sometimes difficult to achieve because Bank-financed
projects and programs are often prepared after government sector planning and strategic decision- making. This
10



makes any consideration of strategic alternatives difficult. Early coordination between the planning processes of
the borrower and the Bank is the best way to overcome this constraint.
If a SEA is undertaken, its relevance to sector planning should be ensured through preparation of terms of
reference (TORs) and coordination be;veen preparers and sector planners. If SEAs over time demonstrate high
quality and usefulness as a planning tool, they likely will have growinL. asceptance.
Costs
A sectoral EA is generally more costly to undertake than project-specific EA. For this reason, some borrowers
may be reluctant to choose the SEA option unless the SEA can be expected to so improve the quality of sector
planning that the need will be reduced for project-specific EA work-and associated costs-downstream.
Appropriate TORs and Consultants
Experience and special skills are required to do adequate SEA work, especially in cumulative impact assessment
and in analysis of alternative options and the policy, legal and institutional framework. At the same time, TORs
for the EA need to be realistic in their requirements and manageable. TORs should narrow the scope of analysis
to issues that are most significant and widespread within the sector, rather than require coverage of all aspects.
TOR preparation and EA team selection should also support development of in-country capacity for SEA work.
Adjusting to Circumstances
A sectoral EA approach may be useful even in cases where major sector decisions have already been made. For
example, the SEA can be adjusted to the purposes of a time-slice or financial intermediary loan involving
numerous sub-projects in which the primary issue is setting up appropriate mechanisms for sub-project
screening, review, impact analysis, and monitoring. In these cases, doing a more limited SEA may reduce the
amount of EA work needed for individual sub-projects, while facilitating more effective review and monitoring at
the sectoral level.
In many developing countries, economic and social changes are often rapid and unpredictable, as are changes
in technological opportunities (for example, with regard to pollution abatement). On the other hand, planning time
frames tend to be long-term due to difficulties in raising capital and limited absorptive capacity. Because of this
tension, a full SEA may not always be the optimal option. An alternative approach, currently used by Kenya in the
energy sector and supported by the Bank, is to identify major investment options within the sector, rank them by
environ-mental and social criteria and impacts, and provide a general overview of mitigation requirements for
each option. This approach allows for gathering of essential data and can serve as a "preamble" to project-
specific EAs where needed.
Ensuring Specificity and Follow-Up
Doing a SEA should not become an excuse for over-looking site-specific environmental issues, even though the
emphasis is primarily on issues generic to the sector. The SEA should be employed to identify prevalent
problems in the sector as a whole and major site-specific problems, which might subsequently be addressed in
project-specific environmental assessment. The SEA should help determine where more EA work is needed
downstream.

Box 1. State of Orissa, India: Water Resources Consolidation Project
India has begun increasing irrigation capacity through more efficient operation and maintenance of existing
facilities, rather than through construction and development. A series of Water Resources Consolidation projects
(WRCP) currently being planned by four State Governments and supported by the Bank will facilitate this change of
direction. A sectoral EA approach is being adopted for these projects because: (1) they are substantially
programmatic and not all activities will be fully defined at appraisal; (2) the main environmental issues concern
monitoring and management rather than impacts from new construction projects; and (3) environ-mental
considerations related mainly to water quality and quantity are becoming increasingly important in all these states.
The governments need improved technical advice on how to cope with these challenges on the institutional and
policy level.
The first of these projects was Orissa WRCP, and preparation of the SEA was divided into two phases. Phase 1,
currently in progress, focuses heavily on the institutional and legal framework for the water sector and includes the
following objectives and tasks:
*  to assist in establishing an Environmental Group within the Orissa Irrigation Department's Central
Planning Unit;
*  to review the status of environmental legislation and its applicability to the water resource sector in
general, and to proposed projects in particular;
.  to provide guidelines for the approach to and the preparation of required Site Clearance and
Environmental Clearance documents for various types of irrigation projects (such as dams, irrigation
development, river basin plans, major drainage and flood protection works, and rehabilitation of major
irrigation schemes);
.  to provide initial training for the water resource sector and other related government staff in EA
procedures, techniques and analyses;
.  to establish the organization, staffing levels, responsibilities, operating procedures and budgeting for a
proposed environmental sector unit;
.  to prepare a comprehensive training and institution-al strengthening program, including 2-3 case study
EAs for representative projects; and
.  to delineate procedures for interagency liaison and internal department clearances for water resource
project EAs with departments such as Environment, Forests, and Health Service.
.  The total cost of the Phase 1 program was estimated at US $446,700, with staff requirements estimated at
34.5 person months.
Phase 2 will be based on findings and recommendations of the first phase. It would probably include such
components as preparation and completion of the case studies, long-term training in EA, preparation of monitoring
plans for the irrigation sector, and upgrade of the environmental monitoring facilities.
Box 3. Bolivia: Sectoral EA for Industry and Mining
The purpose of this EA was to help design the Environment, Industry and Mining Project (EIMP), proposed to begin
about mid-1995. A sectoral approach was chosen to strengthen capability in planning new industrial and mining
investments and to build institutional capacity for environmental management. The SEA was prepared by a
Swedish team and a counterpart group appointed by the National Environmental Secretariat (SENMA). The EA
report included all the components described in OD 4.01-Annex B, with an emphasis on (1) the policy, legal and
institutional framework, generally and specifically, for the two sectors; (2) assessment of impacts from on-going
activities and planned investments (covering natural resources and the environment, occupational health and
safety, social structures, and heavily affected regions); and (3) recommendations for a mitigation plan. There was
also a separate chapter on public participation in the EA process, which documented consultations with some 40
governmental and nongovernmental organizations, including several NGOs at the local level.
Policy, Legal and Institutional Framework
The analysis of the cross-sectoral policy, legal and institutional framework was comprehensive and covered the
following aspects: (1) organization of the State (branches of government, key ministries and major legal
instruments); (2) economic policy; (3) national policies, laws and institutions for the environment; (4) environmental
impact assessment requirements; (5) policies and laws for the use of natural resources; (6) environmental
12



management in areas such as water quality, solid waste, pesticides and air pollution; (7) occupational health and
safety; and (8) foreign assistance. Major issues related to the policy, legal and institutional framework included: (1)
unclear environmental law about institutional responsibilities, which leads to weak enforcement; (2) almost no
environmental laws regarding mining, and poor enforcement of the few provisions in place; (3) no regulations
specifically for hazardous waste or industrial air emissions; and (4) no effective regulation of industrial water
pollution except in a few municipalities.
EA Recommendations
The EA preparers were able to produce a senes of concrete recommendations that were directly related to the
environmental problems caused by activities in the two sectors. Recommendations for changes fell into three
areas: (1) broad policy, legal and institutional changes (e.g., setting goals for ambient environmental quality,
implementing new EIA regulation, and improving laboratory capacity): (2) major mitigation activities (e.g., ad-
dressing environmental issues in privatization of state-owned mines on the basis of environmental audits, ex-
tending sewerage systems in Cochabamba. and addressing problems related to alluvial gold mining in the Bolivian
Amazon basin); and (3) additional priorities (e.g., encouraging broad public participation, building a coherent
national environmental database, and introducing environmental audits, first voluntarily and eventually as a
requirement, of industrial and mining facilities).
Box 4. Procedures for Sectoral EA: Asia Region
Extensive experience with program and time-slice lending in the highway sector, particularly rural areas, has
spurred development of informal procedures for sectoral EA in the Bank's Asia region, to ensure consideration of
all possible impacts on the environment. According to the informal procedures, a sectoral EA should contain:
* a screening process designed to identify sub-projects having potentially significant issues that would need to be
addressed in a sub-project EA;
* a general assessment of the kinds of impacts that might be associated with the different types of rural road sub-
projects; and
* a sectoral environmental action plan to eliminate, minimize or mitigate the impacts identified in the sectoral EA,
and provide general guidelines for long-term monitoring.
Two categories are used in environmental screening of sub-projects:
* sub-projects that may create a few minor and easily recognizable environmental problems, but no significant
ones; and
* sub-projects with potentially adverse impacts on environmentally sensitive areas, defined as zones of significant
human habitation; ecologically important areas such as wetlands and primary forests; archeological, historical and
cultural sites; and terrain with slope greater than 50%.
The second category of sub-projects requires project-specific EA, while the first category is ad-dressed primarily
through the sectoral EA in the form of general impact assessments, sectoral action plans, and codes of engineering
practice for environmentally sustainable road development. These codes apply to both categories of sub-projects
and cover such issues as construction practices, site selection, resettlement and compensation, and public
consultationl participation.
Box 5. Technical SEA Guidelines in the
Electricity Sector: LAC Region
The Bank's Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region has developed technical guidelines for sectoral EA in the
electricity sector, based on its extensive experience in this sector. The guidelines stipulate that a sectoral EA is
recommended where project-specific EAs are not appropriate, due to:
* minimal preparation of individual project components at the time of Bank appraisal (e.g., hydro-power
developments may be at very preliminary stages of planning);
- the nature of the lending operation, such as time-slice operations involving a large number of projects at varying
stages of development; andlor,
* the nature and scale of the projects or programs under consideration.
The guidelines describe the principal sections of a SEA for the power sector: (1) description of the cur-rent situation
of the power sector; (2) review of the country's environmental institutional framework; (3) review of the power
13



sector's regulatory framework and planning procedures; (4) analysis of planned and alternative power sector
strategies; (5) choice of an optimal investment strategy; (6) review of institution-al capacity of power sector
agencies; (7) public consultation; and (8) action plan (for mitigation, management and monitoring).
Box 6. Morocco: Large-Scale Irrigation 11
(Sectoral EA as Part of Sector Planning)
The Government of Morocco and the Bank agreed to conduct a sectoral EA as a complementary activity in the
preparation of this project. Although a full EA or SEA was not required for the proposed project under OD 4.01, both
parties saw the potential added value a SEA could bring to the integration of environmental concerns into the long-
term development of the irrigation sector. Concurrently, the investment component of the project, focusing on the
rehabilitation of existing irrigation infrastructure, was placed in environment screening category B and was thus the
subject of a field-based environmental review. A joint venture of two French consulting firms, financed with a
Japanese grant, was hired (following a competitive selection process) to prepare both the SEA and the
environmental review.
The SEA examined the long-term environmentaf implications of proposed future investments in the sector;
evaluated environmental concems associated with system operation and maintenance; and analyzed institutional,
legal and regulatory aspects. The SEA proposed an environmental management frame-work focused on
development of environmental units for irrigation at both the national and district levels. Support for the initial phase
of implementation of the institutional strengthenlng and training recommend-ed in the SEA was included in the
project. It should be noted that the SEA preparation and review process resulted in significantly increased
awareness of the diversity and complexity of environmental issues in this sector by the Moroccan study
coordinators and participants.
The SEA provided an analysis of legal, regulatory and institutional aspects of environmental management in the
irrigation sector, including recommendations for: (1) creation of new institutions responsible for policy and strategy
formulation, environmental monitoring, and training; and (2) development of new laws and regulations for improving
management and overall performance in the sector. Major technical activities recommended in the SEA included:
(1) protection of watersheds; (2) water use planning; (3) soil conservation; (4) protection of ecologically sensitive
habitats and species; (5) public health programs and monitoring; and (6) training and special studies.

ANNEX 8
PUBLIC CONSULTATION AND DISCLOSURE PLAN - GUIDELINES
1






Public Consultation and Disclosure Plan - Guidelines
Public Consultation as part of an Environmental Assessment
In accordance with World Bank policy, a Sectoral Assessment has been implemented. Public
consultation is an integral part of the Environmental Assessment process, when a project specific or
sectoral EA is being implemented. However, since SEA covers an entire forest sector in national
context and is conducted before concrete investment decisions are made, at this level, it was not
possible to consult representatives of all potentially concerned people during preparation of this SEA.
Obviously, successful consultation process will help ensure public support for the final forest sector
program. Therefore, in the beginning of the study potential stakeholders were identified and
consultations were held.
The purpose of public consultation during an SEA is two-fold. First, consultation during the SEA
preparation process helps to identify key environmental issues and provides information on
stakeholders' concerns about and views of potential cumulative environmental impacts of development
of various scenarios of the investment program. Second, consultation allows stakeholders to review
findings and comment on proposed mitigation and management options.
Levels of Consultation
The consultation process for the SEA will take place at two levels:
At the national level, consultation with interested government bodies, NGOs, and other interested
members of civil society will take place at both the preparation phase and the disclosure of the SEA
phase.
At the local level, consultation with government authorities, forest users, potentially affected nearby
villagers, and any other interested stakeholders will take place in some depth during the SEA
preparation phase. Public meetings at the regional level will be organized for the second phase of
consultation, when the SEA report is disclosed and discussed.
Phases of Consultation
For the purposes of the SEA, consultation will take place in the following way:
SEA preparation: During the SEA preparation, consultation will take place with key stakeholders at the
local level. These include:
* Local branches of the State Department of Forest Management
* Local branches of the Ministry of Environment
* Local branches or agencies of relevant State Authorities (State Department of Geology,
Roads, Protected Areas, Land Management, etc.);
* Local government authorities
* Village Councils nearby forest who might be affected by the project implementation
* NGOs active in the relevant local areas
* Forest farms
* Wood processing enterprises
* Forest users (private companies)
* Any other stakeholders identified through the consultation process
List of stakeholders interviewed to date is given in Annex 1.
2



At the national level, consultation will also take place on a general project input level in Tbilisi.
Consultation with an interested audience will be undertaken as a method of disclosing information
about the project and the SEA, and receiving feedback on either the process or specific aspects of the
project.
EIA of Proposed Projects in the Forest Sector
Once the concrete investment decisions are made and project is finalized, EIA of the proposed project
must be implemented according to the national legislation and the World Bank guidelines described in
Operational Policy 4.01 "Environmental Assessment". EIA of the specific projects must focus on
potential impacts of the proposed project and develop mitigation measures to ensure that the project
options are sound and sustainable. EIA is expected to inform all stakeholders and decision makers on
the nature of the environmental risks and consult representatives of all potentially affected people
during preparation of the study.
Disclosure and Discussion of Draft EIA Report: When the draft EIA report is complete, it should be
sent directly to a group of key stakeholders, which will be identified during the first phase of
consultation (as it was done during SEA). A non-technical summary should be written, translated into
Georgian and made widely available through government and non-government networks at the
national and local level. Meetings with key stakeholders at the national and local level should be held
to discuss the EIA report in order to get reaction and feedback to the environmental management
options proposed in the draft report. Additionally, a series of public meetings (provisionally in Tbilisi
and on site) could be held, and advertised to the public at large in order to disclose the draft EIA and
the proposed environmental management plan.
Methods
The following methods could be used for disclosing and discussing project information:
 leaflet with basic project information (Text of project flyer see below),
-  small group meetings,
*  briefings/workshops at the regional/national level, and
*  non-technical summary/executive summary of the EA report.
Meetings at the local level can be organized with the assistance of local offices of the State
Department of Forest Management and government authorities. Meetings at the national and regional
level can be organized through invitation to specific workshops, and through open advertisement using
print media and radio of public meetings.
The non-technical summary of the draft EIA report should be distributed to identify interested parties
and should be made available at appropriate locations, such as government offices, libraries, town
halls, and other sites identified during the consultation process. The public should be notified of the
availability of the non-technical summary through appropriate media, such as posters at the local level
and through newspaper and radio advertisements at the national level.
On-going Consultation
Given that consultation is a process, this Public Consultation and Disclosure plan should be updated
as the consultation process proceeds in order to identify specifically which stakeholders should receive
what kind of information, and what mechanisms should be used to keep interested parties and
stakeholders informed of and included in the process.

GEORGIA
FORESTS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SECTORAL ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
(Project Preparation Grant JPN 25144-GE)
Terms of Reference
1.     Introductioni. The Government of Georgia (GoG) has requested that the World Bank (the Bank) ) provide
support for a Forests Development Project (the Project). This Project will help the GoG to establish sound forest
management systems that would maximize the contribution of Georgia's forests to economic development and rural
poverty reduction on an environmentally sustainable basis. The Project is of critical importance to Georgia's forests
and people. With the enactment of the new Forest Code of Georgia in June 1999, Georgia has adopted a legal
framework and roadmap for transition to market principles of forest economy, including its possible privatization,
while safeguarding the critical environmental, social and cultural functions of the nation's forests. The Project that
will be implemented in 2001-2008 is designed to provide critical support to this ambitious transition. The total
project cost estimate is about USS30 million dollars equivalent and will be financed by the GoG, the World Bank,
Japan and, possibly, the European Union and other international and bilateral donors.
2.      To support preparation of the proposed Project, the GoG seeks the services of internationally qualified
consultant(s) to prepare a Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SEA) ' which will be consistent with the GoG
environmental procedul-cs and the requiremenlts of the Bank as outlinied in Operational Policy 4.01 "Environmental
Assessment" (attachment A).
3.      The project has been placed in the Bank environmental screening category "B." However, the GoG seeks to
undertake a Sectoral Environmental Assessment which will also fulfill the requirements of the Bank's
environmental screening category "A," including information disclosure and public consultations. As a significant
focus of Project implementation is to promote policy development, it is expected analyses on the sectoral
environmental impact will continue as policies and forests-related programs evolve.
4.    Backgrounld Informationt. The proposed Forests Development Project is expected to be appraised by the
World Bank in March 2001 and submitted for World Bank's Board approval in July 2001. The Project will have the
following five complementary and inter-related components:
(a)     development and improvement of nationalforest policies, laws and regulations (including forest
sector institutional reorganization plans and financial system reform plans);
(b)     development and improvement offorest management planning systems (including forest inventory,
landscape-ecological zoning and environmental and social assessments for forest conservation and
multiple-purpose use, forest management information systems, economic valuation and pricing of
forest resources, effective forest fire and pest management, reforestation and afforestation, and
community participation in forest management);
(c)     strengthening of forest sector institutions and human r esources development (including training
and re-training of professional forest management staff, forest research and education, public
awareness campaigns for rural communities and general population);
(d)     support to private sector in sustainable forest management and utilizationi (including assistance
with development and demonstration of environmentally sustainable forest harvesting and
transportation techniques, training in forest road planning, maintenance and rehabilitation, training
in preparation of environmental impact assessments and public consultations for private projects);
and,
Depending on the project, a range of instruments can be used to satisfy the Bank's EA requirement: environmental
impact assessment (EIA), regional or sectoral EA, environmental audit, hazard or risk assessment, and environmental
management plan (EMP). When the project is likely to have sectoral or regional impacts, sectoral or regional EA is required. A
Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SEA) is an instrument which offers opportunities for sector-wide environmental analysis
and support integration of environmental concems into long-term development and investment planning. SEAs are particularly
suited for reviewing (a) the effect of sectoral policy changes; (b) sector investment alternatives; (c) institutional capacity and
requirements for environmental review, implementation and monitoring at the sectoral level; and (d) cumulative impacts of many
relatively small, similar investments which by themselves may not appear to have significant environmental impact. World Bank
guidance on sectoral EA can be found in OP 4.01, the Environmental Assessment Sourcebook (1991) and the October 1993
Environmental Assessment Sourcebook Update (Number 4).

(e)    promotion of sustainable use of non-woodforest products (including development of sustainable
hunting and ecotourism in forest ecosystems).
5.    Substantial technical work detailing each component was completed in 1998-99 by the SFD together with the
FAO specialists. Additional preparation work (including Overall forest utilization planning, Social Assessment, and
this Sectoral EA study) is being financed by a Japanese project preparation grant and has to be completed before
project appraisal. The remaining critical preparation and start-up activities for the Project including: (i)
development of improved forest policies and regulations; (ii) development of improved forest management planning
and protection techniques; and (iii) project implementation capacity building - are being funded through a project
preparation advance (PPF) in September 2000 to July 2001.
6.     Project implementation will be carried out in the following way. The Forestry Development Fund (FDF) -
a project preparation unit established under the SFD that is currently administefing the Japanese Grant, will be used
as the core of the new Project Management Unit (PMU) that will be established in August-September 2000 by a
decree of the President of Georgia. Administration of the remainder of the Japanese grant will also be transferred to
this new entity. The PMU will be established as a legal person under Georgia's civil law and its Executive Director
will be nominated by the Ministry of Finance and SFD and appointed by the President. The PMU will report to a
twelve-member Supervisory Board that will include representatives of the Ministries of Economy, Finance,
Agriculture, and Environment, SFD, State Department of Protected Areas, State Department of Land Management,
Parliamentary Committee on Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, Georgian Academy of Sciences, and
non-governmental organizations.
7.     Thc first stage of thc Projcct will focus on implementing land-usc and forcst management planning
activities agreed to by all interested stakeholders during project preparation and early stages of implementation.
After sufficient dialogue and analyses, later stages of implementation will focus more directly on forest sector
investments, with an increasingly important role played by the private sector. Work on land-use planning and forest
management information systems will, however, continue for the duration of the Project and beyond. An
environmental management plan (EMP) for project implementation will have to be developed as part of this study.
This EMP will provide a process by which specific environmental impact assessments will be conducted for each of
the Project's subcomponents before they are financed by the Bank. Guidelines for sustainable forest management in
a format that can act as a sourcebook for forest managers and which are consistent with the FAO Model Code of
Forest Harvesting Practice will also be developed during project implementation. These will include not only
guidelines for environmentally friendly silvicultural and harvesting operations, but also guidelines for the EIA of
forestry practices on forest biodiversity, ecosystems-based inventories, but also for the establishment of forest lands
Landscapc Ecological Networks. Thesc will culminate in the preparation of sustainable forest management 10-year
plan guidelines.
8.     The Implementing Agency for the Project is the Georgian State Department of Forest Management.
Financing for Project preparation commenced in July, 1998. Significant analysis (including legal analysis) and
proposals for Project financing were developed in partnership with FAO. A Social Assessment was carried out in
August-December 1999 and its results were published in July 2000. The World Bank is also preparing the GEF-
financed Georgia Protected Areas Development Project (PADP) in coordination with the Forests Development
Project.
9.     It is envisaged that the FD Project will be appraised in March 2001 and presented to the World Bank Board
of Directors in July 2001, before becoming effective in October 2001. The SEA must therefore be completed before
February 2001 so that the findings and recommendations can be incorporated into Project design before its appraisal.
10.    Objectives. The objectives of the SEA are to (i) analyze the policy, legal and administrative framework
relevant to the forest sector and make recommendations for reform if needed; (ii) identify major environmental and
social issues related to the development of the forest sector; (ii) collect baseline data in relation to these
environmental and social issues and their trends; (iii) analyze potential impacts from proposed Project activities vis a
vis alternative programs, particularly for long-term sustainable development, and make recommendations for
mitigation if necessary; (iv) analyze in-country capacity for environmental management and assessment in the
sector; (v) provide general guidelines for long-term sector-wide environmental monitoring; and (vi) assist in inter-
agency coordination and public/NGO consultation process.
11.    Environmental Assessment Requirements. The following regulations and guidelines should guide the
assessment and assist in specifying the content of the final report:
*   World Bank Operational Policy (OP) and Bank Procedure (BP) 4.01: Environmental Assessment;
*   World Bank Operational Policies on Forestry (4.36), Natural Habitats (OP 4.04), and Cultural
Heritage (OP 4.1 1);



Georgia Forests Development Project               - 4 -              Sectoral Environmental Assessment
Terms-of-Reference
*    Law of Georgia on State Environmental Assessment
*    Other national, region provincial or communal laws and/or regulations on environmental reviews
and impact assessments;
*    Draft Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan
*    World Bank Environmental Assessment Sourcebook (1991) and the October 1993 Environmental
Assessment Sourcebook Update (Number 4).
12.    Scope of 11ork. The SEA should be carried out in an open and participatory manner involving
consultations with all the major stakeholders. Specific tasks will include the following:
13.     Task 1. Pr-oect description and identification of major environmental and social issues related to the
development of the forest sector and the Project.
14.     Task 2. Baseline data and inoiitorina. Assemble, evaluate and present baseline data in relation to these
environmental and social issues, and include information on any changes anticipated in the near future. Whereas a
project-specific EA would describe impacts around a proposed project site, the SEA should concentrate on the issues
and problems that are typical of the sector as a whole. This may include information on the physical environment,
biological environment and socio-cultural environment. It may also include the identification and current
management practices on ecological[y sensitive areas, information on land and resource use (including non-timber
forest products), systems of land tenure and resource use rights, extent and causes of illegal harvesting at the
community level, existing and planned development activities. A more detailed subset of baseline data shall be
assemblcd and evaluated at a local (district) lcvel - for thc territory of the Oni District - using the results of the
Overall forest utilization planning and the Landscape-ecological zoning undertaken in 1998-2000. The consultant(s)
should also closely review the results of the Social Assessment undertaken by other consultant(s). This section of
the SEA will also identify major data gaps.
15.     Task 3. Policv. Lezal and Administrative Framework. Identify and analyze both the (a) national
environmental legal, regulatory and institutional framework and (b) sector-specific policies, regulations and
institutions, and make recommendations for future needs or changes.
16.    The relevant national environmental policies, laws and regulations should be assessed for their
completeness and appropriateness in light of the conditions and problems of the sector, and gaps and weaknesses
noted. Non-environmental laws and policies that have significant for the sector's utilization of resources and/or
production processes should also be identified. These may include legislation related to land restitution, tenure
systems, private sector development, enforcemcnit, judicial system or custonms. Similarly the regulatory framework
for EA preparation and review of forest scctor investments should be assessed (see Task 5).
17.    The SEA should also analyze current and proposed forest sector-specific policies, laws and regulations that
have environmental implications. To some degree, analysis of the Forest Code which was approved in June 1999 by
the Georgian Parliament has already been started by the FAO during project preparation. However, numerous
subsidiary regulations are being developed to support this Forest Code, and the SEA should help to identify any gaps
in these implementing regulations that are critical to support sustainable forest management (SFM). In addition, the
impact of the recent (1998-99) temporary ban on commercial logging vis-a-vis alternatives should be analyzed, with
suggestions made for regulatory and/or other adjustments that would be needed to ensure that the effective lifting of
this ban after approval of the 1999 Forest Code does not lead to the acceleration of unsustainable harvesting
practices.
18.    The SEA should also identify how environmental responsibilities are distributed among (public or private)
institutions and assess their capacity to administer these tasks. The State Forest Department's investment planning
process, in terms of objectives, methodology and procedures for review and approval of plans and projects, should
be carefully reviewed. The SEA should assess whether environmental and social issues are adequately covered by
current procedures.
19.     Task 4. Analyze potential impacts from proposed forest sector development scenarios (includinz those
outlined bv the FD Project). While one challenge for SEAs is to produce a sufficiently precise impact analysis in the
face of evolving policy development, this section of the SEA should focus on (a) comparison of alternative forest
sector development scenarios proposed during project preparation by the GoG and FAO, including a "do-nothing
alternative;' (b) short-term and long-term effects of various harvesting scenarios on forest structure, watersheds and
biodiversity; (c) short-term and long-term effects of logging roads; (d) likely impacts of developing community-
forest management systems, and what systems would need to be in place to ensure communities manage their forests
sustainably; and (d) effects of the development of a forests product processing sector.

20.    If these questions cannot be answered immediately, suggest ways in which the Project or the GoG can
eventually obtain this analysis.
21.     Task 5. In-country Environmental Assessment Capacitv. Analysis of capacity within the relevant ministries
or departments to run an effective EA process during forest management planning. This would include a review of
the mandates and capacity of institutions at local, provincial/regional and national levels, and recommend steps to
strengthen or expand them. The recommendations may extend to new laws and regulations, new agencies or agency
functions, inter-ministerial arrangements, management procedures and/or training, staffing and administrative re-
organization.
22.     Task f. Environmental Monitorinjg and Management Plan. The SEA should provide general guidelines for
long-term sector-wide environmental monitoring, the Forest Management lnfornation Systern (FMIS) which is to
be funded under the Project as well as processes by which the environmental impact of any potential future forestry
operations will be assessed. Based on the informational gaps identified in the baseline data sections, the plan should
also recommend measures needed to collect and organize missing data. A monitoring plan should use the findings of
the baseline data sections to measure progress.
23.     Task 7. Consultationi. Assist in inter-agency coordination and public/NGO participation. Coordinate the
SEA with other government agencies, in obtaining the view of local NGOs and affected groups, in keeping records
of meetings au.l other activities, communications, and comments and their disposition.
24.    Report. The SEA should be concise and limited to significant environmental issues. The main text should
focus on findings, conclusions and recommendations supported by summaries of the data collected and citations for
anly re-cfrences uscd in intcrpreting those data. Detailed Or un1inteC-preted data shIould be presented in appendices or a
separatc volumc. The report should be presentcd in English as well as in Georgian languages. The SEA should be

Note: A Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SEA) is an instrument which offers opportunities for sector-wide envirofnmetital analysis and support integration of environmental concems into long-term development and investment
planning. The SEA therefore attempts to take a broader, landscape view of sector-wide developmlent - anid does not foctis as much on investment-specific environmental impacts (an investment-specific EA will be conducted within the
scope of the eardy phase of the Project itself before these investmenits are financed by the Bank at the second phase of the Pt oject)
