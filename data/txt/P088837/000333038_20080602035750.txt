               and level repayment o f principal.
Tranching      Single tranche to be disbursedon effectiveness.
Description    The PPDPL series supports a sustained medium-term process of
               legal, institutional, and structural development that promotes
               growth, improves public governance and service delivery and
               strengthens social conditions by (a) maintaining an enabling
               macroeconomic framework; (b) reforming the country's social
               protection system, (c) continuing the ongoing process o f upgrading
               financial controls and public expenditure management, and (d)
               improving the administration and governance o f the public sector.

               The government's program supported by the Loan contains
               actions, milestones, and expected results in each of the above four
               broad areas o f public policy. This reform program supports a
               substantial portion o f the authorities' strategy to improve public
               service delivery and public institutions. Accordingly, PPDPL 2
               (Euro 255.4 million) i s designed around four program areas and
               contains prior actions and triggers supporting actions critical to
               achieving program objectives. The authorities and the Bank have
               agreed to follow PPDPL 2 with a third operation (PPDPL 3) as the
               achievement o f the program objectives depends critically on
               consistent implementation and further deepening o f structural
               reforms supported under the PPDPL series.

               The first component of PPDPL 2 supports the macroeconomic
               framework that has underpinned Turkey's recovery and strong
               growthafter the 2001 crisis, with an aim to ensure sustainability of
               growth and mitigate risks arising from a complex and dynamic
               external environment.

               The second component focuses on improving the quality o f fiscal
               adjustment as well as social protection through parametric pension



                                        1

            reform, implementation o f administrative reforms intended to
            strengthen administrative capacity, and supporting efficiency-
            increasing and cost-saving measures in the health system in order
            to contain pressures inhealth expenditures.

            The third component supports sustained implementation of the
            Public Financial Management and Control (PFMC) Law that has
            underpinned the outstanding         improvements in the pub1,ic
            expenditure management system in Turkey. The areas supported
            focus on establishing strategy development units in all government
            institutions,   introducing accrual     basis  accounting for     the
            government, and improving the link between policy objectives,
            resources allocationprocess and the public investment.

            The     fourth   component      supports    improvements    in the
            administration and governance o f the public sector through actions
            intended to reduce regional disparities, improve quality o f public
            delivery at local level, and improve the justice system. The areas
            supported focus on increasing the efficiency and the quality o f
            judicial services, including increasing resources available to the
            judiciary, institutional and structural changes (such as the
            establishment o f Regional Courts o f Appeal) and modernization o f
            thejudiciary through upgrading of infrastructure and automation.
Benefits    The     potential   benefits   are   substantial.     An enabling
            macroeconomic framework will continue to be an important
            underlyingdriver for the sustained growth experienced by Turkey
            since 2002.

            Improving the legal and institutional dimensions o f public
            expenditure management (PEM) will enable prioritization and
            efficient use o f public resources and will contribute to creating
            fiscal space for growth promoting expenditures such as in
            education and infrastructure. Implementation o f the PEM reforms
            will increase transparency and accountability in the public sector
            as well as comparability o f the fiscal aggregates at international
            level. Ultimately it i s expected to help improve the credit ratings
            o f Turkey's foreign-currency denominated debt and reduce the risk
            premia on domestic debt, which would reduce the cost o f debt
            servicing.

            The reformed social protection system is expected to provide
            insurance against old age, poverty, illhealth, and more effective
            and better targeted social assistance to the poor, while ensuringthe
            financial viability o f better access to these services. The reforms
            will lead to fiscally sustainable and equitable system.

         Better focused regional development efforts and more effective
         provision o f public services at the local level will contribute to
         increase income levels inthe lagging regions, improving quality o f
         local service delivery and facilitating more effective utilization o f
         pre-accession funds from the European Union (EU).

         Improvements in the justice system and anti-cormption efforts are
         expected to reduce obstacles to economic and social development.
         An effective and efficient judicial system is important to the
         provision o f public services. In addition, justice sector reforms
         help to safeguard citizens' rights and implementthe EU legislation
         that i s essential in the EUaccession process. Improving the quality
         o f judicial services i s also an important factor in enhancing the
         investmentclimate inTurkev.
Risks    The Turkish economy faces non-negligible risks. On the external
         front, the current account deficit (CAD) continues to be a source o f
         concern - although it i s estimated to have narrowed slightly to 5.7
         percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in2007 from 6.1 percent
         in2006.

         Other risk factors include changes in investor sentiment in
         financial markets and their effect on public debt sustainability,
         spillovers from global liquidity tightening, or fallout from US sub-
         prime mortgage market distress.        These factors would affect
         Turkey's economic situation because o f the public debt which has
         a relatively short maturity and i s relatively sensitive to exchange
         and interest rate movements.        Nevertheless, it has decreased
         substantially as a share o f GDP since 2001 and i s expected to
         continue to decrease under a baseline projection. The episodes o f
         turmoil in international financial markets during May-June 2006
         and February 2007 and their impact on domestic markets both
         showed that Turkey i s still vulnerable to sudden changes in
         investors' sentiment, and that Turkey's resilience to shocks has
         substantially increased.      The Turkish economy has broadly
         weathered well the most recent volatility in international markets
         since August 2007 untiltoday.

         Following a successful constitutional challenge to an earlier draft
         o f the Social Security and UHI(UHI) Law in 2006, there i s a non-
         negligible risk that the recently approved revised law will be
         challenged before the Constitutional court again. The government
         has moved to make the new law consistent with the Constitution
         but some risk o f an adverse ruling remains. The proposedprogram
         leaves time for constitutional review and finalization o f the

                                   ...
                                   111

necessary secondary legislation. Implementation o f the law would
be monitored under a subsequent PPDPL 3. Additionally, the
reform program contains actions, such as implementation o f the
administrative reform o f the social security system, which raise
considerable challenges during the transition to a new system.
Containment o f health expenditures i s also a sensitive issue, as
there i s often a fine line between providing health services to
society and to the poor in particular, and containing unnecessary
spendingor reducing inefficiencies inspending.

The possibility of phasing out in2008 o fthe program supported by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and of a slower EU
accession process, if realized, could weaken anchors o f policy
reform that untilnow helpedunderpineconomic policies.

Finally, a recent case filed with the Constitutional Court calling for
the dissolution of the ruling party Justice and Development Party
(AKP) could create risks for reform implementations.

                                    I. INTRODUCTION

1.       The Turkish government embarked on an extensive structural reform program as a
response to the 2001 severe economic crisis and inorder to break away from the instabilities and
inefficiencies o f the past decade. The weak public governance, inadequate public expenditure
management and weak public institutions created an environment for populist policies and
growing macro-fiscal imbalances. Increasingfragilities inthe macroeconomic structure owing to
the fiscal and monetary policies implemented during the 1990s moved the Turkish economy
away from the stable growth path. Inappropriate policies implemented in social security, State
Owned Economic Enterprises (SEE), and agricultural support resultedin serious deterioration in
public finances. The increasing debt stock and the resultant high real interest rate environment
caused inflation to become chronic on the one hand, and domestic savings to be directed towards
financing public deficits rather than funding productive investments, on the other hand. The
Turkish government responded to the 2001 crisis with a well-designed economic program of
tight monetary, fiscal, and incomes policies and wide ranging structural reforms in order to
address the challenges raised by the severe economic crisis.
2.       With the determined implementation o f the reform program, the Turkish economy has
gone through significant structural changes initiated to restore macroeconomic stability
permanently and make the economy more efficient, flexible and productive A strong fiscal
adjustment with a large public sector primary surplus target has been at the center o f the
economic program implemented since then. The fiscal adjustment has been accompanied by
ongoing implementation o f a comprehensive long-term government program to modernize the
institutions and procedures o f public sector management. The process o f EU accession that was
launched on October 3, 2005 has also become a driving force for the continuation and deepening
o f these reforms.    Consistent with these needs, the authorities have adopted a program o f
sustained medium-term legal, institutional, and structural developments aimed at promoting
growth, improving public service delivery, strengthening public governance and judicial system
and reforming social security system.
3.      To support the authorities in key fronts o f this agenda, the Bank's Board approved the
Public Sector Development Policy Loan, designed to support policy actions within the overall
government program inkey areas. The first PPDPL (Euro 403 million) in support o f this program
was approved in June, 2006. This document presents the second operation inthis series (PPDPL
2). Similar to the first operation, PPDPL 2 supports policy actions in four areas, to (a) maintain
an enabling macroeconomic framework; (b) reform the country's social protection system, (c)
upgrade public financial controls and expenditure management systems, and (d) improve the
administration and governance o f the public sector.

                                  11.     COUNTRY CONTEXT


OVERVIE w
4.      Turkey has been experiencing strong growth since 2002 - driven in part by the
government's commitment to sound economic policies and a benign international economic
environment. Annual growth averaged 6.8 percent in the period 2002-2007. Output increased
more than a third in this period - the strongest growth performance among Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) members. The implementation o f tight fiscal
and monetary policies has contributed to a considerable reduction in inflation and improvement
inpublic debt sustainability. Considerable progress has also been achieved in restructuring the
financial sector, improving the business environment, and reforming the public sector.
5.      Good policies and credible external anchors have been critical for Turkey's economic
success since the 2001 crisis.     Turkey's impressive economic performance is due first and
foremost to credible and sustained stabilization, with strong fiscal discipline at its core, combined
with an ongoing structural reform agenda. IMF and WBG support o f the reform programs and
the beginning of the EU accession negotiations in 2005, constituted the external anchors of the
successful program.
6.      The authorities have implemented major reforms over the past six years. Substantial
progress has been achieved in reducing inflation and real interest rates, improving public
finances, restructuring the financial sector, improving the business environment, and reforming
the public sector. Key markets have beenliberalized and regulatory capacity inthe economy has
been strengthened-including      banking supervision. Strong fiscal and monetary policies helped
improve debt sustainability as well as lower inflation and inflationary expectations. Stability,
predictability, and market confidence have improved. Convergence with EU levels o f income per
capita i s on-going which-if    maintained-would      represent a significant break from past short-
lived economic booms followed by downturns.
7.      Fiscal performance has been strong since 2002, notwithstanding a loosening earlier in
2007. The primary surplus for the public sector averaged 4.5 percent o f GDP inthe period 2002-
07. The size o f the fiscal adjustment i s unprecedented and its effects on the economy have been
very positive, Nonetheless, the quality o f fiscal adjustment could be improved as the primary
surpluses were obtained mostly by increasing taxes and reducing the expenditures o f State
Owned Enterprises (SOEs). Expenditurerationalization inthe rest o f the general government has
been limited. The large majority o f public expenditures remain inflexible, including the public
sector wage bill, transfers to cover the social security deficit, and servicing o f public debt. This
means the state has limitedability to invest ingrowth enhancing areas.
8.      The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) used short-term interest rates as the
main instrumentto influence inflation expectations together with targets for monetary aggregates.
After reaching the historically low level of 7.7 percent inflation at the end of 2005, explicit inflation
targeting was adopted in January 2006. However, inflation has remained above the official
targets since then.

9.         Inparliamentary elections inJuly 2007, Turkey's governing party (AKP) won an absolute
majority in Parliament and a renewed mandate to form a single party government. The new
Government i s committed to pursuing an ambitious program o f economic and institutional
reforms.
10.        Despite the good economic performance o f the past years, macroeconomic vulnerabilities
remain. So far Turkey has weathered the recent uncertainties and the ongoing market volatility
originating from US sub-primemortgage losses, demonstrating much improved resilience o f the
economy. Nevertheless, the Turkish economy still faces significant risks arising from: (i)its
large CAD, at 5.7 percent o f GDP at end-2007; (ii)its public debt - which has a relatively short
maturity and i s relatively sensitive to exchange and interest rate movements; (iii)the moderating
fiscal policy stance inthe wake o f weakening global conditions; and, (iv) the slowing disinflation
process. Highreturnson Turkishassets have brought large international flows to the country and
the resultant increase in exposure of foreign investors in Turkish assets has made the economy
more vulnerable to changes in global risk appetite. The possible materialization o f these risks
hinges on international as well as domestic events.
11.        The prospect o f Turkey's EU accession remains a key anchor o f political and economic
reforms. The EU accession negotiations were formally launched in October 2005. The EU
accession negotiations provide impetus for deepening and broadening the reforms required for
Turkey's convergence to the EU average income per capita.                                   Notwithstanding temporary
setbacks, the EU harmonization agenda and accession process are expected to continue in the
years ahead. Indeed, the Government has prepared a six-year program o f economic, social, and
institutional harmonization with the EUAcquis Communitaire. Inits Action Plan, dated October
8, 2007, the Government reiterated its commitment to implement EU-related reforms,


                                                                     3

highlighting their importance for Turkey's own development. Negotiations on one chapter,
science and research, were opened and provisionally closed in June 2006. As of March 2008,
negotiations on five out o f 35 chapters of the EUAcquis Communitaire were open.
RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS                   IN TURKEY
12.      Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT) released the long-awaited revision to GDP
data on March 8, 2008. The mainreasonfor this revision was to reflect structural changes in the
economy since 1987 in national accounts statistics. Another reason was to harmonize Turkey's
GDP estimates with the European System of Accounts (ESA) 95.                TURKSTAT plans to
complete full alignment with the ESA 95 by 2011. The recent revision updates the base year to
1998 from 1987, and includes both changes in methodology and coverage'. With this revision,
historical GDP series - both in real and nominal terms - have changed significantly.         For
instance, Turkey's 2006 GDP has beenrevisedup by 31.6 percent innominal terms.
13.      Based on the revised figures, annual GDP growth averaged 6.8 percent in the period
2002-2007 on the back of robust private consumption and investment demand (Table 2). In
2007, the Turkish economy grew at a healthy pace - albeit slower than in previous years, in part
driven by imports outpacing exports and deceleration of domestic demand, reflecting lagged
impact of the monetary policy tightening that followed the volatility of May-June 2006. GDP
reached US$658.8 billion, and GDP per capita reachedUS$9,333 in2007. Real GDP growth i s
expectedto remainmodest at around 4 percent in2008.

14.      Turkey's large CAD remains as a source of concern. Together with the strong recovery in
the economy, the deficit began widening in 2003. It continued deteriorating due to rising oil
prices and the growing trade imbalance fueled large capital inflows. A strong recovery of private
investment and the buoyancy of domestic demand also contributed to a growing deficit. After
reaching a record high of 6.1 percent of GDP in 2006, the CAD-to-GDP ratio narrowed slightly
to 5.7 percent in 2007 - in part as a consequence of a slowdown of domestic demand and
moderate recovery in tourism revenues (Figure 1). Nevertheless, the CAD i s expected to widen
to around 6.5 percent of GDP in2008 on the back of increasing energy and commodity prices.

15.      Despite the widening inthe CAD, the quality of its financing has improved considerably.
Short-term inflows accounted for only 6 percent of total net inflows in 2007, compared to 55
percent in 2004. Non-debt creating flows covered more than 50 percent of the CAD in2007. In
particular,    net   Foreign    Direct
Investment (FDI) flows amounted                 Figure 1: Total and Non-oil CAD ( percent of GDP)
to US$ 9 billion (1.9 percent of
GDP) in 2005, and reached a
historical high of US$ 19.8 billion
in 2007 (3 percent of GDP). Net
FDI flows are projected to remain
robust in 2008 at about 1.7 percent
of GDP. Nonetheless, the share of
debt-creating     inflows    i s  still
considerable.

totaled US$76 billion, and accountedfor about 30 percent of the bond market, and 71 percent of
the equity market as of March2008 (Figure 2).
17.      Fiscal performance has beenstrong since 2002, notwithstanding a loosening in2007. The
public sector primary surplus averaged 4.5 percent of GDP in the period 2002-07. The fiscal
performance was relatively weak in 2007-partly        driven by expenditure overruns inthe first half
of the year.       In addition, lower than expected tax revenues also contributed to the
underperformance       as   economic
activity slowed down in 2007. The        Figure 2: Foreign Holdings of Equities and Government Bonds

entire public sector generated a
primary surplus of 3.5 percent of
GDP in 2007.             The central

2008. When calculated using the

Nevertheless, the authorities reducedthe primary surplus target to 3.5 percent of GDP during the
seventh and final review of the IMF Stand-By Arrangement (SBA), inpart because of anticipated
higher transfers to local administrations, expected implementation of the labor market reform,
and higher plannedinfrastructure investment.

 18.    Inflation started to pick up in 2006 increasing to 9.7 percent-significantly               higher than
the official target of 5 percent. In2007, Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation lost momentum -
albeit not enough to meet the annual target, as it declined to 8.4 percent. The CBRT has
announced its commitment to bring inflation down to 4 percent in the period 2008-2010.
Nevertheless, the annual CPI inflation was on an upward path in the first four months of 2008,
mainly driven by increases in food and          - Figure 3: Target Path and ActualiExpected Inflation in
energy prices. The annual CPI inflation is                                    2008

21.     Although the risks are non-negligible, there have been considerable improvements in
Turkey's key vulnerability indicators over the last six years - namely: (a) the cost of borrowing
has declined; (b) the annual inflation rate has declined sharply; (c) the composition and maturity
of public debt have improved; (d) debt management practices have strengthened; and (e) the
public debt-to-GDP ratios have declinednoticeably.
22.     Turkey's substantial foreign exchange reserves and flexible exchange rate regime
mitigate risks associated with capital reversals. Foreign exchange (FX) reserves of the CBRT
increased from US$19.8 billion in 2001 to US$74 billion in 2007. Reserves represented 55

percent of gross external financing requirements in 2006 and more than covered Turkey's short-
term external debt in the first half of 2007. Turkey's flexible exchange rate regime has helped
cushion outflows during periods of volatility.
23.     Relationship with the IMF: The IMF approved a three-year Special Drawing Rights
(SDR) 6.7 billion (US$ 10.8 billion) SBA to support Turkey's economic and financial program
in May 2005. The program envisioned low single digit inflation and 10 percentage point
reduction in the government's net debt to GDP ratio. On May 9, 2008, the IMF Board approved
the completion of the seventh and final review of the SBA and the disbursementof the remaining
SDR 2.25 billion (US$3-65 billion). Consequently, the three-year SBA has been successfully
completed.
MACROECONOMIC ANDDEBTSUSTAINABILITY'
                     OUTLOOK

24.     Over the medium term, it is expected that Turkey should sustain growth rates of around 5
percent, as envisaged by the government and the IMF. Conditions are in place for Turkey to
sustain such growth rates. The strong growth in private investment expenditure in the period
2004-2007 - despite a slowdown in 2007, and the robust industrial production growth starting
from the last quarter of 2005 are indicative of the improved prospects for sustained growth and
employment generation. Although the recently emerging difficulties in the electricity sector due
to growing demand and underinvestment in the sector are likely to pose risks for future growth,
the Government i s taking a number of measures to address the potential supply-demand
imbalance and to ensure an adequate and reliable supply of electricity, as well as efficiency inits
consumption. The Bank will provide support to the Government's strategy through its electricity
sector Development Policy Loan (DPL) which is plannedfor the second half of 2008.
25.     The medium-term projection of economic growth averaging 5 percent annually during
2008-2013 i s underpinned by: (a) strong external anchors, supporting enhanced confidence inthe
policy framework; (b) improved macroeconomic stability, which would stimulate private
investment and consumption demand; (c) stronger export performance, which would permit
faster import and output growth; and (d) strong external inflows, includingFDI.
26.     After a slight improvement in 2007, the CAD-to-GDP ratio is projected to widen to
around 6.4 percent of GDP in 2008 - in part due to an expected increase in commodity and oil
prices. Turkey needs to generate enough medium and long term capital inflows to meet its large
levels of external financing requirements, while keeping short-term debt inflows at prudent
levels. Net FDI flows reached US$ 19.8 billion in 2007 and is projected to remain strong at
about US$ 12.5 billion per year on average over 2008-2012-a              major contribution to the
country's mediumterm external financing requirements.
27.     Public debt sustainability. The net public debt to GDP ratio fell from a high of 66.5
percent in 2001 to 29.1 percent in 2007. The net debt ratio i s projected to fall further in 2008-
2012. Realization of this outcome depends on sustained growth, continued fiscal discipline as
represented by primary surpluses of around 3 percent of GDP, stable exchange rates and a
favorable external environment. However, public debt stock is still sensitive to interest and
exchange rate movements as a considerableportion of the central government's domestic debt is

infloating rate notes (50 percent as of end-2007) and a substantial share of total debt stock is in
FX andFX-linkedinstruments(32 percent as of end-2007).
28.      Public debt sustainability hinges on continued fiscal discipline. Sensitivity analyses of
public debt dynamics demonstrate the importance of commitment to sound economic policies.
Under an extreme scenario, characterizedby fiscal loosening, rising interest rates, and a growth
slowdown in 2008-2009, the net public debt ratio would jump to about 39 percent by 2009,
declining only slightly thereafter.

reform on the net public debt ratio
would be zero in the short-term; the
impact would still be negligible in the
medium-term as the cumulative fiscal
savings from the reform are estimated to
be limited to 0.9 percentage points of
GDP      in the       period   2009-2014.     Source: Stafforoiections

Nevertheless, the successful implementation of the reform could positively impact Turkey's
public debt sustainability in the medium-term through an improvement in the country's credit
ratings, which would be reflected in a lower risk premium on the interest paid on public debt.
Over the long term, on the other hand, a setback in the reform would have a negative impact on
the public debt ratio as the cumulative fiscal gains from the reform are estimated at 7.7
percentage points o f GDP in 2009-2025-increasing              the net public debt-to-GDP ratio to 20
percent by 2025 compared to 12 percent in the reform scenario. In the longer-term, the impact
would be even larger as the cumulative fiscal savings from the reform are estimated to be around
200 percentagepoints of GDP in2009-2075.

                          111.   THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

31.      Turkey's economic policy framework and reform program are described in a number of
separate but consistent documents. Turkey's medium-termeconomic policy and reform program
i s articulated in the Ninth Development Plan (2007-2013)' which was published in the Official
Gazette on July 1, 2006. The government follows implementation of the development plans
through its annual programs and the 2008 Annual Program was publishedin October 2007. The
priorities of the current administration were spelled out in the 60th Government Program
presentedto Parliament on August 31,2007 and inthe Action Plan of the government published
on January 10, 2008. Turkey also produces annual EU Pre-Accession Economic Programs that
detail short and medium term policy actions and structural reform priorities related to EU
accession. The 2007 Pre-AccessionProgram, which covers the 2008-2010 period, was submitted
to the EU Commission in December 2007. Moreover, Turkey has moved to medium term
budgeting since 2006, and the third medium term fiscal plan covering the period of 2008-2010
was issued in the Official Gazette dated July 3, 2007. These policy documents are consistent
among themselves.
32.      Key long-term development goals include transforming the country's economic and
social structure in order to become an influential regional economic power, raising the quality of
and access to health and education services, improving income distribution, strengthening
scientific and technological capacity, enhancing effectiveness in infrastructure services and
protecting the environment. The vision i s that of a modern and secular participatory democracy,
fully integrated in the European community, playing a critical role in its region, with an export-
oriented, technology-intensive productive structure. Turkey sees the EU accession process as an
important opportunity for harmonization with international norms and standards.
33.      Inthis context, the NinthDevelopment Planvision is "a Turkey which grows instability,
shares her income more equitably, i s competitive at a global scale, transforms into an information
society and has completed the stage of legal harmonization for EUmembership".
34.      Inorder to achieve this vision, the NinthDevelopment Plan comprisesfive "development
axes" or strategic areas of action, namely: (a) Increasing Competitiveness, (b) Increasing
Employment, (c) Strengthening Human Development and Social Solidarity, (d) Ensuring
Regional Development and (e) Increasing Quality and Efficiency inPublic Services.
35.      The new vision and the related development axes heavily coincide with the development
agenda supportedunder the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The CPS i s shaped directly
by Turkey's NinthDevelopment Plan and by the Government's Program andaims at contributing
to three main development pillars: (i)   improved competitiveness and employment, (ii)     equitable
human and social development, and (iii)    efficient provisionof high-quality public services.
36.      The proposed PPDPL 2 is strongly aligned with the new strategic objectives of the
government; supporting selectively key elements of the Government's Development Plan (see
Annex V).       Strengthening Human Development and Social Solidarity, Ensuring Regional
Development and Increasing Quality and Efjciency in Public Services are the three development
axes supported by PPDPL 2. The program supported by PPDPL 2 i s a subset of the actions
included ineach of these three development axes.




                                                  9

37.     For instance, the Strengthening Human Development and Social Solidarity axis includes
actions aimed at (a) improving the effectiveness of the health system, (b) improving income
distribution, social inclusion and fight against poverty, (c) increasing effectiveness of the social
security system. The Ensuring Regional Development axis includes actions aimed at (a) making
regional development policy effective at the central level, (b) ensuring development based on
local dynamics, and (c) increasing institutional capacity at local level. The Increasing Quality
and Effectiveness in Public Services axis includes actions aimed at (a) improvingjustice system,
(b) increasingpolicy making and implementationcapacity, and (c) developing humanresources
in the public sector. Annex V presents more details about the Ninth Development Plan. The
2008 Annual Program o f the government includes specific actions in each of these areas with a
view to achievingthe objectivesenvisionedinthe NinthDevelopmentPlan.
38.     These program areas were chosen in view of their importance, the quality of the
economic and sector work on the subjects conductedjointly by government and the Bank, their
strong relationship to the CPS objectives, and the close relationship and complementarities
amongthemselves which allows combiningthese elements into a coherent package of reforms.


             IV.     BANKSUPPORTTO THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY

LINKTO CPS
39.     A new CPS was endorsedby the Bank's Executive Directors on February28, 2008. The
goal of the new CPS for FY08-11i s for the Bank Group to be a partner with Turkey inrealizing
her development vision-to       achieve fast and sustained growth with equity-through           full
integration into the Government's formulated development strategy. Accordingly, the CPS is
shaped directly by Turkey's Ninth Development Plan and by the Government's Program and
aims at contributing to three main development pillars: (i)improved competitiveness and
employment, (ii)equitable human and social development, and (iii) efficient provision of high-
quality public services.
40.    The authorities expressed strong interest in DPLs to accompany and support Turkey's
ongoingreform agenda, primarily because of the Bank's comparative advantageinpolicy advice
and support linked to flexible budget financing. Under the new CPS, public sector reforms will
be supported through the PPDPL series, while a proposed series of Competitiveness and
Employment Development Policy Loan (CEDPL) would support the investment climate, the
financial sector, the labor market, innovation and technology. Similarly, the proposedDPLs in
the area ofenergy will support energy supply security.
41.    The new CPS envisages that the phasing of Bank financing and the mix of DPLs and
investment financing will be flexible. Thus, Bank financing may be front-loaded, back-loaded,
or evenly phased, and the share of DPLs may exceed or fall short o f the expected fifty percent
average in any one year and over the 4-year CPS period-depending                 on the economic
circumstances in Turkey and the substantive content and pace of implementationof the Turkish
authorities' economic reform and investment programs.            Recognizing the importance of
continuity and predictability, the Bank will nonetheless aim, working with the authorities, to
manage Bank financing ina way consistentwith a broadlyevendistribution of newcommitments
over the CPS period. The two mainreasons for flexibility inthe instrument mix and phasing of



                                                 10

Bank financing, reflecting the Turkish authorities' preference, are the intrinsic and persistent
uncertainties and volatility in global financial markets and the rapid evolution o f the Turkish
economy. Such flexibility in instrumentchoice i s also consistent with the implementation o f the
Bank Group's M I C Strateg~.~
42.     The scale of available Bank financing and its phasing over the CPS period will be
determined by the Bank's review and approval o f each new loan commitment. The Bank's
review will focus on the maintenance o f sound macroeconomic management, financial sector
stability, and progress in the three CPS development areas, namely (a) improved competitiveness
and employment opportunities, (b) equitable human and social development, and (c) the efficient
provision o f highquality public services.
43.      Specifically, the Bank will assess Turkey's macroeconomic management and financial
sector stability and performance inthe three CPS development areas by considering public policy
action triggering progress inthe following six reform areas:

    0   Continued good macroeconomicpolicies,through the implementation o f a satisfactory
        macroeconomic framework broadly in line with the scenario presented in the CPS
        document.

    0   Continued good financial sector policies, designedto enhance financial sector stability
        through improved efficiency o f the financial sector, including public sector banks.

    0   Improved investment climate and reduced informality through measures such as the
        enactment o f the new commercial code, further simplificatiodreform of the income tax
        system, and development o f a strategy for combating informality.

    0   Improved functioning of the labor market including through the enactment of
        legislation aimed at increasing labor market flexibility and participation, especially for
        women and youth, reducing non-wage labor costs, and increasing the protection for
        workers relative to protection o fjobs.

    0   Implementation of sustainable and more equitable social security through measures
        such as the enactment and initial implementation o f a revised Social Security and UHI
        Law that addresses the Constitutional Court decision while maintaining the twin
        objectives o f long-term fiscal sustainability and equitability o f the social security system,
        continuation o f targeted benefits to poor families, and adoption o f a new social assistance
        law.

    0   Improved effectiveness of public expenditures, through measures such as the
        enactment o f appropriate state aid legislation in conformity with EU directives, budget
        implementation consistent with the medium-term framework, continued implementation
        o f the PFMC Law and the adoption o f a new law on the Turkish Court o f Accounts
        (TCA).

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMFAND OTHER DONORS
44.      The IMF and World Bank teams have collaborated closely in Turkey, and standard
working arrangements broadly follow the guidelines for enhanced Bank-Fund collaboration.
This has includedparticipation o f Bank staff inmeetingswith government o fthe Fund's program
review missions, and IMF staff invited to key Bank review meetings and meetings with
government. The IMF has taken the lead inmacroeconomic stabilization and the World Bank in
social and structural areas, with close collaboration in structural areas that have a particular
impact on macroeconomic stability.
45.      Inthe areas o fthe government's program supported by PPDPL, collaborationbetweenthe
Bank and the IMF has focused on strengtheningPEM system while maintaining fiscal discipline.
The IMF has taken the lead in the short-term measures needed for the fiscal adjustment such as
incomes policy, urgent revenue and expenditure measures, and budget monitoring and reporting.
The Bank has taken the lead in assisting government on the medium-term PEM strategy,
rationalization o f the Public Investment Program (PIP), public procurement reform, accounting
reform, and public liability management. Public employment policy, medium-termtax strategy,
anti-corruption strategy and civil service reform are further areas o f Bank involvement.
46.      The ongoing EU accession process has generated increased demand for the Bank's
services in Turkey. Incollaboration with the European Commission (EC) the Bank completed in
March 2006 the first o f a series o f Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) focused on EU
accession and a second CEM was completed inApril 2008. The program i s fully consistent with
and supportive o f the Lisbon Agenda which envisions to make the EU one o f the most
competitive and productive regions o f the world.
47.     The Bank has coordinated closely with the EU its advice on public procurement and
follow up technical assistance to the Public Procurement Agency (PPA).          The social security
reforms supported under the PPDPL series are in conformity with the European Social Model,
and will help Turkey both stay on track interms o f Copenhagen criteria but also move forward in
terms o f meeting the Lisbon agenda.        The establishment o f Development Agencies (DAs),
supported under the PPDPL 2, will help establish the institutional infrastructure requiredfor the
use o f EU's structural funds.
48.     The Bank's assistance on public debt management issues has been oriented towards EU
practices and the Maastricht criteria.      The Bank is coordinating its dialogue on financial
management issues with the EU, and the law on PFMC i s consistent with EU standards on
internal controls.   The EU has provided support for additional institution-building initiatives
under the public sector reform program, including support for peer review and twinning
arrangements for the TCA and support for the Ministry o f Finance (MOF).
RELATIONSHIP OTHER BANKOPERATIONS
                 TO
49.     Turkey's public sector reform program since 2000 has included PEM reform, tax policy
and administration reform, public liability management and governance reform. Lendingsupport
was through the Economic Reform Loan (ERL) (2000) and the three PFPSALs PFPSAL I(July
                                                                                   -
2001), PFPSAL I1(April 2002) and PFPSAL I11(June 2004 and June 2006). PPDPL series have
beenthe next programmatic series supporting reforms inTurkey's public sector as a continuation
o f the public sector reform agenda envisaged under the PFPSAL program. The first PPDPL was

deliveredin June 2006. Financial sector reform components o f the PFPSAL program have been
integrated into the CEDPL series o f which the first one was deliveredinJune 2007.
50.     The PPDPL series have strong linkages with a number o f other Bank-financed investment
projects. The Health Transition Project (HTP) approved inJune 2004 supports a comprehensive
health sector reform program that will improve the cost-effectiveness o f the health care system so
that the introduction o f UHIcan become fiscally sustainable. Likewise, the Privatization Social
Support Project (PSSP) series (PSSP and PSSP 11) i s providing the necessary social support to
ensure the continued highly successful privatizationprogram.
LESSONSLEARNED
5 1.    The World Bank made its first loan to Turkey in 1954, shortly after the country became a
member. The Bank has been active in virtually all sectors and has conducted a great amount of
analytical and advisory services. Consequently, numerous lessons have been learned in this
relationship and the most relevant from the perspective o f this Loan are summarized in the
Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) for the period July 1, 1993 to June 30, 2004. The Bank's
2005 Review o f World Bank Conditionality constitutes another source o f lessons learned
relevant to DPLs to Turkey.
52.     Lessons learned have been reflected in the design o f the PPDPL program as follows.
First, in Turkey the Bank benefits from bundling its analytical work and policy dialogue with
lending to achieve effectiveness. The 1993-2004 CAE found that little formal economic and
sector analysis was carried out up to the late 1990s but that thereafter economic and sector
analysis has become a larger part o f the Bank's program which has increased program
effectiveness materially. The PPDPL program has been designed on the basis o f a substantial
amount o f analytical work.
53.     Turkey is able to borrow from financial markets at low spreads and maturities,
sometimes, longer than those offered by the Bank. In addition, Turkey has access to funding
from a variety o f other development partners, which in some cases are able to lend at lower
financial and compliance costs than the Bank. Thus, the Bank's ability to effectively engage with
the government on program design depends largely on the quality o f its analytical work and
policy dialogue capability-key  elements in supporting program ownership. In this regard, the
CAE also found that the policy dialogue has been more effective with the increased management
focus on Turkey that resultedfrom greater decentralization o f Bank decision-making to Ankara
and the increased role o f the Country Office in program monitoring and implementation. The
PPDPL program i s being managed from the Country Office with input from staff based in
headquarters, as required.
54.     The 2005 Review o f World Bank Conditionality indicates that disbursement conditions
should be few and focused on actions critical for achieving the results sought under a program.
The Bank's policy loans to Turkey have seen a dramatic decrease in the number o f conditions.
For example, the second tranche o f the ERL was disbursed in 2004-four          years after Board
approval. One reason for this long delay i s that this loan had about 40 disbursement conditions.
Since the approval o f the ERL, policy loans have been increasingly focused on critical actions.
PPDPL 2 has only eight prior actions.




                                                 13

55.     Country ownership is fundamental for the program supported by this Loan as evidenced
by the political difficulty entailed by some of the elements in the envisagedprogram of reforms.
This recognition calls for flexibility and for collaboration with key domestic reform leaders in
developing the analytical underpinning of the reform for their use in their own policy dialogue
with national constituencies.
ANALYTICALUNDERPINNINGS
56.     The World Bank has provided considerable analytical support to Turkey's public sector
reform program through four CEMs (2000,2003,2006, 2008), Country Procurement Assessment
Report (2001), Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA, 2001) and Public
Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR, 2001) and Municipal Sector Review (2004) and
Public Expenditure Review (PER, 2006). The Bank has been providing technical assistance in
developing the government's technical capacity to run pension reform option simulations for
several years. In addition, a report on costing UHI was provided in 2004. A Joint Poverty
Assessment Report was completed inAugust 2005. A labor market study was finalized in April
2006 and a new Programmatic CEM Series has been launched, of which the first CEM was
concluded in February 2006 and the second one in April 2008. A PER was concluded in
December2006.

                                V.     THE PROPOSEDPPDPL 2

RATIONALE FOR WORLD BANKSUPPORT OF THE PPDPLPROGRAM
57.     World Bank support to the implementation of the program with this Loan i s justified
because (a) the program supports a substantial amount of good public policies-which           are
expected to contribute to improving social outcomes, modernizing public expenditure
management systems, strengthening public governance andjustice system, ensuring provision of
high quality public services and reducing regional disparities-    and because (b) the authorities
have strong ownership of the program as evidenced by the fact that they implemented
successfully all the prior actions-some   of whichwere highly challenging.
58.     The Government's program puts great emphasis on improving the efficiency and quality
of public services. Improving the quality and management of public expenditures, strengthening
public sector governance, improving judicial services, putting into practice the e-government,
reducing regional disparities, improving local delivery of public services are among the key
priorities.
59.     Continuing improvements in the composition and quality of public spending will greatly
help Turkey meet its development challenges and foster sustained growth. Fiscal consolidation
so far has relied heavily on revenues. Future efforts on the expenditure side will be important to
increasethe sustainability of fiscal adjustment and helpsupport economic growth inparticular by
containing current expenditures so that sufficient fiscal room i s left for financing productive
public investments. Moreover, a strong public sector primary surplus will needto be maintained
inorder to acceleratethe reduction ofpublic debt inproportion to GDP and forestall pressures on
the external current account. To this end, reducing state aid and implementing the social security
reform will be important.




                                                 14

60.       Increased fiscal space could be sought possibly by reducing spending in functional areas
where it appears to be oversized in international comparison and by implementing reforms that
improve efficiency and help contain costs in areas where expenditure pressures are being felt-
such as health care and pensions. Horizontal reforms, focused on the careful formulation o f the
investment program, would also help contain pressures on investment spending across functional
areas.     The Government recognizes the importance o f ensuring appropriate allocations for
operation and maintenance (O&M) of public capital as accelerated decay o f capital goods may
unduly burdenthe investmentprogram inthe future. A framework conducive to a greater role o f
the private sector in the financing, development and operation of infrastructure should be
created-requiring      a predictable policy and regulatory environment, together with careful design
o f Government commitments to private operators to minimize the risk o f contingent liabilities.
61.      Addressing the unfinished agenda in Public Financial Management (PFM) reform
represents a major challenge.           Far-reaching PFM reforms have improved budget coverage,
formulation, execution, accounting, auditing, and procurement, providing a new legal framework
for modern public expenditure management and accountability. The main challenge ahead i s the
implementation o f the reform agenda throughout the entire general government. The key areas
that require further attention are: (i)enabling a fully functioning internal audit structure; (ii)
enactment o f the TCA legislation, and (iii)improving the financial management and control
structure o f the remaining Extra Budgetary Funds (EBF) and revolving funds.                       Effective
leadership and coordination among agencies would be required for the effective implementation
o f the overall P F Mreform agenda.
62.      Despite the recent improvements, public sector governance remains a key priority for
Turkey inthe mediumterm. The NinthDevelopment Plan o f the Government for the 2007-2013
period identified "increasing quality and effectiveness o f public services" as one o f the 5
development axes. Priorities under this axes include among others restructuring o f the public
administration, human resources management andjudicial reform. The public sector governance
and judicial reform agendas are o f crucial importance for a strong investment climate conducive
to growth and job creation, and thus for meeting Turkey's long-term development challenges.
Turkey would also benefit from a strong public administration that is more apt to implementthe
EUAcquis Communitaire. Similarly the justice sector will play a critical role in adapting to EU
requirements and standards. Improving public sector governance encompasses a broad agenda,
underpinning many o f the short-term and medium-term priorities in the Accession Partnership
with Turkey adopted by the EU Council in January 2006.4 Some key challenges, for example,
include (a) promoting judicial reform-to         ensure consistent interpretation o f legal provisions and
strengthenthe efficiency of procedures; and (b) ensuring effective, transparent, and participatory
local administration-a          key for improving the quality o f public services; for effective
implementation o f regional development policies and rural development and the absorption o f
EUpre-accession funds.
63.      Addressing regional differences is also part o f the Government's medium-term agenda.
Income disparity both across regions and provinces inTurkey i s considerable. Inorder to support

regional development and facilitate the use o f EU funds for this purpose, the Government has
begun to set up DAs. These would play a planning and coordination role, supporting
implementation o f regional plans and programs. As o f March 2008, only two DAs have been
established in regions o f Izmir and Adand Mersin but the government is planning to establish
DAs in all 26 Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) 2 regions.              Other
remaining challenges include: (i)designing and implementing a national strategy for regional
development, (ii) managing the EU funds for regional development, and (iii)   building capacity at
the DAs.
64.     Advancing decentralization will have a major impact on the efficiency and quality o f
public services at the local level. Local administrations account for only about 10 percent o f
government expenditures.       The Government has embarked on a gradual process of
decentralization. The authorities are aware o f the importance o f successful decentralization, o f
improvements in the technical capacity o f local administrations and in local accountability, and
o f the matching o f expenditure responsibilities and revenues. The targeting o f transfers to local
administrations i s also a key issue, given the wide disparities in tax bases among the local
administrations.
65.     On the basis o f the analysis summarized above, the Loan has been designed to support
policy interventions in key areas with the aim o f contributing to improving the country's social
protection system, upgrading financial controls and public expenditure management systems, and
improving the administration and governance o f the public sector.
66.     There i s clear evidence that the authorities are committed to the reform program
supported by the proposed Loan as evidenced by (a) the existence o f a well-designed medium
term government program encompassing all these important reform areas (Section 111and Annex
V) and by (b) the substantial progress achieved in outcomes. Therefore, the PPDPL 2 supports
the implementation of a credible program o f structural reforms with full government ownership,
a program that builds on Turkey's successful returnto economic stability and rapid GDP growth.

PROGRAMMATICFRAMEWORKOPERATION DESCRIPTION
                                  AND

67.     The PPDPL series is intended to support the government's medium-term program of
legal, institutional, and structural policy actions aimed at consolidating fiscal adjustment and
modernizing the institutions and procedures o f public sector management and service delivery.
The government has adopted a well defined medium term program that will be implemented
flexibly in order to react to unpredictable events as they unfold-includingy for instance, the
process o f EU-accession negotiations, political cycles, and global events.
68.     The EU accession process has become a driving force for Turkey's reform efforts over
the recent years. It has provided an anchor for the continuation and deepening of reforms, thus
fostering Turkey's growth potential and accelerating convergence to EU living standards. The
NinthDevelopment Plan of the government was prepared with the vision of, among others, full
harmonization with the EU's institutional and legal framework for member countries.         The
Government has prepared a six-year program o f economic, social, and institutional
harmonization with the EU Acquis Communitaire. The proposed PPDPL 2 i s aligned with the
new strategic objectives o f the government, supporting selectively key elements o f the
Government's Development Plan (see Annex V) and the process o f EUaccession.
69.     Bank support under the PPDPL program will follow a programmatic approach. This
approach provides flexibility for program implementation which allows adaptation in timing and
sequencing to the ongoing dynamic process o f EU accession negotiations. Priorities within the
overall public sector reform program may change as EUnegotiations advance.
70.     The operations under the PPDPL series support actions in four components, namely: (a)
maintaining the currently enabling macroeconomic framework; (b) reforming the country's social
protection system; (c) continuing the on-going process o f upgrading the financial controls and
expenditure management o f public resources; and (d) improving the administration and
governance of the public sector.
71.     The first PPDPL has already supported a number o f reforms to tackle this agenda.
Accordingly, the PPDPL 2 supports important second stage critical implementationachievements
since the first operation infour connected subjects within the government's program. All actions
and milestones supported by PPDPL 2 are included in Turkey's broader economic policy and
reform program (Section I11 and Annex V). PPDPL 2 was predicated on the enactment o f the
amended Social Security and UHI Law on May 8, 2008. The followings are the core policy
actions supported by the Loan. All o f them have beensuccessfully met.

    0   Implementation of the Law reforming the administrative dimensions of social
        security by unifying the existing three social security schemes (Law No. 5502) is on
        track. In particular, satisfactory implementationof an agreed action plan resulted
        in (a) consolidated electronic records of the previous social security institutions and
        use of integrated identity number system, (b) personnelpolicies for the new SSI and
        a core cadre of staff; (c) established financial management and claims adjustment
        systems, (d) uniquepositivedrug lists for all participantsin the new SSI.

    0   An expenditure tracking system for pharmaceuticals has been established and is
        operational.




                                                 18

    0   All secondary legislation required for the PFMC has been published and has
        becomeeffective.

    0   Strategy development units responsible for strategic planning, budgeting,
        accounting and internal control functions have become operational in all general
        governmentinstitutions.

    0   2006 financial statements of central government institutions and local
        administrationshave been prepared on an accrualbasis.

    a   A law for the establishment of Regional Courts of Appeal has been enacted and
        made effective,in order to ease the backlogof cases within the Court of Appeals.

    a   On-line connections among courts have been established through satisfactory
        implementationof the NationalJudicialNetworkProject(UYAP).

    0   At least two DAs have been established and are operational.
72.     Inaddition to the above core policy actions, the authorities have completed a substantial
number o f other important policy actions and milestones in the implementation o f the broader
reform program supported by PPDPL 2-as             presented in the program matrix in Annex 11.
Progress o f this magnitude bodes well for continued future implementation o f a comprehensive
mediumterm public sector reform program.
73.     What follows i s a brief description o f the structural constrains that the actions
implementedunderthe program seek to ameliorate or remove.
POLICYAREASSUPPORTEDBY THE LOAN
COMPONENT SUSTAINING ANENABLINGMACROECONOMIC
               I:                                                   FRAMEWORK
74.     Over the last few years, Turkey has been among the fastest growing economies in the
world. Inflation has fallen to single digits for the first time inthree decades, and macroeconomic
vulnerabilities have been significantly reduced. Elements in this performance include a tight
fiscal policy, a flexible exchange rate, and reforms in the public and financial sectors. On the
other hand, large exposure of foreigners in Turkish assets, substantial external financing needs,
comparatively short maturity o f the public debt, highgross external debt stock, and highroll-over
rates imply some vulnerability to exogenous shocks.
75.     The challenge for the authorities is to minimize the impact that the realization o f these
risks would have on growth, employment, and poverty-among            other key variables. Therefore,
the government and the Bank have agreed that maintaining a satisfactory macroeconomic
framework should be a condition for disbursingthe PPDPL 2.
76.     Inassessingwhether the macroeconomic framework is satisfactory, Bank staff have used
projections o f Turkey's medium-term macroeconomic outlook to assess the sustainability o f its
fiscal program, balance o f payments, and associated debt dynamics. These projections have been
made using a macroeconomic consistency model which focuses on (a) fiscal and debt
sustainability risks, (b) balance of payment vulnerabilities, (c) monetary and exchange rate risks,
and (d) financial sector risks.
77.     Bank staff has also taken into considerationthe views of the IMF and regards the status o f
the IMF stand-by program-in      place since May 2005-as      an additional element to conclude that


                                                  19

Turkey's macroeconomic situation is adequate and that government policies are likely to be
 sustainable over the mediumterm
COMPONENT 11: SOCIAL SECURITY AND SOCIAL ASSISTANCE               REFORM
 78.     Turkey had a fragmented social protection system in the past as three separate social
 security institutions provided services to workers, civil servants and self employed. Registration
with one of the three institution determined eligibility for pensions, health insurance, and
unemployment insurance. This fragmented structure with incompatible databases had facilitated
noncompliance which negatively affected the system's revenue as large numbers o f employers
and workers neither paid their pension contributions nor their health insurance premiums.
79.      In order to create an effective and modern social protection system, the Turkish
government has embarked on a comprehensive and challenging social security reform consisting
o f four main pillars since 2004. The first pillar aims at establishing a unique pension regime,
which involves long and short term insurance programs except health insurance. The second
pillar supports the establishment o f a UHI to finance a fair, preventive, treatment-oriented and
high quality health service for the whole population. The third pillar involves the unification of
the currently diversified social assistance and services. The fourth pillar aims at integrating the
three separate social security institutions under a single administration so as to provide social
protection services ina facilitating and accessible as well as effective manner to the citizens.
80.      The Bank has been providing support to the government efforts in reforming Turkey's
social protection system through its PPDPL program. The first PPDPL supported the unification
o f the three fragmented social security institutions under a single administration and introduction
o f a parametric pension reform together with UHI. Although the law reforming the pension
parameters and creating legislative base for UHIwas partly canceled by the Constitutional Court
in December 2006 (mostly for articles related to civil servants), the government has shown its
commitment to the broader social protection reform agenda in Turkey and moved forward with
implementation o f the administrative restructuring and certain parts o f UHI reform.           The
government also amended the Social Security and UHILaw inorder to address the Constitutional
Court ruling through enactment o f the Law No. 5754 on May 8, 2008. Full implementation o f
the law is scheduled for October 2008 in order to allow time for the issuance o f secondary
regulation required for the implementation. This Loan (PPDPL 2) acknowledges the progress
achieved since the first operation in areas where there was no legal challenge and the government
has made a substantial advancement.

Administrative Dimensions of the Social Security System

81.      One o f the key goals o f the social protection reforms inTurkey was to tackle the previous
fragmentation o f the social security system.         Apart from inherent and historic parametric
imbalances in the pension system (low retirement age and generous benefit calculations), the
fragmentation o f the system itself had posed significant structural problems: different pension
parameters (accrual rate, retirement age, valorization, indexation etc) existed in the previously
three existing institutions (Social Security Institution for Workers in the Old System (SSK),
Social Security Institution for Civil Servants in the Old System (Emekli Sandigi) and Social
Security Institution for Self-Employed and Farmers inthe Old System (Bag-Kur)), compromising
horizontal equity. Incompatible databases meant that transfers of social security records o f the


                                                   20

insuredwere significantly hampered ifnot impossible. Further, the fragmentation o f the system
itself was responsible for low collection rates, limited access to pension benefits, as well as -
especially for health insurance coverage - discretionary granting o f services to formally not
eligible beneficiaries.
82.     Unifyingsocial security regimesby mergingthe previously existing institutions hadto go
hand in hand with a wide-reaching and complicated administrative reform. In many respects,
such administrative reforms are the necessary condition for the effective implementation o f the
parametric pension reforms as well as the implementation o f the introduction of the UHIreform.
The agenda o f such administrative reform was significant and included inter alia,
           establishment o f legal basis for the merging o f the previously existing three social
           security institutions;
           integration o f staff working for the previously existing social security institutions.
           Creation o f a unified database for the pension system, integrating the previously non-
           compatible technology platforms into a new system. Such integration was to start
           with the conversion to new citizen identification numbers of all individual records of
           active contributors, passive members (beneficiaries) but then also all records of past
           contributors that had an interrupted contribution record, eliminating double entries
           and counting;
           establishment o f a unified database for the UHI, including the merging o f the
           beneficiary (and dependent) databases and then establishing a financial management
           and claims adjustment system that would be capable o f linking provider claims for the
           actual provision o f services for beneficiaries to the insurance record o f beneficiaries
           inthe UHI;

        0  ultimately, the establishment o f a single pension fund (integrating collection o f
           pension contributions, health premiums and pension payments) as well as the
           establishment o f a UHI Fund (managing other financial flows in the health sector,
           including premiums paid by the budget on behalf o f the poor and health expenditures
           o f civil servants).
83.     The first PPDPL supported the law reforming the administrative dimension o f social
security by unifying previously existed three social security institutions (Law No. 5502 dated
May 2006). Given the tremendous challenge o f mergingthe three institutions so as to create an
effective modern single institution, the authorities and the Bank have agreed that the
implementation o f the above law would be supported under the second operation with a clear
action plan among other things.
84.     Despite the difficulties created by the cancellation of some parts o f parametric pension
and UHIreform by the Constitutional Court in December 2006, the government did press ahead,
and made major advance, regarding important parts o f the administrative reform agenda. First,
effective January 1, 2007, the previously existing three social security institutions were replaced
by the Turkish Social Security Institution (SSI) as had been established by Law No. 5502 from
May 16'h, 2006.




                                                 21

85.      Second, significant progress has been achieved in effective personnel integration: around
10,300 staff, representing about 40 percent o f total staff o f the previously existing institutions has
already been fully integrated into SSI, the large majority at the provincial level. Additionally, a
unified staff policy i s beingapplied uniformly to all current staff o f SSI.
86.      Third, advances toward the establishment of a unified database have also been
remarkable. For example, the former SSK pension insurance institution for workers transferred
30 million individual records to SSI and o f these, 14.5 million have been reclassified with a
unique T.R. identification number, including all new and active members.                    All citizen
identification numbers o f current beneficiaries (retirees) are similarly complete. The remaining
15.5 million records from SSK needto be examined one-by-one given that these are either not in
electronic environment or not active.
87.      Finally, major progress i s witnessed also through today's functioning o f the medical
messenger (MEDULA) system which links the Social Security Institute's information system to
health providers and effectively collects data on health service utilization o f insuredbeneficiaries
and provides for electronic payments to the providers. System development was started in the
last quarter o f 2005 and the system now provides for (i)service provider as well as beneficiary
identification and verification; (ii)transfer, prescription and investigation request notification;
(iii)payment processing; and (iv) invoicing. Today, MEDULA is fully operational, having
linked 2882 public and certified private hospitals. Medical examinations, tests, and treatments
are recorded on an individual basis in all contracted private health institutions, university and
public hospitals.
88.      The current operation (PPDPL 2) supports the significant advance made on the
administrative reform agenda as outlined above.         Specifically, Government implemented an
agreed action plan on administrative reform in a satisfactory way which included (i)making
significant progress towards consolidating electronic records o f the previous social security
institutions as witnessed by the above-mentioned updating and conversion o f 14.5 million
pension fund records o f SSK; (ii)  established personnel policies as well as core cadre o f staff o f
the new SSI; (iii)fully established the financial management and claims adjustment system
(MEDULA); and(iv) harmonized a unique positive druglist for all participants inthe new SSI.

ParametricPension Reform

89.     The amended pension reform as enacted on May 8, 2008 is projected to result in
substantial fiscal savings in the long run, and to help move the Turkish pension system toward
international parameters, as shown in Figure 7. The elements o f the reform are detailed in Table
3. The key parameters are discussed below.
90.     The retirement age in Turkey will reach current international norms of 65 for both men
and women under the amended Law. However, the Law provides for a slow transition to the new
retirement ages, with the retirement age o f 65 not being fully reached until 2070. Nevertheless,
moving to age 65 even inthe future i s a major improvement over the current final retirement ages
o f 60 for menand 58 for women.
91.     The minor increase in contribution period is not a significant factor assuming no change
in behavioral assumptions.      The rising retirement age will automatically lead to increased



                                                 22

contribution periods, making this minimum period a non-issue unless workers choose to
contribute only the minimumyears requiredfor a pension and evade pension contribution inprior
years.    The projections presented assume no change in workers' behaviors with respect to
contribution.
92.      The benefit accrual rate which has beentraditionally high inTurkey is now beingreduced
closer to international fiscally sustainable norms which are close to 1.5 percent o f benefit per
year of contribution. The accrual rates for civil servants are being reduced from 3 percent per
year to 2 percent per year for new entrants and for private sector workers from approximately
2.75 percent to 2 percent per year for new entrants.                  While the new accrual rates remain
somewhat above the international standards, taken together with the valorization parameters for
past earnings, discussed below, the overall benefit ratio comes closer to international norms.
93.      The averaging period for wages usedinpension calculation is being gradually introduced
to lifetime career average wages for farmers and civil servants, which i s in line with international
best practice. The averaging period for private sector employees and the self-employed was
already beingincreased to lifetime average.
94.      The revaluation o f past earnings (valorization), which had been set at growth o f nominal
GDP for private sector employees and the self-employed, has now beenreduced to inflation plus
30 percent o f real GDP growth. As nominal GDP growth outpaced wage growth by considerable
margins, valorization was very high in the past by international standards and contributed
substantially to the growing deficit in the social security system. The new, lower revaluation
parameter together with the benefit accrual rate brings the overall benefit ratio closer to the
international standards.        The new revaluation parameter will also apply to farmers whose
pensions were previously based on weighted average o f premium steps, and to new civil
servants' salary. The original version o f Law No. 55 10 had linkedrevaluation o f past pensions to
50 percent o f average wage growth and 50 percent o f inflation, but had been struck down by the
Constitutional Court on the grounds that a reliable wage series did not exist in Turkey and that
some part o f GDP growth should be included in the revaluation. The provisions in Law No.
5754 seek to accommodate the Constitutional Court's concern inthis regard.
95.      The indexation of pensions post-retirement is also moving from being linked to growth in
civil servant wages to growth in the price index for new civil servants and farmers. Previously,
private sector workers and the self-employed were already indexed by law to inflation so this
does not represent a change for them.

96.       The Constitutional Court also objected to the treatment of civil servants in the original
version of Law No. 5510. The amended Law No. 5510 seeks to address these concerns by
grandfathering the current civil servants and applying the unifiedprovisions only to new entrants
to civil service.

97.      Fiscal savings from the new social security and UHI law as amended by Law No. 5754,
compared with the status quo, will be large if the law is implementedin full over the long run-
and even the fiscal savings from the reform of the system for the private sector and self-
employed alone will be large. Figure 7 shows the substantial cost savings. The savings are
primarily attributable to the change in revaluation of past earnings in the short run and to the
increased retirement age and unified parameters for civil servants in the long run. Accordingly,
the reform generates increasingly higher fiscal savings relative to GDP, from an initial 0.2
percent of GDP culminating to 6.3 percent of GDP in the long run. These large fiscal savings
reduce the implicit pension deficit by more than half in the long term, compared with the status



  The implicit pension debt is the sum of the present value of all expected future benefit payments to current

Universal Health Insurance

98.      The UHI reform being implemented in Turkey is a fundamental structural reform,
matched in importance and size by few other countries in the world. Traditionally, and in line
with the structure of the social security system, health insurance coverage in Turkey was linked
to formal sector workers (and their dependents) being members of separate insurance funds,
leaving both a fragmented and inefficient system as well as significant under-coverage of the
population not linked to the formal labor market. Separately, the Ministry of Health (MOH)
provided services, mainly to the uncovered population through its own network of public
providers. The introduction of the "Green Card" system in 1992 -with an aim to providing
access to a basic health insurance for the poor until Turkey implementedUHI - helped close the
coverage gap substantially but not completely. The health services delivery system was also
fragmented with purchasers such as SSK managing their own hospitals, MOH managing their



prorated for the percentage of their lifetime contributionsthey have already made. In simple terms, if the pension
system were to stop today, the implicit pension debt is what the government owes all participants, contributorsand
beneficiaries. The implicit pension debt does not include future contributions as revenue because in a pension
system each future contributioncarries a new future liability.

own hospitals and primary care clinics complemented by University hospitals and private
providers.
99.      The public policy objectives behindthe introduction o f UHIinclude improving access to
quality health services by the poor, improving the efficiency and quality o f the health system and
putting on a normal footing the somewhat chaotic access to health insurance where large
numbers o f ineligible (non-contributing) individuals obtain services -regardless of their income
levels. The key elements o f UHI include: (a) mandatory participation with contributions based
on level o f income; (b) coverage o f poor citizens by the government through premiumpayments
on behalf of the poor; (c) cost-effective management o f the system based on improved risk
pooling, an enhanced benefits package and the introduction o f strengthened provider payment
systems that reward providers for efficiency and quality.
 100.    The UHI reform integrates the entire health financing system (the separate social
insurances and the Green Card system) into one universal insurance scheme under the SSI. With
this integration, SSI becomes the single purchaser inthe system responsible for negotiating and
signing contracts with public and private providers to deliver a pre-defined, harmonized health
care package for all citizens.
101.     The government has identifieda number o f key policy measures requiredfor an effective
and efficient UHI.These include:
            Facilitation o f access to healthcare services, with primary health providing the
            foundation o f the health care system and compliance with the referral chain;

         0  Competitive procurement o f services and goods from public or private sector,

         0 Establishment o f fast and effective functioning o f a reimbursement mechanism with
           the helpo fan electronic provisioning system.

         0 Provision o f quality, fast, clean, and appropriate healthcare services, which improves
           quality o f health and lives o f individuals
102.    For the aforementioned        measures to be achieved, the Government's              Health
Transformation Program (HTP) must be successfully implemented. Key reforms under HTP
include: (i), as the planner and the auditor, (ii)
              MOH                                         widespread, easily accessible and patient
friendly health services, which includes strengtheningprimary health care, family medicine and
establishing an efficient referral system, (iii)availability o f motivated health personnel with
adequate information and skills, (vi) enhanced quality o f care in health facilities, (vii)
institutional restructuring to support rational management o f pharmaceuticals and medical
devices.
103.    The objective o f the UHIreform that the proposed loan supports is the implementation of
an effective and fiscally sustainable UHI system. Specifically, the program supported by the
proposed loan includes: (i) creation o f an enabling legal environment for UHI, (ii)capacity
                             the
building measures that will assist SSI to carry out health financing functions (resource
mobilization, risk pooling and purchasing),           (iii)policy measures aimed at effective
implementation o f UHI (MOH restructuring, establishment o f appropriate pharmaceutical and
medical devices regulation, regulationo f private provision).




                                                   27

104.     The first PPDPL (2006) supported the creation o fthe legal basis for introducing a fiscally
sustainable UHI. Although, the Constitutional Court did not object to introduction o f UHI, the
cancellation of the articles related to civil servants by the Court led to a postponement o f the
implementation o f the whole legislation. Nonetheless, the govement's health reform program
continued. Health insurance coverage under the formal health insurance system (now integrated
under the SSI) has steadily risen from 35.5 million in 2004 to 44.5 million in 2007. Similarly,
the Green Card system - providing health insurance access to the poor - has expanded from 7
million to 9.3 million over the same time frame. Taking into account that about 7 million civil
servants and their dependents are currently covered, the actual coverage gap in Turkey today i s
estimated to be around 10 million individuals. Under UHI, this group would be formally
enrolled. Health benefits across the different (formal) health insurance schemes are largely
synchronized (2007 health budget law or the Health ImplementationRegulation (SUT)), and UHI
implementation will merely expand this benefitspackage to the remaining citizens who join UHI.
105.     Nonetheless, health expenditures have continued to rise rapidly over the past years.
Consolidated real health expenditures increased by 18.7 percent between 2004 and 2007. The
increase in health expenditures i s essentially explained by: (i)expanded access to outpatient
health services in the absence o f a strengthened primary health care system, which means most
primary care visits occur in a hospital setting (ii)absence o f a referral system, (iii)lack o f
demand side controls that would constraint consumers, (iv) a fee for service payment system for
inpatient and outpatient services without any constraints on volume.
106.     An actuarial analysis of UHI indicates the following:6 (i) health expenditures as a
                                                                               total
percentage o f GDP will increase from the current level o f 5.7 percent (baseline before
implementation o f UHI) to 6 percent by 2010. This increase reflects coverage expansion under
UHIas well as expansion of the SSI benefits package (latest changes under SUT in July 2007
which allows SSI insurees access to University and private hospitals without a referral) to those
currently under Green Card as well as new enrollees, (ii)by 2033, without cost management
reforms, total health expenditures as a percent o f GDP would increase to 9 percent o f which 7
percent would be public, (iii)under the cost management scenario, total health expenditures
would still grow but more moderately (6.7 percent o f GDP) (See Figure 8 for implications for
public expenditures).
107.     This analysis emphasizes the importance of implementing cost management measures
geared to effectively control the growth in health expenditures on both public and private
providers' side, This will involve strengthening the strategic purchasing function of SSI and
effectively implementingthe price setting and regulation instruments. Also, on the revenue side,
improved collection will contribute to fiscal sustainability. Important steps have already been
taken in this direction through the initial implementation o f a fixed price system for outpatient
procedures-though       this has recently beensuspended by the Council of State rulingwhich is yet
to be finalized-,     capitation-based payment system for family doctors, global budget with M O H

based on diagnosis). Full scale implementation o f these payment reforms i s critical for effective
cost management inthe Turkish health sector.
108.      The program supported by the proposed loan builds and expands on the policy actions
that had been supported under the first operation, as the government has continued to move
swiftly on the implementation and preparation o f the UHIreform. These actions can be grouped
infollowing areas, all supported byPPDPL 2.
109.    StructuralMeasures. This loan supports three structural measures that Government has
implemented: first, the creation o f
a unique positive drug list defining    Figure 8: Projected Growth in Public Expenditures on Health as
                                                                     a percent of GDP
eligible    and      cost   effective
pharmaceuticals that are covered             8.0 l------
for reimbursement under the UHI.
Second,    the Government        has
established and implemented a
fixed price for some groups o f
outpatients and inpatients services              i   .............

for public, university and private               &
hospitals.     However, this has
recently been suspended by the
Council o f State ruling which i s
yet   to   be     finalized.    The          0.0
Government has also implemented                                2008              2010            2033

a co-payment system for outpatient services, (ii)         negotiate an annual global budget with M O H
and university hospitals, thereby effectively capping expenditures for these two groups o f
hospitals, and (iii)implement a ceiling on prices charged by private hospitals where the
difference betweenthe price charged and the amount paid by SSI i s paid by the patient. Under the
current implementation, there is no such ceiling.
110.    System Integration and Development. System integration has advanced significantly.
First, and as pointed out above, MEDULA system now links the Social Security Institute's
information system to health providers and effectively collects data on health service utilization
o f insured beneficiaries and provides for electronic payments to the providers. As o f September
2007, all providers with a contract with SSI are required to submit claims using this system.
Second, the administration has established an expenditure tracking system for pharmaceuticals.
This system, a sine qua non for the effective management of expenditures for pharmaceuticals.
111.    These two system developmentshave critical importance for the implementation o f UHI
and have effectively established a fast and efficiently functioning reimbursement mechanism
based on contemporary control systems so as to prevent abuse o f national resources. Considering
the fact that the increase inhealth expendituresover the past years is almost entirely explained by
the increase inthe quantity o f numbero fmedical services and number o fprescriptions for drugs,
PPDPL 2 recognizes the importance of establishing an effective reimbursement and control


                                                     29

mechanism.      In this regard, PPDPL 2 supports the establishment o f MEDULA and the
expenditure tracking system for pharmaceuticals as core disbursement actions. Moreover, a
system such as MEDULA is critical for the future implementation by SSI o f sophisticated
hospital and outpatient provider payment mechanisms including pay-for-performance schemes
that can ensure that providers are meetingSSI stipulated goals o f patient access and quality.
112.    The MEDULA and the expenditure tracking system for pharmaceuticals also gather a
large number o f statistical data -paving        the road for developing an efficient management
support system which will be essential when the UHI is fully introduced. In this context, one
important next step will be to establish the link betweenthe pharmaceutical tracking system and
the MEDULA system so as to match the information on beneficiary, provider, diagnosis and
pharmaceutical use all over Turkey.
113.    Preparation for full implementation of the UHI and PPDPL 2. Several PPDPL 2
actions support the full implementation o f the UHI System. First, with the passage o f the Social
Security and UHI Law, SSI now has the legal mandate to develop the testing mechanism to
determine the poor population whose premium payments will be covered by Treasury. SSI has
two years to develop and implement a new targeting methodology. This will include recertifying
current GreenCard holders. As fiscal analysis shows, the planned expansion o f UHIto the entire
population will lead to additional significant costs o f coverage for SSI as Treasury premium
payments will fall significantly short o f additional expected health expenditures. This re-
emphasizes the importance o f containing future rapid increases in health expenditures as
mentioned above. Further, cut-off income levels currently established inthe Law will need to be
carefully reviewed regarding their impact on horizontal equity as well on the labor market (that
the levels set for exemptions do not provide incentives for informal employment).
114.   Inconclusion, the current operation (PPDPL 2) supports the significant progress made on
the UHI reform agenda as outlined above.             Specifically, the government (a) established an
expenditure tracking system for pharmaceuticals and (b) adopted tight global budget caps for
state hospitals on a quarterly basis.

115.    In the 1 9 9 0 ~leading up to the 2001 crisis, a fragmented budget and ineffective fiscal
                          ~
accountability mechanisms in Turkey's public sector contributed to large fiscal imbalances.
Fiscal policy was not within the control o f policy makers since a fragmented budget made both
maintenance o f fiscal discipline and management o f fiscal risks difficult. Multiple layers of
inspections and internal controls were ineffective but provided incentives for agencies to
establish off-budget flows to evade controls, further fragmenting the budget. Extensive off-
budget activities made it difficult to estimate, and therefore manage, the full extent o f
government finance and e~penditure.~




 Underlying public sector structural and management issues were analyzed in the 2000 and 2003 CEMs and the
2001 PEIR.

116.     Past pre-crisis periods (1994, 1999 and 2001) were characterized by large public sector
borrowing requirements, due to sharp increase in public wages, widening o f social security
deficits and transfer expenditures, including transfers to state banks.'
117.     State banks kept accumulating so-called `duty losses' incurred as they were directed to
fund government programs and to provide subsidized lendingto certain borrowers. With limited
public information about the extent o f these duty losses, and the widespread perception that they
constituted a contingent government liability, the sustainability o f public debt came into
question. Large off-budget expenditures o f so-called EBF added to these concerns about the
sustainability o f public debt.
118.     Moreover, until 2001 PFM in Turkey was dominated by an outdated legal framework
(Public Accounting Law dated 1927). A multitudeo f extra-budgetary funds and revolving funds
seriously jeopardized budget discipline, a plethora o f control and inspection agencies, focused on
compliance rather than ensuring the effectiveness o f management and control systems. The
supreme audit institution (TCA) was limited by its restricted mandate. General government
institutions lacked uniform accounting and reporting standards and a chart o f accounts that could
be readily consolidated. Accounting was cash-based, PFM systems were not able to capture
expenditurearrears nor government assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities.
119.     The 2001 crisis provided the impetus for policy-makers to address economic, social and
structural issues -including      PFM-       ina comprehensive manner. Inresponse to the 2001 crisis,
Turkey adopted a newmedium-termmacro-economic program and launched a renewedstructural
reform program inDecember 2001.9 The renewed program incorporateda three-pronged strategy
to achieve macroeconomic stability supported by improved social cohesion: (a) macroeconomic
policies to restore fiscal stability and growth, and aggressively support disinflation process; (b)
structural policies and institutional reforms to address financial sector and weaknesses in the
P F M system; and (c) enhanced social dialogue with increased emphasis on protecting the most
vulnerable groups. Accordingly, public sector reform since 2001 has focused on achieving the
significant fiscal adjustment required to underpin macroeconomic                             stabilization, while
simultaneously addressing underlying structural/institutional weaknesses.                        There has been
significant progresson both fronts.
120.     Fiscal adjustment in Turkey had two initial objectives.                     The first was to generate
sufficient primary surplus to support a credible macroeconomic framework that would improve
financial market confidence, facilitate debt reduction, and reduce inflation and interest rates. The
second was to undertake structural/institutional reforms needed to address the underlying
weaknesses in PFM that have contributed to the boom-bust cycles that have been a persistent
feature o f the Turkish economy for some years.
121.     The enactment of the PFMC Law in 2003 has provided a new legal framework for
modern public expenditure management and accountability. The underlying objectives o f
the new PFMC Law are to improve the quality of the public service delivery, enhance the
functioning o f the government and increase accountability and transparency in the public sector.
The Law has introduced strategic management concept through (i)linking plans and policies
'Transfer to state bankswas either in the form of capital injection or inthe form of duty losses.

with the budgets; (ii)initiating institutional strategic plans and performance budgets; and (iii)
introducing medium term fiscal framework in the budgeting process.                    Moreover, the Law
strengthens the link between responsibilities o f the officials and politicians and their
accountability to the public. It also improves the public expenditure and financial management
processes in line with international practices.          In order to support these new management
concepts, a number of systemic reforms have been implemented simultaneously, including a
Government Financial Statistics (GFS) compliant budget classification, an online budget
management information system, an online networked accounting system for the central
government, and a tax management system.
122.   PFM and accountability reform program o f the Government has been one o f the policy
areas supported by the Bank since 2001 first with the PFPSAL and then PPDPL series." Reforms
inthis area aimed at both achieving a sustainable fiscal adjustment as well as tackling the lack of
budgetary transparency which was as an ultimate source o f the crisis. The reform program,

    a expanded the coverage ofthe budgetto the entire central government institutions, and
       adopted international standards-IMF's          GFS classification-   o f budget classification that
       enabled economic, functional, and institutional breakdown for the entire general
       government;

       ledto improved fiscal discipline;

124.    The Bank has been providing support to the public expenditure reform agenda of the
Government. The PPDPL program supports selected key policy actions within the government
program with an aim to contributing to the attainment o f the following outcomes by the
Government:

        0  Improved fiscal discipline, better prioritization o f expenditures through strategic
           allocation of public resources, increased linkage between policy-planning and
           budgetingwith a mediumterm approach.

        0  Strengthened Public Financial Control and Audit functions, more transparent and
           betterperforming government sector:
                     o GFS       consistent   budget classification,     accrual-based financial

                     o Disclosure and reportingo ftax expenditures,
125.    PPDPL 2 recognizes the achievements accomplished by the authorities in implementing
the PFM reforms since the first operation. Accordingly, the policy matrix for the loan includes
three core disbursement actions and several milestones related to implementation o f the PFM
reforms. All the milestones and core disbursement actions have been met. In this context, the
following achievements indicate the progress made in public expenditure and financial
management reforms since the approval o f the first PPDPL.
126.    Implementation of the PFMC Law and secondary legislation. After the enactment o f
PFMC Law, completion o f the secondary legislation was one o f the main requirements for the
full implementation of the Law. The government has issued all the requiredsecondary legislation
for the implementation o fthe PFMC Law. Inthis regard, total o f 47 secondary legislations inthe
form o f regulation and communique have been issued and become effective. Among these


                                                33

secondary legislations, the critical ones are: (i) and procedures of strategic planning in the
                                                   rules

and working principles of the strategy development units (vi) rules and working principles of

127.    The third medium-term fiscal plan covering 2008-2010, prepared by the government in
June 2007 based on the macro policies, targets and sectoral policies and priorities laid out inthe
mediumterm macro plan. After preparation and implementation of the 2007 budget, all general
government institutions have prepared their 2008 budget according to the GFS budget
classification. This common budget classification sets the ground for consolidating general
government revenues and expendituresdata which was missing inthe Turkish system inthe past.
128.    Since 2006, while submitting central government budget draft to the Parliament, the
Government included aggregate revenue and expenditure projections on the revolving funds,
extra-budgetary funds, social security institutions, and local administration to inform the
Parliament about the entire general government sector including off-budget activities.        The
General Directorate of Public Accounts (GDPA) has begun collecting monthly financial statistics
inrespect of revolvingfunds. Quarterly statistics is postedMOF websiteregularly.
129.    Administrative restructuringunder the PFMC Law. As the mainresponsible agency
for the implementation of the PFMC Law, the MOF carried out an internal administrative
restructuring in order to manage and monitor implementation. MOF has completed its
restructuring in line with the new roles introduced by the PFMC Law. Four new departments
have been established to serve as central harmonization unit, namely the Financial Management,
Internal Control, Internal Audit, and Training and Quality Departments. A total of 27 personnel
have beenappointed inthese departments.
130.    Strategy development units have been established and fully operational in all
general government institutions.These units are essential for the successful implementation of
the PFMC Law since they are responsible for the financial management and control functions.
More specifically, these units cover strategic planning, performance based budget preparation
and its execution, internal control, and accounting and reporting. Strategy development units
have been newly created at the central government institutions, while existing structures have
beenassignedthe role for strategy development units at the local administrations level.
131.    The appointment o f around 600 financial services experts was completed to the strategy
development units out of 1,200 positions for the central government. After the completion of
orientation training, the MOF is planning to provide two weeks training during the period of
June-September2008,
132.    Internal Audit Capacity.As the head of administrations take more responsibility in line
with the increase in their flexibilities, establishing a well functioning internal audit structure
becomes crucial. Internal audit units which reports directly to the head of the administration are
critical for the system to provide assurance on the internal control systems and realization of
managerial responsibility principle. Developing internal audit capacity i s still an ongoing
process. As of January 2008, 677 internal auditors have been appointed in the general
government institutions. The training for 374 internal auditors for 90 days has been completed
and they have been certified. The second group training was initiated in January 2008 and i s


                                                   34

expected to be finalized by end May 2008. With the completion of this training, total number o f
661 internal auditors will be certified.
133.    Strategic Planning in Public Institutions. In line with the strategic management
concept of the PFMC Law, institutional strategic planning has been initiated in the public
administrations to allocate the pubic resources according to government policy priorities. The
Government completed the strategic planning piloting in the eight institutions, and carried out a
strategic management survey covering 95 public administrations to evaluate institutional and
technical capacity of the administrations for undertaking strategic planning. Based on the
outcomes of these studies, the Government decided to go ahead with a phased out approach in
expanding the strategic planning in the central government administration. The time frame for
this expansion has beendetermined as end-2006- beginning of 2009. As o f February 2008, total
of 108 central government institutions prepared their strategic plans in line with the announced
timetable. For the local administrations, as determined by the Municipality Law, 149 local
administrations out of 269 with more than 50,000 populations prepared their strategic plans.
Although, SOEs are not covered under the PFMC Law, the Government issued a Council o f
Ministers' decision that introduced strategic planning for the SOEs also. According to this
regulation, the SOEs are requiredto complete their strategic plans which cover 2009-2013 period
byJuly 2008.
134.    Performance based budgeting is moving ahead in line with the strategic planning time
table for the central government institutions. So far 26 central government institutions prepared
performance based budgets, out o f 44 requiredto do so according to the announced timetable.
135.    Accrual Basis Financial Statements. The importance o f accrual accounting for
macroeconomic policy arises from the fact that it measures assets and liabilities that are relevant
to the overall stance o f fiscal policy and fiscal sustainability, but which are not measured by cash
accounting. Analyzing the fill cost o f the public service provision i s important when considering
alternative service delivery options including outsourcing. Additionally, accrual accounting
allows a fill assessment of the government's financial position by showing all resources and
obligations.
136.    Accrual accounting started for the central government institutions - general budget,
special budget and regulatory and supervisory agencies in 2006. After the issuance o f detailed
accounting plans for local administrations which are consistent with the general government
accounting regulation, M O F started collecting the local administrations financial data on an
accrual basis consistent with the rest o f the General Government. Although the local
administrations are not part o f the say2000i accounting system, the M O F incorporated
electronically quarterly trial balance o f the local administration into the say 2000i accounting
system. Through this development, the consolidated local administrations balance sheet was
generated by the M O F on an accrual basis for 2006.
137.    Once the social security institutions data are collected in the same format, the MOF will
be able to generate consolidated general government financial statements on an accrual basis.
Because o f the institutional restructuringo f the SSI - merger o f the three institutions under one
umbrella-the   social security institutions were not able to produce their accrual based financial
statements.




                                                   35

138.    Tax expenditures. Tax expenditures which are in the form of revenue forgone and do
not appear explicitly as spending, can play important role in implementing government policy
priorities. Lack of scrutiny or ability to monitor tax expenditures makes it difficult to evaluate the
cost, efficiency and equity impact of these expenditures. The MOF included a list of tax
expenditures and the related estimate amounts arising from the income tax, corporate tax, value
added tax, special consumption tax, and other laws for the 2008-2010 period as an attachment to
the budget. The total tax expenditure for 2008 was estimated as YTL 12.4 billion. Moreover, a
more detailed study on tax expenditures completing the list has beenpublished on the web page
of MOF. This report defines 87 articles or sub-articles as tax expenditures and provides an
estimate tax expenditures amount of YTL 11.9 billion for 2007.
139.    Other public expenditure and financial management reforms. The government is
committed to key public expenditure and financial management reforms, which are also part of
the EU accession negotiations. Such reforms include, for instance, passage of a satisfactory
Turkish Courts of Accounts (TCA) Law and State Aid Law. The EU Commission has now taken
center stage in these reforms. Although the EU accession negotiations have created a powerful
external anchor for the reforms, it, at the same time, made the modality and timing of these
legislations subject to the government's own policy reform schedule and status of negotiations
with the EU. For instance, given that the enactment of the draft TCA Law has beenmade by the
EU Commission a closing benchmark for the Financial Control Chapter under the EU accession
negotiations, it is highly likely that a satisfactory law will be enacted. However, its timing is
uncertain. Similarly, a new draft law on state aid has been submitted to the Prime Minister's
office but timing of the parliamentary approval is yet to be determined. Nonetheless, the
government expressed its interest in enacting the draft state aid law to comply with the EU
Acquis Communitaire and asked for Bank support under the PPDPL program.
140.    Recognizing the importance of flexibility in program design, and the implications of the
dynamic process of EU accession negotiations for public sector reform, PPDPL 3 i s designed to
support a broadened measure to advance public expenditure and financial management reforms
through one or more actions such as adoption of a satisfactory TCA Law or a satisfactory state
aid law consistent with the Government's program for EUharmonization.
141.    Public Investment:Despite significant success inrationalization of the PIP in the recent
years, ensuring sufficient resources for high quality public investment projects remains a key
challenge. While existing infrastructure needs are sizeable, expenditure pressures in investment
will only rise further as alignment with the EU accelerates. The Government has recognized
repeatedly the expected expenditure pressure on the PIP in its Annual Programs. The 2008
program reiterates two major problems in the PIP; first, the lack of adequate resource allocation
to current investment needs, and second inefficiencies inusing these allocations.
142.    Going forward, it i s important to increase the stock of public capital with a strategic view.
However, it is also important to secure appropriate allocations for O&M of the existing capital
stock. This is an important requirement not only for improving the quality of services, but also
for restricting the cost of the projects. The main issues related with O&M expenditures in
Turkey canbe cited as follows:

        0   Lack of a common framework for definitions and methodology.




                                                  36

             Insufficient allocations for O&M needs-     accelerating the decay of capital goods and
             unduly burdeningthe investment program inthe future.
143.     In its investment program guidelines for 2008-2010, the State Planning Organization
(SPO) envisages (a) prioritization of infrastructure investments that would contribute to meeting
social needs and promoting productive activities and (b) enhancing the effectiveness,
productivity and timeliness of public investments through continued rationalization efforts. The
2008 investment program i s consistent with the framework provided by the NinthDevelopment
Plan and the priorities expressed in four of the development axes (excluding employment) are
reflected inthe public investment allocations and related regulations.
144.     The authorities have increased emphasis on public asset management as evidenced by the
prioritization of O&M expenditures in the 2008 Annual Program. In June 2007, the Bank and
SPO organized a joint workshop on public operations and maintenance expenditures. The
workshop facilitated extensive discussions by the participants from key public institutions on
issues regarding the current state of the operations and maintenance expenditures, actual needs,
problems and solution proposals. In advance of the workshop, SPO requested from all public
institutions for the first time the stock of public capital and current and planned operations and
maintenance spending. This information as well as other data and information produced by
public institutions for the preparations for the workshop serves as a sound starting point for the
future work on operations and maintenance. Inaddition, a report was preparedby SPO with the
proceedings of the presentations delivered at the workshop and key issues that were identified as
well as suggested next steps.         Furthermore, five pilot agencies for establishing an O&M
framework have been identified by SPO. These agencies are Electricity Generation Company
(EUAS), General Directorate of Highways (KGM), General Directorate of Hydraulic Works
(DSI), Ministry ofEducationand MOH. The numberofpilot agenciescould be expanded.
145.     There is also increased flexibility granted to the line agencies in reducing the approval
requirements by SPO, such as in (i)      making changes in the subcomponents of projects and (ii)
reallocation of funds within the agencies' investment budget. This i s establishedby the Council
of Ministersdecree on the "Implementation, coordination and monitoring of the 2008 Program".
146.     This loan (PPDPL 2) recognizes the government's strong efforts to improve the link
between the resource allocation process and actual investment needs through, among other
actions,

         0   initiation of a study on assessment of the actual needs for maintenance expenditure;

         0   identification of at least five pilot public institutions for establishing an O&M
             framework with an aim to unify the definitions and classification of expenditures,
             improve needs assessment and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of O&M
             expenditures. This would pave the way for issuing public asset maintenance
             guidelines for all public institutions which will be supported under the follow up
             operation PPDPL 3.
147.     Inconclusion, the PPDPL 2 includes three core actions underthis component-requiring
satisfactory implementation of the PFM reforms in key areas. The summary presented above
indicates that there has been sufficient substantial progress in implementing key aspects of the
reform by, for instance: (a) requiring that a medium term strategy be the framework for



                                                  37

determining fiscal aggregates and linking sector budgets to policy priorities; (b) issuing all the
required secondary legislation essential for the implementation of the PFMC Law; (c)
establishing strategy development units in all general government institutions; (d) preparing
financial statements on accrual basis for the central government and local administrations; (e)
improving fiscal transparencythrough publishing a full list of tax expenditures; and, (0initiation
of a study on assessment of the actual needs for O&M expenditures and identification of at least
five public institutions.
COMPONENT      IV: PUBLICADMINISTRATIONANDGOVERNANCEREFORM
Improvingthe Justice System
148.     While actions in this area were only a tangential part of the original PPDPL program,
deeper dialogue with authorities on recent reforms, objective evidence about their success and
opportunities to promote further judicial reforms through the PPDPL series support the
importance of making this an area o f support under PPDPL 2. Legal and judicial reform has
become a significant topic since Turkey's official application for EUmembershipin 1999. Since
that time, the country has embarked on legal reform efforts focused on constitutional and legal
changes intended to strengthen democracy, the rule of law and the protection of human rights.
As a result of these efforts, Turkey now performs very well in comparison with EU and EU
accession members along various dimensions measured by surveys such as the 2005 Business
Environment and EnterprisePerformance Survey (BEEPS) jointly conducted by the World Bank
and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and 2006 Doing Business
(WB/IFC).      The performance of Turkish courts has improved significantly along most
dimensions of performance since 2002, according to BEEPS data, both in absolute terms and in
relation to the new EU members, including in areas such as independence, honesty, speed and
ability to enforce decisions. These improvements provide a foundation for enhancing judicial
service delivery, improving the business environment, and strengthening implementation of EU
legislation, which will be key criteria inassessing Turkey's readinessfor membership.
149.    Despite the gains, these performance improvements have been from a low 2002 base and
most firms still do not find Turkey's courts to be affordable, quick, impartial or consistent in
implementing laws. Turkish courts continue to face problems with backlogs and delays and
concerns about the quality ofjudicial process. Infact, only approximately 40 percent of all firms
felt that Turkish courts were fast.        While institutional changes have been adopted through
legislation, thejudiciary i s still perceived to be insufficiently independent from the executive.
150.    Since 2004, major reform efforts have been undertaken in the Turkish judicial system.
Substantial revisions have been made to main laws governing the system, namely the Criminal
Code, Criminal Procedural Code, Civil Code, Law on the Establishment of the Regional Courts
of Appeal, and the Law on the Establishment of Justice Academy. These legislative changes
have introduced new policies in the judicial system and strengthened the institutional structure.
In addition, drafts of the Commercial Code, Code of Obligations, Civil Procedural Code and
Administrative Procedure Code have beenprepared.
151.    Introduction of Alternative Disputes Resolution (ADR) is being considered in order to
reduce pressure on the courts. The preparation of a draft law on mediation i s on-going, and the
current draft of the Civil Procedure Code is expected to unify the rules governing international
and domestic arbitration. It is important for Turkey to develop a legal basis for mediation similar


                                                    38

to other EU countries. In parallel to the drafting o f the mediation law, the steps needed to
 establish its institutional base need to be considered.       One proposal originating from the
 commission preparing the draft law on mediation would be to establish mediation centers that
oversee the training and certification of mediators and disseminate information on new mediation
processes to the public.
 152.   The Ministry o f Justice has initiated a program for consolidating the courts through the
closing o f small remote courthouses and the design o f new, larger courthouses across the country
that consolidates judicial functions under one roof. The ministry has closed 137 small court
houses around the country that do not have sufficient workload. According to Ministry o f Justice,
as of December 2007, 66 courthouses have been constructed, 26 courthouses are under
construction, and 53 courthouses are in the planning or design phases. The budgetary allocation
for the judiciary has doubled from 2005 to 2007 (in Euro terms) allowing for significant
increases in the salaries o f judges. However, as a percentage o f GDP, the judicial budget has
increased only from 0.1 percent to 0.13 percent. Most EU countries, by comparison, spend
between0.2 to 0.4 percent o ftheir GDP on thejudiciary (based on EuropeanCommission for the
Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ) data for 2004).
 153.   Going forward, sustained efforts at implementing institutional changes are necessary to
fwrther improve the efficiency and effectiveness o f the system. First,judicial reforms should aim
to identify and develop sufficiently qualified and trained human resources and expand the
physical infrastructure available to the court system. Second, judicial reforms should promote
efficient and accountable management o f these resources and the increasing level o f financial
resources dedicated to the judicial system. Finally, judicial reforms should identify bottlenecks
and structural issues in the system and try to address them through legal and regulatory changes,
procedural reforms and institutional strengthening. On this basis, implementation o f new
electronic networks and automated processes will help develop and monitor reform outcome
indicators; such as lower case backlog, shorter duration o f cases, improved access to justice, and
betterpopular assessment o fjudicial quality.
 154.   A thorough implementation of the reforms discussed above would contribute to the
government's objectives of (i)better management o f resources and their allocation, (ii)  increased
efficiency o f the judicial process, (iii)
                                         improvedjudicial services, and (iv) reduction o f backlogs
of cases.
 155.   The Bank and the authorities have agreed that the Bank would provide support to the
judicial reforms under its PPDPL program with an aim to continue supporting Turkey's strides in
improving the justice system. The PPDPL 2 includes the following prior actions: (i)law for the
                                                                                      a
establishment o f Regional Courts o f Appeal has been enacted and made effective, in order to
ease the backlog o f cases within the Court o f Appeals; (ii) connections among courts have
                                                              online
beenestablished through satisfactorily implementation o f the National Judicial Network Project
(UYAP), (iii)training programs for judges and prosecutors through the National Justice
Academy have been expanded. The Justice Academy has assumed all the mandatory pre-service
training for candidate judges and prosecutors. The delivery o f the in-service training programs
has improved and optional foreign language courses are being offered.
156.    The establishment o f the Regional Courts of Appeals is an important step aimed at
easing the case load o f the Courts o f Appeals as well as allowing the Supreme Court to reduce its


                                                 39

caseload and play a guiding role for the judicial system. The law enabling establishment of
regional appeals courts was enacted in October 2004 (Law No: 5235 published in Official
Gazette on October 7, 2004) and became effective as of June 1, 2005. However, the MOJ does
not expect the courts to be operational until late 2009 or early 2010. This delay is due to the need
to identify and appoint judges and staff. The new courts cannot be fully operational without
appropriate staffing ofjudges, prosecutors and auxiliary personnel and without in-depth training
for this staff. Three regional courts of appeals located in Ankara, Erzurum and Diyarbakir are
being constructed with the support of EU funds and are expected to be completed by early
summer 2008. Additional regional appeal courthouses are expected to be completed in 2010
according to the MOJ. Notwithstanding EU-supported training assistance for judges, prosecutors
and court staff who could work in the regional appeals courts, identifying, appointing and
training judges and court staff i s the critical bottleneck slowing the operation of the regional
appeals courts.
 157.   An advanced National Judicial Network Project (UYAP) became operational during
2007. UYAP has been designed in order to improve the functioning of the judiciary and its
connection to all other governmental institutions. Judges and prosecutors have been provided
with personal computers, and a web site has beenconstructed that provides free access tojudicial
personnel and contains the case law of the higher courts. More than 90 percent of courthouses
are connectedto the system. UYAP provides judges and others with: (i) database of legislative
                                                                           a
changes; (ii)higher court and European Court of Justice decisions; (iii)a case distribution
system; (iv) electronic evidence with e-signatures; and (v) e-filing and electronic tracking of
cases by lawyers. UYAP requires additional resources in order to produce the judicial statistics
necessary for the government to monitor case flow and backlogs; provide specific data on types
of cases and their processing times and evaluate the progress on implementing judicial reforms.
UYAP also requires an integrated resource management system in order to achieve its primary
goal and the integration of an automatedcase management system. While an EUproject on case
management likely will provide the latter assistance, additional resources and efforts are needed
to bring the UYAP system to a satisfactory level of operation.
 158.   The independenceof the Justice Academy needs to be further strengthened (two out of
seven Board members are from MOJ and 12 out of 29 members of the general assembly
overseeing the Academy are either MOJ directors or closely associated with the MOJ). Progress
has beenmade since the establishment of the NationalJustice Academy in2002 inproviding pre-
service and in-service training to judges, prosecutors and court personnel. The Justice Academy
has assumed all the mandatory pre-service training for candidate judges and prosecutors. The
delivery o f the in-service training programs has significantly improved, and optional foreign
language courses are now being offered by the Justice Academy. A total of 1306prosecutors and
judges have received pre-service training in 2007 and a total of 2666 judges and prosecutors
received in-service training from the Justice Academy during 2004-2007.              However, the
Academy lacks sufficient institutional and human resources capacity and does not have the
authority to hire permanent trainers. Also, the institution has not yet developed a comprehensive
training strategy and curricula to respondto the most up-to-date needs ofjudges and prosecutors,
particularly in areas of commercial law. Inaddition, the role of the MOJ's Training Department
should be clarified inorder to avoid overlaps with the activities of the Academy inthe area of in-
service training.

 159.      Inconclusion, the PPDPL 2 includes two core actions for improving the justice system.
The summary presented above indicates that there has been sufficient substantial progress in
implementing key aspects o f the reform (a) enactment o f the law for the establishment of
Regional Courts o f Appeals; and (b) establishment o f online connections among courts through
satisfactorily implementation o fthe National Judicial Network Project (UYAP).
Decentralization
 160.      The Turkish public sector is highly centralized. Local administrations account for only
about 10 percent o f general government expenditures.                 The government has embarked on a
gradual process o f decentralization.
 161.      The Government is aware that successful decentralization will require improvements in
the technical capacity o f local administrations and improvements inlocal accountability and that
any decentralization o f expenditure responsibilities must be matched by a corresponding
adjustment in revenues. The targeting o f intergovernmental transfers i s another key issue, given
the wide disparities in tax bases among Turkey's 3,225 municipalities and 81 provinces. Inan
attempt to tackle the growing stock o f municipal arrears, the Government has completed a
restructuring program in2007. It i s critical to design and implementnecessary measures to avoid
buildingup ofnew arrears.
162.       The Government's overall objective i s to position local administrations to deliver the
public services for which they are responsible in an efficient and responsive manner.                          The
Government's program includes:
               a revision o f the legislative framework o f all three categories o f local
               administrations",     consolidating small local administrations into viable units,
               improving local accountability mechanisms, and improving controls over staffing
               levels and recruitment;
              training programs for mayors and local administrators to ensure effective
               implementationof the new laws

           0   changes in the level and targeting o f intergovernmental transfers and the assignment
               o f local taxes and fees; and

           0   steps to reduce the existing stock o f municipal arrears and avoid new arrears;
163.      The first PPDPL supported: (1) the enactment of legislation, governing municipalities,
metropolitan municipalities, and Special Provincial Administrations (SPAs); (2) the restructuring
o f municipal arrears; and (3) the preparation o f a satisfactory draft law on provincial and
municipal revenues.
164.      The Municipalities Law enacted in July 2005 required the consolidation of small
municipal governments into administratively viable units (with a minimumpopulation o f 2,000).
As a result, 863 municipalities have beenredefinedas villages and are under the jurisdiction o f

I1Turkey's national territory is divided into 81 provinces, each headed by a centrally appointed governor. Urban
areas within provinces are organized as municipalities (of which there are 3,225). Rural areas are under the direct
control of the provincial governments and are administered by Special Provincial Administrations (SPAs). The 16
officially-designatedmetropolitanareas have a two tier structure, in which individual municipalities are subordinate
to a metropolitanmunicipality.


                                                        41

 SPAs. It improved accountability by requiring councils to meet on a monthly basis and
permitting local stakeholder participation in special commission o f municipal councils. The new
Law on SPAs, similarly, improves accountability by permitting elected provincial assemblies to
appoint their own chief executive officers. Analogous changes were made in the Metropolitan
Municipalities Law, enacted inJuly 2004.
 165.    With respect to arrears, restructuringagreements have beenreached with three-quarters o f
the municipalities (covering an estimated 70 percent o f the stock) and are now under
implementation. Six water and sewerage institutions o f the metropolitan municipalities have also
reached agreement on their arrear restructuring. Safeguards have been put in place to ensure
against a repetition. The Government i s now authorized to withhold up to 20 percent o f the
monthly revenues of municipalities to recover arrears on current account and an additional 20
percent to recover debt service due on the restructured debt.
 166.    Since the approval o f the first PPDPL, the Government has taken several significant steps
in furtherance of its decentralization agenda. The secondary legislation required for the
implementation o f the Metropolitan Municipalities Law, the SPAs Law and the Municipalities
Law has been completed. In 2007, 5 implementingcirculars have beenissued including (i)        norm
cadre principles and standards for municipalities, municipal enterprises, local administration
service unions and SPAs, (ii)procurement o f rural services, and (iii)    recruitment procedures for
local administrations staff.
167.     Inaccordance with the Government's program, a satisfactory draft SPA and Municipality
Revenue Law had been prepared prior to the approval o f the first PPDPL, and this law was
submitted to Parliament on September 26, 2006.           Since that time, the legislation has been
extensively debated. A moderately revised version o f the legislation i s now under consideration.
The current version would make two major changes in the existing structure o f local
administrations' revenues. First, it would increase the overall volume o f central government
transfers by expanding the definition o f central government taxes subject to sharing. If fully
implementedin2009, the total volume o f revenue sharing would increase by about 26 percent or
0.5 percent o f GDP. Second, it would change the distribution o f revenue sharing among
categories o f local administrations and would introduce two new criteria into the distribution o f
these shares. These would include indicators o f poverty (such as a provincial development
index) and a performance index.
168.     The Government is aware that the proposed increase intransfers will impose a net cost on
the central government budget unless it is accompanied by a corresponding decentralization o f
expenditure responsibilities. Some efforts at functional decentralization have already been
undertaken. The Government has abolished the Rural Services General Directorate and
transferred its responsibilities and staff to the SPAs (although the Government continues to pay
their salaries on an interim basis.) The Government is now considering a transfer of certain
functions in fields of social services, culture, tourism, youth and sports. In its 2008 annual
program, the Government declared that the legislation that establishes all central government
institutions will be reviewed. This will be based on a functional review by the SPO and i s
intendedto the clarify roles and responsibilities o f each tier o f government.
169.    The Government is also taking measures to rein in other fiscal risks o f decentralization.
(See Annex IX). The Municipalities Law limits the total stock o f municipal debt to 100 percent



                                                  42

of current revenues (150 percent inthe case o f metropolitan municipalities) and requires Ministry
of Interior approval for any borrowing that would increase the debt-revenue ratio above ten
percent. The Law No. 6183 on Public Receivables and the Law No. 4749 on Public Finance and
Debt Management permit the Government to deduct debt service owed by local administrations
to the Treasury and other public entities from intergovernmental transfers. The proposed new
municipal revenues law would facilitate that process by permitting the Government (via Iller
Bank) to deduct up to 40 percent o f local administration transfers for this purpose at the
discretion of the Minister responsible for the Treasury. Law No. 4749 and its implementing
regulation as well as annual Budget Laws set limits for municipal external borrowing under
Treasury guarantees.
170.    In addition, the PFMC Law requires local administrations to submit periodic financial
reports to the Government, enabling the Government to better monitor their financial condition.
In2006, MOF started gathering quarterly local administrations financial data on an accrual basis.
In 2007, the General Directorate o f Local Administrations within the Ministry of Interior
published the general activity report for local administrations. Based on the quarterly data, the
report makes available consolidated expenditures o f local administrations both by economic and
functional classification. The report provides information on a wide range o f activities o f the
local administrations.      The report aims to shed light on budget outcomes and levels o f
indebtedness, human resources, physical capital and investments o f SPAS, municipalities and
local administration unions.
171.    These achievements are reflected in the policy matrix for PPDPL 2. As shown in Annex
11, these call specifically for the implementation o f the new legislative framework for local
administrations, the completion o f the secondary legislation required for its implementation, and
the submissiono fa satisfactory law on SPA and municipality revenuesto Parliament.
Regional Development
172.    Regional economic disparities in Turkey are considerably wider than in EU countries and
have persisted over time". This concerns the Government, in part because these disparities are
reflected inrelatively low levels o f household income and social conditions incertain parts of the
country. Economic disparities may also reflect a failure to exploit economic development
opportunities inpoorer regions.
173.    The Government has made regional development a priority. It i s one o f five development
axes in Turkey's Ninth Development Plan. The Government's 2008 Annual Program provides
the policy framework for four components under the regional development axis; namely: (i)
increasing the effectiveness o f regional development policies at the central level; (ii)           achieving
development based on local dynamics; (iii)improving institutional capacity at the local level and
(iv) promoting rural development.
174.    The Government's immediate objectives include: (i)designing and implementing a
national strategy for regional development, aligning investment programs and priorities with
regional needs, (ii) building capacity inDAs and ensuring that they function effectively and inan
accountable manner, and (iii)effectively managing the EU funds for regional development.

                                                   43

Interest in regional development has also been strengthened by the EU accession process.
Regional development is one of the five components of the EU's Instrument for Pre-Accession
Assistance (IPA), which provides the financial framework for EU funds for the period 2007-
2013.
175.     The PPDPL program supports the Government's efforts to:
            strengthenthe framework for the coordination of regional policies at the national level
            and for regional development strategies of each region through the preparation of a
            national level regional development strategy,
            complete the legal and operational framework for the establishment and functioning
            of DAs and improve their capacity to planand execute regional plans at the regional
            level, and
            make effective use of EUIPA funds.
176.    Preparation o f a national level regional development strategy is already underway. Once
completed, the national level strategy will establish a framework for the coordination of regional
policies at the national level and for the preparation of regional development strategies in the
regions. In February 2008, SPO hosted a workshop on the initial findings of the World
Development Report (WDR) 2009 on spatial disparities and a discussion of the subject by
participants from other key public institutions, private sector and academia. The event took place
as part of the continuous dialogue with the authorities on regional development policies and has
aimed to contribute to the ongoing preparation of the national level strategy. In addition, the
Government has identified fifteen "growth p01es"'~ which would be the focus of regional
development efforts.
177.     Substantial progress has also been made on the establishment of DAs. In 2006, the
government announced its intention to create DAs in the each of the country's 26 NUTS-2
regions. These would operate largely in a planning and coordination role, supporting the
implementation of regional plans and programs and coordinating activities of sectoral ministries
and local units of government. Inthis context, the first PPDPL called for the enactment of a law
authorizing the establishment of DAs. The Law No. 5449 was ratified and came into force in
February 2006. The law outlines the duties, powers and organizational structure of the agencies
and requires the establishment of DAs inthe 26 NUTS-2 regions. It assigns DAs several sources
of revenues, including fixed shares of central and local administration revenues, along with
access to EU funds and contributions from local chambers of industry and commerce. The State
Planning Organization (SPO) is designated as the national level coordination body for the
agencies. Each agency is to be establishedthrough a Council of Ministers Decree.
178.    Two DAs have now been established under a Council of Ministers Decree dated July
2006. One i s TR62 (Adana and Mersin provinces) and the other TR31 (Izmir). In both DAs,
Administrative Boards (decision making bodies) and Development Councils (advisory bodies)
have become operational and have initiated work on identifying their short term "pre-
development strategies", while the General Secretaries of the agencies have been appointed.


13The fifteen provinces identified as growth poles are: Diyarbakir, Elazig, Erzurum, Gaziantep, Kayseri, Malatya,
Samsun, Sivas, Sanliurfa, Trabzon, Van, Batman, Kastamonu, Kars and Kahramanmaras.


                                                        44

Secondly, regulations on (i)personnel policy and management, (ii)working principles o f the
DAs and (iii) and accountingprincipleswere issuedinJuly and September 2006. Finally,
               budget
at the end of 2006, personnel examinations have been completed for both DAs. Twenty-seven
new staff has been recruited for Adana/Mersin DA and twenty-six have been recruited for the
Izmir DA. The process o f establishing DAs was temporarily halted in 2007, due to a challenge to
their constitutionality. While the Constitutional Court's decision, rendered in November 2007,
annulled certain provisions affecting the appointment o f staff and tax exemptions, it left the
remainder o f the DA law intact enabling the Government to establish new DAs and permitting
the existing agencies to fully operate.      The Government also plans to establish investment
support offices ineach province ineach o f the regions.
179.     It is expected that about five new DAs will be established until the end o f 2008.
Furthermore, the secondary legislationwill be completed in2008 and all new agencies thereafter.
The drafts o f five new regulations are under preparation on the establishment o f investment
promotion offices, audit o f the agencies, project support, performance measurement and inter-
DA collaboration.
180.     The Government has also taken steps to ensure the effective absorption o f EU funds. In
2006, the Prime Ministry issued a circular setting out the framework for monitoring three EU-
supported regional development programs. The M&E activities o f the four regional development
programs which are being implemented in 9 NUTS 2 regions have been performed by the
personnel o f project implementation and coordination units in the regions, and by Governor's
staff inprovinces. In2007, the Government prepared a "Strategic Coherence Framework" which
provides a general framework for the operational programs under the regional development and
human resources development components o f IPA.               The 2007-2009 Indicative Financial
Framework envisages Euro 524 million envelope will be used for regional development in
Turkey, under three operational programs; regional competitiveness,               environment and
transportation.
181.    Reflecting these achievements, the PPDPL 2 supports in particular the satisfactory
implementation o f the DA law, as evidenced by (1) the issuance o f regulations on the role o f
DAs, use o f funds, personnel policy and management, budgetary and accounting standards,
performance measurement criteria and audit requirement for all DAs, (2) satisfactory progress
on the establishment and operationalization o f at least two DAs and (3) the establishment of the
legal basis for allocating budgetary resources to at least one pilot growth pole. The Government
has satisfiedthese conditions.
FUTURE    PROGRAMAND POSSIBLE PPDPL3
182.    The government is committed to continue implementingthe reforms with a well-specified
medium-term program. Inthis context, the authorities have requested the Bank to follow PPDPL
2 with a third operation (PPDPL 3) as the achievement o f the program objectives depends
critically on consistent implementation and further deepening o f structural reforms supported
under the PPDPL series. The new CPS for 2008-2001 1 envisages the third operation inFY09 but
the authorities and Bank staff will consider when to present to the Board of Executive Directors
PPDPL 3 for approval dependingthe actual progress inkey reform areas.
183.    PPDPL 3 i s expected to support the implementation o f the government's medium-term
program o f legal, institutional, and structural policy actions to consolidate fiscal adjustment and


                                                  45

modernize the institutions and procedures of public sector management and service delivery.
Accordingly, PPDPL 3 will also support actions infour components, namely: (a) maintaining the
currently enabling macroeconomic framework; (b) reforming substantially the country's social
security and social assistance system; (c) continuing the on-going process of upgrading the
financial controls and expenditure management of public resource; and (d) improving the
administration and governanceof the public sector.
184.     More specifically, Table 5 presents a list of policy actions, milestones that are in the
government program and which could be supported under PPDPL 3. The table also presents (in
bold) the indicative triggers agreed by the government as key program indicators to justify
moving to PPDPL 3.
185.     Implementation of the social security reform will be a priority for the government's
program planned to be supported by PPDPL 3. In 2006, Parliament passed a landmark reform,
including parametric changes in the pension system and the introduction of UHI. In December
2006, the Constitutional Court canceled articles related to civil servants-effectively                     blocking
the implementation of the law. The Government has amended the Law No. 5510 to address
Constitutional Court ruling by the Law No. 5754 enacted on May 8, 2008. Full implementation
ofthe law will be supportedunder the third operation.
186.     The authorities and the Bank staff have identified five key policy actions as indicative
triggers for proceeding with the planned PPDPL 3. The selection of these key actions recognizes
the fact that the government has adopted a medium term program that is anchored to the EU
accessionprocess, but with flexibility inthe timing and sequencing of reforms. Priorities within
the overall public sector reform program may change as EUnegotiations advance and so may the
preferences regarding the specific subjects of Bank support within the wider government
program.

 *Detailedanalysis of the economic policy relevanceof policy actionsto be supported under PPDPL 3 is presented
 in Annex I1and summarized inthe following section on the expected outcomesof the program

PROGRAM GOALS         AND EXPECTED        OUTCOMES
187.     The goals of the program are summarized in the first column of Table 6, the expected
program outcomes in the immediate years after PPDPL 3 are identified in the second column,
and the contribution o f the program to CPS objectives (outcomes the WBG expects to influence
duringthe CPS period) are presentedinthe third column.
188.     It should be noted, however, that the program's key outcomes will take time to be
realized -in the case of parametric pension reform the outcome o f fiscal sustainability will take a
number of generations to be obtained. In other cases, there will be significant lags betweenthe
realization of outcomes and the ability to monitor them -such i s likely to be the case o f having
well functioning DAs and the ability to measure substantial development at the regional level.

Therefore, an effort has beenmade infinding short-term outcomesthat couldbe measured during
programimplementationand which would be proxies for the longer-termoutcomessought by the
programand which, for its very nature, couldbe achievedquickly.
189.     The key long term public policy outcomes will be ultimately realized well beyond the
time frame of the program. Continuedprogress towards meetingthe ultimate long term goals of
the programwill be monitoredover time.
190. The program is expected to make a significant contribution to the objectives set in the
CPS of (a) making the economy more resilient to crises that disproportionately affect the most
vulnerable; (b) contributing to sustainable economic growth that i s critical to pull many of the
poor out of poverty; (c) promoting human development; (d) improving efficiency and
effectiveness in public services; (e) strengthening the public service governance and judicial
services; and (f) reducing regional differences by improving the delivery of and access to
services, and creatingjobs indisadvantagedareas.

                             VI.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
191.      The actions and reforms supported under this PPDPL 2 program are expected to have,
overall, positive distributional and poverty impacts in Turkey. Ina broader context, the program
aims to contribute to macroeconomic stability by maintaining an enabling macroeconomic
environment and by improving fiscal sustainability of the social security system-ultimately
creating fiscal space for growth enhancing expenditures. The recent past provides evidence o f
how effective a sustained high growth could be in reducing poverty as about 7 million people
were pulled out o f poverty since 2003. In a more specific context, several o f the actions
supported under the program are expected to have direct positive impacts, most importantly the
implementation o f the UHI. Several others, including the pension reform under the revised
Social Security and UHI Law, are expected to have more indirect, albeit important, positive
impacts (See Annex VIII).
192.      Poverty. The PPDPL program is expected to contribute to a long-term positive impact
on poverty in Turkey, as it i s designed to increase the sustainability, effectiveness and coverage
o f the social security system and social safety-net. Turkey has made considerable progress in
reducing poverty: between 2002 and 2006, Turkey's boom led to a significant reduction in the
share o f the population living inpoverty - albeit at a somewhat slower pace than could have been
hoped for, According to official statistics, overall poverty declined from 27 percent to around 18
percent between 2002 and 2006. Rural poverty rates decreased little, however, increasing the
stark differences betweenurban and rural living standards.
193.      The low rate of extreme poverty is reflective both o f Turkey's per capita income level as
well as o f the importance of existing formal and informal social safety-nets. The informal safety


                                                      50

 net, where neighbors and extended family members provide help in times of dire straits, is an
 important feature o f Turkey's society. However, with migration, reduced family sizes (reflective
 o f the significant reduction in fertility rates in Turkey) urbanization and modernization, this
 traditional informal social safety-net has started to change as has been demonstrated from the
 results o f qualitative poverty analysis undertaken inthe context o f the preparation o f the PPDPL.
 Thus over time, the institutional social safety-net - most importantly access to free health
 insurance, a conditional cash transfer program reaching 2.6 million children, as well as direct and
 in-kind support through local solidarity foundations - has become more important to help
 families and individuals in social risk management and the prevention o f poverty. Important
 coverage gaps remain, though. Access to the formal social security networks has remained low;
 however, as job creation has taken place in the informal sector, due to the high costs o f
 compliance with formal social security requirements inthe formal sector. Around 50 percent o f
the working population is not covered under the social security system, a proportion which is
 bigger among the lower age cohorts. The reforms under the PPDPL series aim to address these
 issues by strengthening the social security system, ensuring its long-term fiscal sustainability,
reducing the costs o f compliance, extending coverage and ensuring that social assistance receives
 adequate financing and i s targeted more effectively.
 194.    UHI component of revised Social Security and UHI Law is expected to have direct
positive distributional and poverty impacts if coverage expansion and exemptions are realized as
planned. Government plans to extend free formal health insurance coverage to all those falling
below a specific level o f per capita income. The Law also introduces several partial premium
 subsidies for today's uncovered population that does not qualify for free coverage but will be
protected from full premium payments. The realization o f such potential positive impacts will
depend on a number o f factors, however, including design and implementation of premium
contribution exemption policy, effective delivery o f a package o f health services and maintaining
the fiscal sustainability o f the health system as the health costs have risen fast inthe recent past.
Pension component o f revised Social Security and UHILaw i s expected to have indirect positive
distributional and poverty impacts as the reform i s geared to make the system fiscally sustainable
as well as to improve horizontal equity. The use o f such fiscal space will depend on economic
and social considerations in the fkture but it would allow for additional expenditures which are
potentially more progressive than the current tax financing o f the deficit that does not benefit the
poor. The parametric reforms would also strengthen the expected benefits from formalization
from the workers' perspective by increasing the likelihood o f pension payments inthe future and
would contribute to formalization inthe economy.
 195,    Apart from the above direct (UHI) and more indirect (pension parametric reform) poverty
and distributional impacts, several other PPDPL 2 supported reforms and actions also have the
potential o f benefiting the poor (See Annex VIII) but, at this stage, the materialization o f such
benefits are somewhat more removed from those pertaining to the policy actions mentioned
above. Given the high degree o f dependence o f the more vulnerable population on public
services (infrastructure, household basic services, and social services), improvements o f public
service deliver and strategic planning are of particular importance for the poorer parts o f society.
Better judicial services have potential to benefit population at large by improving access to
justice services, including the more vulnerable and contributing to improving the business
environment and confidence in the economy eventually leading to better labor market outcomes.

Better focused regional development efforts and more effective provision of public services at
the local levelwill assist inincreasingincome levels inthe lagging regions andthe poor.
 196.   Gender. The reforms supported by the PPDPL program are likely to have a positive
impact on women. Women will benefit disproportionately from the introduction of UHI, where
those currently uncovered (estimated at between 6 and 22 percent of the population) will be
provided with full basic health coverage for the first time. Currently those without formal
coverage, and many of those with Green Card coverage, receive rudimentary or even no basic
health care, although critical health conditions are invariably treated by hospitals even when the
patient has no coverage. This results in many simple health problems escalating to more acute
conditions. Although there is little evidence of the uninsuredbeing refusedcare, there are clearly
increases in female morbidity and a general lack of efficiency resulting from this very imperfect
system. Extending improved quality ante-natal and other health care services to all women
through UHI will result in a major welfare gain and help Turkey to meet its Millennium
Development Goals on infant and maternal mortality.
197.    Inthe case ofpension reform, the issues are more nuancedandcomplex. Currently, as in
many countries, women working in the formal sector effectively gain a higher rate of return on
their pension contributions due to a lower retirement age and greater longevity. However,
relatively few women are currently contributing (or beneficiaries) of the pension system and the
fiscal sustainability - and with it the likelihood of the pension system actually rewarding those
that have contributed during the working life - is low. While the pension reform supported by
the PPDPL series equalizes the pro-female difference in the current system, it will raise the
likelihood of receiving pension payments significantly. It is also expected, and Government is
making significant efforts through other reforms, to increase the effective protection of the work
force by encouraging formal and more flexible employment, which should especially impact on
the share ofthe female work force coveredby the pension regime inthe future.
IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING EVALUATION
                                    AND

198.    The Undersecretariat of the Treasury will be responsible for coordinating actions among
other concerned ministries and agencies. A number of other agencies are involved in the
implementation of the public sector reform program being supported by the PPDPL program
including the Prime Ministry, SPO, MOF, Ministry of Justice, MOH, Ministry of Labor and
Social Security (MOLSS), Ministryof Interior, TCA and SSI.
199.    As part of the PPDPL preparation process, the Bank has discussed with both the MOLSS
and the SSI the development of an ongoing M&Eprocess of the social security reforms to ensure
adequate feedback from beneficiaries to policy-makers. This qualitative feedback mechanism
will complement the ongoing quantitative poverty monitoring which is undertaken annually (and
continuously) since 2002 by the TURKSTAT, supportedby the SRMP loan and which would be
supported also by the HTP. M&E i s traditionally a weak area within the Turkish social sector
ministries, but there is a strong understanding of the need to strengthen such mechanisms. The
Bank has worked to strengthen both quantitative and qualitative monitoring mechanisms in the
Directorate General of Social Assistance and Solidarity (SYDGM), MOH, Social Services &
Child Protection Organization (SHCEK) and the Ministryof National Education. The system for
the MOLSS and SSI are supportedunderthe HTP.

200.    Bank staff will focus on the impact outcomes o f the program and the adjustments that
need to be made to the operation as it evolves, to take into account the latest country
developments, stakeholder support, and feasible options for realizing the intended development
goals. The review will be largely based on the monitoring indicators (benchmarks) and the goals
of the program. At the same time, the overall status o f the government's program will be
monitored to determine whether country conditions and the specific conditions o f the proposed
operation have beenmet.
FIDUCIARY   ASPECTS
201.    Modernization o f Turkey's system o f public financial accountability in line with
international standards was an urgent PEM priority. Enactment o f the PFMC Law in 2003
marked a defining moment for the PFM. The PFMC Law defines the new principals, rules and
structures for the Turkish PFM systems including budget formulation and execution, financial
and internal control systems, and internal and external audit structures.      The budgets and
indicative proposals for the following two years are prepared according to the functional,
economic and institutional classifications defined under the PFMC Law.          The Government
Finance Statistics (GFS) analytical budget classification and the accrual based accounting
systems have been expanded to all general government institutions,               including local
administrations.    The MOF is able to consolidate the budget realization for all general
government institutions.     Periodic financial statements are prepared regularly and on time.
GDPA prepares aggregated financial reports for the central government, which are publishedas a
monthly bulletin. The PFMC Law has transferred the authority to incur expenditures and provide
other approvals for expenditures above predetermined thresholds (internal control over budget
expenditures) to the Strategy Development Units established within each public administration.
The most important positive feature o f the PFMC Law is that it combines duties and
responsibilities in a single spending authority who incurs expenditures and i s kept accountable.
The PFMC Law has also introduced a modern internal audit framework. With devolution o f
authority and responsibility to spending agencies, the need has increased for a modern internal
audit organization that can assure the head o f the spending agency on the soundness o f the
internal control system. The PFMC Law requires each public administration to establish an
internal audit unit withinits administration.
202.    Accounting. An automated online accounting system has beenimplemented. The MOF
developed in-house an automated online accounting system, Say2OOOi system has been up and
running since 2002. The system networks and captures receipts and payments from more than
1,500 sites o f the MOF's GDPA across Turkey as they are made. The system can produce
periodic financial statements and covers all general budgetary institutions except the Office o f
the President and accounting office for the State Debt within the Treasury. The initiative to
introduce modified accrual accounting incompliance with GFS requirements i s making progress.
Turkey has consciously switched from cash-based to an accrual basis o f accounting. A uniform
chart o f accounts that i s harmonized with budget classification has been implemented. The
GDPA has issued a new framework for the accrual-based chart o f accounts. It i s harmonized
with the economic classification o f the newly adopted GFS budget classification system. The
new chart o f accounts enabled the GDPA to compile financial statements consistent with the
2001-GFS budget classification.     Article 49 o f the PFMC Law mandates that accounting be
harmonized with the international standards, and standards be issued by a Government


                                                53

Accounting Standards Board (GASB), which was established as the general government's sole
standard-setting authority, and has been operating since June 2006. The GASB i s under the
MOF, comprised o f representatives from the TCA, State Planning Organization (SPO), MOF,
Treasury, and other agencies.
203.     Procurement. Turkey has moved decisively to upgrade its public procurement
legislation and practices in line with international standards. The current Public Procurement
Law was enacted in2002. The Law is based on the UnitedNations Commission on International
Standards (UNCITRAL) Model and moves Turkey in the direction o f compliance with EU
standards. The independent PPA established by law to oversee public procurement and ensure
enforcement o f the new procurement standards is fully operational. The Government i s working
on new procurement legislation for SOEs in the public utilities sectors consistent with the
relevant EU directive in order to improve operational efficiency o f the SOEs. Benchmarking o f
Turkey's public procurement system against an internationally recognized baseline o f best
practice in procurement was carried out jointly by the World Bank and the Turkish PPA in
February 2006 and updated in October 2007. The benchmarking included analysis of four main
pillars: legislative and regulatory framework (Pillar I);institutional framework and institutional
capacity (Pillar 11); procurement operations and market practices (Pillar 111); and the integrity o f
procurement systems (Pillar IV). It showed that the country achieved its greatest progress and
most impressive results in the area o f legislative and regulatory framework (Pillar I),     and in
improving integrity o f the national public procurement system (Pillar IV). Further improvements
in the public procurement are nevertheless critical for efficient functioning o f the system. The
important areas requiring attention are: (a) lowering o f the threshold for publication o f contract
award decisions; (b) eliminating restrictions in the form o f thresholds for participation by
international bidders; and (c) simplifying dispute resolution system. Finally, selection o f
consulting services procedures would benefit from use o f quality-and-cost based selection
system, particularly for the assignments that require high competence and relevant experience.
Turkey is one ofthe countries where the Bank had consultations for the use o f country systems in
procurement inNovember 2007, and the Bank received an official request from the Government
to participate as one o f the pilot countries in January 2008. The Government proposed two
phased approach, whereby the first phase would address country level procurement assessment,
policy analysis and capacity development and the second phase to pilot the use with a sector or a
project to be selected by the Government. Subject to the Bank Board approval o f the pilot plan,
next steps will follow.
204.     Auditing.    Effective financial accountability requires extensive modernization of
Turkey's public audit system.          The objectives are twofold: (a) clarify institutional
responsibilities, promote improvements in audit quality in line with international standards and
support the shift from ex-ante controls to ex-post monitoring in harmony with the efforts to
improve operational performance; and (b) expand the scope o f TCA audits to cover the entire
general government including local administrations, autonomous agencies, social security
institutions, remaining extra-budgetary funds and revolving funds, with the overall objective of
transforming the TCA into an effective state audit institution.      These objectives have been
facilitated by enactment of the PFMC Law and will further be completed through enactment o f
the new TCA law. The PFMC Law established a framework for decentralizing internal audit to
the line agencies inline with EUrequirements. It discontinuedthe TCA's involvement inbudget



                                                54

execution and focused on ex-post audits, including performance audits. The TCA i s committed
to undertake internal reforms to align its institutional structure with international standards for
state audit institutions, to upgrade its audit capabilities, and to reach consensus with the other
government audit bodies on implementation o f the reform. A draft action plan for the TCA's
internal reform has been prepared and will be improved, including through a peer review by
auditors from other European state audit institutions. The action plan i s expected to be adopted
by the Government and TCA after the enactment o fthe TCA Law.
DISBURSEMENT AUDITING
                  AND

205.   Disbursementand ImplementationArrangements. The proposed loan will follow the
Bank's disbursement procedures for DPLs. The untied balance o f payments support will be
disbursed against satisfactory implementation o f the program and not tied to any specific
purchases and no procurement requirements will be needed. Upon approval o f the loan and
notification by the Bank o f Loan effectiveness, the Government will submit a withdrawal
application. The IBRD will deposit the proceeds o f the loan with the CBRT, which will form
part o f the official FX reserves at the request o f the Undersecretariat o f Treasury.       The
government will utilize the proceeds o f the loan in foreign currency for either foreign debt
servicing or for crediting the local currency equivalent into the treasury single account for
financing budgeted expenses. Prior to that, the borrower will pay a front-end fee amounting to
0.25 percent o f the loan amount from its own resources. If, after deposit in this CBRT account,
the proceeds of the loan are usedfor ineligible purposes (for example, to finance items imported
from nonmember countries or goods or services on the IBRD standard negative list), the IBRD
will require the borrower to either: (a) return that amount to the account for use for eligible
purposes; or (b) refund the amount directly to the IBRD, in which case the IBRD will cancel an
equivalent undisbursedamount o f the loan.
206.   Accounts, Auditing and Closing Date. The administration o f this loan will be the
responsibility o f the Undersecretariat o f Treasury. The government will maintain accounts and
records, or ensure that such items are maintained, showing that loan disbursements were in
accordance with provision o f the Loan Agreement. Such accounts and records will be
maintained ina form acceptable to the Bank. The IMF had conducted a safeguards assessment o f
the CBRT inApril 2002 and determinedthat, while number of measures was taken to strengthen
the CBRT, such as the conduct of a quality external audit and the preparation of financial
statements according to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), there remained a
number of vulnerabilities that needed to be addressed.             The assessment recommended
reorganization o f the internal audit function, expansion o f the role o f the audit committee,
publication o f IFRS financial statements, and reconciliation o f program monetary data with the
audited financial statements, includingan audit o f the treasury component. Since then CBRT has
taken a number measures including reconciliation o f monetary data with audited financial
statements and its audit by the independent auditor, publication o f annual audited financial
statements and the independent auditors report, reorganization o f internal audit function,
including the adoption o f a new charter and the appointment o f the head o f the internal audit
department. The audit reports by independent auditors on the financial statements o f the CBRT
for the year 2005, 2004 and 2003 provided a clean audit opinion. Past audits and generally
positive assessment by the IMF indicate that there are no strong reasons for asking additional



                                                 55

safeguards such as audit of deposit account. As a result o f the above, no audit will be necessary
underthis loan. The closing date of the loanwill be June 30, 2009.
ENVIRONMENTAL       ASPECTS
207.    Because of the nature of the policy actions supported under the program and the
substantial long-term positive impact on poverty which is envisaged as a result of PPDPL series,
this operation in unlikely to have any significant negative effects on the environment. Having
said this, it is useful to characterize some of the potential environmental risks associated with
expected policy reforms.
208.    Public sector reform programs of the type supported by PPDPL 2 embrace expenditure
frameworks, budget transparency, accountability, better financial management, and improved
service delivery. The overall emphasis on improving governance and quality of spending and
enhancing the transparency with which resources are allocated should improve environmental
spending along with other forms.        Thus, in principle, these reforms will be positive for
environmental institutions, unless fiscal contraction falls disproportionately on such institutions,
which is not envisagedunder PPDPL 2.
209.    Improved coverage of the pension and health insurance systems i s expected to have a
greater impact on the urban formal wage sector, perhaps increasing the incentive for rural
workers to seek formal urban wage employment, increasing the burden on urban services, and
contributing to urban environmental problems.             Conversely, there could be reduced
environmental degradationinrural areas because of rural-to-urban migration.
210.    Turkey's environmental priorities are outlined invarious strategy documents focused on
several areas including Turkey's National Report on Sustainable Development (2002) prepared
for the Johannesburg Summit, the environmental chapter of Turkey's National Program for the
Adoption of the Acquis (2001), and the National Environmental Action Plan (1998). A number
of sectoral strategies complement these national reports, such as the Nutrient Reduction Action
Plan (2002) which focuses on efforts to reduce agricultural waste runoff to the Black Sea; the
National Forest Program (2004), which considers the scope for improving forest management;
and the National Strategy and Plan of Action on Biodiversity (2001) which outlines Turkey's
commitments as a signatory to the Convention on Biodiversity. Protected Area Management
Plans have been prepared in a participatory manner at the four sites (Sultansazligi, Igneada,
Camili and Koprulu Kanyon) with strong local consultation on land use and zoning of the
protected areas. Unfortunately to date only one management plan (Sultan Sazligi) has been
approved after modification to present it as the Long-term Development Plan required under
current legislation.
211.    Inurban areas, Turkey's environmental challenges are primarily associated with air and
noise pollution, industrial waste management, waste water management, sanitation, and access to
clean water, complicated by the burden of providing urban housing and services to accommodate
the growing number of rural-to-urban migrants. In rural areas, environmental degradation is
most profoundly felt amongst upland communities where soil loss and deforestation have
reducedthe agricultural sector's productive capacity.
212.    The EU is providing assistance to the government to build capacity for environmental
management, regulation, enforcement and monitoring, as well as for developing revised legal



                                                56

instruments for nature conservation. In addition, it i s providing support for the establishment of
the Regional Environment Center, with the objective of providingtraining and capacity building
of civil society groups. Turkey-EU Environment Screening process has been completed and
report finalized on June 22,2007.
RISKSAND RISKMITIGATION
213.     Vulnerability to financial crises.     While risks remain, there has been significant
improvement inmany vulnerability indicators since the 2001crisis includingfor example that (a)
the cost of borrowing has been declining, (b) the annual inflation rate has declined sharply; (c)
the composition and maturity of public debt have improved; (d) debt managementpracticeshave
strengthened; (e) the public debt-to-GDP ratios have declined remarkably; and (f) the official
reserves of the CBRT rose substantially from around US$ 19 billion in 2001 to US$74 billion in
2007. Nevertheless, the large CAD, substantial external financing needs, a comparatively high
debt stock and relatively short maturities imply that the economy remains vulnerable to a
"sudden stop" infinancing.
214.     There have been a number of instances where changes in global risk appetite led to
volatility in Turkish markets over the last two years. Turkish markets recovered relatively
quickly from volatility in financial markets inMay-June 2006, February 2007, and April 2007 -
demonstrating economy's improved resilience to such shocks. Nevertheless, these events also
highlighted Turkey's continuing vulnerability to external and internal shocks as it was among the
hardest hit countries. Turkish markets have recently been affected by declining global risk
appetite due to developments originated in the US sub-prime mortgage market. The ISE index
has dropped by 20 percent between July 2007 and April 2008, and the yield on the YTL
denominated benchmark bond has increased from 17.5 to 18.8 despite a monetary easening of
225 basis points inthe same period. A change in global liquidity conditions and risk appetite for
emerging markets remains an important external risk factor. Under these circumstances, the
strength of economic fundamentals may play a key role in investment decisions of foreign
investors.
215.     Mitigating these risks requires maintaining the confidence of domestic and foreign
financial market participants. The EU accession process and the IMF-supported program have
acted as "twin anchors" for Turkey's economic policy. The possibility of a phasing out of the
IMF SBA in 2008, and of a slower EU accessionprocess, if realized, could weaken the anchors
of policy reform that untilnow helpedunderpineconomic policies.
216.     Turkey's substantial FX reserves and flexible exchange rate regime mitigate risks
associated with capital reversals. FX reserves of the CBRT increased from US$ 19 billion in
2001 to US$ 74 billion in 2007. Reserves represented 55 percent of gross external financing
requirements in 2006 and more than covered Turkey's short-term external debt as of September,
2007. Turkey's flexible exchange rate regime has helped cushion outflows during periods of
volatility. Systemic risks in the banking sector have been addressed, the state banks have been
re-capitalized, and the open FX position of the banking sector has moved close to balance.
CBRT independence and the regulatory bodies for banking, energy, telecommunications and
public procurement are increasing the effectiveness of economic management in line with
international and EUnorms. Fiscal adjustment has shifted the primary fiscal balance from deficit
to surplus and the legal framework for better fiscal management i s being gradually put inplace.


                                                 57

217.    Maintaining satisfactory macroeconomic performance and continuation o f structural
reforms will be the key to mitigating external financing risks. They will signal to market
participants that Turkish fundamentals are sound and thus mitigate the risks associated with large
external financing needs. Inits Action Plan dated January 10, 2008, the government reiterated its
firm commitment to maintaining strong fiscal discipline, inflation targeting, flexible exchange
rates, and overall macroeconomic stability, while deepening structural reforms, including
implementationo f the Social Security Reform.
218.    External factors. Although the resilience o f the economy has greatly improved, a key
challenge for Turkey will be coping with potentially volatile capital flows. Turkey remains
vulnerable to a sudden reversal in capital flows since, compared to other emerging economies, it
has a high total external debt. The mitigating factor for both EU accession risks and global
financing risk will be for the authorities to move forcefully on their program o f structural reforms
so as to convince markets that Turkish fundamentals are sound. Geo-political events in the
neighboring region may affect Turkey negatively through increased risk aversion by market
participants (Le., higher spreads) and oil prices - as the country i s a net energy importer and the
price o f energy affects the current account negatively.
219.    Banking Sector. The Turkish banking sector's exposure to foreign capital outflows is
mitigated by the fact that capital inflows in contrast to many other countries in the region have
not come through the banking system, but rather through the government securities market,
investmentsat the ISE, and more recently directly to the corporate sector inTurkey. The effects
on the banking sector would thus mostly be second order as liquidity in the money market and
government securities market would dry up if capital were to leave Turkey on a large scale. Since
2002, there has beena major shift in banking assets from government securities to private sector
credits. The source o f bank profits has shifted from trading and treasury revenue to profits from
net interest revenue in the loan and deposit business. The tighter fiscal policy, as well as
confidence in the ongoing reform process, has made the speculative trading business less
attractive inboth currency and interest rate positioning.
220.    The shift toward domestic credit would seem to have two positive benefits. The banking
system has become less susceptible to market risks that accompany international debt crises-
mainly rapidly rising real interest rates and falling exchange rates-and         financial deepening
improves the prospect for development. However, the change in bank portfolios has increased
the relative importance o f credit risk. The expansion o f the credit portfolio leaves the banking
system potentially vulnerable to a substantial increase in domestic interest rates because
borrowers may be unable to meet interest and principal payments at substantially higher rates.
Banks may also become vulnerable to the impact o f troubles in financial markets outside the
banking system duringdebt crises.
221.    Banks are using currency swaps to hedge any currency mismatch on their balance sheets
-which    means better management o f the associated risks. At the same time, these hedges allow
banks to create fixed interest rate local currency liabilities and thereby better manage the interest
rate risk from the growing mortgages in local currency. Non-Performing Loans (NPL) have
declined and loan provisions have grown leaving banks with very small net NPL ratios. This at a
time when the loan portfolio grew rapidly from US$38 billion in May 2003 to US$ 249 billion
inJanuary 2008.



                                                 58

222.    The regulatory and supervisory framework has been strengthened-although               some
weaknesses remain. The entry of foreign banks into the Turkish banking sector over the past few
years has contributed importantly to a more stable sector. Most private banks in Turkey have
gotten a foreign partner or have been acquired by foreign banks since the beginning of 2005.
Foreign owned banks are more likely to sustain access to international capital markets, and the
bigger international banks are more likely to be able to support the Turkish subsidiaries in cases
of distress.
223.    Despite increased resilience, the banking sector remains exposed to a reversal of capital
flows. Nonetheless, several factors mitigate the probability of a crisis. Turkey has experienced
the failure of a large bank without experiencing a systemic run. The inter-bank market i s very
small implying individual bank problems are unlikely to be transmitted to the system as a whole.
The Turkish financial system performed well under stress because, among other things, the
policies instituted by the CBRT since the 2001 crisis and thoughtful management of debt
maturity structure by the Treasury have provided financial market participants with the incentives
to makeprudent decisionsand given them the tools to execute these decisions.
224.    Political, legal and implementationrisks. Two major political risks are (1) increased
political uncertainty arising from the recent case filed with the Constitutional Court calling for
the dissolution of the rulingparty AKP; and (2) addressingborder tensions with Iraq. These risks
are very substantial, though not overwhelming. The recent lawsuit by the Turkey's Chief
Prosecutor with the Constitutional Court requesting the dissolution of the ruling party AKP and
other developments in the internal politics are likely to create non-negligible risks for reform
implementations. Turkey's consistent international outlook and continued orientation toward EU
accession, notwithstanding the ups and downs, have been and are expected to remain a major
unifying force behindpolitical and economic reforms.
225.    Public sector reform program faces legal, political and implementation risks that can
underminethe achievement of the goals of the program without necessarilytriggering a financial
crisis. Following a successful constitutional challenge to an earlier version of the Social Security
and UHILaw in 2006, there is a non-negligible risk that the recently approved revised law will
be challenged before the Constitutional Court again. The government has moved to make the
new law consistent with the Constitution but some risk of adverse ruling remains. Nonetheless,
the government has shown firm commitment to social security reform by amending the Law in
order to address the Court decision and by implementing the other dimensions o f the reform such
as unifying the previously existed three separate administrations for workers, civil servants and
self employed. The proposed program leaves time for constitutional review and finalization of
the necessary secondary legislation. Implementation of the law would be monitored under a
subsequent PPDPL 3.
226.    Implementation of major public reforms needs strong coordination and monitoring.
Public sector reforms, by the nature of the issues they address, tend to be cross-cutting and take
time to implement. A mitigating factor for the coordination risk is the increased reliance on EU
technical assistance. For example, the MOF has started to receive technical assistance from the
Netherlands MOF to assist with "secondary legislation regarding the budgetary process
(according to the Maastricht Criteria), the strengthening of the institutional framework for an
improved budget process and more efficient budget policy."



                                                59

227.     Social consensus on the reform program and sufficient institutional capacity are needed
for the implementation o f the reform program. The complexity and social impact o f many
elements o f the reform program, for example, the reform o f the social security system,
governance, and decentralization o f service delivery, requireconsensus building among the social
partners that takes time and inevitably results incompromises.
228.    The social security reform requires both strong institutions and close collaboration
amongst them for the reforms to be successful. Moreover, the introduction o f UHIalone without
the concurrent complementary reforms in strengthening the health referral system, rationalizing
pharmaceuticals procurement and providing more autonomy to hospitals to increase their
efficiency, could lead to the un-affordability o f UHIfrom a fiscal point o f view. Fortunately, the
government i s well aware o f these risks and i s from the beginning giving as much attention to
institutional issues as to the policy design itself. However, the experience o f increased health
expendituresin2005 and 2006 demonstrates the fiscal risks inherent inthe health system and the
need for the government to be both vigilant in monitoring such expenditures and in introducing
tougher administrative measures to control pharmaceutical expenditures.

Dear Mr.Zoellick,


1.      Our Government's commitment to sound economic policies and structural reforms has
resulted in a spectacular recovery after the 2001 crisis and people's lives have improved
significantly. Annual growth averaged 6.8 percent in the period 2002-2007. The outlook for
debt sustainability has improved, and inflation has seen an impressive decline through fiscal
discipline and tight monetary policy. Substantial progress has also been achieved in improving
public finances, reforming the public sector, restructuring the financial sector, and improving the
business environment.      Key markets have been liberalized and regulatory capacity in the
economy has been strengthened -including          banking supervision. Our future reform priorities
are contained in three key documents, namely the Ninth Development Plan (2007-2013), the
Government Action Plan, and the Program for Harmonizationwith EUacquis.
2.      This impressive economic performance is due first and foremost to credibleand sustained
stabilization, with strong fiscal discipline at its core, combined with an ongoing structural reform
agenda. IMF and the World Bank Group support as well as EU accessionnegotiations have also
contributed to successful implementation of the reform program.
3.      Turkey's key long-term development goals include strengthening human development
and social solidarity, ensuring regional development and increasing quality and efficiency in
public services. Inthis context, our aim is to sustain high growth and to further strengthen the
public sector by (a) maintaining an enabling macroeconomic framework, (b) reforming the
country's social protection system, (c) continuing the ongoing process of upgrading public
expenditure management and financial controls, and (d) improving the administration and
governance of the public sector.
4.      Our Government has implemented a number of key actions and i s ready to move ahead
with the rest of the Public Sector Reform Program. On this basis, we request World Bank
support for our Program by approving a SecondProgrammatic Public Sector Development Policy

                                                                                            Annex I
                                                                                         Page 2 of 8

Loan (PPDPL 2) and the disbursement of the EUR 255,400,000 (USD 400,000,000 equivalent).
We firmly believe that the reforms detailed inthis letter merit full support from the World Bank
and the international community.



I. SustaininganEnablingMacroeconomicFramework


5.       Over the last six years, Turkey has been experiencing strong growth. Inflationhas fallen
considerably, public debt sustainability has improved, and macroeconomic vulnerabilities have
significantly been reduced. Key elements contributing to this performance include a tight fiscal
and monetary policy, a flexible exchange rate, and structural reforms in the public and financial
sectors.
6.      The economy grew by 4.5 percent in 2007, down from an average of 7.2 percent in the
period of 2002-2006, due to deceleration of domestic demand, reflecting inpart elevated interest
rates and a weakening of net exports on the expenditure side; and drought-related shortfall of
agricultural production on the supply side. In2008, we expect growth to remain strong at about
4.5 percent. The disinflation process has slowed down inthe recent years due to commodity and
food price shocks. In 2008, we expect inflation to remain above the target as a consequence of
surging energy and food prices, and the recent depreciation of the YTL. However, we remain
committed to bringing inflation down to 4 percent inthe medium-termto lay the foundations for
sustained and high growth. The CAD-to-GDP ratio narrowed slightly to 5.7 percent in 2007
from 6.1 percent in2006. We expect the deficit to widen reaching around to 6.5 percent of GDP
in 2008 on the back of increasing energy and commodity prices.             The quality of external
financing has improved as the non-debt creating flows covered more than 50 percent of the CAD
in2007. Foreign direct investment is expectedto remainrobust in2008.
7.      Tight fiscal policy has been the cornerstone of our program, facilitating disinflation,
reducing real interest rates and leading to declining debt ratios. We are committed to cautious
fiscal stance in the period ahead. In 2007, a combination of higher than planned spending and
weaker than expected revenue caused by slowdown of economic activity has resultedin a lower
than targeted primary surplus. At this juncture, we view that a primary surplus of 5 percent is no
longer required for public debt sustainability as the net public debt-to-GDP ratio fell to 29.1
percent of GDP in 2007 from 66.5 percent in 2001. Hence, we expect public sector primary
surplus at 3.5 percent of GDP in2008.



11.      Social Security and Social Assistance Reform


8.      Our Government fully recognizes the importance of an effective and modern social
protection system. To this end, we have embarked on a comprehensive and challenging social
security reform consisting of four main pillars since 2004. The first pillar aims at establishing a
unique pension regime, which involves long and short term insurance programs except health
insurance. The second pillar supports the establishment of a universal healthinsurance to finance
a fair, preventive, treatment-oriented and high quality health service to the whole population. The

                                                                                               Annex I
                                                                                            Page 3 of 8

third pillar involves the unification o fthe currently diversified social assistance and services. The
fourth pillar aims at integrating the three separate social security institutions under a single
administration so as to provide social protection services in a facilitating and accessible as well
as effective manner to our citizens.
9.       In order to address the issue of sustainability of the pension system, we have prepared a
set o f legislations to overhaul the social security system and bring the system to balance in the
long term. There are two key pieces in the social security and universal health insurance reform
package, namely Social Security Institutional Law No. 5502 enacted on May 20, 2006 and Social
Security and Universal Health Insurance Law No. 5510 enacted on June 16, 2006. The Law No.
5510 reforming the pension parameters and creating legislative base for universal health
insurance was partly canceled by the Constitutional Court in December 2006 -mostly                 for
articles regulating civil servant pensions. Nevertheless, our Government has remained committed
to the social protection reform agenda and moved forward with the implementation o f the
administrative restructuring and certain parts o f universal health insurance reform. At the same
time, we have amended the Law No. 5510 by Law No. 5754 enacted on May 8,2008 in order to
address the Constitutional Court ruling. With a view to accommodate the Constitutional Court's
concerns, we have grandfathered existing civil servants but the new civil servants who would
enter into the system after the effectiveness o f the Law are included within the scope o f the
reform. We kept the essence o f the reform intact by bringingthe key pension parameters closer to
international norms -though     with a long transition period in the case o f retirement ages-     and
by substantially improving the long term fiscal sustainability o fthe pension system.We have also
ensured uniformity and equity inthe system by unifyingthe pensionparameters for all groups.
10.      We will start full implementation o f the amended Law No. 5510 as o f October 2008 in
order to allow time for the issuance o f secondary legislation requiredfor the implementation. We
are fully committed to the implementation o f the Law and we intendto address any challenges to
the Law or its implementation as they arise, withinthe spirit o fthe reform that we have embarked
on.



Parametric Pension Reform


11.      Our objectives under the parametric pension reform are to achieve fiscal sustainability,
uniformity and equity in the system. The parametric pension reform will result in substantial
fiscal savings inthe long run and will help move the Turkishpension system toward international
parameters. Within the context of this reform (i)retirement ages in Turkey are increased to
current international norms o f 65 for both men and women, albeit with a long transition period,
(ii) benefitaccrualrateisreducedclosertofiscallysustainableinternationalnorms, (iii)the
    the
revaluation of past earnings which had been set at growth o f nominal GDP for private sector
employees and the self-employed i s reduced to inflation plus 30 percent o f real GDP growth, and
(iv) the indexation of pensions post-retirement is linkedto inflation except for civil servants who
had already beeninthe system.

Administrative Dimensions of the Social Security System


12.      One o f the key goals o f our reform program was to tackle the previous fragmentation o f
the social security system. Our Government has made significant progress in the administrative
reform agenda. Implementation o f the Law No. 5502 reforming the administrative dimensions o f
social security by unifying then existing three social security schemes i s on track. Particularly,
our policy actions include (a) consolidating electronic records o f the previous social security
institutions and using an integrated identity number system, (b) establishing personnel policies
for the new social security institution and a core cadre o f staff, (c) establishing the financial
management and claims adjustment systems, and (d) harmonizing a unique positive drug list for
all participants in the new Social Security Institution. Inaddition, legislative changes have been
enacted that give the Social Security Institution the authority to develop and apply advance
screening such as proxy-means testing, in identifying the poorest for eligibility to non-
contributory health insurance.

UniversalHealth Insurance



13.      The Universal Health Insurance reform being implemented in Turkey today is a
fundamental structural reform, matched in importance and size by few other countries in the
world. Traditionally, health insurance system in Turkey was fragmented and inefficient with a
significant share o f population being uncovered, as coverage was linked to formal sector
workers. The Ministry o f Health provided services, mainly to the uncovered population through
the Green Card system. However, due to lack o f an integrated system, large numbersof formally
non-eligible individuals were able to obtain services. Overall health costs o f the system were
rising, attributable to expanded access to outpatient health services in the absence o f a
strengthened primary health care system, absence o f a referral system, and lack o f demand side
controls. With the introduction o f Universal Health Insurance, we aimed at, among other things,
improving access to quality health services by the poor, improving efficiency o f the health
system, and effectively regulating access to health insurance.
14.      In this context, our Government has taken the following policy actions for a successful
implementation o f Universal Health Insurance; (a) establishment o f an expenditure tracking
system for pharmaceuticals, and (b) adoption o f tight global budget caps for state hospitals' 2008
budgetson a quarterly basis.



111.     PublicFinancialand ExpenditureManagementReform


15.      The enactment of the Public Financial Management and Control (PFMC) Law No. 5018
in 2003 has provided a new legal framework for modern public expenditure management and
accountability. Our Government i s committed to satisfactory implementation o f this landmark
PFMC Law. The underlying objectives o f the PFMC Law are to improve the quality o f the
public service delivery, enhance the functioning o f the government, and increase accountability
and transparency inthe public sector. With this Law ,we have introduced strategic management

                                                                                              Annex I
                                                                                           Page 5 of 8

concept through linking plans and policies with the budgets, initiating institutional strategic plans
and performance budgets, and introducing medium term fiscal framework in the budgeting
process.
16.     Our Government has issued all required secondary legislations for the implementation of
the PFMC Law. Inthis regard, a total of 47 secondary legislations inthe form of regulationand
communiqu6 have been issued and become effective. Among these secondary legislations, the
critical ones are; (a) rules and procedures o f strategic planning in the public administrations, (b)
rules and procedures of internal control, (c) public sector internal control standards, (d) financial
services experts regulation, (e) rules and working principles o f the strategy developmentunits, (f)
rules and working principles o f internal auditors, and (g) internal audit strategy paper.
17.     Establishing a well functioning internal audit structure i s crucial for the successful
implementation o f the PFMC Law.          Developing internal audit capacity i s still an ongoing
process. So far, more than 374 appointed internal auditors in the general government have been
trained on internal auditing standards and implementations under the new PFMC system, and
have beencertified.
18.     Inline with the strategic management concept, we have established strategy development
units -which    are essential for the successful implementation o f the PFMC Law-          and these
units are fully operational inall general government institutions. Strategy development units are
responsible for strategic planning, budgeting, accounting and internal control functions.
19.     Our Government also recognizes the need for aligning budgetary process with
international practices. In this context, using accrual accounting in fiscal accounts i s o f critical
importance particularly for macroeconomic policy. Its importance arises from the fact that it
measures assets and liabilities that are relevant to the overall stance o f fiscal policy and fiscal
sustainability, but which are not measured by cash accounting.          After initiating the accrual
accounting inthe central government in 2006, the Ministry of Finance started collecting the local
administrations' financial data on an accrual basis consistent with the rest o f the general
government. The Ministry o f Finance incorporated electronically quarterly trial balance o f all
local administrations into the Say2000i accounting system. Through this development, the
consolidated local administrations balance sheet was generated by the Ministry o f Finance on an
accrual basis for 2006. As a result, 2006 financial statements o f central government institutions
and local administrations have beenprepared on an accrual basis.
20.     As part o f our efforts to enhance fiscal transparency and accountability, our Government
published a complete list o f tax expenditures, which defines 87 articles or sub-articles as tax
expenditures and provides an estimate o ftax expenditures for 2007.
21.     Our Government i s aware that ensuring sufficient resources for high quality public
investmentprojects remains a key challenge inTurkey, despite some success inrationalization o f
the Public Investment Program (PIP) in the recent years. In our Annual Programs, we have
recognizedthe expected expenditure pressure on the PIP o f an acceleration o f the alignment with
the EU. Our 2008 Program reiterates two major problems in the PIP; first, lack o f adequate
resource allocation to current investment needs, and second inefficiencies in using these
allocations. In order to improve the link between the resource allocation process and actual
investment needs (particularly new investment needs that may arise due to the EU alignment
process), we have (a) initiated a study on assessment of the actual needs for maintenance

                                                                                             Annex I
                                                                                           Page 6 of 8

expenditure, and (b) identified five pilot public institutions for establishing an Operations and
Maintenance Framework.



IV.      Public Administrationand GovernanceReform


Improving the Justice System


22.      Legal and judicial reform has become a significant topic since Turkey's official
application for EU membership in 1999. Since that time, we have embarked on legal reform
efforts focused on constitutional and legal changes intendedto strengthendemocracy, the rule o f
law and the protection o f human rights. As a result o f these efforts, Turkey now performs very
well in comparison with EU and EU accession members along various dimensions measured by
surveys such as the 2005 Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS)
and 2006 Doing Business.
23.      Despite the gains, Turkish courts continue to face backlogs and delays. In order to
improve the justice system and ease the backlog o f cases, we have enacted a law for the
establishment o f Regional Courts o f Appeals, which i s now effective. The establishment o f the
Regional Courts o f Appeals i s an important step aimed at easing the case load o f the Courts o f
Appeals as well as allowing the Supreme Court to reduce its caseload and play a guiding role for
thejudicial system. We expect the courts to be operational inlate 2009 or early 2010 as Ministry
o f Justice needs to identify and appoint judges and staff to these courts. We have also established
online connections among courts through satisfactory implementation o f the National Judicial
Network Project (UYAP). More than 90 percent o f courthouses are connected to the system. Our
government has also expanded training programs for judges and prosecutors through the National
Justice Academy which has assumed all the mandatory pre-service training for candidate judges
and prosecutors. Inaddition, we have improved the delivery o f the in-service training programs.



Decentralization


24.      We are aware that the Turkish public sector i s highly centralized with central government
accounting for about 90 percent o f general government expenditures. Therefore, we have
embarked on a gradual process o f decentralization. At the same time, we are also aware that
successful decentralization will require improvements in the technical capacity o f local
administrations and improvements in local accountability and that any decentralization o f
expenditure responsibilities must be matched by a corresponding adjustment inrevenues. In this
context, we are committed to satisfactory implementation o f the Metropolitan Municipalities
Law, the Special Provincial Administrations Law and the Municipalities Law. So far, we have
completed the secondary legislation required for the implementation o f these laws. In 2007, we
issued 5 implementing circulars including (a) norm cadre principles and standards for
municipalities, municipal enterprises, local administration service unions and special provincial

                                                                                           Annex I
                                                                                        Page7 of 8

administrations, (b) procurement o f rural services, and (c) recruitment procedures for local
administrations staff.
25.     Our Government also prepared and submitted to the Parliament a draft law on Special
Provincial Administration and Municipality Revenues on September 26, 2006.            The current
version would make two major changes in the existing structure of local administrations'
revenues. First, it would increase the overall volume o f central government transfers by
expanding the definition o f central government taxes subject to sharing. Second, it would change
the distribution o f revenue sharing among categories of local administrations and would
introduce two new criteria into the distribution o f these shares. These would include indicators
o f poverty (such as a provincial development index) and a performance index.
26.     We are also taking measures to reinin fiscal risks o f decentralization. The Municipalities
Law limits the total stock o f municipal debt. The Law No. 6183 on Public Receivables and the
Law No. 4749 on Public Finance and Debt Management permit the Government to deduct debt
service owed by local administrations to the Treasury and other public entities from
intergovernmental transfers. The draft Special Provincial Administration and Municipality
Revenues Law would facilitate that process by permitting the Government (via Iller Bank) to
deduct up to 40% o f local administration transfers for this purpose. Law No. 4749 and its
secondary legislation as well as annual Budget Laws set limits for municipal external borrowing
under Treasury guarantees. In addition, the PFMC Law requires local administrations to submit
periodic financial reports to the government, enabling the government to better monitor their
financial condition. The General Directorate of Local Administrations within the Ministry o f
Interior has published for the first time in 2007 the general activity report for local
administrations, in accordance with the PFMC Law. The report aims to shed light on budget
outcomes and levels o f indebtedness, human resources, physical capital and investments o f
special provincial administrations, municipalities and local administration unions.



Regional Development


27.     Regional development i s one o f our key policy challenges, especially in light o f our
objectives to achieve more equitable economic development and to reduce income disparities
across regions, with the ultimate aim o f convergence with the EU average income. Indeed,
regional development i s one o f the five development axes identified in Turkey's Ninth
Development Plan.       Our 2008 Annual Program provides the policy framework for four
components under the regional development axis, namely (a) increasing the effectiveness of
regional development policies at the central level, (b) achieving development based on local
dynamics, (c) improving institutional capacity at the local level, and (d) promoting rural
development.
28.     In 2006, we announced our intention to create Development Agencies (DAs) in the
country's 26 NUTS-2regions. These would operate largely in a planning and coordination role,
supporting implementationo f regional plans and programs and coordinating activities of sectoral
ministries and local units of government. In this context, we enacted a law authorizing the
establishment o f DAs, which became effective in February 2006. The law outlines the duties,

                                                                                            Annex I
                                                                                         Page 8 of 8

powers and organizational structure of the agencies and requires the establishment of DAs inthe
26 NUTS-2 regions. We have made substantial progress on this ground and established DAs in
two NUTS-2 regions by the Council of Ministers Decree dated July 2006, one of which i s for
Adana and Mersin provinces and the other for Izmir province.            Both DAs have become
operational and have initiated work on identifyingtheir short term "pre-development strategies".
InJuly and September 2006, we issuedregulations on (a) personnelpolicy and management, (b)
working principles of the DAs, and (c) budget and accounting principles. Finally, at the end of
2006, we completed examinations for recruitment of personnelfor bothDAs.
29.     The process of establishing DAs was temporarily halted in 2007 due to a challenge to
their constitutionality. While the Constitutional Court's decision, rendered in November 2007,
annulled certain provisions affecting the appointment of staff and tax exemptions, it left the
remainder of the D A Law intact, enabling the government to establish new DAs and permitting
the existing agencies to fully operate. Currently, the law on the establishment of DAs is being
implementedsatisfactorily.
30.     Inaddition to progress inestablishing the DAs structure to promote institutional capacity
at the regional level, we identified, based on both qualitative and quantitative indicators, fifteen
"growth poles" in regions where both intra and interregional convergence need i s higher. We
have created the legal base for budgetary allocation for at least one pilot implementation of the
growth poles program in order to promote institutional capacity building and human resources.
Our government has also taken steps to ensure the effective absorption of EU funds. In2006, the
Prime Ministry issued a circular setting out the framework for monitoring three EU-supported
regional development programs. In 2007, the Government prepared a "Strategic Coherence
Framework" which provides a general framework for the operational programmes under the
regional development and human resources development components of IPA.


31.     We are committed to maintaining the macroeconomic stability and fiscal discipline. We
believe that the policies and actions describedinthis letter are adequate to achieve the objectives
of the public sector reform program. We have taken all the agreed actions under PPDPL 2. We
also stand ready to take additional measures, if necessary, to ensure the continuation and success
of the reform program supportedby the PPDPL program.


                                                            Yours sincerely,

                         ANNEX111:THEWORLDBANK-IMFRELATIONS

1.       The World Bank and IMF teams have worked in close collaboration in Turkey, and
standard working arrangements broadly follow the guidelines for enhanced Bank-Fund
collaboration. The IMF has taken the lead in macroeconomic stabilization and the World Bank
in social and structural areas, with close collaboration in structural areas that have a particular
impact on macroeconomic stability.

Background

2.       After the collapse of the 2000 exchange rate-based disinflation program and the floating
o f lira in February 2001, the banking system experienced heavy losses, inflation soared and the
economy contracted by nearly 10 percent. Public debt climbed to over 90 percent o f GNP (old
series) in 2001, partly owing to the costs o f bank restructuring. After the crisis, the Turkish
government introduced a three-year economic program backed by a SBA with the IMF and series
o f programmatic loans from the Bank and since then, strong fiscal consolidation and disinflation
efforts have laidthe basis for a rapid and powerful recovery.
3.       Turkey concluded the last Fund-supported program covering the period o f 2005-2008
successfully. The reforms have delivered a decisive break with Turkey's history of high and
variable inflation, and low and volatile growth.
4.       Leaving the favorable developments aside, the Turkish economy faces a number o f risks
as well. The strong economic recovery, the appreciation o f YTL and rising oil prices have also
led to widening CAD which continue to remain a source o f concern. The high size o f the
government debt, its short maturity, and its currency composition i s also a major source of
vulnerability. For the mediumterm, the authorities' main challenge i s to implement policies that
achieve the goals o f sustained growth and low inflation. With the start o f the EU accession
negotiations, the alignment with the EU Acquis Communitaire and rapid income convergence to
the EUaverages now constitute further challenges.

The SBA for Turkey (2005-2008)

5.       The Executive Board o f the IMF approved a three-year, SDR 6.66 billion (approximately
US$ 10.8 billion) SBA inMay 2005 to support Turkey'seconomic and financial program through
May 2008.
6.       The overriding goals of the program were to create conditions for sustained growth that
will raise living standards and reduce unemployment; facilitate convergence towards the EU
economies; and bring about an orderly exit from Fund support. To achieve this, the program
aimed to:

         0   Deal effectively with short-term macroeconomic challenges and, inparticular, reduce
            the CAD to more sustainable levels.


         0   Secure permanently lower inflation, by retaining the floating exchange rate,
            preserving CBRT independence under formal inflation targeting.

                                                                                           Annex I11
                                                                                          Page 2 of 4


        0   Further improve the government debt position through continued sizable primary
            surpluses, shifting towards longer debt maturities, and underpinning the fiscal
            adjustment with structural fiscal reforms.


        0   Improve Turkey's net FX reserve position and strengthen its resilience to unexpected
            external developments.

        0   Maintain financial sector stability by further improving the supervisory and regulatory
            framework, accelerating asset recovery and privatization o f state banks.


        0   Implement a structural reform agenda that enhances Turkey's growth prospects,
            lowers unemployment, and improves the investmentclimate.

7.      The program's macroeconomic framework was centered on achieving high and sustained
growth o f around 5 percent each year. Inflation was targeted at single digits for 2006, declining
to the low single digits by the end o f the program.
8.      Growth has moderated in line with program assumptions, inflation i s in single digits, and
the public debt burden is being reduced steadily.             The authorities' adherence to prudent
macroeconomic policies has played a key role in supporting these developments.            The main
challenge to the economic outlook i s the large CAD, which has beendriven by increasing energy
and commodity prices and strengthening of YTL. The authorities' response to the current
account developments-strong        budgets, tight monetary policy with explicit inflation targeting,
and accelerated reserve accumulation-has        beenappropriate. The CBRT's cautious approach to
interest rate cuts i s appropriate given still challenging inflation outlook in2008.

Areas inwhich the World Bank leads

9.      The Bank has taken the lead instructural areas where both institutions have conditionality
including bankruptcy reform, corporate sector restructuring, social security reform, regulatory
and market reforms in telecommunications and energy, agriculture reform, and privatization.
The Bank i s also in the lead in areas such as health, education, infrastructure, governance and
environmental management.

Areas in which the Fund leads

10.     The Fund takes the lead in macroeconomic stabilization including macro-fiscal policy,
monetary policy, exchange rate policy and financial stability and risk management.

Areas of shared responsibility

11.     The work on public sector management and governance has focused on strengthening
PEM system while maintaining fiscal discipline. The Fund has taken the lead in the short-term
measures needed for the fiscal adjustment such as incomes policy, urgent revenue and
expenditure measures, and budget monitoring and reporting. The Bank has taken the lead in
assisting government on the medium-term P E M strategy, rationalization o f the PIP, public
procurement reform, accounting reform, and public liability management. Public employment

                                                                                        Annex I11
                                                                                       Page 3 of 4

policy, medium-term tax strategy, anti-conuption strategy and civil service reform are further
areas o f Bank involvement.
12.     The challenge facing Turkey inthe financial sector has been to address the banking crisis
and putting inplace an appropriate legal and regulatory framework that would minimize the risk
o f future crises. The Bank has taken the lead in reform o f the legal framework and regulations
for bank supervision, the institutional development o f the Banking Regulation and Supervision
Agency (BRSA) and SDIF, and the structural reforms required to guide the restructuring and
improve the governance o f the state banks, as well as work on Non-Bank Financial Institutions
(NBFI). The Fund has taken the lead in assessing the soundness of the banking system and
where there was an immediate fiscal impact such as the re-capitalization o f the state banks, the
closing o f insolvent banks, and the private bank recapitalization scheme. On the state banks
agenda and resolution o f private banks the Fund and Bank have worked closely as a team. The
Bank intends to continue its support for financial sector reform in Turkey including the
development o f the NBFIfor which a major study has recently beenconcluded.

Current Status of the IMF SBA

13.     As o f May 9, 2008, the IMF Board approved the completion of the seventh and final
review o f the SBA and the disbursement o f the remaining SDR 2.25 billion (approximately US$
3.6 billion) thus, the full amount envisaged under the SBA (SDR 6.66 billion) was disbursed.
Consequently, the three- year SBA has been successfully completed. The following i s the press
release by the IMF on the completion o f the seventhand final review discussionsof the SBA.

IMFExecutiveBoardCompletes Seventh and FinalReviewUnderthe Stand-By
Arrangementfor Turkey and Approves USS3.65 BillionDisbursement

                              Press Release No. 08/106, May 9,2008

The Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund(IMF) today completed the seventhand
final review under the three-year SDR 6.66 billion (about US$10.8 billion) Stand-By
Arrangement for Turkey, which was approved on May 11, 2005 (see Press Release No. 051104).
The completion o f this review enables Turkey to draw immediately the remainingbalance under
the arrangement, equivalent to SDR 2.25 billion (about US$3.65 billion).

The Board also approved Turkey's request for waivers of non-observance of the end-December
2007 quantitative performance criteria in the fiscal area (primary balances o f the consolidated
government sector including and excluding state economic enterprises, overall balance o f the
social security institutions, and consolidated primary spending o f the central government and
social security institutions).

At the conclusion of the Executive Board's discussion on Turkey, Mr.Dominique Strauss-Kahn,
Managing Director andChairman, stated:

"The Turkish economy has continued to perform reasonably well despite a challenging external
environment, with economic activity showing resilience and FDI inflows remaining buoyant.

                                                                                           Page 4 of 4

However, supply shocks have raised inflation, and turbulence in global credit markets has
heightenedTurkey's external financing risks. Recent domestic political developments have also
weighed on investor sentiment. In response to these external and domestic developments,
Turkishfinancial markets recently unwound some of last year's large gains.

"The authorities have responded to these challenges by taking important steps to bring their
economic program back on track. Adoption o f the social security reform i s a major achievement
that will contribute to the long-run sustainability o f public finances. Recent actions to strengthen
tax administration, reform the energy sector, and enhance bank prudential requirements are also
welcome.

"Short-run macroeconomic policies will need to balance carefully the desire to support growth
with the needto contain inflation and the CAD. From this perspective, it will be essential that the
authorities adhere closely to their updated plans for this year to target an unchanged primary
surplus relative to 2007 of at least 3% percent of GDP. This revised target creates room to
decompress infrastructure spending and bring forward a worthy but costly cut in labor taxes. New
initiatives that further erode the structural fiscal position should be resisted to preserve the
downward path o f public debt and avoid further unwarranted pressure on monetary policy to
stem inflationary pressures. From this perspective, it is important to make the envisaged reform
o f subnational governments' finances fiscally neutral.

"The central bank has revisedupwards its inflation forecasts in response to a series o f shocks to
food and energy prices as well as a weakening in the lira, while reaffirming its medium-term
target o f 4 percent. It has also appropriately adopted a tighteningbias. Entrenching the credibility
o f the inflation targeting regime requires that the central bank respond promptly to broadening
price pressures by tightening monetary policy and avoid lifting prematurely its tightening bias
once inflation i s back on a declining path.

"To anchor fiscal policy expectations, the authorities have announced a new medium-term fiscal
framework that aims to cut gross public debt by some 10 percentage points o f GDP within five
years. This objective i s underpinned by a policy commitment on the primary surplus, which i s
targeted to decline from 3 percent o f GDP in 2009 to 2% percent o f GDP in 2012. Achieving
these targets will require continued efforts to enhance revenue collection and significant
discipline in restraining current spending. The authorities are encouraged to formalize their
medium-termfiscal framework by adopting an explicit fiscal rule.

"Turkey has achieved considerable success by adhering to the Fund-supported program that is
now drawing to a close. Looking ahead, Turkey's challenge will be to press forward on the
reform path to further entrench macroeconomic stability and decisively lift potential growth to
facilitate convergence toward EU income levels," Mr.Strauss-Kahn said.

Strengthening Human Development and Social Solidarity
1.     The main purpose o f the policies inthe area o f human development and social solidarity
will be to raise the quality of life and welfare of the society by ensuring that all segments of the
population benefit sufficiently from the basic public services as well as a multi-dimensional
social protection network. While the main policies o f priority are education and health for the
provision o f basic public services; as for the development o f social protection network, they will
be setting up policies for an inclusive and sustainable health and social security system,
increasing efficiency o f social services, improving income distribution, social inclusion and
fighting poverty, protecting and strengtheningculture, and developing social dialogue
Improving Health Services
       The UHIsystem will be implementedto facilitate accessto health services.
       The family medicine service model will be spread to all provinces by the endof 2008
       Inorder to make the operation ofhospitals more efficient and improve the quality oftheir
       services, hospitals will be gradually made autonomous in financial and administrative
       terms.
       With the aim o f increasing service quality, national standards concerning service
       provision and personnel will be determinedand the system for the accreditation o f health
       institutions will be established.
       The planning, regulatory and supervisory role o fthe M O H will be strengthened.
       With the efficient operation o f the referral system and widespread use o f information
       systems, provision o f services at hospitals will be facilitated and monitoring o f health
       expenditureswill be ensured.
       Mechanisms will be established to control the quality and use o f pharmaceuticals and
       medical devices as well as the effectiveness o f these expenditures.
Increasing Effectiveness of the Social Security System
       The social security system will be provided with a structure, which will cover the entire
       population, can meet the changing needs o f the society, have financial sustainability, and
       provide good quality services.
       The social insurance system will be extended in a way to cover the entire working
       population and informal employment will be prevented.
       Financial sustainability o f the social security system will be achieved considering the
       actuarial balances. A structure, which will prevent loss o f rights and repeated benefits and
       provide effective, accessible and sustainable services, will be established through
       transition to full automation in the information processing infrastructure o f the social
       security system.

                                                                                            Annex V
                                                                                          Page 2 of 6

       The principles of equality, social justice, efficiency and effectiveness will be the basis o f
       the social services and assistance system. A common database will be set up in order to
       determine the individuals that will benefit from the system, and an objectively operating
       detection mechanism will be established.
       The shortage of qualified personnel in the area o f social services and assistance will be
       eliminated and the qualifications o f the existingpersonnel will be improved.
Ensuring Regional Development
2.     Regional development policies will contribute to national development, competitiveness
and employment by increasing productivity o f regions on the one hand, and they will serve the
basic objective o f reducing regional and rural-urban disparities on the other hand.
3.     In this context; emphasis will be placed on activities towards increasing the consistency
and effectiveness of policies at the central level, creating a development environment based on
local dynamics and internal potential, increasing institutional capacity at the local level and
accelerating rural development.
Making Regional Development Policy Effective at the Central Level
       The planning tools and standards at the national, regional and local levels o f planning
       hierarchy will be identified and the consistency of plans will be ensured. An integrated
       system for the management and supervision o f plans, including the physical plans, taking
       the management onthe spot principle as the basis will be formed.

   0   A regional development strategy at national level will be prepared to provide coordination
       in regional development and to constitute a general framework for sublevel plans and
       strategies to be prepared.

                ANNEXVI: SUMMARYNOTEONTHELATESTGDPREVISION

1.      On March 8, 2008, TURKSTAT introduced a fourth revision to Turkey's GDP series and
updated the base year to 1998 from 1987. TURKSTAT has been compiling national accounts
data since 1929. GDP usingthe production and expenditure approaches has beenestimated both
innominal and realterms based onthe concepts ofthe 1968 System ofNational Accounts (SNA)
since 1972. The data have been published at a quarterly frequency since 1987. The national
income accounts data from 1923 onwards were revisedbased on data in 1948, 1968 and 1987.
2.      The main reason for the latest revision was to reflect structural changes in the economy
since 1987 in national accounts statistics. Another reason was to harmonize Turkey's GDP
estimates with the ESA 95. This work was initiated in 2004 and completed in March, 2008.
TURKSTAT plans to complete full alignment with the ESA 95 by 2011.
3.      With this revision, the authorities aimed at (a) improving the measurement of Turkey's
economic activities; (b) enhancing international comparability o f Turkey's statistics; and (c)
meetingdata requirementsof international institutions.
4.      The new series embody improvements in both methodology - such as introduction o f the
benchmarking system, changes in the measurement o f financial intermediation services,
introduction o f chain index method - and coverage - such as inclusion o f some additional
sectors: leasing, factoring, private pension funds and non-profit financial intermediation, to name
a few. The historical revision i s also due to improvements in data sources and statistical
techniques. This revision has brought significant changes to GDP series both inreal and nominal
terms for the last nine years, as well as for the first three quarters o f 2007 (Table Al). The
revised series maintain the trend o f real GDP growth but adjust nominal GDP levels upwards by
about 32 percent on average.

5.      The recent revision to national income data has resulted in significant changes in
Turkey's key macroeconomic indicators - although their trends have remained broadly
unchanged (Table A2). For instance, the revised GDP data also show that the CAD-to-GDP ratio

                                                                                                                            Annex VI
                                                                                                                          Page 2 of 2

increasedsubstantially,while the public debt-to-GDPratiowas on a sharplydecliningpathinthe
period 2002-2006. Nevertheless, with the revision, shares of expenditure components in GDP
have changed considerably. To illustrate, the revised data show an increase in the domestic
savings-to-GDPratio in 2006 - comparedto a 1.5 percentagepoint of GDP decline implied by
the old series. A similar differencecan also be observedinthe gross investment-to-GDPratio in
2006.

                            ANNEXVII: PENSIONREFORMSTURKEY    IN

1.       Pension reform in Turkey has been a long process, beginning from a removal of the
minimum retirement age in 1991, which resulted in the most generous eligibility conditions in
the world. The movement back toward internationally acceptedparametershas required multiple
steps as would be expected for a politically difficult reform where the parameters were greatly
out of line with international best practice.
2.       The 1999 reform introduced a minimumretirementage for workers, but beginning at the
very young ages of 38 for women and 43 for men, culminating in a retirement age of 58 for
women and 60 for men applicable to those joining the social security system for the first time
after the reform was legislated. O f the four schemes targeted at different types of workers, the
benefit determination for two of them, private sector employees and the self-employed, were
harmonized, while the benefits provided to the other two groups, civil servants and farmers
remained unreformed. The key parameters in the harmonized schemes including a relatively
high 35 percent benefit provided for the first 10 years of contributions, followed by a lower
annual accrual rate of 2 percent per year for the next 15 years and 1.5 percent per year
subsequently. The incentives in such a system clearly encourage shorter contribution histories in
that the first years of contributions generate proportionally higher pensions than additional years.
Furthermore, while the salary base on which the pension is based was to be gradually increased
to lifetime average salary from the previous 3 or 5 year average, the previous salaries were
revalued using the growth rate of nominal GDP. The revaluation parameter, which typically is
linked to the growth of average nominal wage, was chosen in the absence of a well accepted
wage series in Turkey, but resulted in a generous revaluation, ranging from 33 percent to 70
percent higher than international best practice would suggest. Indexation post-retirement was
also linked exclusively to inflation although after the first two years, the Government typically
provided higher pension increases than inflation and best practice would suggest. Finally, the
number of contributing days was gradually raised from 5000 to 7000, or from 14 years to 20
years, for a full pensionwith reducedpensions available for those with as few as 10years.
3.      In the initial years of the 1999 reform, the fiscal balance of the pension funds markedly
improved, but beganto deteriorate again in2002, with the largest growth inexpenditures coming
from the relatively unreformed civil servant system. The Government in response drafted new
legislation, the original Law No. 5510, which was passed by Parliament inMay 2006. This Law
unified the benefit structure for all workers inTurkey and raisedretirement ages for new entrants
gradually to 65 for both men and women. The pension would be calculated as 2.5 percent of
salary for each year of contribution until 2015 and 2 percent per year thereafter, of the average
salary, gradually phasing from the existing averaging period to lifetime average. Previous
salaries were to be revalued by 50 percent of inflation and 50 percent of nominal wage growth,
and pensions would be indexed by inflation only after retirement. The contribution period would
gradually increase to 9000 days from the previous 7,000 days. But all contributions paidprior to
the reform would be credited using the pre-reform benefit formula, and only the post-reform
contributions would be calculated using the new formulas.
4.      This Law was initially vetoed by the President, resubmitted to Parliament, and then
approved by the President, who turned it over to the Constitutional Court for a ruling. The
Constitutional Court declared key parts of the Law unconstitutional.           After elections, the

                                                                                         Annex VI1
                                                                                        Page 2 of 4

Government chose to amend the Law to address the issues raised by the ConstitutionalCourt.
Specifically, the Court raised the issue of the lack of a reliable wage series in Turkey and the
wish to see economic growth included in the revaluation parameter. The Government has
responded by changing the revaluationparameter to 100 percent of inflation and 30 percent of
real GDP growth. The Court also raised the issue of maintaining a separate system for civil
servants and indexing civil servant pensions to salary growth of current civil servants, but
tempered this ruling by also suggesting that the system would need to be fiscally sustainable.
The Government has chosen to grandfather the existing civil servants under their separate
system, but to changethe parametersapplyingto new civil servantsto bringthem inline with the
pensionparametersappliedto all other workers inTurkey. All of the parametersof the new and
old lawsare showninTable A3.
5.     In response to severe strikes by labor unions in March 2008, the Government also has
allowedexistingprivate sector workers to earn an accrual rate of 3 percentfor their first 10years,
and all private sector workers, new and existing, to retire at full pension with only 20 years of
contributions.
6.     The Government added a coupleof additionalmeasures. One establisheda minimumold
age pensionof 35 percent of minimum wage for pensionerswithout dependents, and 40 percent
of minimum wage for pensionerswith dependents. The other exemptedall workers earning less
than the legal minimum wage from paying contributions. This latter measure may have been
recognitionthat collecting contributions at minimum wage from workers who contribute at less
than half minimum wage would have been difficult, even not impossible. Nevertheless, these
workers who previouslycontributedfor healthbenefitswill receive at least a partialsubsidy from
Government for healthinsurance and will no longer receiveanything, but the means-testedsocial
pensioninold age.
7.     The fiscal implicationsof the new Law relativeto the current system are shown inFigure
A1 under the assumptionthat no behavioral changes take place. Clearly, there are major fiscal
improvementsboth inthe medium and longterm from undertakingthese reforms. There is still
some risk that the constitutional court will not accept the unified parameters for new civil
servants in addition to their concerns over existing civil servants. But even in this case, the
reformsare a substantial improvementover the current systemalthoughthe longterm deficit will
remaintoo highto be permanentlysustainableinthis case.
8.     However, it should be noted that the parameters chosen might entice some workers and
employers to respond by reducing their contribution period and reducing it to the minimum
required years prior to retirement. The particular problematic parameters are the level of the
minimumpensionand the revaluationof past wages. The minimumpensionis set at 35 percent
of minimum wage for all pensioners,whether basedon partialwork history or full work history.
For minimum wage workers with the minimum contributionperiod of 15 years, the benefit rate
would only be 30 percent of minimum wage if the past wages had been revalued in line with
average wage growth. Since they are revalued only approximately with 40 percent of average
wage growth, there will be a substantial subsidy to these workers from the minimum pension.
Shouldworkers respondto this incentive, the revenuesshown inFigure A1 will be lower as will
expenditures inthe longerrun.

          ANNEXVIIk POVERTY AND DISTRIBUTIONAL           IMPACTS OF PPDPLREFORMS

 1.      The actions and reforms supported under this PPDPL 2 program are expected to have,
overall, positive distributional and poverty impacts in Turkey. Ina broader context, the program
aims to contribute to macroeconomic stability by maintaining an enabling macroeconomic
environment and by improving fiscal sustainability o f the social security system-ultimately
creating fiscal space for growth enhancing expenditures. The recent past provides evidence o f
how effective a sustained high growth could be in reducing poverty as about 7 million people
were pulled out of poverty since 2003. In a more specific context, several o f the actions
supported under the program are expected to have direct positive impacts, most importantly the
implementation of the UHI. Several others, including the pension reform under the revised
Social Security and UHI Law, are expected to have more indirect, albeit important, positive
impacts.
2.       UHI component of revised Social Security and UHI Law No. 5510: expected direct
positive distributional and poverty impacts if coverage expansion and exemptions are realized as
planned.     First, Government plans to extend free formal health insurance coverage (with
premiums paid for by Treasury) to all those falling below a specific level of per capita income
(1/3 o f per capita gross minimumwage which is relatively close, albeit slightly above, the current
per capita poverty line for an average family). Today's effective free health insurance coverage
through the Green Card system reaches about 9 million households but undercoverage o f the
poorest two deciles remains important - the estimated effective coverage rate o f the poorest
decile i s 54 percent, o f the second poorest decile 34 percent. The actions supported through
PPDPL 2 include authorizing SSI to develop and apply advance screening methods to reach these
beneficiaries and extend the effective coverage o f the poor. Second, the Law also introduces
several partial premium subsidies for today's uncovered population that do not qualify for free
coverage but are unable to pay full premiumpayments.
3.       The realization o f such potential positive impacts will depend on a number of factors,
however. First, the design and implementationo f the exemption policy during the next two years
will be core to extending effective financial protection to all the poor. Direct means testing
(income or consumption assessment) i s not being used in Turkey today given the large share o f
the working population in the informal sector (around half) as well as existing local
administrative capacities. But Turkey does have positive experiences with the application o f
proxy means testing under the conditional cash transfer program which reaches 2.6 million
beneficiaries.   The extension (and implementation at the local level) for such testing to an
additional 10 million people (or roughly 2.5 million households) which are, according to the
administrative data, not covered today, will require a substantial administrative effort and
capacity building - only than will the exemption policy reach the poor effectively. Second,
complementary to the reach o f the poor and vulnerable i s an effective delivery o f a package o f
health services covered by the insurance. Given that private service providers will be able to
charge co-payments (with the specific level to be determinedby the Council o f Ministers), most
o f the poorer population will continue to seek care through public providers. The setting of
incentives through relative provider prices as well as the human resources policy in the public
sector will be key to ensuring continued good quality public provider care. Third, the success o f

protection for the poor - will also depend on an overall containment o f health costs which have

risen fast in the past years. An unsustainable increase o f overall health expenditures could both
underminethe implementation of the reform itself as well as the effective implementation o f the
exemption policy.
4.       Pension component o f revised Social Security and UHI Law; potential indirect positive
distributional and poverty impacts. The pension reforms o f the revised Social Security and UHI
Law are geared to make the system fiscally sustainable as well as to improve horizontal equity.
Few o ftoday's poor are contributing to the formal pension system so the benefitsfrom increasing
the likelihood o f pensionpayments inthe future (given that the system becomes sustainable) are
relatively small. However, potential indirect positive impacts could be realized. First, over the
medium-run, the parametric reforms are going to create fiscal space (by reducing the pension
deficit-which    i s predicted to increase in the long term up to 7 percent o f old-GDP unless
reformed-from      today's 4 percent o f old-GDP to about 2 percent by 2035 and below 0.5 percent
in the longer term) and albeit the use of such fiscal space will depend on economic and social
considerations in the future, it would allow for additional expenditures (or a reduced overall
borrowing requirement o f Government) which are potentially more progressive than the current
tax financing o f the deficit that does not benefit the poor. Second, the parametric reforms would
strengthenthe expected benefits from formalization from the workers' perspective by increasing
the likelihood o f pension payments in the future - and while demand from formal private
enterprises appears to play a very important role in determining the choice o f formal/informal
work contracts today, such increased expected benefits could have an important positive impact
on formal employment in the future. More workers could then benefit from access to income-
maintenance instruments for their old-age.
5.       Other actions and reforms supported by PPDPL 2: dependent on further actions/reforms
to materialize positive distributional and poverty reduction potential. Apart from the above
direct (UHI) and more indirect (pension parametric reform) poverty and distributional impacts,
several other PPDPL 2 supported reforms and actions also have the potential o f benefiting the
poor - but, at this stage, the materialization o f such benefits are somewhat more removed from
those pertaining to the policy actions mentioned above. They are summarized in Table A 4
below.
6.       The reforms supported by the PPDPL program are also likely to have a positive impact on
gender equality. Women will benefit disproportionately from the introduction o f UHI, where
those currently uncovered (estimated at between 6 and 22 percent o f the population) will be
provided with full basic health coverage. Currently those without formal coverage, and many of
those with Green Card coverage, receive rudimentary or even no basic health care, although
critical health conditions are invariably treated by hospitals even when the patient has no
coverage. This results in many simple health problems escalating to more acute conditions.
Although there i s little evidence o f the uninsuredbeingrefused care, there are clearly increases in
female morbidity and a general lack o f efficiency resulting from this very imperfect system.
Extending improved quality ante-natal and other health care services to all women through UHI
will result in a major welfare gain and help Turkey to meet its MillenniumDevelopment Goals
on infant and maternal mortality.

7.      Inthe case of pension reform, the issues are more nuancedand complex. Currently, as in
many countries, women working in the formal sector effectively gain a higher rate of return on
their pension contributions due to a lower retirement age and greater longevity. However,
relatively few women are currently contributing (or beneficiaries) of the pension system and the
fiscal sustainability - and with it the likelihood of the pension system actually rewarding those
that have contributed during the working life - i s low. While the pension reform supported by
the PPDPL series equalizes the pro-female difference in the current system, it will raise the

                                                                                        Annex VI11
                                                                                         Page 4 of 4

likelihood o f receiving pension payments significantly. It i s also expected, and Government i s
making significant efforts through other reforms, to increase the effective protection o f the work
force by encouraging formal and more flexible employment, which should especially impact on
the share o fthe female work force covered bythe pensionregime inthe future.
8.      Complementarity o f PPDPL Program to Other Reforms: The reforms inthe PPDPL series
are complementary to reforms supported through other Bank lending instruments, most
importantly regarding labor market reform. Most importantly among these i s the labor market
reform which i s supported through the CEDPL (P074181). The social security reform and the
envisaged improvements in fiscal balances are expected to lay the ground for labor market
reforms. With employment generation as well as advance on the job ladder beingthe most direct
possibility for poorer families to improve their well-being, labor market actions and reforms that
contribute to job creation and better risk protection o f workers are core to any anti-poverty
strategy. The Bank has undertaken a significant amount o f analytical work on labor markets in
Turkey over the past years, including a Labor Market Study (2006) and a report on youth
employment as well as the labor market impact of a reduction in social security taxation. These
form the analytical basis for the Bank's support inthis area.

       ANNEXIx:DECENTRALIZATION FISCAL   AND           RISKS:INTERNATIONALEXPERIENCE

 1.      Over the last twenty years, over two thirds o f the world's nations (excluding microstates)
have embarked upon some form of decentralization which can take several forms. Perhaps the
most important -even        the sine qua non-       aspect o f decentralization i s political: the
transformation o f former administrative units o f central government into separate political
entities, with leadership chosen through local elections rather than by central appointment.
Decentralization can also take the form o f explicit transfers o f functional responsibilities to local
administrations. It may involve an increase in local resources, either through an expansion o f
local taxing powers or an increase in intergovernmental transfers. Decentralization can also take
the more subtle form of deregulation, such as the removal of the central government's authority
to approve local budgets or control the number or salary levels o f local staff,
2.      Inprinciple, decentralization can increase the efficiency and responsiveness of the public
sector. Devolving resource allocation decisions to locally elected leaders can improve the match
between the mix of services produced by the public sector and the preferences o f the local
population. (Oates 1972). This is, inpart, because local officials are better acquainted with local
conditions and priorities than their counterparts at the central level. In addition, they are more
accessible to their constituents and can be held accountable for local results through local
elections. (Ostrom, Schroeder, and Wynne 1993). Decentralization can also increase the variety
o f services provided in different jurisdictions, allowing citizens to "vote with their feet'' and
locate themselves injurisdictions that match their particular preferences. (Tiebout 1956; Inman
and Rubenfeld 1997).
3.      There are downside risks to decentralization. First, o f course, is the risk that locally
elected officials may be no more responsive to their constituents than their centrally-appointed
predecessors. Local democracy i s a fallible instrument. Local governments are as susceptible to
capture by special interests as officeholders at higher levels o f government. Decentralization also
carries other, more inherent, risks. Local governments are likely to take a parochial view o f the
public interest. In making spending decisions, they can be expected to take only the interests o f
their constituents into account. This may be a virtue when the issue is the frequency of garbage
collection, but not when it involves services, such as sewage treatment, that affect other
jurisdictions. Functional decentralization may run aground on the limited technical capacities o f
local government. Local governments-particularly       small ones-often    have difficulty attracting
and retaining qualified staff. It may also widen disparities in the quality o f services offered by
different jurisdiction. In the absence o f central financial support, decentralizing primary
education can result inwider variations inper student spendingthan might be desirable.
4.      Decentralization may also pose macroeconomic risks.These can take several forms:
Structural deficits
5.      Long term structural deficits can arise when governments increase the resources o f local
governments without transferring a corresponding level of expenditure responsibilities. Brazil's
1988 Constitution, for example, required the federal government to transfer nearly half the
proceeds of its two principal taxes to local administrations, but made no provision for a
corresponding transfer o f expenditures. To reduce its resulting deficit, the Government was

                                                                                               Annex I X
                                                                                              Page 2 of 3

forced to increase its reliance on revenue sources not subject to sharing-principally             social
security contributions-and    make drastic cuts incapital spending.
6.      Such deficits are not an inherent part o f decentralization. Governments can, and do,
transfer expenditure responsibilities along with revenues. (In fact, governments in Eastern
Europe and Africa have been more inclined to offload functional responsibilities without
revenues than the other way around.) In the short term, one approach i s to limit the amount o f
increases in local revenues to the amount the government was spending on the function in
question inthe year before it was decentralized. This ensures budget neutrality. It i s not however,
a long term solution, as it locks in an arbitrary level and geographical distribution o f spending.
Government can provide a more flexible and better targeted method o f allocation by
incorporating the increased level o f funding into an existing revenue sharing formula or by
distributing funds on an earmarked basis according to a formula specifically devised for the
function in question. The recent EU accession countries, for example, distribute general revenue
sharing on a mixed origidpopulation basis but distribute funding for teachers salaries on the
basis o f enrollment. Note that in all such cases, governments need to adopt a transitional
arrangement to avoid sudden cuts in the revenues o f individual jurisdictions. This can be
accomplished through the use o f buffers (Le., a limit on the percentage change in transfers from
one year to the next) or, if affordable, through hold-harmless provisions that ensure that no
jurisdiction will suffer a loss intransfer revenues, at least innominal terms.
Loss of control overfiscal policy
7.      Decentralization can also hamper a government's ability to exercise fiscal policy, by
ceding control over major tax instrumentsto local administrations or by permanently obligating
central governments to share a fixed proportion o f their revenues with local units. Under these
circumstances, central governments may find themselves unable to generate sufficient revenue
for the national government. Again, this i s not an inherent drawback. Governments in Eastern
Europe, for example, fix the level o f transfers on an annual basis, taking into account both local
and macro-economic interests.
Local borrowing
8.      But it is not only structural imbalances betweenrevenuesand expenditures or the loss o f
control over fiscal policy that constitute the fiscal risks o f decentralization. There i s also the risk
that newly empowered local governments may borrow excessively and then force central
governments to come to their relief.
9.      Subnational governments borrow in a variety o f ways. They run up salary arrears to their
employees. They run up arrears to contractors, suppliers, and public utilities. They fail to pay
their employees' social security or income tax obligations to the central authorities. They also
undertake more explicit forms o f debt. They borrow from private domestic and foreign banks.
They borrow from IFIs, with or without government guarantees. Some float bonds.
10.     Some such forms o f borrowing would appear to be self-limiting. Suppliers are unlikelyto
continue to extend credit if they go unpaid. Unpaid public employees may go on strike. Private
banks, with their own capital at risk, would appear to have a strong incentive to lend prudently.
But evidence suggests otherwise. Recent history is littered with cases o f sub-national
governments that have run up unsustainable levels o f debt and have appealed, successfully, to

                                                                                          Annex IX
                                                                                         Page 3 of 3

central governments for debt relief. This creates a clear moral hazard. It encourages sub-national
governments to over-borrow and creditors to over-lend, secure inthe knowledge that the national
government will come to their mutualrelief.
11.     One solution to this problem i s regulation. Many countries in Latin America and Eastern
Europe, for example, impose ceilings on local government borrowing. These typically take the
form of maximum debt service-to-revenue ratios or debt stock-to-revenue ratios. Some permit
central governments to withhold debt service from intergovernmental transfers. Some also
regulate the supply of credit, imposing high reserve requirements on banks for loans to local
government. A few have introduced bankruptcy procedures, which, in extremis, turn local
financial decision-making power over to a court- or government-appointed receiver, until such
time as the local government is able to meet its obligations.
12.    Regulation is only as effective as the political willingness to enforce it. Inthe absence of
consistent and comprehensive enforcement, it is sometimes necessaryfor a central government to
demonstrate the consequences of irresponsible borrowing by standing aside while a local
government defaults. Once private lenders are persuaded that lending to sub-national
governments carries real risks, they may be more likely to confine their loans to local
governments that are likely to repay.
