DIh3CTORS ON A PIDPOSED LOAN M1 NACIONAL FINA.NCIERA, S.A.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE UNITE} MEXICAN STATES
FOR RIO SINAIDA IRRIGATION PRDJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in various currencies equivalent to US$47 million to Nacional Finan-
ciera, S.A. (NAFIN) to assist in financing the Rio Sinaloa Irrigation
Project. The loan would be guaranteed by the United Mexican States and
would have a term of 25 years including 5 years of grace, with interest
at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMW
2.       ltThe Economy of Mexico: A Basic Report" (192-ME) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on June 26, 1973. It was designed to provide a
long-term perspective and a framework for the assessment of short-run trends
in the Mexican economy. An updating report will be prepared this spring and
is scheduled to be distributed to the Executive Directors in mid-1974.
Country Data sheets are provided in Annex I.
3.        For the three most recent of the six decades since the Revolution
of 1910, the success of the Mexican system, measured in terms of GDP growth,
has been outstanding. Since 1940, the annual average growth rate has ex-
ceeded 6 percent. And from the mid-1950's to 1972 Mexico was among the few
countries in the developing world to combine a sustained high rate of
growth with monetary and balance of payments stability. The average annual
rate of inflation was less than 5 percent and the dollar value of the peso
was maintained at the level fixed in 1954.
4o        Rapid and sustained growth was the product of successfutL policies
affecting the mobilization and use of both private and public sector re-
sources. The role of Government in promoting economic growth was concerned
on one hand with the development of strategic infrastructure and major uti-
lity industries and on the other with development policies which featured,
in the agricultural sector, the development of price support, import control
and agrarian reform measures, and in the industrial sector external pro-
tection and the provision of fiscal incentives.
5.        The sectoral allocation of public and private investment was
reflected in a changing structure of output and employment. This featured
the growth of manufacturing industry and the relative decline of agri-
culture, although agriculture remained the chief source of employment, ac-
counting in 1970 for 39 percent of the economically active population.



-2-
6.        Rapid economic grwoth has not generated sufficient opportun-
ities to create employment for the labor force which has recently been
growing at about 3.5 percent per year. In 1970 it was estimated that
40 percent of the labor force was either engaged in marginal occupations
- relatively unproductive and hence poorly paid - or totally unemployed.
Partly as a consequence of rapid population growth, but also as a result
of the distribution of incomes and assets in the Mexican economy, the
strategy which succeeded in promoting rapid growth was not comparably suc-
cessful in spreading its benefits. The incidence of poverty had by 1970
been much reduced from the level of 1940. But the differentials between
rich and poor, both between people and between places, had probably
increased.
7.        There was, until recently, little evidence (apart from the con-
tinuation of the land reform program begun in earnest during the Cardenas
regime in the 1930's) that Government policies were much concerned with
these problems. By 1970, however, it was apparent that a revised economic
strategy - one which would focus on the improvement of the living conditions
of the poor - was required. It seemed to be understood that this goal
should not be pursued at the expense of rapid growth or of the monetary
and balance of payments stability which appeared to be a sine qua non of
sustained economic expansion. The events and trends of the last three years
have demonstrated the Government's determination to develop such a strategy.
They have also revealed some of the constraints to doing so.
There are several types of distributive measures which do not
depend heavily on the growth of budgetary expenditures. Among those
introduced since 1970 are a new Agrarian Reform Law (1971), a new Water
Law (1971) and a revision of instructions concerning the allocation of bank
credit (designed to increase the flow of resources to low income farmers
and ejidatarios). 1/ These measures are all responsive to the needs of
the laral sector and demonstrate the Government's concern to confront them.
Another recent initiative is the introduction (1972) of a 5 percent payroll
tax 2/ to finance a new housing program for workers in the lower-middle
income groups. It is clear, however, in the light of the experience of the
last three years, that neither the needs of the poor nor those of the public
sector industries (on which the growth of the economy as a whole partly
depends) can be met unless the Government takes new measures to mobilize
additional public sector resources.
9.        In 1971 the Government acted to restrain the growth of the economy
iln order to preserve stability and, partly as a result, the growth rate
fell from the 1960-1970 decade average of 7.1 percent to only 3.7 percent,
while prices increased by 4.8 percent. In J972 renewed expansion was
stimulated by public sector expenditures and the GDP growth rate rose to
7.5 percent, while prices increased (in terms of the GDP deflator) by
slightly more than 5 percent. In 1973 there was a further substantial

purposes of public finance analysis.

increase in public expenditures which was largely financed by recourse
to increased internal and external borrowing. This expansion coincided
with and iwas partially responsible for an acceleration in the rate of
domestic price increases. These increases are also, however, a conse-
quence of imported inflation (the impact of which was especially serious
because of the poor harvest in 1972 and the resulting need to import
basic foodstuffs in a year of high commodity prices). Prices increased
by roughly 20 percent during 1973 - somewhat more in the case of whole-
sale prices and somewhat less in the case of consumer prices.
10.       In the light of these trends, the Government is introducing
substantial new resource mobilization measures to generate the funds
required to support the growth of public expenditures. Following some
changes in the tax structure in 1972 and 1973, it is understood that there
will be a more substantial increase in taxation in 1974. The action which
was taken in October 1973 to adjust electricity rates (by an average of
almost 30 percent) was followed by substantial increases in hydrocarbons
prices in December 1973. The total of the revenue measures which have been
taken or are under consideration is expected to yield the equivalent of
approximately 2 percent of 1974 GDP.
11.       These measures to increase public sector revenues are clearly
needed and they will permit a reduction in the public sector deficit as
well as a moderate increase in expenditure in 1974. The rate of increase
in the latter, however, is likely to be slower than in 1973. There
should be some deceleration in the rate of inflation in 1974 compared to
1973, but the rate will still be higher than in other recent years, both
because of further expected increases in international prices and because
the inflationary trends of 1973 have resulted in substantial wage adjust-
ments which are likely to be reflected in higher costs and prices.
12.       It is unlikely that the rate of economic growth in 1974 will be
as high as the level of between 7 and 8 percent which is estimated for
1973. Growth will almost certainly be restrained by the capacity limit-
ations derived from the low level of private investment in the last three
years and because the Government recognizes the need to limit imports in
order to contain the balance of payments deficit to an acceptable level.
It is quite probable, therefore, that 1974 will be a year of fiscal and
financial retrenchment and of moderate growth.
13.       The events of recent months have illustrated the dangers inherent
in large scale deficit financing, but also the willingness of the Government
to take the kinds of corrective action which become necessary. The record
of the Mexican authorities in economic management over the past two decades
is such that there is reason to give credence to the Government's assurances
that it will act to restore the relative price and balance of payments sta-
bility which, in terms of the recent experience of the Mexican economy, ap-
pear to be necessary conditions of sustained growth. The Bank, as well as
the Fund, is in a continuing dialogue with the Government regarding these
issues.



- 4 -
1A.       As of December 31, 1972, Mexico's outstanding disbursed ex-
ternal public debt was US$4.0 billion as compared with a total of US$3.5
billion a year earlier. The IBRD share in the former total was US$723
million as compared with a level of US$659 million a year before. For
1973, net public medium and long-term external borrowing is estimated
at about Us$1,300 million. This represents a sharp increase over the
1972 level ($451 million), and reflects the larger public sector defi-
cit in 1973, a greater reliance upon external rather than domestic bor-
rowing to finance the deficit and some borrowing undertaken to of-fset
short-term capital movements. The substantial revenue measures re-
cently taken will reduce the public sector's needs to borrow in 1974.
15.       Annex I, Page 4 shows that 41.3 percent of public external ca-
pital contracted in the period 1968-1972 was obtained from private banks
- the largest single source and that international organizations ac-
counted for the next largest share (22.2 percent). The World Bank ac-
counted for 14.7 percent of total commitments.  Annex I, Page 4 also
shows the sectoral allocation of public external capital and reveals
that power, transport and manufacturing were the dominant sectors. The
terms of recent public external borrowing have continued to improve in
the light of (a) the availability of capital in international markets
and (b) Mexico's reputation as a creditworthy borrower.
16.       During 1974, assuming normal private capital movements, it is
expected that the level of net external borrowing by the public sector
(or guaranteed by the public sector) will decline to around US$950 -
US$1,000 million. Net borrowing of this magnitude is consistent with
Mexico's debt service capacity. As a result, particularly of longer
maturities on borrowings from financial institutions, Mexico's external
public debt service ratio has declined over the last several years and
was 18,2 percent in 1973. Assuming that the average terms in the future
are about the same as those which have been recently obtained, the debt
service ratio is expected to remain in the 18 to 20 percent range during
the remainder of the 1970's. The Bank's share in public debt outstanding
and disbursed is presently about 14 percent while its share in the corres-
ponding debt service is about 10 percent. These ratios are not expected
to change significantly during the remainder of the 1970's.
17e       Mexico thus continues to be creditworthy for borroving on con-
ventional terms, always provided that the additional public savings
measures are taken without undue delay. The rate increases recently
enacted by the publicly owned electric power sector and the recent in-
crease in the prices of the publicly owned hydrocarbons industry, suggest
that the Government will continue to handle its financing affairs prudently.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MEXICO
18.       The Bank has made 33 loans, for a total of US$1,599 million net
of cancellations, of which at the end of December 31,1973 the Bank held
US$1.3   billion including US$04Z billion not yet disbursed.  Most of these
loans have been made Tor power, roads and agriculture. Execution of Bank-
financed projects has, on the whole, been satisfactory. However, disburse-
ments on the US$125 million loan for the Fourth Power Sector Program were
delayed because the Government found it impossible to effect necessary
power tariff changes on schedule. The problem was resolved when tariffs
were increased on October 16, 1973.



19.       IFC has made eleven investment commitments in Mexico amounting
to US$53.1 million, of which as of December 31, 1973, US$35.4 million had
been sold, terminated or cancelled. The US$17.7 million held by the Cor-
poration consists of US$15.9 million in loans and US$1.8 million in equity.
Annex II contains a summary of Bank loans and IFC investments as of Decem-
ber 31, 1973, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
20.       Bank lending to Mexico in FY73 consisted of two loans, for agri-
culture and water supply, totalling US$200 million. The FY74 program in-
cludes, in addition to the Las Truchas Steel PrQject approved last
September,  the  VII  Highway  Project  and  the  Sinaloa -aiid  Panuco
Irrigation Projects under consideration today.  In addition, wokc is under
way on rural development, irrigation, forest industries and transport proj-
ects for possible consideration by the Ececutive Directors during the next
two years.
21.       In lending to Mexico, the Bank tries to assist the Government in
achieving four major objectives. These objectives are interdependent and
complementary; hence, it is not possible to rank them in order of priority
or importance. One objective is to spread the benefits of growth more
widely than before and, more particularly, to begin to address the problem
of rural poverty. A second objective is to help Mexico continue to achieve
the remarkable growth of output of the past two decades, both by investing
in projects that directly or indirectly make large contributions to prodac-
tion and employment, and by supporting changes that will make existing
institutions function more effectively or by creating new ones that will
perform presently neglected functions. A third objective is to contribute
with funds and expertise to the solution of critical adjustment problems
that are themselves a result of Mexico's continued growth; noteworthy among
these are the problems attendant on a rapid urban expansion, and the
emerging need to exploit scarce water resources more efficiently. A
fourth objective is to transfer sufficient external resources to complement
Mexico's quite appreciable domestic savings and provide the necessary funds
for sufficient economic and social investments in a framework of sound
domestic finances and a viable balance of payments.
22.       While the last objective primarily influences the magnitude of
the Bankts program in Mexico, the other three jointly determine its struc-
ture. Naturally, many operations serve more than one of the ends listed
and may, moreover, support more specific Government objectives. Thus the
Sinaloa and Panuco Irrigation Projects are designed not only to help expand
pro(iuction but also to support the Governmentls policies on income redistri-
bution as expressed in the Land Reform and Water Laws, both of 1971. Con-
cern with the vital issue of better water management also induced the Gov-
ernment, the Banlc and UNDP to organize, jointly, a national water study;
the Bank serves as Ececuting Agency for the UNDP. The Study has the prin-
cipal objectives of formulating alternative water development programs for
the short, medium and long-term and of adopting key policy decisions con-
cerning water development and management. It is expected to use the results
of the Study - as they become available - for the identification and



- 6 -
analysis of future irrigation projects. Loans in the transport and power
sectors are designed explicitly both to transfer resources to Mexico and
to help improve institutional structures and policies in sectors that play
a vital role in industrial and agricultural production and in the genera-
tion and utilization of public sector resources. At the same time, the
Government, together with the Bank, is attempting to prepare integrated
rural investment projects in regions in which income levels are low but
where some productive potential can be identified.
PASU III - THE AG1CICULTURAL SECTOR
23.       Agriculture has been a dynamic element of Mexico's economic de-
velopment. The sector's growth of close to 6 percent p.a. in real terms
over nearly three decades (1940-1965), is a record matched by only a few
countries. It has managed to satisfy the demand of a rapidly growing po-
pulation and to transform the country from a net importer to a net exporter
of agricultural products. While the growth of agricultural output has been
attributable primarily to expansion of the area under cultivation, it has
of late become increasingly dependent on productivity increases and on
changes in composition to higher valued crops. Public investment has
played a key role in these processes. However, the share of agricultural
investment - primarily irrigation - in the public budget declined after
1950 (from 19.3 percent to 13.6 percent in 1970). This shift is one of
the causes accounting for the reduction in sectoral growth from an annual
rate exceeding 7.5 percent in the forties to less than 4 percent in the
sixties.
24.       Although agriculture contributed only 10.1 percent to GDP in
1972, the sector is still the largest employer, with nearly 40 percent of
Mexico's labor force. It is also the most important foreign exchange
earner outside of tourism; agricultural exports amounted to US$673 mil-
lion in 1972, nearly half of total commodity exports. Favourable external
factors have benefited exports and have led to an increasing integration
of Mexico's northern agriculture with the U.S. market. The most important
export products are cotton and livestock, each accounting for about 21 per-
cent of total export value, followed by tomatoes, sugar and coffee. Res-
ponding to trends in domestic and foreign demand, livestock has developed
more rapidly than crop production, increasing its share to nearly a third
of total output in 1972. However, corn and beans continue to be the basic
components of the Mexican diet and remain the subsistence crops for most
of the peasants; together they account for nearly 70 percent of the rain-
fed and 10 percent of the irrigation cropland.
25.       Irrigation has traditionally accounted for about three-fourths
of Government investment in agriculture; a reflection both of Mexico's
climatic conditions and the technical competence of the staff of the
Ministry of Hydraulic Resources (SRH). Irrigation is a sine qua non of



agricultural production in most of MexicoIs cultivable areas, and public
irrigation programs have in fact been a chief source of output growth
since 1940; over 25 percent oL^ total output expansion originated in irri-
gation districts which contributed 40 percent of total agricultural and
60 percent of total crop output in 1972. Public irrigation projects
have laid the foundation for a modern, sophisticated, commercial sector
which helped the country to earn the foreign exchange needed to industri-
alize, but at the same time they tended to benefit, principally, the
large-scale farmers and hence to accentuate the skewness of the rural
income distribution.
26.       Thus, although until recently agriculture policies were success-
ful in raising production, they were not capable of solving the pressing
problems of rural unemployment, high degrees of income concentration and
accelerated rates of rural-urban migration. The Revolution of 1910 led to
the far reaching Agrarian Reform Legislation of 1917, under which nearly
half of Mexico's total land area was redistributed. The rural society
has nevertheless undergone little change. It is still polarized into a
small, highly efficient and rich class of rural entrepreneurs and a large
class of poor peasants and ejidatarios which have, to a large extent, been
bypassed by the rapid economic growth of the post-revolution period and
even today barely participate in the market economy.
27.       The rural poverty problem is a compound of an overall shortage of
productive land, inequality in land ownership and inadequate public services.
According to a recent study, only 7 percent of the almost 3 million farms in
Mexico are modern while 53 percent are classified as subsistence units and
another 40 percent as traditional, producing only small marketable surpluses.
The rural population has grown faster than the land under cultivation, leading
to excessive fragmentation of holdings in many parts of the country and
a landless rural labor force of close to two million. At the same time,
only 1 percent of the farmers still controlled more than 30 percent of to-
tal cropland in 1960 and 5 percent of the farms in public irrigation dis-
tricts owned more than 40 percent of the area in 1965. The skewed land
distribution is reflected in the distribution of rural income9 It is es-
timated that 10 percent of the farmers accounted for 40 percent of total
rural income including proceeds from sources other than agriculture.
28.       President Echeverrials Administration, which has been in office
since the end of 1970, is attempting to reconcile the twin objectives of
economic growth and income redistribution. It has given particular at-
tention to agriculture and has substantially increased the budget alloca-
tions to this sector in absolute terms and relative   to other sectors.
While the expansion of the irrigation, credit and extension programs is
expected to raise the growth of output to the rates achieved in the past,
the Government has initiated several measures to ensure that the earnings
and living conditions of the rural poor are improved at the same time.
These include the enactment of a new Agrarian Reform Law (1971), a new
Water Law (1971), instruction to the banking system to channel part of



- 8 -
its resources to small farmers and ejidatarios, and large appropriations
for an integrated rural development program.
29.       The new Agrarian Reform Law is directed to strengthening the
legal and institutional bases of the ejido, to transforming the ejido into
an efficient production unit and to accelerating the granting of definite
land titles. The agricultural credit program, supported by the Bank-
financed Fourth Agricultural and Livestock Project, seeks to gear credit
institutions more to the needs of the small farmers and to enable them
to benefit from modern production technology. The rural development pro-
gram, for which US$200 million have been appropriated in the 1973 budget,
with a total investment of about Us$1.5 billion planned for 1973-1976, is
the most ambitious Government effort to mitigate rural poverty by helping
the landless and seasonally unemployed as well as improving the productive
base of the smallholders and ejidatarios.
30.       The new Water Law reduces the maximum permitted holdings in new
irrigation districts from 100 has per owner to 20 has. The excess land is
to be distributed to small farmers and landless families. While the new
ceiling is still large enough to permit the application of modern methods
of production, it will significantly change the distributional incidence
of new irrigation projects. At the same time, SRH has diversified its
policy; considerations of income distribution and employment are given
more importance in project evaluation and more emphasis is placed on al-
ternative investment options including conjunctive ground and surface
water use, phasing of construction and non-structural alternatives like
intensified grassland utilization with drainage improvement. Notable
among the new or expanded activities of SRH are also a program specially
designed to increase efficiency of water use and yields in existing ir-
rigation districts (PLAKEPA), and a small-scale irrigation program which
is addressed exclusively to the poor peasants; both programs are fi-
nanced with assistance from the Interamerican Development Bank.
PART IV - THE PhDJECT
31.       The proposed project would be the ninth Bank operation for agri-
culture in Mexico. Previous lending in the sector consisted of four loans
for agricultural credit and four for irrigation. A sixth irrigation proj-
ect, Panuco Irrigation, is being presented at the same time as the Rio
Sinaloa Project.
32.       The Rio Sinaloa  project was appraised in two stages.  The first
appraisal mission visited the area in November/December 1972 and recommend-
ed combining Phase I (diversion dam and irrigation distribution and drainage
systems for 40,000 has) and Phase II (storage dam and irrigation and drain-
age systems for another 60,000 has) in order to allow full use of the
available surface water flows and to minimize the risk of temporary irriga-
tion water shortages in the Phase I area. After completion of the request-



- 9 -
ed additional studies, appraisal of the combined project was completed in
May 1973. Negotiations were held in Washington from January 14 to
January 18, 1974. The main negotiators were Ing. Ignacio Aguilar Alvarez
(Ministry of Hydraulic Resources), Lico Fernando Torres (NAITN), and Lic.
Narciso Acevedo (Ministry of Finance) assisted by seven members of the
Guarantor's and Borrower's staff. A report entitled "Appraisal of the
Rio Sinaloa Irrigation Project" (No. 281a-ME, dated February 4, 1974) is
being distributed separately to the Executive Directors. Annex III con-
tains a loan and project summary.
Project Description
33.       The proposed project would consist of integrated irrigation and
agricultural development of 100,000 has along both banks of the Sinaloa
River in the State of Sinaloa. The project would include a storage and a
diversion dam, complete irrigation distribution and drainage systems, wells
to supplement surface water supply and, in addition, an intensive extension
service over a four-year period. The project area comprises thle old irri-
gation district of Guasave (22,000 has), the area on each bank with limited
and irregular water supply (23,000 has) and the dryland area (55,000 has).
Because of the inefficiency of the present irrigation system and lack of
dependable surface water flows, presently only about 48,000 has are crop-
ped in the project area on the average per year. The project, through full.
utilization of the Rio Sinaloa flows and augmented by groundwater pumping
together with modern irrigation and farming techniques, would make double
cropping possible; it is estimated that on the average 26,000 has could be
double cropped per year, resulting in a cropping intensity of 126 percent
on the total project area of 100,000 has.
Project Objectives
34.       The proposed project has two principal objectives. First, it
aims at increasing agricultural production to satisfy domestic demand and
to help improve Mexico's balance of payments position. The value of incre-
mental annual production originating from the project will be close to
US$30 million, equivalent in gross terms to over 2 percent of Mexico's 1972
crop production. Nearly two-fifths of the production in value terms, pre-
dominantly vegetables, fruits and cotton, will be exported. Most of the
fruits and vegetables would be marketed to the U.S. through CAADES (Confe-
deraci6n de Asociaciones Agrlcolas del Estado de Sinaloa), which is the
largest supplier of imported fruits and vegetables to the U.S. The ex-
pansion of cotton production under the project would help to overcome the
decline which has been occuring in Mexico's total cotton production and
exports. Most of the remaining output will substitute for imports of soy-
beans, wheat, sorghum and safflower, which will have ready markets within
Mexico.
35.       The second major objective of the project is to mitigate prob-
lems of rural poverty in the Sinaloa area. The project marks the first
application of the new Water Law on a large scale. It is expected that



- 10 -
23,400 has will be redistributed within the new irrigation district on
which 2,350 ejidatario families will be settled. The redistribution in
the area under new irrigation will affect both private farmers and
existing ejidos; the holdings of the private farmers will be reduced to
the maximum permissible size of 20 has and the ejidos reorganized so
that no ejidatario has a holding larger than 10 has. While this limita-
tion on owned land under the new Water Law is only applicable to new ir-
rigation districts, the Government is also negotiating with the farmers
in the old irrigation district of Guasave with the objective of rediuc-
ing their holdings to between 50 and 80 percen-t of present size, subject
to a minimum of 20 has and a maximum of 100 has. Thus the total amount
of land to be redistributed is likely to be larger than the 23,400 has
of the new irrigation district.
36.       The project will not only benefit the 2,350 newly settled eji-
datarios but also increase the income of the 10,900 existing ejidatarios
and 1,100 private farmers, some 75,000 persons in total. The average
farm income for both ejidatarios and private farmers will be raised sub-
stantially, but individual income levels will vary with farm size and
cropping pattern. The final income distribution will depend, in parti-
cular, on each farmer's area under vegetables, which yield much higher
retunLs than any other crop.
37.       While the project area under vegetables is to be limited to
6,000 has, consistent with estimates of demand in the U.S. and the domestic
market, as well as with production plans in other irrigation projects, the
number of farmers who can successfully market vegetables is also restrict-
ed. The lucrative export market has been dominated by CAADES, which has
easy access to credit, has established a sophisticated and efficient mar-
keting organization, stays in close touch with developments in the U.S.
market and lays out production and marketing plans to avoid excessive
price fluctuations. To help the ejidatarios participate more equitably
in the high income yielding crops, the Government is taking measures of
organizational and marketing assistance coupled with steps to ensure
prompt and adequate availability of credit which will enable the ejidata-
rios to take on a share of the domestic market and gradually move into
the export of less perishable vegetables, e.g. onions and potatoes. The
speed and extent of the results of such measures are, of course, diffi-
cult to predict with precision. The possible range and the most likely
result of the project's income incidence are nevertheless projected in
the table below.
38.       The stmost likely result" is based on the assumption that the
ejidatarios as a group will account for about 20 percent of the total
vegetable production from the project. The "maximum spread" between in-
cremental ejidatario and private farmer income is indicative of what
would occur if the ejidatarios would not produce any vegetables at all
and the ltminimum spread" would obtain if the ejidatarios would cultivate
1,000 has more of vegetables for the domestic market, in addition to the
20 percent share. In the latter case, the economic rate of return on the
total project would also be higher than that estimated, since total high
value crop production would be greater.

1/ After taxes and before water charges. Since appraisal, prices of grains
have increased substantially, which would not only raise the income of
the ejitdatario in absolute terms but also reduce his income disparity
with private farmers.
2/ Most of the ejidatarios are also employed as rural laborers and may be
earning $200-400 in addition to farm income, depending on number of days
employed.
Water Charges
39.       The water charges will consist of two components; one for opera-
tion and maintenance and one for investment recovery. While the operation
and maintenance costs of the irrigation and drainage systems will be fully
recovered from each beneficiary in proportion to his farm size, the com-
pensation charges for the recovery of capital investment will be determined
according to the payment capacity of the beneficiaries. SRH intends to
link the compensation charges to water volume and to the cropping pattern,
which is used as a proxy for income. A substantial progressivity will be
built into the compensation charges as higher rates will be levied for
higher value crops than for lower value crops. The actual compensation
charges will only be determined after completion of a detailed socio-
economic study - prescribed by law - on the payment capacity of the indi-
vidual farmers. The Bank will be given an opportunity to comment on the
conclusions and recommendations o; the study promptly after completion.
Investment Recovery
40.       While it is the Government's objective to recover the projectts
investment costs at the earliest possible time, estimates on the time span
of repayment can only be made with accuracy once the socio-economic studies
have been completed. It will depend on (a) the farmers' net income after
meeting all crop production costs, taxes and project operation and main-
tenance charges less (b) the amount he needs to cover his family living
costs and have a reasonable incentive to continue irrigated farming. Pre-
liminary estimates indicate that, if raising farmers, net income to twice



- 12 -
the regional minimum salary, which is equivalent to the approximate cut-
off point for the lowest 40 percent of incomes, is accepted as a reason-
able target, about one-fourth of the "most likely" incremental income
would be available for payment of water charges. This would make it pos-
sible for the Government to fully recover investment costs, without in-
terest, within about 32 years.  It should be noted that, in addition to
the direct water charges, general taxes on incremental crop production
would serve to substantially increase total returns to the Government.
Management and Organization
41.       Responsibility for project planning, execution and operation
rests with the Comision del Rio Fuerte, created in 1951 by Presidential
decree as an agency within the Ministry of Hydraulic Resources. The Co-
mision is empowered with exclusive authority to develop all water related
projects in the Rio Fuerte Basin, including the Rio Sinaloa. It has a
high caliber technical staff and has been operating successfully two other
large irrigation projects.  Agricultural development - annual cropping
pattern, water allocation, technical assistance and credit - would be
handled by a Management Committee, comprising representatives of the Co-
mision, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Department of Agrarian Reform
and Colonization, participating banks and the farmers.
Costs and Financing
42.       The capital requirements of the project - including interest
during construction on the proposed loan (US$6.O million) - are US$145.6
million. The Bank loan would finance the estimated foreign exchange costs
of the project except for US$3.4 million consisting of material and equip-
ment which the Government furnishes directly to the contractors and of ne-
gotiated contracts other than those for land clearing and leveling, plus
50 percent of the local costs of extension services during the development
period ($0.7 million). The remaining costs would be met through Govern-
ment budgetary allocations.
Procurement
43.       Contracts for civil works would be let under international com-
petitive bidding and, whenever feasible, be grouped into large packages
of at least $1.8 mi].lion. International competitive bidding would not be
required for land clearing and leveling and instead SRH would contract
for them with local groups of farmers. This procedure has the advantage
of associating the ejidatarios and farmers ultimately benefiting from the
project in the execution of these works and, even more importantly, pro-
vides them with training for adoption of soil conservation practices under
the proposed loan. International competitive bidding would also not be
required for smaller contracts which, because of nature or timing, cannot
rationally be included in the major contracts. The items exempt from
international competitive bidding would account for less than 20 percent



- 13 -
of civil works contracts to be financed by the Bank, which has been the
limit for awards on local bids and negotiated contracts under the pre-
vious irrigation loans.
Disbursement
44.       The Bank loan would be disbursed against (i) 38 percent of
payments to contractors of civil works let umnder international competi-
tive bidding and negotiated contracts for land clearing and leveling
and for small works not exceeding Mex$l million each up to an aggregate
maximum of Mes$20 million, (ii) 100 percent of foreign expenditure of
equipment purchased under international competitive bidding, (iii) 50
percent of the cost of intensive extension service during the initial
period of the project and, (iv) cover 100 percent of interest during
construction on the loan. The loan would be disbursed in seven years,
1974-1980.
45.       Retroactive financing not exceeding $1.0 million is recommended
for advance contracts placed under ICB of the Sinaloa de Leyva diversion
dam and the first 17 kms. of main canal on the left bank.
Economic Evaluation
46.       With the contruction of the reservoir, the project area will
lend itself to effective planning of water use. The economic rate of
return is estimated at 17 percent which, using a combination of unlikely
unfavourable events, could drop as low as 12 percent. Secondary benefits
of the project have not been taken into account in the analysis nor have
the benefits from the minimum provision for the hydro-electric power plant,
water availability for domestic use, flood control and improved environ-
mental conditions been quantified. Of the approximately 75,000 benefi-
ciaries of the project (i.e. some 14,350 families), about 93 percent are
in the lowest 40 percent of Mexico's incorme recipients.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUlENTS AND AUTHORILTY
47.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Nacional Finan-
ciera, S.A.; the draft Guarantee Agreement between the United Mexican
States and the Bank; the Report of the Committee provided for in Article
III (Section 4, iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and a draft Resolution
approving the proposed loan, are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
48,       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VI - REOMMENDATION
49.       In formulating this proposal, it has not been possible to
take full account of the consequences of recent increases in petroleum
prices. However, available information indicates that the proposed loan
remains fully justified.
50.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTI0N 1/
Ln. No. 450    Third Ir;igation Project- $19 Million Loan of May 25, 1966;
Closing Date: December 31, 193.
The revised project costs are about 33 percent higher than
estimated, but the project rate of return will not be affected
because of higher than anticipated returns. The Closing Date has
been extended by one year to December 1973. In spite of delays in
construction and land levelling, agricultural development has pro-
gressed satisfactorily; net farm incomes have risen by 38-45 percent,
and over two-thirds of farm population benefiting are ejidatarios.
Ln. No. 527    Fourth Irrigation Project:  $25 Million Loan of January 26,
1968; Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Estimated project costs have risen by about 36 percent.
Project benefits will be higher than estimated at appraisal, but
probably not enough to fully offset the cost increases. Civil works
are about 50 percent complete. The original Closing Date (June 30,
1975) has been extended by one year to enable completion of works.
Ln. No. 528    Third Road Project:  $27.5 Million Loan of January 26, 1968;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
The project, initially delayed by increased earthworks, the
need for additional drainage structures and heavy rains, was com-
pleted in early 1973. The original Closing Date of March 31, 1972
has been extended to December 31, 1973 to permit completion of
disbursements.
Lin. No. 695   Fourth Road Project: $21.8 Million Loan of June 26, 1970;
Closing Date- June 30, 1975.
The project is slightly behind schedule because of initial
delays in budgetary allocations. This problem has now been resolved,
and disbursements have accelerated during 1973.
Ln. No. 747    Third Livestock and Agriculture Project:  $75 Million Loan of
June 9, 1971;  Closing Date:  September 30, 1975.
Progress continues at a satisfactory rate. Loan funds axe
expected to be fully committed by the end of June 1974 and fully
disbursed by the end of September 1974, ahead of schedule.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 793    Zihuatanejo Tourisn Project: $22 Million Loan of January 22,
1972. Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
Though the loan became effective only on March 31, 1973,
the physical performance under the project is satisfactory.
Ln. No. 820    Ports Project:  $20 Million Loan of May 17, 1972; Closing
Date: June 30, 1976.
The execution of the project is proceeding satisfactorily,
despite some delays in the preparation of tender documents. The
operations consultants financed under the loan have completed much
of their work, although an extension of their contract will be
necessary in order to allow time to implement their recommendations
and to complete tariff studies. The National Ports Development
Study, carried out as part of the project, is progressing satis-
factorily.
Ln. No. 824    Industrial Equipment Fund (FONEI) Project: $35 Million Loan
of June 2, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
The loan became effective on October 12, 1972. FONEI had a
slow start because of problems in organization and promotion, but
operations have picked up and several sub-loans have been approved
recently.
In. No. 825    Second Railway Project:  $75 Million Loan of June 2, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975,
The new management of the railways, appointed in May 1973,
is capable and recent changes in operating practices are expected
to improve operations. Significant progress has been made in pro-
curement and orders have been placed for most of the major items.
Recent wage awards and fuel price increases caused deterioration
in the financial position of the railways and a tariff increase is
urgently needed.
in. No. 834    Fourth Power Sector Program: $125 Million Loan of June 23,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1974.
The loan became effective on April 13, 1973. Increase in
power tariffs by December 31, 1972 was originally a condition of ef-
fectiveness of the loan. In December 1972, however, the Government
and the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), the Borrower, informed
the Bank that for reasons of domestic economic policy it would not
be possible to effect the electricity rate increase by December 31.
The loan included $35 million for payments due on orders placed be-
fore December 31, 1971, and which were being jointly financed with
other creditors. With the approval of Executive Directors (R73-23
of February 1, 1973) the Loan Agreement was amended to separate
this $35 million from the remainder of the loan. The loan was made



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 5
Ln. No. 834 (cont'd)
effective, although the $90 million which were not being used
for joint financing with other creditors were not eligible for
disbursement until the power tariffs were increased consistent
with the requirement that the Government and CFE take measures
to improve the company's financial position. Power rates were
increased on October 17, 1973.
In. No. 909    Mexico City Water Supply Project:  $90 Million Loan of June
18, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Effectiveness of this loan has been delayed because of dif-
ficulties in establishing contractual arrangements between the
Water Commission and the State of Mexico. The Commission has al-
ready constructed facilities to provide 700,000 inhabitants in the
Valley of Mexico with water. Slow progress has been made in engag-
ing the management consultants required under the project and in
starting the recommended studies.
Ln. No. 910    Fourth Livestock and Agriculture Project:  $110 Million Loan
of June 18, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978,
The loan became effective in October 1973 and the Govermnent
has begun implementing the Low Income Producers' Sub-Project, a new
departure initiated under this loan. It is proceeding satisfactorily.
Lending under the General Sub-Project, the other component of Loan
910-ME, will have to await full commitment of Loan 747-ME.
Ln. No. 934    Las Truchas Steel Project:  $70 Million Loan of September 12,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The loan became effective on October 29, 1973.
