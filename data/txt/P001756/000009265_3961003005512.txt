MEMORANDUM AND RUECOMMENATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTRNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCITION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDfT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MAU
FOR A MING SECTOR CAPACITY-BUIWING PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and reco ion on
a pred development aedit to the Republic of Mali for SDR 4.4 mfllion, equivalent to US$6.0
million, on standard IDA terms with a maturiy of 40 years to help finance a Muiing Sector
Capacity-Building Project.
A.
2.           Mali is a resourcepoor country with nearly 80% of its population dependent on
agrcture, which accunts for roughly half of GDP and two-thirds of exports. Its other
resources include minerls, in particular gold and possibly diamonds that, if developed, could
mak an Important contribution to the economy. Considerable geological work has been
undertaken in Mali largely with foreign aid, confirming that Mali has promising mineral
potentia. This potentia has not been developed, however, because not enough exploration and
development investment by the private sector has been forthcoming. This is largely the result
of deficient government policies, weak sector instittions, and the fact that the large amount of
geological data gnerated has not been properly organized, synthesized, and made readily
available to pote   investors. At present, the country produces about 4 tonnes of gold per year
and no diamonds. Gold is being produced by artisanal miners and by an industrial-scale mine
nanced and run by a foreign investor. The 'missing-middle', small- and medium-scale mines
financed and rn by local entrpreneurs, does not exist in Mali.
3.           Artisanal gold mining is important in Mali, as it has been for centuries, and is
a source of living for an esdmated 100,000 seasonal miners, a large proportion of whom are
women. However, artisanal miners operate under unsafe conditions, with very rudimentary
methods and equipm that now leave more than 50% of the gold in the ground. -wlay are
constrained from evolving to small- and medium-scale mining by a lack of access to more
efficient and safer technology and cannot benefit from larger-scale gold discoveries that they
cannot mine on their own because they are not eligible to hold mineral rights under the present
mimg code.
4.           Industrial-scale mining, on the other hand, has been stymied by an inadequate
mineral data base, by lack of a clear mining policy and strategy, by dysfunctional public
enterprises, and by sector instutions that have been guided by an outated interventionist
philosophy and weakened by corruption. It was only in the late 1980s that the sector was opened
to foreign private investors. One such investor, a well-known multinational mining company
(BHP-UTAH), opened a gold mine at Syama in southern Mali In 1990. The mine produces 2.5
toames of gold per year, worth approximately US$30 million anmually, representig 8.5% of
Mali's tota exports in 1990. This promising start is a result of consierable promotional efforts
by the Mimisty of Mines, Hydramlics and Eegy (MMHE). However, much more needs to be
done by the Government to promote growth in the sector. ITs includes successful



-2 -
implementati A of macro-economic adjustment programs and effective private sector-oriented
policies that would allow for stable and transparent regulations, a ompetitve and well structured
tax regime, and easy access to good and well oanized geological data. The Government has
launched an adjustment program supported by IDA, and is preparing a project that would
pdmarily focus on fosterig the development of the private sector. The Ministry of Mines,
Hydraulics and Energy, which is responsible for the sector through its Dlrecdon Nadonale de la
GEologle et des Mls (DNGM), is committed to taig more vigorous actions to stimulate
private invesm   in the sectr but operates with no clear, detailed sector policy or strategy to
guide it. Moreover, it is not orgaized to actively promote mining to the private sector. The
Mining Sector Capacity-Building Project will complement the proposed Private Sector
Development Project and focus on attracting local and foreign investment to mining through the
development of clear mining sector policy and straegy, modification of the institutional and legal
framework, provision of better geological information, and strengthening of the Government's
institutional capacity.
5.           The main objectives of the project are to strengthen the capacity of the
Govermnent to attract more investment to the mining sector and to help develop a vibrant
idstry consisting of large as well as small- and medium-scale mines finced with both foreign
and local capital.
6.           The project wi  comprise two main components. The Policy and Strategy
ComponXt will consist of several studies, audits and advisory services to help the Governmt
of Mali design and implement a new policy and strawte for the mining sector. The studies will
cover the legislative, economie, fiscal, institutional, artisanal and environmental aspects of the
mining sector. Implemeion of the segy will Involve restructuring the institutional
framework of the sector, revising the legislation and procedures, and closing and/or selling the
public enterprises and their holdigs in the sector to private investors. Strategy implementation
will also involve strengthenng thfe Ministry of Mines, Hydraulics and Energy through the
provision of a long-term expert, and tran    Government officials in mining finance and
economics, negodatg techniques, metallurgy, and mine management, operation, and technology.
The lnv_tment glumoIoLmn =    fzt will consit ofprovidig consulting services, equiment,
and some works to the Ministry of Mines, Hydraulics and Energy to: (a) organize the
domnion center's information and rehabilitate its facilities; (b) synthesize existing geological
data and improve the geological information system; (c) fill the gaps in the geological,
geochemical and geophysical data coverage of prospective mining areas of the country; and (d)
promote specific mineralized areas to potential investors.
7.           The project will be carried out over 4 years.  It is esfimated to cost
US$6.5 million equivalent net of taxes and duties, wifth a foreign exdcange component of about
US$5.8 million (90%). The fiancing plan includes an IDA credit of US$6.0 million as shown
in SceeA, which will finance all of the foreign exchange costs and some local costs
(UJS$0.24 million eq aent). Amounts and methods of procwement and of disbursements, and
the disbutsement schedule are shown in Scedul B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the stats of Bank Group operations in Mali are ghien in Schedules C and D respectiely.
The Staff Appraial Report for the project is No. 10577-MLI, dated May 18, 1992.



-3-
8.           The Ministry of Mines, Hydraulics and Energy will be responsible for project
Implementtion, assisted by a project coordinaor. The Ministry has had experience with the
implementation of projects financed by IDA, UNDP and other donors with a reasonable amount
of success. It has a pool of well-rained geologists, geophysicists and other technicians. It does
lack financial and o tional management skills, however. The project, therefore, will make
available a long-term consultant to help the Ministry of Mines, Hydrulics and Energy coordinate
project activities.
*~bw W 0|SWNH
9.           To ensure uat activities required for contnued support of sectoral growth are
carried out after project completion, the project will place a strong emphasis on institution-
buflding, human capital development and adequate fiuding of the sector instittions' operating
costs. The project will also take into account the needs and culture of the beneficiaries and make
use of the Malian tradition of consensus-building to achieve lasting policy reforms. This will
involve an analysis of policy alternatives by experts, and the organization of workshops where
these alternatives will be debated by representatives of the various ministries concerned and
interested local leaders before policy options are adopted. The project will also aempt to
demonstate how the mining legislation can recognize and preserve the traditional organization
of arsanal mins while providing the miners with mineral rights.

10.         1Te Mining Sector Capacity-Building Project will be the second project involving
the  nisty of Mines, Hydraulics and Energy. Approved in ApriI 1981, the first project (Credit
1134-MLI) dealt with petroleum exploration promotion and met thc project objectives by
=aacting foreign investment in the evaluation of part of Mali's hydrocarbon potential. (See the
Project Completion Report No. 7908, dated June 30, 1989.) The Ministry has highlighted the
major deficiencies which need to be addressed by the project (including weaknesses in the law,
in the negoating capacity of the Ministry, in the state and exent of the geoiogical information
that could be made readily available to investors, etc.) and has had active input in project
preparation, providing a strong basis for Government ownership of the projec   Extensive
preparation of the project was also done wih the help of expert consultants, and discussions with
the UNDP and with pote  mining investors who have experience in Mali, including IFC.
aone afor JIDA Il      ment
11.          The project fits both IDA's and the Government's strategy to promote sustainable
economic growth in Mali by supporting the development of its natural resources. IDA has
financed a SPPF to assess the importance of arisanal mining and suggest actions to be taken to
assist tha sub-sector in Mali, as well as in the neighboring countries of Burkina Faso, Niger, and
Senegal. The project will involve a range of sensitive policy and strategy issues, in particular,
in the use of a private sector and economic liberalization approach, which has been the center of
Bank/Fund discussions with the Governent of Mali, as well as issues relating to the environment
and alleviaion of rural poverty. It will also complement the proposed Private Sector
Development Project.



-4-
12.          A letter of the Govement's comma ment to prvate sector-led developmem in
the minig sector and a comprehensive taining plan were submitted by the Govermene before
negotaions. Agreement has been reached during negotiation t  acreage will be promptly
made vilable to other investors, once an exploration pemi has expired or If work commitments
hae not been met; at a tansparent and competitive method wfll be put into effect to award
exploaicn and exploitatio permits; that the Govement will take steps toward  itatig the
acquis ion of mineral rits by artisanl miners; and tgat the Govemeat-owned mine, Kalana,
will be sold to private investor. It was also agreed that  e Government will revise and
streamne the institional stucre and procedures for the sector; dat operatig budgets for the
restuctued Institutions will be reviewed at mid-term and adjusted, if necessay; and that the
Govermeat wil desigp and Implement a scheme for retiring excess public service personnel in
the mining sector. In addition, it was agreed that the Government will prepare enomnental,
health and safety regultons and notms, and implement them; and that it wil modify the mining
code and model agreemest to reflect the new mining sector policy and strgy. Agreement has
also been reached durin negotiations Ihat the MMHE will be provided with project countpart
fwnds to be deposid quartedy In an advance revolving fund account; ta a joint IDA and
Governmt annual suprvision meeting will be held, to agree on an annual work program and
budget for the project, as well as a mid-term review. It was dso agreed that a long-term expert
consult_a and her/his support staff be hired to assist MME in projectoordination. Conditions
of effecdveaess Include: (a) that the Government will sign a contract, acceptable to IDA, with
the long-rm  xpert who will be In charge of project coordinaon, and hire basic support stff
to help codne the project; (b) that the cun ar for actrvities to be started withn 6 moths
of project effctiveness will be designated; (c) tha the counterpart funds covering the first quaer
will be depoited in the advace revolving fund account for use by the project; and (d) that
ind       audios, acceptable to IDA, will be appointed who will audk the project's accouns
anually Icincordan  with apropriat auiting principles.
13.          Ara mining in Mali uses very rudimntay medhods that do not raise any
major envionm      iues, however the problems of health and safety risk to miners need to
be addressed. Largescae commercial mining, on the other hand, raises a broad range of
environmenl issues such as land roeamation, and was manment and disposal. The project
will dre these issues by providing techical assistace to establish criteria, install  piate
control    ms, and train pesonnel who will monitor environmena, health and saety
condidons in the mining sector, and safeguard archeological culura property in the minin areas.
A Country En      aStrategy Paper has been completed as a frst step towards a National
E     nvironmentalAcdon Plan, which wil include actions that wil be taken under this project.
14.          The poject will attempt to reduce the counts dependency on the agrcur
and livestock sectors. It will aim at providing support to policy and regulatory reforms ta will
promote private sector growt in the mning inustry and natural resources development.   will
also atempt to Improve ge social and economic status of miers and women, and help reduce
e      wvironmen~ hazards.



1S.          The activities financed by the project wil help strengthen the institutional capacity
In the couy for a sector that has a promising potential. Ihey are also exected to result in
increased foreigp and local investment devoted to mining in Mali in the medium term. Available
geological inormtlon reveals that the country has the potental to increase gold producdon
sipgficantly beyond the 4.3 tonnesit produced in 1990, provided private sector investment is
hcoming   exploration and developmen. (Rog esimates for resultig exports withia the
next 5 to 10 years range from 10 to 15 tomnes of gold per year, whose value would represent
34% to 51% of Mali's total 1990 exports.) There is also a potetal for the prduction of
diaonds. Mining coud thus become an Imotant source of foreign exca', and tax revenue
for Mali's economy. Furthermore, helping artisanal miners, many of whom are women, could
reduce poverty over a large rural population in the western and southern regions of the country.
16.          While the Government has made the commiment to pursue private sector
development, an important project risk involves its implementation by sector institions that
opere in a "governmentcontol" mode. The project is designed to address this concern. There
is also the risk that promotional eforts would not succeed in atcting investors. The sector is
lnown to be of inrest to foreign mining companies, but several potenti investors are holding
back due to WAX\ of confidence in the policy environment and sector istiions. The work on
mining policy, capacity-building, and improvement of geological data will help set the enabling
environment that will lower ihat risk.
_eaodains
17.          I am satisfied that the proposed Credit will comply with the Articles of
A of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the poposed
C;redit.
