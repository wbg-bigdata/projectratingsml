3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
Objectives of the project were to: (i) strengthen the capacity ofthe Government to attract and retain
investment to the mining sector; and (ii) develop a vibrant mining industry composed of large, medium,
and small companies financed with both foreign and local capital.



The objectives are realistic and consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy. However, the design of
the project does not include precise performance indicators to satisfactorily judge attainment of the
objectives.
3.2 Revised Objective:
Not applicable
3.3 Original Components:
The project consisted of two main components: (1) Policy and Strategy Component; and (2) Investment
Promotion Component.
The Policy and Strategy Component included: (a) studies to provide the background information on policy
alternatives and serve as a basis for policy formulation; (b) deliberations on mining policy and strategy; (c)
preparation of mining policy and strategy paper; (d) implementation of institutional and legal reforms; (e)
privatization of public mining enterprises; (f) training; and (g) managerial assistance to the MMHE.
The Investment Promotion Component consisted of providing the Government with management consulting
services, equipment and works to: (a) develop an adequate geological data base; (b) support the
organization and rehabilitation ofthe Documentation Center, which is the Governmenfs repository of
geological data and maps; and (c) assist in organizing a promotion campaign.
Execution of these components is necessary to achieve the objectives of the project. However, the initial
duration of the project (fbur years) was sufficient only to execute the components, not to fully complete the
policy reforms and strengthen government capacity.
3.3 Revised Components:
Early during implementation of the project, the government requested that the
privatization of the Kalana gold mine be accelerated. Accordingly, this sub-component was
excerpted from the overall policy and strategy component and consultant services were bid separately.
This was entirely consistent with the objectives of the project and necessary given the urgent
technical and financial considerations at the state owned mine.
3.4 Quality at Entry:
Quality at entry was unsatisfactory. Even though the objectives of the project were consistent with the
CAS, the government seemed to backtrack from its initial commitment to the objectives during
implementation. This was the result of political uncertainties and continual changes in ministerial
portfolios, which the project design failed to adequately take into account. More time spent in preparation
and, specifically the use of a PPF to fuid some preliminary studies, would have increased govemment
commitment and ownership of the project. Because of these continual changes the government was unable
to articulate a consistent vision for achieving the objectives of the project. This, in turn, led to the
suspension of disbursements for a period of approximately one year during project execution. Also, other
critical risks such as lengthy administrative procedures, lack of adequate capacity in certain critical skill
areas, and the sociological and human difficulties associated with institutional reform, were not adequately
assessed. Even though the risk of deeply ingrained "dirigiste" attitudes hindering achievement of objectives
- 2 -



was recognized in the staff appraisal report, these attitudes were not sufficiently attenuated during project
and remain a hindrance to effective stimulation of private sector mining operations.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Assessment of the achievement of objectives and outputs of this project is difficult and presents a paradox.
Precise performance indicators for outputs and outcomes were not included in the original project
documentation. Just as important, the standards for assessing outcomes have evolved since the project was
designed. Thus, in terms of the standards prevailing at the time of loan approval the outcome of the project
is satisfactory. Of the project's two main objectives, namely, (i) assisting in developing a vibrant mining
industry of large and small firms and, (ii) strengthening government capacity to attract and retain
investment in the sector, the project was instrumental in accomplishing the first and made some important,
but in some respects incomplete, contributions towards the second. However, in terms of the standards
prevailing at the time of this ICR the project outcome is only marginally satisfactory. Projects of this
nature currently put greater emphasis on assessing the economic and sociological impacts of mining on
local communities, reinforcing government institutions to adequately manage mining titles and cadastre,
and building of capacity to enforce environmental regulations. Some important steps were taken during
project execution to address these issues, particularly in respect of the sociological and economic impacts
of mining, but generally these steps were incomplete.
4.2 Outputs by components:
The project did achieve some major outputs such as the national dialogue and subsequent declaration of
mining policy and strategy, studies of social and economic impacts of mining, and an analysis of skills and
training requirements for the sector. Also, after considerable delay, the recommendations prepared by the
project to reform public sector institutions (downsizing and redeployment of personnel) have been endorsed
bythe Council of Ministers. However, in certain other aspects the project has been less successful. In spite
of lengthy and difficult discussions between various government ministries, the mining companies, trade
associations, and the Bank, the fiscal provisions of the new mining law approved by the Council of
Ministers on August 4, 1999 (about one month after the project closed) are, in the opinion of the Bank, at
variance with international best practice. At this writing, the Government and the Bank are reviewing the
impacts that these provisions will have on new investments as well as govermnent revenues. Finally, the
privatization of the Kalana mine remains to be accomplished, though this is due to factors outside of
government control. Early in the project the mine was successfully tendered and privatized to Ashanti
Goldfields. However, the company failed to honor its commitments and the Government was forced to
rescind the privatization award.
4.2.2. Synthesis of Geology Data and Investment Promotion
A major successful outcome is the construction and operation of the documentation center and synthesis of
geology data. The implementation of this component of the project was well over half of the total cost of
the project. The DNGM has assigned new personnel to the center and a small operating budget, though the
long term sustainability of this center remains an issue. The consultants, Kilborn-Tecsult, provided
training support up to project closing. Easy access to this type of earth science information is essential to
attract private sector investors
The project was also instrumental in helping to promote investment and to create a vibrant mining industry.
-3 -



Due to favorable international conditions prevailing in the international mining industry during the 1990s
and the superior quality of already known deposits, gold production from two newly constructed mines plus
artisanal workings increased to 22 metric tonnes in 1998 from a base of around 4 metric tonnes in 1990. In
addition, during the same period, numerous local and foreign companies were actively investing in mineral
exploration on the order of around US$ 20 million per year. The economic impact of the mining sector has
been substantial: the value of gold production is around 5% of the GDP, gold exports now rival cotton
exports, mining accounts for 11% of all modern employment, and contributes 10% of the total government
receipts. In addition, in terms of employment and impacts on local communities, the effects of the mining
industry have been significant and, on the whole, beneficial.
However, the decrease in gold price in the last two years of the project has created an adverse impact on the
mining sector in Mali. Those companies in operation find margins are squeezed and are forced to "high
grade" the deposits which leads to early exhaustion and inefficient use of the resource. Also, and equally
important, there is little incentive at current prices for new exploration and many companies, especially the
small Canadian "juniors", have withdrawn.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Not Applicable
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not Applicable
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The recommendations by consultants concerning institutional reform and redeployment of personnel were
finally adopted by the Council of Ministers in November 1999 after the project had closed. When carried
out, the restructuring will make the supervisory institutions more effective in monitoring developments in
the sector.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Some of the factors outside the government control which favorably influenced project implementation
were: (a) easy availability of risk and equity capital from international capital markets for mineral
exploration and development; (b) favorable change in the perception of risk in Africa on the part of mining
investors; (c) opportunities foreseen by potential investors in exploiting the 'virgin acreage' (unexplored
territory) in Mali. However, as already mentioned in Section 4.2.2, the decrease in gold prices since 1998
will have an adverse impact on Mali's ability to attract and retain new investments.
5.2 Factors generallv subject to government control:
(i) Lack of ownership and commitment. Ownership and commitment to the objectives of the project at
the highest levels were lacking. This resulted in an absence of strategic vision for the sector as is
demonstrated by the time it took (over two years and only seven months before project closure) to approve
the declaration of sector policy and strategy. The ownership factor was complicated, especially in the early
- 4 -



years of the project, by frequent changes of ministers of mines, each one with different approaches and
priorities for the project.
(ii) Political uncertainties. Political uncertainties and turbulence (such as student unrest and opposition
parties contesting the legitimacy of many local elections) that prevailed in Mali in the last two years of the
project distracted the Government and officials from focusing on substantive issues related to the project.
Instead of concentrating on relevant policy reforms and institutional development, the Government had to
divert its attention and efforts to resolve several political crises.
(iii) Lack of coordination between ministries, specifically the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of
Mines. In particular, a common view concerning an internationally competitive mining taxation regime had
not emerged by project closing. This has resulted in fiscal dispositions in the mining law approved by the
Council of Ministers which are not in accordance with international practice. Approval of a fiscal regime
acceptable to the Bank was a condition for release of a tranche in the PAGE program, which closing has
been extended until 30 March 2000 to allow time to find a solution to this problem.
(iv) Differences of opinion between the Bank and the Government. About one and a half years into the
execution of the project the Bank and the Govermment had a difference of opinion concerning the scope of
work in terms of reference for two major components of the project which had already been tendered. The
inability to resolve this difference of opinion led to the suspension of the project and a delay of about twelve
months in project implementation. It was only after the Bank and the Government reached an understanding
on modifying the terms of reference and adjusting the tenders accordingly that the suspension was lifted in
October 1995 and the project picked up momentum.
(v) Bureaucracy in procurement and mobilization of counterpart funds. The bureaucracy in Mali was a
factor that slowed the pace of many activities, especially the procurement process. Because of the tedious
and cumbersome procedure for preparing and approving tender documents, there was a delay of more than
one year in procurement activities and in the overall project implementation. In addition, the Ministry of
Mines was ineffectual in assisting project implementation. During the initial years ofthe project there were
recurring delays in mobilizing counterpart funds; however, this deficiency was subsequently corrected.
(vi) Difficulties in awarding of mining titles. While major investors report few problems with obtaining
mine titles, there is considerable confusion and uncertainty among small mine operators. Since the current
process of awarding mining titles allows for considerable discretionary authority on the part of the Ministry
of Mines the attribution oftitles is slow, arbitrary and not subject to clear guidelines and transparency.
There have been instances of overlapping claims among small operators and allegations of favoritism and
corruption.
(vii) Harassment and arbitrary treatment of investors. Investors (foreign and local) have complained
on several occasions about arbitrary and harassing behavior of government officials, particularly those
involved in tax and customs enforcement. This is in part due to a lack of clarity in investment agreements
and the mining law which leads to differing interpretations by the government officials and mining
companies. There is also a belief by many government officials that the mining sector does not contribute
enough to economic development and that companies are attempting to gain undue advantage. These
disagreements continue to cloud the atmosphere for private mining investment in Mali.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
- 5-



The location of the Project Coordination Unit in a place away from the Ministry of Mines also created a
physical and, more importantly, a psychological detachment between the Ministry and the project
coordination staff. It should be noted that at the time the project coordination offices were established the
building was the only one available. Nonetheless, the physical isolation of the PCU office contributed to
the lack of effective integration into the line Ministry and the National Directorate of Geology and Mining.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
There was a slight cost over-run when calculated in US dollar equivalent due to: i) variation in the
exchange rate between the SDR and US dollar over the course of the project and, ii) the extension of the
closing date and continuance of govemment counterpart contributions.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale fbr sustainability rating:
The sustainability of mining in Mali will remain highly dependent on the prices for gold and other mineral
commodities on international markets. However, this is not the only factor affecting sustainability.
Existing operations must keep their production costs low which can be difficult given the landlocked nature
of the country and long transportation distances to the coastal seaports. Also, the Government must pay
close attention to its international image among existing potential investors. A competitive tax regime,
transparent, unambiguous and clear mining legislation, and an environment free from corruption and
harassment are essential for maintaining private sector investment and increasing the sustainability of the
project.
Even though restructuring of the public institutions of the sector and redeployment of personnel have been
decided by the government, implementing the decision remains to be accomplished. This is particularly true
of Sonarem, the moribund state mining company, which has large numbers of excess employees. Also, it
could be a challenge for the Government to retain the staff in technical specialties who have been trained
with the assistance from the project. These staff could leave the government and join private sector mining
companies offering higher salaries.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The successful transition to regular operations will depend essentially on international market conditions
over which the Government has little control.
The Documentation Center with its digitized database of geology information has been a major
accomplishment of the project and one which is critical to attracting and retaining private sector
investment. Sustainability of this center, however, is dependent on recurrent budgetary support and
adequate recruitment and training of staff. The Government should take steps to ensure that sufficient
budget is available for the center, not only for personnel, but also for training, upkeep and up-dating of
informatics equipment.
As is suggested in the government's own report on project implementation annexed hereto, the Bank should
not reject out-of-hand the idea of a follow-up mining project for Mali. If the government should finally
adopt and implement the new mining law in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, a new project could assist
in solidifying the nascent reforms. Mining is vitally important for Mali's economy. A new project would
have to put emphasis on deepening the legislative and institutional reform process, building capacity,
completing earth science coverage of the country to assist investors, and ensuring adequate consideration of
-6-



environmental and social impacts of mining.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. 1 Lending:
The Bank did not spend sufficient time preparing the project. Use of a Project Preparation Facility (PPF)
could have helped not only to prepare the project but also to create a greater sense of ownership of the
project by the Government and the officials of the various ministries involved. In particular, critical
elements of mining reform should have been tackled during project preparation rather than during project
implementation: the statement of sector policy and modifications to the mining legislation. While the project
design included "homologues" from various ministries during implementation, it would have been more
beneficial to use funds available from a PPF to create a working group of specialists from the Ministries of
Finance, Mines, Environment, and others in the design ofthe project which would have deepened ownership
of the project at the technical level.
The identification of the project duly took into account, and was responsive to, the government's decision to
foster and facilitate private sector mining investment. However, during preparation and appraisal the
assessment of technical aspects such as geographic spread, costs of implementation, availability of
qualified government personnel, and the time required to effect the reforms were not realistically estimated.
More rigorous conditionalities could have been devised, with precise performance indicators, to measure
progress in institutional reform. In this respect, valuable lessons from previous attempts at institutional
reform (Office du Niger, Somiex, OPAM) could have been learned and applied to the institutional reform
component. An implementation manual was apparently not prepared during appraisal which hindered
effective and timely execution of various components, though it is unclear whether such a manual was
required at the time of appraisal. Finally, as noted earlier, certain risks, particularly the political
uncertainties and continual changes in ministerial portfolio, were not properly recognized during appraisal.
7.2 Supervision:
The supervision of the project by the Bank was satisfactory. From December, 1992 to November, 1999
over 22 supervision missions were conducted, an average of two to three missions per year, with an average
stay of two weeks per mission. Initially, most of the missions consisted of onlythe task manager, due
mainly to budgetary constraints. This was however corrected subsequently by the addition of more
members to the supervision team. Aides memoire were regularly prepared and transmitted which alerted the
government to problems with project execution and which suggested remedies in conformance with Bank
procedures. The 590s and the PSRs filed realistically rated the performance of the project both in respect of
achievement of development objectives and project implementation. The supervision team also showed
flexibility. For instance, disbursements were suspended due to the differences of opinion between the Bank
and the newly appointed Minister of Mines concerning the scope and objectives of certain consultant
contracts which had already been bid and awarded. However, substantial dialogue and compromise on
these issues resulted in revisions to the scope of work and the suspension was lifted.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The overall performance of the Bank was satisfactory. Even though the preparation and appraisal of the
project was deficient in certain respects the Bank during execution made some progress to remedy these
deficiencies in consultation with the government. Most of the objectives of the project were achieved even
- 7 -



though there is still dialogue concerning the mining taxation regime.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
In the preparation stage, the Government showed commitment to the objectives ofthe project. The
Government delegated the responsibilities among its sector specialists and prepared the documents in a
format acceptable to the Bank. However, the Govemment did not assign a full-time project coordinator
during project preparation which slowed down progress. Also, it should be noted that the skill mix of the
government personnel assigned to the project was not sufficiently in tune with the project's objectives.
While several geologists worked on project preparation, local specialists experienced in mining law,
taxation, mineral economics, and institutional reform were not assigned. In addition, a broad participatory
approach involving all of the various stakeholders apparently was not used. Therefore, overall project
preparation was not satisfactory.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Government had a good project implementation unit and the day to day implementation of the project
was relatively smooth. However, there were initial problems with mobilizing counter part funds as well as
finding quarters, logistical support, and physical resources required for project implementation. These
factors led to a delay of about twelve months in project implementation.
The Ministry of Mines should have made its views known more clearly to the Bank about the deficiencies
in the original TORs as perceived by it. This would have enabled the Bank to take necessary remedial
measures before the documents were tendered. The Ministry also did not act on major decisions regarding
the project in a timely manner, specifically the declaration of mining policy and strategy, the mining law,
and institutional reform. Lacking central leadership and direction, the enlarged inter-ministerial committees
formed to study various reports and documents were ineffectual and slow to prepare coherent and
consistent documents.
The commitment and enthusiasm of the Government during project preparation seemed to diminish during
project implementation. Frequent changes in ministerial portfolios, particularly in the ministry of mines,
led to a changing vision of the project's goals and how to achieve them. The development of new mines and
the "boom" atmosphere prevailing in mineral exploration during the mid-1990s created a sense of false
security among government officials: why reform the sector when Mali is attracting investment? In spite of
the Letter of Sector Policy from the Government (in the SAR, 1991) confirming its commitment to the
reforms as envisioned in the project, the Government did not see the necessity to pursue vigorously the
reforms as originally committed because of inward investment.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) dealt with procurement, disbursement, auditing, progress reports and
in maintaining proper records of the project in a satisfactory manner. However, there was a lack of
coordination between the National Directorate of Geology and Mines and the PCU. PCU's effectiveness
would have been much better if it had been more filly integrated within line structures of the Ministry of
Mines.
-8 -



7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
The overall performance of the Borrower has been satisfactory in respect of the establishment and
operation of the documentation center and the synthesis and digitalization of existing geology data. This
component of the project is well over 50% of total project cost. However, the Borrower performance in
respect of essential reforms to mining and taxation legislation for the sector is only marginally satisfactory.
Over the life of the project, the Borrower performance has been fluctuating between satisfactory and
unsatisfactory as is evidenced by the rating on development objectives and performance of various 590s
and PSRs.
8. Lessons Learned
(i) PPF should be used in project preparation to build ownership of the project and to establish the project
coordination unit so there is no delay in project implementation.
(ii) All hard conditionalities, such as approval of the letter of sector policy, mining and taxation reforms,
and institutional restructuring plans should be accomplished during project preparation and before project
approval and/or effectiveness. This would lead to faster project implementation.
(iii) Senior level commitment to the objectives of the project and inter-ministerial coordination are crucial
for success. In addition, the government should ensure a proper skill mix for project preparation and
appraisal. Finally, the time and resources required to carry out reforms and to deepen them needs to be
realistically assessed.
(iv) Effective integration of the PCU into the line Ministry is important for smooth project implementation.
(v) The Bank should build into the procurement procedures mechanisms to facilitate greater use of the
services of local consulting firms and individual national consultants during project preparation and
implementation.
(vi) Reforms in the mining sector (or any other sector, for that matter) will be not be effective without the
Government's commitment to, and effective implementation of, transparent governance.
(vii) For dealing with issues beyond the mining sector, such as legislative, regulatory, and organizational
issues, it would be very useful to bring into the project team experts from other ministries as well as from
other organizations at the early stage of the project. Selection of a strong and dynamic country project
team leadership is essential in this regard.
(viii) In order for Mali to be competitive in the global market, staff working in the mining sector should be
kept informed in a timely manner on the market dynamics, best practices, bench marks and other related
matters. Site visits outside Mali, holding regular conferences on mining sector and other measures would
enable them to keep abreast of the trends in the world mining sector. Institutions like the World Bank would
be able to play a major role to achieve this goal.

Overall Macro-Economic Context of the Project
The project was in full support of the macro-economic context prevailing in Mali during the early 1990s -
the program of structural adjustment, macro-economic and institutional reforms undertaken by the
government. Specifically, the mining project had the objectives to reform and reinforce the sector
institutions and the promotion of private mining investment. Specific tasks of the project included: the
privatizing the Kalana gold mine, reforming sector institutions and re-deploying personnel in state
institutions, cleaning-up the mining title situation, preparing a new mining policy and strategy, drafting of a
new mining law with a new fiscal regime for the mining sector, producing environmental reforms,
synthesizing existing geological information and setting-up a documentation center, and training of sector
personnel.
The original project closure date of 30 June 1997 was extended by two years to 30 June 1999 to allow
completion of key tasks which had been delayed.
Conception and Implementation of the Project
The identification phase of the project was weak in certain aspects, notably under-estimating requirements
for geological coverage and mapping, not taking sufficiently into account national expertise and
requirements for training, and lack of provision for recurrent costs occasioned by the institutional reform.
Principal Results Achieved by Component
Concerning the privatization of the Kalana mine, the mining company [Ashanti Goldfields], which acquired
the mine, failed to respect the conditions of the tender and a new international tender for the mine was
launched in July, 1999.
Conceming the execution of the "policy and strategy" component of the project, certain weaknesses are
noted concerning: i) lack of concrete proposals on legal and financial assistance to small scale and artisanal
mining; ii) insufficient comparative fiscal studies; iii) non-preparation of environmental norms and
directives; iv) not taking into account certain pre-occupations in the original terms of reference; and v)
insufficient involvement of the technical structures and counterparts.
Concerning the "institutional reform" component of the project, a proposal for reforms from the consultants
was made but an ad-hoc group from the Ministry of Mines and Energy was required to adapt the proposal
to the legal and regulatory requirements of public institutions in Mali. Other weaknesses noted during the
execution of this component include insufficient involvement of the technical structures and lack of a
preliminary diagnostic study of the existing institutions.
Conceming the "geological synthesis" and the "documentation center" components of the project, most of
the specific tasks of these components were realized. However, the components suffered from insufficient
involvement of counterparts during all phases of the work and insufficient training provided to the
counterparts.

Lessons Learned
Lessons learned include: i) the necessity to take into account the continuity of the project through
additional sources of adequate financing; ii) the desirability of domiciling the project within the technical
structures responsible for the sector, giving the project coordination unit a certain management autonomy;
iii) better involvement of local personnel in the consultants studies; iv) providing for audits of the
performance of the firms which win the tenders for privatization; v) greater continuity and direct
involvement of the consultants through an office in the country as well as involvement of local
counterparts; vi) providing for more time and equipment for the synthesis of geological infornation; and
vii) providing a precise program for training and execute through the project coordinator and the technical
structures.
Development Impact
Because of the delays in the execution of the project, it is not possible to measure the development impacts
of the project, even in an experimental fashion. However, it is noted that interest in the gold mining sector
in Mali continues with foreign investors.
Sustainability
The sustainability of the project is good with respect to the mining policy and strategy, institutional reform
(provided that the problem of carrying out the reforms is solved) and the documentation center (assuming
recurrent operating budget can be found).
Bank. Government and Consultant Performance
In spite of the weaknesses during project identification and preparation (as noted previously), the Bank's
performance with respect to supervision was satisfactory and could be considered good. However, this
perfornance could have been improved if the Bank had readjusted the amounts of the credit after revision
of the terms of reference. Also, the suspension of disbursements of the project led to delays in execution.
An evaluation of the government's performance during the project reveals insufficient taking into account
human resource needs and national expertise. Also, during the project implementation the government's
complex administrative procedures led to delays. A weakness noted in the performance of the consultants
is that they were not sufficiently involved enough in the national policy dialogue, did not complete certain
necessary studies, did not involve counterparts enough, and did not obtain access to all of the information
which reflected negatively on the quality of the draft mining legislation and recommendations for
institutional reform.
Lessons to be Learned
The principal lesson to be learned is that of a larger cooperation between the Bank and the Government
during project preparation and appraisal in order to prepare a consensual project appraisal document.
Additionally, in order to avoid confusion and changes to project scope the technical services of Mines and
Finance should furnish all documents and information required for consultation. The consultants should
involve in a more effective manner the national counterparts. During the preparation phase, the project
should take measures to ensure that recurrent costs after the project are taken into account, notably those
occasioned by the institutional restructuring and the documentation center. Finally, training should be more
precisely formulated, taking into account weaknesses in human resources.

Perspective of a New Project
The project has accomplished certain basic foundations for mining sector development: the mining code, the
documentation center, and the final modalities of institutional reforn. A new mining project should be
prepared, with the help of the Bank, to render operational the results obtained during the present project.
The government will be discussing this possibility within the framework of the Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS). The new project would: i) implement the new mining law and institutional reform as well as
reinforce human capacity; ii) sustain the documnentation center through up-dates of existing geological
information and acquisition of new geological data to ensure a geochemical and geophysical coverage of the
country at a scale of 1/200,000 and an inventory of mineral potential; iii) operationalize promotion of
private sector investment; iv) define a monitoring system for the miining sector; v) establish environmental
norms for the sector; and vi) develop small scale and artisanal mining.
Conclusions
In concluding, t,he government has in place essential elements to promote mining sector development
including the legal, institutional and technical frameworks to mobilize private investment, and the various
public services with the role of orientation and monitoring. Nonetheless, it will be necessary to call upon
outside resources, specifically those of the World Bank, to put into place a new project to solidify the
results achieved by the present project. The eventuality of a second mining project is more evident given
the limited objectives and resources of the first, given the fact that at the time the first project was prepared,
mining activities were little developed in the country.
