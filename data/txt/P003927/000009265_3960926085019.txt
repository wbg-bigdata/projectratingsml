MEMORANXDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN OF US$234 MILLION
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR AN IRRIGATION SUBSECTOR PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to the Republic of Indonesia
for US$234 million equivalert is presented for approval.  The loan would have
a term of 20 years, including 5 years' grace, at the standard variable
interest rate, and would assist the Government of Indonesia's (aOI) efforts to
establish the resource allocation, cost recovery and institutional capacity to
expand and sustain its irrigation systems.
2.        Background.  The large expansion of irrigation infrastructure over
last two decades has been impressive and has made a major contribution to
Indonesia's transition from the world's largest importer of rice to a position
of self-sufficiency. This successful expansion, however, was not accompanied
by a balanced effort to maintain and operate efficiently much of the
4.8 million ha of irrigation systems. Consequently, many systems once
developed are poorly maintained and, unless there is a radical shift of focus
towards operations and maintenance (O&M), a massive expenditure on
rehabilitation in the next 10-15 years would become inevitable. The
recognition of the importance of O&M, coming at the same time as Indonesia is
reaching the threshold of rice self-sufficiency and facing severe resource
constraints, is leading to a redirection of GOI's priorities away from
expansion and modernization of specific irrigation systems, towards
efficiently operating and maintaining existing systems, and the completion of
priority ongoing projects.
3.        Project Objectives.  The project: would be the first phase of a long-
term program aimed at supporting a Subsector Policy Statement issued by GOI
and setting out Government's intention to: (a) sustain the effectiveness of
all irrigation systems through adequate levels of fundin-, and strengthening
of institutions and procedures for O&M planning and implementation;
(b) introduce direct cost recovery from irrigation beneficiaries and increase
local revenue generation to place maintenance responsibilities more clearly on
farmers and provincial authorities and thus reduce the burden of O&M
expenditures on official budgets, particularly that of the Central Government;
and (c) rationalize existing and programmed investments in the subsector.
4.        Project Description.  Predicated upon, and within the framework of,
a medium-term Policy Statement and an agreed Action Plan of specific measures
to be taken over the three year project implementation period, the project
would consist of tuie following: (a) special maintenance works (i.e., deferred
maintenance and minor upgrading) on about 400,000 ha of irrigated land, about
106,000 ha of reclaimed swampland, and five river mouths. Detailed
preparation and design work would also be undertaken for about 200,000 4a of
irrigated areas and 55,500 ha of swamps requiring special maintenance to be
covered in the first year of a follow-up project; (b) systematic introduction
of efficient O&M on about 700,000 ha of irrigated land and 87,000 ha of
swampland; (c) completion of about 40 priority GOI-funded ongoing projects
selected on the basis of agreed technical and economic criteria; (d) pilot



-2-
groundwater development through construction of some 900 tubewells for small
farmers in primarily rainfed areas; (e) support for GOI's policy reforms in
the subsector, including privatization of small public irrigation schemes, a
pilot scheme to test and implement alternative ways to introduce direct
i-rigation servie.3 fees, and improved local revenue generation via land
reclassification and valuation; (f) support for institutional strengthening
and training, including O&M manpower planning and development, and strengthen-
ing of the central, provincial and district level institutions responsible for
irrigation O&M, and of water users' associations (WUAs); and (g) technical
assistance and studies (institutional strengthening study, investment strategy
study, a:id environmental impact studies) in support of the above components.
5.        The total project cost is estimated to be about US$359.1 million
equivalent, including estimated taxes and duties of US$18.5 million equivalent
and estimated direct and indirect foreign exchange costs equivalent to
US$148 million (41Z of the total project cost). The proposed Bank loan of
US$234 million equivalent (69? of project costs, excluding taxes and duties)
would cover costs of civil works, equipment and supplies (including vehicles),
technical assistance, training, studies, mapping, surveys and related
materials and travel, needed to implement the project components (details are
given in Schedule A). The Government of Netherlands is expected to finance a
part of the costs of training, institutional strengthening study, and civil
works to be undertaken for special maintenance and efficient O&M. The latter
would be under joint financing arrangements with the Bank   The Government of
Italy is expected to finance technical assistance and eqt.pment for part of
the groundwater development component, and the Ford Foundation to finance
technical assistance for the implementation of the turnover of small irriga-
tion systems. Total external financing would amount to 69X of overall project
costs (including taxes). GOI will finance the remaining 31% of project costs,
covering taxes and duties, costs of land acquisition rnd a part of the costs
of the investment strategy study, maintenance of present levels of country-
wide irrigation O&M expenditures over the project period, and a progressively
larger share of incremental O&M expenditures in project areas. Disbursements
would be made against contracts, except for minor works executed on force
account, small civil works contracts valued at less than US$300,000 each, and
the costs of training, which would be disbursed against statements of expendi-
ture. All local currency payments would be disbursed through a Special
Account to be established in Bank Indonesia, and the contracts procured under
international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures would be paid at the option
of GOI, either from the Special Account or by normal disbursement procedures
(direct payments, reimbursements, and special commitment). Civil works
packages larger than US$3 million, totalling US$30 million, and equipment and
materials amounting to US$15.3 million would be procured through ICB. The
consultancy services (US$45 million), with the exception of those needed for
detailed designs of special maintenance works and ongoing projects, and those
grant-financed by cofinanciers, would be procured internationally in accor-
dance with Bank guidelines. The detailed designs would be carried out through
local subcontracts under the supervision of consultants. Procurement and dis-
bursement arrangements are summarized in Schedule B. The project would be
implemented through the existing DGWRD/PRIS organization, with appropriate
technical assistance provided as necessary. Overall project monitoring and
review would be provided by a Project Coordinating Unit under the Assistant



- 3 -
Director General of DCWRD, assisted by three internationally recruited consul-
tants (with experience in O&M, design, and planning respectively). To monitor
implementation of the Policy Statement, Action Plan and the institutional and
investment studies, the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) would
coordinate with the Ministries of Public Works, Home Affairs, Finance, and
Agriculture. This inter-agency group would provide overall policy guidance
and coordination. Staff Appraisal Report No. 6813-IND is being distributed
separately. A timetable of key preparation events is given in S^hedule C, and
the status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia in Schedule D. A map of
Indonesia is also attached.
6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The subsector approach proposed
under the project would provide a critically needed national approach to O&M,
widen the development impact of the Bank's assistance by reinforcing the shift
in responsibility for O&M funding and implementation from central to provin-
cial authorities and to ultimate beneficiaries, further strengthen the insti-
tutions responsible for irrigation policy and resource allocation, prevent
deterioration of the substantial irrigation infrastructure, increase the
productivity of completed investments, and help develop a future investment
strategy in the subsector. In view of its past and ongoing involvement in the
subsector and GOI's readiness to act upon significant subsector reform issues,
the Bank can assist GOI in designing relevant subsector policies and institu-
tional adjustments. The lessons drawn from the project performance audit
reports, namely, the need to improve O&M services, promote efficient water
use, provide support to WUAs, and improve cost recovery (particularly through
direct charges) have been incorporated in the planning and design of the
proposed project.
7.        Actions Agreed.  GOI has recently issued the subsector Policy
Statement and Action Plan, approved by all the concerned ministries (Finance,
Agriculture, Public Works, Home Affairs and BAPPENAS). The project will be
implemented in accordance with this Policy Statement and the Action Plan,
reviewed and agreed with the Bank. GOI has established the inter-agency group
at the national level to coitdinate and monitor the Policy Statement and
Action Plan, and furnished the Bank with evidence that the 1987/88 budget
covers the fiscal year 1987/88 project expenditures and maintains at least the
1986/87 budget level for O&M in real terms for the entire irrigated area in
Indonesia. Some of the key actions (outlined in the 3-year Action Plan) to be
implemented are: (a) small systems of less than 150 ha in size, covering an
area of 20,400 ha, would be privatized (turned over to WUAs) over the three-
year period, at least two systems of about 500 ha size would be turned over,
and a nationwide program prepared by September 30, 1990 for turnover of
systems larger than 150 ha; (b) collection of irrigation service fee in the
pilot areas (a total of 125,000 ha) would commence in December 1988, and
agreed administrative and judicial arrangements (as found to be workable in
pilot areas) would be established by January 31, 1990, for its extension to
other areas; (c) budgetary procedurrs and accounts would be simplified by
June 30, 1988 and new systems and procedures for O&M programming and budget
planning implemented from FY89190 onwards; (d) investments in the irrigation
subsector would be rationalized and a strategy for the Fifth Five Year Plan
prepared; (e) appropriate measures for malaria control would be taken and
these measures would take environmental and health aspects into consideration;



- 4 -
and (f) the agreed timetables for, inter alia, training, studies, and land
reclassification/valuation would be implemented. Annual budgetary
allocations, which at least maintain the 1986/87 level of total country-wide
irrigation O&M financing, in real terms, provision of evidence that
satisfactory actual expenditures for country-wide irrigation O&M were made
during the previous fiscal year, and a progressively larger share of
incremental financing for O&M in the project areas, would be a condition of
continued loan disbursements.
8.        Justification.  An efficient operation of the existina capital stock
(in irrigation infrastructure), expediting the completion of priority on-going
projects, striking an appropriate balance between expenditures on new invest-
ments and O&M of the existing investments, and reducing the dependence on
central government budgets for O&M funding via improved cost recovery and
local revenue generation, would all contribute towards sustained development
of the irrigation subsector. The project has an ERR of 21X, that is rela-
tively insensitive to cost overruns and reduced benefits, but a two-year delay
in implementation would reduce the ERR to 17%.
9.        Risks.  The principal risks are that:  (a) project implementation
may be delayed; (b) the level of funding allocated for efficient O0M may be
inadequate; (c) the funds provided may be inefficiently utilized; and
(d) implementation of the short-term measures included in the Action Plan may
be prolonged by the difficulties of policy and institutional change which
involve several different GOI ministries and organizations. However, GOI's
commitment, as reflected in its Policy Statement and Action Plan, indicates
its willingness to address O&M requirements on a country-wide basis. Risks
are also expected to be minimized by the proposed long-term program approach,
the provision for substantial technical sssistance, and by the steps already
taken by GOI to appoint key consultants and to have the salient organizational
arrangements for project implementation in place.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
