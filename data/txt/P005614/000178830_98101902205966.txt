REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA FOR THE TUNIS DISTRICT URBAN
PLANNING AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
for the equivalent of US$11 million and a proposed development credit for the
equivalent of US$7 million to the Republic of Tunisia to help finance the Tunis
District urban planning and public transport project. The loan would have a
term of 22 years, including four years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 per-
cent per annum. The development credit would be on standard IDA terms. Of
the total proceeds of the loan and credit amounting to $18 million, about
$16.5 million would be re-lent to the Societe Nationale des Transports (SNT)
for 22 years, including four years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent
per annum. The balance of about $1.5 million would be used partly to fi-
nance technical assistance and partly to finance equipment and civil works
for the traffic improvement program of the Municipality of Tunis. Technical
assistance to the District of Tunis under the project would be financed joint-
ly by the UNDP and by the Bank loan and IDA credit.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Tunisia" (EMA-51a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on August 14,
1972. A basic economic mission visited Tunisia in February and March 1973
and is now preparing its report. Some of its preliminary conclusions are
reflected below. A Country Data Sheet (Annex I) and a map of Tunisia are
attached.
3.        Tunisia's development has been hampered by scarcity of natural re-
sources. Much of the country is arid or semi-arid, and agriculture is highly
dependent on rainfall.  Minerals, particularly phosphates, are mostly of low
quality and limited volume. Industrial development has been handicapped by
the small size of the domestic market; in most sectors a lack of skills and
experience is a constraint. Fortunately, petroleum was discovered in the
mid-sixties and has since become a limited but valuable source of revenue.
4.        In the 1960's, development policies favored centralized decision-
making and assigned a major role to the public sector. Over the period 1962-
1970, the growth of GDP at market prices averaged 5.1 percent per year. It
did not reach the target figure of 6 percent, largely due to a series of dry
years, to a Government investment policy which emphasized social and admin-
istrative infrastructure and projects which yielded contributions to growth
only slowly, to a number of uneconomic investments in public enterprises, and



to the discouragement of private initiative in nearly all sectors except
tourism. In two sectors performance was clearly unsatisfactory: agricul-
ture, which grew by only 2.3 percent per year, and food processing, which
fell by 2.4 percent over the period. In most other sectors performance was
close to planned levels. Growth in tourism, petroleum and, to a lesser ex-
tent, textiles largely exceeded targets, but public manufacturing enterprises
yielded disappointing results.
5.        In terms of macro-economic aggregates, some results are nonetheless
impressive. Between 1961 and 1972, annual investments tripled from TD 69 mil-
lion to TD 207 million. Fixed investment averaged 21 percent of GDP over the
period. Domestic savings rose from 11 percent of GDP to 21 percent. The bal-
ance of payments has steadily improved since 1967; the deficient on current
account, which had averaged $115 million per year between i362 and 1967, dropped
to $69 million in 1972. A traditional net liability of foreign exchange re-
serves was reversed in 1970; net holdings increased to $190 million by the
end of 1972, covering six months of commodity imports.
6.        Improvements in welfare have been less adequate.   Reliable informa-
tion on employment and income distribution is not available but there is some
evidence of growing regional disparities in income, imbalance in the pattern
of land ownership and concentration of economic activity in the urban areas.
Unemployment is estimate_.' at 14 percent of the adult labor force, under-
employment at a further 29 percent. Even with a growing number of emigrant
workers, job creation through past investment has not kept pace with the
growth in the adult labor force. Given the high annual rate of population
increase (2.5-2.8 percent per year) from 1962-70 the growth in overall per
capita income was less than 2.5 percent per annum; overall private consump-
tion per capita barely increased.
7.        Recognizing the shortcomings of many past policies, the Government
introduced a new development strategy in 1970. Its main objectives are to
increase production (especially for export) and employment, and to achieve
this mainly by encouraging private initiative, reducing direct Government
involvement in production and relaxing the administrative regulation of
the economy. The Government has reduced import restrictions on spare parts
and raw materials for domestic manufacturers. Approval procedures for new
investments have been considerably eased, and banks will be given more re-
sponsibility in allocating investment funds.   The Government has undertaken
a thorough review of the tax system, including customs tariffs, and is now
introducing a number of further reforms designed to stimulate production,
encourage exports and achieve greater equity and simplicity in administrative
procedures. These developments have led to a sharp rise in private invest-
ment.
8.        In the past few years there has been a remarkable improvement in
the economic situation. GDP grew by 8 percent in 1970, 9 percent in 1971
and 18 percent in 1972. The turn-around in performance can be attributed
to: la) exceptionally good weather for agriculture; (b) an increase in
olive production; (c) continued rapid growth of tourism; (d) increased



- 3 -
production and export of petroleum, reinforced by important international
price increases in 1972; (e) rapid growth in workers' remittances from
abroad, which increased from $9 million in 1965 to $70 million in 1972; and
(f) the accelerated growth in private investment stemming from renewed self-
confidence in the private sector as a result of the new Government policies
and increased emphasis on productivity and profitability.
9.        Most of the above favorable factors may last throughout the Fourth
Tunisian Plan (1973-1976), which has reached an advanced state of preparation.
The Plan is built around the objective of attaining a rate of growth in GDP
sufficient to provide a 6 percent increase in private consumption while satis-
fying constraints on the balance of payments and debt service. It proposes
a 20 percent limit on external financing of investment and a 20 percent limit
on the debt service ratio. As a subsidiary objective, the Plan seeks the crea-
tion of new employment opportunities to meet as far as possible the expected
increase in the labor force. It calls for continued rapid economic growth,
with GDP increasing by 7 percent per year over the exceptionally high level
of 1972, and a virtual doubling of the investment effort. In formulating its
strategy, the Government has placed overriding emphasis on the role of the
non-agricultural industrial sector as the primary source of growth and the
principal field for employment creation.
10.       The Government's proposals for financing the Plan include tax re-
form, and further measures to improve the performance and profitability of
State enterprises and to mobilize resources in the private sector. Exports
of goods and services are projected to grow at 8.3 percent per year and im-
ports at 9.7 percent. The resulting average trade deficit of some $113 mil-
lion, plus $73 million for debt amortization, would be more than offset by
a projected annual inflow of external aid of $242 million. These assump-
tions would imply a debt service ratio of about 15 percent over the next
four years provided private borrowing from abroad remains limited.
11.       Agriculture, the dominant sector in the economy, provides nearly
half of the employment, 30 percent of merchandise exports and 17 percent of
GDP. Food processing industries account for another 5 percent of GDP and
over a third of value added in manufacturing. The stagnation in agriculture
in the 1960's (see para. 4) can be attributed to (a) adverse weather condi-
tions; (b) the disruptive effects of the effort to extend the cooperative
program, which led to major changes in the direction of agricultural policy;
and (c) the stress on investments that are productive only in the long run.
The Government is now slowly devising a new agricultural development strategy,
although its approach so far remains fragmentary.
12.       A more desirable pattern of public investments in agriculture could
include efforts to utilize intensive agricultural production techniques more
widely; to make more effective use of land through application of existing
land reform legislation and land reallocation to small-scale farmers; to ex-
pand livestock and forage production; to improve marketing institutions and
the quality and availability of the extension service; and to stress rural
development.



- 4 -
13.       Up to 1969, manufacturing, which contributes about 15 percent to
GDP, focussed primarily on import substitution by state enterprises and proc-
essing of minerals for export. Recent import liberalization has given larger
scope to private iritiative and should help foster domestic competition. Fur-
thermore, legislation providing substantial incentives for domestic and foreign
investment in export-oriented industries has recently been passed. There ap-
pear to be good prospects for foreign investment.
14.       During the Fourth Plan industrial growth is likely to be concen-
trated in the petroleum, phosphate and textile sectors. The increase in
phosphate production by opening up new deposits is to be accompanied by
measures to rehabilitate and improve the profitability of existing mines.
Beyond this, progress in expanding indulstrial production will depend largely
on the Government's ability to organize a strong promotional effort, to mo-
bilize foreign and domestic participation in new ventures, and to provide
incentives to reorganize and rationalize existing plants.
15.       The development of tourism is a recent phenomenon.   The prospects
for continued rapid expansion are bright, and plans have been laid to increase
hotel capacity accordingly. The Government actively supports such expansion
through incentives to private hotel promoters and has recently embarked on a
long-term tourism infrastructure program, financed with the assistance of the
Bank Group and KfW.   The Iajor constraints to the sector's expansion are the
speed at which hotel capacity can be developed and an adequate, trained labor
force can be made available to the industry.
16.       Since 1962, Tunisia has benefitted from a high level of external
official aid, principally from countries and international institutions par-
ticipating in the Consultative Group for Tunisia sponsored by the Bank. Dur-
ing 1963-1972, external aid amounted to about $957 million (in terms of dis-
bursements) of which 32 percent was in grants, including foodstuffs and tech-
nical assistance, and 68 percent in loans. The major donors have been the
United States, France, Germany, Canada, Sweden and other EEC countries.    Of-
ficial loans have come from bilateral sources for 87 percent (mainly the
United States, France, Germany, Italy and Kuwait) and from multilateral
sources for 13 percent (primarily the World Bank Group and the African De-
velopment Bank). Program loans represented 40 percent of total disburse-
ments, and project loans 60 percent; the largest share of project loans was
for irrigation infrastructure, transport, communications and tourism. Most
aid has been obtained on concessionary terms: from 1967-1972, the average
terms of borrowing from bilateral sources were 2.3 percent interest and 27
years to maturity, including 9.1 years of grace; from multilateral sources
5.4 percent interest and 28 years to maturity, including 5.9 years of grace.
Borrowing on conventional terms from private sources by Government or by
private enterprises with a Government guarantee, amounted to about $400
million over the decade; it took the form of suppliers' credits (mainly
French) and loans by private banks (mainly Italian and French); from 1967-
1972, average terms were 6.0 percent interest and 9 years to maturity. There
was virtually no other external private borrowing.



- 5 -
17.       Despite the favorable terms on which Tunisia has received external
assistance, the country's debt burden is relatively high. Total outstanding
external public debt at the end of 1972 was about TD 490 million ($1,020 mil-
lion), equivalent to 48 percent of GDP. Of this, $195 million (19 percent)
was owed to the Bank Group, including $135 million (13 percent) to the Bank.
Of the Tunisian total of $96 million in service payments on external public
debt in 1972, $6.2 million (6.8 percent) was paid to the Bank Group, includ-
ing $6.0 million (6.6 percent) to the Bank. If present trends continue, as
expected, the share of the Bank Group in Tunisia's external public debt will
be about 20 percent, including 14 percent for the Bank, by the end of the
Fourth Plan in 1976, while the share of the Bank Group iin annual debt serv-
ice will rise to about 16 percent, including 15 percent for the Bank. The
share of the Bank Group in total disbursements on public debt is expected
to rise to about 27 percent from 1973-1976, compared to 19 percent in 1968-
1972.
18.       The maturity structure and terms of Tunisia's debt have improved
continuously since 1969, when the Government started to limit borrowing from
private sources; the proportion of outstanding debt at the end of 1971 was
60 percent from Government (62 percent in 1968), 17 percent from multilateral
sources (11 percent in 1968), and 23 percent from private sources (27 percent
in 1968). The debt service ratio declined from 26.7 percent in 1968 to 17.2
in 1972. Under the Fourth Plan the Government intends to keep the ratio of
external debt to GDP below 50 percent. Moreover, in future the Government
plans to be more selective in external borrowing and to give preference to
project aid over program aid. But, as is indicated above, overall aid re-
quirements remain high.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
19.       Beginning with a credit of $5 million for an education project in
1962, Tunisia has to date received a total of fifteen Bank loans and nine IDA
credits amounting to, respectively, $155.6 million and $58.7 million, net of
cancellations and refundings. The proposed loan and credit would raise the
total of Bank and IDA assistance from $214.3 million to $232.3 million.
20.       While the present operation would be the first project specifically
emphasizing urban transport, the largest share of Bank Group lending has been
for transport. Two lending operations for port construction, one for the na-
tional railway company, one for road construction and one for a gas pipeline
account for 30 percent of present Bank/IDA commitments in Tunisia. Industrial
and hotel financing through the Societe Nationale d'Investissement (SNI) come
second (22 percent), followed by public utilities (17 percent), tourism infra-
structure (11 percent), agriculture and fisheries (9 percent) education (9
percent), and family planning (2 percent).
21.       While there have been problems in project execution, as in the co-
operative farms and family planning projects, on the whole project implemen-
tation has been satisfactory. Important institutional improvements have been



achieved. In the transport and public utilities sectors, independent agencies
and public corporations have been significantly strengthened. The Turisian
development finance company, SNI, has been placed on a sound footing.
22.       IFC has invested in a fertilizer plant, in SNI, in COFITOUR (a com-
pany to promote and invest in tourism projects) and in RYM (a large hotel de-
velopment). In addition it has recently made a $39,000 equity investment in
a promotional company "Sousse Nord"; this company is to prepare plans for an
integrated tourism resort development in the Sousse area, one of the areas in
which tourism infrastructure is being financed jointly by the Bank, IDA and
KFW. IFC's net commitments iri Tunisia presently total $13.5 million.
23.       In the early years of cooperation with Tunisia, Bank Group lending
primarily aimed at support of the Government's policy of emphasizing long-term
investments in infrastructure. In keeping with the changes in the Government's
economic policies and development strategy described in Part I of this report,
current and future operations stress imnediately productive investment in in-
dustry, tourism and agriculture, with emphasis on projects increasing foreign
exchange earnings and employnent.
24.       In agriculture, Bank Group assistance is expected to help to put to
full use existing irrigation infrastructure in the Nebhana and Medjerda areas
through financing of on-farm investment programs, and associated extension and
marketing services. The Bank Group will also assist the Government in its en-
deavors to improve rural living and employment conditions and to discourage
rural-urban migration through projects for livestock and rural development
in the Sedjenane area of Northern Tunisia and for rural development in Cen-
tral Tunisia. Continued support of industrial and hotel credit through loans
to SNI should help to build up the country's foreign exchange earning capacity
and help the Government to increase employment opportunities in industry and
tourism. A separate tourism training project is also in preparation. Finally,
projects in phosphate production in the South, and for urban sewerage in Tunis
are planned for the next two years. IFC has under consideration a large proj--
ect to produce and market poultry locally and a project to manufacture alumi-
num fluoride from local fluorspar.
PART III - URBAN PLAYNING AND TRANSPORT IN TUNIS
The Tunis Metropolitan Area
25.       Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, is the country's principal concen-
tration of population, employment and economic activity. Metropolitan Tunis
accounts for more than half the country's total commerce and trade, construc-
tion, and administrative and ,thE.r white collar Jobs. Rapid urbanization has
characterized the area in recent ,,ears, but the full thrust of urbanization
has not yet overtaken the city. En 1956, the year of Independence, 400,000
people lived in the area; by the m:iddle of 1972 this figure had more than
doubled to about 900,000. By 1976, the population, which is growing at



-7-
about 5 percent per year, is expected to reach 1.2 million. The Municipal-
ity of Tunis, with some 558,000 inhabitants, is the largest of the thirteen
communes composing the Tunis District, a regional governmental body recently
established to coordinate metropolitan public investment planning and devel-
opment.
26.       The location of the central city between two bodies of water, the
Lake of Tunis to the east and the Sebkha de Sedjoumi to the west, has strongly
influenced Tunis' settlement pattern. The ancient Medina, or walled city,
with its extremely high population density (comparable to Bombay and Calcutta)
constitutes the core of the city. The modern city, constructed on a grid
street pattern in the 19th and 20th centuries, occupies the rest of the area
between the two lakes. Middle and high income residential areas have grown
principally to the north and northeast of the neck of land between the lakes,
industrial zones to the south.
Urban Planning in Tunis
27.       The tendency towards dispersal of residential development and em-
ployment zones created by the city's location has been strengthened by the
inadequacy of the planning and institutional framework for dealing with the
area's problems. Ministries and decision-making are highly centralized on
a sectoral basis, and inter-ministerial coordination on investments affect-
ing the growth and development of metropolitan Tunis is weak. Individual
ministries and agencies tend to follow the narrowly conceived demands of
their particular responsibilities, and not to take the implications of their
programs for the activities of other public bodies adequately into account.
28.       The Government has recently begun to view the absence of effective
planning and the pattern of Tunis' development with concern. In 1972, it
took an essential initial step by setting up the Tunis District, designed to
create an institutional structure within which the area's development could
be seen and guided as a whole. The principal task of the District is to plan,
coordinate and supervise public investments at the metropolitan level. The
staff falls under the authority of the Governor-Mayor of Tunis; a Board of
local representatives chaired by the Governor-Mayor and a ministerial-level
Council chaired by the Prime Minister exercise supervisory and decision-
making responsibility.
29.       Establishment of the District constitutes a major step towards de-
centralization and sets a precedent for the eventual regionalization of pub-
lic administration in Tunisia. Such fundamental change cannot easily be put
into effect and practical measures are only now being taken to establish a
staff and make the District operational. When it reaches its full effec-
tiveness, the District is to have a major role in planning the public in-
vestment program for the Tunis area, in preparing the state capital budget
for Tunis and in supervising the execution of projects. Agreement was reached
during negotiations on a draft decree concerning the District's organization,
staffing, financial authority and relations with other agencies; issuance of
the decree is a condition of effectiveness. Agreement was also reached on
the establishment of a technical coordinating committee for the District



bringing together decision-making level representatives of the interested
ministries and public corporations.
30.       The District will have three directorates, responsible respectively
for planning and studies, programming and the public investment budget, and
supervision. In close cooperation with the ministries and other public
agencies concerned, the Planning and Studies Directorate will prepare meciium
and long term development plans for the District. It will examine fiscal and
.-inancial problems, as well as other public policy issues, concerning the de-
velopment of the Tunis area. Before any commitment to an investment project
in the area is made by a ministry, a commune, or, when a state grant is re-
quired for its realization, by a public corporation, the Planning and Studies
Directorate will review the project. The Planning and Studies Directorate
will also initiate and prepare specific investment projects through its own
staff or with the assistance of consu'ltants.
31.       The Directorate for Programming and the Budget will participate,
in close cooperation with the Planning Ministry, in the preparation of the
state investment budget insofar as the Tunis area is concerned. The Super-
vision Directorate will ensure conformity of projects being executed with
agreed plans, and will arrange cooperation with three public land corpora-
tions recently established to ensure the timely availability of land for
housing, industry and tourism.
The Urban Transport System
32.       The transport system serving metropolitan Tunis is in many ways a
function of the city's location and the configuration of the walled Medina
and adjacent modern city. The absence of adequate and properly enforced
regulations, standard lane-widths and systematic control of inter-sections
has resulted in mounting inner city congestion. Anarchic driving and park-
ing practices also prevail. Action to improve the urban transport system
is required now if major difficulties are to be avoided in the future.
33.       Ownership and use of private automobiles are low relatively to
many other cities of comparable size or wealth, but are increasing rapidly.
Private vehicle ownership has been estimated at one automobile for every
twenty-seven persons. About 75 percent of all passenger trips in the Tunis
area are still made by public bus or train. This compares favorably with
Buenos Aires (66%), Stockholm (57%), London (54%), and Kuala Lumpur (35%),
to cite a few examples from both developed and developing countries. .
34.       Public transport is provided in Tunis by the bus system and the
Tunis-La Goulette-La Marsa (TGM) northern suburban railway, both run by
Societe Nationale des Transports (SNT); by a suburban railway operated on
the main line to the South by societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer Tunisiens
(SNCFT); and by a taxi fleet of over 1,100 privately owned vehicles. Within
the metropolitan area SNT accounts for over 90 percent of public transport
trips made by bus and train, and nearly 70 percent of all passenger trips
by ali modes.



- 9 -
35.       SNT's urban bus fleet consists of 355 vehicles, of which over 100
are more than 12 years old. Due to the age of the fleet, inadequate manage-
ment and insufficient maintenance, the fleet utilization rate of 58 percent
is well below the standard (usually 85 percent or better) of efficient pub-
lic transport enterprises. The TGM railway line was constructed in the early
years of the century, and has benefitted from little new rolling stock since
its inception. In the absence of a major modernization program, it is esti-
mated that service could not be continued more than five years.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
36.       The project was first discussed with the Tunisian authorities in
early 1972. It was prepared by consultants to SNT and the Bank. Field ap-
praisal took place in January 1973. Negotiations were held from May 23 to
June 5, 1973. The Tunisian delegation was led by Mr. Moncef Bel Hadj Amor,
Secretary-General of the Ministry of Finance.
37.       The project consists of:
(a) consultant services to the Tunis District, to aid it in
carrying out its planning, programming and supervision
functions and in training its personnel;
(b) purchase of up to 210 buses, including an initial stock
of spare parts, to renew SNT's urban bus fleet and help
meet its needs for new vehicles;
(c) purchase of 26 electric railway cars, signalling equipment
and other materials required to renew the TGM railway line
of SNT;
(d) construction of a new bus maintenance depot for SNT;
(e) improvement of key traffic intersections and purchase and
installation of related signalling equipment for the Munic-
ipality of Tunis;
(f) consultant services for technical assistance, to the Govern-
ment, SNT and the Municipality of Tunis.
38.       A loan, credit and project summary are at Annex III.    The appraisal
report on the project (Appraisal of the Tunis District Urban Planning and
Public Transport Project, July 25, 1973, Report No. 157a TUN) is being cir-
culated separately to the Executive Directors.
The Tunis District
39.       Under the project, the Tunis District will prepare an urban devel-
opment strategy, encompassing an examination of urban land use. The District
will also carry out a series of special policy and feasibility studies. The



- 10 -
policy studies will be addressed to public transport solutions for metropoli-
tan Tunis, fiscal and financial questions at the District level, and housing
policies for the Tunis area. During negotiations it was confirmed that the
Government will consult with the Bank on the recommendations in these studies,
and agree with the Bank on action to be taken in their light.    Follow-up fea-
sibility studies on housing and industrial sites and services, and renewal of
the port area will also be undertaken. The Distr-ict will assume a leading
and coordinating role in other project preparation studies, and ensure that
they are placed in a metropolitan framework. In these activities it will be
assisted by the team of consultants provided under the project.
40.       The District will be responsible for overall supervision of project
execution, coordinating the work of the! different entities involved. Working
under guidance from the District, the Tunis Municipality will carry out the
traffic improvement program, and a consultant to it will aid in introducing
schemes to facilitate traffic flows and examine measures to enforce and, as
necessary, modify existing traffic and parking regulations. His work will
lead to the adoption, in agreement with the Bank, of a short and medium term
action program. For the long term, automobile regulation, restraint and pric-
ing policies will be among the subjects to be taken up by the District in the
urban transport ppolicy study. Thus, in its financing of physical improve-
ments and a series of associated studies, the project will give practical
expression to the Governm-nt's policy of priority for public transport.
The record of action in this respect will be an important element in the
consideration of a possible second Bank Group project for the development
of metropolitan Tunis.
Co-financing with UNDP
41.       The Bank/IDA and UNDP will jointly finance technical assistance to
the District of Tunis.  Preparation of the UMND  Project Document on assistance
to the technical services of the District was undertaken by a UJNDP mission in
Tunisia at the same time as the Bank appraisal mission.   The Bank will serve
as Executing Agency for the UNDP project. UNDP and Bank/IDA funds would be
drawn down in proportion to the participation of the two agencies in the
total.
Societe Nationale des Transports (SNT)
42.       SNT, a public enterprise entirely owned by the State, will be the
principal beneficiary of the loan and credit. It was established by statute
in March 1963 by the nationalization and merger of several smaller enterprises
providing public transport services. There are no disputes outstanding con-
cerning compensation of former foreign owners. In addition to urban services,
SNT provides inter-urban bus transport services. Their future will be con-
sidered in the context of a national transport policy study financed under
the Bank's highway project.
43.       In 1972, a new General Manager took over the running of SNT.    He
has introduced important technical, operational and administrative changes
to increase efficiency. During project execution, technical assistance in



bus and TGM rail operations and maintenance, and to help in the use of modern
managerial control and cost accounting procedures will be provided to SNT.
Consultants will also assist SNT staff in the preparation of tender documents
and the evaluation of bids.
44.       Physical execution of the project is expected to begin, with work
on the renewal of the permanent way of the TOM railway, in late 1973. New
buses are expected to arrive in batches starting in early 1974; up to the
end of 1975 SNT requires 210 new buses to meet its needs for replacement of
old vehicles and to expand its fleet to meet rising demand. Physical execu-
tion of the TGM improvement program will terminate with the delivery of the
last of three batches of railway cars in May 1975. These cars, a total of
13 motor/trailer sets, will replace the nine existing three-car trains; they
will increase capacity and reduce running time and breakdowns. The bus main-
tenance depot will provide the additional space and equipment required to im-
plement a sound maintenance program. Project execution is expected to be
completed by the end of June 1976.
Sfax Study
45.       The consultants to the Government would carry out a study of the
urban development options of Sfax, Tunisia's second largest city. The studies
undertaken by the District and by the consultants on Sfax may lead to a second
urban project in Tunisia in two to three years.
Cost Estimates
46.       The project is estimated to cost about TD 12.5 million ($28.6 mil-
lion equivalent). The foreign exchange component is estimated at nearly TD
8.5 ($19.53 million equivalent) or 68 percent of total costs. The following
table summarizes the cost estimates, excluding customs duties, which the Gov-
ernment intends to waive:

Financing Plan
47.       The Government will lend $16.552 million out of the proceeds of
the Bank loan and IDA credit to SNT on the terms and conditions applicable
to the Bank loan to the Government:   twenty-two years to maturity, four years
of grace, and 7-1/4 percent interest per year on outstanding principal. The
twenty-two-year term is based on a weighted average of the economic life of
the equipment and building to be financed under the loan and credit. The
Bank loan and IDA credit will finance 92 percent of the foreign currency costs;
UNDP will finance about 4 percent. Local financial institutions will finance
the remaining portion, for materials to be imported for use in manufacturing
bus bodies. The Government will bear the exchange risk and, with local banks,
complete the local financing required. The financing plan is summarized in
the following table:

Financial Position of SNT
48.       The Government plays a major role in SNT's finances because Gov-
ernment approval is required for, among other matters, operating and capital
budgets, staff rules and regulations, tariffs and borrowing. The SNT Statute
requires that if the Government imposes reduced tariffs for certain user groups,
as it does, then it must compensate SNT for the lost revenue. This has not
been done in the past, and SNT's books show a profit over the past few years
only because service has been allowed to decline. The enterprise is weak fi-
nancially, and with the present tariff structure, its urban bus and rail op--
erations would show significant operating losses in the next decade, even
after taking into account the major improvements in management and main.e-
nance planned under the project.
49.       SNT has agreed, under the project, to revise its accounting system
and to have its accounts audited annually by independent auditors. In addi-
tion, starting with the present fiscal year, SNT will maintain separate ac-
counts for its urban and its inter-urban operations. During negotiations
the Government agreed that in the future it will comply with its obligation
under the SNT Statute to compensate SNT to the extent that it imposes reduced
tariffs for certain categories of passengers. SNTts inter-urban operations
have experienced serious loses in recent years, and the company has agreed,
no later than December 31, 1974, to modify its inter-urban tariffs so that
its operating revenue (including any compensation for reduced tariffs) will
cover its operating expenses and debt service requirements on this branch of
its operations.
50.       For SNT's urban services, both the TGM railway and its urban bus
operations, it was agreed during negotiations that tariffs will be increased
in mid 1975 so as to yield an overall increase of operating income of not
less than 15 percent. The Bank's projections indicate that a financing gap
may remain, calling for additional tariff increases or subsidy payments by
the Government. Long term tariff policy for SNT's urban operations will be
considered in the context of an urban transport policy study to be carried
out by the District. The Government and SNT will adjust tariffs in agree-
ment with the Bank in light of the economically and socially desirable level
recommended in the study. Any Government subsidies will be linked to a set
of financial and operational performance criteria to be elaborated by SNT
with the assistance of consultants and agreed by the Bank by the end of
April 1974. These criteria will cover the introduction of improved finan-
cial controls, operating and maintenance targets, including manpower, and
indices of labor productivity. An annual review of performance and finan-
cial requirements will be carried out by SNT with the District, the Govern-
ment and the Bank.
51.       This approach to urban transport differs from the Bank's usual
concept of the financial autonomy and viability of enterprises whose invest-
ment programs it supports. Subsidization of metropolitan public transport
systems may be justified, however, since the external benefits of improved



- 14 -
public transport and balanced urban growth cannot be fully captured finaxi-
cially through tariffs. Since low income groups would be the main bene-
ficiaries of such subsidization, this would also be in keeping with the
social desirability of income transfers to such groups. The studies to
be carried out under the project, and especially the attempt to relate
subsidization to performance, will contribute to the Bank's knowledge in
this new area.
Procurement
52.       During negotiations, the Government requested that the Bank Group
finance imported chassis and mechanical sub-assemblies for buses; the compo-
nents would be assembled by the Tunisian automobile and bus manufacturing
enterprise, Societe Tunisienne d'Industrle Automobile (STIA). STIA had al-
ready invited bids for the supply of chassis and mechanical sub-assemblies
on the basis of procedures for international competitive bidding which con-
form with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines; it is expected soon to submit
its evaluation report and recommendations to the Bank for review and approval
before commencing corntract negotiations. To ensure that the cost co the proj-
ect of the STIA-assembled buses is not unreasonable, it was agreed during
negotiations that buses would be procured through STIA only if STLA's firm
offer does not exceed by more than 15 percent an international reference price
(c.i.f. Tunis) for compar.`,le buses, to be established by SNT with the assist-
ance of a consultant and agreed by the Bank. If STIA's price exceeds this
limit, SNT will acquire complete buses through international competitive
bidding.
53.       Local procurement of buses should help to build up STIA's capacity
to manufacture bus bodies and thus provide the impulse for a new industrial
activity in an area where, because of low-priced labor, Tunisia has a com-
parative advantage. STIA has experience in assembling buses from imported
components, and it has recently latuched an expansion program, which would
become operational with the project buses, under which it will manufacture
bodies largely from locally produced materials and complete the buses with
imported chassis and mechanical sub-assemblies. STIA will receive technical
assistance from van Hool, a well-knowrn European body manufacturer, with which
it has recently signed a licensing agreement. Its expansion program will
create some 300 new jobs within the firm, in addition to an unspecified number
of positions in domestic supplying industries.   STIA's participation in the
project would be consistent with the recommendations of recent Bank economic
reports, which proposed that Tunisia concentrate on labor-intensive production
such as assembly operations. Arrangements satisfactory to the Bank to com-
plete the financing of SNT's bus purchases under the project would be a con-
dition of Bank approval of SNT's contract with STIA.
54.       With the exception of the traffic improvement program of the Munici-
pality of Tunis, all project-financed items, including particularly the TGM rail
equipment and the construction and equipment of the bus maintenance depot, would
be procured through international competitive bidding.. A preference of fifteen
percent or the applicable customs duties, whichever is lower, would be applied
to bids from loca' equipment maniufacturers; preferential tariffs will not be



- 15 -
taken into account in bid evaluation. Standardization of the Municipality's
traffic signalling equipment calls for new purchases to be made from existing
suppliers through normal commercial channels. The Municipality's construction
works under the project will be carried out in small units, and procurement
of construction services will be undertaken in accordance with Tunisian Gov-
ernment procurement regulations.
Disbursement
55.       Bank and IDA funds will be disbursed under the project ir 1973,
1974, 1975 and 1976 (see Annex III for a breakdown). The IDA credit will
be disbursed before the Bank loan. For the purchase of buses, if locally
procured, the loan and credit will be disbursed against 45 percent of total
expenditures, representing the foreign expenditure component of the chassis
and mechanical sub-assemblies to be imported by STIA for use in manufactur-
ing complete buses for SNT, or 100 percent of foreign expenditures, if f in-
ished buses are procured through international competitive bidding. Dis-
bursements for equipment will be made against the foreign exchange cost or
100 percent of the ex-factory price; for construction works and consultant
services (jointly with the UNDP in the case of the Tunis District), against
the foreign exchange component. Retroactive financing of up to $50,000 for
consultant services to assist SNT is proposed.
Economic Evaluation
56.       The major quantifiable benefits under the bus component are obtained
from improving maintenance facilities, replacing over-age vehicles, and expand-
ing the fleet. The expansion of the bus fleet, combined with the provision of
improved maintenance, assures greater reliability of service and lower over-
all operating costs. Thus, the highest rate of return, over 29 percent, is
obtained when all three sub-components of the bus program are undertaken si-
multaneously, as is proposed under the project. The principal quantifiable
benefits of the TCM renovation program derive from a reduction in operating
costs and the costs of alternative transport modes in the absence of the
project that can be foregone. The savings taken into account include costs
avoided by not investing in highways to the extent required to accommodate
the additional automobile traffic that would be generated if the TGM line
were discontinued. The economic return is 16-17 percent.
57.       The expected non-quantifiable benefits of the project are no less
important than the quantifiable ones. The project's strengthening of the
Tunis District should lead to more coherent planning, programming and super-
vision of public investments in the metropolitan area. The public budget
would be able for a longer period to avoid major investments in urban high-
ways. The external diseconomies of private automobile use would be reduced,
and the efficiency of resource allocation increased. The principal direct
beneficiaries of the project will be people most dependent on public trans-
port, the low and middle income earners.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Cr 94: Second Education Project; US$13 million credit of September 16, 1966;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
Construction, furnishing and equipping of the project schools have
been completed, and related funds (US$9.82 million) have been disbursed. Fol-
lowing approval of the Executive Directors (IDA/R71-57), savings in the amount
of USS2.08 million have been reallocated for the purchase of equipment for
eleven technical schools and for assistance in educational planning to be
provided through UNESCO. The equipment for the technical schools is expected
to be delivered by October 1974. Three of the educational planning experts
are in the field, but the appointment of the remaining five is about six
months behind schedule due to recruitment difficulties. It is expected that
the Closing Date will have to be extended to December 31, 1974.
Ln. 484: Cooperative Farms Project; US$6 million credit and US$12 million
Cr. 97 : loan, both of February 21, 1967; Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
A detailed account of the problems encountered in implermenting this
project was contained in a Memorandum to the Executive Directors on November 5,
1970 (R70-213). The Executive Directors approved amendments to the original
Loan and Credit Agreements on November 17, 1970. Overall progress in execu-
tion of the revised project is satisfactory. All investments provided for
under the list of goods have been completed and disbursements are expected
to be completed by December 1973. The financial situation of the coopera-
tives is improving, and an aggregate profit of about TD 1.6 million (US$3.5
million equivalent) was achieved in 1972. The Bureau of Control is prepar-
ing an assessment of project accomplishments.
Ln. 573: Port Development Project; US$8.5 million loan of November 29, 1968;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
Work has been satisfactorily completed on most of the project items
and is progressing satisfactorily on the remaining items. The total cost of
the project is now estimated at $13.2 million, as compared to the appraisal
estimate of $10.7 million, although the foreign exchange component remains
at $3.5 million. The increased cost is due mainly to unexpected price in-
creases and to unforeseen soil conditions, which delayed construction and
required a one-year extension of the Closing Date. The increase in costs
does not invalidate the justification for the project. A further extension
of the Closing Date, to December 31, 1974, is expected to be required to per-
mit completion of a ports master plan study.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. 581:  Water Supply I and II Projects; US$15 million loan of JaAuary 16,
Cr. 209:  1968 and US$10.6 million credit of June 30, 1970, respectively;
Closing Dates: December 31, 1973 and December 31, 1974, respec-
tively.
Construction under the first project has accelerated after a late
start and is now proceeding satisfactorily; however, there have been problems
in the manufacture of project pipe, and it may be necessary to extend the
Closing Date. The total cost of the project is expected to be below the
appraisal estimate, but the likelihood of an unspent loan balance has been
reduced by dollar devaluation. Construction under the second project has
started, and disbursements have begun.
Ln. 606: Railways Project; US$8.5 million loan and US$8.5 million credit,
Cr. 150: both of June 4, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
This project has faced difficulties. The problems, mainly finar.-
cial, are attributable to (a) non-payment of freight charges by the railway's
largest customer, the state-controlled Sfax-Gafsa Phosphate Company; (b) op-
erational deficits due to low rates and fares, and (c) higher than estimated
purchase prices of rolling stock. Progress is now being made in resolving
these difficulties and in executing the project. The Government has taken
over the Phosphate Company's debts to the railways and paid a first install-
ment of $5.3 million towards the arrears of nearly $14.5 million. It has
also undertaken to reimburse railway losses in 1972 and 1973, estimated to-
gether at about $2.5 million, in addition to its annual contribution of $2.4
million. On the understanding that tariffs will be increased by January 1,
1974, the Bank and IDA have agreed to a reallocation of the proceeds of the
loan and credit which has permitted placement of all outstanding orders.
Cost increases of approximately $6 million for items in the original list
of goods are being financed by utilizing part of a general line of credit
extended by Spain to Tunisia. Completion of the project is now expected
by mid-1975. A request to extend the Closing Date is awaited.
Ln. 724: Gas Pipeline Project; US$7.5 million loan of February 25, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
Execution of this project has been satisfactory; operation of the
facilities began approximately one month ahead of schedule. Disbursements
are slightly ahead of schedule, and are expected to be completed before the
Closing Date.
Cr. 238: Population Project; US$4.8 million credit of April 5, 1971;
Closing Date:  June 30, 1976.
After a slow start, resulting in an 18-month delay, there has been
some progress in this project over the past months, but several problems re-
main. A management consulting firm working on the organization of the Tunisian
family planning program has presented its recommendations. The National Insti-
tute of Family Planning has been reorganized, to provide greater flexibility,

into a National Office for Family Planning and Population. An able Director
General has been appointed, and a Supreme Council for Family Planning headed
by the Prime Minister has been created. Nearly all sites for facilities have
been acquired, and preliminary designs are complete. However, construction
costs for the four urban maternity hospitals are now estimated at more than
twice the estimate of the architectural consultants at the time of appraisal,
increasing total project cost from US$7.7 million to about US$13 million.
The increases may be attributed to underestimates at the time of appraisal,
changes in the functional concept of the maternity hospitals, and the deval-
uations of the dollar. A mission has recently reviewed the situation and
steps to deal with the problem are under consideration.
Ln. 747: Highways Project; US$24 million loan of June 9, 1971; Closing Date:
June 30, 1976.
After a good start in 1971, project execution fell behind schedule
for various reasons, such as delays in bidding due to incomplete right-of-way
acquisitions and delays in selecting consultants to prepare detailed engineer-
ing. These problems have now been solved, though disbursements remain behind
schedule.
Ln. 771: Agricultural Credit Project; US$4 million credit and US$5 million
Cr. 263: loan, both of Ji-ly 12, 1971; Closing Date: July 31, 1975.
Execution of this project has been generally satisfactory, and
disbursements are on schedule. However, some difficulties may arise in
future if the Government does not take action, as required under the Loan
Agreemient, to limit competition between Bank/IDA fuads and its subsidized
agricultural credit, FOSDA, and if the Societe Tunisienne d'Industrie
Laitiere, STIL, does not improve its execution program. STIL is facing land
tenure problems and is showing weakness in the coordination of field activi-
ties. The Government, the agricultural credit bank and STIL are aware of
these difficulties, and action to solve them is under consideration.
Cr. 270: Fisheries Project; US$2 million credit of September 24, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
After unsuccessful efforts to design a completely new and still
economical vessel for the traditional fishermen, it has been decided to con-
centrate project efforts on improving construction techniques, materials, and
design of the existing traditional inshore fishing boat. Bids have been in-
vited for marine diesel engines. As a result of cost increases, project boats
will cost about 58 percent more than originally estimated; this will mean a
reduction in the numbei of boats to be provided by the project from 335 to
180-200. However, demand for boats at the nigher prices remains strong be-
cause fish prices have increased substantially since appraisal. It is now
expected that the first project boats will be constructed during the last
quarter of 1973.
Ln. 858: Tourism Infrastructure Project; US$14 million loan and US$10 mil-
Cr. 329: lion credit, both of September 2S, 1973; Closing Date: December 31,
1977.

Due primarily to delays in .idoption of the legislation establishing
the public land corporation to acquire land in the project zones, the loan and
credit became effective only at the end of June, 1973. Contracts have been
signed with consultants, and project activities are underway.
Ln. 648: Third, Fourth and Fifth Development Finance Company Projects,
Ln. 798: US$10 million loan of December 24, 1969, US$10 million loan of
Ln. 881: February 9, 1972, US$14 million loan of February 20, 1973,
respectively; Closing Dates: December 31, 1973, March 31, 1976,
and March 31, 1978, respectively.
Disbursements under Loans 648 and 798 are on schedule; Loan 881 be-
came effe:tive in May, 1973.   The provisional end year 1972 accounts indicate
that 1972 operations and profits were close to projections. The only signif-
icant problem is the substantial amount of arrears from hotel borrowers; these
are being closely watched, adequate security measures having been agreed with
the Bank. Future business prospects are good.
