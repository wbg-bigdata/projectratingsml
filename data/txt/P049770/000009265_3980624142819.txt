Country: India                                                         Second Renewable Energy Project
A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objectives and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
a) Augment power supply through environmentally sustainable small hydro investments;
b) Mobilize private sector investments in renewable energy power projects; and,
c) Promote energy efficiency and demand-side management (DSM) investments.
The Global GEF objectives are to enhance and sustain improved end-use energy efficiencies with consequent
reduction in carbon emissions. The key project concept is to catalyze an energy efficiency services industry in
India by addressing market development barriers and helping develop entrepreneurial initiatives including the
formation of Energy Service Companies (ESCOs).
B: Strategic Context
1 a. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: 17241-IN dated December 19, 1997: Date of latest CAS discussion: January 15, 1998
* The project directly supports the CAS objectives of reducing infrastructure bottlenecks and promoting
private sector development in the energy sector. Specifically, the project supports establishment of policies and
incentives for private investment in small scale power generation and helps mobilize private investments by
providing term financing through a financial intermediary.
* The project also supports the CAS objective of ensuring environmental sustainability in the energy sector by
exploring renewable energy and energy efficiency strategies. The initiative is in accordance with the India
Compact which calls for the Bank to assist the Government to implement priorities identified in its National
Environmental Action Plan (NEAP 1993), including development of the Alternative Energy Plan.
b. GEF Operational Strategy/Program Objective addressed by the project:
The proposed project is fully consistent with GEF Operational Program No. 5 on removing market barriers to
large scale application and implementation of energy efficiency services, products and technologies. Preliminary
estimates emerging from analysis of sixteen pilot energy efficiency investments (three ESCO-based, one utility
DSM, and the balance 12 industrial energy efficiency projects) indicate a total carbon avoidance of 0.76 million
tons at an incremental cost of US$6.6 per ton of carbon avoided. Based on studies prepared for a number of
states, the size of the ESCO market in India over the next 10 years is estimated at US$425 million. Although the
project directly supports less than 5 percent of this potential, if it successfully catalyzes India's ESCO market
involving a potential carbon savings of 6.3 million tons, the incremental cost of carbon avoidance resulting from
this proposed GEF intervention becomes as low as US$0.79 per ton of carbon.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
* India's power industry is characterized by inadequate and inefficient power supply with peak capacity and
energy supply shortages exceeding 20 percent and 10 percent, respectively. The bulk of capacity additions in
power supply is expected to come from coal-fired stations supplemented by hydroelectric power development
and medium-sized diesel or naphtha-based plants. However, fossil-based power has environmental repercussions
relating to emissions of suspended particulate matter (SPM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrous oxide (NOx), carbon
dioxide (CO2) and other gases. Large hydro power plants could lead to loss of forests, wildlife habitat and

Country: India                                                             Second Renewable Energy Project
biodiversity, and most importantly, the displacement of people. Cognizant of the need for environmentally
sustainable energy investments, the Government is accelerating the development of the country's renewable
energy resources so as to increase their contribution to power supply.
* Carbon dioxide from commercial energy consumption in India has grown at 5.9 percent per year since 1950,
making India the 6th highest national contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Over this period, total
emissions increased 10.4 tinnes, and per capita emissions increased almost 4 times. GHG emissions in India
continue to result largely from coal combustion with coal contributing 87 percent of the emissions in 1950 and 71
percent in 1991; at the same time, the emissions from oil-based activities increased from 1 I percent to 22
percent. I  In an EIS/AFOS Reference scenario2, carbon dioxide emissions are expected to increase roughly six-
fold from 359 MMT in 1985 to 2,273 MMT in 2025. Per capita emissions, however, are relatively low with India
trailing behind fourteen  other countries having the higlhest total emissions. Per capita emissions in 1991 were
-4% of the U.S. value.
* On the demand-side, inefficient pricing and a variety of market and non-market barriers to energy efficiency
have contributed to the inefficient end-use of electricity and thermal energy. This inefficiency exacerbates the
energy shortage situation. Energy pricing reforms emerging from restructuring of the power sector at the state
level are expected to heighten consumer awareness of the need for energy conservation. However, many
consumers in the industrial and commercial sectors who already pay high prices (above the cost of supply)
continue to under-invest in energy efficiency. Thus, while the technical and economic potential for improving
energy efficiency and thereby reducing carbon emissions in India is sizable, a host of barriers exist to capturing
this potential. The barriers include:
Financial constraints: (a) The discount rate gap in India distorts the market against investments in energy
conservation measures. The market generally favors expansion of power supply and industrial production
capacities, and subjects energy conservation investments to implicitly higher discount rates of 25 percent to 50
percent as compared to traditionally acceptable returns of 14 percent to 20 percent. This large discrepancy in
discount rates used has led to an emphasis on first-cost minimization and/or short payback period. (b) Cost of
energy-efficient equipment in India is high, and there is limited competitive pressure to reduce costs, although
with liberalization, this constraint is slowly receding. (c) Power supply is unreliable, and electricity prices are
set below generation costs , particularly in the agricultural sector.
Technical constraints include: (a) long in-service life of equipment and utilization of used (second-hand)
equipment; (b) limited availability of efficient equipment and components; (c) the manufacture of inefficient
products in the small-scale sector; and (d) end-users' aversion to taking risks associated with new
technologies.
Institutional and Policy constraints: (a) DSM/energy efficiency planning and evaluation skills are not
adequately developed in several key institutions, viz industries, utilities, commercial businesses and financial
institutions. (b) Utilities which would have to rule on the prudence of utility DSM investments have little in-
house experience in implementing DSM programs. (c) Financial institutions are constrained by the relatively
small size of investments involved and the lack of in-house expertise to assess reliability of energy bill savings
that would enable loan repayment. (d) There is a general absence of energy efficiency service providers,

implementation, particularly among the small and medium-sized firms. Risk sharing mechanisms by third
party investors are unknown.
Government Strategy
* To stem the shortfall in power supply and deterioration in electricity services, the Government issued policy
incentives to encourage entry of private sector investments. Selected states are restructuring their power sectors,
including establishing independent regulatory agencies, so as to create an attractive investment environment.
*  The Govemment considers the accelerated development of the country's renewable energy resources and of
energy efficiency programs as priority thrust areas under India's National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP).
The Ministry of Non-Conventional Energy Sources (MNES) administers one of the largest renewable energy
programs among developing countries. In 1987, the Government established the Indian Renewable Energy
Development Agency Limited (IREDA) under the administrative purview of the NINES. IREDA was given the
dual mandate of promoting renewable energy technologies and of providing financial support to investments in
the sector. Recognizing the opportunities afforded by private sector participation, MNES is giving greater
emphasis to power generation from renewable sources and in mainstreaming the technologies into the
commercial markets through IREDA's operations. At the state level, following the initiatives taken in the
southern region, other states have recently established policies and incentives, including wheeling and third
party sales arrangements, specifically intended to attract private sector development of small hydros as well as
of other small-scale renewable energy power facilities.
* The Government is pursuing a long-term strategy to disseminate information to end-users on opportunities
and technologies for energy efficiency improvements. The strategy has focused on energy audits and
information dissemination programs in the industrial sector operated by public sector institutions such as the
National Productivity Council, the Petroleum Conservation Research Association, the Industrial Development
Bank of India (IDBI) and the Energy Management Center (EMC).
* Tax incentives for energy efficiency investments are available, most notably a 100 percent depreciation
allowance for certain categories of energy-saving equipment. The Government has also supported limited
financing for energy efficiency investments in the industrial sector through IDBI. In the Ninth Plan, the
Government plans to allocate Rs. 1320 million (US$ 37 million) towards a national energy efficiency program
aimed at strengthening policy formulation, developing energy efficiency auditing services, and providing training
at the central and state levels.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by thie project:
a. The project supports government initiatives to reduce power supply shortages and reduce greenhouse gas
emissions through environmentally sustainable investments. It will mobilize private investments and
management resources in small scale power generation by tapping the country's vast hydro resources. It is
estimated that India has a potential of 10,000 MW of small hydro capacity; however, its development is
dependent on the ability of entrepreneurs to build the plants in a cost effective manner so as to yield sufficient
financial returns. To date, about 500 MW has been commissioned, with another 500MW underway, including the
125 MW capacity being financed by IDA through the on-going project with IREDA. There are 600 small hydro
schemes with an aggregate capacity of 1,580 MW which have been identified in nine states, with more sites
being identified elsewhere. Two-thirds of these sites are being offered by the states for development by the
private sector. The project will support the renewable energy development programs launched by the states
through dissemination of best practices on incentive regulation, grid inter-face arrangements, pricing and
delivery mechanisms and by making available requisite financing resources. It will assist private sector to better

Country: India                                                         Second Renewable Energy Project
understand the business risks associated with small hydro development including marketing and sales to third
parties. The project will also provide a basis for state governments to create a policy environment that would
encourage the setting up of viable utility businesses that would extend energy services to the rural areas and
remote communities.
b. The project will strengthen the national energy efficiency program by providing capital for energy efficiency
services, equipment and devices and promote business arrangements that would lead to reduced transaction costs
and risks. Specifically, the project will help overcome the barriers to investment in energy efficiency by: (i)
improving domestic capacity to promote and implement private sector initiatives in energy efficiency; (ii)
mitigating the costs and risks of developing and investing in smaller projects; (iii) disseminating information on
best practices in implementing energy efficiency services, technologies and cost recovery mechanisms; and, (iv)
providing medium-term loan and lease facilities.
4. The Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA): Development Strategy
*  To attain the Government's objective of accelerating the large-scale utilization of renewable energy sources,
financing of alternate energy technologies and systems has to be mobilized. Cognizant of the reluctance of
Indian financial institutions and commercial banks to assume the technological, business and financial risks
associated with renewable technologies, IREDA was established in 1987 to finance pioneering investments and
promote further technological improvements in the sector. IREDA's mandate is to catalyze the creation of
larger markets for renewable energy technologies, thus lowering investment risks and costs. IREDA mounts
technology promotion camlpaigns and offers entrepreneurial development training to foster investor interest in
the sector. At the same time, IREDA nurtures proven and near-commercial technologies by financing, initially
under concessional terms, business-oriented technology applications. And as the demand for the technology
grows, IREDA subsequently adjusts its financing terms to approach market interest rates. By so doing, IREDA
helps bring these technologies into the commercial mainstream with the end in view of encouraging other
financial institutions and investors to include renewable energy in their regular lending and investment portfolio,
respectively. IREDA's operations represent a unique experiment in commercialization of renewable energy
which other countries are now looking at replicating.
*   IREDA recently completed its first decade of service dedicated to the promotion, development, and
financing of renewable energy technologies in India. Altogether, it has financed some 837 projects in the areas
of wind energy, solar photovoltaic, small hydro, bio-gas, co-generation, briquetting, agro and solid waste power,
bio-methanation, improved stoves, and solar thermal. Starting from a small financial resource base (capital and
borrowings) of Rs 43 million and annual lending program of Rs 56 million, the Company has successfully
parlayed its operations into a multi-million rupee business. By 1997, IREDA's resource base reached Rs 6,197
million with an annual lending program of Rs 3,287 million. Annual pre-tax profit earnings rose from Rs 1.5
million to Rs 205 million over the decade. During the last five years, disbursement levels doubled annually,
profit increased at an average annual rate of 73 percent, assets by 67 percent and equity and reserves by 59
percent.
* Since 1993, Bank and GEF support through the Renewable Resources Development Project (Cr. 2449-IN,
GET28633-IN) helped propel IREDA to its leadership position in developing market opportunities for renewable
energy in the private sector. Due to the success of IREDA in promoting investor interest in various renewable
energy technologies, the Agency is now attracting financing from other multilateral and bilateral sources. As an
example, the wind generation program launched by IREDA with IDA and GEF support catalyzed over 900 MW
of new capacity in India, way above the project target of 85 MW. DANIDA, ADB and export creditors have
since provided additional financing for wind generation. In addition, ADB is supporting bagasse co-generation

Country: India                                                        Second Renewable Energy Project
and bio-methanation applications through IREDA, and KfW and OECF, among others, have expressed interest to
work with IREDA in financing various renewable energy investments.
*  IREDA's operations in the next five years is projected to expand considerably. To retain its competitive
edge, IREDA will have to work from a solid financial footing, keep up with latest technological developments
and continue to pursue sound and flexible business principles. Its financial asset base is expected to grow by
more than 30 percent annually, which will have to be matched by a parallel growth in funding. IREDA's equity
base will need to be strengthened to avoid the Company having to rely heavily on borrowings. Bank/IDA
assistance is estimated to account for about 20 percent of IREDA's borrowings. Recognizing the Government's
limited budgetary resources, and given the private sector thrust in creating a large scale market for renewables,
IREDA's Board has agreed, in principle, to explore various options to strengthening IREDA's capital base. The
comprehensive portfolio and financial performance audit, which IREDA will be commissioning under the
project, will measure the business risks faced by IREDA and serve as basis for exploring alternative measures for
improving IREDA's financial capacity.
C: Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2for a detailed description and Annex 3for a detailed cost breakdown):
The project is a follow-up Bank lending operation with IREDA to expand the small hydro program beyond the
southern region and to include innovative types of small hydro schemes. In addition, the proposed project will
support a new initiative within IREDA to promote and finance the delivery of energy efficiency services and
equipment, implementation of DSM schemes, and development of energy service companies (ESCOs).
Part A: The Small Hydro component will finance a total of about 200 MW of small hydro investments by the
private sector. About 30 MW of small hydro investments of up to 3 MW each by first time private investors in
the hydro business would be financed from the proceeds of the Credit, and the balance of small hydro
investments of up to 25 MW each would be financed from the Loan. The small hydro schemes would involve
the following types: (i) canal-based and dam toe schemes; (ii) run-of-river schemes; (iii) rehabilitation and/or
upgrading of old plants; (iv) use of tail ends of cooling water systems of thermal power plants; and, (v) stand
alone micro-hydro schemes of up to 100kW each. It is envisaged that over 80 percent of the schemes would fall
into categories (i) and (ii) ranging in sizes from IMW to as large as 25 MW. Irrigation canal-based and dam-toe
schemes are already being demonstrated to be relatively low-risk and cost-effective under the on-going IDA
operation with IREDA. Under the Second Renewable Energy Project, IREDA's loan window will also be
opened to other types of small hydro initiatives to test the business risks and opportunities surrounding these
transactions. Accordingly, financing will be made available for the development of run-of-river schemes in hilly
areas, rehabilitation of old plants, and installation of off-grid systems in remote rural areas. While some of these
initiatives involve more risks and are less economically attractive, the experience gained will serve as important
input in mapping out a strategy for decentralized energy options for rural communities. The project is thus
envisaged to result in assisting the states and private entrepreneurs in designing rural energy initiatives that
would feature partnerships between private investors and user communities as well as embody appropriate
service standards and cost recovery mechanisms.
Part B: The Energy Efficiency/DSM component will finance investments associated with: (i) design,
development and implementation of integrated energy management services operated by ESCOs and end-users
on a performance guarantee basis; (ii) purchase and installation of energy efficiency and/or load management
devices and systems; (iii) production of energy efficient equipment; and, (iv) end-user participation in SEB-and
other utility-sponsored DSM programs.
End-user specific energy efficiency equipment installations involve the purchase and installation of a
variety of energy efficiency and/or load management devices and systems. These represent schemes from among

Country: India                                                              Second Renewable Energy Project
a wide spectrum of end-users in the commercial, industrial and institutional sectors. The end-use technologies
cover efficient motors and motor-driven equipment, refrigeration, industrial cogeneration, boilers and steam
drives, efficient lighting and a variety of thermal devices and electrical control equipment designed to reduce
plant energy use. The size of the capital cost of the project is likely to vary from US$25,000 to US$250,000.
The ESCO-defined energy efficiency services will involve contractual partnerships with end-users. The
ESCOs will avail of IREDA financing and implement integrated energy efficiency solutions in end-users'
facilities under performance-based contracts. This will involve complete turnkey package of energy efficiency
services including energy auditing, feasibility study preparation, performance contracting, brokering financing,
specialized contract documents, and marketing. The ESCOs will be most effective in delivering energy
efficiency services to large industrial and commercial end-users with large and stable energy loads such as
continuous process paper, steel and chemical industries. Major electrical energy efficiency measures would
include cogeneration, load management controls, efficient motors, pumps and compressors and vapor absorption
refrigeration. On the thermal side, key investments would include efficient boilers and furnaces, advanced
combustion control systems, efficient steam systems, waste heat recovery and energy substitution. Investments
involved will typically range from US$250,000 to US$1.0 million. The indicative pipeline of such schemes
covers steel, chemicals and distilleries industry.
Part C: The Technical Assistance component will finance the following: (i) pre-investment activities aimed at
developing a sustainable pipeline of energy efficiency investments, preparation of standard bidding documents
for procuring ESCO services, operational and business development modules and information dissemination; (ii)
establishing in-house capacity within IREDA to appraise, supervise and promote energy efficiency services and
schemes; (i~ii) assisting participating states in promoting end-use efficiency including development of
appropriate policy incentives; and, (iv) training of public and private sector energy and industry officials and
staff on energy conservation and DSM.
The GEF-financed TA will support the incremental costs associated with preparatory and project
development and design activities. The key preparatory activity will involve mapping a strategy for investment
planning and business development that will identify, characterize and prioritize energy efficiency/DSM projects
and programs in terms of sectors, investments, customer response and interest, national economic and
environmental goals. Supporting activities include publicity and promotional campaigns that will disseminate
information on project guidelines and financing, development of ESCO proposals, and formulation of
appropriate evaluation criteria. A national survey is planned to collate and synthesize information related to
energy efficiency business development and investment including the identification of potential partners to foster
the implementation of the TA program.
Major project design and development activities will include: a) provision of technical assistance
(consultant) services on project proposal development, appraisal, procurement, quality assurance and
monitoring/evaluation of projects; b) development of standard bidding documents for procuring ESCO and end-
user defined energy efficiency services, equipment and installed system financing; c) preparation of operational
manuals detailing the procedural guidelines and terms and conditions of IREDA's line of credit for energy
efficiency business investrlents; d) preparation of business development modules to enable promoters and
developers evaluate and prepare business proposals (typically these will focus on risk assessment and analysis of
energy efficiency/DSM projects, ESCO financing models, market assessment of energy efficient technologies,
and monitoring and verification protocols for energy savings); and, e) dissemination of information on energy
efficiency solutions to enterprise managers, developers/investors, energy consumers and others. A key focus
will be on entrepreneurial development of prospective private sector energy efficiency service providers.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
a. The project will finance and promote small hydro sector development by the private sector in more states. It
will foster establishment of policy incentives for off-site captive power development as well as for sale by private
power producers to third parties and to the grid. The project will allow the participating states to track the best
practices for operational and delivery arrangements for grid-interconnected as well as isolated small hydro
development, which can then serve as basis for designing distributed generation and rural energy options
involving the private sector.
b. The project will address institutional and market barriers to implementation of cost-effective energy
efficiency measures among industrial and commercial sectors:
Policy Issues:
*    Skills and training needs will be addressed through fostering investments in training, information gathering
and dissemination;
* Lack of energy efficiency data base will be addressed through creation of comprehensive database on carbon
emission sources and quantum as related to end-use energy consumption;

*  The slow adoption of energy conservation technologies will be addressed through expansion of efforts to
promote the production of high efficiency technologies in India;
*  Poor institutional capacity and coordination will be addressed through implementation of institutional
changes to increase the priority accorded to national conservation efforts and to improve the coordination of
these efforts.
Private sector participation:
*  Weak financing institutional capability to develop and appraise energy efficiency projects. The GEF-
financed TA component will strengthen financing institutions' capacity to develop, appraise and finance ESCO
and end-user defined energy efficiency investments;
*  Lack of knowledge on energy efficiency business transactions and allocation of riskslbenefits. The TA
component will support development of skills and advance knowledge on the risks and benefits of energy
efficiency business transactions;
* Absence ofperformance contracting as a means to market and deliver efficiency services. The project will
formulate and test the validity and application of different energy efficiency project financing and
implementation models that deliver perfonnance based services;
* Poor availability ofprivate sector energy efficiency services in the country. The project will expand private
sector role in financing and delivering energy efficiency services and catalyze utility-led DSM programs.
3. Benefits and target population:
a. The project will augment power supply to meet the growing demand for electric power by user industries. It
will mobilize private sector capital and management expertise into the power sector, help diversify energy
sources and reduce, albeit in a moderate way, heavy reliance of the energy sector on fossil fuel.
b. The project will result in conservation of energy by industries and other end-users which, in tum, will directly
result in reduced GHG emissions.
c. The project will stimulate the development of an energy services market in the private sector and enhance an
understanding of risks and benefits of energy business transactions. It will pave the way for the emergence of a
new breed of entrepreneurs engaged in delivery and sales of electricity from small-scale decentralized power
facilities and of energy efficiency services.
d. Project beneficiaries are the industries, commercial establishments, communities and other electricity
consumers served by the small hydro power stations and availing of energy cost savings and productivity gains
as a result of energy efficiency and DSM investments.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements.
Implementation period: Five and one-half years (FYI 998/99 - 2003/04)
Project management: IREDA will be responsible for the overall management of the project. The Agency is
organized to appraise, supervise and monitor all the energy sub-projects eannarked for funding. The small hydro
unit at IREDA has established a good performance track record. A separate team to be headed by a General
Manager will oversee the energy efficiency portfolio which will be manned by existing IREDA staff experienced
in energy efficiency and management. In addition, IREDA will retain consultants and technical experts to assist
in technical and economic evaluation of the sub-projects as well as perform quality control and field supervision
work. The project incorporates activities designed to strengthen IREDA's capacity to undertake its project
management role. As administrator of the technical assistance (TA) program, IREDA will engage the necessary

consultant services and participate in relevant training programs to strengthen its in-house capacity to appraise,
supervise and promote its energy efficiency lending portfolio. IREDA will also organize and/or finance from
proceeds of the TA program funds, business meetings, policy dialogue and training events for end-users, energy
service providers, consultant firms, government agencies, financial intermediaries and other prospective players
in the energy efficiency industry.
Executing Entities and Implementation Arrangements: As a financial intermediary, IREDA will on-lend the
proceeds from the Bank loan and IDA credit to private developers and, on an exception basis, to state-owned
corporations meeting IREDA's loan eligibility criteria (refer to Annex 10). IREDA will ensure that sub-projects
and their promoters comply with the sub-loan eligibility criteria provided in its Operational'Policy Statement
(OPS) as agreed upon between IREDA and the Bank. IREDA's clients, i.e., private sector developers, ESCOs,
energy end-users and equipment vendors, will be responsible for the preparation, in-house or by their consultants,
of the feasibility studies and energy audits, detailed engineering, securing the necessary licensing and power
transfer/pricing arrangements, provision of necessary equity capital, and for applying for a loan from IREDA.
The developers will bear ultimate responsibility for incorporating least-cost solutions in the plant design and for
ensuring the integrity and safety of the schemes. Bidding, construction, installation, management, operation and
liability associated with each scheme would rest with the lead developer. IREDA will retain consultants to advise
its staff as well as its clients on quality assurance issues and project implementation management. IREDA will
work proactively with project developers and industry in advancing energy efficiency financing and ESCO
development in India.
On-lending terms: The IDA Credit will be extended to the Government of India and on-lent to IREDA under a
subsidiary loan agreement under the same terms and conditions of the Credit but with IREDA assuming the
foreign exchange risk. The IBRD Loan will be extended to IREDA, as Borrower, to be guaranteed by the
Government. Proceeds from the Credit and Loan will be on-lent by IREDA to private sector developers in rupees
at terms and conditions based on IREDA's OPS. IREDA's onlending rates for its various loan windows vary and
are subject to change from time to time based on, inter alia, IREDA's prevailing cost of funds, financial market
conditions, commercial maturity of the technology, project gestation, and pay-back period of the investments
being financed. Accordingly, some of IREDA's loan windows offer concessional financing, while those
involving more mature technologies are available at more commercial terms. The specific on-lending terms and
conditions applicable to each loan window are spelt out in IREDA's Financing Guidelines, a summary of which is
given in Annex 10. These include on-lending terms for loan windows supported by proceeds from the Bank Loan
and IDA Credit which IREDA sets according to its assessment of what the market can bear, pursuant to its
agreement with the Bank that said rates would approach market interest levels as the technology reaches
commercial maturity. Notwithstanding the differential pricing among IREDA's loan windows, IREDA is
required, under its OPS, to earn a positive return, in real terms, on its paid-up capital and reserves.
Currently, IREDA's on-lending terms for small hydros involve an annual interest rate of 16.5 percent
with a repayment period of 10 years, including a grace period of 3 years. The loan window for energy efficiency
will be launched with this project. The initial structure of onlending terms for this loan window is under design
and will be firmed up by December 1998 based on the structure of required financing emerging from the pipeline
of energy efficiency schemes. Currently, the loan interest rate of IREDA for energy efficiency systems based on
renewable energy is 16 percent, with a repayment period of 5 years and grace period of I year.
Policy guidance and support: Policy support for attracting private investments into small hydro development will
be provided by the respective state governments largely through the SEBs and energy development agencies.
These may include provision of fiscal and financial incentives, issuance of construction permits, and allowing
power purchase and delivery arrangements under commercially enforceable contracts. The Ministry of Non-
Conventional Energy Sources (MNES) will also provide policy and administrative support, including policy

interface with the states, to help sustain the momentum of the small hydro program. For the energy efficiency
component, a Steering Committee under the chairmanship of the Secretary, MNES, has been set-up to coordinate,
monitor and provide policy and program support. Members of the Committee include the Energy Management
Centre (EMC), Power Finance Corporation (PFC), Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Limited
(ICICI), National Productivity Council (NPC), and Department of Economic Affairs (DEA). The composition of
the committee will be varied depending on perceived needs; special efforts will be made to consult with industry
associations. Coordination aimong bilateral donors would be promoted in implementing similar or complementary
programs, e.g., USAID programs (Energy Management Consultation and Training; Energy Conservation
Applications) and the Indo-German Energy Efficiency Project for industry (G-EEP) being implemented by GTZ.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: IREDA operates an accounting system in conformity
with the Companies Act. IREDA's statutory auditor is a private firm appointed by the Government of India on
the advice of the Comptroller and Auditor General, who may also elect to carry out his own audit. In 1995, the
Agency was declared a Public Financial Institution and classified as a Loan Company, and thus subject to the
Non Banking Financial Companies Circular. IREDA's credit policy is sound as evidenced by the quality of its
loan portfolio. In support of the planned broad-basing of its capital base, and with the view of determining
IREDA's emerging capital adequacy requirements, IREDA has agreed to engage the services of external auditors
during the project's implementation to perform a comprehensive financial and portfolio audit based on
international accounting standards and international auditing guidelines. The upgrading of IREDA's financial
management and accounting system, including computerization of financial data base and procedures, has been
on-going with technical assistance support under the IDA-financed Renewable Resources Development Project
and GEF-financed India: Alternative Energy Project. Since 1993, the Financial Services group has been
strengthened, experienced accounting and finance staff recruited and the range of financial management and
planning activities widened. The unit's functions now range from accounting and budgeting matters to asset,
liability and risk management. The Financial Services group ably managed IREDA's multi-fold increase in
disbursement and business activities during the past years. IREDA has been in compliance with the key financial
covenants under Credit 2449-IN. In addition, lREDA ensures that its clients have accounting and internal control
systems which will support financial information required to assess sub-project implementation performance
under the sub-loan agreements. IREDA will furnish the Bank with copies of its annual financial reports and
current and five-year business plan together with five-year financial statements and cash flow projections. In
addition, IREDA will furnish the Bank with quarterly financial reports on the status of project implementation
which will provide a comparison of project expenditures with budgeted amounts, and establish linkage with
performance indicators. The quarterly reporting formats were discussed and agreed on during negotiations.
The Government will maintain records and accounts for project expenditures financed from proceeds of
the Credit, including those made on the basis of statements of expenditure. These accounts will be annually
audited in accordance with appropriate auditing principles by independent auditors acceptable to the Association.
The Government will also furnish the Association, not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year,
copies of the audited reports including a separate opinion by the auditors as to whether the statement of
expenditure, together with the procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to
support the related withdrawals. The project accounts will be prepared on a quarterly basis showing actual
expenditures compared to the budgeted amounts including an analysis for the variances.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: IREDA would monitor and evaluate sub-project performance through
regular field visits and progress reports from its clients. IREDA's respective project teams would handle sub-
project monitoring and supervision. IREDA will furnish the Bank progress reports on the status of the physical
works, consulting services, sub-project costs, contract processing and performance, disbursement, and
administrative arrangements for the project within 45 days of the end of each quarter. In addition, the progress
reports shall contain separate sections reporting on the following: (a) IREDA compliance with the OPS; (b)

implementation of energy efficiency/DSM projects will be monitored and reported. An evaluation system for
assessing the sustainability and effectiveness of GEF's intervention in catalyzing the ESCO business in India will
be developed and implemented. The Bank will field regular supervision missions to IREDA to review the
Agency's corporate and financial performance and evaluate the quality of its loan portfolio. The missions will
involve field visits to sub-project sites to elicit sub-borrower feedback, verify status of sub-project progress, and
identify and resolve issues affecting project performance. A third party supervision team will be commissioned
by the Bank to undertake an independent review of the project, and its recommendations will feed into the mid-
term project review. The Procurement, Disbursement and Audit (PDAT) Team of the Bank's New Delhi Office
will be actively involved in the supervision of the project in aspects relating to PDAT's functional services.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered:
*   One option is not to extend a second line of credit to IREDA and to let the commercial banking institutions in
India support the financing requirements of small hydro developers. However, since the program has so far been
largely limited to a few southern states, there is a need to support similar programs in other states and assist them
in creating an attractive investmnent environment. The project will also support innovative small hydro schemes in
remote and hilly areas. The market risks to be faced by new entrants to the small hydro business will likely
constrain the commercial banking sector from providing requisite financing. Further, the commercial banks are
not poised to undertake the requisite policy and technology promotions aspects of the program, whereas IREDA
has developed the in-house capacity to do so.
* Unlike the first operation wherein Bank group support consisted fully of IDA and GEF financing, the
IDA/GEF blend for the proposed project is being limited to 40 percent of Bank group assistance, with the IBRD
loan accounting for the major part of Bank support. This is due to the progress made towards commercializing
the small hydro technology under the first operation. In terms of total project cost, IDA/GEF will finance about
18 percent of the cost, compared to 50 percent in the first operation. The Credit will assist IREDA in offering
attractive terms for its energy efficiency loan window, as well as for new entrants to the hydro business investing
in schemes of up to 3 MWs including in hilly and isolated areas.
*  Bank support for energy efficiency is currently being extended through the state power sector restructuring
programs. Nevertheless, the Bank intends to pursue all feasible options in this area. Since power utilities are not
set up to finance investments on the customer side of the meter, they will require services of financial
intermediaries which can assess and assume the credit risks associated with end-user lending. A parallel support
through IREDA will thus complement energy efficiency efforts in these states, as well as encourage private sector
initiatives in other states to pursue both thermal and electrical efficiency opportunities.
*  Providing the energy efficiency loan to IDBI, the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
(ICICI) or state-owned financial entities was not considered because these banks focus their activities to relatively
large-scale diverse industrial modernization and development which may marginalize the energy efficiency
window. State development institutions were not considered due to their generally poor performance track
records. In contrast, IREDA is capable of serving a market niche among small and medium-scale projects in
various sectors in which its business has made inroads and is thriving, and the Agency is able to provide the
special promotional support needed for the project.
*   IREDA's role in advancing carbon emission mitigation by mobilizing private capacity is a critical basis for
its selection as implementing agency for GEF's technical assistance for the energy efficiency component. Energy
conservation or savings of conventional energy through substitution by renewable energy resources has been a
key result of IREDA's programs. In addition, there is close synergism between IREDA's renewable energy
activities and those required to advance the energy efficiency program. It is envisaged that the catalytic effect

such as that resulting from the IDA/GEF-financed windfarm program managed by IREDA will be replicated in
the energy efficiency programn.
Finally, while the project is private sector oriented, no private entity was found suitably prepared to offer
both technology promotions services as well as financial services for small and medium sized entrepreneurs such
as that currently rendered by IREDA.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in thle project design:
*   Under the first project, the cost of civil works for small hydros was underestimated during project appraisal
and loan financing was focused on equipment supply. This resulted in slow project completion, and delayed loan
disbursement as the borrowers had to first mobilize co-financing for the civil works which preceded equipment
orders and deliveries. The proposed project recognizes the significance of civil works expense for which Bank
financing will be made available. This will facilitate timely project completion.
*  A sufficient sub-project pipeline must be in place and early procurement action commenced to ensure timely
loan disbursements. IREDA has received applications for small hydro schemes involving an aggregate capacity
of over 60 MW, representing about 30 percent of the target hydro capacity. Project developers have been advised
on the tendering process acceptable to the Bank and advanced procurement actions have been taken by several
developers. Likewise, loan applications from the private sector for energy efficiency schemes involving the
entire proposed value of the energy efficiency component have been received by IREDA and are now under
evaluation.
* Whenever applicable, agreement by SEBs to provide the necessary transmission and sub-transmission line
facilities to connect the small hydro plants will have to be reconfirmed by IREDA with the State authorities given
the deteriorating financial positions of many SEBs. As in the on-going operation, cost of interconnection
facilities are eligible for funding.

*  In the late eighties, the Bank developed an Industrial Energy Efficiency Project in India which was later
abandoned. Among the lessons learned from this experience are those related to the linkage between energy
efficiency market barriers and the need for basic structural reforms in the power sector: e.g., pricing as well as
non-pricing barriers due to lack of appropriate tariff regulatory framework and inadequate institutional capacity
to design and implement utility led DSM programs. The current approach is to work in parallel, but separately,
on incentive-setting sector reforms and on project-specific design and operational issues. To this end, the Bank is
supporting one on-going and four planned DSM components as part of power sector restructuring projects in
various states. The project will benefit from the experience gained in the design and development of these DSM
projects.
* Lessons learned from the on-going Bank-financed DSM project in the State of Orissa are that: (a)
alternatives to utility driven DSM programs need to be explored to fully address market development barriers,
(b) the role of financial institutions is critical to appraise and administer EE/DSM loans; and (c) in the absence of
such financial institution support, utilities would be reluctant to finance energy efficiency projects on their own.
The current project plans to develop capacity in an Indian financial institution (IREDA) to appraise and finance
efficiency investments.
* Lessons learned from two other ongoing DSM programs outside India, namely in Mexico and Jamaica, are
that (a) pricing and regulatory reforms are necessary, but not sufficient, to maximize and capture energy
efficiency potential; and (b) key market barriers must be addressed in a sustainable wav to expand EE
investments. The proposed project plans to develop sustainable businesses such as ESCOs.
* Two current energy efficiency projects (under development) in Brazil and China will catalyze a market-
based energy efficiency industry, primarily ESCOs. The proposed project, however plans, to foster other market
delivery mechanisms in addition to ESCOs. Progress of the China and Brazil projects will be monitored for their
applicability to the Indian situation.
* Based on the deliberations of the IBRDlUSAID/IREDA-sponsored workshop on Energy Efficiency held in
February 1997 in which progress of various programs was reviewed, it was recognized that favorable prospects
exist for investments by industries in energy efficient products, devices and systems. However, the workshop
concluded that development of energy efficiency services aimed at providing integrated cost-effective solutions
face greater challenges due to the nascent nature of the Indian ESCO industry and the lack of experience in
performance contract arrangements. Consequently, a tepid market response may be generated during the initial
stages of the component until the commercial returns of such ESCO-based transactions are amply demonstrated
through pioneering schemes.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
Small Hydro Component
* A shelf of 20 projects already exists of which 10 have been approved by IREDA.
* Promoters have been advised of procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank, and tender documents have
already been prepared and floated for 7 schemes. Some contracts have already been awarded with construction
started in a few schemes. Since December 1997, sub-project expenditures of about US$ 9 million have been
incurred which are eligible for retroactive financing.
a Consultants for appraisal and supervision of sub-projects, and for procurement review, are positioned to assist
IREDA staff in further evaluation.
* Consultants for quality assurance and environmental assessment upgrading are being engaged.
* Terms of Reference and selection of consultants to complete pre-feasibility study for innovative types of small
hydro have been made.
Energy efficiency/DSM component:
* IREDA organized and hosted, with support from World Bank and USAID, a workshop on Energy Efficiency
Project Development and Financing in February 1997. The workshop served as a pre-project marketing activity

with participation of over 75 representatives from government, energy audit firms, vendors, financial institutions,
end-users and leasing companies.
a A pipeline of sub-projects has been prepared ranging from ESCO-defined energy efficiency services to discrete
investments in industrial energy efficiency devices and installed systems. Loan applications have been received
by IREDA involving US$30 million worth of investments which are currently under review.
* The position for general manager/deputy general manager to head the energy efficiency unit has been
advertised. Shortlisting from among 75 applications received is now on-going.
* Consultants have been engaged to assist IREDA in appraising the loan proposals for energy efficiency
investments and in developing an appraisal manual for staff use and guidance of borrowers.
5. Value added of Bank s,upport in this project:
* Bank support will help extend the small hydro program beyond the Southern region to other states in India
and thus sustain the momentum of on-going policy development and technology promotions efforts to bring small
hydro investments into the commercial mainstream.
*  Bank financing will help mitigate the risks associated with energy efficiency investments.
*  The Bank's continuing dialogue with reforming States, in which private investments, competition in
generation and transmission access are fostered, supports the project objectives. Moreover, the reform initiatives
include preparation of DSM-related schemes which can serve as a take-off point for development of a robust
lending pipeline for IREDA's energy efficiency loan window. Conversely, IREDA's energy efficiency programs
are also likely to advance the DSM objectives of the states' power sector reform.
* Best practices'emerging from the energy efficiency portfolio in other countries will be shared with project
participants in order to improve project performance effectiveness.
* The GEF grant is critical if the project is to achieve measurable success in addressing several pervasive non-
price and market barriers to energy efficiency in India. GEF support will enable India to mobilize, with
international support, alternative approaches to developing and financing conservation projects.
* The GEF-financed energy efficiency TA would contribute to strengthening in-country capacity to develop and
appraise market-driven projects; advance knowledge on the risks and benefits of business transactions, and
expand private sector role in financing and delivery of performance-based services.
* Finally, as demonstrated in the wind and small hydro sectors, Bank support for these technologies has raised
the awareness of the domestic banking institutions on the opportunities afforded by renewables resulting in their
providing stand-alone financing for wind projects, and co-financing for IREDA-approved small hydro schemes.
It is envisaged that a similar response would be elicited from the banking sector for energy efficiency investments
and that the project leads to mainstreaming by the banks of both energy efficiency and small hydro investments in
their loan portfolios.
E: Summary Project Aiialysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 12)
1. Economic (supported by Annexes 4 and 5):
[x] Cost-Benefit Analysis
Rates of Return (real): Small hydro: EIRR = 20% to 51%; Energy Efficiency: EIRR = from 26% to over 100%.
Each investment scheme is subject to economic appraisal by IREDA. Project viability is evaluated based on
market demand, project costs, value-engineering design, and least cost analysis. Only schemes which generate a
minimum of 12 percent economic internal rate of return in real terms are considered.
a. Small hydro: Given the chronic shortfall in grid power supply and decentralized location of the schemes,
economic benefits from small hydro are expressed in terms of the avoided cost of energy supply from self-
generation through diesel plants. This is estimated to reach Rs 3.38 per kWh in 1997 prices. Economic costs of
the schemes are derived by adjusting the capital and operational expenses for taxes and duties, and applying a
standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9 to the local costs. Annual operation and maintenance costs are taken at 2

Country: India                                                             Second Renewable Energy Project
percent of capital costs. A 20-year period of evaluation is used. Economic rates of return for the small hydro
sub-projects in the pipeline range from 20 percent to 51 percent.
b. Energy Efficiency: In estimating the economic costs of several indicative energy efficiency schemes, costs
and benefits were adjusted for taxes and a standard conversion factor of 0.9 was applied to local costs. Resulting
economic rates of return range from 26 percent to 155 percent. It is expected that IREDA will be able to estimate
with greater precision the value of energy savings involved in each scheme based on more detailed information
that will be required of applicants on specific project equipment costs, fuel and energy supplies and their
respective border prices.
2. Financial (see Annexes 4 & 6):
Rates of Return (nominal): Small Hydro: FIRR = 22% to 40%;  Energy Efficiency FIRR = 26%  to over 100%
a. Project Level. A sub-project qualifies for financing only if it yields a minimum financial IRR of 12 percent,
IREDA's hurdle rate. In addition, only those schemes which generate sufficient savings or revenues to service
the debt obligations with IREDA and other sub-project creditors are accepted. The corporate financial
performance and credit standing of the borrower is also evaluated and appropriate lending limits applied based on
assessed credit risk and corresponding security packages established.
Small hydros: The FIRRs of approved small hydro schemes currently in the pipeline range from 22 percent to 40
percent. The financial returns on the investor's equity taking into account debt and corporate tax structure are
also estimated for small hydro schemes based on conditions stipulated in the operating agreements with the States
and at lending rates currently offered by IREDA. It is assumed that developers will contribute at least 25 percent
in the form of equity. Financial returns on equity (post tax) range from 14 percent to 46 percent.
Energy efficiency schemes in the indicative pipeline yield FIRRs ranging from 26 percent to over 100 percent.
Financial returns to equity were also estimated yielding returns ranging from 34 percent to over 300 percent.
Despite such attractive returns, financial institutions have been slow to respond. Two of the important reasons
are: generally small size of the individual investments encountered in practice; and, lack of in-house expertise to
assess reliability of energy bill savings that would enable loan repayment.
b. Fiscal impact: The project's fiscal impact is expected to be neutral in the medium term. Benefits derived
from increased sales and reduced energy costs point to quick pay-backs to participating industries and utilities in
terms of improved productivity and profitability. The foregone tax revenues resulting from incentives provided
by participating states in terms of accelerated depreciation charges and tax relief to investors are compensated by
improvement in operating margins which in turn will generate tax revenues. Positive fiscal impact will be
generated when the demonstration effects of the project are taken into account.
c. IREDA 's Corporate Financial Performance (Refer to Annex 6)
* Since its creation in 1987, IREDA's business dramatically expanded, and the past decade saw IREDA's
financial operations consistently outperform earlier expectations. For example, results of IREDA's operations in
FY1997, exceeded appraisal projections prepared by the Bank in 1992, by posting 100 percent more in net
profits, 45 percent higher in disbursement levels, and about 10 percent more in asset base. IREDA's success
needs to be seen within the context of the Agency's two main objectives. On the one hand, it extends financial
assistance to entrepreneurs in renewable energy on which it should earn sufficient spreads on its funds. On the
other hand, IREDA is mandated to promote new and innovative technologies. Accordingly, IREDA not only
underwrites the costs of technology promotions and awareness campaigns, it also has to ensure that its lending
rates are sufficiently attractive to offset perceived technology risks. While discharging these functions, IREDA

balancing between IREDA's promotional and financial service activities. To date, IREDA has performed

* IREDA has been in compliance with the provisions of its Operational Policy Statement (OPS) earlier agreed
with the Bank. The original OPS calls for IREDA to eam a positive return, in real terms, on its paid-in capital
and reserves, maintain a debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) not lower than 1.5, and a maximum debt to equity
(including grants) ratio of 4:1. In view of the growing demand for its services, IREDA would have to expand its
business operations for which IREDA plans to mobilize funds from other external funding sources (e.g., ADB,
KfW, OECF) and promote co-financing with local financing institutions. To increase the leverage capacity of
IREDA and permit requisite business expansion, the OPS is being modified to provide for a DSCR of 1.3 and
D/E ratio of 5:1. Moreover, with IREDA now able to directly access foreign exchange loans, the OPS is being
modified to allow the Company to assume and manage the forex and interest risks associated with these loans.
For this purpose, a forex management unit is being set up for which advisers are being engaged to design forex
risk management programs and to train staff.
* In spite of the relative:ly high technological and commercial risks associated with IREDA's business,
IREDA has so far been able to maintain a sound loan portfolio characterized as follows: Normal accounts, 98.8
percent; sub-standard, 0.4 percent; doubtful, 0.3 percent; and loss, 0.4 percent. Overdue loans represent 1.2
percent of IREDA's overall loan portfolio considerably below the levels of non-performing assets reported by
some leading domestic commercial banks which range from 10 percent to 39 percent. Nevertheless, the level of
overdue in IREDA's portfolio is on the rise. Accordingly, under the project, a comprehensive portfolio audit and
related diagnostic studies will be undertaken with the view of determining loss provisioning and capital
adequacy requirements appropriate to the risks associated with IREDA's business.
* In view of IREDA's growing operations and increasing involvement in higher-value loans, further
improvements in credit management and portfolio review capacity will be called for. The technical assistance
program (TAP) associated with the on-going IDA operation already supports several initiatives for upgrading
IREDA's financial management systems. Consultants for credit, asset and liability, and for risk management are
currently being recruited.
3. Technical:
*  IREDA reviews the technical soundness of each investment scheme based on the detailed project reports
(DPR) prepared and submnitted by the private developers and their consultants. In the case of small hydro
schemes, the DPR includes, inter alia, the hydrological data, results of geological surveys, and plant engineering
designs. The promoters also are required to demonstrate use of appropriate designs based on value engineering
considerations. Technical configurations for irrigation canal and dam-toe based schemes, as well as for run-of-

river schemes, have been shown to be cost-effective and viable under the ongoing IDA-financed Renewable
Resources Development Project. Quality assurance review during construction and commissioning will be
conducted by consultants engaged by IREDA. Operational manuals on appraisal and monitoring of small hydro
schemes were developed under the on-going IDA operation. Guidelines to borrowers on preparation of small
hydro investments including acceptable procurement procedures are available.
*  For energy efficiency schemes, IREDA will assess the performance effectiveness of the energy management
techniques applied and equipment to be installed. Appraisal and monitoring manuals, guidelines for borrowers,
as well as model bid documents for procurement of ESCO services will be developed under the project's
technical assistance package. Technical capability for delivering energy efficiency services is reasonably
developed in India. There are a large number of energy audit companies located mainly in the Western and
Southern regions. These firms conduct detailed energy audits, techno-economic analysis of energy efficiency
options and provide engineering system designs for recommended solutions as well as offer procurement and
implementation services. However, there is only a handful (about four) of ESCOs operating in India and most
have yet to offer full range of integrated energy services under performance contract arrangements. ESCO
formation is thus an area to be promoted under the project. Generally, the technical risks associated with energy
efficiency projects are minimal to moderate since in most cases the projects involve known and tested
engineering/technological applications. However, in the case of ESCOs and integrated systems solutions that
have been largely untried in the Indian situation, the risk of failure is being addressed by carefully designed
implementation plans, including monitoring, verification and dissemination activities proposed under the current
project. Moreover, in the case of ESCO projects, the technical risk of project performance will be assumed by the
ESCO. These risks will be assessed at the time of project development and will be reflected in the performance
contracts between the parties.
4. Institutional:
a.     A key result of the project is to enhance awareness and interest among the investor community and
energy consumers on the business opportunities and socio-economic benefits afforded by development of energy
efficiency services and of small hydro and other renewable energy resources. As described earlier, there are
several market and institutional barriers to energy efficiency investments and ESCO formation which the project
will be addressing through the GEF-financed technical assistance program. On the part of power plant
developers, a key challenge lies in the forging of alliances among various stakeholders at the state and local level
so as to result in timely plant commissioning and sustainable delivery of power. On the other hand, local
engineering consultancy base for small hydro development is relatively mature and widespread in India, and local
and joint venture turbine manufacturing facilities have expanded since the launching of IREDA's IDA-assisted
small hydro loan window, with equipment supply generally meeting performance norms.
b.     An innovative aspect of the project involves exploration of alternative arrangements for bringing the
benefits of distributed generation to the rural areas particularly in the grid expansion zone, and possibly to
isolated areas. The experiences gained by the entrepreneurs in operating off-site small hydro facilities are
expected to result in lowering of risks associated with future transactions which opens an opportunity to stimulate
investor interest in setting up mini-grids to serve the rural areas in cases where the economics of distributed
generation prove favorable.

5. Social:
The bulk of small hydro schemes will be built within the right of way of existing canals or dams and will
therefore not involve land aLcquisition nor displacement or resettlement of people. In cases where land is acquired,
this will be done on a private "buyer-seller" basis. Sub-borrowers will be required to conduct a Social Impact
Assessment (SIA) and the results presented as part of the detailed project report to be submitted to IREDA for
appraisal. A set of SIA guidelines (refer to Annex 9) will be issued by IREDA to its clients together with the SIA
Framework and the Bank's OD: 4.30. IREDA will secure undertakings from its borrowers on compliance with
the relevant provisions of the SIA framework and through the legal and contractual arrangements for each sub-
loan. The project is expected to yield positive social impact. Many of the enterprises that will avail of the output
of the small hydro projects and savings from energy efficiency schemes employ significant numbers of low-
income people. Energy efficiency will increase enterprise productivity including improvements in the reliability
of power supplies. These positive outcomes will help ensure the enterprises' financial viability, encourage
expansion of operations and increase employment opportunities.
6. Environmental assessment: Environmental Category: B
a. The project will have limited adverse impact on the environment and will contribute to improved air quality
by displacing fossil-based energy systems, particularly, diesel engines and kerosene lamps. Replacement of
diesel for power generation will reduce emissions of SOx, NOx, CO2 and particulate. The small hydro schemes
will largely be on existing irrigation works and cause minimal changes to the existing environments. IREDA
requires that all projects in its portfolio have central government and state environmental clearances. IREDA's
technical staff will review environmental issues and advise borrowers on the preparation of environmental impact
assessments. A set of environmental review guidelines (Annex 8), acceptable to the Bank, is being issued by
IREDA to its clients.
b. Justification/Rationale for category rating: The project directly supports environmentally friendly
technologies and initiatives. Small hydro development reduces reliance on polluting fossil-based fuels and avoids
the environmental issues associated with large hydros. Most schemes will be situated in existing canals where
basic infrastructure facilities are already in place. Only schemes meeting Government environmental standards
and the Bank's OD 4.01 will be financed. Furthermore, improvements in electrical and thermal energy
efficiencies in industrial and other operations will advance local, regional and global environmental objectives.
At the plant level, the project will reduce air pollution associated with thermal energy conversions, e.g.,
combustion of fossil fuels. At the regional level, energy savings would reduce the possibility of acid rain and
particulate emissions since the Indian power system would reduce the use of coal at the margin. Benefits at the
sub-continental or global level relate to the positive impact of reduced carbon emissions on climate change.
7.i Participatory approach.:
a. Most of the canal and dam-based hydro projects will normally be built on land owned by government entities
in which case consultation with landowners will rarely be necessary in regard to the siting of the projects.
Utilization of water for power generation will require information sharing with other users of the water.
Construction activities will likely involve workers coming from outside the development area requiring
consultation with local communities during preparation stages. In the case of sub-projects featuring isolated
small hydro schemes for power distribution to remote communities, project proponents would have to foster
active involvement of beneficiary electricity consumers from the project design phase through the operational
stage to ensure adequate end-user support.
b. Other key stakeholders: State electricity boards, irrigation departments, equipment suppliers and other
electricity service providers would be involved in various stages of sub-project preparation and implementation as

these entities will be providing administrative, logistical and operational support to ensure that the sub-projects
become operational. A series of business meetings on small hydros have been organized by IREDA in several
states over the recent years, during which program and policy information have been shared with various
stakeholders.
c. Local groups and NGOs consulted: Extensive discussions have been conducted at several Energy Efficiency
workshops and seminars with potential project participants that include industry, energy efficiency companies,
research institutions, government agencies and NGOs. These discussions have resulted in the constitution of a
multi-agency Steering Committee, represented by the above local groups, to oversee and guide the project.
F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
The small hydro projects will be designed to last for more than twenty years, and as revenue earning assets, there
will be a strong incentive for the owners to maintain them in good condition. Sustainability is supported by the
low costs involved in running the plants and establishment of long-term arrangements for their operation by the
private sector. IREDA would promote and foster the role of the private sector to deliver energy efficiency
services through profitable, cost-shared business arrangements. The cost savings resulting in short pay-back
periods would render energy efficiency investments replicable. Pilot projects that test a wide range of energy
efficiency investment models would also enhance understanding of commercial, technical, institutional and other
risks that surround energy efficiency project development, financing and implementation. Thus, the project will
assist in arriving at empirical-based measures of the business and other risks associated with the transactions as
well as validate achievable technical energy savings. These would help reduce the perception of risks associated
with energy efficiency project financing in India. The project is expected to generate interest among commercial
financial institutions in India to include small hydro and energy efficiency financing in their loan portfolios.
IREDA's performance to date shows that it is able to help bring renewable energy technologies into the
commercial mainstream through its business and training meetings with developers, co-financiers, and suppliers,
and through networking with technical consultant firms, and encouraging state entities to foster private
development of the large potential of small hydro sites and energy efficiency schemes identified in state and
utility surveys.

Annex 2
Second Renewable Energy Project
Project Description
Introduction. The project will provide a line of credit to IREDA. proceeds of which will finance development of
small hydro power stations and energy efficiency investments by the private sector. Financing of technical
assistance activities to strengthen IREDA's capacity to promote these loan windows and develop local
entrepreneurship in the small hydro and energy efficiency fields will also be provided.
Project Component A - US$263 million: Small Hydro Investments. Financing of up to 200 MW of small
hydro investments by the private sector, with focus on the following types: (i) canal-based and dam toe schemes;
(ii) run-of-river schemes; (iii) rehabilitation and/or upgrading of old plants; (iv) use of tail ends of cooling water
systems of thermal power plants; and (v) stand alone micro-hydro schemes. It is envisaged that over 80% of the
schemes would fall into categories (i) and (ii). This will allow IREDA to expand its on-going small hydro
program from the southern states to the northern and central states of India. Proceeds from the IDA Credit of up
to about US$30 million equivalent would be made available for development of schemes of up to 3MW each by
first time private sector investors in the hydro business. The balance of schemes will be financed from proceeds
of the IBRD Loan.
Market Potential. In 199 1, a study under the UNDPlWorld Bank Energy Sector Management Assistance Program
(ESMAP) investigated the prospects for small hydropower projects in five states--Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka,
Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and. Punjab. The study concluded that there are numerous sites, many of them at canal drops,
where it is technically and financially feasible to develop small scale hydro projects. Successful implementation of
these schemes is being demonstrated under the on-going small hydro program through IREDA. A significant
number of potential sites with an aggregate capacity of more than 1570 MW has since been identified for
development by private sector entrepreneurs. Currently, 137 sites with an aggregate capacity of 570 MW have
been allotted to private dlevelopers, and 241 sites involving 469 MW are in the process of being allotted.
Following the initiatives taken by the three southern states of Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh, other states
have recently promulgated policies and guidelines encouraging private participation in small hydros. The large
volume of applications elicited by recent advertisements of potential sites is indicative of the keen interest among
private sector investors to develop small hydro sites to meet the captive power needs of their industries as well as
to avail of the business opportunity to sell electricity to the state grids or third parties at attractive rates.

Irrigation Canal-based and Dam-toe schemes. Canal drop schemes involve low-head plants with large volumes
of water flow. They are built on a by-pass channel alongside the canal. Water is diverted into the by-pass upstream
of the canal drop and flows through the power house before it returns to the canal. The heads available for
development generally range from six to twelve meters, and the power plant capacities are in the range of I MW to
6 MW. Horizontal shaft Kaplan turbines are adopted in most cases. The dam-toe plant schemes are usually sited

on a canal below an existing dam, but some simply develop the head between the reservoir and the tailwater below
the dam. Turbine and generator technology are well established for low-head canal drop and dam-toe schemes and
civil works are relatively simple. These projects present no significant technical risks.
Run-of-river schemes. These plants involve development of a head by cutting off a loop in a river. They consist of
a diversion dam, a tunnel, a penstock and a powerhouse. They develop much higher heads than canal drops and use
much smaller volumes of water. Thus the higher cost of the civil works is offset by the small physical size of the
turbines (usually Francis type) and related equipment. While run-of-river schemes occasionally involve tunnels
which pose some geological risk, the tunnels are usually short.
Upgrading old plants. India has a long history of small hydro development and a number of old plants are still in
operation, albeit at de-rated capacity. These plants can be upgraded with new efficient equipment at reasonable
cost. For example, IREDA can finance private sector investments under Rehabilitate Operate and Maintain (ROM)
contracts.
Utilizing the cooling water discharge of thermal power plants. Cooling pond plants exploit the head at the outlet
of cooling ponds at thermal plants. A capacity of over 68,000 MW of thermal power plants are in operation in
India providing a sizable potential for developing such small hydros schemes. Several studies have been conducted
in sufficient detail to confnir their technical and financial feasibility. A replicable model for energy retrieval and
conservation is foreseeable.
Stand alone micro hydros. These are small plants (25kW to 100kW) that develop the head of small mountain
streams. They usually involve small Pelton wheels that are installed with a minimum of civil works. A pilot
project sponsored by MNES for supply and installation of micro hydro sets in remote villages has sparked an initial
success story as a decentralized energy option as well as a community development program. Micro hydros are
however less likely to be economical compared to small hydro although they meet social objectives. Economically
viable schemes can be considered for fimancing where proper distribution and recovery mechanisms are ensured
through the private sector and with the active participation of community groups or NGOs.
Project Component B - US$30 million: Energy Efficiency and Demand-side Management (DSM)
Investments associated with: (i) purchase and installation of energy efficiency and/or load management devices
and systems; (ii) production of energy efficient equipment; (iii) design, development and implementation of
integrated energy management services operated by ESCOs and end-users on a performance guarantee basis; and
(iv) end-user participation in SEB-and other utility-sponsored DSM programs. Based on the indicative project
pipeline, the energy efficiency portfolio will broadly fall under two program components: a) End-user energy
efficiency devices and installed systems; and, b) ESCO defined energy efficiency services. The indicative
investment pipeline consists of thirteen proposals involving end-user specific energy efficiency products and
installed systems, and three ESCO-based schemes.
End-user specific energy efficiency equipment installations involve the purchase and installation of a variety of
energy efficiency and/or load management devices and systems. These sub-projects are likely to represent the
major part of the project in terms of their numbers and application across a wide spectrum of end-users, e.g.
medium and large industry, commercial offices and hotels, government buildings/facilities, public and private
hospitals and schools, etc. The end-use technologies cover efficient motors and motor-driven equipment,
refrigeration, industrial cogeneration, boilers and steam drives, efficient lighting and a variety of thermal devices
and electrical control equipment designed to reduce plant energy use. The size of the capital cost of the project is
likely to vary from US$ 25,000 to US$250,000.
The ESCO- defined energy efficiency services will involve contractual partnership with end-users. The ESCOs will
avail of IREDA financing and implement integrated energy efficiency solutions in end-users' facilities under
performance-based contracts. This will involve complete turnkey package of energy efficiency services including
energy auditing, feasibility study preparation, perfornance contracting, brokering financing, specialized contract
documents, and marketing. The ESCOs will be most effective in delivering energy efficiency services to large
industrial and commercial end-users with large and stable energy loads such as continuous process paper, steel and
chemical industries. Major electrical energy efficiency measures would include cogeneration, load management

chemical industries. Major electrical energy efficiency measures would include cogeneration, load management
controls, efficient motors, pumps and compressors and vapor absorption refrigeration. On the thermal side key
investments would include efficient boilers and furnaces, advanced combustion control systems, efficient steam
systems, waste heat recovery and energy substitution. Investments involved will typically range from
US$250,000 to US$ 1.0 million. The indicative pipeline of such schemes cover steel, chemicals, distilleries
industry as well as a program on leasing of capacitors.
Performance cotracts will be employed in the financing of ESCO-driven energy efficiency projects. In
performance contracting, an end-user (such as an industry), seeking to improve its energy efficiency, contracts
with the ESCO for energy efficiency services and financing. Since energy efficiency projects generate
incremental cost savings as opposed to incremental revenues from the sale of outputs, the energy cost savings can
be turned into incremental cash flows to the lender or ESCO based on the commitment of the end-user to pay for
the savings. The essence of performance contracting is that some part of the contract is based on the ESCO's
performance in achieving energy savings. Thus performance contracting through an ESCO transfers the
technology and management risks away from the end-user to the ESCO. For energy users reluctant to invest in
energy efficiency, a performance contract can be a powerful incentive to implement a project. Performance
contracting also minimizes or eliminates the up-front cash outlay required by the end-user. Payments are made
over time as the energy savings are realized.
Vendor driven ESCOs will also be supported by the project. Such ESCOs will deliver turnkey energy
efficiency projects including engineering, procurement, installation, operation and maintenance, measurement and
verification of efficiency gains, performnance guarantees and project financing. The client base of vendor driven
ESCOs are likely to be Indian State Electricity Boards, private utilities and private industry. Technologies and
systems offered would include low tension and high tension capacitors and switched capacitor panels for reactive
power management and load monitoring systems; amorphous core distribution transformers; efficient lighting;
efficient motor systems and metering equipment. The ESCO structure will be based on off-balance sheet financing
using a sale-lease-back arrangement where the vendor sells the assets to a profitable leasing/financing company
and leases back the assets for on-leasing to the SEBs. The profitable financial internediary gets the full
depreciation benefit thereby enabling it to lower its lease rents to the vendor ESCO. The vendor ESCO's lease
payments are fully secured by back to back lease payments of the SEBs guaranteed by an acceptable bank letter of
credit or an escrow account built up by previously earmarked SEB revenues. The financial intermediary (leasing
company) retains the ovnership of the assets created. The difference between the two lease streams is the revenue
stream for the ESCO which provides the installation, operation and maintenance service to the SEB. Such a
financial structure results in low cost financing for essential investments with a payment stream that is:
-  a fraction of the cost savings realized by the SEBs;
*  can be put to tender to meet the procurement regulations of the SEBs;
*  and, the obligation of the SEB to pay can contractually be made subject to the installations remaining
operational and generating specified efficiency gains.
Risk Assessment. There are five types of risks inherent in performance contracting:
*  Project Development Risk: This is the risk that the project won't be implemented even though funds have been
spent on project development. Equity investors in the ESCO mostly bear project development risk
*  Performance Risk: The principal performance risks associated with performance-based projects relate to
engineering and system design and equipment performance. Engineering and system design risks address the
risk that the project is properly engineered to achieve energy savings and that the design is appropriate to the
end-user's applications and existing facilities. Equipment performance risk means that the new equipment can
perform according to its specifications. The ESCO's experience, warranties, the reputation of equipment
manufacturers, the performance history of previous projects, and engineering due diligence are the main
methods for evaluating these risks.
*  Hours of Operation and Use/Load Risk: If the energy-consuming equipment is not used as projected, there can
be no savings. In general, the end-users assume this risk.
*  Construction Risks: Lenders must be confident that the project will be constructed in time, within budget, and
according to specifications.
*  Credit Risks: The customer's ability to continue to be a going concern and to meet its obligations for both
energy services payments and loan or lease payments is a risk to both the ESCO and the lender.

* Projects involving ESCOs include the following services: equipment procurement, installation and maintenance, energy
management and monitoring and verification of energy savings.
Project Component C - US$7 million: Technical Assistance (TA) will: (i) finance pre-investment studies with a
view of developing a sustainable pipeline of energy efficiency investments and support project design activities
including preparation of business development modules and model bidding documents for procuring ESCO
services; (ii) strengthen IREDA's capacity to appraise, supervise and promote energy efficiency and small hydro
investments; (iii) assist participating states in developing appropriate policy incentives to promote private sector
development of end-use efficiency, and, (iv) training of energy service providers, end-users and government and
industry officials and staff on energy conservation and DSM. A detailed description of this component which will
be financed by the GEF is presented in Annex 5.
Implementation Arrangements
Overall Project Management. IREDA will have overall responsibility for project management and for
supervising and coordinating the implementation by its clients of the various project components. As a
financial intermediary, IREDA will on-lend the proceeds from the IDA Credit and Bank loan to private
developers and, on exception basis, to public corporations. All sub-projects will be appraised and
evaluated by IREDA according to its loan eligibility criteria (see Annex 10). The first two schemes on
energy efficiency as well as the first ESCO-based scheme will be subject to the Bank's prior review and no-
objection clearance. All other sub-projects involving total project costs equivalent to US$5 million or
above would be subject to Bank prior review and clearance. Bid documents and procurement arrangements
entered into by the sub-borrower would be reviewed by IREDA to ensure they follow Bank procurement
guidelines. Procurement arrangements in place under Cr. 2449-IN would remain in place.

On-lending terms and conditions. IREDA will on-lend proceeds of the Bank loan to its clients based on
termns and conditions spelt out in IREDA's Operational Policy Statement (OPS) as agreed with the Bank.
These terms and conditions include inter alia: minimum promoters contribution of 25%; adjustability of
lending rates based on IREDA's prevailing cost of funds; security provisions and a loan amount limit
equivalent to 20% of IREDA's paid-in capital plus reserves plus grants. Current lending rates for Rupee
loans for small hydro schemes range from 16.5 % to 17.0% with 10 years repayment including 3 years
grace. Terms for the energy efficiency loan window will be finmed up by December 1998. IREDA may,
however, choose to offer in the future, loans denominated in US dollars, in which case the on-lending
rates would be pegged to the LIBOR plus appropriate points to cover IREDA's margin.
Implementation arrangements between IREDA and implementing entities. The sub-borrowers will implement the
respective sub-projects and will handle the bidding and contract awards, supervise construction and own and
operate the facilities upon commnissioning. IREDA would monitor and evaluate project performance through
regular field visits and progress reports from the clients. The sub-loan agreements between IREDA and its client
would provide that the sub-borrower agrees to undertake the following in the course of sub-project
implementation: (i) maintain proper financial accounts and records based on Companies Act; (ii) allow inspection
by IREDA/Bank of matters related to the sub-loan; (iii) prepare and submit to IREDA regular reports on the
progress of sub-project implementation and utilization of the sub-loan; (iv) ensure that the sub-loan is used solely
for the goods, works, and services required to implement the sub-project; (v) procurement follows Bank guidelines
and contracts; (vi) appropriate insurance coverage is provided for goods financed from proceeds of the sub-loan;
and, (vi) that the environmental and social impact assessment guidelines are complied with.
Management of TA Components. The TA program will be managed by IREDA and will be integrated
with the management of the on-going multi-donor TA program. IREDA will continue to issue a separate
quarterly progress report on its TA activities for circulation to IREDA's various donors.
Coordination and responsibilities of implementing entities and other agencies. Project beneficiaries are the
electricity end-users who avail of the increased power supply generated by the small hydro power stations and
consumers who benefit from reduced outages and from productivity gains accruing from energy savings. In most
cases, the beneficiaries are themselves the investors in the sub-projects, and hence will exercise due diligence in
sub-project implementation to ensure the value of their respective investments are not only preserved but
enhanced. Developers would need to comply with state and government regulations including environmental
norms, water use and power supply standards, among others.
Policy support from the state governments would be required, especially for the small hydro component,
to ensure that the developers are able to secure the appropriate clearances to proceed with the project construction.
Moreover, arrangements for the wheeling and sales of power and grid interconnection have to be established with
the SEBs, under commercially enforceable contracts. Policy and administrative support from the Ministry of Non-
Conventional Energy Sources Power, including interface with the states, would help sustain the momentum of the
small hydro program. An inter-ministerial Steering Committee has been set up this purpose. The Committee is
composed of the Secretary, MNES, as chairman and representatives of ICICI, DEA, PFC, EMC, and NPC as
members.
Participation arrangements. Design and construction of small hydro plants would require extensive consultations
by the developer with the SEB, irrigation and water authorities, and state energy development boards. In addition,
information sharing with surrounding communities are encouraged to build goodwill and avoid misconception that
use of water for power production would reduce available irrigation waters for the farmers. Implementation of the
project is not expected to involve displacement of people since most schemes will be situated in areas where the
right-of-way have been secured. In the exception that right-of-way acquisition is involved, this would be on a
"private buyer- private seller" basis, and sub-borrowers would be required to keep the local population duly
informed of the status of sub-projects. On the DSM program, to extend the demonstration effect of successful
energy efficiency schemes, consultation with business federations and consumer groups would take place.
Foreign exchange risk management. With IREDA now bearing the foreign exchange risks associated with
external funding support, a foreign exchange risk management unit is being established within the Agency. At the

same time, consultants are being engaged under the on-going technical assistance program to serve as advisor(s) to
IREDA on this area. In the interim, IREDA has recently entered into an arrangement with the Bank of Baroda for
forex risk management including swap arrangements for withdrawals of loan from one of its external creditors, i.e.,
Asian Development Bank.
Role of the Bank during project implementation. The Bank will monitor the progress of project implementation
through the quarterly progress reports prepared by IREDA. The Bank will field regular supervision missions to
IREDA to review the Agency's financial performance and evaluate the quality of its loan portfolio. The missions
will occasionally involve field visits to sub-project sites to elicit sub-borrower feedback, verify status of sub-
project progress, and identify and resolve issues affecting project performance. As in the on-going IDA operation
with IREDA, third party supervision will be commissioned by the Bank to undertake an independent review of the
project, and its recommendations will feed into the mid-term project review. The Procurement, Disbursement and
Audit (PDAT) Team of the Bank's New Delhi Office will be actively involved in the supervision of the project in
aspects relating to PDAT's functional services.
Monitoring and Evaluation (refer to Annex Ifor a list of key performnance indicators) IREDA's respective
project teams would handle sub-project monitoring and supervision. Regular progress reports are submitted to
IREDA by the sub-borrowers. In addition, IREDA staff would conduct site visits as well as hold regular dialogues
with the investor community and state energy agencies on progress of implementation of their respective small
hydro projects and programs.
IREDA will furnish the Bank quarterly progress reports on the status of small hydro privatization program
in the various participating states, the physical works, consulting services, sub-project costs, contract processing
and performance, disbursement, and administrative arrangements for the project within 45 days of the end of each
quarter. The progress reports shall contain separate sections reporting on the following: (a) IREDA's compliance
with the OPS; (b) compliance by sub-borrowers with conditions of the sub-loans; (c) changes in policy incentives
for small hydro and DSM programs; (d) loan portfolio performance analysis; (e) status of multi-donor technical
assistance program; and, i(f) latest record of its own institutional development program. In addition, IREDA will
furnish the Bank copies of its annual financial reports and current and five-year business plan together with 5-year
financial projections including cash flows.
A mid-term review of the project will be conducted by the Bank in or before December 2000. Prior to
said review, but no later than October 31, 2000, IREDA will engage the services of consultants to conduct an
independent assessment of the project and furnish the Bank results of said review.

Cost Benefit Analysis Summary
(In Rupees, Base Year = 1997)
A. Small Hydro Component
Financial Analysis:
*                1.         Financial benefits consist of revenues to be earned by the firm  from  the sale to third parties or to
the grid of energy generated from  the small hydro plants.  Prices of energy are based on the specific
purchase price agreements. In the case of captive power schemes, the benefits are expressed in terns of
the tariff that the firm would have otherwise paid to utilities if they could draw from the grid. A 10%
annual rise in grid tariffs are assumed, which is relatively conservative based on past trends.
2.         The cost stream  consists of the capital cost of the power plant and the following expenses:
o    Operation and maintenance costs equivalent to 2%  of capital cost, with 5%  annual escalation;
o    Insurance expense at 0.5%  of capital costs
o    Auxiliary energy consumption at 0.5%  of generation;
o    Wheeling charges, water royalty fees, and electricity tax based on agreement with the state involved.
0    Duty on imports: zero
o    A  20-year period of evaluation was used.
The resultingfinancial internal rates of return (nominal) for the schemes currently in thte project
pipeline rangefrom 22% to 40%. Thefinancial internal rates of return (real)for the schemes currently
in the project pipeline rangefrom 13% to 33%.
3.         In addition, the financial returns to investor equity were calculated, taking into account the debt
structure, corporate tax structure, and other financing charges. Among the assumptions used are:
0   Minimum 25% of equity contribution;
0    Depreciation rate of equipment: 20 years
0    Income tax rate: 35 %
The post-tax returns to equity are estimated to rangefrom 14 % to 46 %Y.
Economic Analysis:
4.         The economic benefits of the small hydropower schemes consist of the electricity generated by
the plants valued at the avoided cost of energy supply. The shortage in grid supply has prompted industrial
and commercial electricity users to resort to diesel generators to meet their growing power needs.
Development of small hydros would be an altemative to captive diesel generation. The cost of
autogeneration from  diesel engines is estimated at Rs3 .38 per kWh, based on CIF price of fuel.
5.         Economic costs of the schemes were derived by adjusting for taxes and applying a standard
conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9 to local costs.
The resulting economic rates of return (real) for the sub-projects in the pipeline rangefrom 20% to
51%10.

B. Energy Efficiency and DSM Component
Financial Analysis
6.           Financial cashflows over a ten-year project period were developed for sub-projects in the
indicative pipeline consisting of 3 ESCO-defined energy efficiency services sub-projects, 12 end-user
specified installation of energy efficient devices and systems and 1 utility-based DSM scheme. Financial
benefits are derived from savings in fuel and energy payments resulting from the investments. Non-energy
savings in operating and maintenance expenses are also anticipated in a number of schemes.
7.           Cost streams include investment costs which largely occur within one or two years and
incremental operation and maintenance expenses.
Resulting Financial Internal Rates of Return (nominal) for these projects range from 26 % to 158%.
8.           Returns to investor's equity were also calculated based on the following assumptions:
0   Debt-equity ratio: 3:1;
0   Financing Terms and Conditions: Interest rate: 17%; Up-front fee: 1.0%
0   Repayment period: 10 years (including 2-year grace); quarterly loan installments
0   Depreciation Rate (Indian Cos. Act, SLM): 4.75% - 10.34%
0  Depreciation Rate (Income Tax, WDV): 25.0% -100%
0  Income Tax Rate: 35%
The post-tax returns to equity range from 34% to over 300%; payback period range from 8 months to 4
years.

Economic Analysis
9.           In estimating the economic costs of the indicative energy efficiency schemes, costs and benefits
were adjusted for taxes and a standard conversion factor of 0.9 was applied to local costs. Resulting
economic rates of return are expected to be higher than what the current estimates suggest. It is expected
that IREDA will be able to estimate with greater precision the value of energy savings involved in each
scheme based on more detailed information that will be required of applicants on specific fuel and energy
supplies affected and their respective border prices.
Resulting indicative economic rates of return rangefrom 26 % to 155%.

Annex 5
Calculation of Incremental Cost
India: Second Renewable Energy Project
INCREMENTAL COSTS AND GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS
BROAD DEVELOPMENTAL GOALS
1.    It has been estimated that primary energy consumption will need to more than quadruple over the next two-and-a half
decades in order for India to achieve an average annual GDP rate of 4.9%. Historically, in India, energy demand has increased
somewhat faster than economic growth. Between 1970 and 1987, the energy/GDP ratio increased by 40% - largely caused by
substitution of biomass fuels by modem fuels, increased use of oil for transportation and electricity for agriculture, and poor end-use
eniergy efficiencies achieved in industrial practice. The unit energy consumption of most production processes in India is much
higher than that of the industrialized and rapidly industrializing countries. For example, steel production requires almost twice as
much energy per unit of steel output as that in the U.S. or South Korea. Similar differences exist for aluminum, cement and paper as
well as household appliances and other end uses. The potential for introducing energy efficiency in the Indian economy is therefore
quite substantial.
2.    Energy efficiency and DSM have the important advantages of mitigating India's endemic problem of energy and capacity
shortages cost-effectively in comparison to increasing supplies. As environmental costs (including the threat from global climate
change) weigh heavily against coal-based generation, India will need to accelerate the pace and direction of its energy efficiency
efforts, advance fuel substitution (non-coal) and clean-coal initiatives and invest in the development of environmentally sound
energy efficient technologies and systems.
BARRIERS
3.     While the technical and economic potential for improving energy efficiency and thereby reducing carbon emissions in India
is sizable, a host of barriers exist to capturing this potential. GEF-financed activities under this project is designed to precisely
address some of the more critical barriers related to institutional development and private sector capacity building to promote the
delivery of energy efficiency services in India. Together with Bank-assisted power sector reforms in a few Indian states, the
implementation of energy efficiency is likely to achieve considerable momentum. Based on current observations and status of energy
efficiency in India, it is believed that the GEF project is in a unique position to address a number of barriers in the policy and private
sector arenas. Specifically, the GEF-assisted project will address the following key barriers:
Public policy barriers:
-  weak institutional capacity to develop/appraise energy efficiency projects
-  inadequate investment planning and integrated resource planning (IRP) skills
-  lack of energy efficiency standards; insufficient energy efficiency market data base
Private sector barriers:
-  inadequate experience on energy efficiency business transactions
-  absence of energy efficiency performance contracting mechanisms
-  paucity of energy efficiency service providers
MARKET PROSPECTS
4.    Preparatory DSM/energy efficiency studies under the Orissa, U.P., Rajasthan State Power Sector Restructuring Project(s)
and the Second Renewable Energy Project: Energy Efficiency Component, provide a preliminary estimate of the potential ESCO
market in India. The size of the market thus estimated must be viewed as approximate with a +/- 25% error. The Table below
provides an initial estimate of the ESCO project size and is predicated on the availability of a sizable number of ESCOs operating in
the country and the acceptance of performance contracting as a mechanism for delivering energy efficiency services to consumers.

5% of the potential. However, as a pilot demonstration exercise it would serve the important purpose of opening and testing the
market and validating the concept of performance contracting thus serving as the basis on which additional private ESCO efforts and

7.     The total estimated savings in electrical energy on account of the IREDA II energy efficiency projects is estimated at 188.2
GWh/year. This accounts for less than 1% of the total achievable economic potential 30,146 Gwh and about 2.5% of the industrial
potential of 7493 GWh. The project is based upon an arrangement wherein two-thirds of the financing (e.g., USS 20 million) will
leverage the balance one-third from energy consumers and service providers. The GEF grant is expected to catalyze the necessary
arrangements that leverage such private sector energy efficiency investments including formation of ESCOs in the private sector.
BASELINE SCENARIO
8.      With a little over two decades of energy conservation experience, the Indian energy conservation program remains largely a
captive to the past. Economic, institutional and technical barriers to implementation of cost-effective energy efficiency measures
persist despite the growing number of energy efficiency programs undertaken in the country. Despite growth in supply, India's power
systems are struggling to overcome chronic power shortages and poor power quality. Power shortages have resulted in voltage
reductions, involuntary load shedding and the widespread installation of standby captive capacity by industry, commercial and
residential establishments. Standby captive power generating plants are in most instances stationary diesel engines which are costly,
inefficient, polluting and a rapidly growing source of greenhouse gas emissions.
9.      Growing out of the need to reduce dependence on costly petroleum fuels imports in the early seventies, early conservation
efforts were directed at providing diagnostic fuel efficiency audits of consumers and information dissemination through training
programs and national educational campaigns. Success in the early years led to an evolution in the methodology and reach of the
program to cover major sectors (large and medium industry, road and rail transport) in India's principal cities and industrial locales.
In the mid eighties, targeted investment schemes offered by leading Indian development financial institutions catalyzed, with modest
success, the entry of a few private sector energy efficiency service providers. In the late eighties, a World Bank proposal to provide a
standard line of credit together with a broad-based technical assistance package to promote industrial energy efficiency was
withdrawn and justifiably so, following of lack of discernible progress on pricing, tariff and institutional reforms to address the
specific conservation market barriers. As India transits to a market oriented economy that strives to integrate with the rest of the
world, measures to dismantle its trade and investment barriers run counter to its industry's inability to compete with global leaders.
The GOI has recognized the key role that energy efficiency could play in terms of its importance to industrial competitiveness and
economic growth.
10.    Today, the petroleum fuel conservation activities continue to provide subsidized services to consumers with limited impact;
financial institutions have all but withdrawn from financing energy efficiency investments; and, project development and financing of
energy efficiency services, equipment and systems by the private sector is very nascent. Driven by the need to mitigate power
shortages, improve quality of delivered energy and reduce capital needs for capacity expansion, electric utilities are taking the first
tentative steps towards introducing demand side management programs. In summary, the pace and direction of conservation efforts in
India is fragmented and desultory. The government programs are unable to provide the specificity and implementational features
demanded by an increasingly sophisticated consumer. On the other hand, the private sector is unable to capitalize on the expanding
market for risk-shared, performance based efficiency services.
Baseline Components:
11.    The baseline TA will develop capacity in IREDA to promote, market and finance traditional energy efficiency projects and
programs. In the absence of an alternative to Bank/GEF funding, it is assumed that IREDA will follow the standard program design
and diagnostic audit approaches that characterized past efforts. The baseline components of the project would include, a) TA program
that would be largely focused on providing energy audit services and, b) an energy efficient equipment financing investment
component. This would be similar in several respects to past efforts of several Indian development financial institutions4 who had
mixed success in developing and sustaining energy efficiency portfolios. Without dismantling specific market development barriers
that impede energy efficiency solutions, India's energy conservation program would likely be marginalized and continue to decline in
size and effectiveness. It is equally unlikely, given the virtual absence of energy efficiency services market delivery mechanisms, for
private sector services and investments to step in.
4In the early eighties IDBI launched two industrial energy efficiency schemes: i) the energy audit services scheme, and ii) equipment
financing for energy efficiency program. Both of these were subsequently withdrawn.

GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS
12.    The project proposes to enhance and sustain improved end-use energy efficiencies with consequent reduction in carbon
dioxide emissions by increasing private sector role and investments in the provision of energy efficiency services and equipment. This
is sought to be achieved by fostering capacity in India to promote, catalyze and implement private sector initiatives in energy
efficiency services delivery. This enhanced capacity in entrepreneurial development, including formation of ESCOs, will represent a
new and critical dimension to energy efficiency project development, financing and implementation in the country.
13.    Preliminary targeted savings of a few pilot energy efficiency activities implemented by ESCOs and/or energy end-users
(includes three ESCO projects, one utility DSM, and balance 12 industrial energy efficiency projects over a ten year period) are
estimated at 0.76 million tonnes (mt) of carbon at a cost of US $6.6/ton of carbon to the GEF5.
GEF-FINANCED ALTERNATIVE
14.    The GEF grant for technical assistance (TA) is proposed to strengthen financing institutions' capacity to develop, appraise
and finance ESCO and end-user defined energy efficiency investments. The TA will help develop skills and advance knowledge in
the country on the risks and benefits of energy efficiency business transactions, formulate and test the validity and application of
different energy efficiency project financing and implementational models that deliver performance based services and results.
Furthermore, the GEF TA will expand private sector role in financing and delivery of energy efficiency services, and catalyze the
development and implementation of utility led DSM programs in the country. Other related benefits that would accrue include energy
efficiency awareness building, program promotion and business development.
15.    The TA will address the following three areas: i) preparatory activities, ii) project development and design, iii) institutional
development and capacity building. While i) and ii) are incremental costs to be covered by GEF, item iii) represents the baseline costs
of developing traditional EE projects, in a business as usual scenario. The baseline TA program will seek to strengthen IREDA's
capability in energy efficiency lending. This component will support, a) creation and strengthening of the energy efficiency lending
cell at IREDA; b) establishment of energy efficiency database of services, technologies and projects; c) specialized local and foreign
training on energy efficiency project development and financing for IREDA staff, ESCOs and energy audit consultants; d) program of
energy audits in enterprises, and, e) program of accreditation of ESCOs/consultants and empanelment of efficient equipment
manufacturers.
SYSTEM BOUNDARY
16.    The analysis consists of the comparison between (a) the baseline cost of implementing EE projects without undertaking the
key preparatory activities and without capacity building towards project design and development (see Section 20-21, above), and (b)
the cost of implementing these projects including the incremental features associated with the technical assistance program included in
the altemative. Participants are essentially the industrial end-user sector, private and public utilities, ESCOs, equipment vendors,
government bodies including financial institutions.
COST
17.    Total cost of the proposed project without the incremental features included in the Altemative is estimated at US$ 32 million.
The incremental costs of developing the capacity to design and implement energy efficiency delivery services is estimated at US $5.0.
The total cost thus, is estimated at US$ 37 million.
18.    The baseline technical assistance cost of US$ 2.0 million will enable program development and promotion along traditional
patterns, namely, advocacy-oriented budget, rather than market driven, subsidized energy audit services, etc. These have proved to
have obtained limited results and few successes in the past. The role of the private sector energy efficiency service provider has been
marginal under such a scenario.
19.    The incremental technical assistance cost of US$ 5.0 million will enable the design of integrated energy management
services by energy efficiency service providers/ESCOs and end-users on a performance guarantee basis. The ESCOs will avail of
IREDA financing and implement integrated energy efficiency solutions in end-users' facilities under performance-based contracts.
The capacity building effort planned through IREDA will assist delivery of complete turnkey package of energy efficiency services
including energy auditing, feasibility study preparation, performance contracting, brokering financing, specialized contract documents
and marketing.
