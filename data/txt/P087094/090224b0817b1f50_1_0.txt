                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since the last implementation mission significant progress has been by both entities on project implementation. A majority of the project activities have been completed or are
                         underway while the few remaining activities will be contracted shortly. The disbursement rate has been raised from 38% in March 2012 to 55% in October 2012. In total 80% of the
                         grant has been contracted. In addition, all of the specific actions agreed during the last mission in March 2012 have been fulfilled. The team believes that the project will be able to
                         fully achieving its Global Environmental Objective and Project Development Objective. Progress in key areas includes: Baseline ecological assessments for UNA and Blidinje are well
