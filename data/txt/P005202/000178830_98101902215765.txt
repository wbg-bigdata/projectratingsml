INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO THE INDUSTRIAL CREDIT BANK
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF IRAN
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Industrial Credit Bank (ICB) with the guarantee of Iran for the
equivalent of US$25 million to help finance industrial lending. The initial
amortization schedule provides for repayment over a period of fifteen years,
including two years grace, but is subject to change in order to conform sub-
stantially to the aggregate of the amortization schedules applicable to the
specific sub-loans financed out of the proceeds of the loan. The interest
rate would be 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY -/
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Pros-
pects of Iran" (R71-129) was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 1,
1971, and an updating Memorandum (R73-74) was distributed on March 26, 1973.
A Basic Economic Mission visited Iran in September/October 1973 and the re-
port of this mission is under preparation with a view to distribution to the
Executive Directors not later than June.    Country data sheets are attached
as Annex I.
3.        During the past decade Iran has been able to achieve an average
annual growth rate of about 11 percent in real GNP. The boom in oil rev-
enues, which increased sixfold from about $400 million in 1962 to about $2.5
billion in 1972, has been an essential factor underlying this performance.
Part of the receipts from oil have been absorbed by defense spending and
other current expenditure, but a major part has been utilized by the Gov-
ernment to finance investment in economic infrastructure and a rapidly grow-
ing, modern industrial sector. Domestic capital formation rose from 22 per-
cent of GNP in 1968 to over 25 percent in 1973. The oil receipts also en-
abled the Government to borrow abroad on a large scale and enabled develop-
ment to proceed, at least until the past two years, with relative price
stability, because the ready availability of foreign exchange allowed the
Government to use import policy as an anti-inflationary device. However,
largely because of rises in import prices, the consumer price index rose
six percent in 1972 and an estimated 11 percent in 1973.
1/   Paragraphs 2-11 are identical to those included in Part I of my Report
to the Executive Directors on the Second Ports loan, dated May 6, 1974



- 2 -
4.        The sustained tempo of economic activity has been accompanied by
substantial changes in economic structure. The share of agriculture, which
accounted for 33 percent of non-oil GDP 'in 1962, fell to 20 percent in 1972,
while the share of manufacturing increased from 15 percent to 20 percent over
the same period. Employment in agriculture, as a proportion of the total
active population, declined from 52 percent to 40 percent, while industrial
employment rose from 15 percent to 21 percent. In 1962, 35 percent of the
population lived in urban areas; in 1972 the figure was 42 percent.
5.        But rapid growth has also highlighted the problems of income dis-
tribution and regional development, because different socio-economic groups
and geographic areas have not received the benefits of development equally.
Consequently, there are large contrasts in thie consumption per head in dif-
ferent regions. Increases in real income have accrued to only about half
the population over the past ten to fifteen years. While large cities are
equipped with modern social and economic infrastructure, in most villages
progress has consisted mainly of the greater availability of a small range
of cheap manufactured products and the provision of part-time (often under-
staffed) social welfare facilities such as health clinics and primary school
classrooms. The majority of Iran's 60,000 villages still do not possess elec-
tricity, piped drinking water, graded roads or other communications. In the
medium-size towns the situation is better and there is little apparent dis-
satisfaction with the pace of progress, but there is a growing sense that
places such as Kerman, Kermanshah and 1Hamedan, have great potentialities
which can now be more fully exploited for the benefit of the local people.
In the larger urban centers, there is little or no open unemployment, and
underemployment has also been reduced in recent years. Nevertheless, in the
towns as a whole there are still a considerable number of poor households,
though not as many as in the rural areas wqhere average income levels are
only 20 percent as high.
6.        The Government has long aimed at a more balanced development, but
only recently has a serious commitment been made to redress some of the in-
equalities in income distribution. It is now officially recognized that
there is a need to develop wider domestic markets for the products of in-
digenous manufacturing in order to maintain industrial growth rates; the
Government also desires to disperse migration to a larger number of cities
so as to avoid excessive concentration which is already causing substantial
congestion costs in major centers such as Tehran. Some progress has been
made in establishing decentralized poles of development, and a number of
important administrative and organizational changes have recently been in-
troduced. At the center, the Government's administrative machinery is now
generally well-organized, but it has been recognized that there is still
a need to strengthen provincial and local authority in order to promote
development in less advancedt regions.
7.        RapTdly growing oil revenues have enabled the Government to pursue
a highly expansionarv economic policy and have also relieved the fiscal au-
thorities of any sense of urgency in establishing a more elastic system of
domestic resource mobilization. While increases in revenues from sources
other than oil, particularly direct taxes, have kept pace with ONP, it has



- 3 -
been expenditure policy which has mainly determined the level of public
savings; in particular, defense and security spending, which constituted
over half of the increase in current expenditures during the period 1967-
1972, has risen rapidly. Consequently, the growth in oil revenues in this
period did not increase public savings as much as might have been expected.
In addition, the Government resorted to substantial borrowing from abroad.
As of December 1973, external debt outstanding was about $7.4 billion, of
which about $4.0 billion was disbursed; about 60 percent of this debt was
held by governments, private debt owed to foreign suppliers and private fi-
nancial institutions made up 30 percent, and the Bank accounted for the re-
maining 10 percent.
8.        The Fifth Plan, which came into effect on March 21, 1973, envisaged
a total investment program of Rials 2,460 billion (roughly $36 billion equiv-
alent), out of which Rials 912 billion was in the private sector and Rials
1,548 billion was for public development expenditures (including Rials 760
billion, or nearly half, in agriculture and the social sector). Following
the increase in oil prices during October 1973, the overall target for the
public development spending of the Fifth Plan was revised to Rials 1,909
billion (about $28 billion equivalent). Planners indicated that some 20
percent of the proposed program would have to be financed from foreign
sources but the situation changed radically with the further upward revision
of oil prices in December 1973. On the basis of present prices, oil revenues
during the Plan period could total as much as $68 billion (compared with es-
timates of $23 billion a year ago, on which the Plan was based). The ori-
ginal Plan had assumed oil revenues amounting to $3.1 billion in 1973 and
to $3.7 billion in 1974. It now appears that oil revenues would possibly
be in the order of $3.9 billion in 1973 and as much as $15 billion in 1974.
9.        The prospect of extremely high oil revenues over the coming years
has transformed both the short-term and the longer run prospects for the
balance of payments, as well as Iran's plans for development spending,
domestic resource mobilization and external borrowing. Almost overnight,
Iran changed from a capital-importing country to become a capital-exporting
country which has already indicated its willingness to provide financial
assistance both to developing and advanced countries in the new world
situation. However, development does not occur overnight. Iran still
faces the challenge of raising living standards equitably across the nation
and of providing the appropriate administrative and policy framework for
establishing a viable economy in the years towards the end of the century
when oil could play a less important role.
10.       During the period of the Fifth Plan, the Government has the unique
opportunity of being able to continue its objectives of rapid modernization
of the economy while at the same time ensuring that less-privileged Iranians
are provided with the means and the incentives to move from traditional, low-
productive occupations into more productive fields. This means, first, the
spread of high quality education to all corners of the land. Secondly, it
means more widespread provision of health and other social facilities. Third-
ly, it implies a greater decentralization of economic activity and the faster



- 4 -
growth of cities and regions outside Tehran. Fourthly, it involves a commit-
ment to transform traditional methods of agricultural production while en-
couraging further progress in commercial agriculture. And finally it implies
the stronger development of a basis for providing new sources of foreign ex-
change earnings, such as higher exports of manufactured goods, non-oil
minerals, petrochemicals or financial services.
11.       The projected current account surpluses also mean that the present
external debt no longer constitutes a problem. It could be paid off in any
number of ways, including complete redemption in one lump sum, without af-
fecting balance of payments equilibrium in the short or long run. By the
same token, there will no longer be any real need for the government to seek
financial assistance from abroad, although there will continue to be a need
for various kinds of technical assistance. Indeed, Iran is more likely to
become a net capital exporter. There is a strong possibility that capital
movements will increasingly take place in response to market incentives as in
most industrial countries. When that happens, the rate of long-term capital
inflows will be more a response to investment opportunities created by econo-
mic growth than an indicator of Iran's efforts to maintain balance in its ex-
ternal accounts. This inflows will reflect, among other things, the potential
growth of the domestic market and of exports of products other than oil.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN IRAN -/
12.       The Bank has made 28 loans to Iran, amounting to $987.5 million
(net of cancellations), of which $517.0 million has been disbursed and $225.0
million repaid by March 31, 1974. Annex II contains a summary statement of
Bank loans and IFC investments as of March 31, 1974; and some notes on the
execution of on-going projects.
13.       Until four years ago Bank lending to Iran, which began in 1957, had
been mainly for roads, irrigation, and industrial credit. However, since
1969, lending increased rapidly (from $70 million in FY69 to $149.5 million
in FY73), and has also been greatly diversified to cover power, telecommunica-
tion, ports, pipelines, agriculture, education and population. In addition,
a loan for urban transport was negotiated in FY73, and approved in early FY74.
14.       The first IFC investment in Iran was made in 1959 for a ceramic
tile plant. Since June 1969, IFC's activities in Iran have expanded rapidly
and it has made six investments in a steel products company, pulp and paper,
carbon black manufacturing, synthetic fibers, food products, and automobile
manufacturing. As of January 31, 1974, total IFC investments in Iran amounted
to US$38.7 million. IFC is also considering loans and investments for expan-
sion of nylon production, steel rolling and for the cement industries.
1/   Paragraphs 12-18 are identical to those included in Part II of my Report
to the Executive Directors on a Second Ports loan, dated May 6, 1974.



15.       Before the recent changes in the oil sector we had planned to main-
tain a high level of Bank lending to Iran during the next few years. These
plans have now been reconsidered following a series of discussions held in
Tehran in January and February, 1974. Our present plans, based on an agreed
new financial relationship reflecting Iran's dramatically changed circums-
tances, call for the continuation of a sizeable, but diminishing, volume of
Bank lending in the years ahead. At the Tehran meetings, the Iranian author-
ities first confirmed their desire to continue an active association with the
Bank because of the technical assistance and institutional building benefits
that they would obtain through project loans for high priority sectors re-
quiring substantial structural changes and administrative and financial im-
provements. Secondly, a new financial relationship has been worked out with
Iran, which would become a net lender to the Bank. Already a first loan of
$200 million from the Government of Iran to the Bank was signed on March 22,
1974 to achieve this objective. Further loans to the World Bank are expected
to follow. Apart from this type of lending, the Government has agreed to
"offset" periodically by additional loans to the Bank, any future commitments
the Bank would make to Iran. Thus, all loans approved from now on to the
end of the current fiscal year would be offset by a loan from Iran, equal to
our total commitments, on terms and conditions still to be negotiated. Loans
to be made in FY1975 would also be offset by Iranian loans to the Bank and/or
other methods agreeable to both sides.
16.       The thrust of Bank's activities - lending operations as well as
technical assistance - over the next two to three years would give special
emphasis to a more balanced regional development of Iran and would aim at
supporting the diversification of the economy to enable a smooth transition
towards an industrial and modern society. The Bank activities should concen-
trate mainly on agriculture and rural development, education, population and
nutrition, urbanization and, to a lesser extent, on industry and mining by
supporting two development finance companies, the Industrial Credit Bank
and the Development and Investment Bank of Iran and assisting in the estab-
lishment of a mining exploration fund.
17.       Improving the living conditions of the rural population is a major
target and the IBRD Agricultural Task Force has been set up to this end. Dur-
ing its first year of operation in Iran, the Task Force has concentrated on
developing a knowledge of Iranian agriculture and establishing a common under-
standing and full cooperation with the various ministries jointly preparing
projects, such as a small farm consolidation program, and livestock develop-
ment and agricultural credit to small farmers. It also is reviewing Govern-
ment schemes which aim at providing rural development centers and building
up rural industries, schemes which are being undertaken to generate employ-
ment, income, improved rural infrastructure and social amenities. It is
hoped that a pilot project based on these rural development centers schemes
being prepared jointly by the Government and the Task Force, would result in
a first rural and regional development project. A second major target is to
advise on methods and programs to organize and promote education and training.
At the request of the Government discussions are continuing on possible future
education project loans. It was agreed with the Iranian authorities to set
up an Iranian Education Task Force which is receiving advice and assistance
from Bank and UNESCO staff and which is expected to report in the coming



- 6 -
months as to the areas for future cooperation between Iran and the Bank in
education and training. Furthermore, as Iran tends to become highly urbanized,
decentralization away from Tehran and regional development and urbanization
programs become increasingly important. Urbanization projects (e.g. city
planning development, urban transport, water supply, sewerage), which would
largely benefit people with lower income are therefore being considered for
Bank lending, and an urban sector survey is planned for fall 1974. A water
supply and sewerage sector survey mission is now in the field to recommend
actions to improve facilities in the sector, particularly in the provinces
outside Tehran. Finally, given the necessity to reduce the high level of
population growth (3 percent net per annum), special attention is given to the
progress of the first population loan which could result in a second and much
larger project, and which would also fnclude a major nutrition component based
on the preparatory study financed under the first loan.
18.        In addition to the proposed loan, I am now also recommending a loan
for Ports and a second loan for the Iran Transmission and Power Generation
Company (TAVANIR) (reference my Reports of even date). We expect to pre-
sent to the Executive Directors, early FY1975, proposed loans for a fish-
eries project, for the Agricultural Development Bank of Iran (ADBI) and
for the Development and Investment Bank of Iran (DIBI). All these proj-
ects form part of the pipeline of cperations discussed and appraised
over the last 18 months. Some are repeater operations, such as the pro-
posed loans for TAVANIR and ADBI, others are new. All have a strong
institution-building and technical assistance component. The three agricul-
tural projects mentioned in para 17 are expected to be processed in the next
fiscal year together with a village electrification project. We have already
appraised the Lar Multipurpose Project for supplying water to Tehran. As
agreed with the Government we are also consideting for FY75 a possible loan
to a mining exploration fund.
PART III - INDUSTRIAL FINANCING IN IRAN
17.       For over a decade now, the industrial sector in Iran has been one
of the most dynamic in the economy. Real value added in manufacturing and
mining has increased by about 12 percent per year, compared with 10.2 percent
for the GNP. The faster growth of manufacturing compared to other sectors
has contributed to a change in the composition of the GNP; the share of manu-
facturing in GNP rose from 15 pesrcent in 1962 to 20 percent in 1972. The
performance of the industrial sector was facilitated by a major effort of the
Government -- which included provision of substantial financing for the sector
-- to industrialize and develop the economy. By the beginning of the 1970's,
about Rials 350 billion had been invested in industry, and 37 percent of it
was provided by the Government. (Foreign investment contributed Rials 8
billion to the total.)
18.       In the early 1960's the main objective of official policy was to
create an industrial sector based on modern technology. Economic efficiency
was a secondary consideration. Initially, private entrepreneurs were encou-
raged to engage in import substitution by means of high incentives. This



- 7 -
policy succeeded in stimulating the domestic production of consumer goods and,
to a much lesser extent, of producer goods. The total value of domestic
manufacturing production at current prices more than quadrupled between
1960/61 and 1969/70. By the end of the decade, the country had become self-
sufficient in most consumer goods. However, imports of intermediate and
capital goods increased sharply to provide the equipment, components and
materials required for industrial expansion.
19.       The Government's strategy for industrialization was modified for
the 1970's. It now emphasizes production of intermediate and capital goods,
further increases in efficiency in the durable good industry, vertical in-
tegration of industries, export-oriented ventures, minimum economic size and
competitiveness of new plants, progressive decentralization of industry away
from the Tehran area, greater attenticn to small and medium size industries,
transfer of certain state-owned enterprises to private hands, and the broad-
ening of the ownership through the sale of shares in industrial enterprises
to workers and the public at large. To achieve these ends, the Government
is employing several policy tools, including (i) an increase in the volume
of imports; (ii) reduction in protection levels; (iii) creation of an Export
Promotion Board; (iv) prohibition of new plants within a 120 kilometer radius
of the Tehran area; (v) tax exemptions for new industries located in areas
designated as new growth centers; (vi) additional Government credit to smaller
enterprises; and (vii) tax and other incentives for companies to broaden public
ownership. These policies are in conformity with the conclusions of Bank mis-
sions of 1970 and 1971, summarized in the report "Industrial Policies and
Priorities: Iran" dated March 1, 1972 (No. SA-27a).
20.       The industrial sector has experienced noticeable structural changes.
The increased scale of output and growing technological complexity of new
investments is shown by the larger average capitalization of firms commencing
operations -- from US$160,000 in the middle 1960's to some US$380,000 towards
the beginning of the 1970's. Whereas many new industries, though relatively
large in scale, were essentially simple assembly operations in the early 1960's,
the industrial sector as a whole has begun a process of backward integration.
The manufacturing of components, parts and intermediate products has become
increasingly feasible, thus broadening the base of industrial development.
New projects for building and construction industry and those based on petro-
leum have also been started, and there is an emerging production of capital
goods. Therefore, Iran has clearly moved from relatively simple import substi-
tution, to a much more complex stage of industrial production. The industrial
policy of the Government is highly geared towards rapid industrial growth and
diversification.
21.       The major sources of long-term industrial financing for industry
and mining are the Industrial and Mining Development Bank of Iran (IMDBI) and
ICB, which provide about 15 percent and 4 percent respectively of the total
financial requirements for private fixed capital formation. Sponsors typi-
cally supply another 40 percent, suppliers' credit and other foreign funds
25 percent; and commercial banks, bazaar, and other institutions the remainder.
Normally, IMDBI and ICB finance about 30 percent of total project cost and



- 8 -
they are involved in about 50 percent and 10 percent respectively of all
private industrial and mining investments. Whereas IMDBI and the newly estab-
lished Development and Investment Bank of Iran (DIBI) concentrate on the
larger scale manufacturing sector, ICB caters more to the smaller and medium
scale industries, which are generally more labor intensive and domestic
resource-based. 1/ This division of functions among the three DFC's should
be well suited to the needs of the country.
22.       In addition to direct investments in the industrial sector, the
Government is supporting private industry by lending to DFC's in Iran. These
efforts to channel public funds to private industry will undoubtedly increase
substantially in the near future, as a result of the dramatic rise in oil
revenues flowing to the Government. The Government has expressed the wish
that the Bank continue its support of DFC's in Iran because of the much
needed technical assistance that would thus be available to them.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
23.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Industrial Credit Bank" (317a-
IRN, dated May 1, 1974) is being distributed separately. A loan and project
summary is attached as Annex III. The project was appraised in February,
1972 and reappraised in October, 1973 after questions regarding interest rates
were resolved. Negotiations took place in Washington D.C. from April 8 to
April 16, 1974. The Iranian delegation was headed by H.E. Manouchehr Agah,
Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance and Dr. A.
N. Farmanfarmaian, Managing Director of ICB and further included Dr. Pour-Abbas,
Director, Ministry of Finance, Mr. Ghaziaskar, Executive Assistant, ICB, Mr.
Fazlollahi, Section Chief, ICB, and Mr. N. Safa-Esfahani, representative of
the Iranian Economic Mission in Washington.
The Company
24.       ICB was established in 1956 to replace the Plan Organization Bank 2/
which had been created in 1951 to serve the banking needs of the planning
agency in charge of coordination, selection, financing and implementation of
development projects submitted by the different ministries. ICB was also to
help develop private industry. The Second Plan Law authorized the Plan and
Budget Organization (PBO) to establish ICB as a joint stock company.
1/   Small-scale industry is defined as enterprises with fixed assets of
$50,000 - $500,000. Medium-scale industry is defined as enterprises
with fixed assets of $500,000 - $1.5 million.
2/   The Plan Organization (PO) has recently changed its name to the Plan
and Budget Organization (PBO).



- 9 -
25.       ICB's original objectives, set out in its statutes, were to promote
the development of industrial and mining firms in which private ownership was
50 percent or more. An amendment of ICB's statutes in February 1972 empower-
ed it to assist "industry, mining, transport and agro-industry and also de-
velopment projects in fields such as medical treatment, education, sport,
hotel management and tourism." The new sectors were included because they
are accorded high priority in the Fifth Five Year Plan and because no other
financial institution caters to their needs. ICB is empowered to extend
loans, purchase and sell shares, issue guarantees, provide technical assist-
ance and to borrow from domestic and foreign sources. In the period from
1961 to 1973, projects located in the provinces have received about 65 percent
of ICB's financial assistance thus contributing to the decentralization of
industry away from the Tehran area, in line with the policy of prohibiting
new plants within a 120 kilometer radius of Tehran. A promotion department
set up three years ago has identified and promoted the establishment of a
number of new projects. By concentrating in the provinces, on medium-scale
industrial opportunities, ICB has contributed to the expansion of industrial
employment, has broadened the base of industrial ownership in Iran and has
made investments in viable projects which otherwise might not have been
financed. During the Fourth Plan period (1969 to 1973) it is estimated
that ICB financed-projects resulted in total investments of about 18 billion
Rials or 10.2 percent of total gross fixed capital formation in industries
and mines. These projects are estimated to have provided employment for
about 24,000 people at an average investment of about $10,000 per worker.
26.       A comprehensive policy statement has been drafted in consultation
with the Bank. It defines ICB's policies regarding matters such as lending
to small and medium-sized enterprises, interest policy, foreign exchange risk
and financial limits on loans and equity investments. The policy statement
was adopted by ICB's Board on May 1, 1974.
27.       The balance sheet as of March 20, 1974 shows total assets of
Rials 14,118 million (US$207 million) excluding Managed Funds which amounted
to Rials 18,846 million (US$277 million) at that date. Of ICB's total assets
of March 20, 1974, the loan portfolio represents 67 percent, the equity
portfolio 13 percent, and liquid funds 20 percent. Of liabilities and equity,
16 percent of the total was provided by foreign banks, 50 percent by local
sources and the remaining 34 percent by equity. Almost all local funds are
provided by the Government.
Management and Organization
29.       The Board, which is composed entirely of Government representatives,
closely controls ICB's affairs. It meets once a week to consider loans and
investments and to discuss policy issues. Since ICB receives a substantial
amount of public funds, the Government has a great interest in its operations.
ICB's Board includes some of Iran's most senior public servants, who see to
it that sound banking principles are generally applied to ICB's operations.
Although ICB in its operations follows the Government's policies, this is not
in conflict with its applying sound banking principles. However, as a Govern-
ment-owned bank, it is in a position to support projects which a purely



- 10 -
private bank might not be willing to consider. This particularly applies to
projects which face financial difficulties, or which are more costly to ad-
minister, for example smaller projects. In the few instances where ICB was
requested to finance non-bankable projects, specific "managed" funds were
made available to conduct the operation. 1/ In general, however, ICB's Board
has applied rather strict banking principles and has in fact been very security-
oriented.
30.       Despite some weaknesses - mainly reflected in organizational mat-
ters and in appraisal standards - management has been able to give an accept-
able measure of leadership in the past years. The Managing Director, Dr. A.N.
Farmanfarmanian, is a banker with experience, and has proven to be competent
in handling the considerable growth of the company's operations. ICB has
been administered properly and the investment decisions have been, on the
whole, appropriate. The relationship with the Bank, and the discipline that
it imposes, should provide ICB's staff - of generally good quality and with
readiness and ability to learn - with some of the backing it needs to make
needed improvements.
Record of Operations
31.       From FY 1960 through FY 1974, ICB has committed loans and equity
investments, including guarantees, amounting to Rials 25,512 million (US$375
million equivalent). Total commitments in the period of FY61-74 for long-
term loans amounted to Rials 11.2 billion, for working capital loans to Rials
7.2 billion and for equity investments to Rials 3.2 billion. Commitments
have more than quadrupled in FY 1974 as compared to FY 1972. ICB's total
equity operations increased almost five times over the level of March 1971,
reaching Rials 1,865 million (US$27 million) as of March 1974. ICB has
financed a few very large projects but its business has been mainly with
the medium-sized enterprises and to a lesser extent with small-sized farms.
Of some 350 companies financed by ICB since its inception, about 210 companies
are estimated to have assets below $300,000, while another 120 enterprises
have assets below $1 million. The average size of ICB's long-term loan was
$308,000. ICB continues to emphasize the more traditional labor intensive
and resource-based industries. In the period FY61-73 !CB's long-term com-
mitments were made to the following type of industries: construction mate-
rials with 24 percent, paper and paper products with 14 percent, textiles
with 13 percent, foodstuffs with 12 percent and metallurgicals with 11 per-
cent of the committed amounts, including working capital loans.
32.       In the past, ICB followed a policy of low interest rates ranging
from seven to eight percent per annum. However, rates were recently increased
to take account of the prevailing interest rates in the country, the economic
1/   Funds administered by ICB, on behalf of the Government of Iran, for
which it receives commissions varying between 1/2 and 2 percent of the
outstanding amounts which more than covers ICB's costs.



- 11 -
cost of capital and the increasing cost of ICB's own resources. Its present
interest rate is 9 percent per annum on long-term loans, including a service
charge of 1/2 percent. This rate is generally in line with those of other
comparable institutions in Iran, although slightly lower than thatf now
charged by IMDBI. However, as is the case with IMDBI, ICB charges 10% to
all projects located in the Tehran region, while the rate oi is is enarged to
projects in the provinces, and 8-1/2 percent to companies with fixed assets
below about US$500,000. This is appropriate in view of ICB's policy to en-
courage projects outside Tehran, and to help develop smaller projects. Up to
March 20, 1973 about 55 percent of the long-term loans were made to enterprises
in the provinces and the remainder to enterprises in the Tehran area. More
than 66 percent of ICB's loans were with repayment periods of between 5 to 10
years.
33.       ICB's appraisals cover the engineering and market aspects reasonably
well, but are deficient in their review of financial and economic aspects.
Supervision of projects under construction is well done, but needs to be
more systematic for projects in operation. ICB's management is aware of
this and is developing plans to deal with it, but the large number of these
projects (over 200) and staff constraints have so far limited immediate im-
provements. ICB wants to introduce improvements in all these respects, and
its progress will be closely supervised by the Bank.
34.       Although ICB's project analysis for promoted projects is suffering
from some of the same deficiencies mentioned above, promotion is still one of
ICB's better features, and good projects have emerged as a result. Procure-
ment practices are satisfactory.
Financial Results
35.       The Income Statement for FY74 and the projected income and expenses
up to 1979 are shown in Annex III, page 3. The most important aspect is that
ICB is in a high tax bracket, i.e., 60 percent of income. This is so because
ICB shares are not quoted on the Stock Exchange and because ICB has less than
100 shareholders. This factor reduced income before-tax and provisions from
14 percent on average net worth in FY74 to 5.6 percent after-tax and to 4.4
percent after tax and provisions. Opportunities to increase ICB's after-tax
profits are, therefore, limited. In the past the cost of borrowing by ICB
has been minimal (averaging 3 percent on outstanding loans) because most of
the Government funds were in the form of equity. Recently, however, this
cost has increased, reflecting ICB's increasing recourse to internal and ex-
ternal borrowing. Administrative expenses have been kept within reasonable
limits, 1.4 percent of ICB's average total assets. Indeed, income from ad-
ministering Managed Funds totalled Rials 260 million in FY74, about 20 percent
of total income, and covered 75 percent of ICB's total administrative expenses.
ICB's portfolio is of good quality and its provisions are based on a conserv-
ative loan-by-loan review, which can be considered prudent. ICB has never
experienced any write-offs and none are anticipated.

Audit
36.       ICB's original auditors were not satisfactory to the Bank.    Despite
the deficiencies in the auditors' reports, the analysis of ICB's operations
and financial statements indicate that internally ICB's accounts are satis-
factorily maintained. In view of this fact, and ICB's satisfactory level of
provisions no fresh audit is recommended before a loan to ICB is made. In
March 1973 the Government decided that all public sector companies, includ-
ing ICB, should be audited by auditors acceptable to the Government Audit-ing
Company which has a supervisory function. Accordingly, in early 1974, ICB
selected Amin and Co., as its new auditors. The firm, associated with Price-
Waterhouse, is highly reputable in Iran. ICB agreed to have its accounts and
financial statements for each year, starting with FY1974, audited in accord-
ance with sound auditing principles, consistently applied, by these auditors,
which are acceptable to the Bank.
Future Operations and Required Resources
37.       The growth prospects for ICB continue to be good in view of the high
priority given to industrial development in Iran. To achieve continued high
rates of growth, substantial investments in industry will be required. Pri-
vate investments in industry are expected to grow at an average annual rate
of 25 - 30 percent in real terms. ICB is regarded as the prime financier
of the small and medium-sized enterprises. The number of ICB's projects
is increasing constantly, leading to increased requirements for funds. ICB
has a substantial pipeline of some 60-65 projects presently under considera-
tion. Long-term approvals are expected to grow from Rials 8.3 million in
FY75 to Rials 17.1 billion in FY79. This makes for a 20 percent annual growth
rate which is below that expected for private industrial investment as a whole.
Commitments will follow the growth of approvals, increasing from Rials 7.7
billion in FY75 to Rials 15.9 billion in FY79. Equity investments, which
rose from Rials 8 million in FY72 to Rials 1.2 billion in FY74, are expected
to grow more evenly at the rate of 10 percent from Rials 1.3 billion in FY74
to Rials 2.0 billion in FY79. A yearly commitment of Rials 50 million has
been forecast for other local currency operations such as ICB's assistance
to schools, hotels and medical facilities. ICB's forecast is realistic as
it merely maintains ICB's share in total industrial finance. In the short
run, however, the ability of ICB's management and staff to process business
is a brake on possibly higher expectations.
38.       On the basis of the above projections, ICB will need Rials 65.9
billion (about $970 million equivalent) to cover its expected commitments for
the five year period FY75-79, of which Rials 34.4 billion (about $500 million
equivalent) would be in foreign exchange resources. The Government of Iran
has advised the Bank that in light of the new economic situation following
the rise in oil prices, and under its present policy it would not allow ICB
to borrow in the international capital markets. Consequently, the Government
has advised the Bank that it will finance all of ICB's needs as presently
forecast and approved by the Government.



- 13 -
39.       Over the two year period FY75-76, ICB's financing needs are expected
to be Rials 19.9 million, out of which Rials 10.2 to finance imports. As
against these needs, ICB had Rials 270 million available for commitment at
end FY74, and cash generated during the period will amount to about Rials 2.3
billion. PBO loans are expected to total about Rials 15 billion for the two-
year period. ICB forecasts that only Rials 600 million of its tied lines of
credit will be available for commitments during the period. The Government
and ICB are looking to the Bank to cover the resulting resource gap of about
Rials 1.7 billion ($25 million equivalent). Such a loan would cover about 8
percent of ICB's overall resource needs, and about 17 percent of its import
finance requirements up to March 1976. After FY76, ICB envisages another
loan from the Bank as well as further utilization of its tied lines of credit.
If the policy described in para 38 above is maintained, PBO allocations for
the following three years should amount to about Rials 35 billion; this amount
should not be difficult to provide to ICB by the Government in light of the
situation and prospects of the Iranian economy.
40.       Prior Bank approval would be necessary for each sub-project requiring
Bank funds in excess of $200,000, with an aggregate free limit of $6.25 million
(Section 2.02 (b) of the Draft Loan Agreement). This would ensure that the
Bank will review about 65 percent of the sub-projects in number, and not less
than 75 percent of the total amount of the proposed loan. The maximum amount
of Bank funds to be used for a single investment project is $3.5 million. We
were informed during negotiations that the Government would assume the risk
on the foreign exchange exposure of ICB. ICB will observe a maximum debt/
equity limit of 4:1.
Justification
41.       Iran is at a crucial juncture in its development.    The dramatic
rise in oil revenues will enable it to sustain and in some instances even
increase the already extremely high growth rate. Industrial growth will
remain one of the most important elements in the Iranian economy. The
Government's overall economic and industrial policies are appropriate for
the stage of the country's growth. The Government is devoting much more
attention than in the past to small and medium sized enterprices and ICB's
organization, staffing and its relations with the Government and the business
community make it particularly suitable for financing these types of projects.
ICB has processed a large number of projects per year (40-60) and has played
an important role in the industrial development process of the country. ICB's
investments are economically sound and have contributed significantly to
employment, especially in the less-developed provinces where the creation of
new jobs is a part of rural development and a contribution to the decentraliza-
tion of industry away from the Tehran area. The average investment per worker
of ICB's projects has been $10,000 even including some very capital intensive
projects. The average capital cost per new job compares favorably with the
experience of other DFC-financed sub-projects in the Region (ranging between
$7,000 and $39,000).
42.       For the future, ICB's continued growth is not expected to be con-
strained by a lack of demand for the financing and other services it offers.



- 14 -
While weaknesses still exist in ICB, the company has sufficiently strong base
and capabilities to correct its shortcomings. The company's financial posi-
tion and profitability are satisfactory and its portfolio is sound. The
main objective of the Bank loan is to help ICB to expand its operations on an
economically and financially sound basis by improving its appraisal standards,
information systems and overall planning and financial management. The Bank's
technical assistance is considered essential towards this end. The Government
shares this view. It has specifically expressed the wish that the Bank con-
tinue its support of DFCs in Iran for that reason.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
43.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Industrial Credit
Bank, the draft Guarantee Agreement between Iran and the Bank, the Report of
the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft agreements
are in the standard form for loans to development finance companies.
44.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
45.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1,
Loan No. 517; Ghazvin Development; US$11.0 million, Loan of October 17, 1967;
Closing Date:  June 30, 1974            _  _         _   _
The progress of construction, pace of development and quality of
supervision under the Project are generally satisfactory. The loan amount
was reduced by half in 1971 due to the reduction in the scope of the Project
and more local procurement than had been originally anticipated. On comple-
tion of Stage II, which is now being carried out by the Borrower with its
own resources, a total of 52,000 ha (including 26,000 ha under Stage I) will
be fully developed. Because of a reduction in some elements of the project
for technical and financial reasons, utilization of the funds has been some-
what slow. In order to enable the Borrower to utilize the undisbursed funds
for a proposed purchase of agricultural equipment and material, the Closing
Date has been postponed for a third time to June 30, 1974. A supervision
mission has reviewed the final implementation of the project.
Loan No. 594; Dez Irrigation; US$28.0 million, Loan of April 18, 1969;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1974-
The progress of the agricultural development is proceeding at an
improved rate. The decision of the Ministry of Cooperatives and Rural Af-
fairs to pay KWPA to level 6000 ha of land in the farm cooperatives area
within three years instead of the 10 years previously planned is very en-
couraging. The rate of development of the land by three of the four agri-
business companies is progressing satisfactorily. The drainage program in
the south of the Dez Pilot Irrigation Project (DPIP) will be completed by
May 1974. The expansion of the Agricultural Research Center is completed
but professional staffing is not up to strength.
Loan No. 697; Roads V; US$40.0 million, Loan of June 29, 1970:
Closing Date:  June 30, 1975
The revision of the Government's bid evaluation procedures delayed
the award of most of the thirteen road construction projects; all are well in
progress and three have been completed satisfactorily. There were also lengthy
delays in Government awarding two consultants contracts for the Transport Co-
ordination Study and the Road Maintenance Study. However, Phase I of each
has now been completed. Procurement of road maintenance equipment to the
value of US$6 million, identified by the Road Maintenance Study, will com-
mence shortly. In March 1971 consultants commenced work on the Tehran Urban
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Transport Study, and in July 1972 recommended an Immediate Action Program.
This program formed the basis of a loan approved in August 1973.
The rate of disbursements, initially slow, accelerated as road con-
struction came into full swing, and is now satisfactory.
Loan No. 716; Tehran Power Distribution; US$60.0 million
Loan of December 18, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1974
The project is proceeding satisfactorily. All major contracts
have been placed and about 50% of the planned distribution and transmission
facilities have been installed. About 100,000 new customers have been con-
nected. Although disbursements are behind schedule, they have accelerated
considerably during FY 73 and the loan is more than 50 percent disbursed.
There are still major accounting problems at TREC preventing the issuance
of an audit certificate. These are being studied by the consultants.
Loan No. 717; Telecommunications I; US$36.0 million Loan of December 18, 1970;
Closing Date:  March 31, 1975                               _      -
Good progress is being made with exchange installations in the
Tehran area and the targets may be exceeded; works for provincial exchanges
and telex networks are behind schedule by about a year. Disbursements under
the loan have accelerated and the bulk of the loan amount has been committed.
Loan No. 718; Education I; US$19.0 million, Loan of December 18, 1970;
Closing Date:  June 30, 1977
The project is progressing satisfactorily. The implementation of
the project is about five months behind schedule due to delays in the selec-
tion of consultant architects. However, the Project Unit is functioning
satisfactorily. The disbursement schedule has been revised and envisages
an increase in disbursements in the next year.
Loan No. 805; Pipeline; US$32.0 million, Loan of March 3, 1972;
Closing Date:  June 30, 1975
After some initial delay due to the reorganization of the Engineer-
ing Department of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), the contract for
the construction of the Rey-Tabriz oil pipeline and the contract for the
Ahwaz-Rey crude oil pipeline were awarded in March 1973. However, due to
the review of requirements for the Rey-Mashad section, work on this line has
been delayed and the NIOC is considering alternative proposals for expansion
of the Rey-Mashad system to cope with the demand in North-Eastern Iran.
Loan No. 821; Agricultural Credit - ADFI II; US$14.5 million, Loan of May 22,
1972; Closing Date:  November 30, 1976        _ _   _-
The loan became effective on September 25, 1972 and by March 31,
1974, almost 50 percent had been disbursed. It is expected that the accele-
rated rate of disbursements will continue. The institution has requested a
third loan for commitments over the period May 1974/76.



ANNEX II

Loan No. 855; Ports; US$29.0 million; Loan of September 8, 1972;
Closing Date: April 30, 1978
Implementation of all elements of the project is proceeding satis-
factorily. Improvements in PSOS organization and financial structure have
been made and the Ports Master Plan Study will be completed on schedule by
July 1974. A contract for a comprehensive training program has been concluded
with World ORT Union. All contracts for civil works, floating craft and cargo-
handling equipment have been let and are proceeding satisfactorily. Disburse-
ments, although behind schedule are expected to accelerate now that all work
is under contract and are progressing satisfactorily.
Loan No. 856; Power Transmission; US$51.0 million, Loan of September 20, 1972;
Closing Date:  March 31, 1977      __                 _    _        _     -
The procurement for the 400/230-kV transmission facilities associated
with the Reza Shah Kabir 1000-MW hydro-station has been delayed because of
extension to the project and design changes introduced by the Iranians, but
most of the major contracts are now awarded and disbursements should soon
accelerate. The project cost is now estimated to be about 33 percent above
the appraisal estimate due to the changes and the recent general price es-
calations. Institutional improvement with TAVANIR, the borrower, have been
slower than expected. A major training program is still not implemented but
negotiations with prospective training consultants are underway.
Loan No. 927; Telecommunications II; US$82 million, Loan of August 9, 1973;
Closiug Date:  March 20, 1976
The Loan became effective from December 4, 1973. A mission has
recently returned from the field where they reviewed progress under the proj-
ect. The Bank has received the required information.
Loan No. 928; Population; US$16.5 million; Loan of August 9, 1973;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1976         _          ___    _
Project implementation has commenced but at a slow pace. Manage-
ment study contract is being worked out.
