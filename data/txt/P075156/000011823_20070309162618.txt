1.    Preamble
The public consultation process related to the new discharge waters of the Saranda CTW
engendered the following concems:
on As Ksamili settlement and some other smaller settlements get water supply from the
wells near Cuka canal, WB wants to know which could be the long term or any impact
of the new CTW discharge at Cuka canal;
How is the situation of groundwater/aquifer layers in relation with the influence of this
new discharge to Cuka canal;
Is it expected to have infiltration in the aquifer due to the new solution at Cuka canal?
2.    Background
Currently the wastewater collected in the Saranda town is lifted by a pumping station,
located near the former Butrinti Hotel, up-to the Bistri,a river (Cuka Canal), with an out-fall
located close to the existing bridge on the river (Cuka Bridge n. 1 - see photo 1).
The Saranda CTW final design includes the following solution for the future effluent
discharging:
; Pumped Out-fall into Bistrica river: the effluent will be discharged in the Cuka canal
by a pumping station, with the new proposed out-fall located 1,75 km upstream the
existing sewage out-fall (see photo 2). The new sewage out-fall is located at 2,5 Km
up-steam from the sea out-fall;
g. Emeraency Gravity out-fall in the Butrinti Lake: mergency CTW out-fall by gravity
into an existing open drainage discharging, via an existing hydrovore, in the Butrinti lake
and then to the sea (see photo 3). The emergency out-fall will be used onlyi n case of
effluent pumping station failure
In the following general layout the existing and future situation is shown as above detailed.

3.   Hydraulic and water quality characteristic of the Bistri,a river (Cuka canal)
During Project preparation (May, 2002) water quality sampling and hydrometric measure has
been preformed in the Cuka canal. The results can be summarized as follow:
Flow measurement: Q=15.2 m3/s; (width=25 m; average depth=0.90 m).
cr' Water quality analysis: Tab. 3.1 summarized water quality analysis sampled close
the Cuka canal mouth.

Moreover the calculated probability of exceeding for the Bistrica river discharges are shown
in the following table 3.3:

4.   CTW expected effluent water quality
In Tab. 4.1 the expected effluent water quality of the Saranda WWTP is shown. The
Treatment Performance or Removal Efficiency (RE%) of the WWTP is a ratio of the outgoing
concentration versus the ingoing concentration of wastewater substances.

lSS            400               14.8         96
The expected Fecal Coliform Removal Efficiency (by considering preliminary treatment,
Oxidation pond and Wetland) is expected to be ranging between 92-97% as shown in the
next Table 4.2 (hydraulic retention time about 12 days):

Assuming a Fecal Coliform in-let concentration of  1*107 MPN/100 ml (typical urban
wastewater concentration), the FC effluent concentration will be 3*1 05 MPN/100 ml.
5.  Wastewater effect of residual wastewater on the Cuka canal fresh water
Pollutant & Nutrient
By considering an Cuka canal flow discharge of 10.5 m3/s (lowest expected flow, 95%
probability of exceeding), the dilution rate, between the receptor flow discharge and the
average WWTP effluent flow-rate (85 I/s), result 120 times (10,500/85=123).
Fecal
According the Final Design calculation, the expected increasing on the FC receptor
concentration due to the WWTP outfall diluted results in 2,500 MPN/100 ml.
By considering the expected insignificant concentration of the pathogen bacteria in the plant
out fall, it is possible to discharge directly the treated water into the Bistrica river, without any
relevant health risk constrains.
Nevertheless a treated wastewater disinfections unit has been included for he Saranda plant.
Before the plant out fall the waste-residual-water will disinfected by a water chlorination

system, including an hypo chlorite dosing pump, residual chlorine meter and de-chlorination
unit.
Assuming that the removal efficiency of the chlorination unit will be  99.99%  the Fecal
Coliform effluent concentration is shown in the following table 5.2:

It's necessary to note that at present the raw sewage is discharged directly to the Cuka Canal
without any treatment so that the future discharge of the WWTP out-fall will increase the fresh
water quality of the Cuka Canal.
6.   Wastewater effect of treated wastewater on the existing wells in the Cuka area
In the Saranda area can be distinguished two main aquifers: limestone karst aquifer and
gravelly porous aquifer.
The Saranda limestone mountain strip represents a karst aquifer, which due to the intensive
fissuring and karstification has a distinctly high permeability. The intensive infiltrated
precipitation in the limestone formations is short way discharged into the lonian Sea without
forming important springs.
Mainly Quaternary fluvial deposits, which maximal thickness is about 250 m (in the southern
sector of the plain), fill up the Vurgu Plain. These deposits consist of alternated gravely and.
clayey layers. The transmissibility of the gravely layers is generally high to very high,
particularly in the northern sector of the Vurgu Plain where it is about 8000 m2/d. The yield of
the wells varies from 10-20 I/s up to more then 100 I/s. Two wells total capacity 150 I/s
located about 4-km northeast to Saranda, near Vrioni village, are used for the city water
supply.
In the figure in next page the location of existing main wells in the Saranda area are shown:
Saranda wells and Cuka wells.
The Saranda water supply wells are situated about 5 km north to CTW location, or 3 Km
north to the CTW out-fall into Bistrica canal. The water supply wells are situated up-stream, so
it is excluded any possibility for groundwater to be effected by the residual wastewater
discharged into the Cuka canal.
The Cuka water supply wells are located about 2 km north to the CTW location, and at 550 m
up-stream from the CTW discharging point into Bistri,ca canal. As above, due the up-stream
position of the wells, no influence on groundwater/aquifer layers is expected. In addition, it is
necessary to consider that the Cuka well gravel aquifer is well protect by an impermeably
clayey layer of about 25-30 m.
As shown on the map the CTW residual treated wastewater will be discharged at 2.5 Km
upstream of the Bistri,a out-fall in open sea.
As per previous chapter the residual pathogen bacteria concentration discharged in Bistriga are
in a insignificant level, with an expected increasing of Fecal Coliform concentration on the Cuka
fresh water less than 0.24 (MPN/100ml).
Moreover, it is necessary to consider that the related pollutant "retention time" on the fresh
water of Bistrica river (before to reach the open sea) is very low (river stretch of 2500 m, and
stream average velocity of 3 m/s: 2500/3=0,23 h), not reasonable enough to effect any
aquifer layers.
According above, no impact is expected on groundwater/aquifer layers in relation with the
influence of the proposed new discharge of waste-residual-water on the Cuka canal.

7.  Wastewater effect on Butrinti lake during Emergency condition
In case of CTW out-fall pumping station failure, due lack of power supply or fault of the
electro-mechanical devices, the waste-residual-water will be discharged by gravity into an
existing open drainage channel, via an existing hydrovore, in the Butrinti lake and then to the
sea.
The existing open drain has a total length of 2.0 km, between the WWTP location and the
Butrinti Lake, and has a discharge between 2.0 m3/s and 5.0 m3/s. By considering the above
receptor flow discharge and the high dilution rate (2000-5000 / 85 I/s = 25-60 times), also in
this case the pollutant concentration becomes insignificant once in Butrinti lake inflow.
It's noted that the receptor channel is effective as a suspended solid trap, and therefore, a
trap for sediment-bound nutrients and pesticides: nutrients that bind the suspended solids
include mainly phosphorous and ammonium. According as above it's expected that along the
2.0 km drain channel a large amount of phosphorous could be deposited before to reach the
Butrinti Lake and then adsorbed by biological and chemical process in the trapped materials.
According the Final Design calculation the expected surplus FC receptor concentration due to
the dilution results 12,000-5,000 MPN/100 ml. The above marginal FC concentrations
become insignificant in the final receptor of Butrinti Lake, also by considering that the
pathogen survival time in fresh water (20°-30°) is between 10-30 days.
Next table 6.1 and 6.2 show the bacterial analysis made on Butrinti lake water and shellfish
samples.2

8. Conclusions
The above calculations doesn't reveal any negative impact or influence on the
groundwater/aquifer and on any existing facilities interesting the water supply of the
settlements in the both foreseen solutions analyzed.
In detail to reply to the questions arose during the Public Consultation Process:
As Ksamili settlement and some other smaller settlements get water supply from the wells
near Cuka canal, WB wants to know which could be the long term or any impact of the
new CTW discharge at Cuka canal: No impact is exDected.
How is the situation of groundwater/aquifer layers in relation with the influence of this new
discharge to Cuka canal. No influence on roundw terla uifer Iaves is ex ected.
'. Is it expected to have infiltration in the aquifer due to the new solution at Cuka canal? No
infiltration in the aauifer is exDected.
Also to responds to the WB question about influence of new discharge point to Cuka Chanel on
the wells in neighboring village based on above calculation and arguments the conclusion is:
*  The Saranda water supply wells are situated about 5 km north to CTW location, or 3
Km north to the CTW out-fall into Bistrica canal. The water supply wells are situated up-
stream, so it is excluded any possibility for groundwater to be effected by the residual
wastewater discharged into the Cuka canal.
*  The Cuka water supply wells are located about 2 km north to the CTW location, and at
550 m up-stream from the CTW discharging point into Bistri,a canal. As above, due the
up-stream position of the wells, no influence on groundwater/aquifer layers is expected.
In addition, it is necessary to consider that the Cuka well gravel aquifer is well protect
by an impermeably clayey layer of about 25-30 m.
