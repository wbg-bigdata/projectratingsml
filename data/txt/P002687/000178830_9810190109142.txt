TANZANIA
SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
StTh4ARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Tanzania Government has placed high priority on agriculture and
rural development in its Second Five Year Plan (1969-74). Livestock is one
of the key subsectors and the proposed Project is in line with Government's
plan for it. Under the plan emphasis is being placed on improving the live-
stock marketing and distribution system, constructing slaughterhouses in the
major cattle areas, and developing Ujamaa cooperative and parastatal ranches.
The Project would increase beef Production bv developing ranches and by
providing essential infrastructure, including markets, stock routes and hold-
ing grounds, and meat nrocessing plants, the lack of which has reduced off-
take in the large traditional herd to less than 3%.
ii.       The Project would he the second IDA credit for livestock develop-
ment in Tanzania, the first having been made in 1968 for UJS1.3 million.
Under that prolect, which is now progressing satisfactorily, cattle production
is being increased on parastatal ranches operated hy the NaLtional Agriculture
Company (NACO). Three other credits have also been extended to Tanzania for
agricultural development - USS5 million was Drovided in 1965 for agricultural
credit; US$9 million in 1970 for flue-cured tobacco; and US$10.8 million in
1972 for smallholder tea. The first of these which is fully disbursed ex-
perienced difficulties due to weakness in the credit institution, since re-
organized, the second is now progressing satisfactorily though development
is behind schedule, and the third only recently became effective.
iii.      The Project would develop 11 parastatal (NACO) ranches, four
District DeveloDment Corporation ranches, snonsored by district councils
and 22 Ujamaa cooperative ranches; develop three large livestock markets,
10 medium-size markets, and 20 small markets and remodel 104 small existing
markets; develop 2,300 km of new stock routes and improve 2,200 km of existing
stock routes, and establish four new holding grounds and improve 23 existing
ones; reconstruct one meat processing plant and build two new ones; and pro-
vide technical services and training, and future project preparation work.
iv.       Project cost is estimated at US$24.7 million and covers a five-
year period, from 1973 to 1978. The IDA credit of US$18.5 million would
finance foreign exchange costs of USS11.3 million and aboul: half of local
currency costs at US$7.2 million.  Government would on-lend funds under the
IDA credit to the Tanzania Rural Development Bank (TRDB) for a term of 20
years, including a grace period of five years, with interest charged at 4%
per annum, the rate obtaining under previous IDA lending through TRDB. TRDB
would be the lending channel for loans to Project beneficiaries. On-lending
terLs would not exceed 12 years with a grace period of six years for ranch
development loans and 3 years for meat processing and livestock marketing.
Interest on all loans would be charged at 8-1/2% D.a. Funds for technical
services and machinery for the Government Tsetse Control Unit would remain
with Government.



- ii -
v.        A Project Management uTnit would be estahlished in the Ministry of
Agriculture to coordinate and supervise Project implementation and would
incltide a Project Manager, an economist, and a range management water
specialist. The Project Manager would be responsible to a policy committee
chaired by the Principal Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, and, since the
Project comprises a number of components both geographically and organiza-
tionally dispersed, an executive committee would be formed to ensure coor-
dination and implementation of works. The Project Manager would be its
chairman.
vi.       International competitive bidding would be used for the construc-
tion of two meat Drocessing plants by turn-key contracts - about US$4.1
million; remodelling of one meat processing plant - about ITS$ 0.6million;
for procurement of all heavy equipment and machinery for the tsetse control
unit and for tractors and machinerv used on ranches - about US$3 million;
and on all contracts exceeding US$30,000. Existing commercial channels would
be used for purchase of a broad range of miscellaneous items, and cattle
would be purchased locally.
vii.      The estimated financial rate of return to the beneficiaries'
incremental investments would range from 147 to 26%, while the rate of re-
turn to the Tanzanian economy is estimated at 35%. The Project at maturity
is expected to increase annual beef production by about 10,000 no   tons from
Project ranches, and the stock routes, holding grounds, and the marketing
component would increase marketed offtake from the traditional herd hy about
11,000 m tons. The increase in foreign exchange sales at full development
is estimated at USS6 million annually.  Newz jobs would be created for about
2,500 people, and about 700 families would participate in the ujamaa ranch
cooperatives.
viii.     Apart from Ujamna ranches, the Project would be channelled through
Government owned comnanies and therefore most of its benefits would accrue
to Government as profit and tax revenues. The Project will directly benefit
the small cattle owners on: Mamaa ranches and wage employees on ranches, meat
processing plants and in livestock marketing. In addition, the livestock
marketing and meat processing components would provide significant benefits
to traditional cattle producers on a countrywide basis.
ix.       The Project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$18.5 million.
Government would be the Borrower and would bear the foreign exchange risk.



TANZANIA
SECOND LIP1ESTOCK DEVELOPMFNT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Tanzania has placed high Driority on agriculture
and rural develonment in its Second Five-Year Plan (1969-74):  Its goals
include the organization of rural economic activity on socialist lines, both
through Ujamaa 1/ cooperatives and the expansion of other cooperative acti-
vity, to bring about social change to be achieved through a planned program
for expansion of crons and livestock based on disseminationi of modern agri-
cultural techniques. To these ends, Government is giving priority to the
expansion of rural credit, in part through the creation of a regional devel-
ODment fund, development of cooperatives, and the formation of District
Development Councils (DDC's). The Tanzania Rural Development Bank (TRDB)
is giving priority to projects submitted by Uiamaa cooperaitives, other
cooneratives, and DDC's and the programs for rural water supplies and rural
housing imnrovement will continue to give priority to Ujamaa villages.
Livestock (particularly beef ranching) is one of the key suib-sectors to be
developed because of its potential for expansion.
1.02      As part of its plan, Government has requested assistance in financing
a second stage of its livestock development program, begun under an IDA
assisted project in 1968. Under the project, which is on-going and orogressing
satisfactorily, five large scale National Agricultural Company (NACO) ranches
are being developed.  Government's original request comprised continued NACO
support and substantial development of Iljanaa and ranches sponsored by the
DDC's together with a Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccine production plant,
and marketing and processing facilities.  During and following appraisal, the
Government reduced the emphasis on Ujamaa ranches while the appraisal mission
found that further reductions to this and the DDC ranches were prudent in the
light of inadequate experience with this type of development and could not
find justification for FMD vaccine manufacturing. The Project now proposed
would continue to support NACO and would influence production on a broader
basis by including marketing and processing facilities and limited provision
for Ujamaa cooperative and DDC ranches.
1.03      The proposed IDA credit would be the fifth for the agriculture sec-
tor in Tanzania: US$5 million was provided in 1966 for agricultural credit
and is fully disbursed; it experienced difficulties due mainly to weakness
in the credit institution, since reorganized, although the project was tech-
nically sound; US$1.3 million was provided in 1968 for livestock development
and is progressing satisfactorilv (para 2.25); US$9 million was provided in
1970 for a flue-cured tobacco project which after some organizational dif-
ficulties is now progressing satisfactorily; and USS10.8 million provided in
March 1972 for smallholder tea became effective only recently.
1/  JUjamaa is a Swahili word meaning "familyhood".



1.04      The proposed Project was vrepared bv the Ministry of Agriculture,
with assistance from the staff of the Permanent MAission for Eastern Africa
and international consultants. This report is based on the findings of an
IDA appraisal mission to Tanzania in February-March 1972, composed of
Messrs. Walshe, Hussain, and Wiorker (IDA) and Abercrombie, Valdes, Wolffelt,
and Mrs. Reining (Consultants).
II.  BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Tanzania extends from the Indian Ocean to its western boundaries
with Zaire, Rwanda, and Burundi (Map).  Zanzibar, lying 30 miles off the
coast, is part of the Repuiblic. 2The total area of mainland Tanzania is
361,800 square miles (937,000 km ), including 20,650 square miles (53,500 km-)
of inland water, and, except for a narrowB strip of land along its 550-mile
(900 km) coastline, lies at an altitude of over 300 m. A large part of the
country is a plateau of about 1,300 m, xith mountainous areas rising to about
3,000 m on its southern and northeastern borders.
Climate
2.02      Tanzania has a tropical equatorial climate, with a wide range of
climatic and ecological conditions due to the different altitudes and the
location relative to the ocean and inland lakes. Mfean daily temperatures
range between 22°C and 32°C, with the greatest diural variation occurring
over the Central Plateau, where it mav be as much as 20°C! in coastal and
lake regions, it is about 8°C. Rainfall ranges from less than 500 mn in
parts of the Central Plateau to more than 2,500 mm annually in the area
northwest of Lake Malawi. About half of the country receives more than 750
mm of rain annually and the climate is characterized by alternate wet arn,;
dry seasons. In the north, from the northern coastal belt west through the
Usambara-Kilimanjaro area, there aretwo distinct wet seasons, with the main
rains in March to May and lesser rains in November to December. In the
remainder of the country, except for the area round Lake Malawi, the two
rainy seasons merge.
Population and Gross Domestic Product
2.03      The population of Tanzania, currently about 13.5 million is
increasing at an annual rate of about 2.7%. About two-thirds of the people,
occupy only 10% of the land and are concentrated in rural locations that are
geographically widely dispersed: in the coastal belt around and north of
Dar es Salaam, around Yoshi and Arusha in the north, in the areas west and
south of Lake Victoria, in the extreme west around Kigoma, and in the extreme



-3-
southwest around Mbgya.  The average population density is; only 15/km, which
compares with 19/km in Kenya and 51/km in Uganda. In recent years (1965-70),
the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been growing at about: 5.6% ner year,
except for a dip to 2.5% during 1969.  In 1971, the GDT  was about US$1,360
million at market prices. The per capita GNP (at market prices) was about
ussion.
B. The Agriculttural Sector
Contribution of Agriculture to the Fconomy
2.04       Agriculture provides 90% of employment but only about 40% of GDP
with subsistence production accounting for over half the value of the sector's
total output (Annex 1). Production, which increased over the past decade at
a rate barely sufficient to keep pace with population growth (para 2.03),
comes mostly from small farms, cultivated by hand and using family labor.
The main export products produced on small farms include c:otton, coffee,
sisal, tobacco, tea, cashew nuts, pyrethrum, meat and hides. Large-scale
agriculture is carried otut only on estates that grow coffee, sisal, tea,
and coconut, and state farms that produce wheat, rice, ancd livestock. Es-
tate production has diminished in importance, however, particularly as demand
for sisal has declined, and the state farm program remains small.
Land Use
2.05       Only about 9% of the total land area of the mainland is used for
crop cultivation--about 8% is in small farms and 17 in large holdings;
another 10% is fallow land or temporary pasture.  The remainder is in
range land or indigenous bush, with 10% and 8% set aside f or forest and
game reserves, respectively.
2.06      All land is considered to be public land and title is vested in
the Government, although approximately 80% is held by individuals or groulps
under rules of tenure in accordance with traditional or tribal rights. Lands
formerly granted as freehold have been converted by law to Government lease-
hold status and are held under long or short-term rights of occupancy, as
are other lands planned for developrment.
Ujamaa Cooperatives
2.07       At present, an estimated 15% (about 1.8 million aersons) of the
rural poptulation are living in Ujamaa villages. Ujamaa villages are eco-
nomic and social communities where neople volunteer to live and work together
for the benefit of the community as a whole.  Most of the existing Ujamaa
villages have been established in relatively poor areas with a view to
transforming them into creditworthy cooperative societies practicing com-
munal production methods.  The members of the Ujamaa village frame a con-
stitution to govern their relationships, to provide guidelines for resolving



-4-
conflicts and to define rules for sharing the benefits of their communal
efforts.  Ujamaa villages are an indigenous attempt to harness African con-
cents of communal work and nroperty to modern requirements for successful
commercial enterprises. The existing ujamaa cooneratives are almost entirely
associated with crop production and as yet there is scarcely any experience
of the Ujamaa concept applied to livestock production. The application of
these concents to livestock development in Tanzania are discussed in Annex 2.
Livestock
2.08      With about 13 million cattle and seven million sheep and goats
grazing about 155,500 square miles, livestock represents a major national
resource to Tanzania.  ?fost of the cattle population are in the traditional
sector and, although individually owned, are grazed on communal land. Since
the number rather than the quality of cattle is the traditional symbol of
wealth and marketing facilities are limited, overgrazing is widespread and
unproductive stock are not rigorously culled.
2.09      The location of the national herd is broadly determined by the
absence of tsetse flY, which precludes extensive cattle keeping in the
southeast and in large areas of the west. The greater nart of the herd is
located in M4wanza, Shinyanga, Musoma, and Singida regions where cattle are
keDt mainlv by the Sukuma people as an auxiliary activity to growing cotton
and maize.  Large concentrations are also found, however, in the Dodoma,
Arusha, and Kilimanjaro regions where animals constitute a major source of
income for the Gogo and the Masai.
2.10      Although the national herd has increased by about 2.75% per year,
from about 3 million head in 1924 to an estimated 1.3 million at present,
its productivity is extremely low.  Recorded offtake for slaughter averages
about 2.5% of the total population and amounted to 318,000 head in 1970.
Total offtake, which includes mortality, averages about 10% to 11% ner annum
and was estimated at about 1.2 million head in 1970. The low production
coefficients; a calving rate of about 50%, a calf and adult mortality of
about 20% and 10% respectively, an average liveweight at slaughter of about
250 kg, and an average steer age at slaughter of about six years, can De
attributed to inadequate nutrition, high disease and parasite infestation,
poor management, and the poor genetic quality of the native cattle (small
East African short-horn Zebu).
2.11      Even though reconnaissance information is not available to
establish precisely the potential for livestock development using modern
technology, the scope is enormous since a considerable proportion of the
area infested with tsetse could carry livestock if tsetse was controlled.
There are also areas where stocking rates could be increased substantially
if water facilities were provided.

Animal lIealth
2.12      Rinderpest and Contagious Bovine Plueropneumonia (CBPP) have
been successfullv controlled by a Government vaccination program involving
about 1 million cattle per year, and the last recorded cases occurred in
1964 and 1965, respectively. Tick-borne diseases, particularly East Coast
Fever, cause serious losses in the traditional livestock sector when there
is no routine dinning, but Government is taking steps to reduce them by
constructing and onerating diDs free of charge for the traditional producer.
To date, about 1,000 are in operation. Routine dipping is practiced on all
NACO ranches.
2.13      Foot and Mouth Disease (FlIT)) is endemic in the main area of the
traditional livestock sector.  Four of the seven Fnl tynes--Type 0, Type A,
SAT 1, and SAT2--occur but Type 0 is the most prevalent. Government operates
a strict control program that requires vaccination and quarantine of cattle
before they can be transferred to new regions and strict qusarantine of in-
fected herds. Presence of the disease, however, precludes the export of
un2Soceis,ed meat products to many markets, particularlv in Europe, and,
although Tanzania is anxious to control it, a program has not been justified
on economic grounds at this stage.
2.14      Tsetse fly, the vector responsible for trypanosomiasis of cattle
and sleeping sickness in humans, infects more than 60% of Tanzania, but
beef production is possible when effective control measures are applied.
On large blocks, (over 80,000 ha) the Tsetse Control Unit in the Ministry
of Agriculture establishes a tsetse harrier (1 to 2 km wide) by clearing
scrub around an infested area, after which insecticide is applied six times
from the air; this is subsequently maintained tsetse-free by ground spraying
a residual insecticide over any accidentallv reinfested isolated pockets.
This standard technique Is only economically feasible on large areas; on
smaller areas when the tsetse threat is moderate to low, the use of pro-
phylactic drugs is cheaner.
C. M.arketing and Slaughterhouses
2.15      The marketing system for livestock is poorly developed (Annex 3).
District development councils 1/ operate about 120 permanent primary markets
and the Ministry of Agriculture about five secondary types, but virtually
none has proper facilities or organization.  Each animal is usually handled
by one or more "bush traders" before it is finally sold irn the market. Mar-
ket charges vary from district to district and range from Tsh 7 to Tsh 22
1/   Elected municpal bodies.



- 6 -
per head. Until 1969, the dominant buyers were private traders who sold to
Tanganyika Heat Packcers (TPL) and district council buyers who supplied local
town butchers.  Government attempted to reorganiTe marketing in 1969 by
restricting private traders and authorizing the councils to purchase cattle
for TPL, but the effort was unsuccessful, and TPL is, at present, employing
its own buyers.
2.16      The absence of essential facilities such as watering and stock
handling facilities and suitable grazing/resting areas on existing holding
grounds and the total absence of stock routes and holding grounds in many
areas results in tremendous losses in cattle as they move the long distances
from production areas to the main slaughtering center at Dar es Salaam and
elsewhere. Since animals have to be vaccinated and quarantined at least
14 days before being moved between zones and, invariably, adequate water and
grazing are not provided, such losses are estimated at up to 20% of initial
body liveweight.
2.17      Tanzania has only one meat processing plant--the TPL nlant at
Dar es Salaam--and it is badly located to serve the needs of the livestock
induistrv (Annex 4), being several hundred miles from the railhead or
loading point serving the main producer areas such as Shinyanga (638 miles)
and Mheva (589 miles). The transnort charge by rail is Tsh 43 per 1head
from Shinyanga and Tsh 75 per head by truck from 'fbeva.  Erected in 1950,
the TPI, plant has a total slaughtering canacity of 3nQ,000 head of cattle
ner year and a total canning capacity of 200,00n head per year. It is 4ointly
owned by Liebigs, an international meat packing companv, and the Tanzania
Government, through its parastatal National Agricuilture and Food Company
(NAFCO) (52% ownershin) and it exports           to th  'K but also to other
European markets.  The plant oneratet't about   % of canacitv due to its
inability to procure enough cattle.  Although it might he expected that TPL
would process a large number of cull cows, the amount actuallv hana ed is
quite small due tn TPL's reluctance to offer a good pric4C  for this cate-ory
since mortality is hioh because of the long transnort distance involvec.
(Annex 4).
D. Government Services
2.18      The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives is resoonsible for
livestock production and marketing and carries out its work through its
veterinarv and animal husbandrv research, training, and extension staff and
through the parastatal corporations NAFCO and NACO. The animal industry
subdivision is responsible for disease control, livestock research centers,
tsetse control, stock; routes, holding grounds, quarantine stations, arti-
ficial insemination, meat inspection, and grading. About 34% of the 3,400-
member extension staff is working in the livestock sector.



- 7 -
2.19      Education and training facilities have been expanded recently.
Tanzanians are obtaininr degrees in agriculture at the ITniversitv of Dar es
Salaam and at Kampala, Uganda, and in veterinary science at Kahete, Kenya.
The Training Institute at Entebbe, Uganda, conducts a two-vear course for
veterinarv assistants, with outstanding students permitted to stay for a
third year for a dinloma in animal husbandrv. In addition, some 800
Tanzanians are studying for certificates and dinlomas in agriculture and
veterinary science at training institutes in Tanzania. A course leading to
a diploma in ranch management from the Ministry's training institute at Mpwapwa
is being organized and a course in practical ranch management training, under
the first livestock prolect, has been started.
2.20      Although the quality of veterinarv services, including research
is satisfactory, the extension services and research in animal production
technology are extremelv weak.  Greater emphasis is needed on animal produc-
tion factors, such as aniral husbandry and nutrition, forage production,
stocking rates, and water utilization, and research should concentrate on
accumulating data for the main innuts and techniques used in livestock pro-
duction and ranching. The Ministry of Agriculture is at present considering
reorganizing the animal industry subdivision by establishing separate produc-
tion and veterinary sections, so that production aspects of livestock devel-
opment can be given more attention.
E. Agricultural Institutions and Credit
2.21      Tanzanian credit institutions are wholly Government-owned
(Annex 5), with the Tanzanian Rural Development Bank (TRDB) responsible
for agricultural credit. It was created in 1971 and took over agreed assets
and liabilities, as well as the operations of the former National Develo-ment
Credit Agency. Most of TRDB's current lending involves three IDA credits
(para 1.03), and, since it is TRDB's policy to lend at rates that reflect
the commercial cost of capital, long and short-term loans are generally made
at 8-1/2%.  TRDB has its head office in Dar es Salaam and operates 12 regional
offices but there are plans for six more to obtain countrywide coverage.
Technical assistance is given to borrowers bv regional representatives trained
in agriculture and economics, and technical services are being strengthened
by the addition of six IJNDP/FAO snecialists.
2.22      The National Bank of Commerce was established in 1967 to take over
the business of nine nationalized banks. Lending operations extend into
agriculture, industrv and commerce with loans granted to both the private
and public sectors. Most of its lending is on a short-term basis and its
agricultural loans are mainly to cooperatives and Darastata'L companies for
production, marketing and processing with interest rate at about 8-1/2% per
annum (Annex 5).



- 8 -
2.23      The National Agricultural and Food Corporation (NAFCO) was estab-
lished in 1969 to promote agricultural development and the production of
food.  It operates through several subsidiaries which enjoy substantial au-
tonomy. Its investments include TPL (jointly with Liebigs - para 2.17) and
the National Agricultural Company (NACO), incorporated in 1968 with an
authorized share capital of Tsh. 50 million fully subscribed and owned by
NAFCO.
2.24      NACO is implementing the first livestock project: it operates a
total of 12 ranch-farm enternrises including one sheen and one pig unit.
The general policy directed from head office is implemented by ranch managers;
four technical ranch officers recently recruited from Australia will further
strengthen NACO's management. Over the Dast few years NACO's ranching oper-
ations have satisfactorily undergone a transition neriod with a rapid build-
up in total stock. The build-up in breeding cows has been particularly
significant and after 1972, feeder cattle will no longer have to be purchased
for these ranches.
F. First Livestock Development Project
2.25      The first IDA credit for livestock was made in 1968 for US$1.3
million to cover 65% of a beef ranching development with a total cost of
US$2 million. The project aims to increase the output of beef, expand the
production of improved breeding stock and demonstrate the advantages of
modern ranching techniques by developing five cattle ranches and providing
technical services and a training program for ranch management.  Panch devel-
opment is now satisfactory and early difficulties have been overcome. Poor
management on two ranches was rectified by replacing managers with experienced
staff. Severe drought conditions resulted in high cattle mortality on one
ranch and cattle rustling led to unexpected transfers of stock from one ranch
to another. A problem outside NACO's control was the low fixed meat prices
prevailing in Tanzania. Prices though still controlled were substantially
increased in 1972.  Disbursements of IDA funds to mid-December 1972 were
slightly behind schedule with a total of USM1.14 million or 88% of total credit
but the project is expected to be fully disbursed by the closing date (December
1973). Generally, this project has demonstrated the feasibility of establishing
an efficient beef industrv in Tanzania.
ITT. ThE PPOJECT
A. General Description
3.01      The pronosed Second Livestock Development Project would be a
broadLy based, intef'rated program over five years aimed at increasing beef



- 9 -
production in Tanzania through ranch development, meat nrocessing and bv
imnroving essential infrastructures. The Project would include:
(a)  develonment of 11 NACO ranches, four DDC ranches, and
22 ujmaa coonerative ranches:
(b) developrent of three large markets, 10 medium-size markets,
and 20 small markets and the remodelling of 104 srmall
existing markets;
(c) development of 2,300 km of new stock routes and 2,200 km of
existing stock routes and establishrent of four new holding
grounds and improvement of 23 existing ones;
(d)  reconstruction of one meat processing plant (TPL) and the
construction of two new ones; and
(e)  provision of technical services, training and project
preparation.
3.02      A Project Management Unit would be set up in the Ministry of
Agriculture to coordinate and supervise ProJect operations; TRDB would be
the main credit channel and two new companies would be established to handle
livestock marketing and meat processing.
B. Detailed Features
Ranch Develonment
3.03      NACO Ranches  -  The Project wouild finance further development of
three NACO ranches already established at UsanRu, Sumbawanga, the Kitulo
Plateau, establishment of four new NACO ranches at Dakawa, Mkata, Malagarasi,
and Missenyi East, and four nexw ranches at M-iisa. The ranch on the Kitulo
Plateau, developed with LTNDP assistance, is nresently owmed by Government,
but is to be transferred to NACO, with existing stock and machinery.  It
would be a condition of credit effectiveness that this transfer had taken
place.
3.04      Ranches would average about 34,000 ha and all would be based on
native tropical grasses, except I'itulo (9,200 ha), which would have improved
ryegrass and white clover pastures. Breeding and fattening operations would
be carried out at IJsangu, Sumbawanpa, Missenyi East, Kitulo, and. the four
ranches at Nwisa, wqhile Dukawa would produce feeders for the fattening ranch
at ikata. The ranch at Malagarasi would finish locally produced steers for
export to Zaire.



- 10 -
3.05      The main investment items would include firebreaks, farm roads,
water development, stock dipping and handling facilities, and workmen's
housing, pasture develonment (Kitulo only), breeding, stock, steers and oper-
atinp expenses for the first two years.  Development on each ranch would he
spread over two vears excent at Kitulo, (five years). Investment ner ranch
would range frorm Tsh. 1.8 million to about Tsh. 7.2 million. Tsetse clearance
in the Mwisa area would be accomplished by, the Ministry's Tsetse control unit
with assistance from ITSAID.  Fanch projections for the eleven ranches anpear
in Annex 6, Tables 1 to 28.
3.06      DDC Ranches -  In order to encourage decentralized regional devel-
opment, the Government is establishing District Developrent Corporations
(DDCs) in part to own and operate breeding/fattening ranches. The Project
would finance four, and these are exnected to be in Morogoro, Mbeya, Iringa
and Inzega Districts. All would be about 40,o0o ha in size and investment
per ranch would be about Tsh. 4.6 million. The development model for these
ranches is based on the proposed NACO Missenyi East ranch (Annex 6, Tables
1 to 4) with similar inputs. Development on each ranch would be over two
years.
3.07      IJjamaa Cooperative Ranches - The Project would develop 22 Ujamaa
cooperative ranches covering about 100,000 ha. Ranches in the Shinyanga
Region comprising a total of about 50,000 ha would be develoned with about
200 Sukuma families on sparsely populated under-utilized grazing land.
Livestock owners presently grazing the area would become members of the
Ujamaa and contribtute about eight head of stock each.  Similar type ranches
on about 20,000 ha are expected to be developed in the Dodoma region. Members
would be livestock owners from a Gogo and a Nguu village already grazing their
cattle in the area. It is expected that eight disrersed Masai Ujamaa coopera-
tive ranches would be develoDed in Arusha District through ranching associa-
tions formed under the Range Development and Management Act. Eacn ranch would
be about 4,000 ha in size and would produce improved Boran bulls for sale to
the ranch association members who are also Ujamaa members and graze about
20,000 cattle on a surrounding area of about 150,000 ha. Ranches would be
run on commercial lines, with pair management and labor, and would demonstrate
the valtue of good ranch management techninues. Profits would be used for
development on each association's ranch area. The ranch developments financed
would include water develonment, firebreaks, stock dipping and handling facil-
ities, housing, and incremental working capital.  These are aimed ddirectly at
the traditional livestock producer and careful attention was given to physical,
technical, sociological, economic, orgaiization and cultural implications of
the Ujamaa. Development on each ranch would be over two years. Projections
for the Ujamaa (Annex 6, Tables 29 to 32) and Masai Ujamaa (Annex 6, Tables
33 to 36) ranches are presented to provide broad development guidelines.
Markets, Stock Routes, and Holding Grotunds
3.08      Markets.  The Project would develop three larc-e cattle markets
(capacity 1,000 head), 10 medium markets (capacity 500 head), and 20 small



- 11 -
markets (capacity 50 to 200 head) and assist in repairing 104 small existing
markets (Annex 3, Tables 1 to 3).  A livestock marketin- company would be
formed to carry out develonments and operate related facilities, (hereafter
referred to as the Tanzania Livestock 1-arketing Company (TLMC) (para 4.07).
Sales would be held weekly in the large and medium-size facilities and monthly
in the small ones. Markets wiould be develoned in association with stock routes
and holding grounds and serve the four major cattle zones--in the north around
Arusha, in the west around Shinyanga and West Lake, in the central zone around
Dodoma, and in the southern zone around ?lbeva.  Basic inputs would be yards,
pens, simple livestock handling facilities, auction rings, office buildings,
stores, water facilities, and livestock weighing scales.  The market develop-
ment program would be phased over a four-year period.
3.09      Stock Routes and Holding Grounds.  The Project would develop 2,300
km of new stock routes (Annex 3, Table 4) and improve 2,20CI km of existing
ones (Annex 3, Table 5). On the new stock routes, the Project would develop
water points at intervals of abont 25 km, clear about 2,300 km of cattle
tracks, and provide six veterinary checknoints with stock clipping and handling
facilities. On existing stock routes, the Project would clear 2,200 km of
cattle tracks and provide 100 fenced night pens. The Project would also
establish four new holding grounds and upgrade 23 existing ones. Basic in-
piuts for the holding grounds would be firebreaks, tracks, water facilities,
stock handling facilities, vehicles, and enuinment (Annex 3, Tables 6 and 7).
Development of stock routes and holding grounds would be over four years.
Meat Processing
3.10      The Project would finance construction of two meat processing
plants, one at Mbeya in the southwestern zone (580 miles from Dar es Salaam),
and one at Shingyanga in the western zone (640 miles from D)ar es Salaam),
each with capacity to handle 200 cattle per day. Although the TPL plant at
Dar es Salaam is operating below capacity, the new plants will increase off-
take in the main cattle producing areas and will be complementary to the TPL
plant bv providing boned out meat for canning. They are further justified
by increases in cattle offtake which under the Project alone is expected to
reach about 130,000 annually after 12 years (paras 5.01 and 5.02).
3.11      The Project would also support major reconstruction and remodeling
of the TPL. plant, built in 1950 at Dar es Salaam, so that it could continue
to meet veterinary and sanitary standards renuired for exporting canned corn
beef to the TK, its main outlet.  Investment in the TPL plant would be about
Tsh 11.6 million and would be spread over the first three years of the
Project; investment in the new plant at Mbeya and Shinvanga would be spread
over two years and would begin in the Project's first vear. A meat process-
ing company to undertake this development (hereafter referred to as the
Tanzania Meat Processing Company (TiTC) would be established as a subsidiary
of NAFCO (para 4.09). Development details are given in Annex 4.



- 12 -
ODerating Expenses
3.12      The Project would finance certain initial operatinp expenses for
ranch develonment and the new meat processing plants. The amounts and the
itemsq financed are shown in the model investment projections.  For ranch
models fixed and variable net operating costs (sales revenues less costs)
are financed for the first two years of development when sales are insuf-
ficient to meet operating costs. Incremental working capital is provided
for the M4bevp and Shinyanga meat processing plants (Annex 4, Tables 3 and 5),
amounting to about Tsh. 1.9 million.
Technical Services
3.13      The Project would include the following technical services, staffing
and training for Project implementation monitoring and evaluation:
(a)  a Project Management Unit, staffed with an experienced
project manager, an assistant project manager, and a
range management/water specialist (para 4.01):
(b)  a Credit Specialist for TRDB (para 4.03);
(c)  the continued services of the Chief Ranch Development
Officer and four ranch technical officers and financing
for an additional senior ranch development offlcer for
NACO (para 4.04 and Annex 7);
(d)  an accountant for the proposed Tanzania Livestock Marketing
Companv (paras 4.07 and 4.11);
(e)  a meat technologist for the proposed Tanzania Meat
Processing Company (para 4.09):
(f)  Project related applied investigational work which would
be initiated by the Project Manaaement ITnit;
(g)  overseas training (four 2-year fellovshins) for technical
staff; local training for technical staff (five 3-year
fellowships), and clerical staff (Annex 8);
(h)  the preparation of future projects in the livestock sector
(Annex 8) and retroactively financing of foreign exchange
costs already incurred in preparing the Project (US$50,000).
It is expected that all specialists except the Project Manager would be
expatriates.

3.18      The proposed IDA Credit of ITS$13.5 million, representing the for-
eign exchange comnonent and about half local costs wTould be to G.overnment
on standard terms and would be channelled as follows:
(a)  Funds for ranch development, livestock marketing and
meat processing through TRDR to final beneficiaries.
Government would make its contribution (28%) through
NAYCO as its holding company for parastatal ranching
(NACO), neat processing (ThPC) and cattle marketing
(TWfC) and through DDCs for ranches sponsored by them.
Ujamaa members would make their contribution to devel-
opment costs by providing cattle and labor. Since the
MTasai own large numbers of cattle, their contribution
is set at 20%, but other UIjamaa members would contribute
10%, the anount judged to be realistic having regard to
their resources.
(b) Funds for project related research, training, equipment
for the Tsetse Control Unit and nroject prenaration would
remain with Government and wotuld be handled through the
Ministry of Agriculture.

3.19      IDA funds would be made available to TRDB at 4% annually (para 4.02)
for 20 years including 5 years of grace in which interest only would be paid.
TRDB would on-lend to final beneficiaries at 8-1/2% annuallv (its current
lending rate) for periods of un to 12 years including a six year grace neriod
for ranches and a three year grace Dertod for TT.'¶C and T,PC. The security
for ranch develonment loans would be a lien on land and chattel mortgage on
cattle.  A lien on assets financed would be reqiired as security for loans
to TLMC and PTCG. It would be a condition of credit effectiveness that a
subsidiarv loan agreement between Government and TRDB reflecting the above
lending terms and acceptable to IDA had been executed.
E.  Procurerment
3.20      Procurement under the Project would be as follows:
(a)  The two nroposed meat processing plants at Shinyanga and
Mbeya (estimated cost IUS84.1 million) Twould be constructed
under turn-key contracts in order to ensure compatibility
and integration of several tvnes of equinment supplied by
various manufacturers and selection would be after inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guide-
lines.  Machinerv and eruinment required for the remodeling
of the TPL plant (US$ 0.6million), the Tsetse Control Unit
and for ranches (US$3 million) and miscellaneous items
(fertilizers, medicines, small equipment) where an individual
contract would exceed US$30,000 would also be procured
through international competitive bidding in accordance with
IDA guidelines. Local manufacturers would be allowqed a
preferential margin of 15% or the existing rate of imnort
duties (whichever is the lover) in accordance with IDA
guidelines.
(b)  Ranch, markotinp and other infrastructure development would
be carried out by Government either bv force account or
local contract: international biddirg would not he appro-
priate due to the scattered onerations and the need to
synchronize various asnects of develonment.
(c)  All l.ivestock required for the Project would be purchased
locallv:  local livestock su-ply is adequate. 1/

Assurances on the above procureTnent arrangements were agreed at negotiations.
It was also agreed that draft hiddino docutrents for international procurement
items would be submitted for prior IDA a.proval.
F. Disbursement
3.21      Disbursement from the credit would be made for:
(a)  The CTP cost (USS1.5 million) of heavv eqltinmnent and
machinerv for the Government Tsetse Control Tinit, and
of other vehicles and equit,ment:
(b)  100 percent of TRDB loans for ranch development,
livestock marketing and meat processing (loans would
be about 70% of total expenditures for each component);
(c)  100% of foreir.n eDnendiiture and 70% of local expenditure
(for technical staff);
(d)  10n% of foreign and 70% of local. expenditure for inter-
national training: eoiiinyient and materials for technical
work.

would comprise a number of components, botlh geographically and organiza-
tionally dispersed, an executive committee under the chairmanshlip of the
Project Manager would be formed to ensure coordination. Its other members
would be the senior executive officers of the major organizations involved.
TP.DB
4.02      TRDB would be the channel for IDA financed loans for NACO (para
4.04), DDC's and Ujamaa ranches, and for TLMC (para 4.07) and TMPC (para
4.09). TRDB is the channel for other IDA credits and while the operating
policies are satisfactory, accounts recently received indicate a sharp rise
in overdues - from Tsh 15.5 million as of May 1971 to Tsh 75.3 million as of
Sentember 1972. TRDB's loan portfolio increased by 63% during this period
and although overdues have remained constant (217 of total) the provision
for bad debts increased by 11% onlv, from Tsh 11.4 million to Tsh 12.7 mil-
lion.  Accordingly, it would be a condition of credit effectiveness that an
analysis of such overdues and a statement of measures which TRDB would take
to reduce them to accentable levels would first have been received by TDA.
In order to facilitate the strenpthenin- of TRDB's financial nosition ana to
enable it to build up reserves, IDA funds would be made available to it at D
4% annually, (para 3.19) the rate applying under the first livestock project J
and would be on-lent to final beneficiaries at 8-1/27 annually (its current
lending rate) giving TRDB a margin of 4-1/2% annually.
4.03      TRDB would be advised bv the Project Management UInit in evaluating
all investment plans as to their technical, financial and economic suitability.
TPDB which would be strengthened bv the appointment of an additional credit
specialist would anprove or reject loan proposals on the basis of its own
evaluation. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the following
conditions Tould be met before a ranch develonment loan was made under the
Project:
(a)  provisional rights of user covering the whole area for
that ranch had been established by Government:
(h)  each Ujamaa vill.age ranch was registered as a cooperative
society under the Coonerative Societies Act, 1968; and
(c)  a certificate of occupancv had been obtained for each
Ujamaa, guiaranteeinc to the UTjamaa village the exclusive
use of the land allocated to it, for a period of at least
50 years.

NACO
4.01,     NACO iqoild bp res'onnsible for developing' its ranches tinder the
2llidance of its ranch officers, along lines similar to those under the first
project. NACO has good experience of ranch develonment and its technical
and management performance has been greatly improved under the first nroject.
1. senior ranch development ofFicer would be located in the West Lake region
to direct develon-enit of the four neu ranches at Mtiisa and direct the fur-
ther dcvelonnent of the tlhree existing ranches in that area.  The Financial
aso,ects of NACO's development will however need careful monitoring; accumu-
Slatedl losses incurred over the last five years anotnting to Tsih 5.3 million
are showm in YACO's balance sheet for 1971.  During this period rapid devel-
opment took place with a large build-un in breeding stock numbers without a
corresDonding build-un in sales wihich normally lag three to four years after
the retention of breeding stock until incremental offtake is generated. At
appraisil it was estimated that 'WACO's cattle stocks were under valued in
the balance sheet b7 about Tsh 5.5 million (Annex 7).
t4. 05    NACO's operatinns will be substantially expanded as a result of the
oroject and its financial position strengthened enabling it to operate on a
commercial basis.  Tn addition, the new investment will improve NACO's liquiid-
ltv during the initial Project years (Annex 7, Table 4).  At negotiations
assurances were obtained that NACO would submit its develonment program to
DA for review and corment at least three months before the beginninp of its
'inancial year and that the program submitteA would nroVide detailed ohysical
and financial projections.
DDC and other ITlamaa Coonerative Ranches
4.06      While the main resnonsibilitv for irnlementing developments on DDC
.ind Ujamaa ranches would rest with DDC's and Ujamaa committees, TRDB and the
Ministrv of Agriculture would provide overall guidance and technical assist-
ance.  The Project Management Unit would advise and assist the technical sta-f
of TRDB and the Mlinistry of Agriculture in detailed ranch planning. Assur-
inces were obtained that Government and TRDB would provide the requ-.t.
number of technical staff for detailed ranch planning and that both would
continue to supply the required staff for continued extension services and
supervision.
Livestock Marketing
4.07           Marketed offtake from the cattle population is low in Tanzania
averaging about 2.6% during 1959-70.  During 1971, the total number marketed
was estimated at 338,000 ouit of a nopulation of 13 million cattle.  Poor
organization and operation of the livestock marketing system is a major
factor contributing to this low offtake. Accordingly a livestock marketing
company (TLMC) would be established as a subsidiary of NAFCO but with a large
measure of autonomv (Annex 3). It would:



- 21 -
(a)  have responsibility for carrying out developments onT
markets, stock routes, and holding grounds under the
Project and for oDerating, maintaining and supervising         l
these facilities;
(b)  organize 13 marketing teams, each of which would condtuct
four secondary 1/ and 12 primary markets 2/ per month; and
(c)  become a major cattle buyer ourchasing cattle from TMPC,
NACO, flDC's and Ujamaa cooperatives on a contract basis.
It is probable that by 19R8 TLMC would nurchase over 50%
of cattle entering the marketing svstem. A total of 13
buving teams would be est.iblished over a two-year period
(Annex 3).
4.08      The establishment of a livestock marketing company would be a
condition of credit effectiveness and assurances were obtained that all
stock routes and holding grounds and markets currentlv operated by the
Ministry of Agriculture would be transferred to the company. The Government
veterinary service would, however, continue to have responsibility for dis-
ease control and certification in the marketing and moveTnent of livestock.
Furthermore, in order to assure that livestock marketing in Tanzania could
function efficiently an assurance was obtained that a grading and pricing
structure relating liveweight to carcass value and providing adequate in-
centives to producers would be established in consultation with IDA within
six months of credit effectiveness. Since it is olanned that the TLMC would
be commercially viable, an assurance was obtained that it would charge fecs
which would allow a reasonable profit after allowing for operating and other
costs. The charges and fees used in the projection for the Livestock
iMarketing Company (Annex 3, Tables 3, 8) are included as guidelines.
Meat Processing
4.09      A meat processing company (TMTC) would be established as a sub-
sidiary of NAFCO to own and operate the meat packing plants at Shinyanga
and l4beva.  This comoany would also take over the Government shareholding
in the TPL plant at Dar es Salaam, which oroduces canned corn beef and
meat extracts for export to the ITK by Liebigs under their well-established
Fray Bentos branch (para 2.17).  A management contract for the operation
of the Shinyanga and Mbeya plants would be drawm up between the Tanzania
Meat Processing Company and an exnerienced international meat processing
company, the terms and conditions of the contract and the suitability and
experience of the processing connany to be subject to IDIA approval. Assur-
ances were obtained to this effect and also that the location, design and
1/   Secondary Market - capacity 500 to 1,000 animals
2/   Primary Market - capacity 50 to 100 animals



- 22 -
specifications for the meat plants including equipment would be approved by
IDA. It would be a condition of credit effectiveness that TVPC had been
established.
Accounts and Audit
4.10      NACO has a satisfactory svstem of accounts and internal control
and, with minor increases in staffing, it could undertake the expanded ac-
tivities envisaged under the Project. Delays have occurred in presentin,
audited accounts and the auditors' report for 1970 and 1971 to IDA because
an insufficient number of qualified accountants were available in the
Tanzania Audit Corporation. The Government is proposing to make arrange-
ments to overcome this problem hy an association between the corporation
and private firms. It was agreed at negotiations that as a condition of credit
disbursement to NACO, audited balance sheet and accounts for FY 1972 should be
forwarded to IDA by NACO.
4.11      TLMC would be required to adopt an accounting system that woulId
show, in accordance with sound, consistently applied nrinciples, the applica-
tion of credit funds and the revenues and exnenditures of the various com-
nonents of the Project so that the financial results of the operation could
be fairlv assessed. Assurances were obtained that such a system would be
set un under an experienced accountant who would establish financial pro-
cedures and introduce adenuate accounting and control methods.
4.12      The present system of accounts and internal control at TPT. is
satisfactory and sim,ilar arrangements would be instituted by TMPC for the
proposed Mbeya and Shinyanga plants.  Each DDC and Ujamaa cooperative ranch
would also be required to keep a set of ranch accounts for submission to
TRDB at quarterly intervals.  Assurances were obtained during negotiations
from TRDB that it would ensure that this was done.
4.13      Assurances were obtained that TRDB, NACO, TIMC and TMPC would
have their accounts audited by independent auditors acceptable to IPJ ancr.
that accounts and auditors' reports would be furnished to the Association
not later than six months after the end of their respective financial years.
V. PRODUCTION, -ARKET PPOSPECTS MID PRICES,
AND PRODIJCER BENEFITS
Production
5.01      At full development (year 12), it is estimated that Project ranches
would produce annually about 45,000 cattle for slaughter, equivalent to about,
10,OnO tons of additional beef, which represents a 22% increase over the
cturrent marketed production, and about 13,000 breeding heifers and 1,300
breeding bulls.  The estimated output of the ranches is surnarized below:

5.02      In addition the marketing component of the Project is expected to
substantially increase marketed offtake from the traditional herd.  Tf the
Project were undertaken without this component, offtake would likely in-
crease by about 100,000 aninals, to about 438,000 animals; by full Project
development.  With the marketing component, however, the offtake would be
565,000 annually at full development renresenting an increment of 127,000
animals.  After deducting the contribuition of Project ranches (about 45,000
head) to marketed offtake, the marketing component alone is expected to
increase offtake by about 85,000 head and beef production by about 11,000
tons (24%) and the Project is, therefore, expected to increase total beef
production by about 21,000 tons annually at full developrnent (46%).
5.03      The financial rate of return for the investment in TLMC is estim-
ated at about 18%.  Financial projection indicate that based on anticipated
fees and charges the marketing companv would be financiaLly viable with
positive net income from year 1 (Annex 3, Table 10).  Tq'C would provide an
additional outlet for producers bv opening processing plants in cattle
areas and the physical presence of the plants would have a significant im-
pact on local cattle offtake.  The financial rate of return for TMPC is
estimated at 20% and for individual plants, it ranges from 19 to 26%.
Financial projections indicate that on assumed meat Drices (para 5.05) the
company would be financially viable with positive net income from year 4
(Annex 4, Table 9).

Market Prosnects and Prices
5.04      The retail price for beef is controlted in Tanzania by price con-
trol ordinances issued for each city. Price control was introduced in 1967
when the retail price of beef was fixed at Tsh 2.55 per kg carcass weight
and was maintained at that level for the succeeding five years.  Low beef
prices led to a rapid increase in demand for beef in Dar es Salaam - from
37,000 cattle in 1967 to an estimated 100,000 in 1972 representing a demand
increase of about 36% p.a. over this period, compared to 12% p.a. over the
preceding five years (1963-67). The controlled retail prices also kept
producer prices low, which reduced the supply of cattle to TPL. Cattle
supplies to TPL grew at about 8% per annum; and TPL was only allowed to
export surpluses over demand in Dar es Salaam. The slowly increasing supply
and the rapidlv increasing demand led to substantial reduction in export
volume (from 97,000 head in 1966 to 36,000 head in 1971).
5.05      Recentlv, Government has announced an increase in the retail price
of beef by 33 to 5n% denending on grade, and this is estimated to increase
producer prices by 40% over those obtaining in recent years. These higher
prices have been used in the analysis in the report (an average producer
price of about Tsh 1.65 per kg liveweight). TPL exports canned corned beef
mainly to the UK and market prospects are good. The total corned beef cap-
acity of Tanzania (200,000 head) represents about 14% of the total imports
of canned beef into the UK. In 1972, Tanzania supplied less than 3 percent
of 1XK imports, and it should be able to sell its additional corned beef on
the UK market. The balance of production would be sold in the domestic
market. At negotiations an assurance was obtained that Government would
consult regularly witlh TTA on its pricing policies in respect of the produc-
tion, processing and marketing of beef cattle and that the objective of such
policies shall include (i) the encouragement of nroduction and export of beef
products; (ii) the financial viability of the Beneficiaries; and (iii) a
reasonable allocation of investment resources in beef cattle and other saez<r._
Producer Benefits
5.06      The financial rates of return for the individual ranch models vary
from 14 to 26%.  The main incentives for the Ujamaa participants, would be
primarily the increase in the number of cattle owned and secondly improved
income levels. Further, the rationalization of livestock marketing and the
development of processing plants in high cattle density areas are expected
to have direct and indirect benefits for livestock producers.
Government Costs and Revenue
5.07      The Government would finance US$5.9 million (about 25%) of the total
Project cost. At full development the Project would generate about US$1.9
million tax revenue annually and in addition, the parastatal companies would
generate US$2.7 million net income anntally.  Although it is difficult to



- 25 -
quantify the incremental operating costs that would be incurred by Govern-
ment, the total is not expected to be large since parastatals provide oper-
ating costs from revenue and the main additional costs wotlId be to provide
field extension services to Ujamaa cooperatives; estimated at about US$50,000
annually.
VI.  BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Value of Additional Output
6.01      At full development (year 12), Project incremental beef production
would be about 21,000 tons, of which half is attributed to the ranches and
half to the rationalization of the cattle marketing systern and the location
of meat processing plants in Shinyanga and Mbeya. The higher production
levels would supplement net foreign exchange earnings from increased exports
of canned corned beef building up to the equivalent of 60,000 head annually
and amounting to a value of US$6 million annually at full development.
6.02      The overall economic return is estimated at about 35%:  estimates of
economic return on individual components would require arbitrary allocation
of the investment in marketing to ranching and processing and would not
therefore be meaningful.  In estimating the economic rate of return, the
following major adjustments were made from the financial data:
(a)  price contingencies were excluded from costs;
(b)  unskilled labor was shadow priced at Tsh 77 per man
month (market wage rate is Tsh 12n/man month) in view
of the substantial under-employment in the range areas;
this represents anproximately the value of subsistence
production;
(c)  foreign exchange costs and benefits were shadow priced
at Tsh 10 per USS to reflect more adequately the scarcity
value of foreign exchange; the official exchange rate is
Tsh 7.14 per US$;
(d)  to value project production, border prices adjusted
for transport cost were used.
6.03      As indicated in Annex 13, the economic rate of return is likely to
be at least 25 even under less favorable assumptions. An increase in invest-
ment costs by 10% would lower the rate of return to 32% and a decrease in
gross benefits of 10% would lower the return to 25%. If unskilled labor
were valued at its full market price, the rate of return would be about 27%
and if neither labor nor foreign exchange were shadow Driced, the rate of
return would be 14%.



- 26 -
Fmployment
6.04      The Project is expected to create an additional 2,500 jobs in the
NACO/DDC ranches, stockroutes/holding grounds, and at the meat plants. In
addition, the Project would create more productive self-employment opportuni-
ties for about 1,400 persons in 700 families on Ujamaa ranches; most of the
potential participants are currently under-employed.
-.ncome Distribution
i.0n5     Government would be a maior partner and beneficiary under the Project,
with its participation through NACO, DDCs, TUIC and T!AC and most benefits
would thus accrue to Government as profits and tax revenue.  Non-government
7?articipants in the project would be the small cattle owners and employees
of the ranches, and the meat processing, and livestock marketing companies.
For Ujamaa ranchers, family incomes (5 members) would increase from a subsist-
ence level of UqS130 per annum to about US$800 per annum, or from US$26 to
JS.S160 on a per capita basis.  For wage earners the expected family income
*jould increase from a subsistance level of about USt130 per annum to 1TS8400
ier annum, or from US$26 to TJSS80 per capita. The average per capita income
in the rural sector is US$40 p.a. and therefore the Project is expected to
henefit the lower income groups.
6.06      The Project is not without risks.  While the potential for expanding
the livestock sector is great, the problems of implementation are likely to
be considerable, mainly because of the lack of managerial and technical ex-
pertise. The livestock marketing and meat processing companies would he
newly established, without much experience in their respective fields and
can be expected to experience growing pains. Although the tTjamaa basis for
ranch organization may be aDpropriate to Tanzanian social conditions, its
application to cattle ranching is new and its success depends on the supn'lV
of adeouate managerial and technical exDertise over a long period. Although
provision is made in the Project to provide such assistance this asDect w.ll?
require close monitoring.

Agriculture in the Economy
Geography and Climate
1.        Tanzania, located in East Africa between latitudes 10 and 12° South
and longitudes 29° and 400 West, has a total land area of 91 million ha.
Nearly all of the country, with the exception of a narrow coastal belt in
the west, is over 300 m above sea level and more than half is above 1,000 m.
The country can be divided broadly into five agricultural areas:
(a) the eastern coastal belt extending from Kenya in the
north to Mozambique in the south (sisal, rice, cashew
nuts, copra, and cotton);
(b) the Iringa/Mbeya regions which, together, make up the
Southern Highlands in the southwest (tea, coffee, maize,
tobacco, potatoes, pyrethrum, and livestock);
(c) the central plateau encompassing the Dodoma, Tabora, and
Kigoma regions (groundnuts, maize, palm oil, sunflower
and castor seed, tobacco, cotton, and livestock);
(d) the area adjacent to Lake Victoria, extending from Bukoba
in the west around the lower extremities of thle lake to
M4wanza and beyond on the eastern shore (coffee, bananas,
tobacco, tea, cotton, cassava, and livestock);
te) the north-central area, comprising Arusha, and Kilimanjaro
(coffee, potatoes, vegetables, sugar, sisal, wheat, barley,
coffee, pyrethrum, and livestock).
2.        Most of the country experiences a dry season from June to October
and a rainy season between November and lay.  Many areas also have a short
dry season in December. Annual precipitation varies from around 500 mm a
year in Dodoma to 2,000 mm and above in the Bukoba Regicin and parts of Mbeya
and Iringa. Temperatures vary from a typical tropical pattern in the
eastern coastal belt to a temperate one in the Southern Highlands, where
a considerable expanse of good agricultural land lies at: elevations of
2,000 to 3,000 m.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
Livestock in the Agricultural Economy
3.        Agriculture provides a livelihood for some 90% of Tanzania's 13.5
million people, the majority of whom live at subsistence levels. The total
value of agricultural production in 1971 was approximately US$466 million
which represented some 38% of GDP. Cotton, sisal, livestock, coffee, cashew
nuts, tea, groundnuts, pyrethrum, and tobacco are the most important agri-
cultural export products. Total beef offtake amounted to approximately 11%
of total agricultural production.
4.        The total value of agricultural exports in 1971 was about US$176
million, of which about US$8 million, or 4.5%, were from processed and live
beef cattle. Because of uncertain market prospects for the three most impor-
tant export crops--coffee, cotton, and sisal--diversification of production,
with emphasis on beef production, is given high priority by Government.
Conside*4rng that Tanzania has a beef herd of some 13 million head, the second
largest on the African Continent, and extensive range and grasslands and
equable climate, the possibilities for expanding beef production are good.
5.        The local cattle are a mixture of breeds, with Zebu blood predomi-
nating, but they might generally be described as being a small and unifilproved
overall type. The mature weight of cows is in the range 240 to 280 kg. In
the past, various breeds, including the Shorthorn, Holstein, Devon, Angus,
and Boran, have been used to upgrade the quality and size of the Zebu, but
the most successful cross, from a commercial point of view, appears to be
the Zebu and Boran. Steers have reached mature weight of 480 kg, according
to records kept by NACO at the Kongwa ranch. For the full potential of
these crossbred animals to be realized by the traditional farmer, however,
there would have to be a considerable increase in the general standard of
feeding, management, and disease control.
6.        The majority of the national herd is distributed throughout the
northern part of the country, with the heaviest concentrations in Nwanza.
Shinyanga, Musoma, and Singida regions and lesser concentrations in -i_
Dodoma, Arusha, and Kilimanjaro regions. This pattern is largely deter-
mined by the distribution of the tsetse fly, which limits cattle keepn?i
in the southeast and west of the country, except for the Mbeya region in
the southwest.
7.        In the Mwanza, Shinyanga, Musoma, and Singida regions, the Sukuma
people are the main cattle owners, running small herds (average, 20-30 head)
to supplement their earnings from cotton and maize, which are the principal
income earners. In the Dodoma, Arusha, and Kilimanjaro regions, the Gogo
and Masai peoples run bigger herds (average, 50 head), which tend to provide
most of the family income. The Sukuma, the Gogo, and the Masai all graze
their cattle on communal lands and since all regard their animals as capi-
tal (i.e., "wealth"), they prefer, in general, to increase their herd size
rather than sell animals. This attitude has been an important factor con-
tributing to the expansion of the national herd from around 3 million head
iT. 1921 to an estimated 13 million in 1971.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
8.        The latter increase in cattle numbers, without an accompanying
improvement in feed supply and management, has resulted in overstocking in
several areas to a dangerous level, which can neither be increased nor even
tolerated indefinitely. Furthermore, increasing pressure on the better land
for cash cropping is tending not only to reduce the total area available for
grazing but to force cattle back to the poorer and less productive areas.
9.        In all areas in which cattle are presently found, considerable
scope exists for improved production. There is, however, a need for better
watering facilities, firebreaks, and additional stock routes, and such fa-
cilities should be provided on a first priority basis. More efficient util-
ization of existing dips is also necessary since less than 1 million (i.e.,
less than 8%) of the national herd are now treated regularLy, although exist-
ing facilities could accommodate about one-half of the total number. There
is insufficient knowledge of nutrition and management on the part of the
majority of traditional producers, so that there is an urgent need for train-
ing throughout the entire country. Again, in the Southern Highlands, there
are hundreds of thousands of acres of good land that are free of tsetse and
that could be developed into high-producing temperate grasslands, based on
perennial ryegrass/white clover mixtures, where beef or milk, or a combina-
tion of both, could be produced economically. The Kitulo and Lukinga areas
are examples of this class of land and considerable investigational work has
already been done on the former under UNDP/FAO auspices to demonstrate its
potential.
10.       As might be expected, the offtake of cattle from the traditional
sector is low, being estimated at 10 to 11% per annum. This figure is based
on export numbers of hides and skins, which includes hides from animals that
were dying from disease and other causes, along with those killed for sub-
sistence needs. In 1970, only 318,000 cattle, or 27% of total estimated
offtake, passed through organized market channels. There is wide scope for
increasing offtake to almost double the present figure and for increasing
both slaughter weights and carcass quality. Such increases can result from
improved animal management and a more rational use of existing resources and
from the application of newer techniques and modest physical inputs. These
moves, however, need to be coordinated to ensure that transport, market,
and slaughter facilities keep step since existing facilities are not always
adequate to service even the present numbers.
11.       There are good reasons why Tanzania should be encouraged to expand
beef production. Rising internal consumption along with expanding markets
for live cattle in bordering countries such as Uganda, Kenya, and Zambia,
together with good prospects for canned meat on the international market,
make future prospects for the cattle industry extremely good.
Livestock Health
12.       The main animal health problems are poor general nutrition, Foot-
and-Mouth disease, Trypanosomiasis, and East Coast Fever.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
13.       The level of cattle nutrition in Tanzania varies with season, and
animals are usually underfed once or twice each year, depending on the amount
of rainfall and its distribution. No attempt is made to provide supplementary
feed such as hay or silage during these periods nor to provide areas of crop
or special-purpose pasture. Under severe conditions, older animals lose
weight to the point of emaciation and younger animals fail to grow. The
situation is often aggravated by the added stress of internal and external
parasites, disease, mineral deficiency, and lactation.
14.       Foot-and-Mouth Disease is endemic in most regions of Tanzania.
The disease is controlled by vaccination and quarantine but the program has
been handicapped by the lack of vaccines of the right type. This situation,
however, has been remedied although poor communications and inadequate stor-
age facilities for vaccines impose considerable difficulties. Government,
however, has indicated that it intends to expand efforts to contain the
disease, not only because of its effect in lowering production, but also
because it is an important constraint on the export of chilled and frozen
meats to Europe and elsewhere.
15.       The tsetse fly, the vector of Trypanosomiasis in cattle, is widely
distributed throughout the country, infesting approximately two-thirds of
the total land area. Where infestation is severe, cattle raising is virtually
excluded (para 6). This disease, however, can be eradicated by clearing areas
of the fly through a combination of bush felling and insecticide spraying, and
its effect on individual animals can be controlled by treatment with drugs.
Either of these two approaches, or a combination of both, can be used but
large-scale on-going ranching enterprises would find it more practical to
eradicate the fly from the farmed areas. Much research has been carried
out on this approach in Tanzania and elsewhere in East Africa, and an ef-
fective program, involving ring clearing of bush and aerial and ground
spraying (costing no more than Tsh 15 per ha), is now in operation under
the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives.
16.       East Coast Fever is the most important of the tick-borne diseases
and it causes serious loss in the traditional livestock sector. It is esti-
mated, for example, that some 10% of calves are lost because of the disease.
Routine dipping at weekly intervals will control this and other tick-borne
diseases and Government has built some 800 dips throughout all the main live-
stock producing areas. These facilities, plus the dipping chemicals, are
provided free of charge to producers who wish to avail themselves of the
service.
17.       Other diseases, which in the past have been a problem, such as
Rinderpest and Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia, have now been successfully
contained through well executed control programs. Approximately 1 million
animals in the north are vaccinated each year against Rinderpest to form a
barrier against reintroduction from the north. No case of the disease has
been reported in Northern Tanzania since 1965 and it is over 25 years since
it last occurred in the south. Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia was last



ANNEX 1
Page 5
diagnosed eight years ago in the north of Masailand but prompt vaccination
and quarantine of the area prevented spread and at the present time the
disease is not present in the country.
Technical Services
18.       The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives is responsible for
livestock production and marketing and also for advisory services, research,
and training within the agricultural sector. Four Divisions of the Ministry
are directly involved--the Division of Agriculture, Food, and Advisory Serv-
ices; the Division of Production Development and Technical Services; the
Division of Administration, Personnel, and Planning; and the Division of
Research, Training, and Farmer Education. The National Agricultural Company
(NACO), a subsidiary of the National Agriculture and Food Company, is the
parastatal organization through which the Ministry's main commercial produc-
tion thrust is realized.
19.       The Animal Industry Subdivision of the Division of Agriculture,
Food, and Advisory Services plays a major role in disease control, tsetse
control, stock routes, holding grounds, Al schemes, livestock multiplication
centers, meat inspection, and grading, while the Division of Production
Development and Technical Services is responsible for various commercial
undertakings of the Ministry. It shares with NACO and the Tanzanian Sisal
Corporation the main burden of organizing and executing production programs.
Project preparation and planning, the organization of marketing, and the
compilation and analysis of vital industry statistics are the chief produc-
tion-oriented functions of the Division of Administration, Personnel, and
Planning, and training extension staff, up to the diploma level, and farmers,
is the responsibility of the Division of Research, Training, and Farmer
Education, which also directs research in both animal and crop production.
20.       The key role of training at all levels is well recognized by Gov-
ernment and, insofar as projected requirements for technicians trained to
the certificate and diploma levels in general agriculture are concerned,
its requirements through 1980 will be met by existing training schemes.
The need for more graduates in agriculture at the degree level is also
recognized and appropriate steps are being taken to increase enrollment in
the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Dar-es-Salaam, Norogoro.
21.       In order to broaden the training schemes presently being sponsored
by the Division of Research, Training, and Farmer Education, the Division,
in collaboration with NACO, is organizing a diploma course in Ranch Manage-
ment. Candidates will already have had several years of field experience as
a condition of entry. They will attend a refresher course in theory subjects
at the Ministry's Training Institute at Mpwapwa, followed by a practical
course in Ranch Management at NACO's Mkata ranch. The length of the course
will be two years. Twelve students will be trained per year and it is antic-
ipated that graduates will not only fill key managerial posts on NACO ranches
but will provide personnel to occupy production posts in the Ministry, the
Tanzanian Rural Development Bank, and other parastatal entities such as the
Tanzania Sisal Corporation.



ANNEX 1
Page 6
22.       NACO operates its own in-service training program for headmen and
field assistants, with supervision provided by individual ranch managers.
Farmer groups are also encouraged to visit NACO ranches to see the units at
first hand and field days are organized for further demonstration purposes.
23.       Recently, in order to broaden the training and experience of its
established ranch managers, NACO entered into an agreement with an Australian
consultancy firm to provide a practical training course in that country on
certain advanced ranches in areas with climatic patterns and production
problems similar to those in Tanzania. It is expected that a dozen or more
of NACO's senior ranch managers will take part in this program over the
next three to four years.
24.       The situation with respect to research is not as satisfactory as
it is with training. In general, the quality of veterinary research in
Tanzania is good as borne out by the effectiveness of the dipping program
and the tsetse control program. However, there is a definite gap in
production-oriented research and, while NACO has done much to show that
higher production coefficients are possible, a great deal more needs to be
done in such basic fields as brush and weed control, water reticulation,
fencing, pasture utilization, supplementary feeding, fertilization, and
animal management. What is required is a series of feasibility trials on
existing NACO ranches, adopting a strict minimum cost - maximum effective-
ness approach. Government, through NACO, is fully aware of these gaps and
has indicated a desire to correct the situation.
Government Policy Towards Livestock Development
25.       Government has gone to considerable lengths to define constraints
in the livestock industry and has indicated its determination to do every-
thing possible to promote expansion. It has noted with concern the problem
of overstocking in many areas and has provided good support for the Tsetse
Control Unit, whose main responsibilities are to control the fly and under-
take construction of roads and firebreaks for access and burn protection and
dams for water storage and reticulation.
26.       In order to improve the social amenities of the traditional pro-
ducer and to provide a basis for more effective extension of improved man-
agement practices, Government is pushing ahead as quickly as possible with
the concept of ujamaa, which is explained in detail in Annex 2. Suitable
land for settlement by ujamaa villagers is available presently or is being
made available as the work of the Tsetse Control Unit progresses. Govern-
ment believes that, given better social services, suitable land, modest
physical inputs, technology, and a rational marketing system, the tradi-
tional sector is capable of significantly increasing production to meet
the needs of both the expanding internal and export markets.

TANZANIA
SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Social Implications of Cattle Ranch Development
by Ujamaa Cooperatives
A. Introduction
1.        Ujamaa, a Swahili word meaning familyhood is an innovative form of
socio-economic organization to be applied for the first time under the Proj-
ect to ranching. The ujamaa ranch would be the vehicle for altering the
relationship between such people and their herds from one that is intermittent-
ly market-oriented, where animals are sold occasionally, to one that is basic-
ally commercial.  The ranches, which would directly involve about 3,500 people
and 34,500 animals in four different parts of the country, would be small-scale
duplicates, technically, of the larger and already established NACO ranches.
2.        A second innovation to be introduced by the Project, also aimed at
facilitating commercialization of beef production for the keepers of the trad-
itional herd of about 13 million animals, is the establishment of a countrywide
network of stock routes, holding grounds, and markets, initegrated with new
meat processing facilities. This effort would indirectly involve many more
people and animals than would the ranch component itself, even though there
would be no substantive changes in the socio-economic organization. In the
next five years, this second innovation would probably have the greater im-
pact since the first is a long-range means of bringing about the necessary
change in attitude toward commercial beef production.
3.        The Tanzanian Government sought IDA financing for 90 10,000-acre
ujamaa ranches in unspecified areas in addition to the wi:Lsa ujamaa ranches
(for Haya of West Lake Region). The double innovation of the ranch technical
package (firebreaks, dams, disease control and range management) at this
scale and ujamaa organization, however, precludes its introduction in any
but the most favored places. Accordingly, the number has been reduced to
15 and the places and peoples specified. The places were selected on the
basis of type of husbandry and commercial orientation, population density,
semi-arid range habitat, tsetse clearance requirements, probably avail-
ability of water, and recent preinvestment research by other agencies.
Adjusting the two innovations to different peoples and habitats involves
many socio-economic variables, however, and what follows iLs an outline of
observations designed to support the recommendations and guide their imple-
mention.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
B. Ujamaa
4.        Ujamaa are economic and social communities where people volunteer
to live together and work together for the good of all. Physical resettle-
ment and the new type of organization are commonly combined. Ujamaa are
constructed on socialist principles and, as such, are clearly in the fore-
front of government policy as a means of breaking the cycle of rural poverty.
Many new communities have been formed along these lines since the Arusha
Declaration in 1967, some plagued by poor planning, but none has yet been
aimed specifically at livestock production. As many as 5,000 ujamaa villages
have been started, most of them in Dodoma Region during the summer of 1971.
Of this total only about 160 have so far qualified for registration as credit
worthy cooperatives.
5.        The proposal to apply ujamaa principles to ranches is in accord
with an observation made by the Bank's Economic Survey Mission to Tanganyika
in 1959, which drew attention to the need for partnership cattle ranching
in which Africans would run cattle under skilled management provided by some
public body. When President Nyerere's formulation of ujamaa in his paper
on Socialism and Rural Development included an endorsement for ujamaa in the
livestock sector, the stage was set. He also stressed the importance of a
gradual approach and flexibility in planning.
6.        An ujamaa ranch would recruit members willing to move to the
ranch site, contribute animals to give it a start, contribute labor to run
the ranch, and accept the principle of some communal ownership of property.
The ranch member would also have to be willing to accept the discipline im-
posed by the technical management and to tolerate a rather low standard of
living for a period of up to 10 years. However, he would be better off than
he was before becoming a member and although his cash income remains small
for about 10 years he would build up a substantial asset over this period.
Additionally, he would have to be receptive and able to learn the decision-
making processes critical to the successful operation of the ranch. In
exchange, the ranch member could anticipate having a share in a financially
productive enterprise after the 10-year period. The man who contributes
cattle for himself, or his son, and his labor would be investing in a new
and alternative mode of life. Ujamaa have been likened to kibbutzim, but
the elements of persecution, return to a homeland, and ready familiarity with
western technology are, of course, not present. It is most realistic to view
ujamaa as an indigenous attempt to harness African concepts of communal work
and property to modern requirements for successful commercial enterprise.
7.        In general, ujamaa have so far been handicapped by being located
in the least favored parts of Tanzania where the need is great but community
resources minimal. Ujamaa ranches are, therefore, proposed for areas where
community resources and support would be available until the ranches become
established. In order to recruit successfully and maintain inputs, the
ranches must be able to attract men who are competent and from families who
own cattle. However, such persons cannot be readily recruited unless they



ANNEX 2
Page 3
have reasonable assurance of their investment being safeguarded. An effective
means of providing a realistic and workable interface between the ujanaa
principles enunciated by President Nyerere and the ujamaa ranches in the form
recommended here is through the constitutions to be drawn for each ranch of
the four areas.
C. Cattle
8.        Only those Tanzanian rural societies with a well-established cattle
keeping tradition should be considered at this time, thus excluding many in
Tanzania who are dominantly or completely horticultural. Eighty-five percent
of the traditional herd is kept in Northern Tanzania. Although the numbers
to be directly recruited for ranch membership are very snall, Masai, Gogo,
Sukuma, and Haya peoples control 40% of the entire traditional herd and to-
gether comprise 24% of the country's population. Masai are completely pas-
toral, Gogo primarily so, Sukuma keep cattle as major investment property
along with cropping, and Haya have an ancient practice of integrating herding
with tree crop farming. There are obvious advantages in access to and expe-
rience with peoples controlling this portion of the herd. Sukuma and Gogo
herd owners would also have general access to the stock route-dip complex
in addition to members directly recruited for ujamaa ranches.
9.        The traditional herd is a multipurpose resource.  Cattle provide
food through being milked, butchered, and bled; manure for use as fertilizer
in mixed husbandry regimes and as fuel; power as draft animals, and raw ma-
terials for craft use. They are also an important indigenous means of in-
vestment and exchange used in underwriting marriage transactions (bride-
wealth), pacts of friendship and clientship (loan), and inheritance or
guardianship (trusteeship). Cattle are prizes in raids and objects of
theft, and can be used to pay fines and settle debts. They figure sym-
bolically and actually in rituals and life-cycle ceremonies. For pastoral
peoples, the well-being of the herd is, therefore, the dominant value.
10.       However inconsistent such variety of use may appear with conversion
to strict commercial utilization, the traditional distinction between dairy
and slaughter animals, and the size of the herd allow sufficient flexibility
for experimentation.
11.       Ownership of the traditional herd is concentrated in the hands of
a relative few by availability of suitable habitat (approximately 30% of the
country), age and sex (nearly all owners are older, adult men), and unequal
distribution (except for Masai, between 30 and 50% of the adult men own all
the cattle and, of these, 10% own half the animals). However, a prolifera-
tion of rights has resulted from trusteeship and loan arrangements. Plurality
of rights, in fact, is such a complicating factor that a proper question is
whether all Tanzanian owners can sell their cattle or cont:ribute them to
ujamaa ranches rather than will they as a matter of volition.



ANNEX 2
Page 4
12.       The problem of increasing offtake from the traditional herd has
frequently been tackled in the past through destocking programs aimed at
improving range quality through a reduction in numbers, with culled animals
becoming available for slaughter. These programs, however, have been viewed
by African cattle owners as repressive, and considerable resistance has de-
veloped to innovations involving cattle. An increase in quality of cattle
and an increase in numbers is demonstrated, though, in the example provided
by the existing NACO ranches and that combination is consistent with the
values and interests of the cattle keeping peoples being considered. At
the technical level, the ujamaa ranches, especially, and the stock route
dip-market complex promise the positive combination and are supportive rather
than repressive measures. Insofar as these are so perceived, they should
be acceptable.
D.  Other Factors in Selection of Ujamaa Sites
13.       Only areas with low population density (0 to 15 per square mile)
are considered suitable for ujamaa ranch location. Optimum ranch size,
determined by technical considerations, is 10,000 ha, and a ranch community,
determined by social and labor considerations, is 60 families, with an esti-
mated population density of seven per square mile. Most mixed husbandry re-
gimes involve population densities well above this level and what appears to
be available pasturage is in reality communal grazing land, usually divided
into wet and dry season portions, with a drought period reserve. It is ex-
ceedingly risky to enclose such land for the benefit of a relatively small
number of ujamaa ranch members for two reasons: those with rights to that
area will attempt to exercise them in any event (regardless of formal tenure
changes) and will be especially attracted to do so when new facilities are
added; and fear of retaliation from those deprived of rights could easily
prevent a farmer from joining an ujamaa ranch. The aim, therefore, should
be to bring essentially unused land into productive use rather than attempt
to rework existing holdings in a new manner. At the same time, such areas
should be physically proximate to the habitat of cattle keeping peoples.
Ujamaa ranch sites proposed here have low population density due to lack of
water supplies (Nindo, Segara-Izava and Masai) (Appendices 1 and 2). Such
a policy would also provide a new social opportunity for those willing,
simultaneously, to move and to enter into a new form of organization.
14.       The natural habitat suitable for cattle in East Africa is called
"semi-arid range", and it occurs over 30% of mainland Tanzania territory.
All of the proposed ujamaa ranch sites are within the semi-arid range.
15.       Tsetse clearance is prohibitively difficult for ujamaa ranches and
sites requiring such work would not be selected unless clearance were as-
sumed by another agency.
16.       Water supplies are a major constraint on Ujamaa areas which other-
wise are suitable for cattle ranching and the provision of water will be
financed under the Project.



ANNEX 2
Page 5
17.       Prior or complementary work has been or will be done in each of
the areas by UNDP/SF (Nindo and Segara-Izava and Masai) and USAID.
E. The Constitution
18.       The constitution for each ujamaa ranch should make provision for
the social organization of the ranch community and include clauses adaptive
to the particular character of the society involved.
F. General Conclusion
19.       The real incentive for prospective ranch members and for government
is that commercial beef production is feasible in Tanzania. Building the
necessary social safeguards can be done as long as the need to do so is
understood. The incentives for joining ujamaa are the provision of ranch
infrastructure, the restoration of a favored area, or the well being of the
herd (Masai) and the long-term prospect of a good income. The disincentives
are the long, lean years and the novelty of ujamaa cattle ranching. The risks,
however, can be reduced through careful planning and thorough explanation to
prospective members, and by the clarification of rights and duties in the
ujamaa constitution.
G.  Procedure for Establishing Credit for Ujamaa Ranches
20.       Following the formation of the ujamaa villages:
(a) each village would register as a primary or probationary
primary society under the Cooperative Societies Act, 1968;
(b) a certificate of occupancy would be obtained for each
village, such certificate to guarantee to the village
the exclusive use of the land allocated to it; and
(c) where balanced husbandry and good resource conservation
require the land to be managed in large units, farming
groups comprised of several villages should be formed.
The function of these farming groups, which might be
registered as secondary societies under the Cooperative
Societies Act (in which case they could be known as
Farming Unions), would:



ANNEX 2
Page 6
(i) through their elected representatives, manage
the land they collectively occupy to make the
best use of it for crop and livestock produc-
tion; and
(ii) severally and collectively implement the recom-
mended development program.
21.       When such Farming Unions are formed, their rules and by-laws regard-
ing land management and resource conservation would prevail over any rules
that might be made by an individual member village. In the case of the
Masai District and any other areas which are well suited to animal husbandry
practiced under an extensive system of management:
(a) encourage the other farm families in the area to form
themselves into Ranching Cooperatives large enough
to be viable under a livestock regime, register them,
-and then obtain a certificate of occupancy for each; and
(b) proceed to the formation of Farming Unions, the member-
ship of which would comprise one Ranching Cooperative
and such cultivator villages as may have been formed
within its boundaries or adjacent to it.
22.       Any Ujamaa Village and Ranching Associations formed in gazetted
Range Development Areas prior to the coming into force of the proposed
Agricultural Development and Resources Conservation Act should be certified
by the Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives.
H. Recommendations
23.       As part of the appraisal of proposed ujamaa cooperatives, the
Project Management Unit and TRDB should examine the following matters:
(a) drafting of the ujamaa ranch constitution;
(b) document of registration as a cooperative society
(and whether primary or multipurpose);
(c) areas gazetted under the Range Management Practice Act
in relation to ujamaa ranch sites;
(d) determination of stage (I-III) of development of ujamaa
of the ujamaa ranches;
(e) preparation of ranch; consultation with prospective ranch
members familiar with the area;



ANNEX 2
Page 7
(f)  consultation with prospective village members familiar
with the area; and
(g) clarification of the rights and responsibilities; of
present inhabitants of ujamaa ranch sites, their choice
of joining the ujamaa, and the disposition of their stock.

Ujamaa Ranching Through Utilization of Existing Pasture
and Residential Land: Nindo, Segara-Izava, and Masai
Nindo
1.        The set of ujamaa ranches proposed for the Nindo area of Shinyanga
District and Region would utilize a portion of the cultivation steppe now
rather sparsely populated by Sukumaland standards. Heretofore, the prin-
cipal lack has been availability of water supplies and these will be pro-
vided under the Project.
2.        The Sukuma, a significantly large group in Tanzania, are Bantu
speaking, practice a type of mixed husbandry involving grain crops, surplus
portions of which are sold, with cotton as the chief cash crop and cattle
as the principal item of investment. The traditional herd is estimated at
3 million head. Sukuma social organization involves a flexible interplay
among kin, neighborhood ward, and secret society memberships. A relevant
characteristic is multiplicity of rights arising from the several member-
ships and applied to cattle, water, and grazing rights (as well as to other
aspects of social and economic life). Grazing and water supplies are allo-
cated to wet season, dry season, and drought season (kept in long-term re-
serve) categories. Consolidating rights and clarifying lines of responsibil-
ity should be done, and can be done as long as the need to do so is recognized.
In the Nindo area, there is unoccupied land. Familiarity with the local ter-
rain on the part of prospective ranch members would be an asset in preparing
the ranch plan. Communal herding of animals is often practiced under indi-
genous management in the Nindo area and this also would be an asset.
3.        UNDP/FAO study of Ranching Associations in other parts of Sukuma
country concludes that paddocking, improved water supplies, and dipping
already introduced under other loose management are slowly but effectively
being integrated into animal management practice. In theise newly improved
areas, however, encroachment by non-Association persons has been a problem.
The enclosure problem is evident here. Another finding oE the study with
respect to marketing indicates wide acceptance of cash cropping in the
agricultural sector and modest acceptance of commercial sale of cattle in
the livestock sector. With the proposed Nindo ujamaa ranches, the pace
of instituting the technical package would be accelerated and ranch manage-
ment would be tight. The single-purpose ranch is also an innovation relative
to the Ranching Association approach. In view of the sizeB and importance
of the traditional herd in Sukumaland, the Nindo ujamaa ranches are a
necessary experiment. Given the sparse population and the favorable set
of ecological conditions, the possibility of success is enihanced.
4.        Special care should be taken to:
(a) ascertain water and grazing rights at present a:Llocated
to dry, wet, and drought season use in the proposed area;



ANNEX 2
Appendix 1
Page 2
(b) ascertain the verbiage, in Kisukuma, used to designate
the contribution of animals made by ranch members; and
(c) delineate the boundaries of the ranch area.
Segara-Izava
5.        The two 10,000-ha ranches proposed for Segara and Izava villages
in Dodoma region would be located in the area selected for development by
the UNDP/SF because the plant cover by all vegetation types is good, and,
with adequate disease control facilities, the potential for livestock
production is also good.
6.        Approximately 60 Bantu-speaking families, mostly Gogo, live in
Segara, and a similar number, mostly Nguu, live in Izava, Gogo have a
strong pastoral tradition, but they also cultivate; Nguu are primarily
cultivators and are more commercially minded than the Gogo. At present,
1,400 owners' animals are being run on the ranches on which preliminary
survey work has been completed.
7.        Segara and Izava ujamaa villages are part of a major district-
wide resettlement carried out between M4ay and September of 1971. The two
villages are on the periphery of the ranch sites and already conform to
the model village plan designed by UNDP advisors. By 1973, they expect
to be registered as Ranching Cooperative Societies and this follows the
UNDP recommendation as well as being consistent with ujamaa policy.
8.        Special care should be taken to ensure that:
(a) ranch-member families number no more than 100 and
preferably 40-60;
(b) Gogo in Segara and Nguu in Izava retain a natural separation
in the two villages in the interest of greater harmony and
ease of work;
(c) owner's rights and responsibilities on contributed cattle
be ascertained and discussed with ranch members, especially
in regard to bridewealth payments;
(d) appropriate regional and party authorities participate in
plans and commitments; and
(e) consideration be given to the model village plans
designed by UNDP/SF.



ANNEX 2
Appendix 1

Masai
9.        The eight dispersed Masai ujamaa ranches proposed in Arusha
District would be established in conjunction with Ranching Associations
formed under the Range Development and Management Act. Technical services
and heavy equipment would be supplied by USAID; loans will be primarily
for dips and water facilities.
10.       The Masai, well known as pastoralists in TanzaniaL (and Kenya)
would be contributing a nucleus herd of 500 breeding cows from each
Ranching Association. Administratively, the ujamaa ranches represent an
attempt to adapt the Ranching Association format to the req[uirements of
ujamaa policy.  More broadly, both Ranching Associations and ujamaa ranches
are designed to aid in transforming Masai management practice, and ideology
with respect to marketing, to take advantage of introduced techniques and
Masai skill and endurance in cattle husbandry under conditions pertaining
in the Masai steppe.
11.       In the opinion of USAID advisors, administrative problems will
be simpler if boundaries of each Ranching Association and ujamaa ranch fall
within a single Ward.
12.       Special care should be taken to:
(a)  meet the special requirements of forming ujamaa ranches
within the Ranching Association;
(b)  determine the viability of separating the Mfasai residential
compound from the cattle night paddock to allow the former
to be relatively permanent and the latter to be moved as
necessity dictates;
(c) plan for the installation of facilities (schools, dispensaries,
water supplies, shops, etc.) concurrently with planning for
the ranch proper.

TANZANIA
SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Tanzania Livestock Marketing Company (TLMC)
A. Introduction
1.        Marketed offtake from the cattle population is low in Tanzania--
averaging about 2.6% during 1959-70. During 1971, the total number of cattle
marketed was 333,000 out of an estimated population of 13 million cattle.
Two factors are considered to be primarily responsible for this low figure:
(a) the organization and operation of the livestock marketing
system; and
(b) the controlled price of beef in the cities, leading to low
producer prices.
These factors are complementary and have to be taken into account together.
The Project would, therefore, place all marketing, stock routes, and holding
grounds under the direction and control of a parastatal--Tanzania Livestock
Marketing Company (TLMC)--set up as a subsidiary of the National Agriculture
and Food Company (NAFCO). TLMC would purchase livestock in markets which it
would operate and manage and it would facilitate cattle movement on stock
routes and holding grounds which it also would operate. Disease control
would continue to be the responsibility, however, of the veterinary depart-
ment of the Ministry of Agriculture.
B. Background
Livestock Markets
2.        There are two types of livestock markets in Tanzania--secondary
and primary. Secondary markets are operated on a weekly basis by the
veterinary department of the Ministry of Agriculture and there are five in
the country. Owners bringing cattle to the secondary markets are required
to show proof of prior vaccination against FMID, blackquarter, and anthrax,
but enforcement is difficult and quarantines have led to outside sales, which
has had a bad effect on the health control effort. Primary markets, at
which cattle can be sold without prior vaccination, are operated by District
Development Councils (DDC) on a monthly basis. About 220 primary markets
are supposed to be in existence, of which approximately 116 can be classi-
fied as permanent. The classification of a market as permanent is based
upon the type of facilities available and not upon the regularity of operation.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
Market Facilities
3.        Physical facilities at all markets are generally inadequate.  Per-
manent markets are usually of stone or pipe construction but, due to poor
maintenance, they have deteriorated. In most cases, broken corral fences
are repaired by placing a thorn bush in the gap. Temporary markets are
no more than improvised thorn bush corrals with pole-type structures for
the auctioneer. Few have crush facilities.
Market Charges
4.        Charges vary from district to district.  In some, they are paid by
the buyer as a percentage of sale value, while in others, there is a fixed
charge per head. In some, charges are paid by the seller. The table below
provides some examples:
District           Seller's Cost           Buyer's Cost               Total
Masailand            2 sh/head           5% of value               7 to 22/head
Mwanze               6 sh/head           6 sh/head                   12/head
Shinyanga            2 sh/head                                        2/head
Mara                 5 sh/head           5 sh/head                   10/head
Dodoma                                   5% of sale value          5 to 20/head
Before the practice was discontinued in 1971, markets also served as places
in which to collect taxes, party dues, and other fees. This, however, acted
as a discriminative to producers who, partially to avoid these payments, chose
to sell instead to bush traders.
Handling Procedures
5.        Cattle handling procedures in markets are inefficient.  Before the
auction begins, cattle are held outside the auction ring and producers have
to herd their own cattle with canes. Minor modifications in handling proce-
dures, such as the use of rubber rather than wood to handle animals, could
lead to substantial reduction in bruising and other changes in preauction
sorting and post-auction handling could further reduce damage due to mis-
handling.
Selling Procedures
6.        Selling procedures are also highly variable, depending on whether
the DDC allows competition or not. IThere DDC is the sole buyer, the auction-
ing process is purely procedureal. Cattle are brought into the ring and the
DDC buyer starts the bidding; he continues to bid against himself until he
reaches the price he wants to pay; which producer may accept or reject. In
markets where other buyers (TPL, traders, etc.) are present, the auctioning
is fair. At both of the above types, a substantial part (70% or so) of the
sales occur without the animal entering the auction ring.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
Major Buyers
7.        The major buyers at the markets are the DDC, TPL buyers, bush
traders, foreign buyers, and local butchers. The breakdown in 1970 was
as follows:
Percent
Buyer                           Total       of Total
(1000)
Urban/Rural Butchers
(excluding Dar es Salaam)                182            51
Tanganyika Packers, Ltd:                    103           29
Through DDC                               (72)         (20)
Through Private Traders                   (21)          (6)
Through Own Buyers                        (10)          (3)

360           100
8.        DDC's have been buying for the local butchers since 1969 when
Government restricted the operation of private buyers.  The DDC's buy
cattle at their auction markets; pay the veterinary, stock: route, and hold-
ing ground fees; assume death losses; and sell the animals on a dressed
carcass weight basis.
9.        Tanganyika Packers Ltd (TPL) uses DDC's, private traders, and
salaried buyers to purchase cattle for its plant, which supplies fresh
meat to Dar es Salaam and produces canned corned beef for export. Its
estimated capacity is 300,000 head annually, of which 200,000 is for can-
ning but, so far, it has never operated at full capacity. Its highest
throughput was achieved in 1969 when it killed 164,000 cattle.  The supply
of cattle has been a bottleneck to increasing production since export
prospects for corned beef are attractive and TPL's part owmer, Liebigs,
markets its well-known brand--Fray Bentos--in the UK.
10.       Foreign (Kenya, Uganda, and Zambia) buyers also operate in Tanzania
and in 1970 bought about 30,000 cattle. It is expected that meat shortages
in Uganda and Zambia are likely to last for at least a decade and Tanzania
could also profitably supply these markets.
Shortcomings of the Marketing System
11.       The markets as such are not organized professionally.  Even though
DDC's operate them, they do not seem to assume responsibiiLty for maintenance
and upkeep. Further, due to lack of experience and lack of capital, they



ANNEX 3
Page 4
have been generally unsuccessful as buyers and sellers. The stock routes
and holding grounds are also in a state of disrepair. Maintenance and up-
keep is the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture, which does have
the professional expertise but not the capital. After considerable trial
and error, the Government has therefore decided to create the parastatal
TLMC to serve as the major buyer of livestock and the guardian of the mar-
kets, stock routes, and holding grounds.
C. The Tanzania Livestock Marketing Company
12.       TLMC would be organized on a zonal basis:
(a)  Northern Zone:  Arusha, Kilimanjaro, Tanga regions;
(b)  Central Zone:  Singida, Dodoma, Morogoro and Coast regions;
(c) Western Zone: West Lake, Mara, Mwanza, Shinyanga and Tabora
regions;
(d)  Southern Zone:  Mbeya and Iringa regions.
Headquarters would be in Dar es Salaam, with one office in each of the four
zones. The zonal offices would be established over three years.
13.       The company would commence operations on a phased basis.  In Year 1,
TLMC would establish one buyer each in Shinyanga, Arusha, and Dodoma, who
would buy in DDC-operated markets in competition with other buyers. In
Year 2, the company would begin taking over markets from the DDC's and the
stock routes and holding grounds from the Ministry of Agriculture.
14.       The company would operate weekly and monthly markets through
market teams, consisting of a market master, auctioneer, two clerks, and
day laborers. Each team would conduct one weekly and 12 monthly markets
a month. A team would, therefore, have about 200 market days per year. The
development of markets and market teams by zones would be as follows:
Year

ANNEX 3
Page 5
This gives a total of 13 weekly and 124 monthly markets and a total of 2,164
market days per year. The weekly markets would be of two sizes: 1,000 cattle
per day and 500 cattle per day. The capital cost of the former would be
Tsh 150,000 per market and, for the latter, Tsh 100,000 per market.
15.       The total investment in TULC is estimated to be Tsh 20.6 million

TANZANIA
SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Meat Processing
A. Introduction
Background
1.        Apart from purely home killing, slaughtering is currently carried
out in Tanzania by some 62 district and municipal abattoirs, by three ranch
abattoirs, by licensed rural butchers, and by Tanganyika Packers Ltd. (TPL)
at their plant near Dar es Salaam.  The TPL plant, built in 1950 and owned
51% by Government and 49% by Brooke Bond Liebig of London, not only supplies
the rapidly expanding Dar es Salaam meat market but is the only export meat
packing plant operating in Tanzania at the present time.  It has an annual
slaughter capacity of 300,000 head, including 200,000 head processed into
canned meat, and Brooke Bond Liebig has responsibility for marketing all
exported processed meat, the bulk of which is sold in the UJnited Kingdom.
Scope of Project
2.        The meat processing component of the Project involves (a) extensive
sanitary improvements to the TPL plant to assure its approval by the UK
veterinary authorities and continued entry of its produce iLnto the UK market;
(b) the construction of two new plants--one in the city of Mbeya, 580 miles
southwest of Dar es Salaam and the other near the city of Shinyanga, 638 miles
west of Dar es Salaam. Each of these plants would have a slaughtering capacity
of 50,000 head per year and would increase offtake from the traditional sector
by providing an outlet for cull cows and bulls.
3.        Tanganyika Packers Ltd. Plant.  The TPL plant is located 10 miles
north of Dar es Salaam, with access by road only. Cattle received by rail
unload at Pugu 15 miles east and are trekked the rest of the way. The plant
started operating in 1950 and is equipped to slaughter about 300,000 head
yearly, which includes 200,000 head for canned corned beef in 12-oz and 7-oz
cans. It also produces meat and bone extract for export and canned petfood.
Inedible offal is processed into meat and bone meal, tallow, and hoof and
horn meal. Hides are salted but blood is wasted as there are no drying
facilities. Table 1 shows the projected investment for the TPL plant and
Table 2 the sales and operating expenses.
4.        Slaughtering, boning, canning, and edible and inedible offal
processing are carried out in a large two-story concrete st:ructure. Except
for the inedible rendering facilities, the plant and its equipment are in



ANNEX 4
Page 2
good condition. Although layout and product flow is functional, modern
sanitary standards of design and layout are lacking, making remodelling
necessary immediately to meet UK processing and hygiene standards for plants
exporting processed meats to the UK market.
5.        Mbeya Plant.  The Mbeya plant, located in the southwestern zone,
would have a planned throughput of 28,000 head per year, including 5,000
head of good quality steers for export to Zambia. The good quality cattle
would be supplied from the National Agricultural Company (NACO) and District
Development Council ranches in the area to be financed under the Project.
Table 3 shows the projected investment for the Mbeya plant and Table 4 the
sales and operating expenses.
6.        Shinyanga Plant.  The Shinyanga plant, located in the Central Zone,
would have an estimated annual volume of 33,500 head, including 20,000 head
of good quality cattle from the NACO ranches in the West Lake area for canning
at TPL. This outlet would yield the next best return since export to Zambia
would not be possible because the zone is not FID free, a basic Zambia
requirement. Table 5 shows the projected investment for the Shinyanga plant
and Table 6 the sales and operating expenses.
B. Investment
7.        Total Project costs of the meat processing component are estimated
at US$5.4 million, detailed as follows:

8.        The original request to IDA was for US$14.8 million, but investment
costs were reduced by making the following main changes:
(a) a separate construction for all inedible processing would be
built for TPL rather than the separate slaughtering building
originally requested, which would be considerably more
expensive;



ANNEX 4
Page 3
(b)  no canning facilities would be constructed at the Shinyanga
plant. Since the TPL plant in Dar es Salaam has a functional
canning operation, frozen meat would be sent there from the
Shinyanga plant for processing;
(c)  no working capital for cattle purchases for the two new
plants would be financed;
(d)  the Arusha plant would not be remodelled as the work could
not be justified.
C. Project Works
TPL Plant
9.        The reconstruction work at the Tanganyika Packers Ltd. plant would
be phased over three years with that needed to meet UK sanitary requirements
to be carried out in the first year.
(a)  Work to be Carried out in Project Year 1
(i)  relocate bone cooking equipment to the soup handling
area on the first floor;
(ii) close off the existing loading funnels for melters on
the second floor and install mechanized loading on the
first floor;
(iii)  erect two insulated beef coolers (capacity 350 cattle),
with rails and evaporator coils on area ma,de vacant
by (i);
(iv) install a third cooler on the first floor (capacity
350 cattle);
(v)  install two inclined conveyors for lowering carcasses
from slaughter floor to cooler on the first floor and
to local sales area, and for elevating carcasses
from the cooler to the boning room on the second floor;
(vi) completely separate the killing floor and cookroom from
the boning room, which should be designed and equipped
(wash basins and sterilizing equipment) to required
sanitation standards; and
(vii) carry out improvement works to meet required standards
for lighting, ventilation, and insect and rodent control.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
(b) Work to be Carried out in Project Years 2 and 3. All works under
this Project would meet the specification and sanitary codes
required by the US, UK, and EEC.
(i)  remodel killing floor, separating the bleeding area
from the skinning and dressing areas, and install
facilities for on-the-rail dressing;
(ii) install conveyor rail enabling carcasses to be spaced
and avoiding contact between healthy and diseased
carcasses;
(iii)  provide for identification of head, viscera, and carcass
until final inspection;
(iv) install controlled access points to edible-product areas
to ensure that all personnel undergo a hygiene routine
before entering the killing floor;
(v)  construct additional coolers and a freezer store on the
ground floor of the main building to hold frozen meat
from the Shinyanga and Nbeya plants after relocating the
existing inedible rendering equipment to a new building
on the east side of the main building;
(vi) replace any melters that need removing and install a
blood drier;
(vii) provide facilities, including cattle pens and autopsy
room, for slaughtering sick and condemned animals
separately;
(viii) carry out necessary repairs on cattle pen floors and
install sanitary curbs and drains; and
(ix) ensure that all equipment and surfaces in contact with
meat products are stainless steel, providing stainless
steel basins, sterilizers, and bench surfaces in the
product area.
Shinyanga and Mbeya Plants
10.       Civil Works and Sanitary Standards.  The plants would be designed,
built, and equipped to meet the meat inspection sanitary standards of the US,
UK and EEC. This applies particularly to the layout and product flow, which
determine the shape of the buildings.
11.       All slaughtering and edible product handling would be carried out
in a single-story building, with a flat concrete ceiling and cement block
walls finished on the inside to give an impervious washable surface. Concrete



ANNEX 4
Page 5
floors would be pitched and finished with abrasion- and impact-resistant
surface and standard drains would be provided. All openLngs would be
screened. Mechanical ventilation and standard levels of illumination in
work and inspection areas would be provided. Two insulated beef coolers
(200-head capacity each) would be installed within the main building, along
with rails and refrigerating equipment. A store with freezer capacity for
15 days' production would also be supplied.
12.       The processing of inedible by-products would be carried out in a
separate shed-type building, having concrete floor and b:Lock walls, designed
on a modular plan to allow for possible future expansion,. The roof would be
constructed of corrugated galvanized sheeting on supporting structures. The
building required to house utilities and provide storage space for hides
would be of similar construction, while the building to house offices,
cafeteria, laboratory, and infirmary would have a concrete roof and concrete
block walls. Shaded cattle pens would have pitched concrete floors with
individual drains, sanitary curbs, and water trough. A standard inspection
pen and a race with footbath leading to the killing floor would also be
provided as would storage space for frozen products (two weeks' production),
inedible products (two weeks' production), and hides (six weeks' production).
13.       Processing Capacity.  Buildings would be desigrned for a cattle
slaughtering rate of 25 head per hour by one eight-hour shift per day.
Equipment would be purchased to handle the projected kill of about 160 head
per day and extra equipment could be added as required for increased
throughput.
14.       Killing Floor and Complementary Areas.  All equipment that would
come in contact with meat products would be of stainless steel. On-the-wall
dressing and mechanical skinning knives are not recommended. Provision
would be made for identification of the viscera, head, and carcass until
final inspection, and lock stops would be used on the rail to prevent
contact between carcasses. Washbasins and sterilizers would be carefully
located and access to the processing area would be confined to controlled
points, using a strict hygiene routine. An autopsy room, emergency slaughter
room, and crematory tank for rendering dead and condemned beasts would also
be provided.
15.       Boning and Curring Room.  This area would be windowless and
insulated and its temperature maintained at 70C. Stainless steel boning
tables and trucking equipment and bandsaw for dissecting quarters into primal
cuts would be used. Stainless steel belt conveyors are not considered
necessary but stainless steel sterilizers and washbasins would be installed.
Consideration would be given to using plate freezers placed inside the boning
room for freezing the boneless meat.
16.       By-products.  Processing equipment for by-products would include
conventional mechanized rendering equipment, hasher-washer for soft material
and a grinder for hard material, melter-driers, expellers, grinders, mills,
percolating pans, and tallow tanks.

17.       Transport of Frozen Heat.  Frozen meat blocks would be transported
to TPL in insulated trucks. A hauling contract would be arranged with the
National Cold Storage Company, owners and operators of the necessary equipment,
to service a widely dispersed cold storage chain. The feasibility of using
this method of transport was established during appraisal. In addition, a
medium-size truck would be provided.
18.       Utilities.  Package-type steam generators would be used.  A
refrigeration plant with ancillary equipment, fuel storage, and equipment
for water treatment would be provided. The present electric power supply is
inadequate and, although plans have been made to increase it in Shinyanga,
the time schedule is vague and it was, therefore, deemed prudent to make
provisions for installing diesel generating sets. The water supply would
come from a new dam to be built on the Ningwa River about 4 km from the
proposed site. The dam could provide up to 300,000 gallons per day to the
plant, which is more than adequate. The financing of this dam is, at present,
being negotiated with Sweden. Settling tanks, rapid filters, and chlorinat-
ing equipment would be provided at the plant since the water supply for the
dam will not be treated.
19.       Effluent.  Effluent disposal tanks would allow primary separation
of solid material and fat and subsequent anaerobic fermentation in a large
pond, and provision would be made for effluent disposal by percolation into
the ground.
20.       Basic data for the two plants is summarized below:

Implementation and Management
21.       The three plants under the Project would be ownted by the Tanzania
Meat Processing Company, a proposed subsidiary of NAFCO, with headquarters
in Dar es Salaam and branches at Hbeya and Shinyanga.  The manager of the
company would be responsible for implementation of the meat processing
component of the Project, and he would be assisted by an expatriate specialist
in meat processing, financed under the Project. Investment and projected
operating expenses for the company are included in Table 7.



ANNEX 4

D. Financial Projections
22.       Financial projections for the Meat Processing Company (Table 8) shows
that the short-term loan for comparatively small investments would be repaid
in Year 5, after which a substantial cash surplus would begin to accumulate,
amounting to US$2.4 million in the tenth year. The profit and loss pro-
jections (Table 9) anticipate a positive cash flow in the third year and
an annual cash flow of about US$1 million after the fourth year, allowing
an adequate margin for the repayment of long-term debt.
23.       By Project Year 4, the total foreign exchange generated from the
incremental meat exports over that estimated for Year 1 after appraisal would
be as follows:

TANZANIA
SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Financial Institutions and Agricultural Credit
General
1.        Tanzanian lending institutions are wholly Government owned, the
banking system consisting of the Bank of Tanzania; two commercial banks, the
National Bank of Commerce and the Peoples Bank of Zanzibar; 1/ and two
development banks, the Tanzania Investment Bank and the Tanzania Rural
Development Bank. There is also a variety of financial institutions such
as the Tanganyika Development Finance Company Ltd., the National Insurance
Corporation, Permanent Housing Finance Company, Diamond Jubilee Investment
Co., and Investment Promotion Services. Since these entities, however, bear
no direct relation to the Project, they have not been covered in this
discussion.
The Bank of Tanzania
2.        The Bank of Tanzania was created by Act of Parliament in 1965 and
amended in 1971, to function as a central bank, issuing currency, regulating
banking and credit, acting as banker to the commercial banks and to Government,
and serving as fiscal advisor to Government. A Governor administers bank
operations in accordance with policy as prescribed by the Board of Directors,
which consists of the Governor, Chairman; the Director General, deputy
chairman; the Principal Secretary to the Treasury; and eight to ten directors.
The Governor and the Director General are appointed by the President of the
Republic, while the directors are appointed by the Minister of Finance.
The Governor and the Director General hold office for the period specified
in the instrument by which they are appointed, while the directors are
appointed for three-year terms.
3.        There are 10 departments in the bank -- Banking, Foreign, Exchange
Control, Import Control, Currency, Security, Accounts, Audit, Research and
Statistics, and Administration. The Banking Department provides a domestic
banking service to Government, maintaining its accounts and those of the
internal revenue offices throughout the country as well as; those of the two
commercial banks, while the Foreign Department has as one of its prime tasks
the preservation of Tanzania's foreign exchange position, and deals also
with investment and relations with international institutions. The Exchange
Control Department insures that rules and regulations regarding external
1/   This bank operates only in the island of Zanzibar.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
payments for imports and other remittances are observed, and the Import
Control Department regulates the flow of goods into tile country according
to available foreign exchange. The other departments perform support
services, as indicated by their names.
4.        The authorized (and paid-in) capital of the bank is Tsh 20 million,
while total assets on June 30, 1971 amounted to Tsh 1,300 million. The bank
realized a net profit of Tsh 42 million during 1970/71, which was Tsh 2
million higher than that achieved in the previous year, and credited it to
Government (Tsh 33 million) and to the General Reserve Fund (Tsh 9 million).
National Bank of Commerce
5.        The National Bank of Commerce (NBC) was created on February 7, 1967
by Act of Parliament to take over the banking business of a.ine foreign banks
after their nationalization, one of its main purposes being to mobilize
domestic savings. Lending operations extend into agriculture, industry,
construction, transport, trade, tourism, mining, and marketing, with loans
granted to both the private and the public sectors.
6.        NBC is governed by a Board of Directors, comprising a Chairman
and Managing Director, appointed by the President of the Republic, and Eive
to nine members, appointed by the Minister of Finance. A General Managers
appointed by the Board, is responsible to the Managing Director for day-to-day
operations of the nine headquarters departments and the 130 branches and
agencies that make up its countrywide network.
7.        NBC is in good financial condition.  Authorized capital is Tsih 175
million and paid-up capital amounts to Tsh 50 million. Total assets were over
Tsh 1,800 million as of June 30, 1971 and by the end of the year had risen to
more than Tsh 2,175 million. Net profits for the financial year 1970/71 were
Tsh 37 million as against Tsh 23 million in 1969/70. Funds for short-term
operations come mainly from public deposits, which reached about Tsh 1,600
million on June 30, 1971, with Tsh 1 million deposited in current accounts
and the balance in fixed and short-term deposits and in savings accounts.
Another source of funds, however, is the Bank of Tanzania, which can make
advances to NBC against the security of crop finance bills. These are
promissory notes executed by borrowers to the extent of the facilities
used. The Bank of Tanzania charges an interest rate of 5% per annum on
these advances.
13        Except for long-term loans to the Tanzania Investment Bank for
portfolio taken over, all loans are granted on short-term basis, usually up
to 180 days. NBC's financial support to agriculture and livestock at the end
of 1971 amounted to Tsh 81 million for production purposes (mainly seasonal
advances for planting and harvesting) and Tsh 397 million for marketing of
agricultural products. Under the Second Livestock Development Project, NBC
would provide short-term loans to the various parastatals involved. Rates of
interest vary in relation to the type of borrower and the purpose of the
loan - 6-1/2% to cooperatives; 7% to sisal growers and ranchers; 7% to 8%



ANNEX 5
Page 3
to parastatal organizations; 7-1/2% to 8-1/2% to exporters, industries, dad
agricultural enterprises (other than sisal producers); 8% to 9% to importers,
retail trademen, building contractors, and the like; 9% on secured personal
loans; and 10% on unsecured personal loans.
Tanzania Investment Bank
9.        The Tanzania Investment Bank (TIB) was established by an Act of
Parliament in October 1970 to specialize in the provision of medium- and long-
term credit for industrial development in such fields as manufacturing,
assembly, processing, engineering, construction, transportation, tourism,
and mining, as well as for development of large-scale corporate agriculture,
ranching, forestry, and fishing. TIB's other activities can be broadly
summarized under guarantee operations, equity participation, special
funds administration, trusteeship operations, and technical assistance.
10.       The Board of Directors consists of the Chairman and Managing Director,
who is the Principal Secretary to the Treasury, and six members.  The Chairman
and three directors are appointed by the President of the Republic, three
Directors are appointed by the Minister of Finance, two are appointed by the
National Bank of Commerce, and one by the National Insurance Corporation. A
General Manager, appointed by the Minister of Finance for a term of five years,
is in overall charge of the bank's four departments: Operation, Finance,
Economic Research, and Secretariat and Administration.
11.       The authorized share capital of TIB is Tsh 100 million, divided
equally into paid-up shares and callable shares. The paiLd-up capital of the
bank is Tsh 50 million, divided among Government, Tsh 30 million (60%7);
National Bank of Commerce, Tsh 15 million (30%); and National Insurance
Corp., Tsh 5 million (10%).  The value of the portfolio as of June 30, 1971
amounted to some Tsh 100 million, composed mainly of loans granted by the
National Bank of Commerce and transferred to TIB. Net profit on June 30, 1971
was Tsh 0.8 million. Interest charges are 9% per annum in long-term loans
and 9-1/2% per annum in short-term working capital loans.,
Tanzania Rural Development Bank
12.       Background.  The Tanzania Rural Development Bank (TRDB) was created
by the Tanzania Rural Development Bank Act, 1971, with the following
objectives: to provide long- and medium-term finance for rural development;
to provide technical assistance for the purpose of promoting rural develop-
ment; to administer such special funds as may from time to time be placed
at its disposal; to finance the purchase of agricultural inputs; to undertake
other activities as may be necessary for the purpose of furthering the fore-
going objectives. IDA approved the creation of TRDB through an amending
agreement (April 28, 1971).
13.       Several rural credit measures had been adopted by Government before
the passage of the TRDB Act. Among them were measures authorizing the
establishment of the Land Bank of Tanganyika (1947-1962), the Agricultural



ANhNEX 5
Page 4
Credit Agency (1962-1964), and the National Development Credit Agency
(1964-1971).
14.       TRDB inherited some assets and liabilities as well as certain
operations from the National Development Credit Agency (NDCA), including
IDA Credits 80-TA (US$5 million, general agricultural credit) and 217-TA
(US$6 million, flue-cured tobacco). Bad debts worth about Tsh 31 million
(US$4,350,000) were not transferred to TRDB. Nearly all of NDCA's staff
were absorbed into TRDB and most of them retained their previous assignments.
15.       Organization and Management.  TRDB is controlled by a board of
directors, including the chairman and managing director appointed by the
President of the Republic, and eight other members appointed by the M}inister
of Finance and chosen from among persons with knowledge and experience of
economic and financial matters, rural development, agriculture, ujamaa
villages, or cooperatives. The general manager, who is appointed by the
Minister of Finance for a term of five years, manages the bank through
its five departments and various committees. TRDB has one head office
in Dar es Salaam and 12 regional offices, which will be increased to 18
to cover every region in the country.
16.       There were four departments:  development, finance, administration,
and operation.  The posts of chief accountant and financial analyst have
been filled with expatriate officers, with IDA's approval, under Credits
80-TA and 217-TA. It is intended also that TRDB will receive up to six
UNDP-FAO technical experts, one for each aspect of rural development, in
support of TRDB's regional representatives. Local experts will replace the
UNDP-FAO team after a three-year training period.
17.       TRDB has an authorized capital of Tsh 100 million, divided into
100 equal shares, the Government being the sole authorized shareholder.
Issues paid in shares in February 1972 were Tsh 30 million, including Tsh 25
million tangible assets transferred from NDCA when TRDB came into operation
in May 1971, and Tsh 5 million paid by the Government in January 1972.
General reserves as of December 31, 1971, amounted to some Tsh 1.6 million,
including a surplus of about Tsh 1 million resulting from operations over
the period July-December 1971 (Table 1). Other TRDB resources comprise
short-term deposits of Tsh 6 million, IDA funds of Tsh 35 million and
Tsh 45 million (IDA Credits 80-TA and 217-TA, respectively), and National
Bank of Commerce's overdrafts for Tsh 3 million. TRDB also administers
a loan of Tsh 2.1 million from SIDA for grain stores and a loan of Tsh 8
million for the purchase of Swedish trucks. There is also a bank overdraft
of Tsh 7 million incurred by TRDB's predecessor for the purchase of tractors.
Negotiations are being conducted with Government for its liquidation, however,
as most of the loans are in default and TRDM has received verbal assurance
that Government will assume responsibility.
18.       TRDB also has authority to accept and administer special funds for
the purpose of making loans on concessionary terms (para 21).



ANNEX 5
Page 5
19.       Technical Services.  TRDB is committed to provide technical assist-
ance to borrowers. This job is performed by 12 regional representatives, all
of whom are graduates in either economics or agriculture, some having been
trained overseas. Seminars and short courses are included in the training
program, the first of which was conducted early this year in Dar es Salaam.
In addition, negotiations are underway to recruit six UNDP/FAO experts as
requested by Government. Three of them are expected to arrive this year
and the remainder in 1973.
20.       Lending Operations.  TRDB makes short- and medium-term loans up to
five years and long-term loans up to 15 years. Eligible borrowers are
cooperative unions and societies, district development corporations, ujamaa
villages and registered associations, corporations and individuals, and any
borrower whose needs fell within the scope of any agreement under which TRDB
has borrowed funds. Project loans should be technically and financially
viable and should be consistent with national economic development priorities.
TRDB secures its loans by either a first mortgage on imiovable property or a
chattel mortgage on movable property and values security at 75% of the
appraised value of the mortgaged property. TRDB does not undertake any
foreign exchange risk. Short term loans are generally rade at 8-1/2% interest
p.a. There is also an application fee of Tsh 5 to Tsh 500.
21.       Source of Funds.  TRDB has two main classes of loans -- those made
from ordinary funds and those made from special funds. Ordinary funds are
derived from the issuance of share capital, deposits, bank overdrafts, and
Government loans. Included in this category are IDA Credits 80-TA and
132-TA and loans from SIDA (Sweden) for grain storage facilities and trucks.
TRDB is also expected to receive special funds from Government or other
sources to grant loans on concessionary terms. These funds shall be recorded
and maintained separately from ordinary capital resources, nor shall profits
and losses between ordinary or special funds be chargeable to each other.
22.       Results of Operation and Financial Condition.  Total portfolio as
of February 29, 1972 has grown to over Tsh 102 million .as against only Tsh 71
million in May 1971. Recoveries from the old portfolio for the same period
amounted to some Tsh 43 million, principal and interest included. TRDB's
profit before taxation was Tsh 1 million on December 31, 1971.  While TRDB's
operating policies are satisfactory, accounts recently received indicate a
sharp rise in overdues - from Tsh 15.5 million as of May 1971 to Tsh 25.3
million as of September 1972. TRDB's loan portfolio increased by 63% during
this period and although overdues have remained constant (21% of total) the
provision for bad debts increased by 11% only from Tsh 11.4 million to Tsh
12.7 million. Accordingly, it would be a condition of credit effectiveness
that an analysis of such overdues and a statement of measures which TRDB
would take to reduce them to acceptable levels would first have been received
by IDA. In order to facilitate the strengthening of TRDB's financial position
and to enable it to build up reserves, IDA funds would be made available to
it at 4% annually, the rate applying under the first livestock project
and would on-lend to final beneficiaries at 8-1/2% annually (its current
lending rate) giving TRDB a margin of 4-1/2% annually. TRDB administers



ANNEX 5
Page 6
US$6.4 million under the Flue-Cured Tobacco Project. Another IDA credit for
tea development recently approved is channeled through TRDB. With the
implementation of these two projects and the proposed Second Livestock
Development Project, TRDB should be in a sound financial position.
23.       TRDB's accounting system is satisfactory.  Auditing is performed
by the Tanzania Audit Corporation (TAC), which already has audited its
balance sheet for the two-month period ended June 30, 1971. However, the
corresponding certificate and report were not yet available. TRDB would be
required to submit to IDA its audited annual accounts not later than six
months after the close of its financial year.
24.       Project Participation.  TRDB would act as the credit channel except
for the funds to Government for technical services and the Tsetse Control Unit.
It would channel funds for the following loan beneficiaries: ujanhaa coopera-
tives, DDC corporate ranches, Tanzania Livestock Marketing Company and
Tanzania Meat Processing Company, and National Agricultural Company (NACO).
25.       TRDB would receive the Project funds at 4% interest for a term of
16 years, with an eight-year grace period, and on-lend them at 8-1/2 interest
rate.
26.       In the case of all the ranches, TRDB's security would consist of
a lien over the livestock held on the ranch and the ranch itself until
outstanding loans are repaid. All animals would be branded with a ranch
brand. All livestock purchases and sales would have to bo approved by
TRDB. Wherever possible, loans would be repaid by a deduction of the sale
price of each animal brought to the marketing company and this would be
remitted directly to TRDB by this company.
27.       TRDB would hire, within six months of credit effectiveness, a
livestock credit expert for a minimum period of two years. Appointment to
this position would be made in consultation with IDA. TRDB is also expected
to hire not less than 10 local professionals capable of performing as live-
stock credit officers, all of whom would be engaged exclusively in Project
implementation. TRDB would conduct a training program for these officers.
28.       TRDB is also the channel for finance under the Agricultural Credit
Project (IDA Credit 80-TA), currently fully disbursed, and the Flue-Cured
Tobacco Project (IDA Credit 217-TA), US$547,000 disbursed (Feb. 28th, 1973),
a function which it took over from NDCA, with IDA's agreement. TRDB is also
the channel for the Smallholder Tea Development Project recently for US$10.8
million, with US$375,000 disbursed (Feb. 28th, 1973).
29.       Ex NDCA overdue loans as of February 1972 totaled Tsh 22 million,
or 30% of total outstanding loans. Since it is assumed that a substantial
part of this portfolio would be very difficult to collect and that part of it
would be uncollectible, it would be advisable for TRDB to create a special
section devoted exclusively to recovery operations. A thorough analysis of
this portfolio would also be conducted to define more accurately the estimated
percentage of funds susceptible of collection and the comparative cost to be
incurred by TRDB for this purpose.

TANZANIA
SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The National Agricultural Company Ltd. (NACO)
General
1.        The National Agricultural and Food Corporation (NAFCO) was established
in April 1969 under the Public Corporation Act of 1969 to promote agricultural
development and the production of food. It is governed by a board of directors,
whose Chairman is appointed by the Minister of Agriculture. The General Manager
is appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Mlinister of
Agriculture. The four operating departments are Planning, Finance, Operations
and Administration. However, it operates through several subsidiaries which
enjoy substantial autonomy, not only on day-to-day matters but also on major
policy items. One of its subsidiaries is the National Agricultural Company
Ltd. (NACO), a parastatal company, incorporated on tay 22, 1968 under the
Companies Ordinance of Tanzania. It has an authorized capital of Tsh 50
million divided into 50,000 ordinary shares fully subscribed and owned by
NAFCO. NACO is the implementing agency for IDA Credit 132-TA (Beef Ranching
Development Project).
2.        NACO's main objectives and functions are to:
Ca) purchase or otherwise acquire a right of occupancy over
lands and to sell, let or mortgage these lands;
(b) carry on the business of ranching and keeping cattle,
sheep, pigs, and other livestock and to sell, breed,
deal, and trade in stock, either live or dead;
(c) plant, grow, and deal in agricultural crops;
(d) issue and accept promissory notes and other negotiable
instruments and raise money in such manner as the
company shall think fit;
(e)  enter into arrangements with Government or other authori-
ties or companies or persons that may seem cornducive to
achievement of the company's objectives; and
(f) carry out such other operations as may be necessary to
further livestock and agricultural development.

Organization and MIanagement
3.        General policies and regulations are set for NACO by a board of
directors appointed by the National Agriculutral and Food Corporation (NAFCO).
This board is currently composed of the Director of Agriculture (Ministry of
Agriculture), Chairman; the General Manager of NAFCO; the General Manager
of the National Bank of Commerce; the General Manager of the Tanzania Sisal
Corporation, and the Commissioner of Lands.
4.        NACO's manager is appointed by the board of directors, with the
approval of the Minister of Agriculture. He is responsible for implementing
the development plans approved by the board and provides that body with
progress reports. During the disbursement period of IDA Credit 132-TA,
any appointment to that position would be subject to IDA approval.
5.        A Chief Development Officer advises NACO's manager on operation
and management of enterprises and planning and development, and his appoint-
ment is also currently subject to IDA approval, a requirement that would
remain in effect during the disbursement period of the proposed Project.
The Chief Veterinary Officer, responsible for establishing and implementing
veterinary procedures, is assisted by three veterinary officers, two of
whom operate on a zonal basis. Under IDA Credit 132-TA Project Agreement,
the appointment of the Chief Veterinary Officer is subject to IDA approval.
The Chief Accountant is responsible for the operation of a centralized
accounting service for all the ranches, for producing annual budgets, and
for operating a system of budgetary control.
6.        NACO's head office is in Dar es Salaam.  It has one field office
and 12 ranch-farm enterprises, five of which are currently financed through
IDA Credit 132-TA. NACO's organization is shown in Appendix 1.
Source of Funds
7.        NACO's financial resources are provided by NAFCO through equity
participation and/or through short- and long-term loans. Proceeds of IDA
Credit 132-TA are on-lent by NAFCO at 7% interest while NAFCO's own resources
are lent to NACO at 7-1/2% interest for short-term loans and 8% interest
for long-term loans. NACO also overdrafts from the National Bank of Commerce
at 7-1/2%.
Ranch-Farm Operations
8.        NACO's 12 ranch-farm enterprises have a total cattle herd of about
86,000 animals (as of June 1971), including a small number of dairy cows.
One of the enterprises is a sheep ranch and one is a pig unit. Five beef
cattle ranches are financed under IDA Credit 132-TA. The general policy as
directed from the head office is implemented by ranch managers, whose
technical knowledge has been increased through training. Four technical
ranch officers have recently been recruited from Australia to further
strengthen NACO's management.

Financial Condition
9.        Prior to May 1968, NACO was the agriculture department of the
National Development Corporation (NDC). It was incorporated with an authorized
capital of Tsh 50 million, total assets of Tsh 22 million, and paid-up capital
of Tsh 21 million. Accumulated losses grew to Tsh 5.7 mi:Llion (US$798,000)
at the end of 1971 as against only Tsh 0.3 million in 1968.
10.       Losses incurred by NACO can be attributed to several external and
internal factors. Among those not under NACO's control was the low fixed
meat price prevailing in Tanzania. Because of an acute meat shortage in
Dar es Salaam, NACO was forced in 1971 to sell steers before they were fed
out to higher weights. Severe drought conditions resulted in high cattle
mortality on one ranch and political problems with a neighboring country
led to cattle rustling and unexpected transfers of stock from one ranch to
another. Poor ranch management on two ranches and NACO's involvement in an
unprofitable dairy and mixed farm, as well as the delay in completing arrarige-
ments for the Zambia market, also contributed to the poor results. A sum-
mary of NACO's balance sheets for the last four years is shown in Table 1.
11.       Over the past few years, NACO's ranching operations have undergone
a transition period, with a rapid build-up in total stock number to about
80,000 head on the ranches financed under Credit 132-TA (para 8).  The
build-up in breeding cow numbers has been particularly si.gnificant and,
after 1972, feeder cattle will no longer have to be purchased for these
ranches. At present, livestock are undervalued by about Tsh 5.5 million on
NACO's books. The projected consolidated cash flow for NACO without and
with proposed development under the Project are detailed in Tables 2 and 3
and show that NACO's operations are profitable over the long term.
Performance Under the First Project
12.       IDA Credit 132-TA was declared effective on January 15, 1969
for US$1.3 million to cover 65% of a beef ranching development project, with
a total cost of US$2 million. Closing date is December 31, 1973. The
principal objectives of the Project are to increase the output of beef and
to expand the production of improved breeding stock in Tanzania. To accom.-
plish its aims, the Project would develop five cattle ranches and provide
technical services and a training program for ranch management.
13.       IDA funds are on-lent by Government to NAFCO at 4% and transferred
by NAFCO to NACO at 7% per annum for a term of 12 years, including a grace
period of five years.
14.       Disbursements of IDA funds to February 28, 1973 were on schedule
with a total of US$1.2 million, or 92% of total credit. Development on NACO's
ranches is close to schedule.

TANZANIA
SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Preparation of the Third Livestock Development Project
and Technical Services
Preparation of Third Livestock Development Project
1.        Responsibility for preparing the Third Livestock Development Project
would rest with the Ministry of Agriculture, whose planning unit would perform
the detailed work. At present, this unit is fairly well staffed and includes
an experienced agricultural economist seconded from FAO. It can also obtain
technical assistance from USAID and UNDP missions to Tanzania as well as from
experts within the Ministry, NACO and other parastatals. It is desirable,
however, that short-term foreign consultants also be engaged to assist in
preparation in specialized fields. The specialists required would be approxi-
mately as follows:
Livestock Production Specialist           2 man-months
Livestock Marketing Specialist            2 man-months
Economist with experience in meat
processing and marketing                2 man-months
Agronomist with experience in
maize and cereal crop production        2 man-months
Total          8 man-months
Total cost is estimated at about US$50,000 including subsistence, interna-
tional travel, and travel within Tanzania.
2.        The Third Project would continue development of the Livestock
sub-sector along lines established under the proposed Second Project, with
the main emphasis on increasing production through further expansion of
NACO, DDC, and ujamaa ranching operations. Preparation work would include:
(a) identification of suitable ranch development areas, herd
projections, investment costs, sales and oper-ating expense
projections, and financial viability;
(b)  evaluation of the relative merits of using these organizations
for future ranch development, both in terms of operating
efficiency and providing access to further development of the
traditional livestock sector:



ANNEX 8
Page 2
(c) exploration of cooperative development of beef ranching
in Masai land, since the proposed Second Project is
restricted to small ujamaa developments within
ranching associations;
(d) determination of the feasibility of developing mixed
enterprises such as maize production or pig and poultry
production based on maize produced on the ujamaa ranch
as well as the feasibility of reducing the slaughter
age of ranch-bred cattle by using improved pasture
and/or maize supplementation;
(e) evaluation of the marketing system financed under the
proposed Second Project, with emphasis on the adequacy
of existing facilities, the need for additional
facilities, and overall efficiency of the marketing
stock route/holding ground operations, and recommendations
for improvement when serious deficiencies exist;
(f) evaluation of the performance of the Tanzanian Meat
Processing Company, with special reference to the
efficiency of its operations and their effect on the
price paid for cattle to the producer. The need for
expanding existing facilities or constructing new
facilities should be specified and estimated. Attention
should also be focused on the product mix most suitable
for Tanzania, marketing requirements, and investment
required if changes are recommended.
Technical Services
3.        The technical services to be supported under the proposed Second
Project are outlined in the following table.

Financial Rate of Return
i,       The rates of return reported in Tables 1 and 2 are internal rates
of return on total investments. The financial returns on participant's
equity have not been computed since, for most ujamaa ranches, the return
on own equity is not likely to be a good indicator of financial incentive.
The same is true for the parastatal sector, which is essentially an
extension of the Government.
2.        A pre-development income level is assumed only for Kitulo, as
it is the only operation currently underway on a significant scale.
The other on-going ranches-Sumbawanga and Usangu--are in a very early
stage of development and the ujamaa ranches are new so it is assumed Lhat
a pre-development income level does not exist.  Because potential part_ciparts
are currently at the subsistence level, the effect of the investments is
therefore judged against that baseline. Additionally, a capitalized income
stream at 10% discount rate is used instead of the liquidation value of
the herd.
3.        The sales, cost, and investment estimates are derived from the
individual models and detailed assumptions are indicated in the different
models.

SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Economic Analysis
1.        The economic analysis is based on the following adjustment to the
financial analysis:
(a) Unskilled labor which accounts for about 30 petrcent of
operating costs, is valued at Tsh 77 per man nwnth, which
is the estimated per family income in the subsistence sector;
it compares to a market wage of Tsh 120 per mnrl month;
(b)  Foreign exchange costs and benefits are valued at Tsh 10
per US$; the official exchange rate is Tsh 7.14 per US$;
(c) Production is valued at international prices iadjusted for
transport cost; and
(d) Price contingencies are excluded from the cost estimates.
2.        Based on the assumptions, the economic rate of return was estimated
to be 35 percent; the calculations are given in Table 1 and basic data for
the Table is obtained from Annexes 3, 4, 6, 8 and 9. To test the sensitivity
of the rate of return to a number of variables, it was also estimated under
the following alternative assumptions:
Alternative                                   Rate of Return
(x)
(a)  Costs and benefits valued at market prices          14.2
(b)  Investment cost increased by 10%                    32
(c)  Investment cost increased by 20%                    30
(d)  Gross revenue decreased by 10%                      25
(e)  Unskilled labor valued at market prices             27
Table 2 gives the details of the sensitivity analysis.
