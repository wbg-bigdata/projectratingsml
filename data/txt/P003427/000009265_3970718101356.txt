REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A TECHNICAL COOPERATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the People's Republic of China to help finance a te-chnical coopera-
tion project. The credit, for SDR 9.4 million ($10 million equivalent), would
be on standard IDA terms.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An introductory economic report, entitled "China:  Socialist
Economic Development" (No. 3391-CHA), was distributed to the Executive
Directors on June 1, 1981. A country economic memorandum, entitled "China:
Recent Economic Trends and Policy Developments" (No. 4072-CHA), was
distributed to the Executive Directors on March 31, 1983. Basic data on the
economy are given in Annex 1.
Background
3.        Following a period of major institutional changes in the 1950s,
including land reform and the eventual establislatent of communes in rural
areas and the extension of public ownership to cover almost all of the modern
sector, development efforts in China have been directed toward the major
objectives of industrialization and poverty reduction.  Despite sharp oscil-
lations in policy and political upheavals like the 'reat Leap Forward
(1958-61) and the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), China has made substantial
progress toward achieving its objectives. Industrial growth since 1949 has
averaged more than 12Z p.a. (compared with under 5Z for agriculture); the
current share of industry in GDP (around 44Z) is similar to the average for
middle-income developing countries; and the country now produces a far greater
variety of industrial goods than most other developing countries.  Per capita
GNP (with adjustments for international comparability) grew at 2.5-3.0Z p.a.
in 1957-81, significantly above the average for other low-income developing
countries. In terms of basic education, nutrition and health the Chinese
population is much better off than its counterparts in other low-income
developing countries.
4.        However, China remains a very poor country, with a GNP per capita of
only $300 in 1982 and about 200 million people or 20Z of the population witb
unacceptably low incomes. The economy is also inefficient: past growth has
come mainly from massive mobilization of resources. For a country that faces
significant domestic resource constraints inefficiency is a particularly
serious problem.



-2-
5.        To address these problems and ensure rapid growth and improvements
in living standards, the Government initiated a program of reform and
adjustment in 1979. Economic reform, aimed at improving the efficiency of the
economic system, involves: (a) restoring and improving the quality of central
planning and policy coordination; (b) devolving more decision-making authority
to lower level units; (c) establishing more direct links between incomes and
the performance of economic units and individuals; and (d) relying more on
market mechanisms and economic instruments and less on administrative
directives, to influence economic activity. Structural adjustment, aimed at
speeding improvements in living standards, has involved readjusting the
relative shares of consumption and investment in national income, some
sectoral and subsectoral readjustments, and greater emphasis on foreign trade.
In 1981, problems with inflation and large budgetary and current account
deficits resulted in short-term stabilization temporarily receiving the
highest priority, but by 1982 the Government was again pushing ahead rapidly
with adjustment and reform.
Economic Reform
6.        Reforms have now affected all sectors of the economy and institu-
tions from the central government down to rural households. A major govern-
ment reorganization has strengthened the core planning and management agencies
(especially the State Planning Commission and the State Economic Commission)
and reduced the number of commissions, ministries and agencies under the State
Council from 98 to 52. Reorganization within ministries also has occurred,
while that of provincial and local governments is now underway. Economic
management has been decentralized: provincial and local authorities have been
given more autonomy in investment decision making and use of credit to finance
investment has increased; provincial and local governments have been granted
greater budgetary flexibility and more incentives to expand revenues and/or
economize on expenditures; and-ministries, new local trading companies and
some enterprises now have authority to engage directly in foreign_trade.
7.        Reforms have been most far reaching in rural areas, where introduc-
tion of various types of production responsibility systemw has given small
groups and households more autonomy in production and investment decisions and
linked incomes directly with output. By the end of 1982 92Z of production
teams in China had implemented such a system; 78% had implemnted a household
responsibility system, whereby collective ownership of farm land and major
equipment is maintained but plots of land are contracted out to individual
households, which can retain whatever they produce beyond their obligations to
the state and to the collective (which account for about one third of
production). The number and types of rural markets have also increased.
8.        Economic reform has not proceeded as far or as fast In urban areas,
but significant systemic changes have occurred. Reforms in the management of
state ente prises have aimed at improving incentives through profit retention
schemes and more flexible payment and employment practices. There have also
been experimental changes in the organization of state enterprises, a greater



- 3 -
variety of marketing channels, some price flexibility and adjustment of
relative prices, and greater autonomy for state enterprises in production
decisions. The scope for cooperative and individual economic activities has
also been enlarged.
9.        Many economic reforms, especially those in rural areas, have
already had a positive impact on efficiency, while others will take longer to
have a significant effect. There are also some emerging issues with economic
reform that the Government will need to address. In rural areas, there is a
potential conflict between enhanced economic incentives and equity in income
distribution, continued provision of basic services, and mobilization of
*         labor.  In the state enterprise sector, many units are still inclined to
overinvest and overproduce, since substantial decentralization of decision
making and control over resources has not been accompanied by necessary
reforms in the pricing system. More use is being made of the market, but
information and transport systems are still weak, markets are fragmented and
competition is limited. It has also been difficult to develop effective
indirect fiscal and monetary policy instruments.
Adjustment, Stabilization and Growth
10.       During the past four years, the Government has followed a strategy
of setting relatively modest targets while implementing economic and admin-
istrative measures that contribute to adjustment and stabilization as well as
to economic growth. The various measures have included: major increases in
agricultural procurement prices; strict controls on many other prices;
rationing and other administrative measures to improve efficiency of resource
use; cutbacks in state capital construction investment; fiscal measures to
limit the budget deficit; increases in interest rates; moderation of currency
and credit expansion; and the introduction of an internal settlement rate for
foreign exchange transactions and other measures to encourage exports and
economize on imports.
11.       These economic and administrative measures, combined with systemic
changes, have played an important role in the impressive performance of the
Chinese economy in recent years. Gross agricultural and industrial output at
constant prices grew by 7.3% per year between 1978 and 1982 - agriculture by
7.5% and industry by 7.2% (heavy industry by 3.4% and light industry by
11.8%). Net material product (NMP) at constant prices grew by an estimated
6.3% p.a. during the same period. Net investment has stagnated in real temns,
while material consumption grew by over 9% p.a. between 1978 and 1982.  The
share of investment in NM? was reduced from 36% in 1978 to 29% in 1982.
Domestic consumption of energy rose by less than 2% p.a. during 1978-82.
12.       Structural adjustment and rapid overall economic growth, combined
with a low population growth rate (1.3% p.a. between 1978 and 1982), have led
to rapid increases in per capita incomes. In urban areas, real per capita



- 4 -
incomes increased by 4.8% p.a. between 1978 and 1982; in rural areas the
real increase in per capita incomes was about 12X p.a. While more
prosperous areas and households may have benefitted the most and income
differentials at a local level may have increased, many poor areas and
households have also enjoyed substantial income improvements.
13.       The high rate of investment in 1978 and the low returns to much
of this investment made a cutback in the investment rate a priority for the
adjustment program. But achieving such a cutback has proved difficult.
Decentralization of investment decision making has permitted a rapid growth
in investment financed from retained earnings or local resources. As a
result, most of the cutbacks in investment have been in large centrally
financed projects (in 1981 even the priority sectors of energy and
transportation were affected), though some of these were revived in 1982.
14.       Government policy measures have helped restore domestic economic
stability by lowering the rate of inflation from 6% in 1980 to 2.4% in 1981
and 2% in 1982, and by reducing the budget deficit (adjusted to eliminate
financing items) from 7% of NMP in 1979 and 5X in 1980 to less than 2% in
1981 and 1982. The restoration of fiscal stability was achieved mainly by
sharp cuts ia expenditures on investment. Subsidies (mainly on daily living
necessities) rose dramatically from about 7% of total expenditures in 1978
to 26% in 1982, whea they were 9% of NMP.
15.       China's external position has also changed greatly in recent
years; the current account deficit of $2.4 billion in 1980 was converted
into a $2.0 billion surplus in 1981 and an estimated $6.4 billion surplus in
1982, an improvement far greater than anticipated. The real growth of
merchandise exports has been very impressive, averaging over 15% p.a. during
1978-82, mainly because of a rapid growth in manufactured exports. The
growth rate has been declining steadily, however. Meanwhile the volume of
imports declined in both 1981 and 1982, due in part to the lagged effect of
contract cancellations and suspensions, but also to delays in equipment
deliveries and to problems in obtaining high technology goods. A
substantial increase in Imports is expected in 1983 and 1984 as China
expands its investment program and imports more mach!nery and equipment.
16.       A major consequence of the Government's conservative balance of
payments strategy has been reduced foreign borrowing. In 1980 and 1981 the
Government cut back sharply on interbank borrowing and in 1981 and 1982 took
advantage of the unexpectedly strong current account position to repay
commercial bank and other loans. In 1981 China's debt service ratio was
7.8%, due in part to accelerated loan repayments. At the end of 1981 total
reserves (excluding gold) were $5 billion; by the end of 1982 they had
increased to over $11 billion (equivalent to about seven months of 1982
imports).



-5-
Medium-Term Prospects
17.       During the remainder of the 1980s, the Government's efforts to
improve living standards should be helped considerably by continuation of a
relatively low population growth rate; by opportunities to make greater and
more efficient use of foreign technology and capital; and by the possibilities
for improving efficiency through economic reform. Rapid and equitable econ-
omic development is constrained by a number of factors, however. There are
serious shortages of skilled manpower (current enrollment in universities and
technical and vocational schools is one quarter of the average rate for other
developing countries). With limited possibilities for expanding the
cultivated area and with cropping intensities and yields already quite high,
the growth rate for agriculture is unlikely to average more than 3-4Z p.a.
during the 1980s.  Energy availability will continue to constrain industrial
growth, and there are capacity constraints in the transport and commercial
sectors. Large investments will-be required in energy and transport at a time
when competing demands from other sectors, especially housing, are very great,
domestic revenues have not been growing rapidly, and decentralization has
weakened government control over investment.
18.       In recognition of these difficulties, the Government's Sixth Five-
Year Plan (published in December 1982 but covering the period January 1981 -
December 1985) emphasizes continuation of the program of "adjustment, reform,
consolidation and improvement of the national economy." The plan period is
essentially viewed as an interim period during which the foundation will be
laid for more rapid economic development under subsequent plans. Modest
targets are set for production and income growth (4% p.a. for gross agricul-
tural and industrial output and for NlMP), consumption is expected to grow
faster than investment, prices will be kept basically stable, the budget
deficit will be kept low, and a significant expansion in foreign trade is
forecast, with imports growing more rapidly than exports. Priority will be
given to measures improving efficiency rather than maximization of output, but
the Government expects most production targets to be surpassed, as they have
been in the first two years of tie Sixth Plan.
19.       Reform implementation will be speeded up during the next three
years. Rural reforms will be broadened and strengthened, with the production
responsibility system extended to new spheres of activity, new types of orga-
nization (including joint ventures between rural and urban units) encouraged,
and the administrative functions of communes separated from their economic
functions.  In state-owned industry, taxation will replace profit remittance
as the primary means of raising government revenue, industrial administration
will be streamlined, and more inefficient enterprises will be closed down.
The commercial system will be reformed and cooperative and individual
commerce, particularly in rural areas, will be promoted. In investment
planning, the Government is striving for more effective implementation of
existing administrative regulations, but improving the structure and
efficiency of investment will be a long and difficult process, dependent very
much on progress on other aspects of reform. Measures to introduce formal



- 6 -
economic analysis (including use of shadow prices) into investment decisions
and to make producing units more economically and financially responslble for
their decisions through appropriate pricing and incentive schemes are
especially important. Price reform itself is recognized as being crucial, but
in view of the complexities and magnitude of the changes required, the
Government has decided that it cannot implement comprehensive price reform
until after 1985. However, appropriate upward or downward adjustments in the
most distorted prices are being made, and the prices of many minor commodities
are being allowed to fluctuate according to market conditions.
20.       During the remainder of the 1980s, China's development and moderni-
zation programs are expected to result in rapid growth of imports of capital
and intermediate goods. By the late 1980s, some imports of energy are also
likely to be necessary before new domestic energy production capacity is
established. China's temporary current account surpluses are expected to
change quickly to moderate deficits. But the overall rate of import expan-
sion, the size of the current account deficit, and the magnitude of foreign
borrowing requirements are very sensitive to assumptions about economic trends
and the effectiveness of government programs. For example, even a slight
acceleration of economic growth without significant improvements in effi-
ciency, especially energy efficiency, could result in large current account
deficits and debt management difficulties by the end of the 1980s. In fact, a
relatively high rate of economic growth of 6-7% p.a. during the rest of the
1980s (which is the growth rate used in the projections in Annex 1) will
probably be feasible only if major improvements in energy efficiency continue.
21.       China-s access to concessionary capital to finance its development
and modernization program is limited: apart from Bank Group funds, a signi-
ficant amount of concessionary capital is likely to come only from Japan and a
few other bilateral donors and will probably average only $500-600 million a
year during the 1980s. If China is to maintain a reasonable growth rate and
manageable debt service payments, it will need to obtain the necessary foreign
capital at an average interest rate below the market rate. China also has a
strong claim to concessionary lending because it is still one of the poorer
countries in the world.
22.       For China, as for many other developing countries, the 1980s will
be a difficult decade. But looking further ahead, China-s economic prospects
appear favorable. By 1990, most new entrants into the labor force will have
received some secondary education, and the skilled manpower deficit will have
been reduced. Further progress will have been made in tapping China's large
energy potential and in using it more efficiently. Continuation of recent
manufactured export trends should generate additional foreign exchange,
enabling the Government to use foreign capital more freely and be less
concerned about its terms. If the country's immense wealth of human talent,
effort and discipline can be combined with policies that increase the
efficiency of resource use, China will be able to achieve continuing
substantial increases in the living standards of its people. Whether this
potential can be realized, however, will depend crucially on the success of
the Government's program of reform and adjustment in the 1980s.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CHINA
23.       In view of the particular circumstances of China and the economic
transition now underway, the Bank's relationship with China should have
several broad objectives. Firstly, the Bank should offer China its consider-
able development experience and institutional knowledge. Moreover, working
with the Bank represents one means for China to re-establish its position in
the world community after its lengthy isolation. Secondly, the Bank should
assist China in removing the major constraints on development - the shortages
of energy, transport infrastructure, skilled manpower and modern technology.
Even more important, the Bank should help the authorities to use these and
other inputs more efficiently, by improving project analysis and investment
control, as well as overall economic management and planning. Finally, the
Bank should help the Government identify ways of reducing China's remaining
poverty. Since the Government htas been successful in meeting the basic needs
of most of its people, these efforts should concentrate on the poorest rural
areas.
24.       Since China's change of representation in the Bank Group in May
1980, eight projects involving lending of about $870 million have been
approved. Two have been in education (University Development and Agricultural
Education and Research), two in energy (Daqing Oilfield Gaotaizi Reservoir
Development and Zhongyuan-Wenliu Petroleum), two in agriculture (North China
Plain and Heilongjiang Land Reclamation), one in transport (Three Ports),
and one in industry (Industrial Credit). Annex II contains a summary
statement on these loans and credits, as well as notes on the execution of
ongoing projects, as of March 31, 1983.
Economic and Sector Work
25.       The Bank's economic and sector work was initially designed to pro-
vide a basis of knowledge on the development and functioning of the Chinese
economy. This work resulted in completion of a nine-volume introductory
economic report in June 1981. A follow-up country economic memorandum
(Report No. 4072-CIA) analyzing developments over the past two years was
distributed to the Executive Directors on March 31, 1983. In addition, the
Bank has undertaken studies in several areas important for our understanding
of the Chinese system, includirm rural finance and urban planning and
management in Shanghai.
26.       Other economic work is designed to assist China in its present
effort to promote efficient use of investment resources, and more generally
to introduce new methods of economic management and planning. As preparation
for the Industrial Credit Project, an appraisal manual has been developed
with Bank assistance by the new financial intermediary, the China Investment
Bank. The Bank is now helping to develop a similar manual for the
Agricultural Bank of China. A program of economic research on China's



-8-
development problems, aimed at the application of advanced analytical
techniques, has begun in collaboration with Chinese economic research insti-
tutions in the areas of enterprise incentives and analysis of structural
change.
27.       Sector studies will help inter alia to identify and prepare future
investments. Some have been included in Bank Group-financed projects, e.g.,
agricultural development in Shandong Province under the North China Plain
Project, containerization under the Three Ports Project, and agricultural
manpower and research under the agricultural Education and Research Project.
A health sector review is reporting on rural health care delivery systems
and health manpower development.                                                           e
Near-Term Lending
28.       Work has begun on a range of projects, with emphasis on improved
management and efficiency as well as on technical assistance and training.
Several are in the key sectors of energy and transportation. In energy, the
Bank's efforts will help to increase the supply of fuel and power. Future
petroleum projects will, like the first two, emphasize the introduction of
modern technology, staff training and studies. Other operations will support
hydropower generation in southwest China and the development and management
of large underground coal mines in Shanxi province. In transportation, the
Bank will finance a railway project to help transport coal from mines in
Shanxi to the east coast, and may finance further projects in railways and
in ports where additional capacity is needed.
29.       In view of China's shortages of manpower with higher or technical
education, the Bank will continue its support of education, through the pro-
posed polytechnic and TV university project, a second agricultural education
project, and another university development project. Support of agriculture
will continue through a project to develop rubber cultivation in Guangdong
Province, as well as others to provide rural credit in two provinces with
emphasis on improved project appraisal and institutionbuilding, provide
further assistance in agricultural research, and assist the Government in
forestry. In industry, further loans will be made to the China Investment
Bank mainly for modernization of light industries and export projects, and
there will be projects for technical renovation and modernization in
industries such as fertilizers and machine tools. In health, a project will
help improve rural health care services and medical education. Bank
assistance is also planned for a water supply project.

PART III - TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
Scope of Technical Assistance Need.
30.       China's isolation and limited access to the innovation and
technological advance occurring elsewhere in the world during much of the
past 30 years constitutes a major stumbling block to the achievement of more
rapid progress today. Many of the changes now underway (see Part I) are
linked to the objective of establishing conditions under which China cpn
become a technologically progressive and dynamic economy. Most reforms can
be expected to bear fruit in a relatively long run context (for example, the
expansion and reform of the system of higher education); in the interim
however, the Government is seizing opportunities to inject modern technology
in key sectors of the economy through its massive investment program. The
focus for much of this effort is an expanding network of joint agreements
and technical cooperation with the international private sector (as for
example, in offshore petroleum); another part involves Investment-linked
advisory services and technical assistance through government-to-government
cooperation and in association with multi-lateral agencies, including the
Bank Group. The proposed project would contribute to this effort, in
particular, by providing a source of funds for studies and other services
related to the expanding program of Bank Group lending.
IDA's Role and Strategy
31.       Early Bank Group experience, in project work carried out over the
past three years, confirms the important role of technical assistance in the
design and preparation of projects, even though the bulk of the work is
carried out by government officials and agencies.
32.       In addition to the direct role of Bank Group staff in project
preparation and appraisal, considerable support for these early projects has
been obtained from the UNDP. The Bank has been the Executing Agency for two
UNDP-financed projects which have had the specific objective of preparation
of investment projects to be financed by the Bank Group. UNDP has allocated
$1.8 million for this purpose, $1.4 million under an Umbrella Project and
$400,000 for preparation of a proposed first coal project. The Umbrplla
Project has financed inputs required in connection with preparation _ each
of the first eight projects approved by the Bank Group, and is financing
inputs for several other proposed projects.  Typical Umbrella Project
subprojects include major inputs into feasibility studies, assistance with
preparation of bidding documents, study tours and other training. A list
of subprojects financed under the Umbrella Project is attached as Annex IV.
Bilateral grants have also been drawn upon to help finance project
preparation activities. Australia made an initial grant of approximately
$380,000 equivalent in 1982 for preparation of a proposed first hydropower
project, and Germany has approved assistance worth approximately $400,000
equivalent for further preparation of a proposed first coal project. The



- 10 -
Government has also begun to make increasing use of piggybacking, i.e., the
inclusion of funds in one Bank Group-financed project for the preparation of
subsequent projects involving the same ministry in the same sector.
33.       The Government intends to continue to utilize grant financing from
UNDP and bilateral sources for project preparation when it is available.
However, UNDP's allocation to China is limited and there are many compet-
ing demands on it. Bilateral financing will continue to be utilized in
certain cases. For example, Australia has agreed to provide grant financing
totalling $3.7 uill!on for additional assistance for preparation of the
proposed hydropower pLoject referred to above, for urban transport, housing
and sanitation studia- in Shanghai, and for the preparatiou of a future                  9
coal project. Other possibilities for bilateral financing will be pursued
actively, e.g., through rhe Government-s technical assistance agreements
with Canada and Germany. Piggybacking will also be increased.
34.       The Government thus intends to continue to make use of the mechan-
isms described above to finance project preparation activities. However,
they are expected to be far from sufficient to meet the full needs of the
ex-anding Bank Group lending program to China. The proposed IDA technical
cooperation credit would fill the need for an assured and flexible means of
financing project preparation when grant financing is unevailable.  The
credit would also finance other categories of technical assistance in
appropriate cases (see para. 37).
Administration of Technical Assistance
35.       The three main organizations dealing with the administration of
technical assistance in China are the State Planning Commission, the
Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and
Trade. The State Planning Commission is responsible for ensuring that
proposals for technical assistance are in accordance with the national
development plan. The Ministry of Finance must ensure the availability of
counterpart financing for each project and acts as the coordinating author-
ity for Bank activities in China, including techrical assistance. The
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Tradle is the government coordinr-
ating authority for United Nations and most bilateral technical cooperation.
In addition to the overall coordination and supervision functions exercised
by these bodies, the relevant line ministry or agency is responsible for
initiating requests for specific technical assistance, providing counterpart
support and technical supervision, and utilizing the results.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project Formulation and Preparation
36.       The Bank Group has been discussing the possibility of an IDA
credit for technical assistance with the Government for the past year and a
half because of the need to supplement existing sources of technical assist-
ance for preparation of the expanding program in China. Appraisal cf the
project took place in March 1983. Negotiations for the proposed credit were
held in Washington, D.C. in July, 1983. The Government was represented by a
delegation led by Mr. Luc Qing, Deputy Director of the External Finance
Department, Ministry of Finance. Attached as Annex III is a supplementary
project data sheet.
Project Objectives and Description
37.       The principal objective of the project is to provide an assured
and flexible source of financing (line of credit) for technical assistance
for the preparation of projects proposed or expected to be proposed for
fi-xancing by the Bank Group, in cases where other preparation financing is
not readily available on equally suitable terms and where IDA financing
would permit more expeditious action. The project also provides for financ-
ing of technical assistance for the preparation of other investment pro-
jects, in exceptional cases. Further objectives are to strengthen the
government-s capacity to select, prepare and implement projects and to
administer technical assistance. It is expected that limited technical
assistance required for the implementation of projects already being
financed by the Bank Group, and instit-:Lion building assistance to agencies
involved with Bank Group operations, would also be financed. In addition,
the credit would finance limited amounts of equipment required for
implementation of the technical assistance provided.
38.       The proposed project would finance approximately 20-25 subprojects
involving high priority technical assistance needs. Individual subprojects,
their method of implementation and allocatioas from the credit would be
agreed between the Government and the Association on a case-by-case basis.
The subprojects would be of high priority in the Government-s economic
development plan and consistent with the Bank C oup-s lending strategy in
the country during the next few years, and would have no other equally
suitable source of external financing (Development Credit Agreement, Section
3.01 and Schedule 1). Virtually all sectors where the Bank Group is
involved in lending are expected to benefit. The pipeline of potential
suSprojects under consideration for financing under the proposed project is
given in Annex V. At negotiations, preliminary agreement was reached on
some 16 initial subprojects, cvering the first six to twelve months of
project implementation.



- 12 -
39.       Subprojects or activities likely to be .inanced from the credit
include major inputs into large feasibility studies, assistance with or
review of other feasibility and prefeasibility studies, smaller amounts for
other preparation work such as expert panels, individual specialists, and
study tour<, limited related equipment and other activities whose objective
is to strengthen institutions responsible for project planning and implemen-
tation. Technical assistance required during the implementation of projects
already being financed by the Bank Group, such as advisory services (where
these are not include4 in the project loan or credit) would also be eligible
in exceptional cases, primarily where the aeed for such technical assistance
was not foreseen at the outset.
40.       While the principal objective of this first techaical cooperation
credit is to finance technical assistance for specific projects, an effort
would be made to strengthen the Government-s ability both to administer
technical assistance and to prepare projects. Certain steps have already
been taken. In June 1982 the Bank gave a three-day seminar in Beijing on
consultiag services for the central coordinating authorities as well as line
ministries and China-s recently established consulting firms. The appraisal
mission for the project devoted substantial time to the mechanics of techni-
cal cooperation, using the Association-s experience with technical assist-
ance projects in Bangladesh as a case study. During negotiations the
Association conducted a seminar on technical assistance utilizing its
recently developed audio-visual program on procedures for the contracting of
consultants. It also provided the proposed project coordinator within the
Ministry of Finance (see para. &2) with a week of training in technical
assistance administration at Association headquarters at the conclusion of
negotiations. Finally, arrangements have been set in motion for the three
most closely involved Ministry of Finance officials to visit Bangladesh and
Pakistan to review those countries- considerable experience with technical
assistance projects financed by the Bank Group.
41.       To strengthen China-s ability to prepare projects, an effort would
be made to ensure that consultants- terms of reference include appropriate
provision for training of counterpart staff. If the line ministry agrees,
additional man-months would be included in consultants- contracts specifi-
cally for training. Also, in certain cases it may be desirable to have
local and foreign consultants work in combination on specif'c assignments to
facilitate the transfer of technology. Because of the importance of the
terms of reference to the success of consulting assignments, IDA would
review and approve all terms of reference (Development Credit Agreement,
Section 3.05(a)).
Organization and Implementation
42.       The External Finance Department of the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
would have responsibility for overall coordination and subproject processing
for the Government (Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.04 (b) (i)).
MOF would consult with the State Planning Commission concerning the status



- 13 -
of the investment project which the technical cooperation credit (TCC)
subproject would support. It would consult with the Ministry of Foreign
Economic Relations and Trade concerning the availability of UNDP and
bilateral grant financing for the proposed subproject. The MOF is making
the necessary internal arrangements to coordinate and to administer the TCC;
it would designate a suitably qualified officer of the External Finance
Department to serve as project coordinator until the Closing Date, to be
assisted by other competent staff in adequate numbers as required
(Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.04 (b) (ii)). The Ministry has
identified a suitably qualified official as the proposed coordinator and his
formal designation is expected shortly; he was a member of the Chinese
E       negotiating team.  As mentioned above (para. 40) the Association is
assisting MOF with the training of the proposed coordinator and his staff.
Designation of the coordinator would be a condition of effectiveness
(Development Credit Agreement, Section 5.01(b)). The MOF also intends to
provide the coordinator with an assistant familiar with Bank Group
operations in China.
43.       Line ministries would present requests for TCC financing to MOF.
These requests are expected to originate mostly during discussions between
Bank Group project staff and line ministry staff during the course of
missions. MOF would review the proposals on a case by case basis and those
the Government supports would be forwarded to the Association for approval.
The line ministry would handle all technical aspects of the subprojects, and
would contract consultants, arrange study tours and other training, an'
procure equipment. MDF would provide administrative assistance on a
case-by-case basis. It plans to draw up shortly guidelines for the
processing, implementation and supervision of subprojects, and intends to
provide the guidelines to the Association for review prior to finalization;
points to be covered were discussed during negotiations. 14DF would maintain
records on the status of each subproject including the elapsed time between
various steps in subproject processing and the contracting of consultants.
The Government would establish procedures satisfactory to the Association
for supervising the work of consultants and reviewing their reports and
recommendations (Development Credit Agreements Section 3.04(c)).  IDA would
have the right to terminate withdrawals--for a particular subproject in case
of a delay exceeding six months in effectiveness of the related consultants'
contract (Development Credit Agreement. Section 4.01(b)).
Project Cost and Financing
44.       The proposed project would cover a two-year commitment period
(FY84-85), while the Closing Date for disbursements would be December 31,
1987. The total project cost is estimated to be $12 million, including
taxes and duties with a foreign exchange cost of $9 million. The proposed
IDA credit would be SDR 9.4 million ($10 million equivalent) and would
finance the full foreign exchange costs, as well as a portion of local
costs in appropriate cases (para. 47). The Goverrment would finance the
remaining $2 million of local costs. No allowance has been made for
r,hysical and price contingencies as the project is essentially a line of



- 14 -
credit to help finarae a program defined in financial terms and for which the
specific requirements are not yet known precisely. Based on consultants-
rates under the UNDP Umbrella Project and estimates for consultants to be
financed from initial Bank Group supported projects, it is estimated that
the consultant rates under the proposed project would average about $10,000
per man-month (including travel and subsistence).
45.       The proposed credit amount is based on an estimate of the technical
assistance requirements for project preparation during FY84-85. This would
include any remaining technical assistance required to prepare the projects
expected to be brought forward for Board consideration in FY84, technical
assistance requirements of projects in the pipeline for FY85-86, and the
initial requirements of projects programmed after FY86, i.e., technical
assistance expected to be needed before the close of FY85 'or such projects.
The MOF would make credit funds available to line ministries as grants,
except that whenever an investment project resulted, the funds would be
repaid to the MOF on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Asociation
(Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.08). An understanding was reached
that repayment would take place in the first year after the grace period of
any loan made for the investment project, which is acceptable.
Procurement and Disbursements
46.       Consultant services to be financed from the proposed credit would
be contracted in accordance with the Bank-s Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants. Equipment to be financed from the credit would be limited and
the cost of most individual items is expected to be small. Procurement of
items and groups of items estimated to cost $100,000 or more in each contract
(if any) would be through international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Guidelines for Procurement under World Bank loans and IDA credits.
Domestic manufactur.-rs would receive a preference of 15% or the applicable
customs duty, whichever is less, in bid evaluation. Items and groups of
items estimated to cost less than $100,000 in each contract and not
exceeding an aggi-egate amount of $500,000 may be procured an the basis of
quotations from at least three qualified suppliers. Prior Association
review would be required of contracts for equipment items estimated to cost
$100,000 or more (Development Credit Agreement Schedule 2).
47.       It is estimated that about 70% of the credit would finance consul-
taut services and about 30% would finance study tours, other training and
equipment. The Association would finance Ci) 100% of foreign expenditures
for consultant services: (ii) 100% of foreign expenditures for overseas
study to'rs and other training; (iii) for equipment, 100% of foreign expend-
itures, 100% of local ex-factory costs and 75% of local expenditures for
imported items procured locally. The Government will normally meet the
costs of local consultants. However, to facilitate the transfer of
technology, an understanding was reached that the Association would, if
requested, finance 100% of local expenditures in cases where the local
consultants work in combination with foreign consultants.



- 15 -
48.       The Government-s contribution to individual subprojects would
normally consist of counterpart staff, local consultants, office space,
supplies, secretarial services, vehicle operation. It is expected to total
about 17% of the cost of each subproject.
Monitoring and Evaluation
49.       The Ministry of Finance would be responsible for monitoring the
project and would collect, review and evaluate information regarding
individual subprojects. Semi-annual progress reports would be forwarded to
the Association (Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.06(b)). The line
*       ministries would be responsible for monitoring the progress of individual
subprojects. Project-related accounts would be audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Association and the audit report provided to the
Association within six months of the end of each fiscal year (Development
Credit Agreement, Section 3.07(b)). The State Audit Agency now in process
of establishment may be in a position to undertake the relatively simple
audit that will be required for this project.
Benefits and Risks
50.       The major benefit of the proposed project would be the development
of a pipeline of projects intended and suitable for financing by the Bank
and/or the Association. The project would also strengthen other institu-
tions which support the development and implementation of investment
projects. A longer run benefit would be the strengthening of the Govern-
ment-s capability to prepare projects. It is expected that the domestic
consulting industry would also be strengthened through working with foreign
consultants, thus reducing dependence on expatriate consultants and advisers
for preparation of repeater projects.
51.       There are no major risks in the implementation of the proposed
project. There is some risk that implementation could proceed more slowly
than projected. This is due in part to the borrower's relative inexperience
with management and supervision of foreign technical assistance. To
minimize this risk, training has been and would be provided for Ministry of
Finance staff and the Association would monitor the project closely.
52.       Because of the nature of the project, and the fact that it is the
first one of its type in China, it would require close supervision and
advice and a heavier than usual allocation of IDA staff time.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the People's
Republic of China and the Association, and the Recommendation of the
Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of
Agreement of the Association, are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
54.       Additional conditions of effectiveness of the proposed credit
would be that: (a) China's State Council shall have approved the
Development Credit Agreement; and (b) A project coordinator shall have been
designated (Development Credit Agreement, Section 5.01).
55.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III.
56.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
57.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
