MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR THE NORTHEAST IRRIGATION I PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan for
US$210.0 million equivalent to the Federative Republic of Brazil is submitted
for approval. The proposed loan would be repayable in 15 years, including 5
years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.  It would help to
finance six irrigation subprojects in Northeast Brazil.
2.       Background.  Prior to 1980, agricultural production growth in Brazil
was led by the growth of non-traditional exports (mainly soybeans and citrus).
Production increases came almost entirely from area expansion as opposed to
increases in yields. Production was particularly dynamic in the expanding
frontier states of the Center-West and parts of Minas Gerais. In the early
1980s, agricultural growth slowed, and the expansion of the agricultural
frontier came to a virtual halt, with the exception of some areas in the North.
In the last couple of years, agricultural growth has resumed, due, in part, to
significant yield increases brought about, in large measure, by a successful
agricultural research program and an expansion of irrigated areas. By 1987,
agriculture accounted for about 102 of GDP. Its share in the labor force and
total exports were 252 and 43Z, respectively.
3.       The Executive Secretariat for the National Irrigation Program (SEPRONI)
in the Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) manages the National Irrigation Program
(PRONI) and coordinates the federal executing agencies for irrigation--the Sao
Francisco Valley Development Company (CODEVASF), the National Department for
Anti-Drought Works (DNOCS), and the National Department of Sanitation (DNOS).
In 1970, the country's total irrigated area was only 0.5 million ha. Today, it
is over 2.2 million ha, including an estimated 440,000 ha of irrigated farm land
in the Northeast of Brazil. About 92,000 ha have been developed under public
irrigation schemes managed by CODEVASF, DNOCS, and DNOS. With limited
exceptions, including two Bank-financed projects, the Sao Francisco I (Loan
1153-BR) and Sao Francisco II Projects (Loan 1729-BR), most public irrigation
development has fallen far short of expectations. Major difficulties have
included a lack of well-defined objectives and strategies; insufficient planning
and analysis of financial and economic viability; inadequate institutional
arrangements which relied heavily on public sector agencies; and funding
constraints. In order to address these difficulties, the Government has
reoriented its strategy for irrigation towards increased participation of the
private sector, including the beneficiaries themselves. A Bank Irrigation
Subsector Review, dated June 22, 1989, based on the findings and conclusions of
a Government review carried out in 1988, proposes a medium-term irrigation
investment strategy and provides guidance on priorities, the role of the
Government and the necessary subsector policy reforms. With regard to future
public irrigation projects in the Northeast, the Subsector Review recommends
that: (a) future schemes should be economically viable and production-oriented;
(b) operation and maintenance costs and public investments in off-farm
irrigation infrastructure should be recovered from beneficiaries through water
charges; (c) most future irrigation development should be demand-driven, with



-2-
maximum participation of the private sector and the beneficiaries. The present
project forms part of the National Irrigation Program outlined in the subsector
review and follow its recommendations.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's assistance strategy for
Brazil is to support policies and investments that will encourage economic
growth and social development in a context of macro-economic stability with
emphasis on efficient resource allocation in the public sector and appropriate
targeting and delivery of support systems to the poor. Irrigation development,
because of its ability to intensify use of agricultural lands and to increase
production and productivity, is potentially one of the most cost-effective
strategies for achieving sector efficiency and growth. The Bank, through its
support for selected interventions, including the Northeast Irrigation
Engineering Project (Loan 2680-BR), the Upper and Middle Sao Francisco
Irrigation Project (Loan 2718-BR), the Irrigation Subsector Project
(Loan 2950-BR) and the Jaiba Irrigation Project (Loan 3013-BR), as well as
through its sectcr work, including the Irrigation Subsector Review, is assisting
the Government in formulating and implementing new policies and operational
strategies for a more efficient and rapid subsector development. In particular,
the Northeast Irrigation Engineering Project is aimed at improving project
planning and analysis and includes the preparation of a number of special
studies, related to such topics as cost recovery and operation and maintenance,
and the preparation of feasibility studies and detailed designs for some of the
most potentially promising irrigation projects in the Northeast. Through its
support for the proposed project, the Bank would continue this work by assisting
the Government in financing the construction and initial operation of six of the
medium-size irrigation schemes prepared by the Government, with assistance from
private consulting firms and the US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), under the
Engineering Project. It would also be supporting the implementation of key
policy and institutional reforms with respect to public irrigation on a
relatively broad scale. These reforms include improved sector planning and
monitoring capabilities and the establishment of private irrigation districts to
operate and maintain the irrigation schemes. Finally, since the proposed
project would generate increased economic activity and employment opportunities
in rural areas of the country's poorest region, the Bank would be assisting
Goverment efforts to alleviate poverty in the Northeast.
5.       Proiect Objectives.  The main objective of the project is to increase
agricultural production in the drought-prone area of the Brazilian Northeast,
through irrigatior development of some 51,000 ha. In addition, the project aims
at strengthening institutional arrangements for irrigation development by
promoting increased farmer involvement through the creation of private
irrigation districts Rnd by improving public agency performance.
6.       Project Description.  The project would consist oft (a) construction of
six new irrigation schemes in the States of Ceara, Piaui, and Bahia; (841 of
baseline costs); (b) establishment of and initial operational support for six
irrigation districts responsible for environmental protection measures,
operation and maintenance of irrigation and drainage works, and agriculture
extension, training and marketing services (72 of baseline costs); and
(c) provision of technical assistance for PRONI, and to DNOCS, and consultant
services for construction supervision to CODEVASP, DNOCS and DNOS, the executing
agencies, each of which would be responsible for constructing two schemes (91 of



-3-
baseline costs). SEPRONI would be the central coordinating and monitoring
entity. Environmental impact statements have been prepared for each of the
subprojects, and appropriate environmental protection measures have been
included within the project. These includes (a) monitoring of water tables and
water quality; (b) monitoring of endemic diseases; (c) environmental education;
and (c) carefully planned land clearing programs. No new water storage
facilities vould be required, and the design of the systems, including the
drainage network and the selected irrigation methods, allow for efficient water
use and the adoption of sound environmental quality control practices.
7.       In order to maximize returns and ensure improved technology transfer to
small farmers, the project would have a mix of beneficiaries. Four types of
direct beneficiaries includes (a) about 3,380 qualified small farmers (6 to 8
ha plots) selected according to agreed criteria that ensure their capability to
operate their holdings on a commercial basis without government subsidies;
(b) about 590 medium size holders (16 to 24 ha plots), preferably farmers or
agricultural technicians with proven experience in commercial farming; (c) about
270 large irrigators, who, through a bidding process, would acquire farms
ranging from 24 to 100 ha; and (d) about 980 families affected by project
construction and who do not qualify as type (a). Settlement arrangements for
those families have been reviewed and agreed upon by the Bank, the Government
and the affected communities. They include a series of preparatory steps, the
physical transfer of families and their belongings, and the allocation of 2 to
4 ha irrigated plots close to their present homes within the project area. In
addition, the project would provide some simple irrigation equipment for about
160 small holders who live in areas directly adjacent to the project.
8.       A special Coordination Unit within SEPRONI would assist the executing
agencies in planning and ensure consistency with sector policies and guidelines;
provide technical implementation assistance to the executing agencies; supervise
implementation and organize a sector monitoring system and impact evaluation
activities. A Management Committee consisting of the Secretary for Irrigation
and the heads of the three Executing Agencies has already been established.
Project Management Units with Field Units would be established within each
executing agency. These units would be responsible for the initial organization
of each irrigation district and its conversion into an autonomous entity.
9.       The project, to be carried out over a five-year period, would finance:
(a) construction of off-farm irrigation and drainage works, electrical and road
networks, and on-farm equipment for small holders; (b) on a declining basis,
during a period of up to three years following completion of off-farm works,
agriculture extension and marketing services for farmers and operation and
maintenance costs of the irrigation districts; and services for environmental
protection; and (c) consultant services and technical assistance for
construction supervision and project administration and monitoring. The total
cost of the project is estimated at US$465.0 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of US$123.5 million. Water tariffs, to be collected by the
irrigation districts, would be charged to the project beneficiaries to fully
cover operation and maintenance costs and to recover public investments in off-
farm irrigation infrastructure in real terms plus an annual interest rate of 3Z,
in accordance with the terms established in the Federal Irrigation Law. Project
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in



-4
Schedule B. A timetable of key project proceseing events and the status of Bank
Group Operation in lasaxil are given in Schedules C sad D, respectlvely. Two
maps are attachdt, and the Staff Appraisal Report No. 0o06sn dated January 22,
1990 is being circulated separately.
10.      Areed Actions.  Conditions of loan effeAtfivness would boe  (i) a
satisfactory, siged agreement for the provision of technical assistance to
PROM? and preparation of a proposal, satisfactory to the Bank, for the provision
of technical assistance to D=M08; (Li) acquisition by CODZYASI, DNO05 and DN05
of all remaining irrigable lands of the projects (ill) a satisfactory, signed
Implementation Agreement between the federal Government and BIlOWNI, CODNVAS?,
DNOCS, and DN08; (iv) establishment by SDUOM? of a satisfactory system for
monitoring project activitiest (v) satisfactory evidence that the Covernment has
allocated adequate funds from its proposed fiscal year 1990 budget to be made
available to 8EPR0NI, DOC8, DU08 and CODEVA8P to Implement the project In 1990;
and (vi) a satisfactory Subsidiary Agreement entered Into by the Federal
Government and CODZVASF and satisfactory fianAclal arrangements entered Into by
the Federal Government and the other executing agencies, specifying the terms
and procedures for making loan funds available. The Government and CODIVASI
aQreed durina nesotiations that. (i) S10111 would maintain a satisfactory
Technical Office to oversee subsector planning and monitoring, and would
maintain a satisfactory Coordination Unit throughout the project implementation
period; Cii) the Government would make available to HWIAORA all funds for the
project in accordance with the schedule in the Annual Plang (iii) water charges
would be adjusted on an annual basis, according to a satisfactory methodology,
with proposed annual charges reviewed by the Bank; (iv) on completion of
construction by DNOS of the Guadalupe and the Tabuleiros Litoraneos irrigation
schemes, DNO8 would transfer to DNOCS full responsibility for overall management
of both schemest (v) CODEVASF and DNOCS would select beneficiaries by
December 31, 1991 and imediately thereafter establish satisfactory irrigation
districts; (vi) each irrigation district would subcontract, three months after
its establishment, the provision of extension and marketing services to a
satisfactory specialized firm, and operation and maintenance of the irrigation
works with a specialized contractor; (vii) DNOCS would sign a technical
assistance agreement by May 30, 1990 and maintain its special agricultural group
until the formal creation of a Directorate of Agricultural Operations, to be
proposed for final consideration to the appropriate authorities by October 31,
1990; (viii) CODEVASF, DNOS and DNOCS would implement the approved resettlement
plans in accordance with the terms defined in the resettlement plans; (ix) the
Executing Agencies would employ chiefs of the Management Units and field units
with qualifications satisfactory to the Bank; (x) DOCS would prepare a
satisfactory staff training and development plan by June 30, 1990; and
(xi) CODEVASF and DNOCS would sign satisfactory agreements with the
Superintendency of Public Health Campaigns by December 31, 1991, to carry out a
campaign against water-borne diseases in the project area.
-11.     Benefits.  The economic rate of return of the project would be about
16? with a range between 13.92 and 18.5? for the different irrigation schemes.
Main benefits would includes (a) incremental agricultural production valued at
some US$130 million annually at full development, and including agricultural
exports of about US$5 million; (b) a significant increase of income for small
holders from an average of about US$200 per capita to about US$1,000-US$l,600
per capita; and (c) generation at full development of about 29,000 man-years of



-5-
temporary or permanent employment. Estimated finncial rates of return for
settlers' farms would range between 251 to more than 70X.
12.      Risks.  The risks associated with the project are:  (a) delays and
shortfalls in counterpart funding; (b) institutional inefficiency; and
(c) potential farmer reluctance to pay water charges for full recovery of
capital and operation and maintenance costs.  To minimize the risk of inadequate
counterpart funds, agreements were reached with the Federal Government on
funding procedures and the amount of funds which will be included in the fiscal
budget for this project.  To ensure competent and efficient implemetatlon,
Project Management Units would be established in each of the Executing Agencies,
reporting directly to the head of the agency; field units would also be
established at each project site. The project would also include considerable
technical assistance to help further develop federal ageniiesl Amplementation
capabilities. The local collection of water charges by the irrigation districts
and improved enforcement of legal punitive measures to be set forth in the
contracts to be signed with the farmers, should lead to effective cost recovery.
13.      Recoanumdation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
