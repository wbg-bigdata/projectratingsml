CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS
The exchange rate is being adjusted daily in line with the difference
between domestic and international inflation. The exchange rate and
currency equivalents in effect on December 31, 1979, were as follows:
Currency Unit   =   Chilean Pesos (Ch$)
US$1             =   Ch$39
Ch$l             =   US$0.0256
Ch$1,000         =   US$25.64
Ch$1,000,000    =   US$25,641.03
MEASURES
1 mm       =  millimeter         =  0.04 inches
1 cm       =  centimeter         =  0.39 inches
I m        =  meter              =  3.28 feet
i km       =  kilometer          =  0.62 miles
1 m3       =  cubic meter        =  264 US gallons
1 m3/sec   =  cubic meter        =  22.82 MGD = million US gallons
per second                         per day

CHILE
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. GENERAL
1.01      The Government of Chile has requested IBRD assistance in financing
a water supply project in the capital city of Santiago and nationwide pro-
grams for technical assistance, water quality improvement, leak detection,
and metering. The estimated cost of the project is US$119.6 million and a
Bank loan of US$38.0 million is proposed to finance 100% of the foreign
exchange component. At project completion (June 1985) the incremental popula-
tion benefitting from the project would be 686,000 and would reach 1.86
million by 1995. The project would benefit some 2 million additional persons
at a national level. Most of the project beneficiaries in Santiago
are urban slum dwellers and 53% of them have a per capita income less than
one-third of the country's average income.
1.02      The project would be the first Bank operation in the water supply
and sewerage sector in Chile. Under the IBRD/WHO Cooperative Program, the
Bank participated in the sector study issued in March 1977 and its updating in
June 1978. The loan would be made to the Ministry of Public Works (MOP). The
Servicio Nacional de Obras Sanitarias (SENDOS), a decentralized agency under
the Ministry of Public Works will be the executing agency for the proposed
works at a national level, while the Empresa Metropolitana de Obras Sanitarias
(EMOS) will be the executing agency for the works in the Santiago Metropolitan
Region. The project was prepared by local consultants retained by EMOS. Bank
staff assisted SENDOS and EMOS in the preparation of the project.
II. THE SECTOR
Geography and Climate
2.01      Chile has an area of 760,000 km  on the Pacific Coast of South
America, extending some 4,300 km southward from the Peruvian border. Its
topography is dominated by the Andes ridge and some areas of the country are
subject to frequent violent earthquakes. Because of its latitudinal range,
Chile experiences many different climatic conditions. Sea currents make the
climate moderately warm and average annual temperatures are mild throughout
most of the year, decreasing southwards from a high average of 20 0C in the
north to a low average of 2.5°C in Punta Arenas, with an average temperature
of 10°C in the inner lands not affected by altitude.

Water Resources
2.02      Water resources are unevenly distributed throughout the country.
Desertic climatic conditions make water availability scarce in the north,
where only a few rivers reach the sea. Water supply is particularly difficult
in the city of Antofagasta, where sources are located 300 km from the city.
In the central areas rivers are fed by melting snow and groundwater during the
dry season and by rainfall during the winter; in the summer, melting ice and
snow from the mountains cause great variations in river flows. The greatest
water resources are found in the south, where population density is lower, and
rivers are fed by frequent and intensive rainfall.
2.03      Groundwater resources have not been completely evaluated except in
the Santiago Metropolitan Area. They constitute the main source of potable
water in several regions, mainly in the north, where surface water is particu-
larly scarce. The quality of water for many cities is often unsatisfactory as
pollutants are frequently found in amounts exceeding acceptable standards.
The quality of water is worse in rural areas, where in most cases it is not
chlorinated. A study carried out in 1975 to assess the need for bacteriological
and chemical laboratories for water quality control in urban and rural areas
throughout the country, estimated that 14 bacteriological and physico-chemical
water quality control centers were required. At the present time these labora-
tories are partially operational but need additional equipment (para 5.04b).
Although medium-term plans exist for the construction of water treatment facil-
ities in several cities, works have not yet started because of the scarcity
of financial resources.
2.04      Legislation ("Ley de Aguas" - Decree 2603 of April 18, 1979) has
been enacted recently assigning permanent rights on surface waters to present
users or to those having legal water concessions. In accordance with this
decree, water rights can be valued, traded and taxed. Water for public use
has priority for unassigned water rights.
Population
2.05      The estimated population in 1978 was 10.7 million inhabitants of
which 8.9 million (83%) were urban and 1.8 million (17%) rural. 1/ The ratio
between the urban and rural population has increased in recent years and accord-
ing to official estimates (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica), will continue
to do so in the future. National population growth is estimated at around
1.6% p.a. during the period 1980-85, one of the lowest in Latin America, and
it is expected to decrease to about 1.2% p.a. by the year 2000. The urban
population growth rate is expected to remain constant at about 2.5% p.a.
during the period 1975-85 and to decrease to about 1.9% p.a. by the year 2000.
The rural population is expected to have a negative growth rate of around
-0.75% p.a. during 1975-85 and decrease to -1.41% p.a. in 1995-2000 as
a result of the continuous migration to urban centers.
1/   Chile's census defines urban areas as those having:  (a) a street layout;
(b) services; and (c) a minimum of 40 clustered houses; otherwise they
are classified as rural.



- 3 -
2.06      The geographical distribution of the population is extremely uneven.
In 1978, the Santiago Metropolitan Region accounted for 45% of the urban
population and 39% of the country's total population. The Metropolitan Region
is followed by the 5th and 8th regions (capital cities Valparaiso and Concep-
cion, respectively), whose population, together with that of the Metropolitan
Region, accoi ts for 55% of the country's total population. The concentration
of the population in the central regions is a consequence of better employment
opportunities offered by industrial cities such as Santiago, Valparaiso, and
Concepcion where the high inflow of population results in large claims for
urban development and the provision of water and sewerage services.
Health Situation
2.07      Infectious and parasitic diseases were among the eight leading
causes of death, accounting for 6.2% in 1968 and gradually decreasing to 5.3%
in 1975. 1/ These mortality rates are among the lowest in Latin America
(Colombia 6.7%, Mexico 6.7%, Argentina 4.4%--1975). Enteritis and other
diahrreal diseases commonly associated with poor water supplies accounted for
about 40% of these deaths. Infant mortality rates caused by infectious and
parasitic diseases amounted to 21% of the total of all deaths in this age
bracket. Morbidity rates caused by enteric and other diahrreal diseases have
remained relatively constant during recent years (1974-77, 3.4 per 100,000
population).
Sector Institutions
2.08      SENDOS was created by decree of November 23, 1977 to coordinate
all sector activities. This was in line with the recommendations of a previous
IBRD/WHO sector study. 2/ SENDOS is a tax-exempt, financially autonomous body
with corporate status, under the Ministry of Public Works (MOP), and absorbed
the Direccion de Obras Sanitarias (DOS), the Oficina de Saneamiento Rural
(OSR) of the Ministry of Public Health, and the Oficina de Ingenieria Sanitaria
(OIS) of the Agrarian Reform Corporation (CORA). The Empresa Metropolitana de
Obras Sanitarias (EMOS) and the Empresa de Obras Sanitarias de la Quinta
Region (ESVAL) were also created to replace the Empresa de Agua Potable de
Santiago (EAPS) and the Empresa de Desagues de Valparaiso. In addition, water
and sewerage services under DOS in the Metropolitan Region were transferred to
EMOS. Water resources are under the legal responsibility of the Direccion

2.09      SENDOS is composed of a Central Office (Direccion Nacional) and 11
decentralized regional offices located in each geopolitical region of the
country (Table 2.1), with the exception of the Santiago Metropolitan Region
and Valparaiso (Region 5) which have their own semi-autonomous companies.
SENDOS' regional offices execute at the regional level the sector policies
established by SENDOS for urban and rural areas, and the man< ,ment, pro-
gramming, construction, operation, maintenance, and other activities related
to the provision of water and sewerage services within respective urban areas.
2.10      The Direccion Nacional of SENDOS is responsible for the planning,
financing, design, construction standards, and control of all sector works and
operations in the urban centers and rural communities of the 11 regional areas.
The Direccion Nacional also supervises the activities of the regional offices
as well as the activities carried out by EMOS and ESVAL.
2.11      SENDOS is also in charge of the execution of water supply works,
sanitation, the provision of technical assistance to small villages, and the
preparation of standards and operational manuals, staff training programs,
and other actions leading to the improvement of services in rural areas.
Operation and maintenance of these services are carried out by the users
organized as cooperatives or water commissions under SENDOS' supervision.
2.12      EMOS and ESVAL are decentralized companies related to the Ministry
of Public Works through SENDOS. They perform the same tasks as SENDOS' regional
offices and have the authority to allocate their revenues and other sources of
funds, but their budget is approved by SENDOS. There are a few private water
companies operating in the country under concessions granted by the Ministry
of Public Works. These companies are under SENDOS' supervision to ensure
that they conform to sector policies and service standards. Private and
decentralized water companies are subject to corporate income tax laws. 1/
2.13      The policy of the Government is to recover through tariffs and
other users' contributions all costs incurred in the provision of services,
i.e., operating costs, and debt service, and to earn a positive rate of
return on its revalued fixed assets. SENDOS, for the regional offices, and
EMOS and ESVAL, for Santiago and Valparaiso, propose the tariff levels
(para 6.03) to the Ministry of Public Works which in turn submits them to
the Ministry of Economy for approval. Tariffs are set up by Government decree
and apply to all public and private sector companies in the region.
2.14      The Government has been working successfully on improving the
efficiency of the sector and is now reassessing the sector's legal
framework and investment programs, its organization and their financial via-
bility. Government strategy to further increase the sector's efficiency is
to promote less centralized and more dynamic sector institutions. To this
end, SENDOS' regional offices would be reinforced and transformed into auto-
nomous, financially self-sufficient companies responsible for the provision
of water and sanitation services in the provinces under their jurisdiction.
SENDOS, at the central level, would exercise control, set standards and
norms and provide technical advise to the sector, sharing its planning

responsibilities with ODEPLAN (National Planning Office). The required
organizational changes would be supported by the proposed technical assistance
component of the project. Consultants, financed by the proposed loan, would
recommend to SENDOS the necessary steps and changes required to transform one
of the regional offices into an autonomous company, which would serve as a
model for the other ten. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
the technical assistance program would be carried out by qualified consultants
whose selection and terms of reference will be approved by the Bank. Assur-
ances were also obtained during negotiations that prior to any changes in the
legal status of SENDOS or EMOS the Bank would be notified and shall be provided
with a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon.
Service Levels
2.15      Chile ranked first in water services coverage in Latin America and
the Caribbean from 1938 to 1961, when the percentage served reached 71%. Due
to lower sector investment rates, the position of Chile's water services
slipped to 13th place in Latin America and the Caribbean by 1976, 1/ although
the percentage served increased. By the end of 1979, it is estimated that 85%
of the urban population had water services through house connections and 62%
were connected to sewerage systems (Table 2.1). The total proportion of urban
population served, including those with public standpipes, amounts to 93% in
the water subsector and 75% in the sewerage subsector, including population
served through septic tanks or other individual systems. Additional informa-
tion by region is presented in Table 2.1.
2.16      In rural areas the situation is far less satisfactory, with only
38% of non-dispersed rural population having access to safe water; of these,
80% are served through house connections.
2.17      Water supply shortages are a frequent problem during the dry season.
In cities such as Valparaiso these adverse effects are intensified by the high
water demand during the summer months from the neighboring beach resort of Vina
del Mar. This problem also affects extended areas of Metropolitan Santiago
where plans to improve the service would be implemented under the proposed
project.
2.18      The level of unaccounted-for water is high (currently estimated
between 30-50%, varying among regions) as a result of inadequate metering
and maintenance programs. A specific program for metering and leak detection
and repairs is included in the proposed project (paras 5.05 and 5.06).
2.19      In Santiago, Valparaiso, Concepcion, and other medium-size cities,
sewage disposed of without treatment often contaminates water courses used
for domestic as well as agricultural purposes, causing health hazards. A
sewerage master plan to be financed under the proposed project (para 5.08(h)),
will study alternative solutions for the Santiago Metropolitan Region, where
water pollution is the most severe.

Past Investments
2.20      In the past, tariff levels were kept low and Government grants were
required not only for investments, but to cover operating costs. About US$186
million were invested in the sector over the period 1973-79. Investments in
the Metropol ,an Region amounted to 28% of the total. Fifty-eight percent of
the funds were provided by the Government through grants. Although Government
contributions have been important, the sector in turn contributed to general
public finances through a value-added tax (IVA - established in late 1975,
this tax represents about 20% of gross sector revenues). The net transfer of
resources to the sector during this period is estimated at US$150 million. The
origin and use of funds are summarized in Table 2.2.

Government Objectives
2.21      SENDOS has prepared an ambitious national sector plan which
aims to achieve the following coverage levels by 1985:
(a)  water supply through house connections to 100%, and sewerage
to 70% (80% by 1990) of the population living in urban areas, and
(b)  water supply through house connections to 60% of the non-dispersed
rural population.
2.22      The program aims at extending the water and sewerage networks of
the communities to reach the above-mentioned coverages with only minimum
acceptable requirements in terms of quality and quantity. To fulfill these
targets, an additional total population of about 2.3 million would have to be
connected to the water systems in urban areas and around 1.1 million in rural
areas. The total projected investment required between 1980-85 to meet
these targets in urban areas is US$267 million 1/ in constant 1979 prices,
1/   Including the proposed US$117 million project works.



-8-
that is, an annual average of US$45 million. This compares to an annual
average of US$26 million during the period 1973-79. In addition, an invest-
ment of about US$50 million is contemplated for the rural areas over the
same period. No stated targets exist for rural sanitation. Achievement of
these goals (para 2.21) may be delayed because: (a) the annual investments
may be limited by Government efforts to control inflation and public expen-
ditures; (b) the low level of remuneration may limit the availability of
qualified staff required for its implementation; and (c) the sector's new
institutions (especially the regional offices) lack the experience to carry
out siuch an important program.
2.23      The magnitude of the investment required to reach such ambitious
targets for population served, together with the level of tariffs forecasted
and inefficiencies in both management and metering systems, make the achieve-
ment of financial autonomy by some regions difficult. Therefore Government
subsidies may be required initially for some critical regions (especially I
and II). Nevertheless, the Government's goal is for all regions to achieve
financial self-sufficiency and consequently is opposed to cross subsidies
between regions.
2.24      Investment plans for the future are prepared according to official
priorities established for the sector by SENDOS/MOP and reviewed by the
National Planning Office (ODEPLAN). They are intended to meet the most
urgent needs of each region. Investments which are not financially viable
(i.e. sewage treatment) would be studied by the recently created Social
Council, comprising five ministries, which makes decisions on Government
grants. Eighty-four percent of the total investment planned for the water
subsector over the period 1980-85 is allocated to urban areas, which account
for 83% of the country's population, leaving 17% for rural areas. The alloca-
tion of funds to carry out this plan takes into consideration the population
to be served in urban and rural areas (para 2.22) and reflects the Government's
priority to the urban areas.
2.25      Although there is a great need to extend sewerage systems in urban
areas, the Government has assigned priority to providing potable water services
to all urban population through house connections. Nevertheless, SENDOS is
contemplating sewerage works in urban areas, especially in Region VIII, where
sanitation problems are more pressing. SENDOS' plans to meet sector objectives
(para 2.21) assume that about 30% of the investment requirements (para 2.22)
would be financed by external funds which are being actively sought. Moreover,
IDB has lent US$7.5 million for the partial financing of a rural water supply
project.
Bank Participation
2.26      The Government's goals (para  2.21) of providing safe water and
ameliorating waste disposal problems in urban and rural areas are in accord-
ance with the Bank policy of assisting in the development of projects oriented
toward improving living conditions and reducing environmental health hazards
to the population, especially the urban poor. The proposed project supports
t1ie Government's objectives.

III. THE BORROWER AND THE BENEFICIARIES
A. General
3.01      The Borrower for the proposed loan would be the Republic of Chile
through the Ministry of Public Works (MOP). MOP would relend. under the same
terms, the respective loan amounts to the project beneficiaries: (a) SENDOS,
for the National project component; and (b) EMOS, for the Santiago component.
EMOS counterpart funds would be internally generated. SENDOS counterpart funds
for the National component would be internally generated, but if such internal
generation is not sufficient MOP would make available to SENDOS from its
budgetary allocations the funds required to carry out this project component.
B. Servicio Nacional de Obras Sanitarias (SENDOS)
Central Office
3.02      SENDOS' Central Office (Direccion Nacional) performs the planning
and coordination for the sector and controls the regional offices and all
Government or privately-owned water and sewerage companies in Chile. The
Director of SENDOS is appointed by the President of Chile from a list of three
names submitted by the Minister of Public Works, and reports directly to the
Minister. The main divisions within the Central Office (Annex 8, page 1)
are those concerned with: committee for institutional development, planning,
internal auditing, legal affairs, public relation, projects construction, rural
water supply, assistance and coordination, finance and administration.
Regional Offices
3.03      The regional offices (para. 2.10) are relatively decentralized and
administer and operate the water and sewerage services in each region. They
are headed by a director appointed by SENDOS' Director, and normally have five
departments:  engineering, operations, finances, administration, and rural
water supply (Annex 8, page 2).
Training
3.04      A record of all sector-related courses and seminars, held both
centrally and in the regions since 1971, was assembled by SENDOS and used for
reference purposes in undertaking a countrywide survey of training needs.
The resulting program to be executed between 1979-82 includes 118 courses
or about 12,500 hours of training for 4,100 participants.
3.05      The estimated cost for the training program approved by ODEPLAN
is US$0.5 million, and will be financed by SENDOS. Staff training needs will
be met mainly by local universities and Government training institutions.
This program will make extensive use of SENDOS' experimental center (CEXAS--
Centro Experimental de Aguas Servidas) in Melipilla, located 30 miles south of
Santiago. During the first year (1979), a total of 46 courses were carried
out with a total attendance of some 1,250 participants. SENDOS' training
program as conceived would meet the sector's requirements in an efficient way.



- 10 -
Evaluation
3.06      SENDOS is well organized and has qualified, although relatively
inexperienced, personnel. SENDOS has shown a considerable improvement in
all aspects of its administration and operation during the last five years.
SENDOS is highly concerned with its own efficiency and therefore the achieve-
ment of the lowest possible service costs. Personnel efficiency has increased
during the last four years 1/ and SENDOS' goal is to operate by 1981 with a
ratio of about four employees per thousand connections, a ratio similar
to U.S. water utilities and less than half the Latin American average of nine
per thousand. As a result of increased efficiency and an improved tariff
policy, the financial autonomy of SENDOS has been strengthened substantially
(Chapter VI).
3.07      Sector organization is likely to be substantially changed (para
2.14). SENDOS' regional offices would be transformed into fully autonomous
companies. These changes would occur during project implementation but
will not adversely affect project execution. Considerable technical assis-
tance would be needed to help the regional offices which are transforming into
independent companies. Therefore, the project includes a technical assistance
component directed to develop a model of organization and management systems
in Region VIII which would be replicated in other regions. Assurances were
obtained from the Government during negotiations that any corporation estab-
lished to perform the function of any SENDOS regional office shall be the
legal successor to all rights and obligations of such regional office under
the Bank's loan and project agreements.
C.   Empresa Metropolitana de Obras Sanitarias (EMOS)
3.08      EMOS is a semi-autonomous Government agency under SENDOS, and has
responsibility for planning, construction, and operation of water and sewerage
services for 91% of the urban population in the Metropolitan Region. The re-
maining 9% is served by two independent companies: Lo Castillo, a private
company serving Las Condes district 2/, and the Empresa Municipal de Agua
Potable de Maipu, which serves the district of Maipu. Both companies provide
adequate services (Map 14046). Groups of small, dispersed populations compris-
ing a few hundred persons are also served by independent services (La Puntilla,
La Parva, and Los Dominicos).
3.09      Santiago's water utility started more than a century ago.  In 1977
the Empresa de Agua Potable de Santiago (EAPS), the Direccion de Obras
Sanitarias (DOS), the Division de Servicios Sanitarios, and some other small
companies were consolidated to form EMOS and improve water and sewerage
services in Santiago.

Organization and Management
3.10      EMOS' present organizational structure (Annex 8, page 3) is the
result of the improvements made during the last four years 1/ with some
assistance from PAHO.
3.11      There are six major departments which have recently been restruc-
tured and which are headed by qualified, although somewhat inexperienced,
personnel: (a) Engineering and Planning Department, which coordinates the
preparation of feasibility reports and engineering designs (generally prepared
by consultants); (b) Construction Department, which prepares bidding documents,
proposes the awards, and supervises the execution of works; (c) Operations
Department, which operates the water treatment plants and maintains the water
distribution and sewerage system; (d) Commercial Department, in charge of
water metering and billing; (e) Financial Department, which administers all
financial resources, executes the budget, controls collection, and produces
the accounting results; and (f) Administration Department, which controls
personnel, training, vehicles, communications, supplies and other general
services.
3.12      Because of the territorial extension of the Metropolitan Region,
EMOS has four zonal offices (North, South, East and West) responsible for the
installation, operation, administration, and maintenance of the house connec-
tions and small-diameter water and sewerage pipes within each zone. Each
zonal office has three departments: Administrative (control of vehicles and
supplies, fixed assets, personnel); Commercial (metering, statistics); and
Engineering (maintenance, house connections, supervision of small works,
vehicle control).
Evaluation
3.13      EMOS has progressed considerably in the last three years but
still faces the problems of a new organization and the difficulties of
integrating previously separate entities and personnel. EMOS would benefit
from the technical assistance provided for in the project (para 5.03).
Assistance for the most critical areas (computerized accounting, tariffs,
income taxes, inventory management) has been contracted using qualified
consultants. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Bank
would be given the opportunity to comment on the results of these studies
before June 30, 1981.
3.14      EMOS' chief executive and legal representative is the General
Manager, who reports to SENDOS' Director. Coordination among division chiefs
and zonal directors is the responsibility of the Assistant Manager. These
two managers are appointed by the President of Chile from a list of three
names submitted by the Minister of Public Works. These positions are now
filled by competent engineers.

-12 -
3.15      Medium or long-term planning and simple basic statistics did not
exist until three years ago, resulting in over-investment and inadequate
planning. The Engineering and Planning Department is very active and
produces monthly basic statistics and monitoring indicators for management
(para. 6.18).
3.16      The Data Processing Department operates an IBM 370-125 computer
and has satisfactory programs for billing, payroll, fixed assets and project
evaluation.
Personnel
3.17      EMOS has been concerned about the efficiency of its operation,
and has streamlined its staff from 2,870 in 1974 to 2,058 at the end of 1979.
EMOS' goal is to maintain the present ratio of about 3.7 employees per thousand
connections which is better than the average U.S. water utility's ratio of
4:1,000 and would be the lowest in Latin America. This increase in efficiency
is a result of contracting some services, intensive training programs, and
hiring of dynamic and qualified personnel for many key positions. Neverthe-
less, the present motivation and drive may not continue if the salary level,
fixed for all public sector institutions in Chile, continues to be 30-40%
below the level of comparable jobs in the private sector. Legislation is
being proposed by the Government which would allow EMOS and SENDOS regional
offices to have levels of salaries comparable with other autonomous public
enterprises.
Billing and Collection
3.18      By the end of 1979, EMOS billed 583,000 customers.  The number of
connections unmetered or with inoperative meters has been reduced from 60,000
in 1977 to 30,000 in 1979. The restoration and installation of water meters
up to 1984 is included in the proposed project so as to reach and maintain an
effective level of metering of over 96%. Meter reading has been contracted
with private firms, bringing a reduction of costs. Meters are read monthly,
under EMOS' supervision, and customers are billed three to four days later.
3.19      Connection charges and installation fees are billed separately with
terms for the urban poor of up to 36 months, and no interest, but adjusted for
inflation. All bills are collected through commercial banks but clients in
arrears must pay their bills directly to EMOS' offices. The number of clients
in arrears for more than two months reached a peak in 1976. To solve this
problem, EMOS had implemented a program of water shut-offs (around 34,000 per
month) for delinquent accounts based on the size of the bill or the number of
months in arrears. 1/ To compensate for the reduction in value due to infla-
tion, Legislative Decree 1057 of June 15, 1975, authorized public companies to
charge 1.5 times the current commercial banks' rate of interest on delinquent
accounts. Agreements for long-term payments are prepared by EMOS when re-
quested by clients. However, accounts receivable are still excessive and are
being reduced from five to three months of revenues and EMOS' Commercial
Department is planning to implement additional measures to reduce them to
no more than two months by the end of 1981. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that accounts receivable, net of a reasonable provision for bad
debts would not exceed three months of billing by the end of 1980, and two
months in 1981 and thereafter.

Accounting Systems - Fixed Assets
3.20      A new computerized accounting system being implemented by external
consultants has resulted in delays of up to five months in the presentation
of financial results; this problem is expected to be solved after the system
is completed by June 1980. In May 1979, consultants conclud,Q the inventory
and valuation of EMOS' fixed assets at replacement cost (para 6.10). The
net effect was a 60% revaluation over the nominally revalued book values
(Annex 4). The revaluation is acceptable to the Bank and has been approved
by Chile's Contraloria and the Ministry of Economy.
Financial Planning
3.21      Financial planning in the past has been poor, since any cash short-
fall was covered by MOP. Economic evaluation of the now proposed capital
investments and long-term financial projections were established during
project preparation. Training was provided by the Bank in the form of EDI
and mission staff participation in a course in Project Evaluation and also by
Bank and IDB missions on financial and economic evaluation models which are
now widely used by EMOS' personnel. The steps already taken by EMOS in
establishing the Planning Unit within the Engineering Department, the reorgan-
ization of its Financial Department, and the interest of EMOS' management in
these matters, together with the Government's requirement for financial
autonomy and efficiency in all public corporations, would suggest that proper
attention to financial planning will be given in the future.
Audit
3.22      Internal audit is weak and is being reinforced by EMOS' management.
Audit by the Government Controller's Office is not sufficiently comprehensive,
and should be complemented by an external audit. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that, starting in 1980 and 1981 respectively, EMOS' and
SENDOS' financial statements would be audited annually by competent independent
auditors satisfactory to the Bank and in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that a certified copy of their report would be
presented to the Bank by EMOS not later than June 30, 1981 for the fiscal year
ending December 31, 1980, and by SENDOS and EMOS not later than April 30 of
the following years.
Insurance
3.23      EMOS carries insurance to cover personnel accidents, imported goods,
and vehicles. EMOS is self-insured for other risks (fire, earthquakes, etc.)
which have a low expectancy. Assurances were obtained from EMOS during nego-
tiations that it will carry out a study, under terms of reference satisfactory
to the Bank and the Borrower, on the adequacy of its insurance coverage and
that would deliver such study to the Bank for comments not later than
December 31, 1981. In addition, assurances were obtained during negotiations
that EMOS and SENDOS will take out or maintain insurance consistent with
appropriate practice.

IV. POPULATION, SERVICES, AND DEMAND IN THE SANTIAGO METROPOLITAN REGION
General
4.01      The Santiago Metropolitan Region includes 32 districts, 17 of
which comprise Greater Santiago, the capital of Chile; the remaining 15 have
urban centers dispersed throughout the area. The Metropolitan Region is located
in the central part of the country on the western flanks of the Andes and has
a total population of 4.09 million (1978 - Table 4.3). It has an area of
13,800 km2 and the majority of its population lives on the central plateau
which slopes gently to the west. Santiago is located at an elevation of 600 m
above sea level.  It enjoys a mild climate throughout the year with an average
rainfall of 350 mm/year and average low temperatures of 9 C during the winter
months and high temperatures of 30 C during the summer.
4.02      The Metropolitan Region plays a central role in the economic activ-
ity of the country as it generates about 45% of the GNP, 44% of the country's
industrial output, and employs 56% of the country's urban labor force. In the
foreseeable future, the Metropolitan Region will continue to play a leading
role in the economic activity of the country.
4.03      EMOS' system (para  3.08 and Annex 10) provides water to 3.2 million
people through house connections and to 0.24 million through public standpipes;
the Maipu and Lo Castillo Water Companies provide service to 0.36 million
people through house connections (Table 4.3). The provision of solid waste
collection and disposal services is generally adequate and under the responsi-
bility of each of the municipalities in the Metropolitan Region.
EMOS - Existing Water Supply and Sewerage System
4.04      The main water supply sources for the Metropolitan Region are the
Maipo River (average flow 83 m3/sec) and the Mapocho River (average flow 8 m3/
sec).  There are other smaller surface water and groundwater sources (safe
yield 20 m /sec). These sources are believed to be adequate to meet the
expected urban and agricultural demands up to the end of the century. After
this date water from the Cachapoal River is being considered by the MOP's
Direccion General de Aguas to cover demand.
4.05      Production capacity is about 19 m3/sec (600 million m3/year) of
which 16 m3/sec (8 %) can be provided by gravity from surface water sources
(La una Negra, 4 m /sec; Rio Maipo-Vizcachas-Vizcachitas, 12 m3/sec), and
3 m /sec (16%) from groundwater sources by deep wells and infiltration
galleries. The intake and raw water aqueduct capacity of the Rio Maipo-
Vizcachas-Vizcachitas system of 15 m3/sec is presently restricted to 12 m3/sec
by the treatment capacity at Las Vizcachas-Vizcachitas plants; this restriction
would disappear once the optimization works at these plants, to be carried out
under the proposed project, are completed (para 5.08(a)). However, under the



- 15 -
new water legislation (para. 2.04) EMOS' water rights on the Maipo River,
the main source of water for the Santiago Metropolitan area, are only 7%
of the daily river flow, corresponding to only 3-4 m3/sec in summer months
of dry years, while EMOS is using about 12 m3/sec from this source. To cover
this gap EMOS has initiated action to obtain legal rights on additional
volumes of wat r from the Maipo River. To this end EMOS is claiming owner-
ship on an additional 7% of the Maipo River flow still unassigned, based
on the transference to EMOS of water rights of irrigated lands which have
been urbanized. In addition DGA (Direccion General de Aguas, MOP) has agreed
to assign to EMOS the right to use waters of the Yeso Reservoir, which
regulates the flow of the Maipo River. MOP is finishing works in this Reser-
voir, which will increase its capacity from 220 to 250 million m3. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations, that as a condition of disbursements for
the Vizcacha Plant expansion the Bank shall be provided with satisfactory
evidence that EMOS is entitled to dispose of not less than fifteen cubic
meters of water per second from the Maipo river.
4.06      Raw water quality varies widely according to source, as shown in
Table 4.1. Water from the Maipo River is treated at Las Vizcachas-Vizcachitas
Treatment Plant, which provides conventional flocculation, sedimentation, and
filtration facilities. Water from Laguna Negra is subject to microfiltration.
All water delivered to the distribution system is chlorinated and meets
Chilean 1/ and WHO standards.

74 ground and elevated water storage tanks with a capacity of 371,000 m
(8 hours' average demand) and 572,000 house connections (as of December 1978).
4.08      The sanitary sewerage system includes 5,550 km (10.'~ a/connection) of
collection mains and about 522,000 connections which discharge without treat-
ment into the Mapocho River (north area), the Zanjon de la Aguada (central
area), and Maipo River (south area) (Map 14046).
4.09      Health indicators for the Metropolitan Region are presented in
Table 4.2. It is believed that the high incidence of enteric diseases, infec-
tious hepatitis, and typhoid fever in the Metropolitan Region is due mainly
to the consumption of raw vegetables and fruits irrigated with river waters
which have been contaminated by the discharges from the sewerage system. The
sewerage master plan to be financed under the proposed project will study
alternative solutions to this problem (para 5.08(h)).

Population and Service Levels
4.10      EMOS' system provides water service by means of 583,000 connections
(as of December 1979) to 3.27 million people and through public standpipes to
about 240,000 persons, mainly urban poor. The Maipu and Lo Castillo Water
Companies provide water service through some 65,000 connections to about
340,000 people. Most of the population served by EMOS (91%) is concentrated in
the Greater Santiago Area while the remaining live in some 20 small towns
("satelites") dispersed throughout the Metropolitan Region. Almost all of the
urban population has adequate waste disposal facilities, either through a con-
nection to the sewerage system (82%) or by means of septic tanks (1%) or dry
latrines (16%). Population and service levels in December 1978 are presented
in Table 4.3.

Water Production and Consumption
4.11      Water production to supply the urban needs of the Metropolitan
Region in 1978 was estimated at 536 million m3 (17 m3/sec) of which
404 million m3 (12.8 m3/sec) was supplied by EMOS, 68 million m3 (2.1 m3/sec)
by the Maipu and Lo Castillo Water Companies and 64 million m3 (2.0 m3/sec)
by some 200 industries with private wells.
4.12      Water consumption (EMOS, 1977-78) varies seasonally from a low of
15.3 million m3/month during winter (27.5 m3/month/connection or 82% of the
average) to a high of 22.3 million m /month (40.4 m3/month/connection, or 121%
of the average). Of a total of 252 million m3 consumed in 1978 by EMOS' users,
189 million m3 (75%) were for residential use, 23 million m3 (9%) for commercial
use, 10 million m3 (4%) for industrial use, and 30 million m3 (12%) were for
public standpipes and Government users. Distribution of consumption varies
widely among consumers as typified by consumption by residential users as
shown in Table 4.4.

Population and Demand Projections
4.13       In 1978, the Santiago Metropolitan Region's urban population was
estimated at 3.91 million and 0.18 million rural. The average growth rate
from 1960 to 1970 was 3.1% p.a. and is expected to decline gradually from 2.6%
p.a. in 1978-80 and to 2.1% p.a. in 1995-2000. In 1990 the urban population
of the Metropolitan Region is projected to be 5.35 million, which would
represent 46% of the country's estimated urban population. Population, service
levels, and demand projections since 1977 are shown in Table 4.5, and Annex 9.

4.14      The lack of adequate distribution system maintenance programs in the
past, the very old pipes in some areas of the city, the lack of overflow level
controls in distribution storage tanks, and the malfunctioning meters of around
10% of house connections account for the high percentage of unaccounted-for
water (37% of production in 1978) by EMOS. This figure may, however, be
distorted due to inadequate water production metering.
4.15      The average per capita production in 1978 was 346 liters/day, the
per capita consumption 216 liters/day, and the unaccounted-for water 130
liters/capita/day. Consumption by those urban poor who use public standpipes
is estimated at 40 liters/capita/day.
4.16      Average consumption per connection declined from 39 m3/month in
1977 to 36.8 m3/month in 1978 due to large tariff increases (60%) in real
terms, but in 1979 reached again 39 m3/month/connection. Taking into consid-
eration the 20% tariff increase in real terms assumed during project execution
(para 6.11), the lower consumption of the urban poor to be served, and the
improvements in pressure and the estimated increase in the population's
income 1/, the water demand has been estimated at 37.5 m3/month/connection.
4.17      Water service coverage by house connections is expected to increase
from 90% in 1979 to 99% of population in 1984. As no major sewerage works are
contemplated, sewerage coverage by house connections (82.1% in 1979) is expected
to decline somewhat during project execution. However, a gradual improvement
from 1984 onwards is expected to bring the service level up to 85% by 1986.
Unaccounted-for water is forecasted to decline from the 37.6% in 1978 to 25% by
1984 and remain constant thereafter, taking into account the leak detection
and metering program included in the proposed project (para. 5.08(d)).
V. THE PROJECT
Project Origin
5.01      Since November 1977, Bank missions have visited Chile to assist
SENDOS and EMOS in the identification and subsequent preparation of the
project. The investment programs initially presented by SENDOS and EMOS which
were too ambitious, were reduced substantially during project preparation to
keep them in line with availability of funds, institutions execution capacity,
and real demand as a consequence of a detailed reassessment of previously
reported low service levels and higher per capita water demands. It is
expected that the project will be completed by June 30, 1985.

- 21 -
A.   The National Component
Project Objectives
5.02      The objectives of the proposed National component to be  executed
by SENDOS are:
(a) To assist SENDOS in making institutional improvements in its
administration especially in the organization of its regional
offices into autonomous water and sewerage authorities;
(b) To improve the environmental and health conditions of the whole
urban population of Chile through a nationwide chlorination
program that will provide bacteriologically safe water to all
urban areas by 1983; and to provide adequate laboratory equip-
ment for water quality control in urban and rural areas in all
regions of Chile;
(c) To improve the financial and operational performance of the sector
regional offices through a national metering program of production
sources and house connections;
(d) To help SENDOS' regional offices to utilize in a more rational
way the existing production capacity in most cities with more
than 50,000 people through a leak detection and correction program.
Project Description
Technical Assistance
5.03      Government decentralization plans call for the establishment of
regional water companies (para. 2.14) as soon as they are prepared to take
this responsibility. The technical assistance program 1/ would-be directed
to the analysis of the existing organization and management procedures of the
SENDOS office in Region VIII, which would serve as a pilot organization for
other regions and to recommend and implement the necessary changes to become
an efficient and self-sufficient autonomous company. The technical assistance
program would then advise SENDOS in the implementation of the same organiza-
tional procedures in the remaining regions. The technical assistance will:
(a) Evaluate and make recommendations on the organization and systems
required for the SENDOS office in Region VIII to operate as an auto-
nomous company, including planning, data processing, budgeting,
accounting, internal audit, engineering, commercial systems, tariffs
and administrative procedures;
1/   Several consultants are already helping SENDOS in the evaluation of
fixed assets, and developing improved computational procedures (to be
finished by mid-1980) for billing, collection, inventory management
and general accounting. PAHO also provided assistance (1978-79) in
the organizational, commercial and financial areas.



- 22 -
(b) Prepare all norms, instructions and operating manuals
required in these areas; and
(c) Advice on the adaptation of the proposed systems to other
regions.
Water Quality improvement
5.04      This project component includes:
(a) Provision of 180 chlorination facilities in 36 cities (Annex 1)
to benefit an estimated 1.8 million people by 1983. This program
includes the purchase and installation of chlorination equipment
and the acquisition of chlorine containers, handling facilities,
safety equipment, and spare parts.
(b) Purchase of laboratory equipment for physico-chemical and
bacteriological control of water quality in all urban and rural
areas of the country. The program would help provide adequate
equipment for all 14 existing regional laboratories (Annex 1).
Metering
5.05      The program includes:
(a) Purchase and installation of some 400 water production meters
in 230 cities (Annex 1) and calibration of all existing water
production meters; and
(b)  Metering of house connections to reach a 95% metering level
in all urban areas. Under this program a total of 167,000
meters will be installed, corresponding to a 33% increase over
the existing 499,000 meters in working condition (Annex 1).
Leak Detection Program
5.06      Complementing the metering program, SENDOS will undertake an ambi-
tious leak detection and correction program in 11 cities in eight Regions
with an estimated total population of 1.8 million by 1980, to ensure a more
rational use of existing water resources in these cities. A minimum of
2,000 km of pipe will be surveyed, equivalent to 60% of the total pipe network
in these cities (Annex 1).
B.   The Santiago Component
Project Objectives
5.07      The objectives of the proposed Santiago subproject to be executed by
EMOS are:



- 23 -
(a)  To provide service through house connections to an additional
population of 686,000 by June 1985, 1/ mainly slum dwellers who
live in nearby urban centers (satelites) or in Greater Santiago
(53% of the project beneficiaries have incomes below the relative
poverty threshold); 2/
(b)  To increase the production, transmission, and distribution
capacity of the water system to be able to satisfy the expected
demand up to 1995;
(c)  To improve EMOS' financial position by a vigorous house connec-
tion, metering, and meter replacement program in order to have
an effective level of metering of over 96% by 1983;
(d)  To improve the operation of the water system and reduce its
operating costs through:
(i) a reduction of unaccounted-for water from 37.6% in 1978 to
25% by 1984;
(ii) metering of water production; and
(iii) phasing out obsolete or temporary pumping equipment and
replacing it with gravitational supplies from the existing
distribution system;
(e) To assess water pollution from existing sewage discharges and
develop a comprehensive sewerage master plan including a pollution
abatement program by December 1982.
Project Description
5.08      The proposed Santiago project consists of extensions and improve-
ments in the water supply system shown schematically in Annex 10 and Map 14046
and includes the following:
(a)  Expansion and improvement of Las Vizcachas-Vizcachitas water
treatment plant to increase its production capacity from 12 to
15 m3/sec, including an additional effluent pipeline from the
plant to convey the increased capacity;
(b)  Construction of nine deep wells and related pumping stations to
supply water to nine isolated nearby urban centers (satelites)
where 159,000 persons, mostly urban poor, live;
(c)  Improvement and extension of a transmission pipeline and network
distribution system which includes:
1/   The project benefits would reach a population of about 1.86 millfon
by 1995.
2/   One-third the country's average per capita income (para. 7.07).



- 24 -
(i)  85 km of feeder mains, 200 mm to 1,500 mm in diameter;
(ii) replacement of 200 km of pipes in poor condition;
(iii) 200 km of mains to supply the needs of the urban poor
in Greater Santiago and the satelites;
(iv) 330 km of mains required for adequate operation of the
distribution system;
(v)  Construction of seven storage tanks in Greater Santiago
and eight storage tanks in the satelites, with a total
volume of about 90,000 m3;
(vi) extension of the transmission line of the Third Aqueduct
(length about 9.9 km and diameter about 1,700 mm);
(d) A leak detection and correction program in which 3,000 km of
pipes will be surveyed and leaks corrected;
(e) Installation of 53,000 new water connections for slum dwellers
in the Metropolitan Region; 1/
(f)  Purchase and installation of 120,000 house connection meters
and master meters at production sources;
(g) Purchase of operating and maintenance equipment for the water
supply and sewerage systems; and
(h) A sewerage master plan to cover needs up to the year 2000,
including an assessment of river pollution in the Metropolitan
Region and completion of the topographical survey of existing
sewers. The plan would recommend the proposed degree of treat-
ment and the location of sewage treatment plants, as well as
priority works to be implemented during the first stage and
their preliminary design based on least-cost solutions.
Engineering
5.09      Final engineering is completed or well advanced for all major works
both in SENDOS and EMOS. It is estimated that an equivalent of 70% of the
EMOS program and 80% of the SENDOS program are already designed and that bids
for about 40% of the total project components would be called during the first
year of project execution (Graph 5.1).
5.10      The works for the National component are an important part of the
sector investment program and were prepared by SENDOS. EMOS' program is part
of the Water Supply Master Plan prepared in 1978 by local consulting engineers
(ICC-INDECON) of Santiago and EMOS' Engineering Department. This study is a
comprehensive analysis of demand, service levels, and alternatives of supply
to meet demands up to 1995. The Master Plan analyzes feasible alternatives to
1/   69,500 additional water connections will be provided by private developers.

supply demand from existing groundwater sources which require pumping and
which show a definite trend of falling water tables, and from existing gravity
supplies which could be expanded at relatively low cost. The proposed works
for this subproject were found to be least-cost solutions at discount rates
between 8% and 17%. Some of the recommended wor.ks were built (first section
of the Third Aqueduct) with EMOS resources. In view of a recent house survey
undertaken at the Bank's recommendation, which indicated higher service levels
(81%) than previously reported (55%), the sewerage works have been postponed
until a reassessment is made in the Sewerage Master Plan included in the
project. All engineering studies were reviewed by the Bank during appraisal
and their conclusions and recommendations found acceptable.
Project Costs
5.11      High prevailing rates of local inflation, combined with a policy of
devaluation of the Chilean peso in line with foreign inflation and uncertainty
in predicting local inflation, make presentation of project costs in US dollar
equivalents preferable. The estimated cost of the project is US$119.6 million
equivalent (Table 5.1) with a foreign component of US$38 million (32%). Cost
estimates have been based on bills of quantities prepared by SENDOS' Engineering
Department and EMOS consultants for those project components with final engineer-
ing or feasibility reports and include the value added tax on materials and
equipment which represents about 8% of project cost. Estimates for the leak
detection and correction programs in SENDOS and EMOS were obtained on the basis
of average detection and repair costs per kilometer of pipe to be surveyed.
Basic costs were estimated at January 1980 price levels. Physical contingency
allowances vary from 5% to 20% (averaging 15% for EMOS and 9% for SENDOS)
according to the type and location of works and degree of advancement of
engineering. Price contingencies were based on a disbursement profile of five
years starting in 1980 and on estimates of inflation trends 1/ for imported
equipment and materials similar to the assumed external price increases and 1%
higher for local costs for the period covered by the project. EMOS engineering
and leak-detection consultant costs are estimated at US$5.49 million, including
1944 man-months of support staff (1,050 man-months) and technical staff services,
the cost of leak detection equipment, vehicles, local transportation, and
general administrative costs. The average man-month cost (including salary,
fees, international travel and subsistence) for technical staff is US$3,500;
the average cost for locally hired technicians is US$2,600 per (772 man-months)
and the average cost for expatriates is US$9,000 per man-months (122 man-month)
(Annex 7). SENDOS technical assistance and leak-detection consultant costs
are estimated at US$2.37 million, including 450 man-months of support staff
(120 man-month and) technical staff services, the cost of leak detection
equipment, vehicles, local transportation, and general administrative costs.
The average man-month cost for technical staff is US$5,240; the average cost
for locally hired technicians is US$2,600 (96 man-month) and the average cost
for expatriates is US$6,300 per man-month. Due to the technical capability
1/   10.5% in 1980, 9% in 1981-82, and 8% thereafter.  If the periodic deva-
luation of the Chilean peso is not continued the foreign component,
as measured in dollars, woud not be affected. The local component would
have price increases expressed in dollars equivalent to the local
inflation rate. These increases would be financed by the higher
internal generation provided by the covenanted rate of return under
such circumstances (para 6.17).

of the local consulting firms moderate expatriate personnel input is
expected for supervision of construction. The technical assistance program
for SENDOS, the Santiago Sewerage Master Plan and leak-detection programs will
probably be undertaken by a domestic/expatriate joint venture. Costs do not
include engineering expenses already incurred, and interest during construction
(para 7.15). Detailed project costs are presented in Annex 1.

5.13      The Santiago project component, to be executed between 1980-84,
has an estimated cost of US$104.6 million, of which US$27 million (26%)
is the estimated foreign exchange component. Project component costs are
shown in Table 5.3 and Annex 1.
Financing
5.14      The Bank loan of US$38 million would finance 32% of the project cost,
covering 100% of the estimated foreign exchange cost of the project and would
finance US$27 million (26%) of the Santiago component and US$11 million (73%)
of the National component. EMOS' internally-generated funds would provide the
remaining US$77.6 million (74%) of the respective component cost and SENDOS'
internal generation would finance the remaining US$4.0 million of the National
component. Assurances were obtained from the Government during negotiations
that MOP's would provide from its budgetary allocations the counterpart funds
which could not be internally generated. Proceeds of the loan would be made
available by MOP through subsidiary loan agreements to EMOS and to SENDOS for
investments in each of the regional offices on the same terms and conditions
as the Bank loan. EMOS and the regional offices will assume the foreign
exchange risk on their respective parts of the loan. The signature of sub-
sidiary loan agreements with EMOS and SENDOS, satisfactory to the Bank, would
be a condition for disbursement of their respective loan components. In
addition assurances were obtained from the Government during negotiations
that the interest and principal of the Bank loan for the National project
component would be collected by MOP from the regional offices or companies
proportionately to their respective project investment.
Implementation
5.15      The project will be executed by SENDOS and EMOS during 1980-84 in
accordance with the construction schedule shown in Graph 5.1. National project
components have been prepared or will be prepared by SENDOS' Engineering
Department and in the case of the Santiago component by competent consultants
retained, or to be retained, by EMOS. Assurances were obtained during negotia-
tions that SENDOS will retain qualified consultants, under terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank, for the execution of the leak detection and technical
assistance programs. Supervision and control of the national project component
execution will be carried out by SENDOS. Assurances were obtained from EMOS
during negotiations that it will retain qualified consultants, under terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank, for (a) the preparation of bidding documents,
tender analysis and the supervision of construction of its project components
(hiring of such consultants by EMOS would be a condition of loan disbursement
for this subproject); and (b) for carrying out the leak detection program and
the sewerage master plan. Bank supervision would focus on the technical
assistance program to SENDOS and its regional offices, and on the engineering
and management assistance to EMOS. Three supervision missions a year (24
man-weeks per year) are planned for the first two years and two per year for
the following two years.



- 30 -
5.16      The proposed investment programs and construction schedule have
been discussed with SENDOS and EMOS and are compatible with their execution
capabilities. SENDOS and EMOS are staffed with young but qualified personnel,
who with appropriate consultant assistance as provided for if the project,
would be able to execute the proposed works satisfactorily.
Procurement
5.17      All procurement will be made in accordance with the Bank's procure-
ment guidelines which have been discussed with MOP, SENDOS and EMOS. Contracts
in excess of US$1.0 million for civil works or US$200,000 for the purchase of
equipment or materials would be awarded on the basis of international competi-
tive bidding. Contracts less than US$1.0 million but over US$50,000 for civil
works, or less than US$200,000 but over US$50,000 for purchase of equipment,
would be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding, the procedures
for which are satisfactory. The aggregate amount of the contracts so procured
shall not exceed the equivalent of US$2.0 million for the National component
and US$4.0 million for the Santiago component. Contracts of less than
US$50,000 would be procured directly on the basis of a minimum of three
quotations and subject to a maximum aggregate of US$500,000 for the National
component and US$1.0 million for the Santiago component. Contracts would be
grouped to make them attractive for international competitive bidding. No
works under force account are envisaged. Proposed major contracts for civil
works and equipment purchases are shown in Graph 5.1.
5.18      Foreign suppliers are expected to win most of the equipment and
large diameter pipe supply contracts. Contracts for engineering supervision
and the preparation of the Santiago sewerage master plan would be awarded to
local firms, probably in association with foreign firms. Given the advanced
development of the civil works construction industry in Chile, all civil works
are expected to be won by local contractors. For all contracts under interna-
tional competitive bidding (ICB), SENDOS and EMOS would make available to
the Bank for prior review and approval copies of the bidding documents, bid
analysis report, and recommendations for award. A draft of the general condi-
tions for all ICB and local procurement tender documents would be prepared
for the first bid and, upon Bank approval, would be used for subsequent bids.
Contracts awarded under local competitive bidding procedures would be submitted
to the Bank for ex-post review and disbursements will be made only after the
Bank is satisfied with this review. Goods manufactured locally and procured
under ICB would be allowed a preference of 15% of the CIF price (or the level
of applicable import duty, whichever is lower) over foreign goods.

Disbursement
5.19      The project would be completed by December 31, 1984, and the closing
date would be June 30, 1985. Table 5.4 shows the estimated schedule of dis-
bursements. Proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would be disbursed under the
following categories:

Environmental Aspects
5.20        The expansion of Santiago's water supply which would result from
the project would lead to an increase in the volume of sewage to be discharged
into existing and already polluted water courses. This should be of concern
in the Metropolitan Region where sewage treatment needs to be und -taken
in the near future. The proposed EMOS project includes funds to develop a
sewerage master plan (para 5.08(h)) which will define inter alia the location
of sewage treatment plants and the required degree of treatment. Given their
nature, the National project components will not increase the volume of sewage
already produced in the cities where works are proposed.

VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
SENDOS' Past Finances
6.01      SENDOS presently operates and controls water and s rerage activities
in Chile, and directly operates the services of 437 urban areas. Prior to the
creation of SENDOS in 1977, responsibility for the sector was divided among
several institutions (para 2.08) depending on different ministries, and there
is limited information on past finances (para 6.05). For many years the sector
has depended on Government grants for investment since tariffs were low and
were not fully adjusted for inflation rates which in some years exceeded
several hundred percent per year, resulting in decreased service levels and
the dependence of the sector on Government grants for operations, as shown
below:
1968    1973    1968-73    1978
---------(Percentages)---------
Revenues                             32        5       17         53

Operating ratio before
depreciation (%)                  138     900       253        109
6.02      Under these circumstances, the habit of paying for water has been
very difficult to develop. Tariff increases of 160% in real terms made
between 1975-79 reflect an extraordinary effort on the part of the Govern-
ment and the population to correct past distortions.
Tariffs
6.03      The latest tariff changes (December 1979, Annex 5) unified the
price of water for all users and eliminated several tariff distortions.
The present tariff structure is 3acceptable to the Bank.  Tariffs allow
for a basic consumption of 10 m and progressive consumption charges; they
also include fixed charges and minimum consumption levels which depend on
the hydraulic capacity of the connection and increase proportionally to the
square of its diameter. Water consumed by the urban poor through public
standpipes is generally provided free of charge and consumption through a
house connection is affordable by the urban poor (monthly water and sewerage
charges are less than one day's minimum salary - Annex 5). Connection charges
(aportes) are capital contributions by new consumers (water US$300 - sewerage
US$189) and the urban poor are allowed up to 48 months to pay (without interest
but adjusted for inflation). Installation fees are US$85 for water and US$55
for sewerage and the urban poor are exempt from up to 50% of this fee.

SENDOS: Future Finances
6.04      SENDOS' projections assume the execution of the five-year investment
plan (1980-84) for the extension of water services, which includes integrated
solutions for water and sewerage systems in all regions, including EMOS, at a
total estimated cost of US$267 million at 1979 prices (para. 2.22).
6.05      High rates of inflation and uncertainty in their prediction distort
the interpretation of financial results which are therefore presented in
current dollars. Current costs or revenues are converted to equivalent values
at the end of each year, using the consumer price index (CPI) and then converted
into current dollars at the rate prevailing at the end of each year (27.96 in
1977, 33.95 in 1978, 39 in 1979). A general price increase of 10.5% is being
used for 1980, 9% for 1981-82, and 8% thereafter. Financial results for 1977
and projections through 1986 for Regions I-XII, EMOS and ESVAL are available
in the project file and summarized in Annex 2 and 3. Consolidated results
are also summarized in Table 6.1.

6.06      The level of tariffs required for each of the regions varies accord-
ing to local conditions which affect the supply cost of water. Average
regional charges, including IVA, vary between US$0.12 and US$0.23/m3 in 1978
and are forecasted between US$0.13-US$0.60/m3 for 1982. Starting in 1979,
MOP's subsidies for SENDOS' operating costs (which amounted to US$10 million in
1978) were di continued and SENDOS started financing its investment program from
internal cash generation, borrowing and some special construction grants.
6.07      Given the present inadequacy of SENDOS' accounts, particularly with
regard to the valuation of existing assets, and the need to simplify project
supervision the proposed financial covenant for the National component is an
operating ratio before depreciation 1/ not exceeding 80% for 1981 and there-
after. This operating ratio, given the existing low levels of debt service,
would allow each region to pay its operating costs and debt service (including
the corresponding part of the Bank loan), and make an internal contribution
to capital works of 15-40% (Annex 11). This is achievable because of the
extensive past grant financing by the Government which results in low debt
service levels. Assurances were obtained from the Government and SENDOS during
negotiations that an operating ratio not exceeding 80% would be maintained
for each of its regional offices starting in 1981. Assurances were also
obtained from SENDOS that in general the revenues from each regional office
would be sufficient to cover its operating costs including a reasonable
portion of SENDOS' general administrative costs, and debt service and would
produce a positive rate of return on the revalued fixed assets of each region.
To this effect, SENDOS undertakes to complete, not later than June 30, 1982,
an initial revaluation of the fixed assets of its regional offices.
EMOS: Past Finances
6.08      The largest project component (87%) would benefit the population
of the Santiago Metropolitan Region and would be executed by EMOS. There is
little financial information previous to the establishment of EMOS in 1977 and
financial data is still not fully reliable. The comparative income statements
for 1976-78 (Annex 6, Table 1) show a considerable improvement in the opera-
tional surplus from -70% of revenues in 1976, to -18% in 1977, and 6% in 1978.
Water sales and meter maintenance fees constitute 73% of the operational
revenues, while installation fees and interest charges on overdue accounts
amount to 17%, and other miscellaneous charges 10% of total revenues. Total
projected non-tariff revenues are shown in Table 2 of Annex 6. The improvement
in EMOS' financial position is due to tariff increases of 165% in real terms
between 1976-79, higher water sales (15%) resulting from an increase in house
connections, and strict measures for cost control and efficiency of operation,
including a reduction in staff of 28% between 1977-79.
6.09      EMOS' operating costs are reasonable.  Personnel costs represent
31% of the total and EMOS is planning to continue increasing the efficiency
of its staff (para 3.17). The level of compensation for EMOS' personnel
1/   Operating costs (excluding depreciation) as a percentage of operating
revenues.



- 36 -
is fixed by a scale common to all public employees in Chile and is about
30% below the rate for comparable positions in the private sector. EMOS'
financial projections assume a salary increase in real terms of 15% between
1981-84. Energy costs (9.0%) would be reduced by 20% in real terms by 1982 by
reducing pumping and increasing the proportion of water delivered by gravity.
EMOS pays the value-added tax (IVA) charged to the consumers and paid to the
Government which is considerable and equals 47% of the project cost during
1980-84. Since 1979 EMOS is subject to income taxes, which would be about
45% of its net income. However accelerated depreciation rates (3.5% per year),
allowed by Chile's fiscal system, and higher than those used for financial
projections (2.5% per year) result in accounting losses which may be used to
defer taxes for the next three years. In the past, EMOS has been required to
transfer its cash surplus to the Government. The forecasted cash surplus in
1979-80 is large (about US$10 million) but would be required later for project
execution. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that EMOS would be
entitled to use as and when needed its cash surplus from operations in 1979
and during project execution to finance its approved investments.
6.10      The total revalued gross fixed water and sewerage assets, 1/ as of
December 31, 1978 are Ch$9,808.05 million (US$288.89 million), the accumulated
depreciation Ch$3,637.22 million (US$107.14 million), and the net value
Ch$6,170.83 million (US$181.76 million) (Annex 4). 2/ The total water and
sewerage assets indicate a ratio of US$505 per water connection or US$90
per person served, which is reasonable. The average depreciation rate of
2.5% per year, recommended by the feasibility report for financial projec-
tions, is acceptable. Assurances were obtained from EMOS during negotiations
that its fixed assets would be revalued annually in a proportion at least
equal to the corresponding variation of the Chilean Consumer Price Index,
published by the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica of Chile.
EMOS: Future Finances
6.11      During 1979 EMOS' tariffs were considerably improved, both in their
structure and level: the water charges were increased 15% in real terms
(to US$0.13/m3), including IVA taxes 3/ and sewerage charges (which were
introduced for the fi'rst time in Chile), tariff distortions were eliminated
and the level of excess consumption charges set above the incremental cost
of water. This tariff level, if adjusted by the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
will be adequate for EMOS' financial viability. However, the Ministry of
Economy temporarily suspended (in July 1979) an important revenue source
1/   Excluding assets donated by users.
2/   Study by the consultants, Bakovic and Balic-Ernst & Ernst concluded in
October 1978, and reviewed in May 1979. Copy available in project file.
3/   The principles governing IVA are as follows:  all operating revenues are
taxed 20% but the company pays to the Government only the difference
between the amount of IVA calculated on revenues and the amount of IVA
included in the invoices paid by the company to its suppliers and
contractors.

("aportes" or connection fees) pending an evaluation of the level and struc-
ture of these charges. Financial projections (Annex 3, Table 1) assume
no connection fees, and would then require a tariff increase of about 20% in
real terms between 1980-84. In practice, EMOS revenues would be obtained
through water tariffs, connection charges, other operating revenues (Annex 6,
Table 2), connection fees, and a higher percentage of sewerage charges (which
may increase from the present 13% to about 60% of water charges) during
project execution. An EMOS tariff study has been contracted with qualified
consultants, under terms of reference commented by the Bank, that would assess
the level and structure of all water and sewerage charges, their relation to
the marginal cost of water and to EMOS financial viability and would recommend,
by the beginning of 1981, the required changes. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that the Bank would have the opportunity to comment on
the recommendation of the EMOS tariff study not later than June 30, 1981.
6.12      EMOS' annual financial rate of return on revalued fixed assets
after taxes would be 3.0% in 1981, 4.0% in 1982-84, 4.5% in 1985 and 5.0%
thereafter (Annex 3). The effect of the cost reductions, higher efficiency,
inexpensive sources of water, and Low debt service make the maximum forecast
water and sewerage tariff level (US$0.17/m3 in 1980 prices, including IVA)
moderate in comparison with other Latin American cities. 1/ The proposed
rate of return would allow EMOS to have a net contribution of 79.2% to its
investments during 1980-84 (Table 6.2). This would be the highest internal
contribution for a Bank-financed water supply project. Assurances were
obtained from the Government and EMOS during negotiations that EMOS revenues
would be sufficient to obtain a rate of return on revalued fixed assets, after
IVA and all other taxes, not lower than 3.0% in 1981, 4.0% in 1982-84, 4.5%
in 1985 and 5.0% thereafter. The respective rate of return on revalued fixed
assets before the application of taxes, would amount to 7% in 1981, 9% in
1982-84 and about 10% thereafter (Annex 3). These rates are acceptable
because they agree with the marginal cost of water (para. 7.02) and would
result in a high internal cash contribution in relation to system expansion
costs.
6.13      EMOS' financial projections are shown in Annex 3.  The assumptions
for financial projections are described in Annex 13. EMOS' financial position
under these assumptions would be satisfactory. Its operating ratio before
depreciation would be below 67%, its debt service coverage ratio above 6,
and its debt/capitalization ratio below 6%.

including US$3.5 million of interest and other charges during construction on
the portion of the Bank loan relent to EMOS. Working capital needs during
project implementation are estimated at US$5.1 million. Works financed and
built by private developers are not included in the assets base or financing
plan. Other works by EMOS (US$26.7 million) are needed to meet the required
investments for sewerage extensions to accommodate some 40,000 new connections
and for the replacement of equipment and pipes and minor extensions to the
water distribution system. The total financing requirements of US$129.83
million would be provided as follows:
(a)  a proposed Bank loan of US$27.0 million to finance the foreign
exchange component of the project (26% of total project costs)
over a 15-year term with a three-year grace period, at an interest
rate of 8.25% p.a.; and
(b) net internal cash generation of US$102.83 million (79.2%).

6.16            After 1984, EMOS' financial position under the proposed covenant
would continue to be satisfactory and EMOS would be able to finance from
internal sources at least 80% of the forecasted investments (Annex 3, Table
2), including sewerage and sewage treatment works to improve service coverage
and to reduce pollution in the Maipo and Mapocho Rivers.
Financial Sensitivity Analysis
6.17            The projections shown in Annex 3 represent the most likely fore-
casted financial position. Nevertheless, general cost changes, demand reduc-
tions due to higher than forecasted elasticity, unforeseeable project cost
increases, or execution slippages may affect EMOS' financial viability. Under
normal conditions, at project conclusion in 1984, EMOS would have a cash
reserve of US$5 million, equivalent to 4.5% of the project cost. The sensiti-
vity analysis shows that EMOS' financial condition is manageable and that the
proposed covenant and resultant tariffs are satisfactory even under unforeseen
adverse conditions. Financial projections are sensitive primarily to tariffs,
then to project cost increases, and thirdly to lower water demand. The
effects on tariffs and on the rate of return covenant, as well as the effect
of different unfavorable assumptions on this cash reserve, are shown below:

Monitoring Indicators/Reporting Requirements
6.18      EMOS and SENDOS produce satisfactory monthly statistical reports on
key aspects of operation, finances, and project execution. EMOS' report will
include the monitoring indicators shown in Annex 3, Table 4. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that EMOS will send quarterly r ?orts to the
Bank, complemented by a brief description of progress in subproject implementa-
tion, and updated financial projections.
6.19      Assurances were also obtained during negotiations that SENDOS
would send quarterly updated consolidated project investment costs, regional
operating revenues and costs, operating ratios, volume sold, average tariffs
and basic information on subproject execution (cumulative number of master and
house connections, meters installed, percent meters installed, and percentage
number of staff, number of employees per thousand connections, length of pipe
surveyed in the leak detection program, and number of new chlorinators in
operation in each region).
6.20      Assurances were obtained during negotiations that, not later than
six months after project completion, SENDOS and EMOS would send to the Bank a
satisfactory completion report describing project execution, and the financial
and physical achievements and benefits.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Introduction
7.01      The economic benefits of a water supply project are necessarily
underestimated, as many benefits are not meaningfully quantifiable in monetary
terms, and others, for example, enhanced property values, cannot always be
attributed to the project alone. Some obvious project benefits, such as
improvements in public health and labor productivity, consumer surpluses,
increases in effective nutrition due to the reduction of intestinal parasites,
institution building, greater well-being of the population, and effects of the
tariff structure on the distribution of income and services are excluded here.
Therefore, the incremental rate of return (IRR) of the project (Table 7.1)
represents only a minimum proxy for the economic rate of return. The proposed
project supports Chilean efforts to accelerate the development of the water
supply sector, and is in agreement with Bank policies of raising the living
standards of the low-income population and of promoting institution building.
The project emphasizes not only the expansion of services to the population,
but also the application of sound financial policies, increased efficiency,
and the reduction of unnecessary costs and water wastage.

Incremental Rate of Return (IRR)
7.02      The EMOS project component is part of a comprehensive program to
improve the water supply sector in the Metropolitan Region and to serve all
of its inhabitants. The IRR of the project at the present level of tariffs is
12.4% (Table 7.1). 1/ The IRR is only moderately sensitive to increases in
the project cost; a 20% increase lowers the IRR to 10.4%. The combined effect
of a reduction of 10% in volume sold and an increase of 20% in project costs
would lower the IRR to 8.8%.
7.03      This IRR analysis does not include the costs or benefits of replac-
ing pipes or maintenance equipment, which would improve water pressure and
services to present consumers as well as providing benefits which are not
reflected by the incremental volume sold. In addition, pipe replacements
would avoid costly maintenance and provide reliable service. Nor does the
analysis cover the sewerage master plan study which is essential for the
orderly urban development of Santiago, and whose benefits are predominantly
non-quantifiable. Such components comprise 13% of the project cost.
7.04      The SENDOS National project component, although a relatively small
investment (US$15 million), aims at improving water supply services in dozens
of cities all over the country. The benefits of this project component are
non-quantifiable in practice, given the number of subprojects involved. The
benefits are summarized below:
(a)  health improvements in 36 cities, resulting from the project
objective of chlorinating 100% of all urban water supplies;
(b)  water waste reduction as a result of the installations of
about 167,000 meters. In addition, this program will help
postpone capital investments and allocate cost between users
in proportion to actual consumption;
(c)  reduction of production costs, control of losses, and improve-
ment of operations by metering water sources in 230 cities;
(d)  reduction of unaccounted-for water through a leak detection
and repair program of some 2,000 km of pipe in 11 cities.
This program is expected to reduce losses from the present
40-50% to about 25% by 1983, thus avoiding the need to expand
capacity, and reducing operating costs;
(e)  institutional improvements through a technical assistance program
to assist SENDOS to develop the organization and procedures to
decentralize and make more efficient the regional offices,
and provide the institutional capability to fulfill SENDOS'
target of serving 100% of the urban population by 1985.
1/   The incremental rate of return at the covenanted level of water
tariffs would be 14%.

Marginal Cost
7.05      The long-term marginal cost of water supply in Santiago at an 11%
discount rate is US$0.11/m3 1/ at 1980 prices (Table 7.2) which is 9% below
the January 1980 tariff (US$0.12 including IVA) and 27% below the maximum
forecasted tariff (US$0.15/m3, including IVA), which is satisfactory.
The tariff study under execution (para 6.03) is expected to result in more
progressive charges to discourage wastage and provide a more equitable dis-
tribution of charges to consumers and in proposing seasonal tariffs.
7.06      The Santiago subproject investment incremental cost is US$58 per
capita, which is below the average cost of about US$100 per capita for Latin
America in 1980.
Population Served and Impact on Poverty Groups
7.07      EMOS' target is to serve all its inhabitants through house connec-
tions, eliminating discrimination in the quality of service. Without the
project, the target to serve all of Santiago's inhabitants by 1984 is not
feasible and the population served through house connections would be reduced
from 90% in 1979 to 80% in 1985. At project completion (June 1985) the incre-
mental population benefitting from the Santiago project (Table 7.2) through
the installation of 122,500 house connections, would reach about 686,000
persons. From the limited information available on income distribution, it
is estimated that about 53% of the incremental population served belong to
the poverty group 2/ (persons with incomes below one-third of the country's
average per capita income). In the short run, the project is estimated to
benefit some 351,000 persons in the poverty group; in the long run, it is
designed to allow 1.86 million people to be served. The additional costs of
house connections to serve the future population would mainly be borne,
as is now the case, by users' payments to urban developers.
1/   Without considering those costs recovered directly through connection
fees.
2/   363,000 urban poor, 240,000 presently living in campamentos or satelites
plus about 23% within the normal population growth. According to the
ODEPLAN study (1970), about 33.8% of all Chileans living in extreme
poverty were in Santiago.

7.08      Most of Chile's urban population would benefit from the National
project component through improved services, lower water wastage, and reduced
costs. The direct beneficiaries of this project component are:

operating costs in 11 cities
and 8 regions)                              1,900                  400

investment planning in 230 cities)              760                 155
Affordability of Project Services
7.09      Present water and sewerage charges for minimum consumption (10 m3
in Santiago and all Chilean regions are less than one day's minimum salary,
a sum affordable by all the population (Annex 5). Even with the estimated
tariff increase in real terms mentioned in para 6.11, Santiago water would
continue to be affordable by the urban poor. The tariff study under execution
(para 7.03) would review the level of fixed and variable charges and the
affordability of water and more progressive charges are expected, keeping
minimum consumption charges affordable by the lowest income population.
Least-Cost Solution
7.10      The feasibility reports prepared by consultants and reviewed by
ODEPLAN and Bank staff include the analysis of least-cost solutions to meet
the water supply demand through house connections, according to population
expectations and Goverrment objectives. The project components are the least
cost alternatives at discount rates of between 8% and 17% (para 5.10).
Several project components do not have technological alternatives (tertiary
distribution systems, leak detection, house connections, etc.). In these
cases, the optimal timing, the design horizon, and staging of the solution
were given particular attention.

Risks
7.11      Given the simplicity of the works proposed and the advanced stage
of final designs and engineering, no particular risks related to the project
are foreseen, and the risk of not achieving the project objectives is low.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During loan negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Govern-
ment that:
(a)  the required counterpart funds for the National project component
estimated at about US$4 million would be internally generated
by SENDOS or provided by MOP budgetary allocations as needed
(para 5.14);
(b)  tariff adjustments for SENDOS regional offices would be
authorized to allow compliance with the provisions set
forth in para 8.02(b);
(c)  EMOS' revenues would be sufficient to allow compliance with
the provisions set forth in para 8.03(a);
(d)  the interest and principal of the Bank loan for the National
project component would be collected by MOP from the regional
offices or companies proportionally to their respective project
investments (para 5.14).
(e)  the Bank would have the opportunity to comment on any changes in
SENDOS' or EMOS' legal status (para 2.14);
(f)  EMOS' would be entitled to use as and when needed its cash surplus
in 1979 and during project execution to finance its approved
investments (para 6.09);
(g)  any corporation established to perform the functions of a SENDOS'
regional office shall be the legal successor to all rights
and obligations of such regional office under the Bank's
loan and project agreements (para 3.07);
(h)  as a condition of loan disbursements, subsidiary loan, agreements,
satisfactory to the Bank, will be signed with SENDOS and EMOS
(para 5.14); and
(i)  as a condition of loan disbursement for EMOS' Vizcachas Water
Treatment Plant component, the Bank shall be provided with
satisfactory evidence that EMOS is entitled to dispose of not
less than fifteen cubic meters of water per second from the
Maipo River (para 4.05).



- 47 -
8.02      During loan negotiations, assurances were obtained from SENDOS
that:
(a) the technical assistance and leak detection programs would be
executed by qualified consultants, whose selection and terms of
reference would be approved by the Bank (paras 2.14 and 5.15);
(b) tariff adjustments will be made in each regional office as
required to have an operating ratio (excluding depreciation) 1/
not exceeding 80% in 1981 and thereafter (para 6.07);
(c) that in general the revenues from each regional office would be
sufficient to cover its operating costs including a reasonable
portion of SENDOS' general administrative costs, and debt service
and would produce a positive rate of return on the revalued fixed
assets of each region. To this effort, SENDOS undertakes to complete,
not later than June 30, 1982, an initial revaluation of the fixed
assets of its regional offices.
(d) it would send to the Bank on a quarterly basis updated project
investment costs, regional operating revenues, costs and oper-
ating ratio, including basic information on subproject implemen-
tation on the number of master and house meters, length of pipe
surveyed in the leak detection program, and chlorinators installed,
number of staff and number of employees per thousand connections
(para 6.19);
(e) it would send to the Bank not later than six months after
project completion a satisfactory completion report describing
the execution of the project and its financial and physical
achievements and benefits (para 6.20);
(f)   starting in 1981, SENDOS' financial statements would be audited
annually by competent independent auditors satisfactory to the
Bank and in accordance with generally accepted accounting prin-
ciples, and that a certified copy of their report would be pre-
sented to the Bank not later than April 30 of the following
year (para 3.22); and
(g) it will take out or maintain insurance appropriate for the
water supply and sewerage sector in Chile (para 3.23).

8.03      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from EMiOS that:
(a) Its revenues would be sufficient to obtain a rate of return after
all taxes, on revalued fixed assets, not lower than 3% in 1981, 4%
in 1982-84, 4.5% in 1985, and 5% thereafter (para 6.12);
(b) EMOS' financial statements would be audited annually by competent
independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank and in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and a certified
copy of their report would be presented to the Bank not later
than June 30, 1981 for EMOS fiscal year ending December 31, 1980,
and not later than April 30 of the following years (para 3.22);
(c) fixed assets will be revalued annually in proportion equal
to the corresponding variation of the Chilean Consumer Price
Index (para 6.10);
(d) accounts receivable, net of a reasonable provision for bad debts,
would not exceed three months of billing by the end of 1980, and
two months in 1981 and thereafter (para 3.19);
(e)  it will send to the Bank for comments, not later than June 30,
1981, the recommendations of the technical assistance studies
on tariff, accounting, inventory management and income taxes
(para 3.13);
(f) it would send to the Bank on a quarterly basis a report with
the monitoring indicators shown in Annex 3, Table 4, a descrip-
tion of project implementation, and updated financial projections
(para 6.18);
(g) it would carry out under terms of reference satisfactory
to the Bank and the Borrower a study on the adequacy of its
insurance and would present the recommendations of this study
to the Bank for comments not later than December 31, 1981
(para 3.23);
(h) it would take out or maintain insurance appropriate for water
supply and sewerage operations in Chile (para 3.23);



- 49 -
(i)  as a condition of loan disbursements for the EMOS project com-
ponent, it would employ consultants acceptable to the Bank
to assist in the preparation of bidding documents, tender
analysis, and construction supervision (para 5.15);
(j)  the sewerage master plan and leak detection program would
be executed by qualified consultants, whose selection and
terms of reference would be satisfactory to the Bank
(para 5.15); and
(k)  it would send to the Bank not later than six months after
project completion a satisfactory completion report describing
the execution of the project and its financial and physical
achievements and benefits (para 6.20).
8.04      Provided the above conditions are met, the project would be suit-
able for a Bank loan of US$38 million. The loan would be for a period of
15 years including a grace period of three years.

WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
Demand
1.        For the Santiago Metropolitan Area, population estimates are based
on CELADE projections. 1/ The population served by EMOS excludes the muni-
cipalities of Maipu and Las Condes, which have independent services, and the
rural population within the metropolitan region. The population to be served
by EMOS was 3.54 million in 1978 and is estimated to reach 4.2 million by
1985. Population growth after 1985 is estimated at 2.29% per year.
2.        The population served in 1978 was 90.5% according to a users' census,
that is, 5.60 persons per connection, which is assumed to remain constant.
The population served is assumed to increase to 99% at the conclusion of the
project and remain at 99% after 1984.
3.        Average water consumption is based on actual data up to September
1979. It is assumed that the average consumption per connection which was
39.2 m3/month in 1979 would be reduced to about 37.5 m3/month due to price
elasticity in 1981 and will remain constant thereafter (para 5.18) and
that unaccounted-for water will drop from the present 33% to 25% by 1984
(para 4.16).
Financial Projections
4.         Financial projections are shown in dollar equivalent amounts.
Monthly results of costs or revenues are converted to dollars at the end
of each month and added to previous results. A general price increase of
11% is assumed for 1979, 10.5% in 1980, 9% in 1981-82 and 8% thereafter.
EMOS updated, with the post-appraisal mission of December 1979, its financial
projections based on the May 1979 accounting results available at the tiule.
5.        Water charges include consumption and meter maintenance charges
and are projected to obtain a rate of return on revalued fixed assets after
taxes of 3% in 1981, 4% in 1982-84, 4.5% in 1985, and 5% thereafter.
It is assumed that at least twice a year, tariffs will be reviewed and tariff
adjustments made as required to maintain the levels throughout each year.
A tariff increase in May 1979 of about 15% in real terms increased the average
tariff to US$0.13/m3 (including IVA). This tariff, maintained in real terms,
would be required to obtain the rates of return described above, provided
that the aportes or connection rights are maintained; however, as these charges
have been suspended while they are reevaluated, none have been assumed and the

CELADE, November 1976.

required tariff revenues are shown instead. Sewerage charges are now being
applied for about 13% of the water billing. The required revenues would be
a combination of higher sewerage charges, connection rights and water charges,
to be established by a tariff study being made by consultants.
6.        Other operating revenues include:
(a) Revenues from interest on reconnection fees (multas) which are
assumed to decrease 7% per year in real terms (maintained constant
at current prices) due to the projected progressive reduction
in interest rates;
(b) Connection fees from new installations for which the present
charge is US$120 per water connection and US$100 per sewerage
connection. Only 50% of these installations would be made and
their connection fee collected by EMOS. Actual collection
would only amount to about 80% of the total due to discounts
or exemptions made for the urban poor;
(c) Aportes or capital contributions for general works, which were
US$192 per connection in 1978, but were temporarily discontinued
in mid-79 pending further studies.
Operating Costs
7.        Operating costs exclude the value added tax (IVA) which is equivalent
to 20% of gross revenues (excluding aportes) and is shown separately.
8.        Personnel is assumed to be reduced to 2,200 employees by 1980 (down
from 2,900 in 1977), resulting in a ratio of 3.7 employees per thousand
connections in 1980 and thereafter. Although much of the reduction in personnel
is due to productivity increases, it is also partially due to hiring of
services (for example, meter reading) which have proven less expensive to
contract outside. Salary levels in the Chilean public sector may require an
increase of at least 30% to become competitive. However, this change is
likely to happen slowly. The assumption for salary increases in real terms is
12% in 1981, and 5% in 1984, with gradual increases of 0.8% in other years.
The change in salary levels is not considered a project cost for IFR calcula-
tions, but only the corresponding increment after the salary adjustments.
9.        The cost of chemicals is assumed to be proportional to the volume
of water produced and is adjusted for inflation.
10.       Energy costs are based on the projected reduction in kilowatts
resulting from the increase in gravitational flow, the forecasted water
production, the effect of the consultants' study to reduce energy charges
(especially demand) and the assumption that the present level of charges per
kwh will remain constant in real terms.
11.       Material costs are assumed to grow in proportion to 30% increase in
connections to take into account the effect of pipe and meter replacements
during project execution.

Page 3 of 4
12.       The cost of general materials and supplies is assumed to grow
2% in real terms.
13.       General administrative costs increased 87% in real terms in 1979 as
a result of the increase in services and consultants and is assumed to increase
with 70% of the growth in connections.
14.       Bad Debts.  EMOS has been implementing several measures to improve
collection (para 4.12); the results are partially satisfactory. Overdue
accounts for more than one year reached US$2.0 million by September 1979.
Therefore, bad debts are assumed to be 2.3% of revenues in 1979, and 2%
thereafter.
15.       EMOS, in accordance with Decrees 824 of 1974 and 2398 of November
1978, should pay 10% taxes of the income after depreciation, and 40% more of
the remainder after this tax and other deductions. However, the high depre-
ciation rates applied for fiscal purposes, the accumulated previous deficits
which are deductible for a period of five years, and the revaluation losses
(capital is larger than fixed assets) would result in no payment of income
taxes up to 1982. Furthermore EMOS has paid taxes in advance (estimated at
US$4.8 at end 1979) which would be deducted later and has hired an income
tax consultant to study its income tax burden.
Balance Statements
16.       Cash.  Minimum level of cash is about one month of personnel costs.
17.       Accounts Receivable.  The values shown are net of bad debt reserves
(para 14) and are assumed to be 90 days in 1980 and to be reduced to 60 days
of billing by 1981.
18.       Taxes Paid in Advance.  Amount collected by Government taxes;
assumed to remain constant (para 15).
19.       Inventories.  Include materials and tools and are assumed to be
maintained in real terms until 1980, and to increase 2-3% in real terms
thereafter.
20.       Other Assets.  Maintained in real terms.
21.       Fixed Assets.  Based on the physical inventory made by Bakovic and
Balic on December 31, 1978 and sanctioned by 1978 Government audit and the
Ministry of Economy and do not include those assets donated by developers
or users (para 6.10), which have financed about 20% of fixed assets.
Consumer contributions are excluded from assets and depreciation for rate
of return calculations.
22.       Accounts Payable.  Are projected as a percentage of operating costs
excluding salaries and energy. The 20% level in 1978 is assumed to reach a
stable level of 15% by 1980.
23.       Contractors' Payable.  About 15-30 days of annual investments.
24.       Taxes and Social Benefits Payable.  Projected at 8% of salaries.
