PREFACE
1.       The following  is  a  Project  Completion  Report  on  the Seventh
Highway Project in Colombia for which Loan 1471-CO, in the amount of
US$90.0illion, was approved by the Board on June 28, 1977. After a
period of six onths beyond the final Closing Date granted to finalize
disburesm_nts, the loan account was closed leaving an undisbursed balance
of US$2,170,000 which was cancelled. The Government and the Bank agreed to
include incomplete components and/or uncomplied conditions under the
follow-up operation (Loan 2121-CO).
2.       This Coanletion Report wv    prepared  by  the Bank's Latin America
and the Caribbean Regional Office and is based on information obtained from
the LAC Information Center, Appraisal and Supervisions Reports for Loan
1471-CO. and a final report prepared by the Borr' er, the Ministry of
Public Works and Transport.
3.      In accordance with the revised procedures for project
performance reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation
Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff. The
draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on August 8, 1988. The comments
received from the Borrower are reproduced as an Annex to the PCR.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COT O3BIA
SEVENTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
LOAN 1471-CO
EVALUATION SUtMARY
1.       The Seventh  Highway  Project  (Loan  1471-CO)  partially  achieved its
objectives which consisted in rehabilitating parts of the main highways,
eliminating  the  damaging  effects   of  overloading  vehicles,  improving  the
efficiency of maintenance operations, including the highway maintenance fleet,
and improving transport sector management.    The  project  consisted of:  (a) a
rehabilitatioa program of about 978 km of trunk aaphalt-paved roads, including
supervisions (b) a vehicle weight control program: (c) a highway maintenance
program Sd) assistance in transport managements and (e) logistic support for
project execution. The scope of the rehabilitation program was later reduced,
the vehicle weight coutrol  program  and  som  of  the  studies included in the
project  had  to  be  postponed   to   be   completed  under  later  loans,  and
implementation  of  the  recommendations   from   the  technical  assistance  in
maintenance management and institutional strengthening 'wer not implemented
satisfactorily.
2.       Final total project cost with  the  revised scope of the rehabilitation
program and cancellation of the vehicle weight control component rose to
US$187.1 million, about 211 above  the  appraisal estimate of US$154 million for
the total original project, mainly due to cost intreases of the road
rehabilitation  works  resulting  from  poor  designs,  inadequate  contractors'
capacity, shortage of funds to sustain technicallr conceived schedules, slow
procurement procedures and unforeseen road deterioration which took place
between the time when the designs were completed and the works' execution
actually started. The cost increase required'additional allocation of funds in
the Government's 198l, 1982 and 1983 budgets.
3.       In October 1983, the Bank  accepted  MOPT's request to reduce the scope
of the civil works component from 978 km to 777 kw of roads and to finance the
balance under Loan 2121-CO (April  1982).    The reduced component was completed
and fully disbursed. After the reduction in scope of the civil works component
from 978 to 777 km, the final cost of rehabilitation works including supervision
totalled US$159.3, about 402 above the appraisal estimate of US$113.9 million
for the original scope of this  component.    The main reasons for this increase
weret (a) additional work quantities to correct deficiencies in sections which
had been completed before the designs were revised, and those resulting from
such revision, once completed, to take into account the deterioration of roads
in the period elapsed between completion of engineering and actual start-up of
work execution; and (b) higher-than-anticipated price escalation due to low and
over-extended work implementation schedules.



- vi -
4.       The quality of executed rehabilitation  works has not been satisfactory
because of premature damage caused by insufficient thickness of pavement
structure. Inadequate maintenance and extended exposure of unprotected black
bases to traffic wear further contributed to accelerated deterioration. The
Bank's letter of July 10, 1983 recommended remedial as well as preventive
actions for future works.   HOPT  failed  however  to  act fully upon the Bank's
recommendations.
5.       Execution of the  vehicle  weight  control  program was cancelled after
several years of delay due to:   (a) slow contracting and execution of the study
to develop appropriate vehicle weight and dimensions and establish control
systems  (the  final  report   was   eventually   produced  in  December  1983);
(b) repeated delays in procurement of the weighing scales (several unsuccessful
bidding and negotiation attempts).   Finally,  it  was agreed that five portable
weighing scales would be acquired under Loan 2121-CO, and procurement of fixed
weigh-in-motion scales would be included in the program to be financed under the
Second Highway Sector Project, Loan 2829-CO (June 1987).
6.       Technical assistance for the Road Maintenance Program was providedtby a
French consulting firm and completed in January 31, 1982. A complete set of
documentation was proposed and a large group of engineers were trained to carry
out systematic maintenance of the national network (about 25,000 km). One area,
however, where the consultants fell short of addre sing satisfactorily the
problem was in spare parts administration.   Sustainability and follow up on the
recoinndations of this technical assistance program have been poor. The
programs which were to be implemented at the level of the districts as part of
the maintenance management system were not executed satisfactorily; part of the
staff trained has been disbanded, establishment of required controls has been
slow, flow of information remains unreliable. equipment. management has not
improved, and finally, expenditures appropriated for highway maintenance
decreased in real terms and continued to be used in an inefficient manner. All
of these problems have been discussed, to little avail, between the Bank and
successive administrations.
7.       Road maintenance equipment and some office support elements for US$23.0
million were procured with several years delay. Additionally, MOPT purchased
maintenance equipment for about US$61.0 million with suppliers' credits.
8.       The National Transport Plan, preparation  of which was a loan covenant,
was submitted to the Bank with three years' delay. It was later updated under
Loan 2121-CO. The effort had limited impact because the exercise was largely
descriptive, and neither analytically nor policy-oriented.
9.       The road materials  inventory  was  successfully  completed in 1984 and
provided comprehensive information for maintenance and construction. Updating
of information has been inconsistent and unreliable and, therefore, the use of
the system is becoming  more  constrained.    MOPT  is to take corrective action
under Loan 2829-CO.
10.      The component for technical assistance to train managerial staff of the
construction industry, which was introduced in 19aO after a recommendation made
by the Bank, was not carried out.    The sensitive nature of such assistance and
the uncertainty as to whether it would correctly address a major issue, caused
successive administrations at MOPT to delay its implementation. The component
was finally cancelled under this project and transferred to Loan 2121-CO.



. vil -
11.      Two principal lessons are derived  from  this  project.  A first one is
the need to have in  place,  particularly  when  the loan is of the se.tor-type,
sufficiently  developed   programing   and   monitoring   capacity.    Adequate
prograaing and monitoring of engineering studies, procurement procedures and
implemntation activities are sine-qua-non conditions for satisfactory quality
and costs of work. Thie integration of physical and financial programming, and
the subsequent monitoring need to be  effectively practiced.  Timely payment for
work performed is also key as otherwise MOPT, as it happens, is not able to
enforce contractors to comply with agreed work schedules. This, in turn, causes
unduly long delays, increases costs due to time-related cost contingencies and,
when occurring systematically, leads the contractors to acquire obligations
beyond their actual capacity.   A  second  lesson  is  for the Bank which should
review and obtain a good and clear understanding of issues before proposing
solutions which may not address properly the problems, not be entirely
acceptable to the borrower or be unattainable within a reasonable period. The
lowering of the loan disbursement percentages at a time when MOPT was suffering
a budget crunch; the late inclusion in the project's scope of a component to
train managers of civil engineering contracting firms; the readiness to relieve
MOP? from complying with loan covenants, exemplified in the more than three-
years extension of the Loan Closing Date and the transferring of obligations to
follow-up  projects,  are  actions  which   atteat   to  the  need  for  careful
understanding of the problems.

COLOMBIA
SEVENTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
LOAN 1471-CO
I. INTMODUCTION
1.01     Colombia has a road  network  totalling  about 104,000 km:  25,000 km
form the national highway system under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of
Public Works end Transportation (MOP?); a further 52,000 km are under the
responsibility of the Departmentas and 27,000 km are managed by the National
Rural Roads Fund (lNCV).   In  the  early 19503, Colombia's largely regionally
oriented transport network began to evolve into a national system, in response
to economic' growth  requirements.    By  the  early  1960s, the basic skeletal
structure of the Western Trunk Road (Cartagena-Medellin-Cali-Pasto), the
Eastern  Trunk  Road  (Santa   Marta-Bucaramanga-Bogota-Niva)  and  two  main
transverse roads connocting the Eastern end Western trunk roads were opened to
traffic, but not fully upgraded or paved.
1.02     The  Bank  has  had  an  instrumental  role  In  the  development  of
Colombia's transport sector.   Since  1951  and  prior  to the Seventh Highway
Project, it lent a total of US$136.0 million equivalent for the road
subsector.   These  projects  helped  to  develop  the  basic national highway
network, with the Seventh Highway Project focusing upon the reh ailitation of
the paved trunk roads and the improvemeat of MOPT' s capabilities to maintain
the national highway system. Subsequently, the Bank financed a First Highway
Sector Project (Loan 2121-CO, US$152.3 million, May 13, 1982) aimed at
improving subsector planning and project implementation.. A Second Highway
Sector Project was approved by the Board on June 9, 1987. It includes, inter
alia, a policy reform and institutional improvement action Plan that would
support the strengthening of MOPT's policy-making and management capabilities.

II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION. PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01     The Government proposed a Seventh  Highway  Praject in August 1971 to
support construction, reconstruction and upgrading of specific road sections.
2.02     Due to the Governmeit's increasiag  concern  with the need to improve
road maintenance practices, the proposed project was designed to place
substantial emphasis upon assisting the Government in protecting the capital
stock in highways, thus avoiding future costly reconstruction of roads. The
project was to:   (a) rehabilitate  parts  of  the  main trunk highway srstem;
(b) impl eme nt a program to reduce vehicle overloading; (c) improve the



conditiona and availability of the highway maintenance equipmnt fleet;
(d) improve  efficiency  of  road   maintenz'ae  operations;  and  (e) improve
transport planning.
2.03     To achieve its objectlves, the project consisted of:
Part A
A rehabilitation program (712) including about 978 km of trunk
asphalt paved roads, and comprising improvement of terrain
stability and drainage, strengthening and widening of the
roadway, where necessary, and overlaying the existing pavement,
as well as supervision of civil works by consultant firms and
coordination of the program by HOPT;
Part B
A vehicle weight  control  program  (62)  including a study and
installation of about 20 weighing stations on main trunk roads,
and training in their use, and supervision of civil works and
equipment installation by consultants;
Part C
A highway maintenance  progras  (21S)  including acquisition of
about 800 units of equipment, spare parts for overhaul and
preventive  maintenance,  workshop  av4  store  extensions  and
technical assistance including training, all in support of
improved  methods   for   highway   maintenance  and  equipment
utilization;
Parc D
Studies (l2) for transport sector planning; and
Part E
Logistic support equigmsnt (l2) such as vehicles, road marking,
laboratory and drilling equipment.
2.04     The rehabilitation program evolved from a survey carried out in 1973
by a French consulting firm under the Fifth Highway Project, Loan 550-CO
(July 1968), which showed that bout 1,700 km of the 6,500 km paved national
highway network required urgent rehabilitation. The road maintenance program
was largely developed by HOPT  and  Bank  staff.    The original scope of the
project, however, had to be reduced in view of financial constraints imposed
by increasingly higher cost estimates; final designs were produced before
loan negotiations for the rehabilitation of 978 km.
2.05     The vehicle weight control component of the project evolved from the
assessment by HOPT and the Bank of the major factors responsible for the
rapid deterioration of the roads and, hence, of the major road rehabilitation
effort needed. Preliminary analysis to estimate the number and location of
the weighing stations required was done by MOPT in the course of project



-3-
preparation, and a three-phase study to develop a comprehensive enforcement
prograa was carried out by consultants under the project. The first phase
was an assessunt of the esiiting vehicle weight and dimension regulations;
the second phase consisted in defining the most suitable system, including
equipment for weight control and enforcement; and the third phase included
final designs and bid documents for procurement of civil works and weighing
equipmnt.
2.06     The Highway Maintenance Program of the project included introduction
of improved equipment, workshop and store management procedures; purchase of
equipment and  spare  parts;  and  technical  assistance.    The  emphasis on
equipment utilization and mana8ement of workshops and stores resulted from
the work of a UNID01' team (financed by UNDP) that had assisted MOPT iince
1973 in equipment maintenance and utilization. The equipment and spare parts
purchase program was based upon an assessment of MOPT's equipment fleet
carried out by a Bank consultant *as part of the project's appraisal. The
technical assistance component was designed to be an extension of the ongoing
UNIDO program and reflected a joint assessment, by MOPT and the Bank, of the
advisory services required to carry out needed improvement in equipment and
store management and in the programming and executing road maintenance
operations.    Rather  than   concentrating   on  general  analysis  of  road
maintenance procedures, the technical assistance was oriented to provide on-
the-job training through direct involvement in all critical aspects of
maintenance operations, especially those for paved roads.
2.07     For this project, two  conditions    were  complied with:  completed
engineering for the loan negotiations, and stated recognition or the
importance  of  road  Haintewace        fowever,  and  with  hindsight, project
preparation failed to asisess realistically MOPT's executing capacity and
commitment to carry out the envisaged project scope.
2.08     The initial estimated  cost  of  th.' project  was USS153.75 million
equivalent. Foreign exchange expenditures we Se estimated at US$90.75 million
or about 592 of the total project cost; the Bank agreed to finance US$90
million with the loan. The table in the following page shows the breaLlown
of the cost estimates and financing af the project as originally appraised.

Highway Project (Loan 550-CO) to be completed in 1975, three years after the
original completion date,Z and for the Sixth Highway Project, Loan 680-CO
(Hay 1970) to make some progress,3 negotiations were held in Washington in
May 1977, and the loan was approved by the Board of Directors on June 28,
1977.
III, IMPLEMENTATION
Road Rehabilitation Program
3 01     This component,  contracts  for which  were  awarded  following ICB
procedures to firms that had been prequalified in MOPT's Registry of
Contractors, including foreign firma, suffered substantial delays almost from
the start. The main reasons for these delays were MOPT's cumbersome bidding

Audit Report dated Febriary 27, 1978.

disbursed in July 1980.    Project  Completion report dated October 29,

and contracting procedures and the fragpentation and complexity of the
administrative steps between contract award and payment of advances. These,
in turn, caused significantly higher cost estimates exacerbating budgetary
constraints and leading to extremely slow implementation which required, in
October 1983, a retduction of the size of this component.
3.02     Civil  works  started  in  1980  with  an  initial  scope  of 978 km
comprising 33 contracts and supervision carried out by consultants selected
according to Bank Guidelines. The poor quality of the original designs which
were prepared by consultants and clearly not supervised by MOPT, and the
additional deterioration of the roads to be rehabilitated in the period
eLapsed between completion of the engineering and actual start-up of project
execution, required later revision of the designs and resulted in higher base
costs. The whole situation was aggravated by the extension of the execution
period and the  consequent  effect  of  price  escalation.    The severe cost
inrzeasse, coupled to insufficient budget funding, induced the Bank to
reduce, in May 1982, the disbursement percentage for civil works from SO to
202, in what was considered an effort to ensure the Bank's participation
through project completion.    This  action  required MOPT to unrealistically
increase the counterpart funding with its own resources. The Government was
unable to provide the additional funds (as it already had proven unable to
provide for the original cost sharing arrangeoent), and project execution was
delayed even further. In October 1983, the Bank agreed to reduce the civil
works component to 776 km and to provide the financing needed to complete the
-riginal scope of works under the follow up Highway Sector Project, Loan
2121-CO, reinstating disbursements under this category to the origiral 502.
3.03     Delays of work in  progress,  some attributable to poor contractors'
performance but mostly due to MOPT's insufficient funding, caused not only
further cost overruns but also damage to work which had already been
accomplished but not  completed.    Moreover,  the  existing pavement in some
sections was not sufficiently strong and suffered structural and superficial
fractures beyond those identified at the tim the rehabilitation designs were
carried out. Henceforth, the original designs not only had insufficient
capacis; to bear the traffic, but deterioration was exacerbated by MOPT's
inability  to  carry  out  maintenance   prior  to  execution  of  works  and
subsequently enforce the contractors' maintenance obligation during the
excessively extended  execution  periods.    This  inability  as  well as the
inadequacy of the original designs were also evident on road sections where
works had been finalized prior to revision of designs and corrective actions.
Some districts received roads to be maintained which were already defective
from the outset. In some cases, the quality and sequence of construction
activities followed during execution of works was inadequate and also
evidenced the inadequacy of supervision efforts; for example, asphalt carpets
were placed along some road sections without prior corrective work to the
base which had long been exposed and had deteriorated.
3.04     Under the revised  project  scope,  civil  works  were completed and
funds were fully disbursed by January 1985. Completion of the revised works
scope required two and a half years longer than initially planned under the
original scope.



-6-
Vehicle Weight Control Program
3.05     Based upon the first phase  of  a  study  carried out by a Colombian
consultant in 1978, MOPT recoumended increasing the miniua load allowed from
8.2 tons to 9.3 tons for single azles, and from 14.5 tons to 17.5 tons for
tandea axles. Measures outlining regulations to enforce compliance with axle
loads were also recoemended.
3.06     The second phase of the study financed under the loan and contracted
in November 1980 with the same Colombian firm that had carried out the first
phase, covered the determination of a suitable system of weight control and
enforcement, the location of stations and method of weight control and othefr
operational requirements and the definition of the equipment most suited to
the purpose.   The  composition  of  the  truck  fleet and import regulations
limiting vehicle dimnaions were also reviewed. fowever, due to lack of
interest from the Governmeat, the program suffered long delays. These delays
were exacerbated by changes in MOPT's administratLon, indecLsion in defining
the plans of actLon and the unusually long tim required for awarding and
legalizLng the consultants' contracts.
3.07     A more extensive second  phase  program presented by the consultants
ln February 1982 was consldered inappropriately large and was scaled down to:
a) the installatLon of three comblnad dynamic-static scales to be operated at
key locations covering 80S of long dLstance heavy trafflc, and of three
static scales at international crossLng points; b) procurement of portable
scales for auxiliary control; and c) enactment of modifications of the
existing legislation and procedures for implementatLon of the weight control
system, and for control of weight and measureoents of imported or locally
assembled freight vehicles. The speciflc plan (third phase) of action for
installing the scales at stations and operating and enforcing axle load
control was prepared by MOPT and presented to the Bank during negotiations of
the follow-up project, Loan 2121-CO.   Operation of the weLghing scales which
was agreed wnuld start by December 31, 1983, continues to be delayed due to
problems in the bldding and procurement processes.
3.08     The project'sclosing date, which had to be postponed several times,
was supposed to allow HOPT inter alia to solve the procurement problems faced
in relation to thls component.   By December 31, 1985, the final loan closing
date, the contracts had stlll not been signed and lt was agreed that this
component would be carried out under the following projects. After a period
of six months granted to finalize pending disbursements, on June 30, 1986,
the loan account was closed leaving an undisbursed balance of US$2,170,000.
HiLhway Maintenance Program
3.09     The objective pursued by  the  Project of improving road maintenance
under MOPT was not accomplished basically because of lack of comaitment from
the  Government.    Both   budgeted   and  actual  expenditures  for  highway
maintenance decreased, in real terms, during the project implementation
period and until 1985, not complying  with agreed target levels.  The problem
was compounded by the lack of adequate measures to compensate the shortage of
funds by building-up  the  maintenance  organization, becomang cost-effective
and ensuring that the limited funds were actually being spent on highway
maintenance. The availability of budgeted funds somewhat improved ln later



-7-
years; not so the effectiveness of MOPT. The project supported maintenance
through provision of consultants' technical assistance services and purchase
of new equipmnt and spare parts for repairs of existing equipment. Delays
in the appointment of technical assistance consultants, slow analysis of bids
and slow finalization of contract documents for purchase of spare parts,
which in turn delayed equipment repairs, accounted for most of the program's
slippage.   The purchase of new equipment lagged a year behind schedule.
3.10     The  first  step  taken   towards   implementation  of  the  highway
maintenance program was the contracting of a French consultant firm in 1980
to identify the needs and establish a plan of action for this program, and to
provide technical assistance on road maintenance. Such technical assistance
was expected to lead MOPT to develop and implement a pavement management
system, an equipment and spare parts management system and a training system.
The technical assistance contract ended by January 1982.
3.11     Based  upon  the  technical  assistance  recomendations,  MOPT  was
expected to carry out the reorganization of purchasing, warehousing and
distribution procedures for spare  parts.    However, implementation of these
institutional strengthening components was delayed for years, first awaiting
the introduction of computerized monitoring systems, and later expecting that
internal divergencies between different MOPT departments involved be solved.
Implementation has now been shifted in time and scheduled in the action
program agreed under the latest operation, Loan 2829-CO.
3.12     In 1982,  HOPT  started  implementing  some  recommendations  of the
French consultants regarding pavement and equipment management in four of the
regional districts. Subsequently, the syutem was to be extended to other
HOPT districts by 1984.   However,  by  1985,  MOPT had totally neglected the
maintenance program recommended by the French consultant and the team of
local staff which had specially been trained for that purpose was split and
assigned to other unrelated tasks.
3.13     For the procurement of maintenance equipment, MOPT initially focused
on purchases of support equipment such as mobile workshop and lubrication
units to improve preventive maintenance of the fleet. Eventually, seven
hundred and thirty-two units of maintenance equipment and vehicles, including
spare parts, were purchased by MOPT under the project following ICB
procedures, and a further 1,413 units were purchased through supplier credits
(for ehout US$61.0 million).
Studies for Highway Engineering and Management
(i) Inventory of Locally Available Road Materials.
3.14     A preliminary study was  financed  by  FONADE.   The subsequent main
Bank-financed study was conceived as, and divided into three contracts.
Three different local firms were each awarded one contract covering a
specific geographic area. Information was compiled on location and available
quantities of materials complying with road construction specificatiora, and
made available to all interested Road Directorates and District Offices of
HOPT. The study provided comprehensive information but was not subsequently
updateds quantities of materials used from different sources was not
consistently and reliably recorded, and therefore the data have become



-8-
partially obsolete. Under the last project approved, Loan 2829-CO, MOPT is
required to update and complement this study.
(ii) Medellin-RIo Negro Access Road.
3.15     Local consultants were contracted in  January 1981 to undertake this
Bank-financed feasibility study (US$0.25  million).   With Bank-financing the
new airport of Medellin was being constructed, but the airport loan did not
provide for studies of the new  access  road.    A contract was signed with a
local consultant following the review and analysis of proposals submitted by
three previously short-listed  firms,  all  from  Colombia.   Ten alternative
roads were studied by the consultant who was awarded the contract. A
detailed engineering study was later completed in February 1982 for the
solution prefered by  MOPT.    As  this  solution  involves construction of a
costly tunnel, no final decision has as of now been m=de.
(iii) Professional Management Training Prosram for Contractors.
3.16     A  1980  Bank  mission  to  study  performance  of  the Construction
Industry in Colombia recomended inclusion in this project of a component for
training of related managerial  staff.    It was agreed that USS0.44 million
would be financed with loan funds.    Terms  of reference were agreed in 1981
and a French consultant firm was selected. However, in 1982 the incoming new
administration decided, with Bank's acquiescence, that this effort would be
better carried out through assistance from local universities. During the
following four years two further unsuccessful attempts were made to contract
this technical assistance with a joint venture between a Colombian consulting
firm, a French one, and  a  local  university.    The sensitive nature of the
assistance, and the doubts as to its adequacy to address the issue caused
successive administratios at MOPT to hesitate and delay its implementation.
Nothing had been accomplished by the loan closing date when this component
was cancelled. Again, it was decided that this component be financed under
the follow-up project, Loan 2121-CO.
Logistic Suoport Equipment
3.17     This component was partially carried out:  vehicles were procured to
support the execution of the Rehabilitation and Maintenance Programs as well
as laboratory, road striping and pavement deflection and roughness measuring
equipment. Equipment procurement was carried out by ICB; spare parts for
specific makes of existing equipment were procured requesting quotations from
established dealers. Boring and testing equipment were not purchased with
loan proceeds because the evaluation of responsive bids and the award
recommendation made by MOPT were inconsistent with the Bank's guidelines on
procurement. MOPT finally decided to rent this equipment.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
4.01     As stated in the  completion  report  for the Sixth Highway Project,
Loan 680-CO (October 29, 1980), the reorganization of MOPT, carried out in
1976, had in the beginning little effect in overcoming MOPT's management
deficiencies, and it was not until a new Government took over in 1978 that



-9-
improvnments became apparent.    Effective  start-up  of  the Seventh Highway
Iroject was aelayed for two years because of cnange in administration and in
HOPT'. practices, which delayed most procurement actions for almost a year.
Key consultants became  involved  only  in  1980.    Some  of the civil works
initiated during the first two years encountered administrative, technical
and financial problems, and failed; new contracts had to be negotiated or
retendered. It was not until the end of 1979 that project execution really
began to get underway.
4.02     Subsequent project execution was  affected by insufficiencies in the
original designs and the additional deterioration that occurred in the period
elapsed  between  engineering  completion  and  actual  start-up  of  project
execution on the roads to be  rehabilitated.  MOPT's regulatory and budgetary
constraints  contributed  to  inefficient   implementation  of  the  project,
compounded by the weak performance of some contractors. However. euccessive
HOPT   administrations,   particularly    after   1983,   impro-ved   contract
administration and project execution, and agreed with the Bank on the
reduction of the scope of the civil works component which allowed completion,
albeit late. 
4.03     ;mplementation of an effective  highway maintenance program was also
impaired, despite budgetary increases, by ths delay in contracting the
required technical assistance and by HOPT's weakness in following up on the
recomsendations of the  technical  assistance.    Execution  of the equipment
procurement program, of the vehicle weight control program and of the
different  technical  studies  were   also   hampered  by  HOPT's  cumbersome
procurement procedures and by frequent changes in criteria of successive
administrations.
V. COST ESTIMATES AND DISBURSEMENTS
5.01     The final cost  of  US$187.07  million  is  21.72  above the initial
estimate of $153.75 million, even with the project scope reduction and the
fact that several components were not completed. This increase in costs with
respect to appraisal  estimates  was  mostly  due  to underestimated costs at
appraisal, and cost overruns due to delays and higher quantities of civil
works elements.    The  Highway  Rehabilitation  Program  experienced  a cost
increase of 46C despite the 202 scope reduction because of the reasons given
in para. 3.02. The Road Maintenance Program was unable to use, before the
loan closing date, the funds allocated and the equivalent of the programmed
price contingencies was then reallocated to finance the cost increases of the
highway rehabilitation civil works.    The Highway Engineering and Management
Studies experienced a cost increase of 742, mainly because they required much
more time and effort than  originally  envisaged.  The physical component for
vehicle weight control as not carried out and that of logistic support was
only partially implemented.
5.02     Disbursements lagged about 18 months behind appraisal estimates from
the start and during the first five years (1979-83), when 85? of the loan was
disbursed. The remaining 15 was slowly disbursed, as shown in the following
tabulation, reflecting the slow pace of the construction works and
the considerable delays in completing thems

a/ About 2.2 million were cancelled.
V'. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
6.01     The Seventh Highway Project  was  justified  at appraisal, mainly on
the basis of quantifiable benefits accruing to road users from reduced
vehicle operating costs and travel time which would result from improvements
in road conditions.
Highway Rehabilitation Program
6.02     Following the same approach used at appraisal, but applying a state-
of-the art methodology to calculate vehicle operating costs, every one of the
33 civil works contracts was analyzed separately to estimate its ex-post ERR.
An assessment was also made of the ex-post ERR corresponding to the Road
Rehabilitation Program as a whole.
6.03     For each contract  economic  benefits  from  user  cost savings were
calculated, mainly vehicle operating and passenger travel time cost savings
resulting from the rehabilitated road sections, over a 10-year period of
service life. The basic inputs used in the analysis weret (a) MOPT's actual
traffic counts up to 1986 and future (beyond 1986) estimates of traffic
volume and vehicle composition; (b) physical characteristics (predominantly
roughness condition) of the road, once rehabilitated and also without
rehabilitation taking place; (c) actual capital expenditures including
supervision; and (d) estimates of the value of time saved by passengers
riding vehicles on  each  road  section.    The  streams  of  annual cost and
benefits were expressed in constant 1985 US$.
6.04     Table 2 shows the investment  costs,  traffic volumes and ERRs whlch
were estimated at appraisal and obtained ex-post for each contract and the
whole rehabilitation program.   The  comparison,  which shows generally lower
ERRs than those originally expected is not entirely valid due to the use of a
significantly different vehicle operating cost methodology. Actual traffic



- 11 -
volumes are generally lower than those estimated at appraisal, and capital
costs are substantially higher. In this respect, it must be pointed out,
once again, that financing had to be provided from the follow-up loan (Loan
2121-CO)  to  complete   the   physical   targets   (and  contracts)  of  the
rehabillitation  progrm.    Twenty-nine  of   the  33  highway  sections  are
nevertheless proven economic as well as the overall program. The ERR for the
overall rehabilitation program is 231.
Highway Maintenance Program
6.05     For the  maintenance  component,  of  which  the  loan  financed the
purchase of equipment, spare parts and laboratory elements, as well as
technical assistance, no es-post economic evaluation was possible for lack of
basic information on the presumably better maintained national network.
VIl.   ROLE OF TUE BANK
7.01     Although an average of 2.5 supervision missiouls were carried out per
year, this effort was not sufficient given the complesxity of the project, the
country wide distribution of the project works and HOPT's deep-rooted
weakness in dealing with all the technical and administrative difficulties
encountered. The Bank showed fleziLility in agreeing to changes in scope and
time extensions, and in incorporating in following loans, those components
and conditions which were not met under the Seventh Highway Project. This
grolling over of loan obligations, also carried out under previous loans
may however have contributed to weaken MOPT's perception and understanding of
priorities and loan conditionality;
7.02     The Bank's major contribution  was  to  help the Borrower focus upon
the need for institutional strengthening to allow for more efficient
implementation procedures, avoiding future delays in contracting and payments
which caused most of the Project'. cost and time overruns. The First (Loan
2121-CO) and Second Highway Sector (Loan 2829-CO) Projects continue to pursue
institutional improvements.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01     The project was not  fully  successful  in  meeting the objective of
rehabilitating 978 km.  about 200 km were  transferred to be completed under
Loan 2121-CO.   Nevertheless,  the  rehabilitated  roads  are benefitting the
economy by reducing vehicle operating costs, extending the useful life of
past capltal expenditures, and providing adequate and safe levels of service
to users.
8.02     The vehicle weight control program  has  a high priority to the road
transport industry. However, the scales and equipment were not purchased and
the component had to be cancelled by the Bank. At present, the contract for
five portable scales has just been completed under Loan 2121-CO.
8.03     Although the  physical  portion  of  the  maintenance  component was
completed (equipment and spare parts were purchased as planned), the
institutional strengthening  objective  was  not  achieved.    Low Governmnt



- 12 -
co  itmnt and interest  in  the  project  were  key  factors contributing to
reduce the impact of the technical assistance, hinder acquisition of vehicle
weighing scales and not monitor actual maintenance performed and its cost-
efftct4veness.
8.04     The Project's short-falls show that HOPT needs further institutional
strengthening to improve its management capabilities in key areas, viz:
(a) Preparation of engineering studies;
(b) procurement and contracting procedures;
(c) administration of contracts;
(4) planning, budgeting and finencial controls;
(e) road maintenance administration including cost-based budgeting
for routine maintenance works;
(f) pavement and equipment management systems;
(h). information systems; and
(i) personnel training.
Tosue broad areas are being addressed by the subsequent First and Second
Highway Sector Projects (Loans 2121-CO and 2829-CO).

Subject: Project Completion Report
Seventh Highway Project
Loan L471-CO
Dear Mr. Donaldson:
I refer to youir letter of August 8, 1988 accompanying the final
version of the completion report on the Seventh Highway Project partially
financed with Loan 1471-CO.
I would point out that comparison of the completion report with the
evaluation made by this Ministry in December 1986 shows a considerable
difference in the Final Internal Rate of Return, due unquestionably to the
fact that our evaluation was made without adaptation of the BDM Model (Version
III) to Colombian conditions. This adaptation is now under way.
Regarding the observations and recomendations made by the World
Bank concerning the reasons why the project objectives were not fully
achieved, I would like to inform you that since the completion of IBRD
Loan 1471-CO the Ministry, being aware of the administrative and budgetary
problems that arose, has been developing with Bank support a Program for the
Strengthening of Administrative Management which has produced very good
results to date, as is demonstrated by the progress in management of the
resources provided through Loan 2121-CO.
In conclusion, may I note that it is our intention to continue
creating mechanisms to improve management procedures and that the World Bank's
recomndations will contribute significantly toward enhancing exece ton and
furthering the accomplishment of our objectives.
Cordially yours,
/s/Luis Fernando Jaramillo Correa
Minister of Public Works and Transport
