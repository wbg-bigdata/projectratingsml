BRAZIL
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
CEEE POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
1. THE SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      The estimated total gross consumption of energy in Brazil in 1978
was 109,733 M.T.o.e. (0.93 T.o.e. per capita, compared to about 0.79 T.o.e.
per capita for Costa Rica and 1.6 T.o.e. for Mexico) 1/ and it is expected to
grow at about 6% per annum in the next 5 years, reaching about 1.11 T.o.e.
per capita in 1983. Oil products account for about 42% of the national energy
consumption, mineral coal, wood products and wastes 32% and hydroelectricity
26% (see Annex 1). In 1978, generation of electric energy from all primary
sources is estimated to have been 111 TWh; its annual rate of growth since
1973 has been 11% with per capita consumption in the same period going from
550 to 839 kWh.
1.02      Brazil's proven oil reserves are limited.  Present domestic produc-
tion of crude covers only 15% of the country's requirements and is concen-
trated in the Northeastern region. To increase domestic production Government
accelerated exploration in 1977 by granting risk type contracts to private
concerns, putting an end to government monopoly in this field.
1.03      Brazil has vast water resources with a potential for hydroelectric
development estimated at about 200,000 MW, of which only about 21,600 MW
have been utilized. An additional 35,000 MW are scheduled to be in operation
by 1990. Many of the more promising watersheds are relatively remote from the
demand centers and hence might not be the least cost solution to supplying
them for some time. Under pronounced differences in regional hydrological
regimes, electrical interconnections could economically substitute or diminish
use of thermal generation. This diversity exists between the Southern and
Southeastern regions and a high voltage interconnection is under construction
and being financed with Loan 1343-BR to Centrais Eletricas do Sul do Brazil
(ELETROSUL).
1.04      Coal is another source of energy the Government is counting on
to supply an increasing share of Brazil's energy requirements. Total
reserves are estimated at 15.8 billion tons, with about 10% of this already
proven, representing an important part of Brazil's domestic energy resources.
1/ Nearly all of the reserves identified to date are in the far south of
Brazil, primarily in the states of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina.
Coal presently accounts for only about 4.0% of Brazil's energy production.
The Government is also encouraging substitution of coal for other
1/   T.o.e.:  tons of oil equivalent, approximately 10  kcal; M.T.o.e. =
1,000 T.o.e. Data source: Ministry of Mines and Energy, Balanco
Energetico Nacional of 1978. Per capita incomes were as follows:
Brazil:  US$1570; Costa Rica:  US$1540; Mexico:  US$1290.

fuels in industrial boilers, especially in the cement industry. The Government
is also planning to reduce by 10% next year all deliveries of fuel oil to grain
dryers, and stop altogether deliveries of fuel oil to tobacco dryers. The
Government is now beginning to offer heavily-subsidized loans to finance these
conversions to coal-burning furnaces. The Government believes that these
incentives, coupled with sharply increased investments in coal mining, will
help to increase coal's share of the national energy supply to about 6% by 1987.
1.05      3,000 MW of nuclear generating capacity has been scheduled for 1985
operation in the Southeastern region, the largest demand center in the country.
The first unit of 600 MW, supplied by Westinghouse (USA), is expected to operate
in 1980.  The Brazil-West Germany agreement of June_27, 1975 provides for the
supply of an additional 2,400 MW in nuclear plants and a Brazilian option for
six additional 1,200 MW units. Because of substantial cost increases, the
Brazilian Government is, however, reviewing its commitment to developing future
nuclear generating plants.
1.06      Other energy sources such as firewood, charcoal and sugar-cane
bagasse are also used but not for electric public service. These fuels repre-
sent about a quarter of Brazil's energy utilization and would probably not
increase. Of lesser current significance in Brazil is natural gas, with
apparently small reserves in Northeastern fields for local supply. There are
few sites for tidal energy development, and geothermal fields have not yet been
discovered. Brazil has been active in exploring the use of alcohol as fuel in
internal combustion engines. In a first phase of the government's alcohol
program, started in 1974, gasoline is being blended with up to 20% alcohol in
many states. In a second phase, 100% alcohol-run cars are to be introduced
on a commercial scale beginning in 1980. Annual alcohol production is pro-
grammed to increase from around 3.3 billion liters in 1979 to about 11 billion
liters by 1985. In the power sector, tests are being conducted on wind-driven
generators.
Electric Energy Use in the Southeastern and Southern Regions
1.07      The Southeastern region, with 42% of Brazil's population accounted
for about 71% of the total electric energy utilized in the country in 1978.
The Southern region, with 18% of the population, utilized 12%. The two
regions, where most of the country's agricultural and industrial production
takes place, used in 1978 about 80% in all energy forms. In the last five
years, electricity generation in the Southeastern region-grew at 11% p.a. and
at 15% in the Southern region.
1.08      The Southern region, comprising the States of Parana, Santa Catarina
and Rio Grande do Sul has an area of 577,723 sq km, or 7% of the Brazilian
territory; Rio Grande do Sul has about 7% of Brazil's population and in
1978 accounted for about 5% of Brazil's electricity consumption.
Bank Participation in the Sector
1.09      Since 1949 the Bank has made 32 loans to the Brazilian power sector
amounting to about US$1.4 billion. Most have been for hydroelectric plants
and associated transmission facilities in the Southeastern and Southern



-3-
regions. Bank participation has contributed to sector organization and
planning and facilitated foreign commercial financing of the sector. The
Bank also assisted the Government in its effort to implement a tariff policy
which has enabled the sector to contribute a considerable proportion of the
funds required for sector investments. Project performance audit reports on
power-plant 1/ and distribution-system 2/ projects have been distributed to
the Executive Directors. These reports conclude that, despite construction
delays and cost overruns, the projects were substantially successful. The
latest report points to a growing inadequacy of tariffs in relation to the
economic cost of power supply (and to investment requirements) (also see paras
1.17 and 1.18).
1.10      The most recent loans have been for transmission and distribution
projects: Loan 1257-BR to COPEL for its 1976-1979 distribution expansion
program, May 1976; Loan 1300-BR to ELETROBRAS for the system expansion programs
of three Northeastern utilities, August 1976; Loan 1343-BR to ELETROSUL for
its high voltage transmission expansion program, February 1977; Loan 1538-BR
to ELETROBRAS for the system expansion programs of three state-owned utilities;
two in the Southeastern region and one in the South, May 1978, and Loan
1721-BR to COPEL for its 1980-1983 distribution expansion program, May 1979.
1.11      Preparation of the proposed loan, which would be for subtransmission
and distribution, was undertaken simultaneously with Loan 1721-BR but took
longer to complete because of CEEE's lack of experience in preparing a
project for Bank consideration. The proposed loan would be the second to
CEEE. The first loan (June 1952) was to help finance CEEE's 1952-1957 expansion
program. It was cancelled at the request of CEEE in 1957 for domestic political
reasons. Bank participation in this proposed project is principally oriented
towards providing financing for most economical procurement of project equipment
and materials, as well as helping CEEE to secure foreign commercial financing
through cofinancing arrangements. In addition, the agreements on the proposed
Bank loan would assist in providing electricity to urban low-income households
in the State of Rio Grande do Sul. The proposed Bank-financed project would
have important institution-building components both at the company (CEEE) level
as well as at the sector level.
Sector Organization
1.12      Though complex and one of the largest in the world, the electric
sector is well organized and the applicable policies have generally been well
formulated and applied. Decree 60,824 of June 7, 1967 established the current
sector organization under which the Departamento Nacional de Aguas e Energia
Eletrica (DNAEE) performs regulatory functions, grants licenses for generating
plants, assigns concessions, sets tariffs (after approval by the Ministry
1/   Loan 404-BR (Sec.M 77-532 of June 28, 1977); Loans 442-BR and 566-BR
(Sec.M 78-34 of January 13, 1978); and Loan 728-BR (Sec. M 79-757 of
October 23, 1979).

of Planning) and approves expansion plans and Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras
(ELETROBRAS), a utility holding company, administers public funds for use by
its subsidiaries and state-owned utilities, and coordinates external borrowings,
expansion plans for major generating and transmission facilities, and operation
of interconnected systems in the country's network.
1.13      The five geographical regions are served by ELETROBRAS' subsidiaries
(bulk suppliers), in conjunction with state-owned utilities (principally in
distribution) as follows: Centrais Eletricas do Norte do Brasil (ELETRONORTE)
for the North and part of the Central-West; Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao
Francisco (CHESF) for the Northeast; Furnas-Centrais Eletricas (FURNAS) in
the Southeast and part of the Central-West; and Centrais Eletricas do Sul
do Brasil (ELETROSUL) for the South. A joint Brazil-Paraguay authority
(Itaipu Binacional) has responsibility for the Itaipu hydroelectric project
(12,600 MW) under construction on the Parana River. In January 1979, the
Federal Government, through ELETROBRAS, acquired from Brascan Ltd. of Canada
about 83% ownership of LIGHT, the largest distribution utility in the country,
serving the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo.
1.14      Government guidelines contained in the 1967 decree (para. 1.12)
promote concentration of public electricity services in the individual states
into single state-owned utilities. The resulting action produced mergers and
acquisitions by the major state-owned companies of most municipal and privately
owned utilities. The main existing state-owned utilities, ranked by value of
assets, are: Companhia Energetica de Sao Paulo (CESP); Centrais Eletricas de
Minas Gerais (CEMIG); Companhia Paranaense de Energia (COPEL); Companhia
Estadual de Energia Eletrica (CEEE) - Rio Grande do Sul; Centrais Eletricas de
Santa Catarina (CELESC); Companhia Eletrica da Bahia (COELBA); Companhia
Eletrica de Pernambuco (CELPE); and Companhia Eletrica de Ceara (COELCE). All
these utilities have been borrowers or beneficiaries under past Bank loans.
Tariffs
1.15      Consumer bills contain the following charges:
A.   The tariff, which on a nationwide basis, provides about 78%
of revenues collected from consumers. According to the current
legislation, these charges should be set at levels to cover:
(a) operation, maintenance and administrative expenses;
(b) taxes other than for income (mainly property taxes);
(c) straight line depreciation of average gross revalued
fixed assets in operation;
(d)  reversion (federal tax of up to 5% of assets in operation
to fund loans to concessionaires for facility expansions,
compensation of private utilities for acquisition of their
assets, and the Global Guarantee Fund--a tariff equaliza-
tion facility, see para. 1.16); and



-5-
(e) a legal return (normally between 10 and 12%) on remunerable
investment (net average plant in service plus an allowance
for working capital).
Currently, assets are revalued monthly in accordance with changes in the
ORIN index (the monetary correction index applied to Government bonds).
Previously this index was computed on the basis of past
inflation, with certain adjustments, and while somewhat less than
actual inflation rates, movements in the ORTN index roughly corre-
sponded to general price movements (with the exception of 1979, when
ORTN adjustment lagged behind the inflation rate by about 30% percentage
points). In early 1980, the Government announced, as part of a strategy to
curtail the exceptionally high rate of inflation (which for 1979
reached 77%), that ORTN correction for 1980 would not exceed 45%,
irrespective of actual inflation. In the same spirit, the Government
announced that devaluation of the cruzeiro would not exceed 40% in
1980, likewise irrespective of the difference between domestic and
international inflation. These matters will be closely monitored
by the Bank as a part of the dialogue which the Bank is maintaining
on overall economic and sector policies.
B.   The sole tax on residential, commercial and small industrial 1/
consumer bills, which provides about 12% of power sector revenues.
Forty percent (40%) from this source goes to federal sector agencies,
fifty percent (50%) to state and federal district utilities,
and ten percent (10%) to municipal utilities; and
C.   The Compulsory Loan (10% of revenues), an obligatory investment
scheme under which industrial consumers of more than 2,000 kWh
per month acquire ELETROBRAS bonds (20-year maturity yielding
6% and revalued through monetary adjustments).
1.16      In 1973 DNAEE initiated application of a policy to reduce regional
tariff inequalities in order to promote a more balanced economic development.
By 1976, with minor exceptions, average tariff levels had been equalized.
The Global Guarantee Fund (GGF) is used in the tariff equalization process
to supplement earnings of eligible utilities, allowing them to obtain a return
on remunerable assets of up to 10%. The GGF is financed through a surcharge
of up to 2% (40% of reversion quota) on assets in operation of all the utili-
ties (para. 1.15(d)). DNAEE has used its control over the GGF to encourage
improved performance by participating utilities. To be eligible for transfers
from the Fund, the law requires inter alia that utilities have (i) a return on
remunerable assets of less than 10%; and (ii) a valid agreement with the state
government for the payment of all bills in arrears by state agencies. In the
case of utilities owned by federal, state, or municipal governmment legally
obligated to reinvest their dividends in the utility, the law also requires as
a condition of eligibility the actual reinvestment of such dividends.
1/   Industries utilizing less than 2,000 kWh per month.



-6-
1.17      During the last few years, the Government's desire to curb inflation
through limiting tariff increases has resulted in declining tariffs in real
terms. DNAEE has been concerned that serious financial constraints could
arise in the future if the power sector utilities are unable to obtain revenues
sufficient to contribute appropriately to their own expansion programs. With
Bank encouragement (through Loan 1300-BR) DNAEE carried out a review of sector
financial requirements, tariff levels, and rate structures (para. 1.22). The
main findings of this study are:
(a)  the power sector faces an extremely tight financial situation
over the next 2-3 years, after a period in which its finances
have been weakened as a result of the need to undertake a
very large i11vesL;:l 1t program and the failure to increase
tariffs in real terms in line with increasing costs;
(b)  to maintain its financial equilibrium, the sector will need
to introduce substantial tariff-increases in real terms; and
(c)  the extent of the tariff increases will depend on the decisions
on the medium-term investment program and financing plan, which
the government will direct the sector to undertake.
These problems will be discussed in detail during a power sector review
currently in progress.
1.18      The Bank and the Government have maintained an active dialogue on
tariff levels. After an insufficient increase in early 1979 (about 37%) the
GoverJT1est. -rtated a second increase (about 12%) in August and a third increase
(55%) in November. While these were positive steps (interim increases had not
been granted in the past several years), the resulting increase for 1979
(49%) was not eorough to cover the 78% inflation rate for 1979. Although final
results for 1979 are not yet available, DNAEE does not expect Bank power
borrowers to achieve the legal return on remunerable asst-.; if, 10%.  As the
tariff covenants of the various loan agreements with Brazilian power borrowers
rely upon existing power tariff legislation, the Government, at the Bank's
request, has provid¾el ;issurances that:
(a)  the power sector as a vwhole will be allowed to obtain a rate of
return on remunerable assets of no less than 10% in 1980 and
subsequent years. This may still imply that some of the Bank's
borrowers may not be able to re.,L't ,   ninimum 10% in 1980 since
other companies may be allowed to earn more than 10% rate of
return. This possibility arises due to some technical constraints
in the distribution of the funds of the GGF (para. 1.16);
(b)  to reach the goal set in (a) above, it intends to allow the power sector a
further tariff increase of 30% by mid-1980, so as to approximate for 1980
the 10% remuneration for the sector as a whole, envisaged in the Brazilian
tariff legislation (which is reflected in various previous loan agree-
ments with the World Bank). The Government has further indicated that it
does not intend to defer any part of the 10% remuneration authorized for
1980 to future years, but that if, due to unexpected circumstances (such
as an actual inflation rate higher than the 45% which is the Government's
target for 1980), any of the Bank's power sector borrowers did not reach
a 10% remuneration in 1980, the shortfall would be fully recovered in the
next three years. Similarly, the Government has indicated that it intends
to allow the Bank's power sector borrowers which experienced short-falls
in remuneration prior to 1980 to make up such shortfalls, on a revalued
basis, in 1981 through 1983.



-7-
1.19      Under previous loans, Brazilian power companies were required to
maintain their revenues (including transfers from the GGF) at levels consistent
with sound financial public utility practices and in accordance with existing
legislation. Also, they were required to maintain their eligibility under
norms prescribed by DNAEE in the event they needed transfers from the GGF
(para 1.15(d)). Under existing arrangements, the Government has confirmed, in
a supplemental letter, the Bank's understanding that the revenues of the
companies should cover the cost of electric service and that the return on
remunerable investment including transfers from the GGF, should be 10%. This
has not in practice meant a guaranteed minimum 10% rate of return because, over
the last several years, DNAEE has:
(a) rejected portions of some companies' remunerable investments;
(b) rejected portions of some companies' operating expenses; and
(c) made extensive use of a Compensation Account which provides
for recovery of shortfalls in remuneration over one or more
years in the future in lieu of a higher remuneration in the
current year.
In addition, DNAEE has decreased the utilities' earnings by redefining the
concept of remunerable investment, lowering the rate base (by netting certain
liabilities against applicable current assets and by adjusting remunerable
investment to reflect average annual assets instead of year-end assets).
1.20      The Brazilian Government has agreed to amplify the existing rate
covenants so as to:
(a) require DNAEE to allow the concessionaires a reasonable period
of time within which to reduce their operating costs whenever
DNAEE proposes not to recognize claimed operating costs in
connection with the setting of the level of tariffs and transfers
from the GGF;
(b) require DNAEE to exchange views with the Bank regarding (a)
above, and inform the Bank of any changes in the criteria being
applied by it in determining whether a concessionaire's claimed
service costs are to be recognized;
(c) require DNAEE to inform the Bank within 30 days of any decision
on the levels of electricity to be allowed to concessionaires; and
(d) ensure that beginning with 1981, CEEE's 10% remuneration will be
fully provided in each year, and no part thereof shall be post-
poned to future years.
1.21      Information obtained from DNAEE in connection with Loan 1721-BR
indicates the need for improved criteria for recognizing or rejecting operating
expenses of concessionaires. DNAEE has agreed to carry out with the assistance
of independent consultants, under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, a



- 8 -
study of sector efficiency to be completed by June 30, 1981, including recom-
mendations on the criteria to be used by DNAEE in assessing expenses. DNAEE
has also agreed to discuss its consultant's findings with the Bank (para.
1.20(b) and (c).
1.22      Through 1975, Brazilian power tariff legislation enabled most of
the Brazilian utilities to attain a reasonable return on investment and
allowed them to finance a considerable share of sector investments. Present
tariffs also contain generally appropriate features such as separate demand
and energy rates for industrial and commercial consumers, discounts to
encourage large industrial consumers to accept supply at higher voltages, and
life-line rates for rural and minimum residential consumption. However,the
tariffs do not provide for differentiation between peak and off-peak rates
or for seasonal variations in the cost of supply. The national equalization
features warrant reassessment. DNAEE, with the assistance of Eletricite de France,
undertook a study of bulk supply tariffs (13.8 kV and above) based on marginal
costs. DNAEE has presented the preliminary study to the Bank for comments as
agreed under Loan 1300-BR. The principal conclusions which can be drawn from
it, are:
(a) current tariffs are below marginal costs; hence, there are good
economic, as well as financial, reasons for raising the general
level of tariff;
(b) there are strong economic arguments for introducing both
seasonal and time-of-day components into the tariff
structure;
(c) the structure of tariffs needs revision, particularly with
respect to the balance between energy (kWh) and capacity (kW)
charges, which needs to be weighted more heavily towards
capacity; and
(d) more detailed studies should be carried out of the costs of
generation, transmission and primary distribution, customer load
curves, and the practical application of marginal-cost-based tariffs
in Brazil to bulk sales. DNAEE has agreed that the terms of
reference for studies covering the above three major recommendations
would be satisfactory to the Bank.
The currently ongoing power sector review will discuss progress on these
recommendations in detail. To ensure proper follow up on point (d) above,
DNAEE has agreed to present a schedule for carrying out those studies and to
present their results to the Bank for comment.
Existing Facilities
1.23      By the end of 1978 the power sector had about 25,200 MW of installed
generating capacity of which about 86% was in hydroelectric stations and the
remainder in thermal plants (one-third in oil-fired steam units, about 15% in
coal-fired units and the remainder in diesel cycle and gas turbine units).
The high voltage transmission system contains about 34,000 circuit-km at
voltages ranging from 230 to 500 kV.



-9-
Coordination of Operations
1.24      In order to achieve the most economic operation of interconnected
systems, the Government established regional coordinating groups (Grupos
Coordenadores para Operacao Interligada - GCOIs); in July 1973 for the South-
Southeastern regions and in March 1977 for the Northeast. Under ELETROBRAS
coordination, the regional operating utilities plan and carry out improved
allocation of loads to generating stations, compensate for diversity in
regional load peaks and hydrological regimes and control operating costs
through reductions in operation of thermal plants, by higher use of hydro
facilities. Coordination will be further improved by a national supervisory
and control center now being planned by ELETROBRAS and for which Bank parti-
cipation is being considered. The national supervision and control center
would enhance the coordination of the operations of the Brazilian power
utilities as described above and would, in addition, result in substantial
savings in investment as it would allow the interconnected system to operate
with lower total generation and transmission reserve margins.
Access to Service
1.25      About 80% of Brazil's urban population is receiving electricity
service.  However, the number of people receiving this service in the rural
areas (where about 40% of the population lives) is very low. Government is
promoting expansion of subtransmission and distribution facilities to provide
electricity service to a higher proportion of the population, particularly in
rural areas. In projects financed by recent Bank's loans (1257-BR, 1300-BR,
1538-BR, 1721-BR), attention has been given to connections for such groups.
The proposed loan would contribute towards increasing the proportion of
urban population served in the State of Rio Grande do Sul.
Rural Electrification
1.26      Rural electrification on a national level was started in 1970 when
the Instituto Nacional de Colonizacao e Reforma Agraria, a self-governing
agency attached to the Ministry of Agriculture, was made responsible for the
planning, promotion and control of rural electrification through consumer
cooperatives. Progress, however, was slow (4 to 5 thousand customers/year)
and in 1974, ELETROBRAS created a rural electrification department to comple-
ment the Ministry of Agriculture's activities. ELETROBRAS' approach to rural
electrification has been that of financing distribution networks in rural
areas close to existing lines. It does not finance household wiring or
connection fees. ELETROBRAS finances 50 to 80% of the cost of individual
rural electrification projects at an interest rate of 12% (principal not
subject to monetary correction) with 15 years maturity including a grace
period of 5 years. This results in a large subsidy given inflation rates
much in excess of the interest rate charged. The remaining cost is borne
by the utilities or by consumers. The Ministry of Agriculture's program
(which has been assisted by two Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
operations totalling US$84.4 million, including US$68.7 million of funds
provided on concessionary terms) grants similar terms to participating rural
electrification cooperatives.



- 10 -
1.27     About 43,000 rural customers (about 200,000 people) were connected in 1978
through ELETROBRAS-assisted programs at a total cost of about US$100 million. Of these
new customers, about 44% were located in the Southeastern region and 43% in the
South. Over the period 1979-1981 ELETROBRAS expects to participate in projects
estimated at about US$570 million, resulting in approximately 160,000 new
rural connections (45% in the Southeast, 32% in the South, 3% in the Central-
West, 19% in the Northeast and 1% in the North), thereby providing services to
about 800,000 people.
Sector Development
1.28      No constraints have been observed in sector organization that could
adversely affect continued sector development. The high level of investment
required in the sector (about 9% of the country's gross domestic capital
formation) and the Government's present policy of limiting public sector
investments as part of the program to control inflation may, on the other
hand, affect future sector investment programs. Serious constraints could
arise in the future if utilities are unable to obtain revenues sufficient to
contribute appropriately to their own expansion programs (para. 1.17). In
connection with Loan 1538-BR, ELETROBRAS agreed to complete in 1980 a master
plan for sector facility expansions to the year 2000. This plan should permit
assessment of various solutions for maintaining adequate service reliability
while adjusting long-range investment programs affected by Government actions
to curb inflation. However, ELETROBRAS has been delayed in preparation of
the master plan. It is now expected that new agreements regarding the scope
and timing of the work will be reached in connection with the proposed loans
to ELETROBRAS--for system control--and to ELETROSUL--for transmission expansion.

2. THE BORROWER
General
2.01      The borrower would be Companhia Estadual de Energia Eletrica - CEEE.
CEEE was created on February 1, 1943, by the State Decree-Law No. 328. State
*        Law No. 4136 of September 13, 1961, gave it its current legal status as an
autonomous agency. Like most of the State power utilities in Brazil, CEEE
grew through the acquisition of several small private and municipal power
companies. Consequently, there was a shift in management outlook from a very
narrow perspective to that of a state-wide utility-capable of achieving
economies of scale to a much larger degree.
2.02      The utility is managed by its six-member Administrative Council
elected by the shareholders for a two-year period. This Council appoints the
Directorate, composed of seven directors and one President, for a two-year
period. The President of the Administrative Council is also the President of
the Directorate and the Chief Executive Officer. CEEE's present organization
structure is shown in Fig. 2.1.
2.03      CEEE has about 11,000 employees and serves about 1.2 million customers
(about 112 customers per employee, which is low considering the characteristics
of its service area, and the amount of work done by contracts). CEEE's paid
in capital as of December 31, 1978, amounted to Cr$5.8 billion of which 84%
was owned by the State of Rio Grande do Sul, 13% by ELETROBRAS, 3% by Munici-
palities and a negligible proportion by private shareholders.
Organization and Management
2.04      There have been serious difficulties in the proper administration of
the company caused by inter alia: several basic deficiencies in CEEE's struc-
ture and traditional practices, a rapid growth, rapid turnover of some of its
key personnel, the difficulties in integrating staff from several predecessor
companies, and a relatively independent course from the mainstream of the
Brazilian power sector. The proposed project attempts to deal with some of
these issues (paras 2.07, 2.08, 2.10, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13). CEEE has agreed
to hire consultants to carry out organization/management operations improvement
programs under agreed draft terms of reference. Final terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank should have to be drawn prior to the proposed loan
becoming effective. The estimated foreign cost of these consultants would
be financed with the proceeds of the proposed loan.
2.05      CEEE is currently addressing some of the above-mentioned problems
by carrying out an administrative reform, which is now in its second and third
(out of five) stages. As a result, CEEE has been evolving toward more central-
ized coordination of the operating units accompanied by more delegation of
responsibility for operations than before the reform started. This has already
resulted in significant gains in performance (for example, the number of
consumers per employee has increased from 73.7 in 1970 to 112 in 1979).



- 12 -
Training and Staff Relations
2.06      CEEE maintains a training center (Centro Tecnico de Aperfeicoamento
e Formacao-CETAF) which conducts courses for integrating new staff to the
utility and courses for training, developing and keeping its technical and
administrative staff informed of developments. In addition, CEEE staff is
encouraged to participate in courses and seminars offered in Brazil as well as
abroad. Between 1973 and 1978, 4,600 employees underwent training at CETAF
and CEEE's staff received a total of 155,000 hours of training. In addition
to the legal contributions to the Brazilian social security system, CEEE
provides its employees with extensive benefits and is currently studying the
feasibility of creating a staff retirement fund. Staff relations are good.
Salaries are generally competitive at both the state and country levels.
Management Systems
2.07      CEEE has adequate financial systems for planning.  However, annual
budgets are prepared by the Financial Directorate on the basis of statistical
projection of historical figures at aggregate levels. Once approved, the
budgeted totals are allocated to the various organizational units. Under the
administrative reform now in progress this procedure would be improved:
expense budgets would be developed by organizational unit, each unit would
have a greater participation than heretofore, and effective budget controls
would be introduced. The reform also includes the introduction of a management
reporting system (para. 2.04).
Accounting and Audit
2.08      CEEE's accounting system is satisfactory for the utility's needs.
It is based on guidelines established by DNAEE. Internal control functions
are vested in the Internal Audit Department which reports to the President.
Internal Audit carries out an extremely weak program of financial and opera-
tional checks (para. 2.04).
2.09      CEEE employs as its external auditors the local firm Koliver and
Dias Ltd., which is acceptable to the Bank. However, because it has retained
the same auditors for about ten years, it has decided to hire a new auditing
firm in 1980. In addition, the Fiscal Council, appointed by the shareholders,
carries out external control duties.
Billings and Collections
2.10      CEEE's billing is carried out by its centralized data processing
system; collections by the commercial banking system.  In case of non-payment,
the service is suspended about fifteen days after due date and interest and a
reconnection fee of 10% are assessed. As of December 31, 1978 municipalities
(and some Government agencies) had a balance of about Cr$211 million, represent-
ing 280 days of 1978 total sales to those agencies. The utility has agreed
to take appropriate measures to reduce these overdue receivables (para. 2.04).



- 13 -
Existing Facilities
2.11      CEEE has 1,063 MW of installed capacity of which 80% is hydro (para.
3.07). It had, at the end of 1978, 6,800 km of 44 kV and higher voltage lines
and 43,000 km of distribution level voltages. Its generating facilities are,
for the most part, fairly new and in good operating conditions as are the major
transmission lines. The distribution system, however, is not standardized,
reflecting the different original ownerships (para. 2.01) and past investment
and maintenance have not been up to the standards applied to generation and
transmission. The proposed project would address these deficiencies by
emphasizing proper planning procedures (para. 2.12) and the installation
of voltage regulators, capacitors and other equipment (para. 2.04).
Planning
2.12      CEEE does not have a centralized planning department and lacks
proper coordination between the planning staff of the various departments.
The preparation of the proposed project had to be carried out by a specially
formed task force, which resulted in delays. A major portion of the distri-
bution system has traditionally been built without due regard to changing
technologies, procedures or relative costs of materials. CEEE has agreed
to (a) reinforce its existing planning advisory unit, and (b) seek ways to
ensure proper coordination and feedback with the operating department (para.
2.04).
Operations
2.13      DNAEE has maintained that CEEE is not as efficient as it should
be in operating its system, citing as supporting evidence higher unit costs
incurred by CEEE in various aspects of its operations (than those incurred by
other Brazilian utilities, para. 1.19). However, it is not clear that DNAEE
has taken adequate account of the dispersion of the system, the type and
condition of the existing equipment and other relevant factors in reaching
these conclusions. The assessment of the adequate level of operating and
maintenance costs for a utility the size of CEEE requires an intensive,
detailed study of its performance which has not yet been done. CEEE has
agreed to engage consultants under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank,
to conduct a general utility performance review and suggest methods to improve
efficiency where warranted (paras. 1.21, 2.04).
Risk Management
2.14      CEEE's assets have been insured against most common risks such as
fire, accident, and civil liability, in accordance with accepted public utility
practices. Insurance is well administered.

3. THE MARKET AND THE MEANS TO MEET IT
General
3.01      Rio Grande do 5ul is the southernmost state of Brazil.  It has an
area of about 280,000 km and population of about 8 million people. The
economy of Rio Grande do Sul is based on diversified agriculture (grains and
livestock) and expanding mining (coal) and industrial (mainly petrochemical)
operations. CEEE sells 44% of the public electric energy supply of the Southern
region  (para. 1.08) and has 52% of the consumers.
Historical Market
3.02      Public-service electricity in the state of Rio Grande do Sul grew
at an average annual rate of 12.5% during the period from 1974 to 1978. The
growth in the number of customers was 8.5% p.a., while average consumption per
customer grew at 3.7% p.a.
3.03      This rapid growth was linked to the state's industrialization.  In
consequence, as may be seen in Table 3.1, the pattern of supply to the various
consumer groups has changed considerably in the last 12 years. The share of
electric energy sold to industries grew steadily from 36% in 1967 to 45% in
1978. Residential supply decreased its percentage of the market from 31 to
24% in the same period.
The Forecast
3.04      The forecast of energy sales (Table 3.1) is based on a methodology
developed by DNAEE for the sector. It relies principally: (a) on past trends
and estimates of future population growth for the residential sales; (b) on
correlation with residential sales for the forecast of sales to the commer-
cial and government sectors; and (c) on a detailed analysis of expected trends
and policies of the economy and of specific industrial projects for the fore-
cast of sales to the industrial sector.
3.05      The overall growth rate forecast for the 1978-1984 period is 13.2%
p.a. which is reasonable, although somewhat higher than the actual growth in
the previous 4 years. The industrial sector is expected to increase slightly
its participation to about 52% by 1984. Sales to the rural sector are forecast
to have the highest growth rate (33%). On the basis of a possible program to
replace diesel pumps (para 4.11), sales to the rural sector would grow at
about 42% in this case, the overall growth rate would be about 14.2%.
3.06      Unlike other large Brazilian utilities, CEEE does not require
that large potential customers sign firm supply contracts and hence the degree
of certainty regarding the forecast sales to industrial users tends to be
lower than for utilities that customarily have this requirement. CEEE has
therefore had problems in scheduling and planning its distribution investments.
CEEE has agreed to require all customers, with an estimated demand of 10 MW
or more, to sign firm supply contracts.



- 16 -
The Energy and Capacity Balance
3.07      CEEE generates at the present time approximately 58% of its require-
ments in its own plants. The remainder is purchased primarily from ELETROSUL,
the regional bulk supplier. Annex 2 presents the corresponding details on
CEEE's generating capacity.
3.08      The requirements for electricity supply by CEEE and its energy
purchases, have been forecast under the assumption that CEEE would maintain
its system losses and unaccounted for uses of electricity at about its
present level of 10.6%.  Under average hydrological conditions, CEEE would
be capable of meeting its energy needs and power requirements from its own
plants and purchases from ELETROSUL. ELETROSUL is familiar with CEEE's
demand forecast and has current contractual arrangements to supply these
requirements. ELETROBRAS, ELETROSUL and CEEE review these requirements
about every six months and have been able, in the past, to adequately adjust
system operation schedules to maintain service reliability within acceptable
levels, even under unfavorable hydrological conditions. For example, in
1978, the southern region experienced extremely adverse rainfall conditions.
However, the utilities, through their review process, were able to mitigate
the effects of the drought and to hold curtailments of supply to a minimum.

4. PROGRAM AND PROJECT
Background and Objectives
4.01      CEEE is faced with a prospective rapid growth in the demand for
electricity in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Its transmission and distri-
bution construction program through 1984, of which the project is part,
proposes to provide the facilities required to serve the anticipated loads,
mostly related to industrial growth. As some of CEEE's existing facilities
are already loaded at or near their technical limit, failure to provide these
facilities would lead to excessively costly curtailments of supply. Part of
the program set forth below would also make public service electricity avail-
able to low income urban and rural customers.
Generation Expansion Program
4.02      ELETROBRAS, ELETROSUL and CEEE have already reached agreement on
part of CEEE's future expansion program for generation. CEEE is thus completing
construction of the 500 MW Itauba hydro station which went into service in
1978. Also under construction and expected to be in service in 1982, is the
320 MW coal-fired station Presidente Medici B.
4.03      CEEE's present plans also include a 960 MW coal-fired station
(Candiota III), the first two units of which would be in service in 1986 and
125 MW hydro station (Dona Francisca) to be in service by about 1988. The
investment between 1980 and 1984 in these plants would be about US$790 million
(mid-1979 prices). Although ELETROBRAS has already approved the Dona Francisca
plant, CEEE has not yet demonstrated that these stations would be the least
cost solution to the problem of adding capacity to the interconnected system,
at the proposed dates or different ones. Consequently, they have not been
included in CEEE's appraised program. However, if CEEE intends to proceed
with Candiota III and Dona Francisca, the Bank would have an opportunity to
review their justification under the limitation on major expansion projects
(para. 5.03).
Transmission
4.04      CEEE's proposed expansion plans for transmission lines and sub-
stations would allow it to transmit the energy to be generated by its existing
and future plants and the purchases from ELETROSUL to its high voltage
customers and to its distribution system. At the same time CEEE would improve
the quality of its services as the program would allow the relief of CEEE's
existing system, estimated to be presently overloaded at several critical
points by about 6-10% at peak time, due to insufficient investment in the past.
4.05      Between 1980 and 1984, CEEE is expected to increase the total length
of its transmission lines (69 to 230 kV) by about 2,600 circuit km (from 6,600
at the end of 1978) and its substation capacity by about 3,000 MVA (from 2,700 MVA
at the end of 1978).

Distribution
4.06      The distribution expansion program to be carried out by CEEE during
1980-1984 focuses on the following objectives:
(a) providing adequate capacity at appropriate points of the system
to meet the expected increases in load;
(b) maintaining or improving the reliability of service throughout
the system;
(c) expanding service to low-income urban and rural areas.
4.07      In order to meet these objectives, CEEE's program includes the
following items:
Quantity
-  13 and 23 kV feeders                    2,800 circuit-km
-  meters                                  915,000
-  MVA of distribution transformers        377
Rural Electrification and Low Income Connections
4.08      CEEE's program includes the connection of about 35,000 urban low
income consumers and 12,000 rural customers. To ensure that the potential
urban low-income consumers are in fact connected and receive service, CEEE
has agreed to offer them financing, free of interest and other changes, over
a period of at least 18 months, for the household wiring and other items
necessary for connection, as well as for connection fees. The monthly pay-
ments, which would include the cost of up to 30 kWh are not likely to exceed
US$5.00. This amount is not expected to exceed 5% of the estimated household
income of the lower 40% income group.
General Plant
4.09      The program also includes such necessary ancillary equipment as
tools, vehicles, laboratory and shop equipment.
Program Costs
4.10      The 1980-1984 investment plan has been designed to meet expected
increases in demand at acceptable reliability levels. The estimated invest-
ments of this expansion program appear in Table 4.1 and are summarized below
(in prices of mid-1979):

It is however possible that the General Secretariat of Planning may impose
limits on sectoral investments as part of its program to constrain inflation.
This could result in a reduction of CEEE's program. These costs (which do
not include price contingencies) were estimated by CEEE on the basis of
prices generally prevailing in 1978 and have been updated by indexes to reflect
mid-1979 price levels.
Other Possible Investments
4.11      In addition to the above program, CEEE has been requested by
Rio Grande do Sul authorities to extend and/or reinforce its system during
the same period to allow the substitution of electric motors for diesel
engines used for rice irrigation throughout the State. This program would
require a total of about US$340 million (mid-1979 prices) of CEEE investment
to complete over several as yet undetermined number of years, but has yet
to be economically justified and hence is not included in CEEE's program as
appraised. Draft terms of reference for studying this program will be sent
to the Bank for review by March 31, 1980.
The Project
4.12      The project would consist of a portion of CEEE's 1980-1984 trans-
mission and distribution expansion program as well as studies regarding
(i) the proposed conversion of irrigation pumps from direct diesel drive
to electric drive (para. 4.11); and (ii) CEEE improvement programs (para.
2.04). The transmission and distribution portion of the project would consist
of items which:
(a)  have been identified as of high priority in urban areas;
(b)  are scheduled to be started not earlier than October 31, 1980
and completed not later than March 31, 1984; and
(c)  have already been technically and economically justified.
4.13      The individual transmission and distribution project components are
indicated in detail in Table 4.2 and summarized below:

4.14      The estimated project cost is US$314 million, of which US$114 million
is the estimated foreign cost (36.3%). It is summarized below and the detailed
estimate is shown in Table 4.2.

The base costs were estimated by CEEE on the basis of generally prevailing
prices in 1978, updated'by indexation to reflect mid-1979 price levels, and
found reasonable by the Bank. The engineering and administration costs for the
project as well as applicable taxes and duties, are included in the base cost
estimates. The cost of consulting services to be required by CEEE has been
estimated on the basis of 300 man-months at a cost of about US$10,000 per
man-month, including subsistence and travel expenses. Physical contingencies
have been estimated between 7 and 20% of the base estimates of the individual
components of the program, depending on the status of the engineering; the
overall average is about 11%. The price contingencies have been calculated on
the basis of assumed annual rates of price escalation of 14% for 1978, 12% for
1979, 10.5% for 1980, 9% for 1981, 8% for 1982 and 7% thereafter for all costs
(in US dollar terms).
Execution of Works
4.15      CEEE's own staff will prepare specifications and bidding documents
and will carry out the necessary engineering and supervision of construction.



- 22 -
This is acceptable as CEEE has experience in similar works. CEEE's procure-
ment department is well organized and fully capable of carrying out all of the
necessary procurement activities; nevertheless, CEEE is considering using the
services of a consultant to assist it in connection with international bids
to benefit from the experience gained in this respect under other Brazilian
projects.  CEEE has already prepared most procurement specific,LLins and no
major delays are expected in the issuance.
4.16      Project subtransmission and distribution works will be spread
throughout the State of Rio Grande do Sul. Most of these works will be
executed concurrently. They are not suitable for effective and economical
handling by a single contractor.   CEEE, therefore,;expects that state-based
contractors (of which there are many qualified to perform the work) will
submit the winning bids for these works. Installation of major equipment
will be done in most instances by the suppliers, under CEEE staff supervision.
Construction of short line extensions and some equipment installation will be
performed by CEEE's own forces.
4.17      The project implementation schedule envisages completion by March 31,
1984, which is reasonable. The detailed schedule (Annex 3), would be used to
monitor progress during the project construction period.
Procurement
4.18      Procurement of equipment and materials to be financed by the Bank
will be through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with
the Bank's guidelines. Manufacturers of equipment whose bids contain compo-
nents manufactured in Brazil equal to at least 50% of the value of bid would
be given a margin of preference of 15% or the applicable import duties,
whichever is lower. Based on the outcome of ICB recently completed for
similar projects, it is expected that Brazilian suppliers will be awarded
about half of the value of the contracts placed through ICB. The detailed
schedule (Annex 4) would be used to monitor procurement activities.
4.19      Items not financed by the Bank loan include equipment and materials
which are unlikely to attract foreign bids under ICB. Bulky items, such as
wood or concrete poles, civil construction materials, as well as miscellaneous
hardware and connectors, are examples of the goods that CEEE would procure
according to its normal competitive bidding procedures, which are satisfactory.
Local prices for these types-of goods and equipment are about the same as in
other countries and total project cost is not expected to increase due to local
procurement.
Disbursement
4.20      Disbursements, which will be fully documented, would be made for
the following:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported equipment and
materials, including the foreign cost of installations.



- 23 -
(b) 100% of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment
and materials; and
(c) 50% of expenditures for consultants' services.
4.21      The estimated schedule of disbursements, shown in the table below,
is based on the procurement program and on the assumption that loan effec-
tiveness would be June 30, 1980.

June 30, 1984            10                   114
The closing date would be June 30, 1984, six months after project completion.
Environment
4.22      CEEE intends to route and build its lines and locate its
substations with due regard to environmental and aesthetic considerations.
Their visual impact will be minimized, natural drainage is not likely to
be affected and right-of-way clearing will be kept to a minimum.
Project Risks
4.23      The project faces no major risks other than those normally associated
with this type of project, i.e., delays due to lateness in the procurement and
engineering process. A reasonable allowance for these has been included in
the schedule and no major delays are expected. However, there is a regulatory
risk in that lack of adequate tariffs may lead to a deterioration of CEEE's
financial position or a substantial postponement of its investment program
(paras. 1.17 through 1.20, and 6.03).

5. FINANCES
Financial History and Present Position
5.01      Over the years 1976 through 1978 CEEE's rate of return on remuner-
able investment averaged a poor 5.7% because DNAEE disallowed a portion of
CEEE's operating expenses and remunerable investment (para. 1.19). DNAEE
considered these to be above sector norms (para. 2.13). CEEE and DNAEE
have solved their differences on remunerable assets and are negotiating an
interim plan to reduce personnel expenses. The sector efficiency measurement
study (para. 1.21) and the CEEE efficiency study (para. 2.13) should provide
a sound basis for DNAEE's regulation of CEEE in the future. DNAEE has agreed
that until these studies are completed and, if required, it will accept the
utility's expenses at a level not lower in real terms than those accepted for
1980 for the determination of the cost of service.
5.02      Despite its poor 1976-1978 earnings record, CEEE was able to finance
about 20% of its investment expenditures with its own resources (42% with
total consumer-based resources), which is acceptable, and cover its debt
service with its gross internal cash generation by a satisfactory margin.
This is explained because in the past CEEE invested less than the minimum
requirements for system expansion (para. 4.04), and the utility was favored by
its low level of debt service. CEEE's 1976-1978 average debt/equity ratio was
about 40/60. This ratio is reasonable when considering that the weighted
average repayment period for CEEE's outstanding debt of about 7-1/2 years
helped finance investment with an average life of more than 30 years. CEEE's
principal local creditors are ELETROBRAS and Brazilian development banks;
the main foreign creditors are Credit Comercial de France and Alsthom Atlantique.
CEEE financial experience over 1976-1978 and its estimated 1979 finances are
shown in Tables 5.1 through 5.5.

- 30 -
The investment plan has been designed to meet expected increases in demand
at acceptable reliability levels. However, it is possible that this plan
will be curtailed by the Federal Government in 1980 (para. 4.10). To ensure
that the Bank has an adequate opportunity to review new projects (paras. 4.03
and 4.11) and their impact on CEEE's finances prior to their being firmly
committed, CEEE has agreed that it will not undertake any major rojects until
the completion of the proposed distribution project, unless it has provided
evidence satisfactory to the Bank that the project is economically justified;
that CEEE has adequate financial resources to carry it out and that: (a) in
the case of generation and major transmission projects, it is in accordance
with plans for power generation and transmission approved by ELETROBRAS for
the South region of Brazil; and (b) in other cases,-that it has been approved
by DNAEE. A major expansion project would be defined as one costing more than
2% of CEEE's gross revalued fixed assets in operation plus works in progress
in the case of generation and transmission and 1% in the case of distribution.
5.04      CEEE has prepared its financial projections in constant June 1979
cruzeiros to ensure consistency with financial projections made by Brazilian
authorities for the electric power sector. They consider the 6% rate of
return on remunerable investment approved by DNAEE for 1979 and assume 10%
thereafter (para. 1.18). The financing plan shows that a 10% return on
remunerable investment is required to achieve an acceptable 28% contribution
to CEEE's investment from consumers (42% average for 1976-1978). If sector
tariffs are not raised sufficiently to provide this level of remuneration, CEEE
would not be able to make the investments needed to meet demand and maintain
adequate reliability, without excessive borrowing or heavy support from the
State budget. CEEE's financing plan is based on the assumption of full rein-
vestment of declared dividends from the State Government, the municipalities
and ELETROBRAS. The State of Rio Grande do Sul and its municipalities are
required, by law, to invest in the power sector 100% of the proceeds of the
sole tax accruing to them (para. 1.15). The State has agreed to reinvest in
CEEE all of the dividends declared by the utility on the State's equity in
CEEE and to invest in CEEE 100% of its share in the proceeds of the sole tax.
In addition, the State has confirmed its agreement to invest in CEEE's equity
no less than US$14 million per annum, in June 1979 constant dollars, which
CEEE needs to maintain an adequate capitalization.
5.05      CEEE financing arrangements during project construction are reason-
able. Total funds to be obtained from consumers would contribute 28% of the
financing requirements. Total borrowings would contribute some US$1 billion
equivalent or 68% of total requirements. These borrowings include the proposed
Bank loan of US$88 million (in prices of June 1979), which would provide 7% of
the requirements. The Bank loan has been assumed to carry an 8% interest rate
for a period of 15 years including 3 years of grace. Existing loans would
provide some US$192 million or 12% of requirements. The main undisbursed
foreign borrowings are two loans which aggregate US$170 million equivalent
and which are assisting CEEE to finance the Presidente Medici B plant (para.
4.02). These two loans carry each a 7.5% interest rate and their average



- 31 -
maturity is 11-1/2 years, including 4 years of grace. Loans currently under
consideration would provide US$120 million or 8% of requirements. CEEE
expects to obtain them mainly from ELETROBRAS and Brazilian development banks
under their normal conditions (see Annex 6) and some minor amourts from local
and foreign commercial banks.
5.06      The remaining debt financing of US$672 million or 41% of require-
ments would be provided by future loans for which sources have not yet been
identified. Future loans have been assumed to carry a 10% interest rate for
a period of 10 years including 5 years of grace. They include US$85 million
cofinancing, in prices of June 1979. CEEE has agreed to borrow in the foreign
capital markets, through one or more loans, the equivalent of about US$110
million (in current prices) prior to June 30, 1982, under the usual cofinancing
arrangements with the Bank. In spite of the relatively high percentage of
required financing for which sources have not yet been identified, CEEE is
not expected to have problems in finding adequate sources for this financing.
CEEE's construction program includes a large number of rather small projects
which would allow the utility to shift its construction schedule if financing
difficulties should temporarily occur. However, the Federal and State Govern-
ments have agreed to provide all funds necessary for completion of the proposed
Bank-assisted project should CEEE's financial resources be inadequate.
Financial Outlook
5.07      CEEE's unsatisfactory financial performance (para. 5.01) is expected
to continue in 1979, when the utility only expects its gross internal cash
generation to cover its debt service requirements 1.1 times and to finance
with funds from sector sources only 15% of its financing needs. However,
under the assumption that the utility will be allowed a 10% rate of return
on remunerable investment from 1980 onwards (para. 1.18), its performance
would slightly improve. Thus, over 1983-1985 CEEE would, in the average,
cover its debt service requirements 1.4 times with its gross internal cash
generation, and finance with funds from sector sources about 30% of its
financing needs. CEEE's debt/equity ratio appears very stable at a 55/45
level. CEEE has agreed to be bound by a debt limitation covenant which
provides that CEEE should obtain the Bank's agreement before incurring long-
term borrowing during project execution whenever its annual internal cash
generation is less than 1.5 times its maximum future debt service requirement.
CEEE's debt service coverage would also improve if its investment plan was
judiciously curtailed by the Federal Government (para. 5.03) so as to obtain a
positive differential between incremental revenues and debt service. To this
end the Federal and State Governments and CEEE have agreed to exchange views
with the Bank prior to any reduction of CEEE's expansion program exceeding 10%
of CEEE's investment expenditures. On the other hand, CEEE's debt service



- 32 -
coverage would tend to decrease if it did undertake those projects not yet
authorized by ELETROBRAS/DNAEE or not yet proven feasible (see footnote b/
para. 5.03) unless they were undertaken under favorable financing arrangements.
5.08      CEEE financial indicators (Table 5.5) show that a 10% rate of
return on remunerable investment is required so that the utility may achieve
a sound financial situation (see also para. 1.18). The Bank should continue
to monitor closely tariff developments over the next several years and maintain
the dialogue with the Federal Government on this matter.
5.09      Subsequent to the appraisal of the proposed project, in December
1979, the Government devalued the cruzeiro by 30%. DNAEE has ruled that the
consequent increase in the outstanding debt denominated in foreign currencies
will be capitalized in a special deferred assets account. This increase in
the debt will be considered as part of the remunerable investment for purposes
of future tariff setting; also, it will be amortized pari passu with the
repayment of the corresponding debt, and this amortization will be recognized
as an operating expense for purposes of tariff making. The financial projec-
tions on which the appraisal was performed did not reflect the devaluation of
the cruzeiro. However, rough computations indicate that CEEE's cash flow
during 1980-1984 would still be in balance (see also note a/ in Table 5.3).
Performance Indicators and Reporting
5.10      The targets indicated in Table 5.5 have been agreed upon with CEEE;
these targets should be considered as minimum as the sector efficiency measure-
ment study (para. 1.21) and CEEE's efficiency study (para. 2.13) should assist
it in improving its efficiency and its effects have not been taken into
account in setting these targets. These indicators will be used to monitor
the utility's performance toward meeting these objectives during the project
construction period. They will be revised, if necessary, after the efficiency
studies have been completed.
5.11      CEEE has agreed to:
(a)  provide unaudited results for each fiscal year and expected
results for the following year not later than two months after
the end of each fiscal year;
(b)  provide financial statements audited by independent accountants
acceptable to the Bank together with a report on the audit, not
later than four months after the end of each fiscal year; and
(c)  to prepare such other reports as the Bank may reasonably
request, including project completion reports.

6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least-Cost Solution
6.01      The expansion program of the subtransmission and dist, bution
facilities is commensurate with the expected growth rate of electric energy
consumption and peak demand projections in different parts of the system
and at different voltage levels. Table 6.1 indicates in detail the present
and expected future loading of transformers. This information provides an
idea as to the reasonableness of the proposed program.
6.02      The proposed project includes equipment, such as transformers
and meters, for which no reasonable alternative exists. Where alternatives
do exist, e.g. in routing, sizing, loading or voltage of transmission lines
and feeders and in substation capacity, CEEE has selected, in most cases,
the least-cost solution (using an 11% discount rate). In a few cases due
to demands for standardization, urban congestion or safety considerations
there have been departures from the least-cost solution. These cases have
been kept at a minimum and have been fully justified by CEEE.
Return on 1980-1984 Investment Program
6.03       The  return  on investment was estimated as the discount rate that
equates the present values of the benefits and costs associated with CEEE's
1980-1984 investment program. Benefits were measured by the forecast revenues
from the sales of electricity at the average retail level, using the tariff
in effect in June 30, 1979 plus the sole tax. The internal rate of return
using these benefits was about 3%. If benefits are measured on the basis of the
tariff in effect on December 31, 1979 and if CEEE's costs are assumed to
have increased according to the inflation rate between June and December 1979,
the internal rate of return would be about 7%. These rates of return are
lower than the opportunity cost of capital for Brazil, estimated to be 11%. These
results may provide evidence in support of the conclusions of the financial
analysis that tariff levels have been inadequate (paras. 1.15 through 1.22
and 5.01 through 5.09). They may also indicate that CEEE's efficiency is low
(paras. 2.13, 5.06). A rate of return of about 12% was obtained when the benefit
stream included sufficient transfers from the Global Guarantee Fund (para. 1.16)
to enable CEEE to earn 10% rate of return on its remunerable investment and
hence maintain its financial viability. Including these transfers, sensitivity
analyses indicate that the internal rate of return would be about 11% if program
costs increase by 15% and that if program costs do not increase but benefits
decrease instead by 10% or 20%, the return on investment would be about 10% and
8%, respectively. All results are based on economic efficiency prices for all
costs except labor. The use of efficiency prices for unskilled labor would
slightly increase the rate of return. The equalizing rates obtained understate
the real economic rate of return of the programs, because revenues from the sales
of electricity are likely not to fully reflect the consumer's willingness to
pay, some of the benefits to society, or the indirect benefits to industry
and commerce, whose production and employment depend on a reliable electricity
supply. Table 6.2 contains the cost and benefit streams used in the
calculations; the underlying assumptions appear as footnotes to the Table.

6.04      Sensitivity analyses were also carried out to determine the effect on the
rate of return of variations in the following parameters: (a) the cost of the
program; (b) operating costs; (c) time required to start obtaining the expected
benefits; (d) average price paid by consumers (tariffs); (e) the amount of
energy sold due to facilities built under the program--either because of
variations in the rate of growth of the market, the number of years in which
the new facilities reach their capacity or in the percentage of sales made
through these facilities or a combination of these variables; and (f) the rate
of exchange. Factors (a), (b) and (c) reflect risks which are, to some extent,
subject to control by CEEE while (d) depends on Government tariff regulation
and (e)--and to some extent (c)--is related to the accuracy of demand forecasts.
The results are shown in the graphs of Figure 6.1. The return is highly
sensitive to variations in total operating costs, particularly purchased energy.
Any increase in the cost of purchased energy would be analyzed by the Brazilian
authorities in the context of the applicable legislation and would be most
likely offset by corresponding increases in the level of retail rates. The
return on the Project is highly sensitive to future tariff levels, which will
require appropriate action by the Government (paras. 1.17 through 1.20, 4.23,
5.04). As noted in para. 2.05, CEEE is in the process of strengthening its
organization and engaging consultants to assist it in improving its efficiency
thus reducing the incidence of risk factors under its control. The other risks
are believed to be within acceptable limits.

b/  These costs have been estimated on the basis of the projected real increases in operation and maintenance
costs, allocated in proportion to the increase in sales assumed to be due to the 1980-1984 Investment Program.
c/  The unit cost of purchased energy reflects the energy and demand charges applicable for 1979.  This unit cost
may vary in the future due to variations in the load factor of the purchases and/or the difference between contractual demands and actual purchases.
d) See Chapter 3 for the forecast market through 1984; a 107. p.a. increase in total sales has been assumed after 1984.
e) It has been assumed that the existing system allows CEEE to generate, transmit, and distribute energy beyond its present level of sales and that
the new investments will reach their capacity in about 8 years after their completion.
f)  Assuming the followinghanefit per kWh sold (in Cr$): 1981, 1.690; 1982, 1.649; 1983, 1.686; 1984, 1.909; 1985 and thereafter, 1.817.  Benefit
per kWh has been estimated on the basis of   oune              1979 tariffs to the public, the sole tam, and the additional revenues  from the Global Guarantee Fund.

7. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The Bank has agreed with the Federal and State Governments, ELETROBRAS
and the Borrower, as applicable, on the following principal points:
(a)  CEEE will maintain its earnings at levels consistent with sound
financial and utility practices and in accordance with existing
legislation and will maintain its eligibility for transfers
from the Global Guarantee Fund; the Federal Government will
cause DNAEE to take timely action on the borrower's requests
for tariff adjustments and transfers and inform the Bank, and
DNAEE will exercise its statutory powers to allow the Bank
power sector borrowers a return on remunerable assets of at
least 10%; if Bank power sector borrower experienced a shortfall
in their remuneration in 1980, DNAEE will authorize their full
recovery in 1981; DNAEE will give Bank power sector borrowers a
reasonable time to reduce their operating expenses when warranted,
will exchange views with the Bank on the criteria used for
determing allowable operating expenses and will not use a
compensation account in lieu of adequate tariff increases;
DNAEE will allow Bank power sector borrowers to recover the
deficit in their remuneration, accumulated to December 1971 in
1981 through 1983; DNAEE will inform the Bank within 30 days on
tariff level changes; any change in legislation which would
materially and adversely affect the beneficiaries' financial
position would be an event of default (paras. 1.18 through 1.20).
(b)  DNAEE will carry out follow-up tariff studies (para. 1.22);
(c)  DNAEE will carry out a general sector efficiency measurement
study (para. 1.21);
(d)  CEEE will improve its budgeting (para. 2.07), its management
reporting (para. 2.07), its internal auditing (para. 2.08),
and its planning (para. 2.12);
(e)  CEEE will take appropriate measures to reduce its overdue
receivables (para. 2.10);
(f)  CEEE will conduct an efficiency study of its operation
(para. 2.13);
(g)  CEEE will require firm supply contracts from large potential
customers (para. 3.06);
(h)  CEEE will offer financing to low-income consumers who have
access to service but are not currently connected (para. 4.08);
(i)  CEEE will study the conversion from diesel to electric power
for rice irrigation pumping (para. 4.11);



- 44 -
(j) DNAEE will accept CEEE's expenses in real terms until the
efficiency study is completed at a level, no less than
that for 1980 (para. 5.01);
(k) CEEE will not undertake any major project, unless it provides
evidence satisfactory to the Bank that such construction is
justified technically and economically and that it has secured
the necessary financial resources (para. 5.03);
(1)  the state of Rio Grande do Sul will make equity contributions
to CEEE, will invest in CEEE 100% of the proceeds of the sole
tax and reinvest all of the dividends it may receive from CEEE
(para. 5.04);
(m)  the Federal Government and the government of the State of Rio
Grande do Sul will provide CEEE with such funds as may be
required to assure the timely completion of the project
(para. 5.06);
(n) the Federal and State Governments and CEEE will exchange views
with the Bank prior to any reduction of more than 10% in CEEE's
investment program (para. 5.07);
(o)  CEEE will not incur, during project execution, any long-term debt
without obtaining prior Bank agreement unless its gross internal
cash generation covers its maximum future debt service at least 1.5
times (para. 5.07); and
(p) CEEE will review and report regularly progress of the project
and CEEE's performance (paras. 5.10 and 5.11).
7.02      Presentation to the Bank of final terms of reference for CEEE's
organization/management/operations improvement program is a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed loan (para. 2.04).
7.03      With the above conditions and assurances, the project constitutes
a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$110 million equivalent. The loan
would be repaid over a period of 15 years including three years of grace.

a/ The balance shown for end-1978 includes the monetary correction for year 1978.
Beginning January 1978, Decree-Law 1598 (12/26/77) requires Brazilian utilities to keep two sets of books
for fixed assets - one based on cost plus monetary corrections and the other based on constant (ORT0)
currency units. The ORTN-based accounts are then converted to current cruzeiros at the end of each month
to reflect monthly price changes.   Consistently with the constant-price methodology for preparing
financial projections for Brazilian power sector projects, fixed assets have been kept at their June 1979
estimated level. The ORTN does not fully reflect price changes for power sector utilities; in this
regard see note b/ in Table 5.1.
b/ Assumed 25%.
c/ Computed at the rate of 10% on average construction in progress, according to Decree-Law 1506 (12/23/76).
d/ Assumed to grow at 4.5% p.a.
e/ Assumed to grow at 4% p.a. in real terms.
