LOAN 1824-BR
PREFACE
1.       This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the CEEE Power
Transmission Project, which the World Bank supported with loan 1824-BR
(1980; US$ 114.0 million). The borrower was Companhia Estadual de Energia
Eletrica (CEEE), the st.ate-owned power company serving Rio Grande do Sul.
2.       Fo: lack of adequate counterpart funding, CEEE completed fewer
works than expected at appraisal. Actual expenditures (US$ 148.6 million)
amounted to about 621 of the revised cost estimate (US$ 240.3 million).
The Bank cancelled the undisbursed balance of the loan (US$ 73.1 million)
in 1985 because of non-compliance with respect to important financial
covenants on the part of CEEE, the national Government, and the state
government.
3.      Approval and signing of the loan agreement occurred on,
respectively, March 27, 1980 and April 14, 1980. The loan agreement became
effective on July 15, 1980, as scheduled. The closing date was September
30, 1984, as scheduled.
4.       The Energy Division of the Latin America and Caribbean Regional
Office prepared this report based on information in Bank files and a final
project report prepared by CEEE. This report also reflects informatior
gathered as a result of discussions with Bank staff.
5.       In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) but the Project was not audited by 0D staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft re *   to the
Borrower for comments, however, none were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
CEEE POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
COMPANHIA ESTADUAL DE ENERGIA ELETRICA (CEEE)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       Because of a shortfall in counterpart funding, CEEE completed
fewer project-related works than expected at appraisal. The shortfall was
primarily due to the low level of transfer payments from the Global
Guarantee Fund (which transfers revenues between companies to equalize
their respective returns). Underlying the reduced level of transfer
payments was the deteriorated state of sector finances and the tariff
policy of the national Government. Inadequate equity contributions from
the state government also contributed to the shortfall. In circumstances
of severe financial restraint, the execution of the project lagged; and the
state government and the national Government failed to comply with their
respective covenants to supply sufficient resources to permit CEEE to
complete the project. Faced with such non-compliance and continuing
disagreement between CEEE, the state government, and the national
Government on a credible plan of financial rehabilitation, the Bank
suspended disbursements (1984) and later (1985) cancelled the undisbursed
balance of the loan.
2.   Between 1980 and 1984, the financial performance of the power sector
deteriorated, especially after 1981. The performance of CEEE was worse
than that of the sector. To reverse this deterioration, Brazilian power
authorities, after lengthy discussicns with the Bank, agreed (in 1981 and
1983) to increase tariffs according to formulas which superseded the
financial covenants of existing loan agreements. Notwithstanding the
efforts of the national Government to comply with these agreements, the
financial performance of the sector continued to fall short of expected
levels. To stimulate the introduction of appropriate tariff and financing
policies, the Bank conditioned effectiveness of loans 2564-BR and 2565-BR
(approved in June 1985) to Government presentation of a satisfactory
rehabilitation financial plan. In 1986, the Bank and Brazilian power
authorities agreed on a rehabilitation plan in connection with
Loan 2720-BR.
3.   By holding down tariffs, the Government undermined the financial
position of the sector which was also adversely affected by slackening of
economic activity and successive devaluation of recent years. Despite this
financial weakening, the Brazilian power sector continues to be well
managed with a better than average performance in satisfying an extremely
rapid growth and with good investment planning.



BRAZIL
COMPANHIA ESTADUAL DE ENERGIA ELETRICA (CEEE)
CEEE POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT (LOAN 1824-BR)
I. BACKGROUND
1.1 Bank Participation in CEEE and Sector Financing
1.1.1    The Bank has made two specific investment loans to Companhia
Estadual de Energia Eletrica, (CEEE), the state-owned power company serving
Rio Grande do Sul: (i) 1824-BR (US$114.0 million equivalent; April 14,
1980), which is the subject of this report; and (ii) 64-PR (US$25.0
million, June 27, 1952), which was cancelled at the request of CEEE in 1957
for domestic political reasons. Since 1949, the Bank has made 41 loans to
the power sector of Brazil, amounting to US$3.56 billion.1
1.1.2    There has been an evolution in the orientation of Bank power
lending in Brazil. Prior to 1976, most power borrowers were either the
increasingly efficient federal companies (operating subsidiaries of the
federal holding company, Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras, S.A. - EB) or the
better organized state and/or private power companies; and most Bank loans
helped to finance the construction of hydroelectric plants and associated
transmission facilities in the Southeastern and Southern regions.
1.1.3    Between 1976 and 1985, there was a re-orientation of Bank lending.
In most cases, the borrower was EB, but the beneficiaries included many of
the less organized state distribution companies; and the loans (with the
exception of a loan to finance system communication and control equipment)
helped to finance expansion of transmission and distribution systems
(including rural electrification systems) in all regions of Brazil. During
this period, the financial condition of the sector deteriorated, primarily
because the Government, in consideration of macroeconomic and political
factors, allowed the real level of electricity tariffs to decline (Chapter
5).
1.1.4    In 1986, there was a further re-orientation of Bank lending: the
use of the first sector adjustment loan to help in the effort to overcome
the financial difficulties experienced by virtually all power companies.
Planning for this loan began in 1984 when Bank staff and power sector
authorities began to collaborate in the preparation of a Power Sector
Rehabilitation Plan (PSRP), which has sector-wide technical and financial
objectives. Financial rehabilitation is expected to be achieved through
the increase of sector tariffs and internal cash generation and through
government equity contributions (including the conversion of existing debt
into equity). Loan 2720-BR was a quick-disbursing operation which
supported the PSRP by obligating the Government to implement tariff
increases and to provide equity contributions. The proceeds of loan
2720-BR loan benefitted four EB operating subsidiaries. The Bank and power
1/ US$3.40 billion, taking into account cancellations through December 31,
1986.

sector authorities are collaborating on the preparation of a second power
sector loan.
1.2 Sector Organization
1.2.1    As a result of progressive nationalization and growing
centralization over the forty years ending in 1974, the Brazilian power
sector evolved into a relatively compact structure of federal and state
utilities. Decree No. 68,024 of June 7, 1967 established the legal,
technica; and administrative structure of the power sector and defined the
structure as consisting of the National Department of Water and Electric
Energy (DNAEE), EB, and the various federal, state, municipal, and private
concessionaires, all under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Mines and
Energy (MME).
1.2.2    DNAEE has been performing regulatory functions, including the
granting of licenses for hydroelectric sites, assigning concession areas,
setting tariffs, and appr ving sector expansion plans. Since 1981, the
authority of DNAEE to set tariffs and to approve expansion plans has been
reduced by the effective transfer of final authority to the Secretariat of
Planning (SEPLAN/SEST), which has been reviewing plans for tariff increases
and investments within a broader policy context.
1.2.3    E3, a mixed economy corporation, whose principal shareholder is
the Goverrment, has been operating as an executing agency under the
jurisdiction of the WME and in coordination with DNAEE and SEPLAN/SEST. EB
has been performing the functions of: (a) utility holding company for those
power utilities where Government has acquired financial control; (b)
investment banker by administering public funds for use by its subsidiaries
and by state power companies; and (c) co-ordinator of the external
borrowing efforts of the individual power companies. EB has also been
carrying out a planning function by developing long-term, least-cost sector
investment programs and by analyzing generation and transmission projects
submitted by the individual companies; and an operational co-ordination
function through the Co-ordinating Groups for Interconrlected Operations
(GCOI's). Operating on a regional basis -- one for the South-Southeast and
one for the Northeast -- GCOI's are charged with the responsibility for
tiaximizing economic benefits through the most eff.cient operation of
interconnected generating plants and transmission systems.
1.2.4    At the operating level, the power sector consists of federal,
state, and municipal concessionaires. Since 1974, in accordance with
Government policy, construction and operation of major new power generating
facilities and related high voltage transmission systems are reserved
largely to four EB operating subsidiaries. EB also owns the power
distribution company for the state of Espirito Santo and the distribution
company serving the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro. EB has also been
investing in distribution companies; but the distribution function is
carried out at the state level mainly by utilities controlled by state
governments. EB also holds a 50% interest in Itaipu Binational, the
binational agency established (1973) by the Governments of Brazil and
Paraguay to build and to operate jointly the 12,000 MW Itaipu hydroelectric
facility on the Parana river.

1.3 The Borrower
1.3.1    CEEE is an autonomous agency of the state of Rio Grande do Sul.
The utility is managed by its six-member Administrative Council elected by
the shareholders for a two-year period. The Council appoints the
Directorate, composed of seven directors and a President for a 2-year
period.
1.3.2    In 1979, CEEE employed about 11,000 people, served 1.2 million
customers, and sol8. 5,228 GWh. The corresponding numbers for 1985 were:
9,900, 1.8 million customers, and 9,143.8 GWh. CEEE generates about half
of its electric4ty requirements.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.1 Origir. and Rationale for the Project
2.1.1    Bank staff first discussed the CEEE Power Distribution Project
with EB in June 1978. Given the postponement of an interregional
transmission project which the Bank had been expecting to appraise in
September 1978, EB suggested that the Bank consider financing the expansion
of the CEEE transmission and distribution systems; and committed itself to
help CEEE to deliver to the Bank a satisfactory feasibility study by
September 178. EB also suggested that the Bank consider financing a
distribution project proposed by Companhia Paranaense de Energia Eletrica
(COPEL) and a systems control center proposed by EB.
2.1.2    Ini;:ially, it was expected that there would be a single loan (to
EB) with multiple beneficiaries -- EB, CEEE, and COPEL; but it proved
impossible to process such a loan due to the different stages of project
preparation by the beneficiaries. Ultimately, the 'ank made separate loans
to all three companies.
2.1.3    An identification mission (September 1978) found that the proposed
project would consist of a portion of the CEEE transmission and
distribution expansion program for 1980-1983 (transmission lines at 230 kV
and 138 kV, distribution lines, substations, and related equipment); but
more detailed data was required to justify and tc define the investment
program, the project, their respective costs, and the size of the proposed
Bank loan. As CEEE staff did not understand the concepts of technical and
economic justification required by the Bank, the mission requested EB to
provide instruction in this area. CEEE indicated that adequate revised data
(technical, economic, and financial) would be available in November 1978.
2.1.4    The mission recommended that the project include a feasibility
study to determine the justification of proposed investments (estimated at
about US$100 million) in sub-transmission and distribution facilities to
permit the substitution of electric motors for diesel engines used for the
irrigation of rice fields. The mission also found that the operating
expenses of CEEE were above those allowed by DNAEE and that there was a
need to improve planning, distribution practices, and many finance- and
accounting-related functions. These findings would later lead to



-4-
recommendations for studies to improve the: (1) operations of CEEE as
regards planning, distribution practices, management reporting, budgeting,
and internal auditing; and (2) criteria by which DNAEE accepted or rejected
the expenses of operating companies.
2.1.5    According to the project brief (first version, dated October 27,
1978), Bank participation in the proposed project financing would support
the Government in attaining important sector goals by providing a portion
of sector financial requirements and by helping to mobilize long-term funds
from other external financing agencies, provided that the technical and
economic justifications for the project were forthcoming. One of these
goals was to extend electric power supply to under-served or unserved
areas. The other goals (maximizing the development of hydropower and the
economic benefits from the construction and operation of inter-regional
transmission lines) did not pertain directly to the proposed project. In
addition to financial help, the proposed loan would: (a) promote rational
tariff policies enabling sufficient self-financing for the sector;
(b) help to strengthen the management and planning of power companies,
particularly the small utilities; (c) reduce the operating expenses of CEEE
which exceeded the norms established by DNAEE; and (d) provide EB with an
opportunity to develop its project appraisal/supervision capabilities.
2.1.6    Preappraisal missions visited CEEE in December 1978, April 1979,
and June 1979. They continued to focus on the issues of: (i) definition,
Justification, costs, and sources of financing with respect to the
investment program and the project; (ii) the size of the proposed Bank
loan; (iii) sector finances; (iv) the finances and operating costs of CEEE;
and (v) DNAEE regulatory practices. Annex 2.1 sets forth details on the
findings of these missions.
2.1.7    The appraisal mission (Jxne 1979) estimated the costs of the
project and the program (covering the years 1979-1983) at, respectively,
US$280 million (with a foreign cost of US$100 million) and US$1,479
million. As compared with an earlier estimate (Annex 2.1, Attachment 1),
the new program cost estimate was lower due to exclusion of the costs of:
(a) a generating plaau. (US$173 million) not approved by DNAEE and
ELETROBRAS; and (b) transmission/distribution investment (US$100 million)
for a program of unproved feasibility (para. 2.1.4). The financing plan
for the program was: consumer-baaed contributions, US$260 million;
borrowing, US$1,152 million; and state contributions, US$64 million.
Project financing was expected to be as follows: proposed Bank loan, US$100
million; proposed loans from private banks, US$100 million; CEEE-EB, US$80
million.
2.1.8    As finally defined, the project would consist of: (1) studies
(institutional improvement; the feasibility of converting irrigation pumps
from diesel to e' tric power); and (2) a major portion of transmission-
distribution prog- a for 1980-1984: subst4tions at 230 kV and below; lines
at 138 kV and below; meters, communications and control equipment, and
connections for low-income urban consumers. This program would provide
facilities to serve anticipated load growth, mostly related to industrial
loads. The institutional-improvements study would help to strengthen the
operation of CEEE as regards planning, distribution practices, etc. (par&.
2.1.4). The feasibility study would determine the Justification for about
US$100 million of investment (para. 2.1.4). The mission recommended a loan



- 5 -
amounting to 'JS$100 million. The project was judged to be the least-cost
solution for meeting expected demand.
2.1.9    As  MAEE was disallowing operating expenses by applying indexes of
uncertain validity, the mission recommended that a sector efficiency study
include a study of the criteria for disallowing expenses (para. 2.1.4); and
identified the levels of power tariffs as a major sector issue. The
efficiency study would not be part of the proposed project.
2.1.10   The Bank accepted the mission recommendation for a loan of US$100
million, provided that the Bank loan were linked with a private bank
loan(s) of not less than US$100 million. Later, based on new estimates for
inflation, the Bank increased the size of its loan to US$114 million.
Reflecting revised inflation estimates, tize final forecasts on the cost of
the program for 1980-1984 and the project were, respectively, US$1,832
million and US$314 million. The financing plan for the program was:
consumer-based contributions, US$470 million; borrowings, US$1,280
million; and state contributions, US$82 million. The financing plan for
the project was: the proposed Bank loan, US$114 million, private bank
loans, US$100 million, and CEEE-EB, US$100 million.
2.1.11   The Bank informed CEEE thatt (i) agreement with DNAEE on asset
values and operating costs for 1980 would be a condition of negotiations;
(ii) receipt of one or more firm offers for co-financing would be a
condition for Board presentation; (iii) recovery in 1980 of the accumulated
rate-of-remuneration shortfall experienced by Bank power borrowers as of
the end of 1979, plus a Government guarantee of a rate of remuneration of
10% to all power companies in 1980 (and thereafter), would be conditions
for Board presentation; and (iv) signing of a private co-financing
agreement would be a condition for disbursement. The Bank also decided to
seek agreement for a study of the efficiency criteria used by DNAEE,
although such study would not be part of the project definition. Having
established its objectives and strategy, the Bank prepared to enter
negotiations.
2.2 Negotiations, Approval, Loan Signing, and Effectiveness
2.2.1    Annex 2.2 sets forth the major covenants of the loan, guarantee,
and project agreements.
2.2.2    Negotiations occurred during the last week of January 1980 and the
first week of February 1980. The state of Rio Grande do Sul covenanted to
provide CEEE with an annual equity contribution of US$14.0 million
(para. 2.1.10) for the years 1980-1984. At conclusion of negotiations, as
cofinancing and the level of tariffs had become issues, the representative
of the national Government felt he could not endorse in writing the agreed
minutes. It was another six weeks before an agreement was reached.
2.2.3    The Government objected to the conditionality on co-financing on
the grounds that it: (i) was not immediately necessary in the light of
investment and borrowing ceilings established for the sector in 1980 by the
Government; (ii) did not lead to better terms for Brazil; and (iii) imposed
needless delays in negotiations with private banks.
2.2.4    After discussion between the highest level of the Bank and the



-6-
Government, the Bank, in March 1980, agreed not to condition Board
presentation and disbursement to the receipt and signing of offers for co-
financing (para. 2.1.11); however, the Bank did insist that failure to
obtain co-financing by June 30, 1982 would be a condition of default. The
agreed minutes of negotiations noted that the amount and timing of co-
financing would be reviewed in the light of actual needs in 1981 and 1982.
2.2.5    The Government refused to commIt itself to recover the accumulated
rate-of-remuneration shortfall in 1980. The Government proposed that the
accumulated shortfall (and any shortfall in 1980) be recovered over a four-
year period beginning in 1981. The Government also refused to guarantee a
10 rate of remuneration if tariff increases proved inadequate. Again after
discussion at the highest levels of the Government and the Bank, the Bank
accepted the Gover.ment proposal, with the exception that the recovery
period would be three years.
2.2.6    Following agreement on these issues, on March 27, 1980, the Board
of Executive Directors approved a loan of US$114 million to CEEE in support
of the Power Distribution Project. The term of the loan was fifteen years,
including three years grace. The interest rate was 8.25X; the commitment
fee, 0.75%. Signing of the loan agreement occurred on April 14, 1980. The
Loan Agreement became effective on July 15, 1980, as scheduled.
III. PROJECT COST AND IMPLEMENTATION
3.1 Actual and Forecast Data on Proiect Cost and Execution
3.3.1    Annexes 3.1-3.3  compare actual and forecast project data with
respect to: (i) finished works, completion dates, and unit costs (depending
on availability of data); (ii) costs; and (iii) sources of financing.
Annex 3.2 also shows a revised cost forecast prepared by CEEE to reflect
experience gained during project execution. Annexes 3.4 and 3.5, compare,
respectively, actual and forecast allocations of loan proceeds and actual
and forecast timing of disbursements. Annex 3.6 sets forth the deflators
used to convert costs stated in current prices into costs reflecting prices
as of 1979. Annex 3.7 reviews the frequency and findings of supervision
missions. The following paragraphs discuss the information set forth in
these annexes.
3.2 Termination. Cancellation, and Closing
3.2.1    The CEEE decision to terminate the project coincided with Bank
cancellation of the loan (June 19, 1985). Only US$40.9 million of the loan
was disbursed. Informal and formal suspensions of disbursements had been
in effect since, respectively, April 30, 1984 and August 15, 1984. As
indicated in the loan agreement, the closing date of the loan was September
30, 1984. The Bank took these steps because of thes (i) default of CEEE,
its shareholder (the government of Rio Grande do Sul), and the national
Government with respect to important financial covenants (Annex 2.2 paras.
4, 8, 11 ); and (ii) inability of these three to agree on a financial
rehabilitation plan, especially equity contributions.   Fundamental to the
financing difficulties of the project and the program was the shortfall of



- 7 -
transfers from the Global Guarantee Fund to CEEE; and this shortfall
reflected the larger problem of sector tariffs and revenues. The elements
of this disagreement are discussed in Annex 3.7 and in Chapter 5.
3.3 Completed Works, Cost, and Timetable
3.3.1    When CEEE  terminated work in June 1985, it had completed fewer
works than expected at appraisal. For example, CEEE completed or
installed: (i) 371 km. of 69 kV transmission line as compared with forecast
levels of 550 km at 69 kV and 90 km at 138 kV; (ii) 267 MVA of substation
transformation capacity as compared with the forecast level of 1138 MVA;
(iii) 3,407 km of low-tension distribution lines as compared with the
forecast level of 6,000 km; and (iv) 23,843 low-income connections as
compared with the forecast level of 35,000. Purchases (as stated in US
dollars) for measuring, telecommunications, and miscellaneous equipment
(including inventories) were far below forecast levels. Closer to forecast
levels were completions with respect to kilometers of distribution lines,
MVA of transformer capacity, and consulting services (Annex 3.1).
3.3.2    The cost of the completed works amounted to US$148.6 million in
current prices (or about 622 of the revised cost estimate of US$240.3
million). Given the numerous elements of the project which were never
completed (para. 3.3.1), this figure cannot be meaningfully compared with
the forecast cost of US$314.3 million or the revised cost of US$240.3
million (Annex 3.2).   According to CEEE, the revised cost reflected actual
experience gained during project implementation which contradicted numerous
assumptions made at appraisal.   When CEEE revised its cost estimate, it
introduced small changes in quantities of material, which the Bank
accepted. Annex 3.3 compares actual and forecast sources of financing for
the project.
3.3.3   In most cases, actual unit costs were close to or less than
corresponding forecast data (Annex 3.1). The following compares key unit
costs:
Category                Unit            Actual         Forecast
(stated in thousands of USS, in current prices)
Transmission lines      km.             64.4            43.7
Substation              MVA             51.1            47.9
Distribution lines      km.             10.5            11.6
Low-tension lines       km.              5.9            14.1
Transformers            MVA             49.3           60.5
In constant 1979 prices, actual and forecast per-kilometer costs of the
transmission lines amounted to US$60,479 and US$37,770, respectively.   The
actual foreign unit cost was US$15,119 as compared with the forecast value
of US$9,731; the actual local unit cost was US$45,360 as compared with the
forecast value of US$28,039.   CEEE provided no explanation for the
differences in actual and forecast transmission line unit costs; but it
appears that high levels of domestic and international inflation (Annex
3.6) plus even higher rates of devaluation (Basic Data Sheet) experienced
after the delayed start of construction were major factors causing the rise
of unit costs in real terms.



3.3.4    It is not meaningful to compare the termination date of June 1985
with that expected at appraisal, March 1985. Those components which were
completed suffered delays on the order of 18 to 24 months. Initially, slow
market growth and unfamiliarity with Bank procurement procedures delayed
the project; but later the major source of delay was lack of counterpart
funding due to low tariff levels and inadequate levels of Government
contributions. Another factor contributing to delay was slow action on the
part of the Government in granting import licenses. On numerous occasions
CEEE requested that the Bark use its influence with the Government to
expedite the granting of import licenses.
3.3.5    Annexes 3.4 and 3.5 reflect the effect of project changes and
execution on the allocation and timing of disbursements. Annex 3.7 sets
forth details on the causes of project delay by reviewing the findings of
the nine supervision missions of the Bank.
3.4 Studies
3.4.1    The Guarantee Agreement provided for a study of the criteria by
which DNAEE accepted or rejected the expenses of operating companies from
the cost of service (para. 2.2.4). This study, to be completed by DNAEE
together with a companion study of the structure of tariffs based on the
marginal cost of supply, was supposed to equip DNAEE with the information
and standards for carrying out its regulatory function. The efficiency
study was not part of the project.
3.4.2    A supervision mission (November 1982) reported that the first part
of the study (i.e., relations between operating costs and utility
characteristics) had been carried out satisfactorily. Statistical analysis
showed that the number of customers served by a utility was the most
significant explanatory variable with respect to expenses for personnel,
materials, services, and miscellaneous (PMS). Other factors such as sales
were much less significant. DNAEE anticipated further research into the
productivity of various factor inputs (phase 2), followed by the formation
of audit teams (phase 3).
3.4.3    A later supervision mission (May 1983) noted very little progress
with respect to phase 2, wkiich analyzed global productivity of factors
(GPF) using a time-series analysis. The mission felt that DNAEE was not
very interested in the formation of audit teams, as this might generate
adverse reactions on the part of the operating companies. Bank files
contain no further information on the results of the efficiency study.
3.4.4    CEEE carried out the feasibility study for conversion of
irrigation pumps from diesel motors to electric engines (para. 2.2.4). Bank
staff reviewed this study in April 1982. It does not appear that a project
resulted from this study.
3.4.5    With Bank agreement, CEEE engaged two consultants for the
institutional improvement effort (para. 2.1.4): one to review internal
auditing procedures; and one to examine alministrative structures and
procedures. The Bank was satisfied that the consultants completed thorough
diagnoses.   Due to scheduling conflicts, consultant personnel were not
present to implement improved administrative structures and practices,
according to CEEE. There is no further comment on the results of the



institutional improvement effort in the supervision reports after 1982.
The project progress reports indicated that a redesign of some
administrative structures and organizations was carried out. In the final
project report, CEEE stated: "It should be emphasized that CEEE is not in
the habit of resorting to administrative consultants; and when there is
such resort, it is not on its own initiative, but to comply with
contractual obligations."
3.5 CEEE Management Performance
3.5.1    The report of the first supervision mission (August 1980) was
generally hopeful about management, as the mission approved of the
scheduling changes proposed by CEEE (Annex 3.7). Thereafter, Bank staff
found that in such routine exercises as the preparation of financial
projections, there were important mechanical errors or the introduction of
data (such as proposed levels of investment) which did not appear to be
fully justified. Bank staff also discovered the existence of: (i) hiring
(and above-normal turnover) of staff not fully qualified for management
positions; and (ii) parochial attitudes which contributed uiinecessarily to
friction with EB, DNAEE, and SEPLAN/SEST. Bank staff were concerned by
these findings. Annex 3.7 summarizes the findings of Bank supervision
missions.
3.6 Procurement, Performance of Contractors and Consultants,
and Cofinancing
3.6.1    Due to confusion over Bank instructions regarding the exchange
rate to be used to evaluate bids, there was delay during the spring of 1981
in issuing bid invitations with a negative impact on the timetable of
project execution. However, CEEE and the Bank supervision mission (October
1981) believed it was technically possible to complete the project by March
31, 1984, the closing date expected at appraisal. There were no major
disputes over contract awards.
3.6.2    The supervision reports recorded no dissatisfaction on the part of
CEEE or the Bank with the performance of contractors or suppliers. The
supervision mission of September 1982 expressed satisfaction with the
diagnostic work carried out in connection with the two parts of the
institutional improvement study (para. 3.4.3). Bank staff expressed no
comment on the feasibility study (para. 3.4.2).
3.6.3    CEEE obtained co-financing (US$65.0 million) to help finance the
project in 1982 (para. 2.1.10). The Bank suggested wording for the default
clause in the loan contract.
IV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
4.1 Actual and Forecast Data on Justification of the Project
4.1.1    Annex 4.1 sets forth actual and forecast data on sales by customer
category for the period 1980-1984. Annex 4.2 sets forth the return on the
investment program based on actual costs and expected benefits. The
following paragraphs discuss the information contained in these annexes.



- 10 -
4.2 Economic Justification of the Program
4.2.1    The staff appraisal report characterized the expansion plan for
subtransmission and distribution facilities as commensurate with the
expected growth rate of electric energy consumption and peak demand
projections in different parts of the system and at different voltage
levels. The report also stated that the project included equipment, such as
transformers and meters, for which there was no reasonable alternative; and
where alternatives did exist, e.g., routing, sizing, loading or voltage of
transmission lines, feeders, and substation capacity, CEEE had selected, in
most cases, the least-cost solution. In a few cases, according to the
report, CEEE had departed from the least-cost solution for justifiable
reasons (considerations of safety, urban congestion, and standardization).
While actual sales for 1980-1984 were about ten percent less than expected
due to lower demand on the part of industrial customers (Annex 4.1), there
seems tc be no reason to modify the positive assessment of the economic
justification of the project.
4.2.2    At appraisal, the rate of return return on the investment program
for 1980-1984 was estimated at 12X. Based on actual investment costs and
actual and expected operating costs and benefits, the return on investment
was estimated at 7.52.  This reduction reflects the low level of actual
tariffs in 1985 as compared with the appraisal forecast. This return does
not reflect increased tariffs consequent to implementation of the Power
Sector Rehabilitation Plan (para. 1.1.4). Implementation would increase the
return to 13.2%.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.1 Actual and Forecast financial Data. 1980-1984
5.1.1    Annexes 5.1-5.3 compare actual and forecast income statements,
sources and applications of funds, and balance sheets for the years 1980 to
1984. This period of time corresponds to that of project implementation.
Annex 5.4 compares actual and forecast key indicators of financial
performance. It also sets forth corresponding ratios for the sector. In
addition to slowing sales growth, the declining financial performances of
CEEE and the sector were primarily due to the reduction in the real level
of tariffs which reflected what the Government considered to be a
politically acceptable tariff policy in the face of inflation. The
paragraphs below discuss the information shown in the annexes together with
Government policies for the power sector.
5.2 Government Tariff and Financina Policies for the Sector,
1964- 1984: Revenue Covenants: Revenue Agreements of the
Early 1980's; and the Power Sector Rehabilitation Plan
5.2.1    Under the present sector organization (paras. 1.2.1 to 1.2.4), the
Government takes decisions on tariff levels with little participation by
the state governments or the utilities. Given this sector organization, a
brief review of Government policy since the early 1960's with respect to
sector tariffs and financing is fundamental to an understanding of the
financial performance of the sector, the financial performance of the
individual power utility, and the various revenue agreements of the early



- 11 -
1980'. which superseded the revenue covenants originally negotiated by the
Bank and Brazilian power authorities.
5.2.2    In the early 1960's, by establishing EB, and later in the early
1970's, by delineating the responsibilities of the federal and state
operating companies, the Government created a new sector organization
structure to make the sector an important contributing factor to the
economic development of Brazil. To provide adequate levels of funding for
the investment program, the Government contributed high levels of equity
funding ane set tariffs at levels sufficient to earn the legal rate of
remuneration (10-12%) on annually revalued remunerable assets. Revenue
covenants of Bank loan agreements conformed to and relied upon the national
power tariff legislation (para. 2.2.8).2
5.2.3    As a result of these tariff policies, the contribution of
consumer-based funding to the growing investment program irncreased steadily
throughout the mid 1970's, at which time the sector reached a peak of
financial soundness. In 1973, net (after debt service) consumer-based
financial resources amounted to 56Z of the sector funding mix whereas
borrowing had a share of only 302. Equity contributions constituted 14% of
the funding mix.
5.2.4    The oil crisis of the mid 1970's created a new set of financial
circumstances  for the sector: (1) inflation substantially increased the
unit costs of the investment program; and (2) real tariff levels
deteriorated as a consequence of Government policies, and the consumer-
based contribution to the investment program declined. Under these
conditions, Bank power borrowers were unable to comply with their revenue
covenants. The sector became increasingly dependent on borrowings,
resulting in heavy debt service burden in the late 1970's. Given these
circumstances, Bank staff identified the level of power tariffs and the
finances of the sector and CEEE as major issues (paras. 2.2.6). At
negotiations, the Government agreed that it would increase tariff levels to
achieve a rate of remuneration of 10% in 1980 and future years, plus the
recovery of revenue shortfalls of prior years over a three-year period
beginning in 1981.
5.2.5    In 1981, sales growth declined as compared with prior years
because of macroeconomic conditions. Together with political factors,
consideration of these macroeconomic conditions contributed to the
Government decision to delay raising power tariffs sufficiently to earn a
return of 10%. By the third calendar quarter of 1981, most power borrowers
were in non-compliance with the financial covenants established under
corresponding loan agreements. Given this state of non-compliance, the Bank
informally suspended disbursements on Loan 1538-BR and threatened to
suspend disbursements on all power loans if a satisfactory agreement was
not reached. The Government responded with a substantial tariff increase
in September 1981 and sought discussions on the formulation of a new
revenue agreement.
5.2.6    In October 1981, the Bank and the Government agreed that the
latter would implement quarterly tariff increases which would raise tariff
2/ Annex 2.1 sets forth the major differences between revenue covenants
for Brazilian and non-Brazilian power borrowers.



- 12 -
levels by 3% in real terms in 1982 and 5% annually thereafter, until the
sector achieved a 10% rate of return and past shortfalls were recovered.
This agreement constituted the first plan for the financial rehabilitation
of the sector. The Bank proceeded to approve a loan (2138-BR) in support
of the ELETROBRAS I Power Distribution Project. The table below shows a
substantial improvement in the rate of remuneration in 1981, as compared
with the previous year, although short of the agreed and appraisal levels
of 10% for CEEE and the sector:

5.2.7    The results of the plan did not meet expectations: sector tariffs
were lower in 1982 than in 1981.  This situation was due to: (i) delays in
the implementation of quarterly tariff adjustments; (ii) insufficient
corrective actions to compensate for foregone revenues caused by the
delays; (iii) a rate of inflation increasing faster than expected; and
(iv) the use of subsidized tariffs to promote exports and the substitution
of electricity for oil derivatives. As the implementation of the tariff
agreements never succeeded in recovering foregone revenues (in real terms),
real tariffs decreased by about 4% in 1982 and 17% in 1983. Foregone
revenues amounted to about US$0.3 billion in 1982 and US$1.3 billion in
1983.
5.2.8    As a result of the  poor financial performance of the sector in
1982 and most of 1983, the Government and the Bank agreed to amend
(November 1983) the earlier tariff agreement during the course of
negotiations for loans 2364-BR and 2365-BR. The amended tariff agreement
stipulated that the Government would raise tariffs sufficiently for the
sector to increase its rate of return by one percentage point annually
until 1989, when the sector was expected to earn a return on remunerable
assets of 10%. The 1981 agreement and its amendment in 1983 did not lead to
an amendment of the revenue covenants set forth in the loan documents for
the CEEE Power Transmission Project.3 Rather, the Bank com-itted itself not
3| In connection with the project, CEEE agreed to take all action
necessary for tariffs to be set at levels to produce revenues as
provided by Brazilian law (Section 5.06, Loan Agreement) -- that is, to
earn a return of 10% on remunerable assets (Annex 2.1). The Government
agreed to take all reasonable action necessary to enable CEEE to comply
with obligations contained in the Loan Agreement (Section 3.02,
Guarantee Agreement). The state of Rio Grande do Sul agreed to provide
enough funds to complete the project, if there were reasonable cause to
believe that CEEE would be unable to provide such funds (Section 2.02,
Project Agreement). The Government made a correspondins commitment
(Section 2.02, Guarantee Agreement).

to seek enforcement of these covenants as long as tariff levels were
increased as agreed. The agreements of 1981 and 1983 failed to produce the
financial rehabilitation of the sector.
5.2.9    The following paragraphs discuss the financial performance of CEEE
during the period covered by the financial forecasts, 1980-1984.
5.3 Sales, Tariff Levels, and Finances, 1980-1984
5.3.1    Table 5.1 below summarizes on an aggregate basis the operating
performance of CEEE during the years 1980-1984. Table 5.2 summarizes on an
aggregate basis sources and uses of funds of CEEE for the years 1980-1984.
5.3.2    Table 5.1 shows that actual sales (34,849 GWh) were about 102 less
than the forecast level (38,648.0 GWh). This shortfall reflected
macroeconomic difficulties. However, actual and forecast total operating
revenues were close (about Cr$39 billions, stated in 1979 prices) due to
higher than expected levels of averege revenue per kWh sold. Actual
operating expenses (about Cr$ 29.1 billions) were 22% less than forecast,
mainly due to lower-than-expected sales and unit costs. Actual net
operating income (about Cr$ 9.9 billions) was 410% larger than the forecast
level; but due to net reversion payments (Cr$4.1 billion) and reduced
transfers from the Global Guarantee Fund (about Cr$ 0.9 billion), net
income before interest (about Cr$6.7 billion) was 63% below the forecast
level. Reflecting the financial difficulties of the sector (para. 5.2.5-8),
the shortfall in transfers from the Global Guarantee Fund was large
(CrG$23.3 billion) and directly and negatively affected the level of
financial resources available for the investment program and the project.
5.3.3    The actual level of applications (Cr$20.9 billion) was
substantially less (46%) than that which was expected at appraisal. This
lower level of expenditures reflected the financial constraints affecting
the sector. Total consumer-based funding was negative (-Cr$7.6 billion)
and well below (- 171%) the level expected at appraisal (Cr$10.7 billion).
Actual borrowing (Cr$28.1 billion) was slightly larger than the forecast
level (Cr$26.8 billion). CEEE appears to have had no difficulty fulfilling
its obligation to obtain funding from private banks in support of the
project. Non-sector capital contribution (Cr$0.4 billion) were also well
below (-73%) levels expected at appraisal (Cr$1.7 billion); but they
constituted only a small part (4.4%) of the original financing program.
According to CEEE, contributions from the state of Rio Grande do Sul
amounted to only US$14.0 million during the years 1980-1984, not US$14
million annually, as covenanted. Neither the state government nor the
national Government complied with their respective covenants to provide
sufficient funding to complete the project.

5.4 Susnens on of Disbursements and Cancellation
5.4.1    In 1984, the Bank suspended disbursements on Loan 1824-BR pending
the receipt of a satisfactory pian of financial reMtbilitation because
CSEE, the state of Rio Grande do Sul, and the national Government failed to
comply with important financial covenants of the loan, project, and
guarantee agreements (respectively, sections 4.03, 2.02, and 2.02) (para.
3.2.1). In addition to failure to comply with various covenants, tlis
decision reflected the long and unsuecessful effort of the Bank to obtain a
satisfactory plan of financial rehabilitation for CEEE during 1982, 1983,
and early 1984 (Annex 3.7, paras. 5-8). After the formal suspension of
disbursements (August 15, 1984) and after intensivo discussions with EB,
DNAEE, the state government and the national Government, CEEE submitted
two financial plans (dated August 21 and December 21, 1984) which the Bank
judged to be unsatisfactory as they failed to show a clear trend of
financial rehabilitation and to include adequate commitments of equity
financing from the shareholder and the national Government. Such financing
became very important to the financial rehabilitation of CEEE, given the
earlier shortfalls of transfers from the Global Guarantee Fund. On April
18, 1985, CEEE sent a revised plan which included high levels of borrowing
judged to be unrealistic by the Bank; and in May 1985, CEEE provided a plan
which reflected large equity contributions from the shareholder, the
national Government, and ELETROBRAS. However, CEEE was not successful in
obtaining commitments for such equity contributions. It appeared to Bank
staff that, in addition to financial constraints, political tension between
the state government and the national Government played a role in CEEE's
lack of success. When it became obvious that CEEE could not obtain
agreement for a satisfactory plan, the Bank cancelled the loan (September
30, 1985).
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.1 A Comparison of Actual and Planned Results
6.1.1    An assessment of institutional performance should begin with a
comparison of planned and actual results for the project. During project
preparation (para. 2.2.5), it was expected that the loan would: (a) provide
a portion of sector financing; (b) help to mobilize long-term funds from
other financing agencies; (c) promote rational tariff policies enabling
sufficient self-financing for the sector; (d) help to strengthen the
management and planning of power companies; (e) reduce the operating
expenses of CEEE; (f) provide EB with an opportunity to develop its prcject
appraisal/supervision capabilities; and (g) extend power supply to unserved
or underserved areas.
6.1.2    With respect to (a), the Bank provided the sector a portion of its
financing with this loan, but at a level (US$ 40.4 million) much lower than
planned (para. 3.2.1). With respect to (b), CEEE was able to mobilize
long-term funding from other financing agencies (para. 5.3.3) without
difficulty. Bank staff felt that the association of the Bank with the
project did very little to assist CEEE in obtaining such borrowing. Actual
results fell far short of expected results with respect to (c)
(paras.5.2.5-.10). Concerning (d), there is insufficient information to
assess the results of the institutional-improvement study (para. 3.4.3);
but Bank staff were dissatisfied with the quality of financial planning by



- 17 -
CEEE's financial administration (para. 3.5.1). Concerning (e), CEEE made
progress in lowering operating costs (para. 5.3.2). With respect to
developing the project appraisal/supervision capabilities of EB (f), the
results show that, given the financial problems of the sectot, the narrow
technical approach was inadequate for the task. Concerning (g), CEEE added
about 439,000 new customers between 1980 and 1984; but did not complete the
project and did not cokinect as many low-income customers as expected
(para.3.3.1). As to the study of efficiency criteria used by DNAEE (which
was not part of the definition of the project), the Bank did not carry out
an assessment of its impact on the operations of DNAEE (para. 3.4.2);
however, given the reduced status of DNAEE within the sector (para. 1.2.2),
the importance and impact of this study may have become moot.
6.2 National Government
6.2.1    The national Government honored the sector revenue agreements of
1981 and 1983; but the high rate of inflation overwhelmed the Government
effort to maintain or to improve the real level of tariffs (para. 5.2.4).
By holding down tariffs, the national Government weakened the autonomy and
financial condition of the sector which was also adversely affected by
recession and devaluation. The national Government, because of its tariff
policies, precipitated conditions which made it impossible to complete the
project (para. 5.3.2). The national Government contributed to project
delays because of slow action in providing import licenses (para. 3.3.4).
The state government and the national Government did not comply with their
respective covenants to supply sufficient financing to complete this
project in the event that CEEE was unable to provide such financing.
Despite its financial deterioration, the power sector continues to be well
managed, with a better than average performance in satisfying an extremely
rapid market growth, and with good investment planning.
6.3 The Borrower
6.3.1    The borrower was unable to complete the project because of a
shortfall of counterpart financing (para. 3.2.1). The shortfall primarily
reflected reduced levels of transfer payments from the Global Guarantee
Fund (para. 5.3.2), which was due to the deteriorated financial position of
the sector and the tariff policies of the Government (para. 5.2.4-8.).
Also playing a role in the actual shortfall of counterpart financing was
the low level of equity contributions (para. 5.3.3). However, the lack of
federal and state commitment to provide such financing heavily influenced
the negative judgement of the Bank on the financial rehabilitation plan
prepared by CEEE (para. 5.4.1). The level of transfer payments and equity
contributions were outside the control of CEEE.
6.3.2    Political considerations played an excessive role in hiring (and
firing of staff in key management positions; and contributed to unnecessary
friction with the national Government (para. 3.4.1). Concerning
institutional improvements, Bank staff believe that administrative problems
reflected in CEEE's inability to prepare satisfactory financial projections
continue; but they have carried out no recent assessment. Notwithstanding
its financial problems, CEEE extended its service in an impressive manner
and reduced staff (para. 1.3.2), and lowered operating costs (para. 5.3.2).



- 18 -
6.4 The Bank
6.4.1    At appraisal, Bank staff proposed conditionalities appropriate to
the situation of CEEE and the sector (Annex 3.7, pars. 3; paras. 2.1.11,
2.2.2 and 2.2.5). The frequency and extent of technical supervision was in
proportion to most of the needs of the project (Annex 3.7). The same was
true with respect to financial supervision. However, inadequate attention
was given to the progress and implementation of the various studies after
1982.
6.4.2    Faced with non-compliance by the national Government with respect
to revenue covenants during the late 1970's and early 1980's, the Bank took
an understanding attitude toward the changed conditinres of the Brazilian
economy, and accordingly renegotiated in 1981 and .983 new sector revenue
agreements (paras. 5.2.2-.10). Given the deteriorated ard changed
condition of the Brazilian economy, this was a reasonab1a approach and
indicated flexibility on the part of Bank staff.
VII. LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
7.1 A Shortfall of Results
7.1.1    Due to factors outside of its control, CEEE lacked sufficient
counterpart financing to complete the project (para. 6.3.1). Given the
limitations on financial resources available to CEEE due to the
deteriorated state of sector finances and the higher priority accorded
other elements of its investment program, this result should not be
surprising.
7.1.2    During project preparation and during negotiations for loan
1824-BR, the Bank attempted to address the financial situation of the
sector, including the level of tariffs, as well as the problems of CEEE
(para. 6.4.1). The same approach prevailed in connection with other
specific loans processed in 1979 and 1980. Through the loan agreement for
loan 1824-BR, the Bank obtained commitment to financial covenants which
could reasonably be expected to lead to the improvement of the financial
situation of CEEE, other power borrowers, and the sector. The approach of
seeking a sector-wide result through a loan to a specific operating company
was reasonable, given the fact of uniform national tariffs and the
expectation of compliance with revenue covenants. However, when the
approach failed, the Bank tried a new approach -- namely, negotiating
agreements with sector-wide applicability. This new approach may
constitute a lesson to be learned: for problems of a specific company
which have a sector origin, a sector approach may be the most efficient way
of addressing such problems.

BRAZIL
CEEE POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
COMPANHIA ESTADUAL DE ENERGIA ELETRICA (CEEE)
Findinas of Pre-Appraisal Mission
1.       In December 1978, the first pre-appraisal mission visited CEEE.
As CEEE had not completed at this time justifying important program items
or supplying data on the financial forecasts, the project brief (second
version, dated January 8, 1979) did not include detailed information on the
definition of the program, the project, their respective costs, or the size
of the proposed Bank loan. To expedite project preparation, the Bank
decided, as a condition for appraisal, to require justification for only
those project items scheduled for completion by December 1981, leaving
justification of the remaining portion of the project as a condition for
disbursement after mid-1980.
2.       After further consideration of the high level of CEEE operating
expenses (para. 2.1.4), the mission recommended that DRAEE explain the
rationale of its criteria for excluding from recovery certain operating
costs of CEEE. The Bank requested DNAEE to supply such a report and urged
CEEE to prepare financial projections which conformed to such criteria.
3.       These requests reflected the broader Bank concern over the
deteriorating financial performance of its power borrowers, which, due to
inadequate tariff increases, had been unable to comply with the revenue
covenants of their respective loan agreements since 1977. Consistent with
Brazilian tariff legislation, these revenue covenants required revenue
levels sufficient for the power borrowers to earn a minimum of 10 annually
on their remunerable asset base.1 In 1978, the return of the sector on
1/ The revenue covenants of most IBRD loan agreements for power projects
require calculation of the rate of return by relating net income for
the subject year to the average of net fixed assets in operation at the
beginning and end of the corresponding year. The revenue covenants of
IBRD loan agreements with Brazilian power borrowers are consistent with
Brazilian legislation which calls for a remunerable rate base including
elements either different from or additional to those defined in IBRD
loan agreements. Those elements include: (1) average net fixed assets
in operation established on a time weighted basis (rather than an
arithmetic average based on values at the beginning and end of the
year); (ii) an allowance for working capital; and (iii) the accumulated
revenue shortfall of prior years.   Additionally, taxes paid by the
sector but which are reinvested in the sector are treated as operating
costs. If the rate of return were to be measured in the more
conventional manner, it would be    1-22 higher than under the methods
now being followed.



- 20 -
ANNEX 2.1

remunerable assets was 8.62; and none of the Bank power borrowers earned
102 on remunerable assets. Given this serious situation (which would
worsen in 1979), the Bank, in connection with this and other loans, sought
tariff actions and agreements on the part of the Government to effect
financial restoration (including recovery of past revenue shortfalls) and
compliance with existing covenants.
4.       During February, March, and April 1979, Bank and CEEE staff
narrowed the areas of uncertainty surrounding physical quantities, costs,
and technical and economic justification of the program and the project.
Moreover, as a result of processing another power loan, Bank staff became
increasingly preoccupied with the effect of regulation and inadequate
tariff levels on the finances of CEEE and other power companies . In these
circumstances, the Bank decided to defer consideration of the proposed loan
to fiscal year 1980.
5.       In April 1979, a second pre-appraisal mission found that the CEEE
rate of remuneration (3.12) for 1978 had deteriorated as compared with the
rates for 1977 and 1976 (respectively 8.1% and 5.92). The low rate
reflected DNAEE objections to the high level of CEEE labor costs and asset
values, the latter considered to be inflated. The Bank expressed its
concern over the low rate; and urged CEEE to agree with DNAEE on asset
values and a cost improvement program as the basis for financial
projections.
6.       A third preappraisal mission (June 1979) provided the first
estimates of the costs of the project and of the program for 1979-1983
(respectively, US$300 million and US$1,746 million) (Attachment 1). Non-
sector capital contributions (US$180 millions), including contributions
from an unidentified source (US$109 millions) and the state of Rio Grande
do Sul (US$71 millions), would be central to the financing plan. The
mission anticipated a covenant obligating the state of Rio Grande do Sul to
make equity contributions to CEEE, but carried out no assessment of the
capacity of the state to provide funds in the amounts required.
7.       The mission paid special attention to financial projections which
reflected discussions with DNAEE on a possible program for lowering labor
costs and future tariff increases -- that is, DNAEE verbally agreed to
authorize returns of 62 in 1979 and 102 annually thereafter if CEEE
reduced its operating expenses by 10% in 1981. The mission was especially
interested to ensure, through appropriate covenants, an adequate level of
consumer-based financial support for the investment program. In view of
this agreement, a mission appraised the proposed project at the end of June
1979.

BRAZIL
COMPANHIA ESTADUAL DE ENERGIA ELETRICA (CEEE)
CEEE POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
Supervision Frequency and Findinas
1.       A total of nine supervision mission visited CEEE.  Financial and
technical supervision occur-ed annually between 1980 and 1982; five
missions visited CEEE during this period. After 1982, there was no further
technical supervision, only financial supervision (four missions) in 1984
and 1986. The following summarizes the findings and recommendations of the
ten supervision missions.
2.       Notwithstanding some initial delay due to market developments --
recession had sloxed sales growth in 1980 -- the first technical
supervision mission (August 1980) expressed its satisfaction with the
revised project timetable and procurement arrangements; and expected CEEE
to complete the project by Y-irch 31, 1984, as scheduled. The first
financial supervision mission (October 1980) reported deterioration in the
financial performance of CEEE and the sector in 1980 as compared to what
had been covenanted; and recommended that the Bank condition proposed loans
to EB to enactment by March 1, 1981 of a program of tariff adjustments
sufficient to allow the sector to earn a remunerable return of 101 in 1981.
3.       Eight months (March 1981) after the loan agreement became
effective, the Bank instructed CEEE as to the format and content of project
progress reports. Bank files do rot indicate why such instruction had not
been sent to CEEE at an earlier date.
4.       In May 1981, a financial supervision mission notel a project-
implementation delay of about one year. Part of this delay was due to
confusion in bid evaluation procedures; part was due to a continuing slow
down in market growth; and part was due to further erosion of CEEE
finances. The mission warned that financial deterioration could further
delay the project; and supported consideration of the suspension of all
power loans to Brazil pending the correction of a sector default on revenue
levels. The Bank and the Government agreed on a sector financial
rehabilitation plan in November 1981. The development of additional
sector financial rehabilitation plans is discussed at length below (paras.
8-10) and in Chapter 5.
5.       While confirming that implementation of the project was about a
year behind schedule, the second technical supervision mission (October
1981) reported that CEEE expectad to overcome a good part of the delay
during the next year. The mission confirmed that such progress was
possible technically, provided that adequate funding were available.  As
the Government agreed to a sector financial rehabilitation plan in November
1981 (para. 5.2.8), it was reasonable for Bank staff to anticipate such
funding.

6.       In September 1982, a combined technical-financial supervision
mlsbion reported that: (i) the problem of implementation delay remained
about the same, i.e., one year; (ii) reduced market growth justified some
reduction in the project; and (1ii) CEEE was benefitting from exceptionally
low priced which would probably result in an unused loan surplus of about
US$5.0 million. The mission also reported that the financial status of
CEEE was poor due to low levels *f sales, tariffs, and state contributions.
The mission recommended that the Bank seek a financial rehabilitation plan.
7.       The financial deterioration of CEEE and the sector continued in
1982 and through the summer of 1983, leading the Government and the Bank to
amend (November 1983) the 1981 agreement on sector tariffs and revenues
(paras. 5.2.9-.10). Financial supervision of CEEE occurred within .the
context of continuing dialogue on sector finances. In January 1984, a
mission reported that CEEE was "technically" bankrupt, as it had no
prospect of covering its debt service requirements in coming years even if
the amended sector financial rehabilitation plan were implemented as
expected; and and that neither EB nor the government of Rio Grande do Sul
were prepared to commit themselves to equity contributions on the scale
required to fund the CEEE investment program. The Bank accepted the
mission recommendation to require the submission of a satisfactory company
financial rehabilltation plan which enjoyed the agreement and support of
CEEE, EB, DNAEE, SEPLAN, and the state government. The Bank established
April 30, 1984 as the deadline for the submission of such plan. CEEE agreed
not to submit further disbursement applications.
8.       During subsequent months, the state and national power authorities
failed to resolve their differences as to the size of their respective
equity contributians; and CEEE failed to provide a satisfactory financial
rehabilitation plan. On July 16, 1984, the Bank warned CEEE that it would
suspend disbursements if it did not receive a satisfactory rehabilitation
plan by August 10, 1984. Having failed to receive the plan, on August 15,
1984, the Bank formally suspended disbursements.
9.       In October 1984, a financial supervision mission reviewed a plan
provided by CEEE on August 25, 1984. On the basis of conversations with
EB, DNAEE, SEST, CEEE, and the state government, the mission judged the
plan to be unacceptable, as it would not lead to a qatisfactory improvement
of CEEE finances. The mission expressed its doubts about the ability of the
state government to contribute amounts larger than those already committed,
given their failure to meet earlier commitments. The mission recommended
that the Bank set a new deadline for the submission of a satisfactory plan;
and that if CEEE were unable to meet this deadline, the Bank should cancel
the undisbursed balance of the loan.
10.      As state and federal power authorities remained deadlocked, CEEE
could not produce a satisfactory rehabilitation. Two additional missions
(March and June 1985) confirmed that no plan would be forthcoming. Given
this situation, the Bank cancelled the loan on June 19, 1985.
