MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A SECOND HIGHER EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development loan to the Government of Indonesia (GOI) for US$150 million
equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would have a term of
20 years, including a grace period of 5 years, at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate, and would finance a three-year time-slice of the higher
education expenditure program, excluding previously committed foreign-assisted
and purely GOI-financed projects. The GOI intends to seek a loan of US$9.6
million from the Government of Japan (GOJ) to cofinance Environmental Study
Centers (ESCs) included in the proposed project.
2.        Background.  Enrollment in primary and secondary schools in
Indonesia has increased 5-6 times in the last 20 years. Enrollment in higher
education has grown almost as much in only 10 years, despite severe cuts in
all educational development budgets during 1985-88 caused by lower oil prices.
The budgetary situation has now improved substantially, although Indonesia
still spends a lower percentage of GDP (3.1%) on education than other
countries in a similar stage of development (typically 4-5X). The GOI intends
to spend about US$1.4 billion on higher education during the last three years
of REPELITA V (1991192-1993/94) corresponding to a 40? increase over the
previous three years. It is a major objective of the GOI to expand and
improve higher education to =;p-ort economic development. Presently, about
554,000 students, of whom around 402 are women, are enrolled in 45 public
universities and four art institutes, and about 1,010,000 students are
enrolled in 850 private universities. Enrollment in public universities is
expected to increase little, whereas private enrollment is expected to grow
about 10% annually in the coming y irs. The main issues in the higher
education subsector, which were idcttified in the first Higher Education
Development Project (HEDP I), include: (a) low quality and inefficiency in
university teaching and research; (b) imbalance between industrial needs for
professional and technical manpower and the fields of study chosen by
university students; and (c) weak planning, institutional management, and
implementation capability in large parts of the subsector. In spite of
substantial progress already made by GOI, these issues still need to be
addressed.
3.        The Government's Subsector Strategy.  The GOI's development strategy
focuses on: (a) educational quality and efficiency -- raising university
teacher qualifications, improving university-based research, and fully
developing the Inter-university Centers (IUCs) and a national university
library network; (b) human resource needs -- supporting secondary school
science teacher training, improving education in basic science and engineering
at public and private universities and polytechnics, developing environmental
education and research, and strengthening postgraduate training and research,
particularly in science and technology; and (c) planning and management --
developing the administrative staffs in universities and the Directorate
General for Higher Education (DGHE), expanding and improving a management



-2-
information system (MIc), carrying out planning and management studies, and
supporting project implementation.
4.        Until 1990, public universities had little autonomy in planning and
budgeting. In July 1990, the Government passed a decree granting autonomy to
public universities in financial management, academic programming, and
institutional organization. Financial autonomy will allow universities to
retain income from student tuition, research, services and consultancies, and
other sources. Academic autonomy will permit public universities to design
and offer study programs based upon their individual perception of national
and local priorities, and institutional autonomy will enable them to devise
the organizational structures considered best suited to their individual
needs.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank has been closely
associated with the development of Indonesia's higher education subsector
since 1977 through a series of Bank-assisted projects. Until 1987, the Bank's
involvement in the higher education subsector consisted of support for
selected programs which were considered deficient in educational quality or
quantity of output. Also, new programs, such as the polytechnics and the IUCs
for postgraduate training, were initiated with Bank assistance. As a result
of a joint GOI-Bank analysis of subsectoral issues and policies, the Bank's
strategy changed towards support for the whole subsector, especially in policy
matters and resource management. This was clearly reflected in HEDP I
(1988/89 - 1990/91), which provided assistance during the last year of
REPELITA IV and the first two years of REPELITA V to most areas of higher
education, with an emphasis on the academic, financial, institutional and
policy framework of the subsector. As a major source for financing higher
education in Indonesia during the 1980s, the Bank is well placed to corcinue
to support in these important areas during the remaining three years of
REPELITA V.
6.        Project Objective and Description.  The objective of the proposed
project is to provide further support for the GOI's efforts to implement its
higher eaucation subsectoral strategy through the following components, most
of which were initiated and successfully implemented under HEDP I:
(a)  Improvement of Quality and Efficiency through:  (i) academic staff
development, involving about 8,500 fellows from public and private
universities in overseas and in-country degree programs at the
master's (S2) and doctoral (S3) levels and about 1,000 fellows in
non-degree programs; (ii) support for public and private university
research on a competitive basis, including both research grants and
research guidance, with particular emphasis on science and
technology; (iii) support for the IUCs; and (iv) support for the
development of university libraries, including a national library
network;
(b)  Meeting Human Resource Needs through:  (i) strengthening secondary
school science teacher training, (ii) strengthening undergraduate
and postgraduate education in mathematics and natural sciences;
(iii) support for four science and technology centers which would



_3-
provide laboratory and library space for private university
students; (iv) support for the accelerated engineering program in
key disciplines at selected universities; (v) consolidation of
polytechnics; (vi) upgrading of 12 ESCs, expected to be partly
financed through the loan from the GOJ; and (vii) support for
physical facilities for agriculture, engineering, and a pre-medical
program at three universities; and
(c)  Improvement of Planning and Management through:  (i) management
training for university administrators and key staff of the DGHE,
with special regard to the issues related to the recently announced
autonomy for public universities; (ii) further development of the
MIS; (iii) conducting several policy and evaluation studies,
including a comprehensive study of university graduates and a study
on private higher education development strategy; and
(iv) strengthening the capacity of the Central Project
Implementation Unit (CPIU).
7.        Actions Agreed.  During negotiations, the GOI has agreed to:
(a) implement the project in accordance with the Higher Education Program
Guidelines and the related Action Plan as agreed with the Bank; (b) ensure
that the ESCs become integrated into the academic and organizational structure
of the host universities; (c) strengthen the CPIU to handle increased
responsibilities; and (d) undertake an annual review with the Bank of the
current and forthcoming year's expenditure programs.
8.        Benefits.  The proposed project would help continue and enhance the
policy reforms initiated under HEDP I. This would lead to: (a) higher
academic standards and improved teaching and research in public and private
universities, with some 8,500 new master's or doctoral degree holders; (b)
increased support for national economic development through quantitative and
qualitative improvements in science teacher training and skilled personnel
development in science and technology; (c) improved support for
environmentally sound development; and (d) improved planning and management,
both locally and centrally in the DGHE, through training programs and
improvements in the MIS.
9.        Risks.  There are no major risks.  All components, except the ESCs,
are a continuation of activities supported under HEDP I or other Bank-assisted
projects. The CPIU and local staff are thus experienced in the implementation
of project activities. The implementation of the ESC component would be
supported by the CPIU and by qualified international experts over the whole
project period, thereby mitigating the risk related to this new component.



10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement by the Bankc and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
