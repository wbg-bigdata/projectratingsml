      (a)   the term "eligible Categories" means the Categories set
forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this Agreement;
      (b)   the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures in
respect of the reasonable cost of goods and services required for
the Project and to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan

lent to $15,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and

Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible expenditures
in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.

the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the Autho-

Account may be made as follows:
      (a)   On the basis of a request or requests by the Borrower

Account such amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.
      (b)   The Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for

Account for eligible expenditures. All such deposits shall be
withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account under the respective
eligible Categories, and in the respective equivalent amounts, as
shall have been justified by the evidence supporting the request for
such deposit furnished pursuant to paragraph 4 of this Schedule.

Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further deposits
into the Special Account:

further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly from the

General Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this
Agreement; or
      (b)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan less the
amount of any outstanding special commitment entered into by the
Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect
to the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of
the Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan shall follow such procedures as the
Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further with-

Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A)
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B)
deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request,
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or
the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the
Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
      (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such
outstanding amount.
      (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the
Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special
Account.
      (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a),
Page  13
(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account
for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in accordance with the
relevant provisions of this Agreement, including the General
Conditions.
