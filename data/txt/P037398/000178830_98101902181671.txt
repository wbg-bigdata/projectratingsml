INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY BOARD
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF IRELAND
FOR THE THIRD POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) with the guarantee of Ireland, for the
equivalent of US$15 million to help finance the supply and installation of a
single 250 MW oil-fired generation unit and associated equipment. The loan
would have a term of 17 years, including five years of grace, with interest
at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        Ireland joined the Bank in August 1957 and became member of IFC in
September 1958. It is an original member of IDA. Although a Part II country,
Ireland has offered to contribute $4 million to the third IDA replenishment,
bringing its total IDA participation to date to $7 million.
3.        The proposed loan would be the Bank's fifth operation in Ireland,
and the third loan for power. The Bank began lending to Ireland only in 1969,
having previously considered that Ireland had a strong enough economic and fi-
nancial position to raise by itself sufficient capital on reasonable terms to
meet its development needs. However Ireland's public capital program grew
rapidly in the late 1960's, and became reflected in a substantially increased
resource gap. At the same time, despite continuing efforts to borrow abroad
on a much enlarged scale, Ireland experienced considerable difficulty in
raising the increasing amounts required. Consequently, the Bank agreed to
consider a limited lending program to assist Ireland in overcoming its imme-
diate resource constraints and to support needed investments in key sectors.
4.        Bank lending focused at the beginning on the power sector, where a
capital shortage might otherwise have delayed the long-run electrification
program. Two loans were made to ESB: one in FY 1969 amounting to $14.5 mil-
lion, a second in FY 1971 amounting to $20 million. Progress under these
loans has been entirely satisfactory, and there are no outstanding problems.
These investments provided a much-needed addition to the economic infrastruc-
ture, and the Bank's financial participation in ESB had the additional bene-
fit of encouraging ESB to diversify its own financing sources. Formerly, ESB
had satisfied its capital needs by relying exclusively on long-term repayable
advances from the Government and on bond issues in the domestic capital mar-
ket. Since the first Bank loan, however, ESB has increasingly met its grow-
ing capital requirements through borrowing on foreign capital markets and by
using supplier credits, and the proposed loan is intended to be the last Bank
loan to ESB.



5.        In FY 1971 and FY 1972, the Bank extended its operations to indus-
tr-- and education. Ireland's rapid industrial growth and adaptation was sup-
ported by a $10 million loan to The Industrial Credit Company,,Limited (ICC).
A loan of $13"million was made to assist the implementation of a major educa-
tion reform. A-summary statement of Bank loans to Ireland is attached at
Annex I.
6.        The,-future role of the Bank in assisting Irish development should
be considered&An the light of Ireland's changing circumstances -- most
particularly the imminence of its entry into the E.E.C. While these develop-
ments-.should result inma reduction of the resource gap over time, the need to
adapt to new.competitive conditions will call for major structural reforms
and policy-,changes that will have to be planned with foresight.and carefully.
undertaken.   The government will continue to borrow in private capital markets
whenever possible but attaches importance to obtaining some assistance from,
the Bank duriing. this period.
7.        Future Bank -lending will be in support of reform in agriculture,
industry and.-.education -- sectors crucial for Ireland's adaptation to the
E.E.C.  Bank operationsuin agriculture will aim at the development of the
beef cattle industry, and.reform of the present system of subsidies and
taxation. Lending to industry will aim at the establishment of adequate
credit channels for long-term capital, and support measures to attract for-
eign investment, and develop larger and economically viable enterprises
which are internationally competitive. In education, the emphasis..of the
Bank's lending is directedc to reform in agricultural and technical educa-
tion, and toimproving the training of unskilled and skilled labor.      In.
FY 1973 the Bank is considering a livestock project and a second loan to
ICC.  IFC has not invested in Ireland so far, and no projects are present-
ly under consideration.
8.        The third power project was appraised in April 1971.     A subsequent
visit in August 1971 was necessary to reappraise the project in,view of changes
in ESB's financial projections. Negotiations for the proposed loan were held
in Washington in January 1972. The borrower's delegation was headed by Mr.
L. J. Barry, Director, (Finance) of ESB. The negotiator for the Guarantor was
Mr. Sean F. Murray, Assistant Secretary in the Department of Finance.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
9.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Ire-
land" will be distributed to the Executive Directors in March 1972. An
Economic Data Sheet and a Social Indicators Sheet are attached as Annex II.
10.       The 1960's was a decade of marked progr,ess for the Irish economy,
especially when seen against the background.of stagnation and heavy emigra-
tion characterizing the 1950's.   The first two years of the 1970's haue been.
difficult, but now the outlook is more favorable, largely because of Ireland's
prospective entry into the E.E.C. in January 1973. The principal short-run



problem is to bring inflation under control. In the longer run, Ireland
needs to provide more employment in industry and to continue to foster ex-
ports.
11.       Recent disturbances in Northern Ireland have had an adverse impact
on tourism and may have contributed to the current sluggishness in private
investment. Another effect has been some diversion of Government's attention
from matters of economic policy. This situation may lead the Government to
defer taking some necessary but possibly unpopular actions on the economic
side.
12.       GNP growth, which had averaged 4 percent annually In the 1960's,
slowed to 1-1/2 percent in 1970 but recovered to 3 percent in 1971. Unem-
ployment rose from about 6 percent in the 1960's to over 7 percent in
1970/71. The increase in consumer prices accelerated from 4 percent an-
nually in the period 1965-68 to about 7-1/2 percent in 1969 and over 8 per-
cent in 1970, in large part reflecting a rise in unit wage costs of more
than 20 percent in the two year period 1969-70. Since these rises were
greater even than in the U.K. (which purchases two-thirds of Irish exports
and supplies more than half of Irish imports), there was some weakening
of Ireland's competitive position. 'Export growth remained steady, but the
weakened position of import competing industries contributed both to the
slowdown of economic activity and to the widened external deficit in these
years.
13.       The principal instrument in the Government's efforts to control
inflation is a national wage agreement which was negotiated in 1970 under
a Government threat to impose compulsory restraints. This agreement has
helped to reduce the number of strikes (a principal cause of the 1970 re-
cession) and to slow the previously accelerating rate of wage increases.
Nevertheless, the rate of inflation in 1971 continued in the order of 8-9
percent, as the effect of the agreement has not yet been fully realized.
14.       The Government's present preoccupation with the problem of cost
inflation is well-placed,in view of both the openness of the Irish economy
(imports constitute over 40 percent of GDP) and the imminence of Ireland's
entry into E.E.C. However, it is questionable whether the national wage
agreement which has in any case to be renegotiated in mid-1972 will improve
Ireland's cost competitiveness unless it is reinforced by other measures.
15.       The inflation was also fueled on the demand side by rapidly rising
Government expenditures up until the 1971 budget, which was considerably more
restrained. Although current revenues have increased substantially over the
years, the goal has traditionally been to meet the rapidly rising demand for
current expenditure. The rate of Government savings through the budget has
thus remained relatively low, with heavy reliance on borrowing to finance
public service capital expenditures.
16.       The ability of the Irish authorities to conduct an effective mone-
tary policy has been limited in the past by the close ties of the Irish and



-4-
the U.K. monetary systems. Credit guidelines and a measure of moral suasion
14ave constituted the main policy instruments but these have not proven to be
very effective. Ireland's financial structure has become more diversified
and responsive in recent years, and a Central Bank Act passed in 1971 now
gives the authorities considerably broadened powers to implement monetary
policy.
17.       The prospects for the immediate future are somewhat mixed.    Exports
are continuing to grow.rapidly, though tourism is likely to remain depressed
as long as the Northern difficulties persist. Foreign investment is conti-
roing, but overall investment demand remains weak.    The number of jobs lost
in industry in 1971 was twice as high as in 1970, and the unemployment rate
is now about 8 percent. Labor relations are improved, but prices are cur-
rently rising faster than was hoped for. In order to reduce the excess ca-
pacity in the economy, selected measures were taken in late 1971 to stimulate
activity. The current account deficits in 1971 and 1972 are likely to prove
-in the order of E80 million or so (compared to £64 million in 1970), but re-
serves still rose substantially in 1971 to reach more than 6 months' import
equivalent. In the light of these developments, Ireland has informed the
Bank of its intention to purchase an additional $6 million of IBRD two-year
Central Bank issues to increase its holding to $16 million. It is expected
at this time that Ireland's holdings of such bonds will be renewed in the
future unless unforeseen balance of payments' pressures should arise.
18.       Ireland's most important economic objective in the coming years is
to prepare for its entry into the E.E.C. Negotiations with E.E.C. have been
concluded and a referendum will be held in Ireland in the spring of 1972.
Ireland would become a member in January 1973, with a five year period of
transition to full membership status. Although the immediate goal of econ-
omic policy must be to bring the persistent inflationary pressure under con-
trol, in the longer run, Ireland aims at: (a) reducing the still high rates
of unemployment and emigration through the creation of more jobs, especially
in export industries; (b) the provision of more social services, on the
British model; and (c) the reduction of regional and sectoral disparities in
incomes. This implies a solution of structural problems in agriculture and
diversification of industrial development. Thus, Ireland's development
strategy for the 1970's will continue to emphasize export expansion, foreign
investment, industrial growth, and adaptation to an increasingly competitive
trading environment.
19.       The short-run effects of Ireland's membership in the E.E.C. will in-
clude an increase in agricultural incomes, substantial budget savings, and im-
provement in the balance of payments through expanded agricultural exports at
much higher prices. On the other hand, membership will raise domestic food
prices and create difficulties for Irish firms unable to compete with European
producers. However, the most efficient industries will benefit from access to
an enlarged market, and access to this market should also enhance the attrac-
tiveness of Ireland to European, Japanese and American investors. The E.E.C.'s
recognition of Ireland as a less developed member of the Community has been
reflected in the agreement to allow Ireland to retain its present system of
export and investment incentives. Ireland can also expect to benefit over time
from the financial and technical assistance available from E.E.C. sources and



-5-
to receive the special advantages that may become available under the E.E.C.'s
emerging policy of assistance to the less developed regions within the Commu-
nity.
20.       Although Ireland's trade deficit (in constant prices) will rise
steadily in the coming years, the improved terms of trade should largely off-
set these increases. Thus, economic growth is not likely to be constrained
by the balance of payments so much as in the past. Rather, growth will be
limited by the socio-economic problems of agriculture and by the need to
adapt industry to the new conditions. There is a particular need for reform
and development of agriculture including changes in land tenure, size of
farms and agricultural taxation. Much has been done by Irish industry to
prepare for progressively freer trade, but there is a need for further ini-
tiatives in promoting mergers, expanding training and adaptation programs,
improving marketing, and consolidating responsibility for industrial policy.
21.       Rapid growth in the 1970's (5 percent or above) and full employment
by 1980 appear as feasible objectives. It remains for the Government to for-
mulate the necessary program, providing the design of development for the
transition to full membership in the E.E.C.
22.       Despite substantial increases in public foreign borrowing in re-
cent years, Ireland's external public debt remains quite low. As of Decem-
ber 31, 1970, this amounted to $431 million (of which $354 million was dis-
bursed). Interest and amortization payments on this debt amounted to only
about 2 percent of exports of goods and non-factor services in 1970. This
debt service ratio is expected to remain below 5 percent at least through
1977. Thus, with its excellent payment record and its small debt service,
Ireland's creditworthiness is not in question.
PART III - THE PROJECT
23.       The electric power system in Ireland has been expanding at a rate
of about 10 percent annually over the past decade and the industrial use of
electricity has been growing even faster. In spite of this rapid growth,
per capita electricity consumption in Ireland is one of the lowest in Europe.
For example, Ireland's per capita consumption is only 40 percent that of the
U.K.
24.       Because of continuing industrial and other development, the demand
for electricity is expected to continue to grow at an average rate of 10 per-
cent per year. An adequate supply of electric power to meet this expected
growth is necessary if Irish manufacturers are to compete effectively in the
E.E.C. and Ireland is to continue to attract foreign investors. The Elec-
tricity Supply Board (ESB) has therefore planned extensive expansion in the
1970's.
The Electricity Supply Board
25.       ESB is an autonomous statutory corporation and is the sole agency
providing public electricity supply in Ireland. Since its establishment in



- 6 -
1927 under the Electricity (Supply) Act, ESB has progressively expanded and
is now one of' the largest enterprises in the country.   It is well established
with a competent management and efficient staff.
26.       In April 1971 ESB had an installed generating capacity of 1,436 MW,
of which 220 MT were in hydro, 407 MW were in peat-fired, an'd 809 MW were in
coal and oil-fired plants. Generating stations and load centers are intercon-
nected by an extensive 220 KV and 110 KV grid.
27.      'In order to meet the projected increase in demand,'ESB has to
double its generating capacity during the period FY 1972-FY 1978. Apart
fr-om new generating capacity already under construction the committed expan-
sion program includes 280 MW of pumped storage capacity at Turlough Hill,
financed under' Loan 591-IRE, and three 250 MW oil-fired thermal units. The
first of thesne units (Tarbert No. 3) was financed under Loan 726-IRE; the
second (Tarbett' No. 4) will be financed, in part, under the proposed loan.
Total investment during the seven years is expected to cost f234 million
(US$611 million), of which 33 percent will be for generation, 17 percent for
transmiss-ion and 50 percent for distribution.    ESB's expansion program has
been formulated in collaboration with the Northern Ireland Joint Electricity
Authority (NU'EA), which is responsible for the coordination of all power
operations in Northern Ireland. The program has been designed to provide
for the most economical use of the generating capacity of the two intercon-
nected systems.
The Project'
29.       The proposed project consists of the construction of a 250 MW oil-
fired generating unit-at Tarbert (Tarbert No. 4) and the installation of
about 100 miles of 220 KV transmission lines to link the generating' unit to
ESB's grid. Tarbert is on the south bank of the Shannon estuary in County
Kerry in western Ireland (see map attached). Two 60 MW oil-fired units are
now in operation at the site and the 250 MW Tarbert No. 3, is under construc-
tion. Tarbert No. 4 will be identical to No. 3 and is expected to be in
service in 1976.
29.       ESB's engineering staff, which has considerable experience in de-
signing and supervising the construction of large thermal'power stations, is
carrying out the engineering for Tarbert No. 3 and is capable of undertaking
the engineering of the Project without the help of consultants. The Project
is technically sound and represents the cheapest among a number of al ter-
natives considered. The internal financial rate of return on the project
would be 16 percent.
Cost and Financing
30.       The cost of the project would be $40.5 million equivalent, of which.
$23.5 million would be in foreign exchange. The proposed loan, which would
finance the foreign costs of equipment for the Tarbert No. 4 unit except for
the turbo-generator, would cover 37 percent of the total cost of the project



-7-
and 64 percent of its foreign exchange requirement.    The project's cost is 9
percent of ESB's projected expenditure on its expansion program during the
cbnstruction period (FY 1972-1977). A detailed breakdown is given in Annex
III.
31.       The cost estimate was prepared by ESB in April 1971 and has been
updated since to reflect currency realignments. The estimate is based on the
cost of similar civil engineering works now under construction, the provisions
of the options for purchasing the boiler and turbine generator (see para. 33),
and the prices that ESB is now paying for similar items of other equipment.
Adequate allowances'have been included for physical and price contingencies.
The estimated unit cost for Tarbert No. 4 of US$140/KW is reasonable.
32.       The foreign exchange cost of the project would be only partially
financed by the Bank because of ESB's ability to obtain part of its capital
requirement from other external sources. As in the last loan to the ESB,
interest on the Bank loan during construction has not been included in Bank
financing. The turbo-generator will be financed by a supplier's credit, and
the remaining expenditure will be covered from ESB's internal sources and
local borrowing.
Procurement and Disbursement
33.       As mentioned in paragraph 27, ESB has three identical 250 MW gener-
ating units in its current expansion program. When bids were invited for
Tarbert No. 3 in August 1970, ESB, with the Bank's concurrence, included a
provision for the simultaneous purchase of an additional boiler and turbo-
generator to take advantage of possible financial benefits from ordering
more than one unit at a time.   After international competitive bidding, an
order for the boilers for both Tarbert No. 3 and No. 4 (the Project) was
placed with M.A.N. of Germany, the lowest evaluated bidder.    A new evaluation
of the bids received from ten suppliers indicated that the award would not
have been affected by applying the present exchange rates.
34.       The remaining goods financed by the loan would be procured on the
basis of international competitive bidding, except for components required to
be compatible with existing equipment, and items of minor cost for which such
bidding would be impractical, the total cost of both of which should not ex-
ceed JS$500,000 equivalent. Irish manufacturers would be permitted to bid
for Bank-financed equipment with 15% preference; the value of such orders is
not likely to exceed US$1 million equivalent. Procurement arrangements are
similar to those for the last loan, No. 726-IRE.
35.       Disbursements would be made for the full foreign exchange costs of
imported equipment. For orders placed with Irish manufacturers, disburse-
ments would be made for 70 percent of the cost, representing the estimated
average foreign exchange component thereof.
Ecology
36.       No ecological problems are expected.    Cooling water is available
from the Shannon estuary; the volume required would be small in relation to



the river flow, so marine life would not be affected.    Sulphur dioxide and
other contaminants in the waste boiler gases would be dispersed by a tall,
stack, the height of which is determined by the concentrations tolerable at
gro,ind level wbhen burning oil of average sulphur content, the basis for
which has been assessed from a study of international practice.
Sinking Fund
37. -     The'covenant concerning sinking fund allocations included in the
last 7nower loan to ESB-has been repeated in the proposed loan agreement. It
requires that sinking fund provisions be adequate for the repayment.of re-
deemable stock issues by their latest redemption dates,.except that provi-
sions for issues with a term of 15 years or less may be made for a period of
15 years.  In the unlikely event that medium-term issues should exceed.20 per-
cent of the total debt outstanding, the Bank would be consulted before any
further issuescwere made. The proportion is at present 5 percent.
,SE,'s Financial Position and Tariff Covenant
38.       An-unusual feature of the Electricity (Supply) Act is that ESB is
permitted to charge ftull amortization in addition to- depreciation, which im-
plies that the revenue portion equivalent to depreciation is entirely at the
l3oard's disposal. This, together with allocations to various reserves en-
abled ,SES, to generate enough revenue to finance a reasonable,por,tion of its.
expansion program out of such funds. For this reason, rate covenants had not
been included in previous loans. Recent developments, however, seem to in-
dicate that.inflationary and other pressures on the Government could change
the situation to the disadvantage of ESB's financial viability. This is .re-
flected by the situation in FY 1971 when, in spite of unfavorable results.,
the Covernment, in an attempt to dampen inflation, refused to permit ESB to,.
raise its tariffs,.by the 10 percent requested and granted only a 7 percent.
rate increase in July 1971.   The Government indicated that future tariff ap=:
plications would be examined in the context of economic conditions and the,.
Covernment's economic policy. An explicit rate covenant is therefore pro-
posed in Section 5.05 of the Loan Agreement.
39.       This rate covenant provides that, commencing in FY 1973, the Gov-.
ernment and ESB shall set electricity tariffs so that at least 40 percent of.
1Sl3's development program over any three year period consisting of one actual,
and two forecast.years will be financed by internal cash generation, includ-.
ing capital contributions. Under this.-rate covenant, ESB's future financial.
outlook is satisfactory.. The return on net fixed assets in operation should,
lie in the 9-9.5 percent range during the construction per,.iod (1972-76). and
internal cash resources.are expected to cover 40 percent of ESB's expansion
program. As retained earnings increase, the ratio of long term.debt to total
capitalization would decline gradually from 78 percent at the end of FY 1971
to 67 percent in FY 1978. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities.
would average 1.9 throughout the period, and debt service coverage by internal
sources would vary between 1.4 and 1.7. No debt service coverage covenant has
been included in the proposed loan,because the Act insures that ESB.will .gener-
ate sufficient funds to meet debt service requirements.

PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
40.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Electricity Sup-
ply Board, the draft Guarantee Agreement between Ireland and the Bank, the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the
Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed
loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
41.       The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans for
power projects. In Section 5.05 of the draft Loan Agreement a rate covenant
has been stipulated for the first time to secure ESB's sound financial posi-
tion in the future. This rate covenant based on contributions to investment
is consistent with the Electricity (Supply) Act.
42.       T am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
43.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
