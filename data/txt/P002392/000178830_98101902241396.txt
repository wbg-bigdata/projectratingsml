all identifiable taxes.
The proposed Bank Group contribution would cover all the foreign exchange
costs estimated at $6.0 million and 52 percent of local costs, or $4.0 mil-
lion.
Project Execution
29.       Both the Northern Area and Eastern Area projects would be managed
by separate project management units responsible to the Ministry of Agricul-
ture. Such a unit already exists in the east and it would continue its
responsibility. Each project unit would have a project manager and five
distinct departments responsible for: administration and personnel; finance;
extension and training, conservation and land development and commercial
services. A new project evaluation and services unit (PESU) would be esta-
blished in the Ministry in Freetown, reporting directly to the Permanent
Secretary. It would oversee and assist the project management units in the
east and north in order to ensure: effective financial control; maintenance
of adequate accounts; proper execution of credit and farm input systems; coor-
dination with other externally financed development projects. In addition,
the project management units in the north and east would be assisted by
special project coordinating committees comprised of government and tribal



- '0 -
ieaders .from the respective areas. The main purpose of these committees will
be to involve local leaders with development efforts in respective areas.
This step is necessary in order to help continue the tempo of the rural deve-
lopment program in the post-project period. A project development committee
established under the first agriculture project would continue to assist in
overall coordination at the national level.
Agriculture Credit
30.       Prior to commencement of the proposed Eastern Area extension,
Government will establish a Farmer Finance Company to take over functions
of the revolving credit fund, which was set up as part of the first project.
Tfhe purpose of the company, based at Kenema, would be to provide continuity
for the credit fund and its subsequent expansion, to associate commercial
banks with agricultural lending, and to attract farmer equity participation.
The National Development Bank and commercial banks have expressed interest
in equity participation, directorships, provision of seasonal finance and the
secondment of a finance manager. During negotiations, assurances were given
by Government that such a company would be established before December 31,
1975. (Section 3.06 of Development Credit Agreement). In the Northern Area
project, a new revolving credit fund will be established, as in the first
phase of the Eastern project. Currently, development loans in the Eastern
Area project carry an 8 percent interest rate and seasonal loans a fixed
charge of 10 percent. To avoid discrepancies between existing and new borrow-
ers these rates would be maintained. The fixed charge of 10 percent on sea-
sonal loans corresponds to an interest rate between 15 to 20 percent per annum.
Training
31.       To implement extension and farmer support services in both projects,
a total of 104 staff in various categories would be required in the north
and 136 in the east. While most positions in the two projects would be
filled by nationals, it may be that some technical positions will have to
be filled with expatriates through international recruitment since the
country is critically short of experienced high-level technicians. The great
majority of project staff would be obtained through transfers within the
Ministry of Agriculture and from other government departments, from the com-
mercial sector or through special training courses established within the
two projects. Both project management units would train junior staff at
project training centers. The new farmer training center in the north would
have a 40-bed dormitory. It would be used for staff and farmer training on
the same basis as the successful training scheme currently underway as part
of the first project in the east. Financing for consultant services would be
provided to assist the Ministry of Agriculture in project planning, evalua-
tion and other specialist activities.
Procurement and Disbursements
32.       Procurement of vehicles, plant, equipment, fertilizers, pesticides
and tools for contracts with a value of more than US$24,000 would be through
international competitive bidding (ICB) and would have an estimated value of



- 11 -
US$1.7 million. An aggregate limit of $200,000 would be applicable for items
(equipment, tools) to be purchased through local competitive bidding of less
than $24,000 each. Contracts for the construction of buildings and houses
and the purchase of construction materials and furnishings valued at US$1.3
million would not be attractive to foreign suppliers due to their dispersed
location and the small size of individual contracts. For these items, con-
tracts would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally,
under procedures satisfactory to the Bank Group, and foreign firms and suppliers
would be eligible to bid. Road construction and improvement would be undertaken
on force account due to the shortage of suitable contractors. Wells would be
constructed by villagers using project supplied materials. Domestically manu-
factured goods would be allowed a preference of 15 percent or applicable customs
duty, whichever is lower, when comparing domestic bids with those of foreign
manufacturers. (Sections A.2 and C of Schedule 3 to the Credit Agreement.)
33.       Proceeds of the loan/credit would be disbursed over five years
and the credit would be disbursed first (details in Annex III). Retroactive
financing of up to $100,000 is recommended to permit employment of a financial
controller for the project services unit in Freetown and the project manager
and accountant for the Northern Area project.
Conditions and Assurances
34.       The Government has given assurances pertaining to such matters as
establishment of the Daru Oil Palm Company, national research policy, audited
annual accounts for the project management units, construction of crop extrac-
tion roads in the Eastern Province, policies on fertilizer and agricultural
subsidies. On the fertilizer issue the Government has agreed to reduce by
30 percent the fertilizer subsidy to project farmers and to consult with the
Association by March 31, 1976 on proposals for reducing or removing agricul-
tural subsidies in relation to product pricing policies. (Sections 3.02, 3.04,
3.05, 3.07, 3.08, 4.01-4.04 of the Credit Agreement.)
35.       In the previous Development Credit Agreement (Integrated Agriculture
Development Project, 323-SL of June 1972) provision was made (Section 3.05)
for establishment of an Agricultural Development Authority (ADA). Subse-
quently, the Government proposed, and the Association agreed, that creation
of the new institution was not required since the Ministry of Agriculture had
in the interim taken adequate steps to provide the planning and other organi-
zational functions that had originally been envisioned as a main part of the
ADA's proposed scope of activity (para 24). An appropriate amendment to the
earlier Development Credit Agreement has been incorporated into the draft
Development Credit Agreement for this project. (Article V, Credit Agreement.)
Benefits
36.       The internal economic rate of return is estimated at 26 percent
for the project as a whole. About 14,000 farmers would directly benefit from
project activities. An additional 65,000 farmers in the north and east would
indirectly benefit from better water supplies, improved trading and social



- 12 -
services due to better communications, the strengthening of government insti-
tutions and services. The annual incremental production at full development,
inclusive of the initial phase of the Eastern Area project, would be 10,500
tons of white rice, 3,200 tons of palm oil, 750 tons of palm kernels, 550
tons of cocoa and 1,100 tons of groundnuts. The net per capita income of
directly affected persons would rise in the east from $60 to $100 and in the
north from $30 to $40. The project will help reduce the absolute level of
poverty in the north, and bring the income levels in the east closer to the
national average. At full development, government direct revenues would
reach an estimated total of about Le 180,000 ($216,000) per annum through
export taxes on cocoa and palm kernels. Indirect taxation, mainly through
taxes levied on consumer goods (estimated at 12 percent of farm incomes),
could provide an additional Le 200,000 ($240,000) per annum. The value of
incremental output from the project (at international prices) is estimated
at $4.9 million annually at full development, which denotes the relief to the
balance of payments through additional exports and savings on imports.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
37.       The draft Loan Agreement between Sierra Leone and the Bank, the
draft Development Credit Agreement between Sierra Leone and the Association,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of
the Articles of Agreement, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for
in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association,
and the texts of the resolutions approving the proposed loan and credit are
being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
38.       Additional conditions of loan/credit effectiveness include:    (a) that
special bank accounts with initial payments of Le 20,000 and Le 100,000 be
established respectively for the project evaluation and services unit in the
Ministry of Agriculture and for the Northern Area project along with government
guaranteed draw down procedures; (b) that the Government establish the Northern
Area project management unit and reorganize the Eastern project management unit
with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank; (c) that the project manager
and accountant of the Northern Area project as well as the financial controller
for the project evaluation and services unit be appointed on termB and condi-
tions satisfactory to the Bank. (Sections 6.01 (b), (c) and (d) of Credit
Agreement). The Government has already initiated action for fulfilling these
conditions.
39.       I am satisfied that the proposed Loan and the proposed Development
Credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the
Association.



INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND CREDIT
TO THE GOVERNMENT OF SIERRA LEONE FOR AN
INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan and development credit, each for the equivalent of US$5.0 million, to
the Government of Sierra Leone for a second integrated agricultural develop-
ment project. The loan would have a term of 25 years, including 5 years
of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum. The development credit
would be on standard IDA terms. Amounts equivalent to about US$1.5 million
will be relent to farmers (details on channels for relending and credit
terms in paragraph 30).
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited Sierra Leone in November/December 1973
and its report (No. 494a-SL dated November 27, 1974) has been distributed to
the Executive Directors. Its principal findings, as updated in the course
of a mission visiting the country in January/February 1975, are presented
below. Annex I contains basic country data.
Growth Record
3.        The growth performance of Sierra Leone during the 1960s was reason-
ably good by West African standards, but the average GDP growth of 4.6 percent
per annum between 1964 and 1971 conceals sharp year to year fluctuations,
ranging from years of negative growth to years with a 10 percent rate of
increase. The evidence, though still incomplete, suggests that from 1971
to 1973 the economy experienced a period of stagnation. In 1974 economic
activity started to pick up but real growth in income was probably only 2 to
3 percent. Although agriculture provides a living to three quarters of the
population, the growth performance of this sector was disappointing, averag-
ing 1.6 percent over the seven years ending in 1971. Thus, growth has had
to rely largely on the mining sector, notably on diamonds, which provided
substantial internal and external resources and accounted for about two
thirds of the country's export earnings.
4.        Income inequality is pronounced, more so than generally found in
Africa: the poorest 40 percent of the population receive about 10 percent of
total income, while the richest 5 percent earn about 48 percent. Since
almost 75 percent of the population is in the rural areas, where agriculture
is the main occupation, increased productivity of smallholders is essential
for alleviating the problem of rural poverty. Accordingly, this project is
intended to assist some of the poorest farmers in the country.



5.         In an effort to help stimulate agriculture, the Government in
FY 1974/75 increased appropriations for this sector:     agriculture received
33 percent of the development budget, compared with 20 percent the previous
year.  Anxious to provide greater producer incentives, the Government also
substantially increased farmgate prices for all commodities in early 1974.
The Government's program is already showing results. Encouraged by the
incentives (guaranteed price for rice has been raised from US$3.86 a bushel
to US$6.03 a bushel) farmers have taken advantage of favorable weather to produce
a record rice crop; the goal of attaining self-sufficiency in rice could be
achieved in the near future. The new pricing policy is reducing smuggling
across the border and will lead to increased marketing of coffee and cocoa.
However, because of the long gestation period of new plantings, the full
impact of the pricing policy will only be felt over a period of time.
Five-Year Plan
6.        W4ith the assistance of INDP, machinery for economic planning has
now been established, and a five-year National Development Plan, 1974/75 to
1978/79, was adopted by the Government in August 1974. The Plan gives
priority to the agricultural sector, which is now viewed as the key to
achieving overall development objectives -- a satisfactory growth rate, more
equitable income distribution, improved living standards in rural areas and
expansion of the export base.    While export performance is expected to con-
tinue to rely heavily on mineral production -- with bauxite and rutile gra-
dually gaining in importance -- strong efforts are to be made to increase
agricultural exports, to establish agricultural processing industries and to
develop hydroelectric potential in order to reduce the country's dependence
on oil imports. The proposed project is consistent with the Government's
development priorities.
Fiscal Situation
7.        In FY 1973/74 large supplementary appropriations raised recurrent
expenditures 35 percent above the original estimates, but the budget did not
come under pressure because revenue grew by over 40 percent. High profitabi-
lity of the Diamond Corporation and strong import demand were chiefly respon-
sible for the increased revenues.    The recurrent budget surplus rose from
Le 7 million in 1972/73 to Le 22 million in 1973/74.     The development budget
approached Le 26 million and was nearly 90 percent higher than in the pre-
ceding year.
8.        All available indicators suggest that fiscal performance has
deteriorated in the current financial year ending in June 1975. The original
budget estimates showed a current surplus of about Le 14 million, but supple-
mentary appropriations for recurrent expenditures, far in excess of anti-
cipated improvements in revenue, will practically eliminate the surplus.
About one half of the new appropriations relate to the rice trade.      In addi-
tion, the Sierra Leone Electricity Corporation, a public utility, suffered
substantial losses and had to borrow from the Government, even to service
outstanding Bank loans. The corporation has since taken steps to improve



- 3 -
its management, has increased tariffs by 80 percent on the average and is
reviewing with the Bank an investment program to make it financially viable.
Moreover, the recently announced but long overdue revision of civil service
salaries will cost the Government approximately Le 5 million a year. The
target for development expenditures was originally set at Le 33.4 million.
In view of an anticipated resource shortage, the Government decided to freeze
Le 10 million of development expenditures until additional resources could be
mobilized.  As a result of these developments the overall budget deficit is
now expected to reach about Le 26 million, or 22 percent of total expendi-
tures.  The deficit will have to be financed with domestic and foreign
borrowings.
Balance of Payments
9.        Sierra Leone has traditionally maintained an open economy with the
rest of the world, with a minimum of governmental interference with trade and
payments.  Imports of goods and services represent about 30 percent of the
gross domestic product and external capital contributes about one fourth of
gross investments. During 1974 imports were about 46 percent higher than in
the previous year ($173 million in 1973, $253-million in 1974), oil and rice
between them accounting for one half of the incremental imports. The in-
crease in imports also reflects the excessive internal demand caused in
large part by the budgetary deficit.   Export earnings in the year increased
by only 15 percent and the terms of trade deteriorated by 12 percentage
points (index 95.9 and 83.8 respectively in 1973 and 1974, compared to 100
in 1967-1969). Sierra Leone is one of the countries most seriously affected
by the recent changes in oil and commodity prices and has been classified
as such by the United Nations.
Economic Management
10.       The Government moved to cover the budgetary deficit and external
payments imbalance in three ways:
(i)  It borrowed US$6.2 million (SDR 4.4 m) equivalent from the
Fund's oil facility and US$3.6 million from the Arab Fund;
it also received a grant of US$1 million from the United
Nations.
(ii)  In October 1974 it introduced foreign exchange surrender
obligations on individuals and companies for repatriation
of foreign financial assets to Sierra Leone (the measure
brought about US$20 million in the last quarter of 1974).
(iii)  It arranged to finance part of its capital expenditures by
suppliers' credits, at rather onerous terms.
11.       The Government realizes, however, that these measures will not
correct the underlying causes of the fiscal and balance of payments deficits,
and a comprehensive program of remedial actions is being put into effect
designed to check the rise in public expenditures, increase government



- 4 -
revenues and restrain the demand for imports.   A Foreign Exchange Budget
Advisory Committee has been established at ministerial level to coordinate
policy; a temporary moratorium (until June 1976) has been placed on incurring
new suppliers' credits, and all proposals for external borrowing will be rigor-
ously scrutinized with a view to easing the burden of debt service on the
balance of payments. The Government will depend increasingly on official
loans with long maturities to finance its development program, and assistance
is beinnz sought from the Bank Group for a number of projects on whichi prepara-
tion is well advanced.
12.       Taking a longer view, the Government aims at maintaining the country
more or less self-sufficient in rice, at meeting rising domestic consumption
of other foods and at diversifying its export earnings away from diamonds by
encouraging production of cocoa and coffee, as well as bauxite and rutile.
The proposed agricultural development project fits in well with this general
strategy.
13.       Sierra Leone faces a difficult task in adjusting; to thie situation
created by its depleting dianond resources, a task which has been complicated
by the rise in oil prices ancl a general deterioration in the country's terms
of trade.  There is justification in these circumstanices for external lenders
to finance a fairly high proportion of project expendituires, including somne
local costs, when the foreign exchange component is relatively low.
Elxternal Debt
14.       The external debt service ratio is estimiiated at .;.3 percent of
exports for 1974 and 10.6 percent in 1975.    Calculations made by Bank staff
and discussed with the Sierra Leone authorities suggest that, if full advan-
tage is taken of the official aid available, including access for the first
time to the l.uropean Development Fund, andZ if thie Governm,ent takes appropriate
action to restrain demand for imports, it should be possible to carry through
the essential core of t1he developmernt plan without increasing the cdebt service
ratio above 12 percenit by the end of the present Ieca(le.   [canwhile, do-iestic
and external debt charges are estimated to reach 23 percent of budget revenues
in FY, 1974/75 and around 27 percent in FY 1975/76, up from 18 percent in thie
oreceding years. liowever, this ratio will decline significantly in four or
five years when the recently contracted suppliers' credits are repaid. Accord-
ingly, Sierra Leone is creditworthy for the proposed loan.
15.       Sierra Leone's medium and long-term external (uebt outstanding and
disbursed at the end of 1974 totaled an estimated US$107.-5 million.  Of thiis
amount, the Bank's share was 6.0 percent (12.6 percent including IDA), reflect-
ing the small amount of Bank Group lending in the past.    Uith the proposed new
loans the Bank's share in debt outstanding iniglht increase to about 8 percent
by 1979), with the B3ank Group's share of service on this debt unlikely to ex-
ceed 6 percent.

PART II - BANK GR.OUP OPERATIONS IN SIERR LEONE
16.       Bank Group lending operations in Sierra Leone to date have totaled
US$24.5 million -- three loans amounting to $13.7 million, including a supple-
mentary loan of $2.3 million made in January 1975; and three credits totaling
$10.8 million. Three loans and one credit are fully disbursed. The loans
have been for expansion of power facilities and for a road construction and
highway maintenance project. The credits have gone for agriculture, education
and roads. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA
credits as of February 28, 1975, and notes on the execution of ongoing proj-
ects. The education project (credit 170-SL of 1970) and the first agriculture
project (credit 323-SL of 1972) are being implemented successfully. The highway
project (credit 218-SL of 1970 and loans 710-SL and 710-2-SL of 1970 and 1975)
had problems with initial contracting and cost overrun (President's Memoranda
Sec. M72-418, IDA/Sec M72-171 of August 11, 1972 and R75-9 of January 3,
1975 explained these issues). Work on the road is now proceeding satisfac-
torily and the project is expected to be completed within the next few months.
17.       The central objectives of Bank Group assistance to Sierra Leone
can be summarized as follows: To assist the Government in improving income
levels of the poorest sections of the population, especially in rural areas;
to continue assisting the transition from the former rail based transportation
system to a more economical road based network; to help improve performance
of the education system by relating its output to employment needs and by
encouraging wider educational opportunity; to reduce dependence on oil as
the source for energy by assisting in orderly development of a viable hydro-
electric project; and more generally to assist the Government in improving
its balance of payments. The agriculture project proposed here will benefit
smallholders, including some of the poorest farmers in the country, reduce
Sierra Leone's dependence on imported rice and increase export earnings from
cocoa and oil palm (see para. 36).
18.       It is proposed to concentrate future Bank Group assistance in four
key sectors: agriculture, education, power and roads. A second education
project was appraised in January/February and should be ready for considera-
tion by Executive Directors within the next few months. A power project,
appraised in March, would strengthen existing generating capacity in Freetown
and provide detailed engineering for a proposed hydroelectric project along
the Seli river. In addition to participating in financing of the hydroelectric
project, the Bank would assist Government in attracting other sources of exter-
nal finance for the undertaking. Detailed engineering studies are now under-
way for a proposed road project that would improve access on the main road
link between Freetown and upcountry communities. Appraisal of the second road
project is scheduled for FY1976.   Each of these projects, by providing assist-
ance in the main development sectors, would implement the lending objectives
outlined in paragraph 17.

PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
19.       The latest Bank analysis of Sierra Leone's agricultural sector
is contained in Volume III, Annexes 2, and 3, of the recent economic report
(No. 494a-SL). The IDA-assisted agriculture project approved in 1972 was
directed at improved output of smallholder rice farmers and tree crop produc-
tion in the Eastern Province. Generally the response has been encouraging,
and the experience has helped in the design of this proposed second project.
Sector Background
20.       Agriculture accounts for 75 percent of the nation's employment
and 16 percent of its exports, but has been growing only at an annual rate
of 1.6 percent. This has caused a decline in per capita rural income, leading
to a growing disparity in incomes (national average per capita income $160;
in rural areas only $55-$72) and heavy dependence on food imports. Tradi-
tional farming, which is still mostly outside the monetized economy, consists
of about 290,000 farmers cultivating more than 1.3 million acres. Smallholder
agriculture is based upon the classic bush fallow system, which comprises
some 70 percent of the total crop acreage. Average acreage under cultiva-
tion per holder is about 4.5 acres, with wide variations ranging from 7 acres
in the Eastern Province to only 1 acre in the Wqestern Area. Nearly two-
thirds of all farms have less than 5 acres.
21.       Rice, the basic staple food, is grown on more than 50 percent of
all land under cultivation and by 80 percent of all farmers. Sierra Leone
has one of the highest per capita consumption rates of rice in West Africa
(100 to 120 kilograms). Before the 1950s, the country was a net exporter
of rice. Since then it has had to import rice in significant quantities.
For instance, in the first decade of independence (1961-71) rice imports
totaled about 8 percent of the country's national consumption; in 1973
import requirements increased to about 17 percent of consumption. The main
causes for this trend were increased diamond mining activities, which sharply
stimulated rice demand, and a decline in domestic rice production because of
inadequate price incentives and labor migration into mining.    This situation
is changing now, and farmers are responding favorably to new price incentives
(see paras. 5 and 24).
22.       Sierra Leone's main export crops are palm kernels, cocoa, coffee
and ginger. These accounted for foreign exchange earnings of about USS30
million in 1973. The export crops are grown mainly in the eastern and
southern part of the country where rainfall and climate are particularly
suitable and where the rural economy is much more cash oriented than in the
north. The northern region has long dry seasons, supports a system of shift-
ing annual crop cultivation in which rice, groundnuts and sorghum are grown,
and has basically a subsistence economy.   The differences in these two
agricultural zones has resulted in uneven development which, in turn, has
tended to aggravate the country's political and social tensions.



- 7 -
23.       The oDjectives of government agricultural policy are to achieve
self-sufficiency in rice, to increase production of tihe main export crops
and to stimulate more balanced regional development. The primary responsibi-
lity for government support in agricultural development, research and exten-
sion services lies with the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources.
Its impact has been lim,ited, largely because of staff and financial resource
constraints.
24.       However, the Government is gradually coming to grips with these
deficiencies. It has sought and received assistance from the United Kingdom
to help strengthen planning and project preparation capacities. The
Ministry of Agriculture is currently reviewing its own organization, train-
ing and research functions, in order to equip it better to carry out govern-
ment objectives. New incentives for rice and export crop production are
now being provided through higher government guaranteed prices for these
key crops and the evidence so far is that farmers are responding favorably.
The IDA- assisted agriculture development project in the Eastern Province
has, on balance, been successful in providing essential support services
that have helped stimulate greater smnallholder production of rice and tree
crops. It has established patterns that can be repeated in other parts of
Sierra Leone. The proposed second project expands on tnis experience.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.       In May 1974 the Government officially requested Bank Group assist-
ance for a second agriculture project that would extend development of the
existing IDA-financed project in the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone, begin
a new development project in the Northern Province and provide special assist-
ance to the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources. The project was
prepared by the Government with assistance from the Bank's Resident Mission
for West Africa and consultants financed under the first project. The proj-
ect was appraised by a Bank mission in June, 1974. A report entitled
"Appraisal of Integrated Agricultural Development Project II", No. 644-SL
dated April 8, 1975, is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
Negotiations took place in Washington from March 19, 1975, to March 21, 1975.
The Borrower was represented by a team headed by Mr. George Mason, permanent
Secretary, Mfinistry of Agriculture and Natural Resources.
Project Content
26.       The project has two main objectives:    first, to help increase
agricultural production and farm incomes; second, to establish permanent
farner support services that will help overall agricultural development
and contribute to an improved quality of life in rural areas.



- 8 -
27.       The project lhas three distinct cornponents:   (a) initiation of a
new agricultural development effort in Sierra Leone's Northern Province,
based in Mlakeni; (see map) (b) expansion of the existing IDA-financed project
at Kenema, in the Eastern Province; and (c) special institutional and technical
assistance for the Ministry of Agriculture in Freetown. For the Northern
Area, the project would construct 20 miles and improve 280 miles of crop
extraction roads; 200 village wells, 5 market centers, a farmer training
center, staff houses, stores and offices. It would provide extension and
other farmer services, including seed multiplication farm, vehicles and
equipment, and improved production, through short and medium-term loans, of
6,000 acres of inland swamp rice, 25,000 acres of upland rice and 10,000
acres of groundnuts. It would investigate the potential of livestock
development in the Northern Province, and would research methods of increas-
ing wood fuel for future expansion of tobacco production. For the Eastern
Province, the project would construct 12 market centers, additional staff
houses, stores, and offices. In conjunction with improved farmer services
it would provide short, medium and long-term credit to increase the production
of 1,800 acres of inland swamp rice and 36,000 acres of upland rice; would
develop 4,200 acres of inland swamp for rice production; and establish 1,000
acres of cocoa and 1,600 acres of smallliolder oil palm. It would establish
a Farmer Finance Company to assume the existing activities of the revolving
credit fund. For the Eastern area and Northern area projects, production
increases would be brought about by using improved seeds, fertilizers and
pesticides. The project would also provide support to central government
institutions, including establishing and staffing a Project Evaluation and
Services Unit (PESU) in the Ministry of Agriculture and :Iatural Resources
(MkANR) to provide operational support and financial control for the north and
east and would strengthen planning and evaluation by hiring specialist con-
sultants.
Project Cost
28.        The proposed loan/credit of US$10.0 million (Loan of US$5.0 million;
Development Credit of US$5.0 million) would represent 73 percent of total
project costs, net of taxes, estimated at US$13.7 million. The following
table summarizes the project cost, its financing and distribution over the
three components:

all identifiable taxes.
The proposed Bank Group contribution would cover all the foreign exchange
costs estimated at $6.0 million and 52 percent of local costs, or $4.0 mil-
lion.
Project xecution
29.       Both the Northern Area and Eastern Area projects would be managed
by separate project management units responsible to the Ministry of Agricul-
ture. Such a unit already exists in the east and it would continue its
responsibility. Each project unit would have a project manager and five
distinct departments responsible for:  administration and personnel; finance;
extension and training, conservation and land development and commercial
services. A new project evaluation and services unit (PESU) would be esta-
blished in the Ministry in Freetown, reporting directly to the Permanent
Secretary. It would oversee and assist the project management units in the
east and north in order to ensure: effective financial control; maintenance
of adequate accounts; proper execution of credit and farm input systems; coor-
dination with other externally financed development projects. In addition,
the project management units in the north and east would be assisted by
special project coordinating committees comprised of government and tribal



- 10 -
leaders from the respective areas.   The main purpose of these committees will
be to involve local leaders with development efforts in respective areas.
This step is necessary in order to help continue the tempo of the rural deve-
lopment program in the post-project period. A project development committee
established under the first agriculture project would continue to assist in
overall coordination at the national level.
Agriculture Credit
30.       Prior to commencement of the proposed Eastern Area extension,
Government will establish a Farmer Finance Company to take over functions
of the revolving credit fund, which was set up as part of the first project.
The purpose of the company, based at Kenema, would be to provide continuity
for the credit fund and its subsequent expansion, to associate commercial
banks with agricultural lending, and to attract farmer equity participation.
The National Development Bank and commercial banks have expressed interest
in equity participation, directorships, provision of seasonal finance and the
secondment of a finance manager. During negotiations, assurances were given
by Government that such a company would be established before December 31,
1975. (Section 3.06 of Development Credit Agreement). In the Northern Area
project, a new revolving credit fund will be established, as in the first
phase of the Eastern project. Currently, development loans in the Eastern
Area project carry an 8 percent interest rate and seasonal loans a fixed
charge of 10 percent. To avoid discrepancies between existing and new borrow-
ers these rates would be maintained. The fixed charge of 10 percent on sea-
sonal loans corresponds to an interest rate between 15 to 20 percent per annum.
Training
31.       To implement extension and farmer support services in both projects,
a total of 104 staff in various categories would be required in the north
and 136 in the east. While most positions in the two projects would be
filled by nationals, it may be that some teclhnical positions will have to
be filled witlh expatriates through international recruitment since the
countrv is critically short of experienced high-level technicians.    The great
majority of project staff would be obtained through transfers within the
Mlinistry of Agriculture and from other government departments, from the com-
mercial sector or through special training courses established within the
two projects. Both project management units would train junior staff at
project training centers. The new farmer training center in the north would
have a 40-bed dormitory. It would be used for staff and farmer training on
the same basis as the successful training scheme currently underway as part
of the first project in the east. Financing for consultant services would be
provided to assist the Ministry of Agriculture in project planning, evalua-
tion and other specialist activities.
Procurement and Disbursements
32.       Procurement of vehicles, plant, equipment, fertilizers, pesticides
and tools for contracts with a value of more than US$24,000 would be through
international competitive bidding (ICB) and would have an estimated value of



- 11 -
US$1.7 million.  An aggregate limit of $200,000 would be applicable for items
(equipment, tools) to be purchased through local competitive bidding of less
than $24,000 each. Contracts for the construction of buildings and houses
and the purchase of construction materials and furnishings valued at US$1.3
million would not be attractive to foreign suppliers due to their dispersed
location and the small size of individual contracts. For these items, con-
tracts would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally,
under procedures satisfactory to the Bank Group, and foreign firms and suppliers
would be eligible to bid. Road construction and improvement would be undertaken
on force account due to the shortage of suitable contractors. Wells would be
constructed by villagers using project supplied materials. Domestically manu-
factured goods would be allowed a preference of 15 percent or applicable customs
duty, whichever is lower, when comparing domestic bids with those of foreign
manufacturers. (Sections A.2 and C of Schedule 3 to the Credit Agreement.)
33.       Proceeds of the loan/credit would be disbursed over five years
and the credit would be disbursed first (details in Annex III). Retroactive
financing of up to $100,000 is recommended to permit employment of a financial
controller for the project services unit in Freetown and the project manager
and accountant for the Northern Area project.
Conditions and Assurances
34.       The Government has given assurances pertaining to such matters as
establishment of the Daru Oil Palm Company, national research policy, audited
annual accounts for the project management units, construction of crop extrac-
tion roads in the Eastern Province, policies on fertilizer and agricultural
subsidies. On the fertilizer issue the Government has agreed to reduce by
30 percent the fertilizer subsidy to project farmers and to consult with the
Association by March 31, 1976 on proposals for reducing or removing agricul-
tural subsidies in relation to product pricing policies. (Sections 3.02, 3.04,
3.05, 3.07, 3.08, 4.01-4.04 of the Credit Agreement.)
35.       In the previous Development Credit Agreement (Integrated Agriculture
Development Project, 323-SL of June 1972) provision was made (Section 3.05)
for establishment of an Agricultural Development Authority (ADA). Subse-
quently, the Government proposed, and the Association agreed, that creation
of the new institution was not required since the Ministry of Agriculture had
in the interim taken adequate steps to provide the planning and other organi-
zational functions that had originally been envisioned as a main part of the
ADA's proposed scope of activity (para 24). An appropriate amendment to the
earlier Development Credit Agreement has been incorporated into the draft
Development Credit Agreement for this project. (Article V, Credit Agreement.)
Benefits
36.       The internal economic rate of return is estimated at 26 percent
for the project as a whole. About 14,000 farmers would directly benefit from
project activities. An additional 65,000 farmers in the north and east would
indirectly benefit from better water supplies, improved trading and social



- 12 -
services due to better communications, the strengthening of government insti-
tutions and services. The annual incremental production at full development,
inclusive of the initial phase of the Eastern Area project, would be 1rJ,500
tons of white rice, 3,200 tons of palm oil, 750 tons of palm kernels, 550
tons of cocoa and 1,100 tons of groundnuts. The net per capita income of
directly affected persons would rise in the east from $60 to $100 and in the
north from $30 to $40. The project will help reduce the absolute level of
poverty in the north, and bring the income levels in the east closer to the
national average. At full development, government direct revenues would
reach an estimated total of about Le 180,000 ($216,000) per annum through
export taxes on cocoa and palm kernels. Indirect taxation, mainly through
taxes levied on consumer goods (estimated at 12 percent of farm incomes),
could provide an additional Le 200,000 ($240,000) per annum. The value of
incremental output from the project (at international prices) is estimated
at $4.9 million annually at full development, which denotes the relief to the
balance of payments through additional exports and savings on imports.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTIIORITY
37.       The draft Loan Agreement between Sierra Leone and the Bank, the
draft Development Credit Agreement between Sierra Leone and the Association,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of
the Articles of Agreement, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for
in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association,
and the texts of the resolutions approving the proposed loan and credit are
being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
38.       Additional conditions of loan/credit effectiveness include:     (a) that
special bank accounts with initial payments of Le 20,000 and Le 100,000 be
established respectively for the project evaluation and services unit in the
Ministry of Agriculture and for the Northern Area project along with government
guaranteed draw down procedures; (b) that the Government establish the Northern
Area project management unit and reorganize the Eastern project management unit
with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank; (c) that the project manager
and accountant of the Northern Area project as well as the financial controller
for the project evaluation and services unit be appointed on terms and condi-
tions satisfactory to the Bank. (Sections 6.01 (b), (c) and (d) of Credit
Agreement). The Government has already initiated action for fulfilling these
conditions.
39.       I am satisfied that the proposed Loan and the proposed Development
Credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the
Association.

B.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit No. 218-SI,             First Highway Project:   US$3.5 million
Credit of October 29, 1970; US$3.7
Loan No. 710-SL                million Loan of October 29, 1970; both
fully disbursed; US$2.3 million supple-
Supplementary Loan 710-2-SL    mentary Loan of January 20, 1975:
Closing date,   June 30, 1976.
This project includes construction of the Bo-Kenema road, purchases
of road maintenance equipment, a feasibility study and detailed engineering
for a future highway project as well as technical assistance to the Ministry
of Works for improving organization and road maintenance. The last two compo-
nents are being financed by the UNDP with the Bank as executing agency. The
tender for construction of the Bo-Kenema road attracted limited interest from
contractors and the lowest bid was more than 60 percent above the consultant's
original estimate and 40 percent above the Bank appraisal estimate. The Gov-
ernment subsequently decided to award a management-type contract to a German
firm which had submitted a target cost proposal with a bonus/penalty clause
and with equipment to be supplied by the contractor. In order to accommodate
the additional cost, the Executive Directors in August, 1972 approved the
proposal for reallocation of the full amount of contingencies under the loan/
credit account to construction.
Because of quantity and price increases since 1972, as well as
currency realignments, only 60 percent of the project had been completed by
December, 1974 when the original credit and loan were fully disbursed. The
Government, whose finances have been adversely affected by a sharply increased
oil import bill and higher outlays for rice imports, requested a supplementary
loan of US$2.3 million from Bank to complete the project. This represented
about 65 percent of the total cost overrun of US$3.6 million and the Govern-
ment agreed to provide the remaining US$1.3 million. The Executive Directors
approved the supplementary financing on January 13, 1975. Because of a
parallel increase in benefits, the estimated economic return on the road
construction is not significantly changed from the 21 percent originally cal-
culated. Work on the road is now proceeding and is expected to be completed
in late spring, 1975.
Loan No. 388-SL              Power projects; US$3.8 million Loan of August 18,
1964; US$3.9 million Loan of August 5, 1968;
Loan No. 553-SL              both fully disbursed.
These loans assisted mainly in strengthening and expanding power
generation and distribution systems in and around Freetown. The Sierra Leone
Electricity Corporation, which is the Borrower under the project, encountered
a series of managerial, labor and financial difficulties as early at 1971.
The situation worsened in 1974 when the general manager and two other top
officers of the Corporation were charged with fraud and fired. Government
subsequently contracted with a European consulting firm to run the Corporation
and to restore managerial and financial stability. There are signs of growing

improvement: strict discipline is being enforced within the company; greater
efforts are being made to reduce arrears; two tariff increases have been
approved. The petroleum crisis has had serious adverse effects on the Corpo-
ration and the country (the oil import bill has increased from about US$8.0
million in 1973 to about US$24 million in 1974). The Government, anxious to
reduce its dependence on petroleum-based power, has asked the Bank's assist-
ance in exploiting the country's hydro potential. A strategy for possible
help in this area is now being formulated.
Credit No. 170-SL         Education project; US$3.0 million Credit of January 5,
1970; Closing date: December 31, 1975.
This project was directed largely toward improving and diversifying
education at the secondary level. It included extensions to existing facili-
ties at secondary and trade schools, a technical institute and a primary
teacher college as well as special services to assist in revising and
modernizing secondary curricula. Implementation has been successful, both in
educational and physical terms. The closing date of June 30, 192 has been
postponed until December 31, 1975.
Credit No. 323-SL         Agriculture Project:  US$4.3 million Credit of
September 30, 1972; Closing date: March 31,
1976.
This credit is helping to finance a smallholder development effort
in eastern Sierra Leone involving 6,000 acres of swamp rice; 750 acres of
cocoa, 2,600 acres of oil palm estate, construction of palm oil mill and small
rice mills. Some institutional problems had been encountered, involving the
status and relationship of the project management unit with the Ministry of
Agriculture and the government extension service. These difficulties have
been resolved, and the project is currently operating satisfactorily. An
extension of the project is proposed as a part of the second agriculture
project.

Procurement
Arrangements    Procurement of vehicles, plant, equipment, fertilizers,
pesticides and tools under contracts with a value of
more than Le 20,000 ($24,000) would be through inter-
national competitive bidding (ICB). A maximum limit
totaling $200,000 would be set for those items purchased
through contracts of less than $24,000. Domestically
manufactured goods would be allowed a preference of 15
percent, or applicable customs duty, whichever is lower,
when comparing domestic bids with those of foreign
manufacturers. Contracts for construction, materials
and furnishings valued at Le 1.1 million (US$1.3 million)
would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding
advertised locally and in accordance with procedures
satisfactory to the Bank; foreign firms will be eligible
to participate but it may not be attractive to them due
to the dispersed location of the work and the small size
of individual contracts. Road construction would be
carried out on force account because of the shortage of
suitable contractors.
Technical
Assistance:     About 20 man months of consultants' services would be
financed under the loan/hredit tc assist the Ministry
of Agriculture in project planning, evaluation and other
specialist areas, and 28 man years of management and
technical specialists to assist in project implementation.
Rate of
Return:         The estimated economic rate of return is 26 percent.

Report:         Report No. 644-SL of April 8, 1975.
