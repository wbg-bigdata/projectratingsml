SIERRA LEONE
APPRAISAL OF
INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
(i)       The Republic of Sierra Leone (SLG) has requested Bank assistance
to finance an agricultural development project in the Northern Province of
Sierra Leone and to extend the development of the ongoing integrated Agri-
cultural Development Project in the Eastern Province financed under IDA
Credit 323SL of June 30, 1972. The project was prepared by the Sierra Leone
Government with the assistance of- the Resident Mission for Western Africa
and consultants financed under the first credit. This report is based on
the findings of an appraisal mission that visited Sierra Leone in June 1974.
(ii)      Under the present economic circumstances of the declining, formerly
dominant, diamond mining industry it is becoming increasingly important for
Sierra Leone to expand its export crops, to reduce food imports, and to in-
crease rural incomes. Farmers in the north have a per capita income of only
US$30 per annum, compared with US$60 in the east, and the average per capita
income for the country is about US$160. The difference between the East and
the North reflects mainly better soils and climatic conditions, lower popula-
tion density and the predominance of export earning tree crops in the East.
(iii)     To correct this imbalance, Government is placing greater emphasis'
on development in the north even though economic returns are substantially
lower than in the southern and eastern areas. The ongoing Integrated Agri-
cultural Development Project in the east has prover thnat under good manage-
ment and with adequate services and inputs farmers respond well. The success
of the project has encouraged Government to look for similar developments
elsewhere; at the same time SLG appreciates the need for continued develop-
ment in the higher potential eastern and southern areas.
(iv)      The project covers two separate areas referred to as the Eastern
Area Project (EAP), which is identical to the ongoing Integrated Agricul-
tural Development Project area, and the Northern Area Project (NAP). EAP
comprises 4,300 sq. miles, 65,000 farm families and is divided into 32
chiefdom administrative divisions. Some 6,000 EAP farmers would be directly
affected by the project. NAP comprises 1,300 sq. miles, 14,000 farm families
and 8 chiefdoms; 8,000 NAP farmers would be affected by the project. In each
area farm sizes are small, less than 6 acres, and NAP has limited areas of
inland swamp (6,000 acres utilizable), compared to unlimited swamp areas in
EAP (estimated at more than 60,000 acres).
(v)       The project would provide physical infrastructure, support services
and farm inputs to ensure for the future a sound agricultural and development
base. For NAP it would construct 20 miles and improve 280 miles of crop
extraction roads, 200 village wells, 5 market centers, a farmer training



- ii -
center, staff houses, stores and offices; it would provide extension and
other farmer services, including a project established seed multiplication
farm, vehicles and equipment, and improved production, through short- and
medium-term loans, of 6,000 acres of inland swamp rice, 25,000 acres of upland
rice and 10,000 acres of groundnuts; it would investigate the potential of
livestock development in the Northern Province; and would research into methods
of increasing wood fuel for future expansion of tobacco production. For EAP
the project would construct 12 market centers, additional staff houses,
stores, and offices; in conjunction with improved farmer services it would
provide short-, medium- and long-term credit to increase the production of
1,800 acres of inland swamp rice and 36,000 acres of upland rice; would
develop 4,200 acres of inland swamp for rice production; and establish 1,000
acres of cocoa and 1,600 acres of small holder oil palm; it would establish
a farmer finance company to assume the existing activities of the revolving
credit fund. For EAP and NAP production increases would be brought about by
using improved seeds, fertilizers and pesticides.
(vi)      The project would provide support to central Government institu-
tions, including establishing and staffing a Project Evaluation and Services
Unit (PESU) in the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR) to
provide operational and financial support for NAP and EAP; and would stren-
gthen MANR's planning capacity by hiring specialist consultants.
(vii)     The existing EAP management unit (EAPMU) would be expanded, and
a new project management unit (NAPMU) would be established for NAP. Both
units would be responsible to the Permanent Secretary of MANR.
(viii)    The proposed IDA credit of US$5 million and a Bank loan of US$5.0
million, repayable at 8-1/2% over 25 years including a five year grace period
for principal, during which interest and commitment charges would be paid,
would be made to the Republic of Sierra Leone. The loan/credit of US$10.0
million would be 73% of total project costs, estimated at US$13.7 million,
and would cover all the foreign exchange costs estimated at US$6.0 million
and 52% of local costs estimated at US$4.0 million. Of the US$10.0 million,
US$1.0 million would be for support services to centralized Government in-
stitutions; US$2.3 million for EAP, US$4.3 million for NAP; and the remainder
US$2.4 million would be for contingencies. SLG would finance 26% of the
project costs amounting to US$2.9 million and the remaining 1%, US$0.2 million,
would be contributed by participating farmers in the form of cash payments for
seasonal inputs.
(ix)      Procurement of vehicles, plant, equipment, fertilizers, pesticides
and tools for contracts with a value of more than Le 20,000 (US$24,000) would
be through international competitive bidding (ICB), and would have an estimated
value of US$1.7 million. A maximum limit of US$200,000 would be set for those
items purchased through contracts of less than US$24,000. Contracts for the
construction of buildings, houses, and the purchase of construction materials
and furnishings valued at US$1.3 million would not be suitable for ICB, due to
their dispersed location and small size of individual contracts and orders;



- iii -
for these items contracts would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding
advertised locally and in accordance with local procedures satisfactory to the
Bank; in the latter case, foreign firms and suppliers would not be precluded
from bidding. Road construction and improvement would be undertaken on force
account due to the shortage of suitable contractors. Wells would be con-
structed by villagers using project supplied materials. The estimated cost
for road and water development is US$1.3 million. A large part of project
costs, US$7.6 million, would be for labor, staff salaries and allowances,
hiring of consultants, vehicle and maintenance operations, farm planting
materials and general services, and would be unsuitable for competitive bid-
ding. The remaining US$3.1 million would be for physical and price contin-
gencies. Internationally recruited staff and consultants would be employed
under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.
(x)       Proceeds of the Bank Loan and IDA Credit would be disbursed to cover:
(a) 100% of the CIF cost of directly imported vehicles, heavy plant and equip-
ment or 87% of the costs if procured locally - US$0.9 million; (b) 100% of the
CIF cost of directly imported fertilizers - US$0.5 million; (c) 100% of the
costs of internationally recruited staff and consultants - US$1.3 million;
(d) 70% of the total cost of buildings, houses, furnishings, construction
materials for roads and wells, local staff, support services, and vehicle and
plant operation - US$3.8 million; (e) 70% of farm inputs other than fertili-
zers, including pesticides, fungicides, herbicides, tools, hired labor, spray-
ing machines - US$1.0 million; and (f) an unallocated amount totalling US$2.4
million. Disbursements would be made against import documentation, contracts
and certified records of expenditure.
(xi)      14,000 farmers would directly beneAit from the project.  The annual
incremental production at full development, inclusive of the initial phase of
EAP would be 10,500 tons of white rice, 3,200 tons of palm oil, 550 tons of
cocoa and 1,100 tons of groundnuts. The project would indirectly benefit a
further 65,000 farmers through provision of better communications, water
supplies and markets. Intangible benefits include the improved health of the
population through better water supplies, improved trading and social services
due to better communications, the strengthening of Government institutions,
improved evaluation and planning of existing and future projects, and the
commercial reorientation of credit and farm supplies. The internal economic
rate of return is estimated for NAP at 14%, for EAP 36% and for the overall
project 26%. The net per capita income of directly affected persons would rise
in EAP from US$60 to US$100 and for NAP from US$30 to US$40. The per capita
incomes of participants increase by about 6% and 11% per annum for NAP and EAP
respectively over the full development period.
(xii)     On the basis of the assurances and conditions set out in Chapter IX,
the project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$5 million and a Bank loan of
US$5.0 million.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises an application made to the Bank Group by the
Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone (SLG) to assist in financing a
new project in the Northern Province and an extension of an ongoing project
in the Eastern and Southern Provinces of Sierra Leone that is financed under
Credit 323-SL. The projects would benefit farm families whose incomes are
about US$30 per capita in the North and US$60 in the East. A total of some
14,000 farm families would directly participate and some 65,000 additional
farm families would receive indirect benefits from the projects.
1.02      The feasibility study for the Northern Area Project (NAP) was
financed partly under Credit 323-SL and was prepared by SLG with the assistance
of United Kingdom technical assistance, consultants, and the Bank's Regional
Mission to Western Africa (RMWA). Plans for the extension of the Eastern Area
Project (EAP) were prepared by SLG on the basis of the results of the ongoing
project and after discussion with various Bank supervision missions.
1.03      The ongoing Eastern Area Project, now more than half completed, has
had good farmer response. The Credit was signed in June 1972, and became
effective six months later. The project's primary objective was to provide
farm services, credit and input supplies to about 3,000 farmers to help them
develop swamp rice, cocoa and oil palm. It also provided for the construction
of a modern palm oil mill; and for the execution of rice milling and marketing,
forestry and northern agricultural project studies. Although slow starting
the project Is Inow oil schedule and in some instances has more than achieved
its targets. 3,300 acres of swamp rice have been developed (110% of appraisal
estimate), 475 acres of cocoa (190%), 508 acres of plantation oil palm (100%)
and 955 acres of smallholder oil palm (96%). All the studies except for the
forestry study have been completed, and the palm oil mill is under construction.
The IDA credit has been committed and it is expected that the project will be
substantially completed in October 1975, six months ahead of appraisal esti-
mate, and that 6,000 acres of swamp rice, 750 acres of cocoa, and 2,260 acres
of oil palm will have been successfully established.
1.04      The ongoing EAP has provided a means of testing farmers' responses
to new techniques; however, it was necessary because of the weaknesses of
Government's agricultural services to set up EAP as a semi-enclave operation.
Under the proposed extension EAP project management unit would become more
closely associated with the Eastern Provinces regular agricultural services,
in that the latter would fall under the administration of EAP. Thus it is
expected that by 1978 when the extension to EMP would be complete a fully
integrated agricultural service would be functioning to provide the majority
of Eastern Province farmers with an adequate service.
1.05      The Northern Area Project (NAP) would concentrate on stimulating the
production of rice and groundnuts. NAP management would have the same high
level of autonomy afforded to EAP and administrative and technical procedures



would be those that have been proven in the Eastern Province. At a later
stage of NAP development it would be integrated with the regular agricultural
services provided by the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR).
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      The Republic of Sierra Leone covers about 28,000 square miles and
has a population of about 2.8 million. GNP in 1973 was estimated at Le373
million (US$448 million) equivalent to Le133 (US$160) per capita. The economy
comprises two main sectors: a well developed, export-orientated mining sector,
dominated by the diamond industry, which employs 4% of the economically active
population and produces 16% of GNP and about 80% of total exports; and a poorly
developed agricultural sector that provides livelihoods for 75% of the popula-
tion, 32% of GNP and about 20% of total exports.
B. Agricultural Sector
2.02      Sierra Leone has two distinct ecological zones.  The northern half
of the country has long dry seasons, and supports a system of shifting annual
crop cultivation in which rice, groundnuts and sorghum are the principal crops.
The southern half has a rainfall and climate suitable for the profitable cul-
tivation of three crops especially cocoa, coffee, and oil palm which are Sierra
Leone's main export crops, as well as for rice and other annual crops. The
south has the best agricultural potential, and because most mining and indus-
trial activities are located in the south, it has a rural economy that is much
more cash orientated than that of the north which is basically a subsistance
economy.
2.03      Rice is the staple food of Sierra Leone, and until the early 1950s
the country was self-sufficient in this commodity. During the last 20 years,
however, an average of some 30,000 tons of white rice have been imported
annually, and in 1973/74 rice imports totalled 42,000 tons at a cost of some
US$17 million. These imports reflect an average per capita consumption of
250 lb, the highest in West Africa, and the inability, so far, of Government
to effectively stimulate domestic production.
2.04      Export crops accounted in 1973 for foreign exchange earnings of
about US$30 million, and comprised 32,000 tons of palm kernels, 6,000 tons of
cocoa beans, 12,000 tons of coffee beans, and 400 tons of ginger. Of all
agricultural exports only about 16% was produced in the northern zone.
2.05      Government's major aspirations for the agricultural sector include:
(a) self-sufficiency in rice; (b) increasing production of the main export
crops and thus foreign exchange earnings and export tax revenues; and



(c) correcting regional income imbalances, particularly between the north
and south. Incentives for rice and export crop production are now being
provided through higher Government guaranteed prices for these key crops and
the evidence is that farmers are responding. Longer term production objec-
tives should be achieved through development projects providing effective
extension, credit and input supply services to farmers. The objective of
correcting regional imbalances will be more difficult to achieve primarily
because the natural resources of southern Sierra Leone are superior to those
of the north. Per capita incomes in the north are only half of that estimated
for the south, and there is a real need to attempt to correct this imbalance,
though seemingly a very difficult task. Government's main assistance to
northern farmers to date has been through subsidized tractor hire services
and fertilizers. Much of these have been employed in uneconomic activities
and only a small number of farmers, usually the more wealthy, have benefited.
The proposed northern project is designed to help improve farm incomes in the
north but as shown later in this report investments in agriculture in the
north cannot generate such high return as in the south.
C. Institutions
2.06      Government agencies and institutions that would be concerned with the
projects are described in Annex 1. The most important are the Ministry of
Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR), the Sierra Leone Produce Marketing
Board (SLPMB), the Rice Corporation, and the National Development Bank (NDB).
2.07      The Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR) is currently
reviewing its own organization and needs, especially planning, training and
research, in order to better equip it to carry out Government's objectives.
The improvement in agricultural research is critical if these objectives are
to be achieved. It is important that a research policy is drawn up that would
ensure: (a) support to existing and planned agricultural development programs,
(b) coordination of the programs undertaken by the individual research in-
stitutions in Sierra Leone, (c) rationalization of the terms and conditions
of employment for research workers, and (d) adequate financial planning for the
research program. During negotiations assurances were obtained from Govern-
ment that by March 31, 1976, it would prepare, for review with the Bank, pro-
posals for a research policy for Sierra Leone.
2.08      The Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board (SL1MB), established in 1949
is responsible for marketing the country's main export crops and fixing, in
conjunction with Government, cocoa, coffee and palm kernel producer prices.
SLPMB is required to maintain a price stabilization fund; and since 1967 has
contributed Le500,000 annually from its operating surpluses to the Government
budget. SLPMB operates through Licensed Buying Agents (LBA), who are respon-
sible for purchasing, grading, storing and evacuating produce to the port of
shipment; and through the Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Company (SLPMC), a
London subsidiary, for overseas sales. Currently SLPMB is run very conserva-
tively, and reserves now stand at Le2.5 million. Unfortunately this con-
servatism hrs generally meant that producer prices have been too low to
-it->ulate production.



2.09      The Rice Corporation, established in 1965, imports milled rice and
buys, mills, and markets domestically produced husk rice. Minimum producer
prices, recently raised from Le3.20 to Le5.00 per bushel for husk rice, are
maintained through a floor price system. Very little husk rice has been
purchased by the Corporation in recent years because its floor price has
been lower than market value. This has resulted in inadequate supplies
for its three rice mills which have operated at a loss. The Corporation has
become more active and in addition to a guaranteed floor price it intends to
employ mobile buying teams. These would initially function in EAP and NAP
areas. Full details on marketing are at Annex 2.
2.10      National Development Bank (NDB) provides development credit for
industrial and agricultural purposes. NDB is closely linked to the Bank of
Sierra Leone and to the commercial banks. NDB makes medium- to long-term
loans and restricts its lending to -loans of between US$9,000 to US$75,000.
Thus small farmers are excluded from its program. The cooperative movement
is in disarray, and except for credit provided by EAP to project farmers,
Government has so far been unable to provide any effective farm credit
system. NDB is interested in the possibility of being involved in small-
holder credit, although realizing the problems involved. Under the project
a Farmer Finance Company would be established in EAP in which NDB would
participate through equity (para. 6.21).
III. THE PROJECT AREA
3.01      General.  The Northern Area Project (NAP) centered on Makeni in the
Northern Province covers 1,300 square miles and affects 14,000 farming families
(172,000 people) in all. The Eastern Area Project (EAP) centered on Kenema
covers 4,300 square miles and supports 65,000 farm families (400,000 people),
of which initially 60,000 will be affected. Together the two project areas
comprise 20% of the total land area of Sierra Leone and accomodate 20% of its
population.
3.02      Northern Project Area (see Supplementary Volume 2) has a rainfall
over 100 inches falling in a 6 month wet season. There are two major soil
groups: the Rokel River series, of which the so called bolilands are part 1/;
and the granite and acid gneisses from which the inland swamps and upland
soils are derived. Up until now assured ways of developing the bolilands
economically have not been evolved, consequently the project would be confined
largely to the non boliland soils which now support 90% of the population.
Except for isolated inselburgs, the NAP area is moderately to gently rolling.
3.03      NAP is divided into eight chiefdoms each administered by a Paramount
Chief and chiefdom councillors who exert considerable influence and authority.
1/  These are low lying areas that cover 40% of the project area.  The boli-
lands have an inherent infertility and are subject to flooding during the
rains.



-5-
The main tribal groups in order of importance are the Temne, the Foulah, the
Lunba and the Loko. The Foulah are the major cattle holding community in the
country.
3.04      Communications are based on a north/south all weather spine road
which is adequate, and numerous small but poorly maintained earth surfaced
feeder roads and tracks. Most of the roads and tracks are impassable during
the wet season.
3.05      Health and education facilities in the project area are at least
average for Sierra Leone. The project area contains twelve dispensaries,
six health centers and four hospitals. Similarly education facilities are
adequate. Neither health nor education standards are considered a likely
constraint to achieving project objectives. Village water supplies are in-
adequate, and improvement of these supplies under the project are likely to
have a significant impact on the health of the villagers.
3.06      The farming system for upland soils is one of shifting cultivation,
in which 1 - 2 years cropping are followed by 5 - 10 years of bush fallow;
upland rice and groundnuts are the main crops. Most of the inland valley
swamps (8,000 acres) are used for rice and for other crops such as cassava
leaf and groundnuts grown mainly for home consumption. The fertility of both
upland soils and swamps is declining in the face of population increases,
and the lack of any practical alternative to shifting cultivation. It is
estimated that 24% of the population cultivates swamps only, 55% uplands and
swamps, and 21% uplands only. The average farmer cultivates between 5 - 6
acres annually of which 1 acre is swampland.
3.07      Land is owned by the community as a whole and ultimate responsibility
for primary allocation is that of the paramount chief. Once land has been
allocated, the usufruct is both retainable and inheritable for as long as it
is claimed. Actual occupants of the land comprise those with land title and
those who have acquired land from title holders. The latter type of acquisi-
tion is generally short-term for uplands and long-term for swampland and is
unheritable. Land so acquired is referred to locally as "begged-land", but
the actual transaction is accompanied by cash or gifts in kind. As the value
of swampland will increase under the project, a tendency could develop for
title holders to press for recovery of "begged-land". As this would be to
the disadvantage of the present occupants, project management would pay partic-
ular attention to this issue and would make every effort to agree on arrange-
ments with the traditional authorities to ensure that swamp developers have
satisfactory security of tenure to ensure their participation. Fortunately it
is estimated that only 15% of the swamps are occupied as "begged-land", and
consequently even should problems develop the success of the project would not
be jeopardized.
3.08      Crop yields are very low.  Swamps yield about 1,200 lb husk rice/acre,
and the uplands, under shifting cultivation and mixed cropping, about 500 lb
husk rice/acre, mixed with beans, sorghum, maize and beniseed. Groundnut
yields are about 900 lb unshelled nuts/acre.

3.09      There are about 15,000 head of cattle in the area, mostly owned by
semi-nomadic Foulah tribesmen. The cattle are of the trypanosomiasis tolerant
Ndama breed. Under current management conditions their productivity is low and
genetic potential limited. With increasing population, competition for land
between farmers and cattle owners has become more intense and there is a need
to stabilize the situation. One possible means, which would be tested under
the project, would be settlement of Foulah families on small scale ranches.
3.10      Eastern Project Area (see Supplementary Volume 3) is topographically
more broken with clearly defined valleys. Rainfall is generally higher and
more reliable than in the NAP area, and as the area has better upland and
swamp soils, the agricultural potential is markedly better than in the north.
3.11      EAP is divided into 32 chiefdoms with similar traditional disciplines
to those in the north. Most of the 18 ethnic groups of Sierra Leone are re-
presented of which the Mende are dominant. The average family size of about
6 is half that of the typical northern farm family.
3.12      Road communications need improvement in extent of network and con-
dition, and the inadequacy of crop extraction roads is a major production and
marketing constraint.
3.13      As in the north, social and agricultural services to farmers are
limited, although the latter are now being improved under the ongoing project.
However, the need for improved water supplies in EAP is not so acute as in
NAP and improvements can be delayed until some later phase of development.
3.14      The farming system reflects the greater reliability of the area's
dry season rainfall, and its better soils. Thus cocoa, coffee and oil palm
are of major importance; and there is greater potential for swamp rice devel-
opment than in the north, due to a greater area of swamps and more favorable
soils. Upland cultivation follows a shifting pattern and 20% of the upland
areas are cultivated each year with fallow periods rarely exceeding 6 - 7
years. Due to increasing land pressure there is a tendency to move toward
an increased exploitation of swamps. Average farm size is generally smaller,
2 - 3 acres of upland cultivation, and some 40% of the farmers cultivating
in addition 1 - 3 acres of swamp. The land tenure system is basically the
same as in the north, but because population pressure is less, the problems
over "begged-land" are less likely to arise.
3.15      Yields levels of upland and swamp rice are similar to those in the
north, 1,200 lb and 500 lb husk rice/acre respectively. .There is no accurate
data on cocoa and coffee yields, but these are estimated at not more than
300 lb/acre annually.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. General
4.01      The Eastern and Northern area projects have two principal objectives.
First, to increase agricultural production and thus farm incomes through pro-



- 7 -
ject actions. Second, to establish in the Eastern and Northern areas systems
of farmer support services that should remain in perpetuity to serve as the
means for delivering further technology packages to their farmer communities.
Currently Sierra Leone has a nation-wide agricultural extension service, but
because in the past, due to the lack of staff, funds and clear programs, it
has been unable to do much to help farmers; the general stagnation in the agri-
cultural sector described in Chapter II is a consequence of this weakness. The
establishment and operation of a complex of services for farmers is expensive,
and while Bank Group funds would help initiate them, the impact and usefulness
of the services so created would diminish rapidly if adequate support is not
available after the proposed IDA credit and Bank loan have been disbursed. As
Sierra Leone's fiscal situation is difficult, the risk that sufficient finance
would not be available to support these services in the post project period
should not be discounted; consequently it would be a feature of the two proj-
ects that those service functions involving credit and input supply would be
designed to permit transfer as soon as possible to farmer owned and operated
commercial agencies. Once firmly established such agencies would not require
Government financing for their operation. Additionally, projects of this kind
enjoy during the disbursement period of project funds a high degree of autonomy
and work relatively independently of the existing national agricultural ser-
vices, though with a long-term objective of eventual amalgamation. EAP is
currently at a stage where a degree of amalgamation can be undertaken; in con-
sequence at the commencement of the extension to EAP, the Project Manager
would be responsible for the project as well as those normal agricultural ser-
vices operating outside the project area; the latter affects 20% of the Eastern
Province. In 1978 the autonomy enjoyed by the management unit would fall
away and its services would then be totally reintegrated with the national
agricultural service, albeit that the operations of the service would thus
be more highly concentrated than in other parts of the country. A similar
change in the case of NAP is not proposed since a period of autonomy exten-
ding beyond the loan/credit disbursement period is probably required before
institutions are sufficiently well developed to permit the change. The North-
ern Area Project would be carried out over four years, 1975/76 - 1978/79, and
the Eastern Area Project over two years 1975/76 - 1976/77. The projects would
involve:
(a) For the Northern Area Project
(i) Civil Works
- constructing 20 miles and upgrading 280,miles of
crop extraction roads;
- constructing 200 village wells on a self help basis;
- establishing 5 market centers;
- constructing a training center;
- constructing houses, stores and offices for project
management staff;



- 8 -
(ii) Farm and crop development
- establishing extension and other farmer support
services, and providing these with staff, vehicles
and equipment;
- providing short- and medium-term credit through a
revolving credit fund for labor, pesticides, ferti-
lizers, and irproved planting material to increase
the production of 6,000 acres of inland swamp rice,
25,000 acres of upland rice, and 10,000 acres ef
groundnuts;
- developing a seed multiplication farm;
(iii) Investigations and research
- investigating the potential for future livestock
development and the establishment of three privately
operated cattle ranches;
- researching methods of increasing wood fuel produc-
tion for tobacco farmers;
(b) For the Eastern Area Project
(i) Civil Works
- establishing 12 market centers;
- constructing houses, warehouses and offices;
(ii) Farm and crop development
- expanding extension and other farmer support services
established under the first project;
- providing short-, medium- and long-term credit for
labor, pesticides, fertilizers and improved planting
material to increase the production of 1,800 acres of
inland swamp rice and 36,000 acres of upland rice, to
develop 4,200 acres of inland swamp for rice produc-
tion, and to establish 1,000 acres of cocoa and 1,600
acres of oil palm;
- continuing the development and improvement of seed
multiplication farms;
- establishing a Farmer Finance Company to take over
the activities of the EAP project's revolving Credit
Fund; and



- 9-
(c) Central Support Services
- establishing and staffing a Project Evaluation and Services
Unit in MANR Freetown to provide operational and financial support
for EAP and NAP, and to assist the EAP Farmer Finance Company
and the company that is to be established to manage the oil
palm nucleus estate and mill developed under EAP;
- assisting MANR to prepare new projects for the agricultural
sector by providing consultants for short-term specialist
assignments;
4.02      The existing project management unit at Kenema would be responsible
for EAP activities, and a new project management unit would be established at
Makeni for NAP.
B. Detailed Features
4.03      To avoid repetition, proposals for NAP and EAP are treated together
in the following paragraphs and in each case supportive data can be found
in the respective Supplementary Volumes 2 and 3.
Civil Works
4.04      Crop extraction roads.  Under NAP 280 miles of existing crop extraction
roads would be improved and 20 miles of new road constructed to ensure all
weather access by light traffic in the wet and heavy trucks during the dry
season. The existing road network is generally adequate in extent, but the
roads are in disrepair and require some improvements including improved for-
mation, drainage and culverting. Most of the soils have a high laterite con-
tent and therefore very little surfacing is required. The road construction
and improvement program would be over four years and would include the con-
struction of 20 bridges and 900 pipe culverts. Nearly all construction work
would be carried out by the project on force account since the amount and
type of work is scattered in terms of location and time and would be un-
attractive to major contractors. Petty contractors would be used as much as
possible.
4.05      A minimum of 250 miles of crop extraction road construction and
improvement are essential for the EAP to proceed satisfactorily, for which
Government is seeking assistance from bilateral sources for these roads,
and final arrangements are expected to be conducted shortly with USAID.
During negotiations assurances were obtained that not later than December 1,
1975, arrangements would be made for the construction and improvement of roads
in EAP that were satisfactory to the Bank.
4.06      Village wells.  The project would assist villages in NAP to construct
200 hand dug wells. The villages would provide all the labor, and the project
technical supervision, building supplies and hand pumps.



- 10 -
4.07      Market centers.  The project would establish five market centers
in NAP and twelve market centers in EAP for input distribution and produce
buying. Each center would comprise a warehouse (8,000 ft3) for storage of
fertilizers, seeds and pesticides, and offices. Facilities including scales
would be provided at the center for both statutory and private marketing
operations.
4.08      Training center.  The project would construct a new 40 bed training
center for NAP. The center would be used for farmer and staff training on the
same basis as the successful training scheme currently operated by EAP.
4.09      Houses, offices and stores.  The project would construct buildings
required for project staff and operations. These include, for NAP, 8 staff
houses, 7 offices, and 2 stores; and for EAP 4 houses and a store. All other
accomodation for both EAP and NAP would be rented. Construction would
normally be undertaken by contractors, available in both areas, and force
account would be undertaken only in exceptional circumstances. Building
supervisors would be employed to ensure that construction standards were
satisfactory.
Farm and Crop Development
4.10      Extension and farmer support services.  Administrative, technical
and commercial staff would be provided under the project. This would mean
for NAP and EAP respectively employment of up to 104 and 136 staff of all
categories. Where called for, staff would be provided with vehicles and
other equipment. (Details are in Annex 3.)
4.11      Inland valley swamp development.  Based on EAP experience the project
would improve the production of rice on 6,000 acres of inland valley swamp
in NAP through better water control and drainage methods. In EAP some 1,800
acres would be improved, and 4,200 acres of undeveloped inland swamp brought
into rice production, bringing the total EAP swamp development program to
12,000 acres.
4.12      Upland crop development.  Uplands provide 60% of Sierra Leone's
national rice production, and the project would aim at achieving production
increases in rice and groundnuts providing improved seed under mass saturation
programs 1/. In NAP, improved fungicide-treated rice varieties such as ROK I,
II, and III (T52) and LAC 23 would be distributed to farmers. This should
result in 25,000 acres of higher yielding rice; 36,000 acres of upland rice
in EAP would be similarly improved. In NAP groundnuts are an important upland
crop and using similar mass saturation techniques, improved varieties would
be introduced over the 10,000 acres now sown to low yielding varieties.
1/   The complete evacuation of old seed from a rural unit (such as a village)
in exchange for improved seed.



- 11 -
4.13      Little is known about the response of rice (particularly under
mixed cropping) and groundnut to fertilizers under upland conditions in
Sierra Leone. Consequently fertilizer application would be approached cau-
tiously with emphasis being given initially to fertilizer use on the permanent-
ly cropped soils that constitute about 10% of total.
4.14      Tree crop development.  The project would extend existing EAP proj-
ect oil palm plantings by 1,600 acres to 4,150 acres. Participation would
be restricted to smallholders who would be permitted to plant a maximum of
10 acres. Oil palm seedlings produced by the Daru Oil Palm Company, that is
to be formed under the project, would be purchased for distribution to farmers.
The harvested fruit bunches would be purchased by the Company at road side buying
points. A further 1,000 acres of cocoa would be planted (4 acres maximum per
farmer) bringing total EAP project cocoa plantings to 1,750 acres.
4.15      Seed multiplication.  NAP would establish a fully irrigated 100 acre
seed multiplication farm, and the two existing EAP rice seed farms (total
50 acres) would be improved. The national Rice Research Station at Rokupr
would supply foundation seed to the seed farms for multiplication and the
project would sell improved seed direct to farmers or to registered seed pro-
ducers for further multiplication. In the latter case the project would be
responsible for cleaning and dressing seed prior to distribution. EAP would
establish a new cocoa seed garden as a first step towards initiating an expanded
cocoa development program envisaged from 1978 onwards.
4.16      Supply of inputs.  Farm inputs would be provided to farmers both
for cash and credit. Currently EAP operates a revolving credit fund, but prior
to December 31, 1975, Government would establi3h a farmer finance company to
take over its functions. NAP would establish a revolving credit fund as in
the first stage of EAP. In both instances seasonal credit would be provided
for fertilizers, seeds, and pesticides, and medium- and long-term credit for
swamp development, and for the establishment of cocoa and oil palm. Details
on the organizational arrangements for credit are at Chapter VI.
Investigations and Research
4.17      Livestock development.  The project would develop three 1,000 acre
privately owned and operated pilot cattle ranches, and would provide technical
assistance and limited credit for stall-fattening of cattle and for pig breed-
ing. The investigations into cattle and pig production would be a forerunner
for an expanded livestock program that might be developed over a wider area
in the north at some future time.
4.18      Wood fuel production.  The Rokel Tobacco Leaf Company has established
a modest fire cured and flue cured tobacco program in Northern Sierra Leone.
The project would not include any aspect of the Company's successful program
but would assist the Forestry Division of MANR to undertake a series of trials
to determine a future wood fuel plantation program to provide fuel wood for
tobacco curing.

Central Support Services
4.19      Project Evaluation and Services Unit (PESU) would be set up within
MANR Freetown to provide operational and financial support for NAP, EAP and
other special agricultural projects that might be developed in the future (see
para. 6.04). PESU staff and support costs would be funded under the project.
4.20      Support to Daru Oil Palm Company.  The existing EAP, Government op-
erated, oil palm estate and mill would be taken over by a compan,7, the Daru
Oil Palm Company (see para. 7.06) to be formed for that purpose.  The project
would provide funds to cover the cost of an experienced and internationally
recruited General Manager. During negotiations it was agreed that the General
Manager would be appointed on terms, conditions and with qualifications satis-
factory to the Bank.
V. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS
A. Project Costs
5.01      Project costs are estimated to be Le 11.4 million (US$13.7 million)
of which the foreign exchange component would be Le 5.0 million (US$6.0 mil-
lion) or 44% of total project costs.
5.02      The breakdown of project costs is detailed in Annex 5, in Supplemen-
tary volumes 2 and 3, and is summarized in the following Table:

5.03               Project costs are incremental based on prices ruling at June 1, 1974,
and exclude all identifiable taxes. Physical contingencies comprise 5% of base
line costs and price contingencies allow for compounded increases in costs
of: (a) vehicles, plant and farm inputs (excluding fertilizer) of 14% in
1974, 12% in 1975, 10% in 1976, and 8% in 1977, 78 and 79; (b) houses, build-
ings and construction materials for roads and water supplies of 18% in 1974,
16% in 1975, 14% in 1976 and 12% in 1977, 78 and 79; and (c) salaries for
local staff and other local costs of 12% in 1974 with a pro rata reduction
to 8% in 1979. Price contingencies are not included for fertilizers as Bank
projections indicate that the average 1980 current prices should be not higher
than current 1974 prices. Analysis of costs show that (a) 29% is for EAP, 63%
for NAP and 8% for support services to MANR in Freetown, and (b) on another
basis 17% is for project infrastructure, 20% for incremental farm inputs, 3%
for assistance to project related institutions, and 60% for support services
to farmers. The latter includes staff costs for the extension, development
and credit components of the project, as well as the houses, offices, vehicles
and other backup needed by such staff.

B. Proposed Financing
5.04      The Bank Group's share in project financing would be an IDA credit
of US$5.0 million on standard terms and an IBRD loan of US$5.0 million at
8-1/2% repayable over 25 years including a five year grace period for princi-
pal during which interest and commitment charges would be paid. The Bank
group contribution would be equivalent to 73% of total project costs and would
cover all foreign exchange costs estimated at Le 5.0 million (US$6.0 million)
and 52% of local costs estimated at Le 3.3 million (US$4.0 million). Of the
US$10.0 million, Le 0.8 million IS$1.0 million) would be for support services
to centralized institutions; Le 1.9 million (US$2.3 million) would be for
EAP; Le 3.6 million (US$4.3 million) would be for NAP; and the remainder
Le 2.0 million (US$2.4 million) would be for contingencies. In EAP US$1.2
million (Le 1.0 million) would be for loans to farmers, and in NAP US$0.8
million (le 0.7 million).
5.05      SLG would finance 26% of project costs amounting to Le 2.9 million
(US$3.5 million). The remaining 1% of project costs or Le 0.17 million
(US$0.2 million) would be contributed by participating farmers through cash
purchases of seasonal inputs. Details of the project financing plan are
shown at Annex 5, and are summarized below:

5.06      During negotiations it was agreed that retroactive financing of up to
US$100,000 (Le 83,000) would be available for the employment of a Financial
Controller for PESU and the Project Manager and Accountant for NAP (para 6.09).
Such financing would apply from March 31, 1975.
C. Procurement
5.07      Procurement of vehicles, plant, equipment, fertilizers, pesticides,
and tools under contracts with a value of more than Le 20,000 (US$24,000), would
be through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank



- 16 -
guidelines. Such procurement is estimated to have a value of about Le 1.4
million (US$1.7 million). A maximum limit totalling US$200,000 would be set
for those items purchased through contracts of less than US$24,000. Domes-
tically manufactured goods would be allowed a 15% preference when comparing
domestic bids with those of foreign manufacturers. Contracts for the con-
struction of buildings, houses, and the purchase of construction materials
and furnishings valued at Le 1.1 million (US$1.3 million) would not be
attractive to foreign contractors due to the dispersed location of the work
and the small size of individual contracts; for these items, con.racts would
be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally ani in
accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank; in these cases foreign
firms and suppliers would not be precluded from bidding. Road construction
would be carried out on force account due to the shortage of suitable con-
tractors. A large part of project costs, an estimated Le 6.3 million (US$7.6
million) would be for labor, staff salaries and allowances, consultants,
vehicle maintenance and operation, planting materials, and general services,
that would be unsuitable for competitive bidding. The remaining Le 2.6 million
(US$3.1 million) of estimated project costs would be contingencies. Sierra
Leone has no preferential import tariff arrangements.
D. Disbursement
5.08      The proceeds of the IDA Credit (US$5.0 million) and IBRD loan
(US$5.0 million) would be disbursed over four years to cover 73% of total
project costs against the following categories:



- 17 -
Cat. 1          100% of the cif cost of directly imported
vehicles, heavy plant, and equipment (or 87%
of the cost of these items if locally pro-
cured), totalling US$0.9 million (Le 0.7 mil-
lion)
Cat. 2          100% of the cif cost of directly imported
fertilizer totalling US$0.5 million (Le 0.4
million)
Cat. 3          100% of the cost of internationally recruited
staff and consultants, totalling US$1.4 million
(Le 1.2 million)
Cat. 4          70% of the total cost of buildings, houses,
furnishings, construction materials for roads
and wells, local staff, support services, and
vehicle and plant operation, totalling US$ 3.8
million (Le 3.2 million)
Cat. 5          70% of farm inputs other than fertilizers,
including seeds, planting materials, pesticides,
fungicides, herbicides, tools, hired labor,
spraying machines, totalling US$ 1.0 million
(Le 0.0 million)
Cat. 6         An unallocated amount totalling US$ 2.4 million
(Le 2.0 million) to cover physical and price
contingencies
5.09      Disbursements would be against import documentation, contracts, and
certified records of expenditures. For disbursement made against certified
records of expenditures, documentation would not be submitted for review as
a matter of course, but would be retained by the respective management units
for scrutiny by Bank supervision missions. Any surplus loan funds after
completion of the project would after consultation with the Bank be used to
further develop the project areas.
E. Budgetary Control, Funding Procedures, Accounts, and Audits
5.10      Budgets.  Annual budgets would be prepared by NAP and EAP, and
included in the MANR development budget. The management of each unit would
submit monthly cash flow estimates containing costs, revenues, and working
capital requirements to PESU for approval and Government funding.
5.11      Funding Procedures.  SLG would set up accounts with commercial banks
for PESU and for NAP with initial sums of Le 20,000 and Le 100,000 respectively.



- 18 -
During negotiations, agreement was obtained that as a condition of credit
effectiveness, SLG would furnish the Bank with satisfactory evidence that
the bank accounts had been established, that initial payments had been made
anid that procedures satisfactory to the Bank to ensure that adequate funds
are available at all times in such accounts have been agreed between SLG and
the bankers for NAPMU, EAPMIU and PESU.
5.12      Accounts and Audits.  Separate accounts maintained for NAP, EAP,
PESU, and the Farmer Finance Company would be kept under acceptable commercial
accounting procedures which would also provide cost accounting and project
evaluation data. All accounts would be audited annually by independent audi-
tors acceptable to the Bank. Audited annual accounts, balance sheets, and
operating statements for NAP, EAP, FFC, and PESU would be submitted to the
Bank within four months of the closing of the financial year. Assurances to
this effect were obtained during negotiations.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Organization
6.01      The NAP would be managed by the Northern Area Project Management
Unit (NAPMU) that would be established for this purpose and the EAP would
be managed by the existing Eastern Area Project Management Unit (EAPMU).
6.02      A Project Advisory Committee (PAC) that was established under
the ongoing project to coordinate the activities of MANR and other Government
Departments concerning the project would be expanded to cover NAP. The Per-
manent Secretary of MANR would continue to be chairman, and members, as now,
would include representatives of the Ministries of Finance, Local Government,
W4orks and Development, the National Development Bank, Produce Marketing Board,
and Rice Corporation. Additionally, the following personnel from MANR would
be members: Chief Agriculturist, Assistant Chief Agriculturist (Projects),
Financial Controller and Projects Economist of PESU (see para 6.04), and the
Managers of NAPMU and EAPMU.
6.03      Project Coordinating Committees (PCC) would be established for NAP and
EAP to advise project management on local affairs and to assist management
in its dealings with the Chiefdom authorities. The Committees would meet
monthly and would comprise the Provincial Secretary-Chairman, Provincial
Agricultural Officer, Divisional Officers for Works, Health, and Education,
three farmer representatives and a senior Paramount Chief. 1/ In each case
the project manager would be Secretary.
1/   In addition, the Manager of the Rokel Tobacco Leaf Company would be a
Committee member for NAP.



- 19 -
6.04      A Project Evaluation and Services Unit (PESU) would be established
in MANR reporting directly to the Permanent Secretary. PESU would oversee
and assist the Project Management Units in order to (a) ensure effective fin-
ancial control and flow of funds to the projects; (b) assist in maintaining
adequate accounts; (c) formulate credit and farm input supply systems; (d)
evaluate ongoing projects; and (e) generally provide support for the two pro-
jects as well as other agricultural development schemes being implemented by
MANR. Importantly PESU would be responsible for the procurement arrangements
of the two projects, for submitting reimbursement claims to the Bank, and for
the internal audit of the two projects. PESU would be headed by a Financial
Controller with appropriate accounting and administrative experience. The
Controller would be supported by a Commercial Services Officer who would have
special responsibility for helping the projects develop satisfactory credit
and input supply systems; and a Projects Economist who would be responsible
for the evaluation of ongoing projects and the evaluation of new projects
proposed by the Divisional Planning Units of MANR.
6.05      During negotiations it was agreed that a condition of credit and
loan effectiveness would be the establishment, with terms of reference satis-
factory to thy Bank, of NAPMU, and the redefinition of the responsibilities
and terms of reference for EAPMU in line with the various proposals made in
this project. Additionally assurances were obtained that the two Project
Committees would be established within 3 months of credit/loan effectiveness.
6.06      Project Administration.  The Permanent Secretary of MANR would have
direct responsibility for the two projects. The Permanent Secretary would in
consultation with the project managers, appoint a senior staff member of each
project as Deputy Project Manager. The EAP Project Manager would also be
responsible for areas of the Eastern Province (20%) outside the EAP, for
which he would delegate day-to-day responsibilities to a Senior Agricultural
Officer. Details of the two project management units are given in Annex 3
together with organizational charts.
6.07      Each project management unit would be divided into five sections
responsible for the following operations:
-    Administration and Personnel:  personnel, staff transportation,
registry, security, and public relations;
-    Finance:  project accounts, procurements, stores, internal
audit, budgetary control;
-    Extension and Training:  extension, staff and farmer training,
seed multiplication and research;
-    Conservation and Land Development:  land use planning, data
collection, specialist surveys in land and swamp development,
water control surveys, and, where appropriate, construction
of roads and water supplies, and supervision of building
development and other civil works;



- 20 -
Commercial Services:  supply of farm inputs, credit, and coordi-
nation of processing and marketing activities as required.
Commercial Services would maintain close marketing links with
agencies such as the Rice Corporation and Produce Marketing
Board.
6.08      Agricultural Project Evaluation and Planning.  MANR is strengthening
its planning capabilities to formulate new projects and evaluate ongoing pro-
jects. PESU would be provided with data by the projects for evaluation and
would issue regular evaluation reports on project progress.
B. Staffing and Consultants
6.09      While most positions in the two projects would be filled by nationals
it is probable that some positions would have to be filled by internationally
recruited staff in the absence of experienced Sierra Leonean personnel. In
management positions it would appear that the Project Manager, NAPMU, and
Financial Controller, PESU, would have to be recruited internationally. During
negotiations it was agreed that a condition of credit/loan effectiveness would
be that the Project Manager and Accountant for NAPMU and the Financial Con-
troller for PESU would have been appointed on terms, conditions and with quali-
fications and experience acceptable to the Bank.
6.10      As Sierra Leone is critically short of experienced high level tech-
nical staff, international recruitment would probably be required for some of
the Senior technical positions. During negotiations assurances were obtained
that whether internationally or locally recruited SLG would appoint on terms
and conditions and with qualifications satisfactory to the Bank (i) the Pro-
ject Manager, Accountant, Commercial Officer, Extension and Training Officer,
Conservation and Land Development Officer, Livestock Officer and Construction
Engineer for NAPMU; (ii) the Project Manager, Accountant, Commercial Officer,
Extension and Training Officer, and Conservation and Land Development Officer
of EAPMU; and (iii) the Financial Controller and Commercial Services Officer
of PESU.
6.11      Other Project Staff.  The great majority of project staff would be
obtained through transfers within MANR and from other Government Departments,
from the commercial sector, or through special in service training courses
established by NAP and EAP. It would be important that a critical minimum of
staff were in post prior to the start of the first cropping season and during
negotiations assurances were obtained that eight professional officers or
experienced technical officers and 30 agricultural field assistants would be
appointed to NAP within 6 months of credit effectiveness.
6.12      Most project staff would be appointed as pensionable Government
employees and salaries generally would follow Government scales, although
inducement benefits would be provided where necessary. Internationally
recruited staff as well as some specialist Sierra Leonean staff such as sur-



- 21 -
veyors, sales agents, and accountants etc. would be appointed on three year
contracts.
6.13      About 20 man months of individual consultant time would be financed
under the credit to assist MANR in project preparation, evaluation and other
specialist areas. During negotiations assurances were obtained that employ-
ment be for purposes agreed with the Bank, and that the consultants so employ-
ed would be acceptable to the Bank.
C. Staff and Farmer Training
6.14      NAPMU and EAPMU would train their junior staff at project established
training centers. EAP experience is that practical courses of one or two days,
and at the longest of one week, are the most effective.
6.15      Farmer training at EAP has been very successful, particularly for
swamp rice. Courses are for one week's duration. EAP also operates special
courses for Chiefdom Agricultural Demonstrators, who are paid employees of
the Chiefdoms and who after training return to advise farmers. This type of
course is proven at EAP and would be continued and introduced under the NAP.
D. Farm Inputs - Procurement, Distribution, and Credit Procedures
6.16      NAP and EAP would be responsible for the procurement, distribution,,
and sale, for cash or credit, of fertilizers, seeds, seedlings, pesticides,
fungicides, and other farm inputs to project participants (see Supplementary
Volumes 2 and 3 for details). It is expected that initially about 90% of
the seasonal inputs would be sold on credit. The gross value of inputs re-
quired during the project development period is estimated at Le 1.2 million
for fertilizers; Le 0.5 million for seeds and seedlings; Le 0.04 million for
fungicides and pesticides; and Le 0.8 million for cash credit and tools for
swamp development. In addition, Le 20,000 would be available to farmers for
the purchase of cattle and pigs under the NAP livestock development component.
6.17      Farm Inputs.  The Commercial Services Sections (CSS) of EAP and NAP
would be responsible for input supply. Most importantly, however, the aim of
both CSS would be to develop farm input organizations that eventually could be
run by the participants themselves as either corporate or cooperative ven-
tures. Sales of inputs would be made by area salesmen operating from the
market centers described in para 4.07; salesmen would be salaried project
staff, but they would receive bonuses related to sales. To encourage volume
sales, which would reduce CSS expenses, discounts would be offered to farmer
groups buying in bulk in the case of fertilizer those purchasing 5 tons or
more; and conversely for those buying less than one ton, a 10% premium would
be added. The CSS would be responsible for the sale of seeds produced by the
project's seed multiplication farms, and would offer spraying services to rice,
cocoa, and oil palm growers.



- 22 -
6.18      Subsidies.  Currently SLG provides farmers with subsidies of up to
70% of the real cost for fertilizers, and tractor and equipment are hired
at subsidized costs. In 1973 about 90% of agriculture subsidies went to
relatively large rice farmers in the Boliland areas that engage in at best a
marginal and probably a sub-economic system of production. The current farm
gate price of husk rice is equivalent to US$240 per ton, one of the highest
prices in West Africa. The crop budgets discussed in para 7.10 and detailed in
Supplementary Volumes 2 and 3 show that current and projected prices are a
sufficient incentive for farmers to grow swamp and upland rice without sub-
sidies, and it would appear that Government could remove the subsidies without
endangering production. Consequently, the subsidy program seems unnecessary.
If the current fertilizer subsidy is applied to NAP and EAP, it would add an
additional cost over the life of the project of about Le 1.5 million (US$1.8
million) to Government's already difficult fiscal position. During negotia-
tions it was proposed that under the project, project farmers should not
receive any subsidy for fertilizer. The proposal was unacceptable to Govern-
ment for political and operational reasons. However it was recognized that
subsidies were not warranted on economic and financial grounds. SLG gave
assurances that subsidies to project farmers would be reduced by 30% (at the
present rate, representing a saving of Le 0.5 million on the first four years
of the project); and that by March 31, 1976 SLG would provide the Bank with
proposals for the reduction or removal of all agricultural input subsidies,
and would consult with the Bank on the implementation of such proposals.
Credit
6.19      The project's credit systems would be linked closely with Chiefdom
administrations, a system that has worked well in EAP. A Credit Advisory
Committee (CAC) would be formed in each development area to appraise the
status and credit worthiness of applicants, and its members would be leading
farmers from the area. Borrowers would either be individuals, or in some
instances, particularly for swamp development, an individual representing a
group of farmers. If the latter is adopted, substantial savings in the cost
of loan processing could be effected. Currently EAP development loans carry
an 8% interest rate and seasonal loans a fixed charge of 10%. To avoid dis-
crepancies between existing and new borrowers these rates would be maintained.
Farmers would be able to receive development loans to establish up to 10
acres of oil palm, 4 acres of cocoa and about 3 acres of swamp rice. For the
latter there would be no fixed acreage limit, since groups of farmers may be
offered a single loan to develop a swamp as a whole. Development loans for
oil palm would average Le 130 per acre at 8% over 13 years with a four year
grace period for principal and interest; for cocoa Le 150 per acre at 8% over
12 years with a four year grace period for principal and interest (interest to
be capitalized for oil palm and cocoa); and for swamp rice loans depending on
the type of swamp between Le 45 to Le 70 per acre at 8% over 5 years. De-
velopment loans would be in kind for seedlings, fertilizers and implements,
and in cash for labor. Seasonal loans for crop inputs would be in kind and
amounts would vary depending on the type of input package offered to the farmer
(see details in Supplementary Volumes 2 and 3).



- 23 -
6.20      Recovery of oil palm loans would be through a cess of Le 11 per ton
of fresh fruit bunches applied to deliveries at the mill. Repayments of all
other loans would be in cash by the borrower. In order to encourage debt
repayment, pressures would be applied collectively to villages or groups of
farmers on a basis of group liability, and in those instances when debt pay-
ments are not made, the traditional administrative authorities would be re-
quested to assist in their recovery.
6.21      Credit Institutions.  Under the ongoing EAP a revolving credit fund
is managed by the EAP credit manager. The fund is held in a bank deposit
account, separate from other project accounts. The system is satisfactory so
far, but Government and the Bank agree that a more permanent and institution-
alized credit system is necessary. Consequently it is proposed that project
credit should be handled and controlled by a Farmer Finance Company (FFC).
Government would own Le 1.4 million class A shares in FFC, of which 400,000
would be in the name of the National Development Bank (NDB), both with full
voting rights but no dividends. There would also be 100,000 class B shares,
each valued at Le 1 with voting rights and dividend entitlements, some of which
would be held by farmers who would purchase them as a condition of obtaining
FFC credit. Class B shares would also be available to three commercial banks
who have indicated a desire to participate. Final equity holding of NDB and
its precise linkage with FFC would be determined during the forthcoming apprais-
al of NDB by the Bank. The FFC Board would comprise representatives of NDB-
chairman, the commercial banks, PESU, and EAPMU, and two farmers appointed by
the Paramount Chiefs of EAP. Details of FFC and proposed memorandum and
articles of association are at Supplementary Volume 3. FFC headquarters would
be at Kenema, a small operational staff would be employed, which would work
closely with EAP's CSS. Due to the relatively small turnover during its first
two years of operations FFC would incur losses. SLG would provide grants of
up to Le 50,000 a year to FFC to cover losses incurred during the first two
years of operation. During negotiations assurances were obtained that SLG
would establish not later than December 31, 1975, the EAP FFC, with memorandum
and articles of association, board of directors, operational procedures and
staffing satisfactory to the Bank.
6.22      A revolving credit fund would be formed and operated by NAPMU with
the objective of converting it to a FFC at a later date.
6.23      Source of Funds.  Loans to participating farmers would be made out
of funds provided under the project. On repayment, the funds would, in the case
of EAP, be held as Government equity in FFC, and for NAP in the revolving credit
fund established for that purpose. By 1978, sufficient equity would have been
built up in FFC to allow it to operate independently on a self financing
basis. Thereafter, any further loan funds could be borrowed by FFC at con-
ventional rates from NDB and the commercial banks.

VII. PRODUCTION, MARKETS, FARMERS' BENEFITS, AND
FINANCIAL IMPLICATION TO GOVERNMENT
A. Production
7.01      The complexities of cropping mixtures and patterns in the project
areas make yield variations between farms inevitable and substantial. Pre-
development yields are based on questionable statistical data adjusted on
the basis of field experience. Estimated postdevelopment yields are based
on EAP results to date, and analysis of research data in Sierra Leone and
neighboring countries with similar ecological conditions. Details are pro-
vided in Supplementary Volumes 2 and 3 and are summarized below:

search results have been reduced by at least half to allow for the size of

research plots and for large numbers of farmers. Incremental production for
NAP at full development 1/ would be 5,400 tons of husk rice and 1,100 tons
of groundnuts (equivalent to about 1,600 tons unshelled nuts); and for EAP,
inclusive of the initial phase, 12,600 tons of husk rice, 550 tons of cocoa,
3,200 tons of palm oil and 750 tons of palm kernels. In total, the project
would produce about 18,000 tons of incremental husk rice (about 10,500 tons
of white rice), equivalent to about 20% of 1973 imports.
B. Markets and Prices
7.03      Marketing and pricing policies (see Annex 2 for details) would
continue to be reviewed and, where possible, improved during the project.
No major changes are envisaged for. SLPMB and Rice Corporation. However, the
Rice Corporation would be required to actively participate in NAP and EAP
and provide a floor price and an alternative outlet to the farmers.
7.04      Rice.  Although statistics are weak, it is estimated that by 1978
rice consumption would reach 385,000 tons, 75,000 tons more than in 1973
when 42,000 tons were imported. It is estimated that the market-dependent
population in 1981 would require 128,000 tons of milled rice, or depending
on milling outturn, a husk rice equivalent of about 180,000 tons. Current-
ly, 86,000 tons or 49% of 1981 requirements are being marketed. Project-
produced rice would therefore substitute for imports. It is expected that
most of the EAP incremental rice would be marketed, but as NAP farmers' home
rice consumption is currently below average, a proportion of NAP production
may be retained. Economic farm gate prices are based on projections made by
the Bank's Economic Analysis and Projections Division, for Thai milled 5%
broken F.O.B. Bangkok and adjusted for 15% broken. Economic farm gate prices
for 1985 (in constant 1974 prices) are estimated at Le 159 and Le 163 per ton
husk rice for EAP and NAP, respectively, compared to a current price of about
Le 230.
7.05      Groundnuts.  In the early 1950's Sierra Leone was a small exporter
of groundnuts, but currently imports about 1,400 tons (3,100 tons groundnut
equivalent) of soft oils. Incremental production would therefore effectively
be import substitution, with an economic value related to that of the cheapest
acceptable vegetable oil. For practical purposes, prices have been calcu-
lated on the basis of the Bank projections for Nigerian groundnuts delivered
Freetown. Economic farm gate prices are estimated for 1985 (in constant 1974
prices) at Le 171 per ton compared with current values of Le 239. In the
past, SLPMB treated groundnuts as a statutory crop and established annual
floor prices. As groundnut production would be an important component of
NAP it would be necessary to reestablish a guaranteed floor price. During
1/   Full development for rice and groundnuts coincides with the completion
of loan and credit disbursements, i.e., 1979, for cocoa 1984, oil palm
1986.



- 26 -
negotiations, assurances were obtained that SLPMB would gazette groundnuts
as a statutory crop, prepare a price formula satisfactory to the Bank, and
publish floor price not later than December 31, 1975.
7.06      Palm Oil.  Domestic production is declining and the supply/demand
balance is expected to worsen with a deficit of 12,000 tons predicted for
1980. Local prices for palm oil are above world levels and there would be
no problems in marketing project produced oil. To ensure efficient outgrower
ffb collection, optimal prices, and proper marketing and financial control,
it is important that the oil palm estate and palm oil mill established under
the ongoing EAP is formed into a Company. Government has agreed and
assurances were obtained that SLG, not later than September 15, 1975,
would establish the Daru Oil Palm Company with memorandum and articles
of association acceptable to the Bank; and that a pricing formula, accept-
able to the Bank for the purchase of fresh fruit bunches from project
farmers would be included. Details on the establishment of Daru oil Palm
Company, cash flows, projected balance sheets, and the Company's memorandum
and articles of association, which were agreed at negotiations, are at
Supplementary Volume 3.
7.07      Project palm kernels would be sold to SLPMB to be crushed at its
mill near Freetown. Economic and financial mill gate prices are estimated
on a basis of import substitution for palm oil and export parity for palm
kernels and kernel oil. Using Bank projected prices (in constant 1974 prices)
the 1985 millgate price for palm oil is estimated at Le 270 per ton (currently
Le 419) and for palm kernels Le 132 per ton.
7.08      Cocoa.  Project cocoa production would account for 5% of expected
national output which represents only 0.5% of world production. The economic
farm gate price for cocoa based on Bank projected prices (in constant 1974
prices) is in 1980 Le 855 per ton.
7.09      The following table summarizes estimated prices for project produced
commodities based on current Bank projections (in constant 1974 prices):

C. Farmer Benefits
7.10      About 14,000 participating farmers would obtain substantial in-
creases in income; and additional indirect benefits from improved roads, water
supplies, and marketing would accrue to a further 65,000 farmers in the pro-
ject areas.
7.11      Estimated direct benefits have been calculated on a per acre basis
for the five principal crops. The summarized crop budgets below compare the
benefits of improved technology over traditional practices within the respec-
tive project areas:

7.12      The main conclusions drawn from the above are:  (a) that when using
unsubsidized fertilizers the returns to swamp rice and permanently cropped
upland rice are attractive, and the incentive is adequate to ensure farmer
response; (b) on the basis of known techniques and field observations, the
returns to improved crop inputs under shifting cultivation are limited,
though the risks are small; and (c) in the case of cocoa and oil palm, the
return per manday is high, particularly where land is available but labor is
limited. For full details, see Supplementary Volumes 2 and 3.
7.13      Project action would result at full development in measureable
increases in annual net family incomes totalling Le 760,000 for NAP or, on
average, Le 95 per directly affected family. The additional total income
for EAP would be about Le 1.3 million annually or Le 215 per directly affected
family. In EAP, per capita incomes would be raised from preproject US$60
to US$100, and NAP, whose family size is nearly double that of EAP, per capita
incomes would rise from US$30 to US$40.



- 29 -
D. Financial Implication to Government
7.14      The project's financial implication to Government's cash flow is
summarized in Annex 5. At full development Government direct revenues would
be minimal with an annual revenue, through export taxes on cocoa and palm
kernels, of only Le 180,000 per annum. Indirect taxation principally through
taxes on consumer goods, estimated at 12% of farm incomes, would additionally
provide about Le 200,000 per annum. Even so the Government deficit, during
the first 10 years of the project, would average Le 0.9 million per annum,
inclusive of IDA credit and IBRD loan repayments. This deficit would in-
crease by a further Le 250,000 per annum if fertilizer subsidies are not
removed. If the farm input supply aspects of the project eventually become
a self-financed operation, then the cost to Government to maintain the re-
maining services established under the project, exclusive of debt repayments,
would be in the order of Le 500,000 per annum. This would not be unreasonable
in the context of Sierra Leone, since the development base established should
in the future provide much improved services to 20% of the country's farmers.
VIII. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
8.01      The project's principal direct benefit would be an incremental in-
crease in farm production which would result in higher incomes for 14,000
farm families, and better living standards for the remaining project popula-
tion, (about 65,000 families) who could benefit through improved infrastruc-
ture and marketing arrangements provided under the project. The estimated
internal economic rate of return for NAP is 14% and for EAP 36%. The combined
rate of return is 26%. Important assumptions used in the calculations at
Annex 6, are:
(a) a shadow wage rate for incremental labor of Le 0.60 and
Le 0.30 per man day for EAP and NAP respectively compared
to the official Government wage of Le 0.85 per day on the
basis that the majority of incremental labor is unpaid family
labor, and that for NAP farmers job opportunities are less,
their per capita incomes are half that of EAP farmers, and
the opportunities to take up new land is extremely limited;
(b) the exclusion of all identifiable taxes from economic costs;
(c) economic farm gate prices in 1974 constant Leone as projected
by the Bank's Economic Analysis and Projections Divisions
(para 7.09) based on export parity for palm kernels and cocoa,
and import substitution for rice, palm oil, and groundnuts;
(d) a sharp reduction in service staff, particularly extension
staff, after the project development period is completed
on the basis that a continued extension effort would only



- 30 -
be warranted if new techniques and innovations are made
available to farmers resulting in increased benefits over
and above those projected under the project;
(e)  the exclusion of road and water development, forestry and
livestock research and, future project preparation costs,
as the benefits attributed to them are intangible; and
(f)  the economic analysis for EAP combines the costs and benefits
of the new investment with that of the ongoing investment
(Credit 323SL). The appraisal report for the ongoing pro-
ject projected a rate of return of 15%, even with relatively
heavy administrative and investment costs required to estab-
lish the project. The new investment is a natural exten-
sion to the ongoing project and is closely linked to overhead
investments already incurred. Indications are that a separate
analysis for the extension of EAP would result in an internal
rate of return considerably higher than the combined rate of
36%. This is particularly so since production levels and sub-
sequent benefits would be at an optimum from the start of the
extension.
8.02      Although the economic viability of NAP is much lower than EAP bene-
fits have been calculated using crop yields that might be exceeded during
project implementation with the introduction of improved seeds and techniques
that are presently unavailable. The economic rate of return is sensitive to
yield increases. For example, increasing NAP benefits by 10%, equivalent to
an incremental 15 lb/acre increase of upland husk rice, the rate of return
would increase to 17%. A full sensitivity analysis for both EAP and NAP is
at Annex 6.
8.03      The project would have important secondary benefits that would
accrue both to the people of the project areas and to the Government as a
whole. The more important ones would be that:
(a)  the people of the project areas would benefit from (i) a
general improvement in communications and, in the case of
NAP, improvement in water supplies and the subsequent re-
duction in dysenteric diseases, (ii) increased farmer par-
ticipation in local development and (iii) improved marketing
facilities;
(b)  the Government of Sierra Leone would benefit through reduced
dependence on imported foods, and in increased exports, which
together at full development would amount to annual foreign
exchange earnings/savings of Le 4.1 million (US$4.9 million);
the realizing of an agricultural development policy that could
be expanded to cover the major rural areas of Sierra Leone; the
strengthening of Government institutions; the commercial reorien-
tation of credit and farm supplies; and assistance to Government
in developing and planning new projects for future implementation.

IX. AGREEMENTS REACHED WITH THE BORROWER
9.01      During negotiations it was agreed that retroactive financing of up
to US$100,000 (Le 83,000) would be available for the employment of a Finan-
cial Controller for PESU, and the Project Manager and Accountant of NAP.
Such financing would apply from March 31, 1975 (AR para 5.06 and CA schedule
1 para 4).
9.02      During negotiations assurances were obtained from SLG that:

(i) SLG would establish not later than December 31, 1975, a
Farmer Finance Company for EAP, with memorandum and arti-
cles of association, board of directors, operational pro-
cedures and staffing satisfactory to the Bank (AR para
6.21 and CA section 3.06);
(j) SLPMB would gazette groundnuts as a statutory crop,
prepare a price formula satisfactory to the Bank and
publish a floor price not later than December 31, 1975
(AR para 7.05 and CA section 4.04); and
(k) SLG, not later than September 15, 1975, would establish the
Daru Oil Palm Company with memorandum and articles of asso-
ciation acceptable to the Bank; and that a pricing formula,
acceptable to the Bank for the purchase of fresh fruit bunches
from project farmers would be included (AR para 7.06 and
CA section 3.08).
9.03      During negotiations it was agreed that conditions of effectiveness
of the credit/loan would be that:
(a) SLG would furnish the Bank with satisfactory evidence that
PESU and NAP bank accounts had been established with initial
payments of Le 20,000 and Le 100,000 respectively and that
procedures satisfactory to the Bank to ensure that adequate
funds are available at all times in such accounts have been
agreed between Government and the bankers for NAPMU, EAPMU
and PESU (AR para 5.11 and CA section 6.01 (b));
(b) SLG would establish with terms of reference satisfactory to
the Bank, NAPMU, and would redefine the terms of reference
for EAPMU (AR para 6.05 and CA section 6.01 (c)); and



- 33 -
(c) the Project Manager and Accountant of NAPMU and the Financial
Controller of PESU had been appointed on terms, conditions
and with qualifications satisfactory to the Bank (AR para
6.09 and CA section 6.01 (d)).
9.04      On the basis of the above assurances and conditions the project
is suitable for an IDA credit of US$5 million and a Bank loan of US$5 million.

SIERRA LEONE
INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II
Administration and Institutions
1.        Background.  Sierra Leone, covering an area of 27,925 square miles,
with an estimated 1973 population of 2.8 million, became an independent
Sovereign state within the British Commonwealth in 1961, and a Republic in
1971. Independence ended a long period of British administration, initially
by Company rule, followed in 1808 by a small Coastal Crown Colony covering
some 256 square miles, to which was added, in 1896 a protectorate administ-
ration covering the remainder of the country.
2.        Local Administration.  For administrative purposes, the country is
divided into the Western Area, covering most of the old Crown Colony, and
three provinces (Northern, Southern and Eastern) covering the old protectorate.
The provinces are each under the control of a Resident Minister, and are
divided into twelve districts (five in the North, four in the South and three
in the East) each administered by a District Officer and supported by a Dis-
trict Council. Each District is divided into chiefdoms administered by
Paramount Chiefs and Chiefdom Councillors with their own treasuries and
chiefdom courts. The District Councils, which originally operated as advisory
bodies, now have extensive functions and powers of precepting on chiefdom
administrations.
3.        Government Agricultural Services.  Responsibility for agriculture
lies with the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR) which
comprises four main divisions covering agriculture, forestry, veterinary and
fisheries. The agriculture division, which is the largest, is responsible
for extension, farmer training and research coordination, and for preparing
investment proposals for the sector. British technical assistance has been
provided for MANR since 1972. National development policy and coordination
between ministries on economic affairs lies with the Ministry of Development
and Economic Planning, which is also responsible for investigation and appli-
cation of external sources of funds and technical assistance for development.
4.        At the regional level, MANR is represented by Principal Agricultural
Officers supported by Agricultural Officers, Agricultural Superintendents and
Agricultural Instructors. MANR is inadequately financed and the staff are
poorly trained. This, coupled with a lack of back-up services and over con-
centration on mechanical cultivation programs, has fragmented and greatly
reduced MANR effectiveness over most of the agriculture sector. Overall
staff/farmer ratio is low (including instructors in training, around 1:2,500
farmers).



Volume 1
Annex 1
Page 2
5.        Training and Research.  Njala University College (NUC) and the
Rice Research Station, Rokupr (RRS) are responsible for agricultural training
and research. NUC includes degree and certificate courses in agriculture and
agricultural education and operates as a regional center for West Africa in
special programs in agricultural education. Approximately 20-30% of annual
enrollment in the sub-degree courses are for students from The Gambia.  Due
primarily to lack of Government investment in the agricultural secto-:, the
demand for degree and certificate holders has been minimal which resulted in
low intakes in the early 1970's. A critical shortage of trained manpower is
forecast by MANR, although based on this, highly optimistic development pro-
posals are anticipated for which finance is, at best, uncertain.
6.        Research is conducted both by NUC and RRS, and a serious problem
has been the lack of coordination between them and MANR. Since the early
1960's, shortages of funds and staff, (and related conditions of service), have
greatly limited research, but assistance is now being provided by UNDP and
the West African Rice Development Association (WARDA), and Government is
considering proposals for an Agricultural Research Institute as part of a
general program of research reorganization.
7.        Development Financing.  There are two national credit organizations
the National Development Bank (NDB) and the National Cooperative Development
Bank (NCDB), the latter concentrating solely on cooperatives. NDB lending
policy is directed towards established entrepreneurs who can offer suitable
collateral for medium and long term loans (3 to 15 years), and generally
limits its financial participation in any one enterprise to a minimum of
US$9,375 and a maximum of US$75,000.
8.        Outside the Eastern Area Project, virtually no institutional credit
is available to smallholders, who rely heavily on village money lenders.
Most farmers have only limited cash reserves and are forced to borrow money
in times of hardship; loans are often secured by pledging land or a future
harvest. While reflecting the high degree of risk involved, effective interest
rates are often extremely high, leading to a debt cycle from which escape is
difficult.
9.        Marketing.  The Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board (SLPMB), a
statutory corporation established in 1949, is responsible for marketing the
country's main export crops. Overseas sales policy is efficiently executed
by the Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Company (SLPMC), a wholly owned London-
based subsidiary. Prices for statutory crops 1/ are fixed annually by Govern-
ment and SLPMB is required to maintain a price stabilization fund. Primary
marketing operations are conducted through licensed buying agents, although
consideration is being given to more direct SLPMB involvement. The present
arrangements, while generally satisfactory, need considerable improvement if
farmers' interests are to be served and agricultural potential adequately
exploited.
1/   Presently cocoa, coffee, ginger and palm kernel.



Volume 1
Annex 1
Page 3
10.       SLPMB policy is still largely conditioned by the consequences of
a technically unsound and politically motivated diversification program which
resulted in near bankruptcy in 1966. Extremely conservative fiscal and
operational policies had to be adopted subsequently to accumulate working
capital and re-establish the stabilisation fund. In recent years SLPMB
operating profits have been earned largely due to a passive pricing policy
where emphasis on stabilisation of producer prices has contributed to the
slow growth of marketed production.
11.       The whole question of crop pricing is being reexamined by Govern-
ment to find a satisfactory balance between maintenance of revenue through
export taxes and the development levy, while simultaneously providing adequate
production incentives and reducing losses from smuggling. The purpose and
role of SLPMB also needs reexamination as the present ad hoc approach to
marketing problems and policies is impeding the realization of full benefits
from agricultural exports as well undermining confidence both at home and
overseas (see Annex 2).
12.       The Rice Corporation was established in 1965 to continue Govern-
ment involvement in rice production and marketing which began in 1936.
Responsibility for production passed to MANR in 1968 and the Corporation's
activities are now confined to importing, and milling and marketing local
rice.
13.       Imports, which can account for over half of the estimated total
rice marketed, have been the main activity of the Corporation as the result-
ing profits finance the marketing of domestic rice. Minimum producer prices
are maintained through a floor price system, the Corporation being the
residual buyer in a largely deficient market. As a result supplies for
economic operation of the three large and rather poorly sited milles owned
by the Corporation are usually inadequate. Nevertheless a more agressive
field buying policy is now being introduced in an attempt to secure a
larger market share; the recent sharp increase in floor price to current
market levels (Le 5.00/bushel) should assist providing adequate financing
arrangements can be made.
14.       The existing 931 registered cooperative societies have played little
part in marketing since the collapse of the Cooperative Marketing Federation
in 1967. In 1970/71 less than 8% of all farm holders were members of local
societies compared with 10% in 1965/66. Efforts are being made to revitalise
the movement, (with expatriate assistance under bi-lateral aid), but shortage
of trained leaders and managers is a severe constraint. This problem is
compounded by the fact that cooperatives are institutions imposed on a
traditional structure and did not result from natural evolution. A National
Cooperative Development Bank was established in 1971 and now has a number of
branches but it is not an important factor and the movement is unlikely to
make any significant impact in the medium term.

INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II
MARKETING, MARKETS, AND PRICES
A. Background Summary
1.        Rice has become the prime staple food of Sierra Leone, although
its importance varies considerably between areas; a surplus/self sufficient
situation changed to one of deficiency in the early 1950's since when imports
of milled rice have averaged about 23,000 tons annually (see Table 1). This
is equivalent to about 10 percent of total consumption and 30 percent of
effective market demand. Recently production appears to have increased at
about the same rate as population but more slowly than demand, which is
estimated at about 250 lb per capita and is expected to reach 385,000 tons
by 1978; 75,000 tons more than in 1973 when some 42,000 tons were imported.
Total incremental production from the two projects of 18,000 tons husk rice,
or about 10,500 tons usable milled rice, will reduce the deficiency in areas
served by the projects and consequently import requirements.
2.        Official intervention in rice marketing is directed towards mini-
mising: consumer prices (by controlling imports) and guaranteeing producer
returns (through a floor price system). These aims are incompatible in some-
degree, but in any case the extent of involvement by the Government agency 1/
has been insufficient to adequately influence prices in either sector.
3.        The greater part of production is processed by traditional hand-
pounding methods, although there are about 200 privately operated, small
Englebert type mills scattered over the country. These mills are believed
to achieve a lower rate of extraction than hand pounding, so increased
consumer demand may require a corresponding increase in husk rice.
4.        The handling, pricing and taxing of export crops is controlled by
Government through a statutory corporation, the Sierra Leone Produce Market-
ing Board (SLPMB). Attention to these crops, which are predominantly perennial
by nature, does not conflict with food crops, but the pricing and taxation
policy has not encouraged their development.

Volume 1
Annex 2
Page 2
B. Statutory Considerations
5.        The marketing, movement and processing of agricultural produce
is affected by three Acts of Parliament: The Control of Goods Act (1962);
The Agricultural Act (1966); and The Factories Act (1974). In addition,
various Ordinances and Acts provide for the establishment of two statutory
marketing organizations; The Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board (SLPMB)
and the Rice Corporation (Corporation).
6.        Both the Control of Goods Act and the Agriculture Act lay down
rules covering handling, storage, movement and quality inspection, while the
former also makes provision for inspection of market places and includes
the obligation on Inspectors to regularly report prices.
7.        The Factories Act superceded The Safe Working and Inspection Act,
and is the only instrument by which control of processing or other agro-
industry may be exercised. The provisions of the old Act, like those cover-
ing price reporting, have been largely ignored, and no formal record exists
of mill numbers, capacities and situations. Efforts are being made under
the new Act to rectify this situation.
8.        The Act establishing the Rice Corporation also stipulates that
only citizens of Sierra Leone "shall buy or sell rice either wholesale
or retail as a trader". This exclusivity does not extend to processing
rice or other produce, nor would it appear to affect the attainment of
LBA status for either of the statutory marketing organizations (in 1971/72
non-indigenous LBA accounted for 68% of the total produce delivered to SLPMB).
9.        The statutory marketing processes differ somewhat between SLPMB
and the Corporation but both come under the Ministry of Trade and Industry
and are essentially franchise operations providing opportunities for mono-
polistic exploitation.
The Rice Corporation (Corporation)
10.       The Corporation was established in 1965, for the "planting, culti-
vation, harvesting, import, export, purchase, transporting, milling, sale
and distribution of rice" in Sierra Leone, 1/ and enjoys sole rights over
importing and exporting. The Corporation's production programs failed to
make any impact, resulting by 1968 in severe financial losses, and conse-
quently Government transferred responsibility for this activity to MANR.
The Corporation has only a small capital (Le 1.55 million) about 40 percent
of which is tied up in fixed assets, primarily rice mills and associated
buildings.

11.       Accounts are not available beyond 30 June 1971, and these have
little relevance at this time except to underline the fact that the Corpora-
tion is not financially equipped to perform much more than a trading function.
However, it was intended to carry out a far more extensive and influential
role.
12.       The operations of the Corporation were to be financed from profits
made through selling imported milled rice at internal prices unrelated to
world levels. Domestic production efforts were to be supported through floor
prices for husk rice related to, but below, the equivalent official selling
prices. In a deficit situation with extensive production and rather small
unrelated centres of intensive demand, the inevitable result has been con-
tinued emphasis on imports, declining participation in primary marketing and
increasing underutilization of high cost milling equipment.
13.       Import requirements are estimated in conjunction with MANR and
supplies usually obtained on a Government-to-Government basis. Rice is
available for sale from Corporation stores and at retail level from Licensed
Selling Agents (LSA). LSA quotas, margins and official selling prices are
fixed in consultation with Government but official prices are difficult, if
not impossible, to enforce and seldom observed.
14.       Day-to-day buying and selling operations have been mainly handled
by licensed agents (LBA and LSA) but a number of buying teams have been
trained by the Corporation. The purpose of these teams, which will operate
from twelve centers spread over the country, is to identify sources of market-
able husk rice and to buy at farm level. This represents a radical departure
from previous practice, particularly as it makes the guaranteed producer price
available to farmgate as well as at nominated Buying Centers. 1/
15.       The Corporation owns disc-sheller type rice mills and associated
parboiling equipment. All the machinery is old, relatively poorly maintained
and uneconomic to operate, a problem which is magnified by the small volume
of husk rice purchases (Tables 1, 2 and 3). The mills are situated as follows:
Theoretical Capacity    /1
Location             Erected                Tons/Hour        Tons/Year

Torma Bum              1956                    1.4              5,600

16.       In addition the Corporation has purchased six small integrated
mills with rubber roller shellers. These were bought primarily for evalua-
tion, althougl it is not clear why six of the same make and type were needed
for this purpose. They have proved unsatisfactory for a number of reasons,
including design defects, and although the only available measured test
report shows a white rice recovery of 74 percent by weight, achieved through-
put was less than 35 percent of that advertised by the manufacturers (Table 4).
The Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board (SLPMB)
17.       The SLPMB was established in 1949 to "secure the most favorable
arrangements for the purchase, export and marketing of Sierra Leone's
produce and to assist in the development by all possible means of the agri-
cultural industry of Sierra Leone for the benefit and prosperity of the
producers and areas of production."
18.       The SLPMB has the sole right to export agricultural produce but
at present only cocoa, coffee, ginger, piassava and benniseed and palm kernels
are handled. SLPMB maintains a price stabilization reserve of Le 2.5 million,
and appears to be very strong financially having recovered from the mis-
management of the mid-1960's which made it virtually bankrupt. The latest
published accounts (to June 30, 1972) show net assets of Le 8.1 million,
including the price stabilization reserve fund which is invested in Government
stock. Le 2.4 million is available in cash or Treasury Bills, while produce
in stock or transit is valued at Le 1.4 million. Debtors stand at Le 486,000,
after bad debt provision of Le 214,000 and creditors at Le 686,000 including
Le 242,000 on Government account.
19.       Guaranteed producer prices payable at nominated trading centres
are linked to export values and fixed annually with the prior approval of
Government. Rural buying and first assembly is carried out by Licensed
Buying Agents (LBA) and subagents. Quality control is the responsibility
of the Produce Inspection Branch (PIB) of MANR who inspect and seal produce
prior to despatch to SLPMB warehouses and reinspect prior to export. Payment
is only made to LBA against delivery of sound marketable produce.
20.       Export sales are arranged by Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Company
Limited (SLPMC) a wholly owned subsidiary of SLPMB. SLPMC enjoys a high
reputation in commodity markets, operates at a cost of about one half of one
percent of cif values and profits are remitted to Government in the form of
dividends.

21.       A duty is levied on all produce exported 1/ and SLPMB is also
required to make an annual contribution of Le 500,000 to the Development Fund,
but is not liable to Income or Corporation tax. Indicative marketing costs,
expressed as a percentage of realized fob values, are as follows:

/2   Expressed as a percentage of Buying Station Price export duty
reaches 18 percent, 14 percent, 29 percent and 13 percent
respectively.
/3   Over the period 1968/69 to 1972/73 net profits have averaged
about 10 percent of turnover (i.e. value of sales including duty).
22.       SLPMB owns nine small palm oil mills of which eight are operating
(compared with five at the time of negotiating Credit 323-SL) all are old,
uneconomic and inefficient. No satisfactorily phased closure program has
yet been made. Oil from these mills is sold by SLPMB at a fixed price
(presently 114 per lb) in an effort to influence the market but is insuffi-
cient for this purpose. The mills have consistently operated at a loss, 2/
a situation that cannot be expected to improve as their inefficiency
directly affects the price that can be paid for ffb, and hence throughput.
1/   Presently expressed as a percentage of fob value as follows:  ginger
5 percent, palm kernels, palm kernel cake 10 percent, palm kernel oil
15 percent, cocoa and coffee 10 percent, plus 1 percent for every
Le 10.00 by which value exceeds Le 400/ton, up to a maximum of 40 percent.
2/   Average annual loss 1967/68 - 1971/72 was about Le 80,000.  Excluding
the period 1964/65 - 1966/67, accumulated loss from 1950 to 1972 exceeded
Le 2 million.



Volume 1
Annex 2
Page 6
23.       SLPMB also owns a palm kernel mill with an annual capacity of
about 35,000 tons of kernels. This was close in 1968 after incurring
losses of Le 150,000 in the first seven months of operation. A complete
rehabilitation program was started in 1973 by a well known international
firm of milling engineers, and in 1974 the Ministry of Trade and Industry
awarded a mill management contract to a London-based company; this includes
sole selling rights for Sierra Leone palm kernel oil and palm kernel cake.
For the marketing process the fee is 5 percent of cif price, ten times
the average cost of marketing through SLPMC, who continue to handle the
export of palm kernels and other produce.
C. Overall Policy, Organization and Crop Pricing
24.       An unduly cautious pricing policy has been maintained over the years;
and the desire to secure tax revenue appears to have obscured the possibilities
of increasing revenue through producer incentives. Also, while SLPMB has been
effectively sequestrating agricultural sector earnings into capital reserves
considerably above those required by law, while still paying taxes at a rate
equivalent to about 18% of turnover, the Rice Corporation has been short of
working capital and unable to develop a marketing policy capable of providing
incentive to stimulate adequate production increases.
25.       Past export crop policy has been directed towards inter-season
stability, price, rather than earnings, and has paid scant attention to the
effects on the producer of the difference between announced prices and
farmgate receipts. This has reduced incentives for new planting, and has
inhibited exploitation of existing perennial crops. The effects of this
policy are impossible to quantify accurately, but for palm kernels alone
have been estimated 1/ to have caused an average annual non-realization of
potential export earnings of Le 1.7 million over the period 1950-1970.
26.       MANR is presently working on export pricing proposals designed
to increase producer incentives while maintaining adequate price support
reserves. These proposals are still in an early stage of development and
care needs to be exercised to avoid theoretically attractive policies whose
benefits can be nullified by difficulty of practical application. Given the
national policy of 'reducing dependence on food imports', 2/ reconsideration
of crop prices must include rice, as well as the mechanics and methods for
ensuring fair and efficient guaranteed producer and consumer prices at farm-
gate and retail levels respectively.
1/   In a paper presented at the Queen Elizabeth House Development Seminar,
Oxford University in February 1974, John Levi used time series data from
which to calculate price elasticity of supply.
2/   1972 budget statement.



Volume 1
Annex 2
Page 7
27.       A rolling three to five year minimum price structure should be
developed, related to projected world prices and production costs. Within
this structure minimum annual prices for perennial crops would be announced
twelve months in advance. Annual crop prices would be announced pre-planting
and confirmed, or increased, prior to the beginning of the marketing season.
Resource Utilization
28.       Marketed production is almost entirely confined to crops with
a high value-volume ratio which make less demands on transport and handling
facilities. Total quantity handled has only once exceeded 120,000 tons, with
the greater part of the work involved (assembly and delivery, or collection
and distribution), being carried out by largely unsupervised agents. At
present this is administered by two statutory organizations operating in
broadly the same geographical areas; both organizations are also responsi-
ble for some form of processing, which is usually unprofitable due to lack
of throughput. Having regard to the slender financial and managerial
resources available this appears inappropriate, relevant though it may have
been to earlier circumstances. It has often been suggested that it would
be desirable to have only one body responsible for all statutory obligations
in agricultural marketing and processing. The creation of a single autono-
mous organization may be justified but reorganization should not be under-
taken without the most careful examination and analysis of policy objectives.
29.       Produce marketing requirements in Sierra Leone fall into four cate-
gories which could dictate the direction of reorganization. There are:
Internal Collection and distribution;
Primary processing;
Shipping and Forwarding; and
Overseas sale and purchase.
30.       Benefits would accrue if corporate responsibilities are realigned
to meet these requirements, emphasis being laid on functions rather than
crops. Processing or conversion responsibilities undertaken by statutory
organizations can lead to waste and development of uneconomic and undesir-
able distribution patterns and examples exist in the rice and oil mills
under public ownership. There is normally only one source of raw material,
the supply of which can be regulated by considerations unrelated to normal
operating requirements. Since rice and palm produce can only be consumed
after processing, a sound foundation exists for development of this section
of agro-industry; consideration should be given to excising existing pro-
cessing units from SLPMB and the Corporation and encouraging additional
investment and expansion.



Volume 1
Annex 2
Page 8
Grading and Classification
31.       There are a large number of varieties and types of rice grown in
Sierra Leone and although farmers tend to differentiate between them when
considering farm/home consumption requirements, this does not apply in the
wholesale husk rice market. 1/ As a consequence offerings are usually mixed
and may contain different origins (i.e., swamp and upland rice) as well as
varieties, although upland rice is generally preferred for home consumption
and swamp rice predominates in the market place. Milling characteristics
and performance vary considerably between varieties, while differences in
grain size cause processing problems reducing either throughput, whole grain
recoveries, or both.
32.       There is urgent need for the introduction of a simple classifica-
tion system, starting possibly with origin, variety and admixture. Presently
there is no price differentiation at Corporation buying points, provided rice
is reasonably sound. Nevertheless the benefits accruing from graded grain
are quantifiable, and the Corporation should be able to devise and apply a
premium pricing structure to discourage farmers from comingling various
varieties and qualities. 2/ Such an effort could well be matched by some
form of seed flushing operation by MANR.
Market Information
33.       Although provision exists for a price reporting service (para 6)
and the Ministry of Labor records some price series for use in the cost of
living index, little has been done to develop comprehensive crop reporting
and market intelligence. There is a marked need for such information.
Limited work of a subjective nature is being carried out by officers in MANR
and the Corporation but the system needs to be expanded and formalized if
market transparence is to be improved and national requirements adequately
forecast and met.
Weights and Measures
34.       Rice and most other produce is traditionally traded by measure
although both SLPMB and the Corporation buy by weight. Measures are of
standard description but not always similar capacity, so value or cost
adjustments can be made without changing price. Standardization and improve-
ment are as necessary as they are difficult and expensive to enforce, but
a start should be made by policing of LBA while Corporation buying teams
could demonstrate the relationship between the two systems.
1/   A rather intricate traditional grade and classification system has been
observed for milled rice, particularly at retail level.
2/   Foreign matter accounted for 3 to 3.7% of husk rice delivered to Kissy
mill in 1972.

D. Individual Crop Marketing
Rice
35.       A major study of rice milling and marketing 1/ financed under Credit
323-SL was completed in early 1974 and is now being considered by Government.
Most previously known qualitative information has been assembled, presented
and analyzed in the report and quantitative production and demand projections
made. Movement and milling requirements have also been stipulated and a
possible policy outlined for improving mill management and operation.
Deficiencies and failings in the present marketing system are highlighted
and specific remedies proposed.
36.       The recommendations include, inter alia:
(a)  establishment of a staggered, regional differentiated
floor price system for husk rice;
(b)  establishment of a National Pricing Committee;
(c)  maintenance of consumer prices at a constant level
through releasing adequate quantities and, if
necessary, by rationing retail sales;
(d)  improvement in market intelligence and statistical
services;
(e)  standardization and enforcement of measures and
(metric) weights;
(f)  aid to the milling industry through training courses
and investment incentives;
(g)  modernization of Rice Corporation mills by introduction
of rubber roller mills of various types;
(h)  replacement of traditional parboiling techniques
by new methods;
(i)  improvement in status, responsibilities and organization
of Rice Corporation to enable it to play a leading part
in implementing recommendations; and
(j) provision of appropriate credit facilities to farmers.

Page 10
37.       A considerable proportion of the conclusions are based on supply
and demand projections. These have necessarily been constructed from a
limited data base, together with some information of uncertain accuracy.
On the supply side total reliance was placed on the 1965/66 and 1970/71
Agricultural Statistical Surveys, using an acreage growth figure, derived
from the differences between the two surveys, to arrive at a 1973 base area.
Averages of the 1965/66 and 1970/71 yield figures were applied to this base
area to achieve a 1973 production estimate, from which annual projections
are made, by districts, through 1983. Various area and yield assumptions
are used to produce 'low', 'medium' and 'high' variants. Subsequent to the
report being published, errors of sampling and calculation have been dis-
covered in the 1970/71 survey, which call into question some of the basic
assumptions and arguments used in the study and invalidates some of the
conclusions. The extent of the discrepancies, which are highlighted in
Table 5, do not, however, have a maj6r impact on the recommendations since
these are generally confined to already well identified areas of system
and organizational imperfection.
38.       Fitting the corrected 1970/71 survey figures to the assumptions
causes the 1973 base production figure to exceed estimated demand, which
did not in fact occur since balancing imports were needed, while use of the
'low variant' results in surpluses being projected for 1978 onwards (Table 6).
Past production performance makes such an event unlikely, although no account
has been taken of possible production response to the recent very sharp
increase in floor price. Space does not permit full analysis of the projec-
tions, nor time a revision of the projections which, given the uncertain data
base and lack of quantitative information, could be just as open to question.
Nevertheless the situation provides a number of pointers to potentially
profitable directions of work for the development of new data.
39.       Whatever the shortcomings of the 1970/71 survey there are no adequate
grounds for rejecting it as an accurate measure of total production compared
to 1965/66, although sampling errors among individual components are suffi-
cient to make detailed projections unrealistic. Nevertheless, available
qualitative and quantitative information makes the estimate of 1973 milled
rice consumption (320,800 tons) look reasonable and probable. Assessing
rice consumption is, however, bedevilled by difficulty in converting to husk
rice equivalent, a problem that is aggravated in Sierra Leone as only a small
proportion of the crop is milled in a manner permitting accurate assessment
of a recovery factor. There are sufficient grounds for the assumption that
75% of husk rice production is hand pounded, and variation in recovery rates
in this sector will have a very significant effect on total white rice
availability. Tests at Njala University resulted in a factor of 0.7 being
used for the conversion of husk rice by pounding, which when combined with
the relevant recovery for mechanical milling (0.53) gave a national average
of 0.66, a figure that is used throughout the study. There is quite a lot
of precedent for this figure, including the 1965/66 Agricultural Statistical
Survey, although the Bank has used .60 in the past. 1/ Nevertheless, 70% rice

recovery is very high by any standards and considerably more than the 55%
estimated by GDI 1/ which is comparable to that achieved with Indica varieties

40.       These figures well example the difficulties inherent in having to
attempt precise projections with a data base better suited to providing
probable indications of magnitude. Much of the information required for
the relatively sophisticated attempt that was made could be accumulated
through the recommended market intelligence service (para 34); in the mean-
time further investigation into traditional recovery rates should be made
at village level, and thought given to the possible effects of elasticity
of consumption among subsistence population on marketed supplies.
Overall Considerations
41.       The pattern of rice marketing has changed considerably since the
late 1950s, primarily as a result of the widespread introduction of small
mills into the private sector. Until this time consumer demands outstripped
traditional processing capacity which resulted in an increasing proportion

Page 12
of husk rice being channelled through the government owned milling centers
at Freetown, Mambolo and Torma Bum. This restricted marketing alternatives
open to producers, and an attractive floor price encouraged the flow of rice
into the statutory system. During the early 1960s the Rice Department, fore-
runners of the Corporation, probably had a share of around 50% of both the
producer (husk rice) market and the consumer (milled rice) market. In broad
terms this latter position has been maintained, but participation in the
primary market, and thus statutory influence on producer prices is now in-
significant (Table 7).
42.       A market share of 25 to 35% is normally sufficient to exert pricing
influence, yet comparison of available consumer price series (compiled by the
Ministry of Labor) and the official selling prices for milled rice indicates
that corporation market activities have had little lasting effect on consumer
prices (Table 8). In the chronic deficiency situation that has developed
over the last two decades this may be ascribed to a number of causes including:
-    inadequate interseason stabilizing stocks;
-    inadequate participation at retail level (i.e., through 'fair
price' shops or by means of applied price controls.
43.       The maintenance of fixed wholesale selling prices without effective
retail price control has caused a two tier price structure to develop, with
the difference between the two levels benefitting traders and merchants
rather than consumers.
44.       A consequence of this has been the creation of a high differential
between market and guaranteed prices for husk rice which has also impeded the
translation of market demand, through price effect, into a production response.
Swamp rice accounts for the greater part of market supply, and incentive to
develop this source has to be provided or accompanied by market accessibility
and stability, as well as finance; effective market demand, however, is
generally inelastic and consequently prices react sharply to relatively small
changes in supply. The wide price spread contributes to market instability
and reduces or removes incentive to achieve sustained increases in marketed
production. This has been exacerbated by the fact that producer prices have
not been guaranteed at farm gate, and transport to market is both difficult
and expensive 1/ from most swamp and cultivated upland areas. The introduc-
tion of farm gate buying by the Corporation will go some-way to improve the
position, but will probably only directly benefit the larger farmer, since
economic and management considerations will necessitate purchases being made
on a lorry load basis, and initial collective assembly by smaller farmers
will still be necessary.
1/   It has been estimated that over 50% of farm produce is headloaded to
market. Ox and donkey carts are virtually unknown and almost the only
mechanized transport to points of assembly is the "poda-poda," usually
a pick-up adapted to carry passengers, in which people and freight are
charged at the same rate.

45.       Although high internal prices for rice may be largely attributed
to operational and administrative defects within the statutory system, low
mill recovery rates are an important factor. Apart from technical defi-
ciencies in the actual milling operation, husk weight, as a percentage of
total grain weight, varies considerably between varieties, as does grain
size, which further aggravates the maximizing of achievable yields in terms
of edible grain.
46.       Rural Assembly.  The fragmented nature of production, well identi-
fied demand centers and the undeveloped state of rural transport combine to
exert a strong influence on the market structure and systems. Marketing
practices are also biased as a result of traditional credit operations which
require repayment in kind rather than cash.
47.       Most of the first assembly process occurs at village level, with
farmers bringing in head loads of rice to a local trader who may buy either
on his own account or as agent for a larger trader or wholesaler. There is
little competition at this level and transportation constraints often result
in forced sales. Possibly because of this, the farmer-trader is becoming
more common in the surplus producing areas, although the extent of activity
varies considerably. This may range from simple transport of husk rice to
a main market center, such as Makeni, for sale., through to the complete
operation of parboiling, transporting to mill for custom milling and there-
after transport of milled rice to a demand center such as Kono or Kailahun
for sale to retailers.
48.       The merchanting sector of the rice trade revolves around the
milling operation and most large wholesaler/dealers will own, or have prefer-
ential access to, at least one mill. The mill buildings also afford some
storage facility, but it appears that most storage occurs at farm level, as
would be expected in this type of environment. Nevertheless storage does
not appear to be a trade constraint although losses may account for over
10% of the crop.
49.       Rice dealers have to be licensed, but this appears to be honoured
more in the breach than the observance and in practise seems to be confined
to the 450 larger and full time dealers. Dealers at wholesale level probably
total 1,000, a large number relative to probable volume of trade, but indi-
cative of lack of market transparence; this in turn necessitates a large
amount of individual participation, with consequent effects on marketing
costs and margins.
50.       The physical and infrastructural factors which influence the system
make general conclusions unusually dangerous to apply to specific circums-
tances, however two surveys, 1/ one of which is devoted to the Makeni area,

reveal a reasonable correlation between market centers and conclude that the
marketing system adequately reflects supply and demand conditions, at least
at local level. It does not necessarily follow, however, that there is no
room for improvement: conditions at the first assembly stage leave much to
be desired, particularly in so far as competition is concerned. At the other
end of the scale there is room and need for considerable improvement in the
regularity, availability and distribution of supplies through the Corporation
if the market balancing function is to be properly fulfilled and production
incentives maintained. The difficulties of the Corporation are compounded
by a lack of production and market information. The planned greater staff
activity in the field should result in an improvement in quantity and quality
of available intelligence; but the need for crop and market information is
not confined to rice, and reconsideration of organizational and functional
requirements in statutory marketing should include the examination of ways
and means of providing essential information to all levels in the agricul-
tural sector.
51.       Marketing and market planning problems are increased by the
apparently uneven pattern of consumption between seasons. It has been
estimated 1/ that relative consumption on a quarterly basis starting imme-
diately post harvest is in the proportions 4:3:2:1; these figures may be
correct as a national average, although they imply a remarkable elasticity
of consumption, but cannot be used on a regional basis since almost equal
accessibility to other acceptable food supplies is also implicit. While
considerable acreages of alternative food crops have been observed and
recorded in the north, particularly round Makeni, this is not the case in
the east.
Rice Milling
52.       It has been estimated that an average white rice recovery of
about 53% by weight is achieved by the small mills in the private sector,
while around 63% is recovered in the larger Corporation owned mills. The
small mills remove husk and bran in one or, very occasionally, two passes
and are simple, rugged and generally abused. Although better recoveries may
be expected from mills fitted with rubber covered shellers, the present low
rates are directly attributable to the manner in which milling is carried out
rather than to shortcomings in Engelbert type mills which, when properly used,
can produce 63-68% outturns, depending on rice variety.
53.       Recommendations for the modernization and improvement of the mill-
ing industry, including training requirements are now being considered
by Government; however, a great deal of work remains to be done in machinery
evaluation, as well as in assessment of necessary mill capacities and sites
1/ Rice Milling and Marketing Study.

before any large scale capital program can be embarked upon. Effects of
the continuing rapid escalation in costs of all new equipment should be
carefully weighed against the low book value of existing mills, and the
relatively low cost of rehabilitation and modification necessary to attain
the recovery rates of which this design and make of machinery is capable.
54.       Losses caused through milling inefficiency create a direct foreign
exchange cost. For example, during 1971 an average recovery rate of 65% for
the milled marketed surplus would have resulted in increased availability of
about 10,000 tons of locally produced rice, with a corresponding reduction
in imports and a saving of some Le 1.25 million on the import bill.
55.       Estimated operating costs for the sample mills which are to be
evaluated in EAP are shown in Table 9. Provision has been made for the labor
needed for a merchanting/milling operation; should activity be confined to
custom milling some small saving could be achieved. The high fixed costs
(never less than Le 4.60/ton) are due to the use of loan funds for all
capital expenditure, with repayment over 5 years. The costs should be com-
pared with current custom milling charges which vary between 204 and 404 per
bushel for which the rice owner may expect a recovery rate of around 55%.
With the new mills, providing the paddy is properly precleaned, recovery
should be not less than 65% by weight, plus 5-10% small brokens and bran
having a value of about Le 1.00 per ton of husk rice milled.
56.       Parboiled rice is almost universally preferred, and this process
certainly reduces the percentage of broken grains in a milled sample. Par-
boilding is traditionally carried out in 44 gallon drums, in which husk rice
is soaked and steamed overnight before being spread out to dry on cement or
clay pads, mats or adjacent roads. Although the simplicity of the operation
and lack of aids in determining temperature and moisture lends to a variability
in ultimate quality, there are indications that individuals can and do achieve
considerable evenness between batches.
57.       The costs of traditional parboiling have not been included in
Table 9, although they are in the estimated costs for the Corporation mill
at Kissy. A 44 gallon drum will hold 1 sack (2-1/2 bushels) of husk rice,
assuming the cycle occupies 45 minutes (load, boil, unLoad), parboiling one
ton would take about 9 hours and cost about Le 1.50 (say 44/bushel) for labor
and firewood. The method of drying naturally results in increased admixture,
particularly pieces of stone, tarmac, etc. all of which finds its way into
the mills with deleterious effects. Simple improvements in the traditional
process could be made without much capital investment and would result in a
better and more uniform product, a consideration far more important to the
miller/dealer than to an individual who pays a straight fee for custom
milling. Some suggestions are contained in the Rice Milling and Marketing
Study and experiments are planned in the ongoing EAP. Economic farmgate rice
prices are shown in Table 10.

Page 16
58.       In summary, the development of rice marketing and the rice market
is affected by:
(a) the impact of statutory activity and intention failing
to reach producers and consumers;
(b) underdevelopment of farm to market transportation and
roads;
(c) lack of competition at points of first assembly;
(d) inefficient milling which prevents recovery of full
value of the grain; and
(e) lack of crop and market information and uncertainty
over patterns of consumption.
59.       Other Food Crops (see Table 11).  A wide variety of crops are
grown and marketed; of these cassava, groundnuts, maize, millet and sweet
potato are the most important. With the exception of groundnuts, which are
moved over long distances, disposal of these crops is confined almost
entirely to local market centers. Cassava and sweet potato are probably
grown as much for the leaf as for the tuber, although consumption of the
latter increases with the 'hungry season'. Maize is the prime staple grain
for the Foulah and only unimportant surpluses find their way to market. This
tends to indicate a failure of the market to transmit consumer requirements
to producers: maize has been imported in small quantities since 1969 to meet
feed industry requirements. Groundnuts are used extensively as a food, being
prepared in a number of ways, and the oil is highly valued for cooking. Trade
occurs both on a shelled and unshelled basis, although the former method is
usually confined to retail level. All shelling is carried out by hand.
60.       Although Sierra Leone was a small net exporter of groundnuts during
the 1950's, production is now inadequate to meet local needs and a privately
owned mill at Bo is inoperative due to lack of supplies. Imports of soft oils
have averaged about 1,400 tons annually (3,100 tons groundnut equivalent) over
the past four years (Table 12). Incremental production from the project
would therefore effectively be import substitution, with an economic value
related to that of the cheapest acceptable vegetable oil (Table 13). For
practical purposes prices have been calculated on the basis of Bank projec-
tions for Nigerian groundnuts delivered Freetown, while SLPMB would be
required to guarantee a floor price equal to export parity (Table 14).

Palm Products - Markets and Prices
Palm Oil
61.       Palm oil is an important item in the national diet: present domestic
production is insufficient to meet demand and varying quantities of imports
have been recorded over the past few years (Table 12). The supply/demand
imbalance is expected to worsen during the rest of this decade, a deficit of
about 12,000 tons being projected for 1980 1/ (Table 15).
62.       Although local preference is for the red, traditionally processed
oil as opposed to the white and purer, but less tasty oil, that will be
produced by the mill at Daru; this is not likely to impose any serious
marketing constraint, however, since in a deficiency situation prime poten-
tial competition would be from imp6rted oils of similar quality to that from
Daru.
63.       Local prices are reported to exceed world levels (Table 16) although
SLPMB attempts to set a market ceiling by selling oil from its mills at 11k/lb
wholesale. This price is now (July 1974) something of an anomaly in that it
is below export parity and in fact very close to Bank projected prices through
1980 (Table 17). The 5-7% of production that is available to SLPMB is, how-
ever, insufficient, and these efforts tend to benefit traders more than con-
sumers, especially during the period when oil from traditionally processed
wild palm is in short supply.
Palm Kernels
64.       Apart from a brief period in 1968, all SLPMB palm kernel purchases
were exported unprocessed until early 1974, when rehabilitation of the
mill at Wellington allowed crushing to restart on a commercial basis. Full
capacity (30,000 tons kernels) is below present and projected purchases,
so exports of kernels as well as oil and cake are expected to continue in
the foreseeable future (Table 18).
65.       Palm kernels are purchased by LBA and delivered to store or Welling-
ton mill as directed by SLPMB; the greater part of production comes from wild
palm and marketed supply thus tend to have a considerable opportunist element.
LBA operate extensively throughout EAP and NAP, although a large proportion
of their purchases are made by sub-agents, away from nominated buying points
and at levels reported to be between 60% and 80% of official prices.
66.       Exports of palm kernels and palm kernel products from Sierra Leone
account for a very small proportion of world trade (less than 6% in 1972),
and incremental production resulting from EAP will make little difference.
Although it is possible that a small amount of oil will be needed locally
in import substitution, the crop, and thus pricing policy, will continue to
be export oriented. Economic and financial millgate prices are therefore
calculated on this basis using current marketing charges and taxation policies
(Table 19).

E. Marketing and the Projects
67.       Various studies already referred to indicate satisfactory market
performance for short term changes in supply/demand relationships but not
for longer term needs or interseasonal stability. Although a proportion of
the present difficulties is due to inadequacies within MANR as well as the
absence of institutional credit, official pricing policies and organizational
and operational failures among statutory bodies are as much to blame. The
projects would seek to:
(i) create or restore confidence in the market and the system;
(ii) provide a sound basis for-field operations by the official
marketing organizations;
(iii)  provide assistance in the development of overall marketing
policies, organization and practice;
(iv) provide a mechanism through which may be demonstrated the
relationships between the various commercial aspects of
agriculture (inputs, credit and marketing), and provide
a basis for effective management and sound development
thereof.
68.       A series of market areas would be created, each embracing a number
of development areas. Each market area would have a market center which
would become the focal point for commercial activity in that area.
69.       Each market center would consist of a store of about 8,000 ft3
together with necessary offices in a fenced one to two acre area. For
maximum economy modular design and building systems would be adopted and
offices would be built on the lean-to principle. Facilities, including
scales would be provided for statutory marketing operations to ensure active
competition and proper performance by LBA and the private sector. Represen-
tatives from both SLPMB and the Corporation would not be necessary for this
function which could be efficiently carried out by a single buying team. The
objective is to stimulate, not suffocate, local commercial activity, while
providing the farmer with readier access to a guaranteed minimum price structure.
70.       The performance of LBA has appeared to be reasonably satisfactory
despite the absence of any regular reporting and control system. It is not
envisaged that direct project participation in marketing would be necessary;
however there would be advantages if the project becomes an LBA, not for
buying produce, but to permit the appointment of farmer groups as sub-agents,
and project staff to carry out an audit and training function.
71.       If circumstances warrant, facilities would be made available at
market centers for produce assembly by farmers engaging in group marketing
activities, but these would be on a strictly short term basis and terminal



Volume 1
Annex 2
Page 19
storage facilities would not be provided. Produce Inspectors would also be
able to work at and from the centers which would also become a collection
and dissemination point for crop and market intelligence.
F. Future Development
72.       Some problem areas are discussed in Section C (paras 25 through
35). Corrective action and improvement of marketing deficiencies must occur
if the very modest growth rate projected for the sector 1/ is to be achieved.
Work is being carried out on some aspects of marketing, particularly export
crop pricing, by MANR; however, many of the possible and badly needed benefits
are likely to be lost or wasted because it is being tackled in isolation.
73.       Sierra Leone has a large proportion of its agricultural wealth in
high value tree crops which require little marketing infrastructure. This
provides opportunity for high tax imposition without compensatory benefits to
the agricultural sector as a whole; low producer prices reflect not only heavy
taxation and undue capital acquisition by SLPMB, but also high costs of primary
marketing.
74.       Difficulties of balance between annual and perennial crops occur,
exacerbated by a naturally accelerating growth of market dependent population
and the move away from subsistence agriculture. The failure of perennial crop
marketing policies to help stimulate food crop production has been compounded
by effective consumer subsidies (through imported rice sales) that the further
hindered the development of incentives for increasing food production.
75.       The statutory marketing organizations operating under this unsatis-
factory situation are victims of their origins and circumstances. The effect
of past failures has led to change being feared, with consequently little
attempt being made to anticipate how future marketing needs and demands may
be met. Price manipulation and the largely perennial nature of gazetted crops
has allowed this lack of enterprise to be obscured in the case of SLPMB, while
the rather different and difficult circumstances of the Rice Corporation have
not encouraged or allowed the implementation of meaningful policies.
76.       Marketing policies and practices must encourage agricultural develop-
ment. In the case of the prime export commodities, Sierra Leone production is
too small to influence the market. Every effort must be made to offset the
disadvantages of being a market follower by introducing systems which will
allow a greater share of consumer expenditure to reach the farmets.

77.       In this respect the recent diversion of palm kernel oil and cake
marketing away from SLPMC is unfortunate. Sierra Leone export market partici-
pation is small, a good national image has been created by single channel
export marketing and overheads have been kept within reasonable limits. Excision
of responsibility for one crop can only increase the proportional expenses for
other crops. Mill rehabilitation and production management was essential to
the development of a sound palm kernel oil marketing policy, but is an in
adequate basis for fragmentation of the marketing operation.

Characteristics
The machine consists of a husking chamber, aspirator section and
million chamber. Hulling is accomplished by a pair of rubber covered rollers;
these are separate discharge outlets for milled rice, bran, husks.
Method
Upgraded upland rice was parboiled (soaked for 8 hours, boiled with
steam at 100 lab/in2) and dried 1/. After storing for 3 days the grain was
weighed into mill hoppers.
Result
Rated capacity = 1,100 lbs husk rice/hour
Equivalent per ton
Husk rice input            1,200 lbs                 2,240 lbs

Recovery Rates
White rice                 74.1%
Bran                        5.6%
Remarks
High temperature of rice after milling resulted in tendency for
bran to stick to the rice, which was consequently of very mixed appearance.
Bran also tends to clog perforated screen in milling chamber, reducing through-
put and causing irregular whiteness. Means need to be found to improve
aspiration and reduce temperatures'.

INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II
Organization and Staffing
A. Organization
General
1.        The Eastern and Northern Projects, occupying a combined gross area
of 3,960 sq. miles, represents nearly 15% of the gross land area of Sierra
Leone. Together they will provide a major impact on the agricultural sector
and the relationship between project management and existing administrative
and institutional services is very important.
Central Administration
2.        Each project will be managed by separate Project Management Units
(PMU's). The EAPMU is already established and located at Kenema and the
NAPMU will be established and located at Makeni. The PMU's form part of
the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR) and will report
directly to the Permanent Secretary of Agriculture. A Project Evaluation
and Services Unit would be established at MANR Freetown to provide operational
and financial support to the projects and to evaluate ongoing projects.
3.        The Project Evaluation and Services Unit would be established within
MANR in Freetown and would be responsible for providing operational service
support, financial control and guidance to Bank and other externally financed
agricultural projects. The unit would include:
(a) a Financial Controller, who would head PESU, responsible for all
project accounting matters, financial coordination and control,
and internal audit;
(b) a Commercial Services Officer, responsible for sales systems
and policy, farm credit supervision, institutional develop-
ment, and coordination of project marketing with the Govern-
ment marketing institutions; and
(c) a Projects Economist, responsible for evaluation of ongoing projects
and evaluation of proposed projects formulated by the planning
staff of the MANR technical divisions.
The organizational arrangements for MANR are shown in Chart 1.



Volume 1
Annex 3
Page 2
4.        The Project Advisory Committee (PAC), already established under
the Eastern Area Project, would play an active role in technical and policy
decisions. The Committee would ensure coordination between projects, other
Divisions of MANR, and related Government Departments and service institu-
tions.
5.        Local Administration.  At the regional level, the projects would
operate as autonomous units but would maintain a close and formalized rela-
tionship with local departments and institutions.  The latter would be achieved
through Project and Chiefdom Planning Committees which would be essential
both for successful project implementation and for the gradual transition of
management responsibilities.
6.        The Project Management Units (see schedule 3 and 4 of this Annex)
would each consist of five sections covering Extension and Training, Conserva-
tion and Land Development, Administration, Finance, and Commercial Services.
The Extension and Training Section would be responsible for introducing manage-
ment and technical services to farmers through intensive extension effort
supported by applied research, improved seed, and staff and farmer training
facilities. The Conservation and Land Development Section would be responsible
for planning project development strategies, data collection and land use
planning, and directing all land development and civil works programs. The
Administration and Finance Sections would provide full supporting services
for the project, covering transport, personnel, public relations, procurement
and accounts.
7.        The Commercial Services Section would be primarily concerned with
procurement and distribution of farm inputs, but represents an important
change in concept. The unit would operate commercially and the objective
would be to sell farm inputs for cash or credit. The unit would operate on
a pricing structure which would include direct investment and distribution
costs and would encourage optimum farmer participation in distribution through
price incentives for bulk purchases and collection. Grouping of farmers into
production units with economies of scale would be actively encouraged by the
production department in close coordination with the Chiefdom authorities
which are sufficiently strong and respected to supply the necessary disciplines
for group responsibility. The Commercial Service Sections would be managed at
project level by Sierra Leoneans with suitable business acumen, but would
be assisted by the Project Evaluation and Services Unit in Freetown. Credit
Services would be ancillary to the input supply network, and while in NAP
initially operating as a project financed and controlled credit fund, the
intention would be to transfer the established credit fund to an independent
Farmers' Finance Company (FFC). For the Eastern Area Project, such developments
are already underway and are discussed in more detail in Volume 3 Annex 4
Appendix I.
8.        Project Coordinating Committees would be established in each project
to coordinate development with local departments and institutions and to allow
participation of farmers and traditional leaders in the planning process. At



Volume 1
Annex 3
Page 3
the project level, a Project Coordinating Committee (PCC) chaired by the Provin-
cial Secretary, and represented by the Provincial Agricultural Officer, Local
Government, Public Works, Education, Health, and Paramount Chiefdoms, would
convene quarterly. In the Northern Area Project, the committee would also be
represented by the Rokel Leaf Tobacco Company subsidiary of the Aureol Tobacco
Company which would be closely associated with the NAP Production Department
in all aspects of tobacco extension. At the Chiefdom and village levels, the
projects would operate through committees of traditional leaders and elected
farmers representatives.
9.        Administrative Transitions.  Project organization has been influenced
by two important objectives, namely that in future commercial services would
be able to operate without Government financing, and that the remaining proj-
ect services would revert as quickly as possible to Government. A major
objective of both projects is to encourage institutional development in
parallel with agricultural development so that progress becomes self perpetuat-
ing. For the Eastern Area Project, proposals for establishing an Oil Palm
Company at Daru, and a Farmer Finance Company at Kenema are already under
consideration. A similar finance company could be established at Makeni at
some time in the future.
10.       Farm input supply procedures would follow strictly commercial lines
and although pricing structures would reflect direct investment and distri-
bution costs, the Commercial Services Section would be subsidized initially
to cover salaries and transport costs of sales agents, who would supervize
and service all cash and credit sales. However during project implementation
four significant developments would take place:
(a) farmers would become experienced in important aspects of
crop husbandry thereby reducing their dependence on the
technical services of sales agents and extension staff;
(b) grouping of farmers would be encouraged by the extension
staff to allow economies of scale in the distribution network;
(c) group development would be intimately associated with the
chiefdom authorities which are strong and respected, and
would provide the necessary disciplines to ensure group
responsibility for debts;
(d) training programs in crop husbandry and development would
be established for chiefdom agents for employment by
chiefdom authorities as group instructors (training programs
of this sort are already underway at Kenema).
11.       These developments, which from experience obtained under the on-
going Eastern Area Project are believed to be realistic, would allow marked
staff and overall cost reductions. While development in the Northern Area



Volume 1
Annex 3
Page 4
Project is likely to be slower and more difficult due to the conditions of
the area (see Volume 2), at Kenema it is expected that by 1978, progress
would be such as to allow a farm supply company to be established, either
independently, or as a subsidiary of the farmer finance company.
12.       While the primary aim is to achieve sustained improvement through
institutional development, a Government sponsored extension service would
have an essential role to play in disseminating research findings, and
extending development into aspects and areas not covered by the existing
projects. From the outset, the Provincial Agricultural Officer (PAO) for the
Northern Province would be involved in project development planning through
the Project Advisory Committee, and ultimately would take over all activities
scheduled for continued Government administration. For the Eastern Area Pro-
ject a special Senior Agricultural officer would be responsible to the Project
Manager for the direction and control of all non-project actions within 1/ and
outside the project area.
13.       The organizational arrangements for the Project Management Units are
shown in Charts 2 and 3.
B. Staffing
14.       Details of staff numbers required for the projects are given at
Tables 1 through 3, and job descriptions for senior positions are detailed
at Schedule 4.
15.       All provincial agricultural staff currently working in the project
areas, except those directly involved in the mechanized farming program, would
be transferred to the projects. This would amount to 20 additional field
assistants for the NAP and 15 for the EAP. Agricultural Officer (degree)
staff and Field Assistants (certificate) staff are currently trained at
Njala University and information regarding the future MANR supply and demand
situation is uncertain. There are currently a number of agricultural develop-
ment proposals (other than the Eastern and Northern Projects) being considered
by Government which if implemented, could cause a serious manpower deficit.
However, assuming that implementation of other projects during the disburse-
ment period is low, staff demands of the proposed Bank projects would be only
marginally in excess of the expected outturn from Njala. In addition, Govern-
ment is currently considering proposals for a new training program to be
fLnanced under UK bilateral assistance with a scheduled outturn of 150 trained
agriculturalists per annum. In the case of both degree and certificate staff,
neither project is expected to face serious recruitment problems.
