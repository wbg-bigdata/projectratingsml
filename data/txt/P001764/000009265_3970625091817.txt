MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE
FOR AN ENERGY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.             The following report on a proposed development credit to
Mozambique for SDR 15.6 million (US$20 million equivalent) is submitted for
approval.   The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms and help
finance an Energy Technical Assistance and Rehabilitation Project.
Onlending of US$8.7 million to the National Petroleum Supply CDmpany
(PETROMOC) would be as follows:   US$5.0 million for  the purchase  of
equipment, spare parts, and vehicles at 110X of the Bank loan rate, and
US$3.7 million for technical assistance at an annual fee of 1.75%.
Onlending of a of US$9.6 million to the Electricity Company of Mozambique
(EDM) would be as follows: US$4.5 million for the purchase of equipment,
spare parts and vehicles at the Bank loan rate, and US$5.1 million for
technical assistance at an annual fee of 1.75%.  EDM and PETROMOC would
carry the foreign exchange risk.   The balance of US$1.7 million would be
for technical assistance to the Ministry of Industry and Energy (MIE) and
the National Hydrocarbons  Company  (ENH).   A grant of US$5.0 million
equivalent is being provided by the Government of Norway as cofinancing for
the project.
2.            Background.  Mozambique has substantial hydropower and coal
resources and reasonable hydrocarbons potential. Present annual per capita
consumption of energy is about 250 kilograms of oil equivalent, which is
low by regional standards. 80% of this consumption is from woodfuels. MIE
is responsible for implementing energy policies and for the performance of
EDM and PETROMOC.   The Department of Energy (DOE) in MIE provides advice
and coordination on policy and sector development. The Ministry of Mineral
Resources is responsible for the performance of ENH in petroleum and gas
exploration and development and the National Coal Company (CARBOMOC) for
coal production.   The Ministry of Agriculture is involved in woodfuel
matters through its Directorate of Forestry.
3.        Institutional development of the energy sector organizations has
been hindered by the country's economic difficulties since Independence,
particularly by shortages  of  trained  staff  and foreign exchange.,  and
disruptions  to  operations  by  the  activities  of  armed  bands.    The
organizations share common institutional and management problems:   (a)
inadequate financial data and lack of auditing; (b) minimal planning and
budgeting; and (c) little or no technical and management training.  EDM and
PETROMOC have not produced reliable financial accounts for many years.
These problems are explicitly addressed in the proposed project. EDM's and
PETROMOC's physical facilities have deteriorated due mainly to shortages of
transport and maintenance equipment, materials, spare parts and skilled
manpower. Frequent power outages and unreliable petroleum supplies result
in lost industrial production and agroindustrial  exports.   The safety
standards of PETROMOC's fuel handling facilities are below acceptable
limits. The proposed project also addresses these issues.



- 2 -
4.            The Bank's recent energy sector report 1/ has helped the
Government to identify a five-year investment program with the following
priorities:   (a) to increase the reliability of energy supplies; (b) to
increase the availability of woodfuels, kerosene and electricity to urban
households; (c) to strengthen the institutional capabilities of the energy
supply agencies; (d) to prepare sound least-cost investment programs with
emphasis on rehabilitation; and (e) to establish priorities among proposed
large export-oriented projects based on indigenous energy resources. These
priorities are consistent with Government's current comprehensive reform of
economic policies under which enterprises are now able to offer competitive
wages and incentives to retain and motivate skilled personnel, and to set
prices to cover costs.   Electricity tariffs and petroleum product prices
were increased to compensate fully for the five-fold devaluation of the
metical announced on January 30, 1987.  Until completion of the financial
accounts for EDM and PETROMOC by project-funded consultants, the financial
adequacy of these prices remains in question, although price levels are
reasonably in line with economic costs.
5.            Projec-t 2bjectives.  The project is designed to bring about
quickly a substantial improvement in the supply and distribution of
electricity and petroleum products to the main urban areas, especially
Maputo, Beira, Nampula, Nacala and Quelimane, where most of the the
country's trade and processing activities are carried out, through
rehabilitation   of   facilities   and   strengthening  of  the  relevant
institutions.   A second objective is to support economic recovery beyond
the short-cerm by helping the energy agencies to prepare sound long-term
development plans.
6.               Project Description.    The proposed project would  (a)
rehabilitate EDM's and PETROMOC's physical facilities and provide vehicles
and special-purpose maintenance and distribution equipment; (b) provide
operational support  to EDM and  PETROMOC for three years  in managing
transport fleets and operating power and petroleum handling facilities; and
(c) provide technical assistance to EDM, PETROMOC, MIE and ENH to design
and implement management and financial systems, for manpower training and
to prepare subsector development plans for power, petroleum and household
energy. The project would be coordinated by the MIE and executed by EDM,
PETROMOC and ENH.   These agencies already have experience in managing
advisers and consulting organizations. The total estimated project cost is
US$30.4 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$25.0
million (82%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A.  Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.   A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Mozambique are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.  A map is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6647-MOZ dated May 1, 1987, is
also attached.   A Project Preparation Facility of US$1.1 million has been
approved to finance advance procurement assistance,preparation of financial
statements for EDM and PETROMOC and the initial foreign exchange costs of
operational support to EDM and PETROMOC.
7.              Rationale for IDA Involvement.    The Bank's strategy in
Mozambique is to support the Government's efforts to improve economic
policies, strengthen institutions responsible for the planning and
1/  'Mozambique:  Issues and Options in the Energy Sector', January 1987;
Joint UNDP/World Bank Energy Assessment Program.



-3-
management of key economic sectors, and to rehabilitate services and
activities essential to the recovery and development of the economy.   In
this context, the project would: (a) support the Government in implementing
its energy sector strategy as discussed in the energy sector report,
particularly to strengthen operations and management; (b) contribute IDA's
experience on rehabilitation, institutional strengthening and sector
development; and (c) mobilize and focus donor assistance on immediate
rehabilitation and institutional strengthening priorities.
t             8.            Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following
actions: (i) EDM and PETROMOC would fund at least 20% of their investment
programs from net income after debt servicing in FY89, and at least 30%
from FY90; (ii) the Borrower would maintain retail prices of petroleum
products at least equal to the sum of the prevailing levels of import
parity prices, inland distribution costs and overheads; (iii) EDM and
PETROMOC would not incur debt which would reduce below 1.5 the ratio of net
revenues to debt service requirements; (iv) EDM and PETROMOC would
implement by December 31, 1987, compensation packages to retain skilled
manpower; (v) Government would not undertake energy investments which are
outside the agreed five-year energy investment program and which exceed
US$3.0 million without prior consultation with IDA, and would exchange
views with IDA on the energy sector investment program following
project-funded studies; (vi) EDM and PETROMOC would  keep a register of
vehicles provided under the project; (vii) EDM and PETROMOC would present
income statements for FY85 and FY86 and financial plans for FY87 and FY88
as a condition of disbursement on the components for maintenance and
rehabilitation of power and petroleum supply facilities and supply of
vehicles  to EDM and  PETROMOC;  and  (viii)  as  a  condition  of  credit
effectiveness, the Association would require (a) signature of contracts for
assistance in preparing financial statements for EDM and PETROMOC; (b)
effectiveness of the Norwegian Grant Agreements; and (c) Government to
conclude subsidiary loan agreements with EDM and PETROMOC.
9.         Justification.  Economic benefits from the proposed project are
expected from improving energy supplies to key economic consumers by
rehabilitating operating facilities and strengthening sector institutions.
The estimated economic rate of return is 27%.
10.         Risks.  The main risk would be delay in project implementation
from insufficient management resources in 9DM and PETROMOC.   This risk
would be diminished by the project's operational and management support
components.   The project activities would be coacentrated in areas which
have been relatively free from the activities of armed bands.
11.         Recommendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
