PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
1.       This is  a  project  completion  report  (PCR)  for the Vocational
Training and Technological DevelopmenLt Project in Uruguay (Loan 1594-UR),
for which a loan of US$9.7 million was approved in June 1978. The original
closing date of June 30, 1983 was extended until June 30, 1986, and the
final disbursement was made April 24, 1987.
2.       The completion report was  prepared  by  the Latin America and the
Caribbean Regional Office following a mission to Uruguay (December 1-12,
1986)1/ and based on:
(a) completion reports prepared by both COCAP and LAiTU which are
attached herewith as Appendices A and B;
(b) the Bank's files related to the project, including the Board
Resolution, Loan Agreement and the Appraisal Report No. 1928b-
UR (dated May 25, 1978; and
(c) the findings of the mission.
3.       The Bank acknowlehdges  the  preparation  of  completion reports by
each of the implementing agencies, and therefore has limited its contribu-
tion to an Overview and a section on Conclusions and Lessons Learned. The
details on project execution are in Appendices A and B.
4.       In accordance with the  revised procedures for project performance
veporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
but the project was not audited by  OED  staff.   The draft PCR was sent to
the Borrower and its agencies for comuents in March 1988. No comments were
received.
1/  The  completion  mission   (December   1-12,  1986)  comprised  Messrs.
J. St. Germain (Architect, LCPED) and W. Hobbs (Technical Educator-
Consultant).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
URUGUAY
VOCATIONAL TRAINING AND
TECHNOLI)GICAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1594-UR)
EVALUAT.ION SUMMARY
Introduction
This project addressed the manpower and technology needs of an
export-oriented industrial development strategy elucidated by the Borrower in
the middle 1970s. It was prepared and appraised in 1977 and approved in June
1978. A Loan of US$9.7 million equivalent was provided for a project whose
total costs were estimated at US$16.5 million equivalent. The project closed
three years after originally envisaged, on June 30, 1986, and cost US$22.3
million equivalent, an overrun of 36Z.
ObJectives and Project Content
The manpower and technology development aspects were designed to be
implemented as separate components. The Vocational Training component sought
to upgrade the skill level of the labor force by establishing a natlonal
vocational training system under the direction of the newly-established
Vocational  Training   Council  (COCAP),   which would   also  serve  as  the
implementing agency for the component.   The  project  financed  the  costs of
constructing and equipping a training center, procuring mobile training units,
building up the human capital to support the system and undertaking surveys to
determine inservice training needs (paras. 1.2, 1.3).
The Technological D 'elopment component was to be implemented by the
Technological Laboratory of UN ',uay (LATU) and was designed to strengthen
LATU's capacity to undertake research, disseminate information and assist
entrepreneurs in developing new production technologies.   Bank  financing was
to provide technical assistance and equip laboratories in new facilities whose
construction would be financed out of LATU's reserves (pars. 1.4).
Implementation Experience
Severe start up problems plagued both components and so delayed
disbursements  that   by  1982,  the  intended  year  of  completion,  overall
disbursement levels were only 4% of  estimates.   Implementation of  the COCAP
component lagged because the Government initially delayed enacting the legal,
legislative,  and  financial  measures   necessary  to   establish  COCAP  and



- vii -
subsequently neglected to provide COCAP with adequate funding. Long delays,
rising costs and undependable budgetary allocations prevented COCAP from
retaining staff on a full time basis (including instructors), hampered the
effective use of technical assistance, and led to the abandourment of the plan
to construct  a new  facility.   It would  appear that  negative outcomes were
serendipitously and creatively averted by renovating an existing building and
employing industrially-qualified instructors on an ad hoc basis. The delays
even allowed the introduction of changer to the training programs  as a result
of the manpower training needs studies. The net result was successful, as the
dimensions of the renovated facilities compared ravorably with original
expectations and were provided at a significantly reduced cost. The final
cost of the component was US$2.23 million, compared with US$4.92 million
foreseen at Appraisal (para. 1.6).
The LATU component faced start up problems resulting from internal
disagreements over the use of the LATU-owned site and the inadequacy of the
original  architectural  designs.    Bank  supervision  missions did not fully
appreciate the highly technical aspects of LATU activities and contributed to
delays by withholding approval of building designs and materials procurement
in a futile attempt to force questionable changes in the LATU-financed
construction.   Such difficulties were eventually resolved as the Bank came to
a better understanding of  the needs  of such  a component.   The  size of the
facility eventually constructed exceeded Appraisal estimates by 168Z, while
the total cost was US$18.1 million, as compared with US$11.5 million estimated
at Appraisal (para. 1.06).
Results
Problematic   implementation   notwithstandir.g,   the   project  was
completed without apparent compromise to most of its objectives, and the
groundwork has been laid for COCAP and LATU to have a positive and durable
impact.  Despite  reduced  staffing  and  _. ..etary  provisions  and continued
absence of long term financing arrangements, COCAP was established and has
made progress in developing a training system for upgrading employed workers,
using borrowed premises before project-financed facilities became available.
The mobile training units were operating at an acceptable level and in-service
training programs were organized around industry lemand. The fact that the
recurrent costs of these preliminary courses--including instructor salaries--
have been met entirely from collected training fees demonstrates initial
interest in the services COCAP provides and bodes well for the future (paras.
1.7, 1.8, 2.1, and 2.3).
The objective of improving LATU's capability has been met, and that
of expanding its activities will be fully met when the facilities are
complete.   In the event, the decision during implementation to build a single
facility rather than splitting it into two locations as envisaged at Appraisal
was a wise one, encouraging efficiency and avoiding duplication of recurrent
costs. Delays in opening the new complex contributed to the underutilization
of Bank-financed technical assistance, but without apparent negative impact on
project outcomes given the alternative provisions for technical assistance
(paras. 1.7, 1.8 , 2.2, and 2.3).

Sustainability
The sustainability of benefits generated by this project is more
closely linked to the health of the economy than in most education projects,
because utilization of the services developed will depend ultimately on their
perceived contribution toward growth in the industrial and agricultural
sectors.   From this  perspective, the  resilience of  the vocational training
approach supported under the project in the face of serious start-up problems
and still-unresolved financing issues is encouraging, as is the interest
already expressed by employers in the preliminary courses offered by COCAP.
As an established and proven institution, supported by both public and private
sectors, LATU already had a leading edge.   Manufacturers have  indicated that
the technical assistance provided under the Loan and through LATU has led to
improved production methods.   Pending LATU's  ability to  effectively utilize
its expanded capacity and the outcomes of other elements in the export
capacity development program, prospects for sustainability are generally good.
Findinzs and Lessons
Despite their common purpose in supporting industrial development,
the separation of the project into two components implemented independently
by each beneficiary agency was a wise decision, particularly in light of the
subsequenc--if  totally   unrelated--implementation  problems  experienced  by
each. Such arrangements allowed for problems to be addressed and eventually
resolved in the appropriate context.
Most  problems  stemmed  from weal  technical preparation or design
flaws which were exacerbated in some instances by lack of government momentum
or inadequate/inappropriate supervision. In the COCAP component, the need to
enact vital legislation prior to project start up was not recognized, and the
absence of long term financing arrangements still has the potential for
undermining the long term impact of COCAP. The LATU component, an innovative
technology development effort, suffered from the Bank's unfamiliarity with
this type of  institution  and  its  needs.    The  special  architectural and
engineering expertise required to set up the f%cilities was insufficiently
considered  and  the  technical  assistance  was  ill-timed.    Highly complex
technological components should be scrutinized during preparation to determine
supervision needs and to decide the relative involvement of the education and
industry divisions.   The  experience also highlights the problems of projects
where the Bank chooses to finance equipment and technical assistance but not
civil works, and supports observations in other Project Completion Reports
regarding the advisability of this practice /1 (para. 2.4).

VOCATIONAL TRAINING AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1594-UR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
OVERVIEW
Proiect Generation and Content
1.1      The project was prepared  in  1977  through the combined efforts of
Government and private institutions coordinated by SEPLACODI officials with
the assistence from the World  Bank,  and was appraised in September/October
1977 (Appraisal Report  No.  1928b-UR  of  May  25,  1978).   The loan (Loan
1594-UR) provided US$9.7 million out of an estimated project cost of US$16.5
million equivalent.    The  final  total  cost  of  the  project was US$22.3
million; an increase of US$5.8  million  or  35%.   It consisted of a US$2.9
million decrease in the COCAP component and a US$8.7 million increase in the
LATU component. However, the connotations of both these changes are largely
positive. COCAP's decrease was due to (a) their obtaining an existing
structurally sound building and extensively renovating it at a cost savings
of US$1.2 million, (b) to a US$0.3 million savings in the cost of the
training needs study, and (c) to a UT$1.4 million reduction in the T. A.
package. LATU's overrun was due principally to a US$7.7 million (216%)
increase in civil works costs as a result of 168% increase in space. This
increased space is enabling the institution to move all laboratories, pilot
plants and administration into the new facility, thus resulting in higher
efficiency and quality of their technological services to industry. Local
funds were made available through very substantial increases in the local
purchasing power of LATU's accumulated reserves, which were held largely in
US dollars and in foreign grants (about US$2.2 million).
1.2      The project was designed in two parts.  A particular feature of the
project is the complete separation of the two components in implementation
terms, COCAP and LATU, up to the closing of the project. In the appraisal
report there are two separate appraisal sections, and two separate costs,
disbursement and implementation tables; during implementation, separate
reports were written for each component most of the time. COCAP and LATU
have also each written good separate completion reports which were of great
assistance to the mission. They are included as Appendices A and B.
1.3      The  Vocational  Training  component  (COCAP)  was  to  assist  the
Government of Uruguay in establishing a national vocational training system
providing upgrading training for employed manpower essential to the imple-
mentation of its economic  development  strategy.    This  was to be done by
assisting in the construction, furnishing and equipping of a new vocational
training center, purchasing six mobile training units and providing almost
ten years of specialist services.   In addition, the component financed sur-
veys to determine current and medium-term inservice training needs, and to
assist the new vocational Training Council (COCAP) to develop its opera-
tional capability.
1.4      The Technological Development  component  (LATU)  was to assist the
Government of Uruguay in improving and expanding its domestic capability in
the areas of technological research, dissemination of information and



- 2 -
technical assistance to entrepreneurs in support of its export oriented
industrial development  strategy.    LATU,  the  Technological Laboratory of
Uruguay was to be assisted in the construction (financed entirely from
LATU's own earnings) furnishings and the purchase and installations of the
mechanical and electrical equipment for eleven additional laboratories and
pilot plants.
1.5      On May 21, 1984 a  change  in  the  loan agreement was signed which
changed Part A of Schedule two to enable %.OCAP to renovate an existing
building rather than construct  a  new  one  as  planned.   There was also a
change in the percentage of Bank financing of civil works from 252 to 60x.
1.6      Project implementation which lasted 8.5  years (3.5 years more than
originally estimated suff- ed from many reasons (as fully described in the
appendices) and hereinafter summarized:
(a) COCAP (Appendix A para. 2.1)
(i) The regulations establishing COCAP were signed three years
after loan signing.
(ii)  From 1978 to  1982,  the  institution  had  no budget, the
director was located in a borrowed office, and there were
no other regular  staff.    Furthermore, serious delays in
the amounts and dates of receipt continued to exist up to
the time of loan closing.
(b) LATU (Appendix B, para. 2.01, 2.06, 2.11-2.12)
(i) The start of the project was delayed for three years by
the Government, apparently because of disagreements on the
use of the LATU owned site.
(ii)  The plans were changed  twice  because of the inability of
the original architect to prepar, an acceptable design
(the architect was changed subsequently).
(iii)   The Bank delayed the approval  of plans and procurement of
materials for approximately one year in a futile attempt
to  force   questionable   changes   in   LATU's  financed
construction.
(iv) Strikes and delayed delivery of materials plagued the
implementation of the component.
1.7      The experience of this project underscores the following points.
Proiect Generation Stage
(a)  A  project  component   requiring   enabling  regulations  (or
legislation), such as COCAP, should not be included in the
plroject unless the draft legislation is submitted to the Bank
by project negotiations or, at the very latest, by Board
approval. Final Government approval of the legislation could
be a disbursement condition for the component, or the object
of a dated covenant; and



(b) Serious thought must be given to any project where new civil
works are financed by the Government (such as in LATU) and the
Bank  finances   only   furniture,   equipment  and  technical
assistance. In this method of financing the Bank has a weak
influence over the implementation of the civil works with
resulting loss of control of other elements of the project
(Appendix B, para.  5.04).    Another  alternative would be to
make the loan only when constructions are well advanced. In
this case the financial assistance should have been provided
at a later date.   In  so  doing the disbursement period could
have been shortened, extension of the closing date might have
been avoided, and high counterpart fund requirements toward
the later stages of project implementation could have been
avoided.
1.8      Implementation
(a) Civil Works: The design of civil works and mechanical systems
for the LATU technological facility caused serious delays. It
is important that they be designed by competent architects and
consulting engineers who have experience in this type of
facility, prior to Board  presentation.   Invariably this will
require significant participation of process engineering firms
at the inception of the project, possibly through Technical
Assistance.
(b) Splitting a technological institute (LATU) into two widely
separated locations as envisioned in the appraisal report,
results in duplication of support services, decreased effi-
ciency and thus higher recurrent costs. The decision of LATU
to build the complete center at one site, even though delaying
implementation, will result in major increases in efficiencies
at reduced cost (Appendix B, Highlights).
(c) Obtaining and altering suitable existing buildings can be very
economical and represents a way to speed up implementation
(Appendix A, para. 8); but existing buildings should be
carefully surveyed.
(d)  Technical Assistance:   When  technical  assistance by foreign
experts (for LATU) is dependent upon a facility to be com-
pleted, its implementation should be carefully planned so as
to avoid wastage and inefficiencies. It should be planned for
the phase of project implementation in which all constructions
are completed to allow their full utilization by the local and
foreign experts.
(e) The mobile training units are operating at an acceptable
level, and allow a good decentralization of training efforts.
(f) COCAP has been able to meet the demand of industry to upgrade
manpower and trainers.    All  inservice training programs are
organized with industries and, thus, are very efficient and
relevant.
(g) Covenants: All loan covenants for components have been com-
plied with, though several with long delays (Annexes 2 and 3).



(h)  Financing:   All  recurrent  costs  of  all  training courses,
including instructor costs in COCAP, have been paid entirely
from collected training fees (Appendix A, para. 5.2).
(i)  Staffing:  Due to budgetary restrictions, the most detrimental
decision in the COCAP component was to put the newly appointed
director on a one-half time basis for practically the whole
implementation period until April 1, 1986, and appoint all
personnel on the same basis (Appendix A, para. 1.7).
(j)  Budgetary restrictions required COCAP  to contract ad hoc part
time  instructors.    These  were  technically  qualified  and
industrially experienced people from industries, and proved so
successful that this is now the standard procedure for COCAP.
These part-time instructors are much less costly than full-
time ones as COCAP incurs no social benefit costs on any of
them (Appendix A, para. 1.10).
(k)  Budgetary appropriations seem to be the safest way of ensuring
sufficient funds for  COCAP's  operations.   Export duties are
subject to continuous fluctuations, and the acceleration of
tax exemptions and import formalities are too dependent on
political pressures.
(1)  Studies:  The results  of  the Manpower Training needs studies
of 1982-83 (Appendix A, para. 1.9) were known in time to
enable changes to be made in the original training programs
and adapt them to survey results, due to the delays in
implementation.
(m)  Procurement:  There were  no  unusual problems in tendering on
procurement of civil works or equipment during the life of the
project.
(n)  Bank Supervision:    During  the  first  phase  of the project
(1979-82) Bank mission  did  not  fully  appreciate the highly
technical aspects of LATU activities and in fact caused proj-
ect delays by withholding approving materials and building
designs for considerable length of time. These difficulties
were eventually resolved and from 1982 onward the problem
disappeared with better knowledge and understanding of mission
members. Moreover, because of the tremendous increases in the
local purchasing power of LATU's accumulated reserves, largely
held in US dollars, and the unanticipated increases in their
earnings, the Bank readily accepted the large increases in
LATU's physical plant.   These  were easily justified in order
to prepare LATU for a greatly expanded role in support of the
export industries when the expected expansion in external
demand began to occur in the late 1980s. Nevertheless, the
resulting  civil   works   completion   time   was  constantly
underestimated.

CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
Conclusions
2.1      The objective of the Vocational Training Component 'to establish
an inservicb national vocational training system' through "the new
Vocational Training Council - COCAP" has been met, though as an institution
COCAP is still weak and earmarked funds are not being received regularly.
Although COCAP did not receive budgeted funds until 47 mont;s after the
loan signing and despite recurring budget problems as noted above, it has
trained 1,224 workers and supervisors over the past four years. This was
done through 92 courses averaging fifty hours (50) in length and taught by
a staff equivalent of 6 full time instructors whose services were covered
from fees paid by trainees.
2.2      The objective of the Technological Development Component - "to
assist the Government of Uruguay to improve and expand its domestic
capability in the areas of technological research, dissemination of
information and technical assistance to entrepreneurs, in support of its
export oriented industrial development strategy", has not yet been fully
met, as the building is not complete. As an institution however, LATU is
sound with steady revenues (Appendix B, para. 1.3) from export levy, as
well as fees from private industrial corporations and public companies.
The objective to improve LATU's capability has been met, and the one to
expand its activities will be more than fully met when the remaining
laboratories are completed and all equipment fully installed in the last
half of CY1987.
2.3      In general it can be said that the two institutions sapported by
the project have had, and continue to have, significant impact in their
respective sectors. COCAP's effectiveness is recognized by the
agricultural and industrial sectors, as demonstrated by the fact that the
operating costs for all the training courses for these two sectors have
been paid through direct cost recovery (fees paid by trainees). In the
case of LATU, manufacturers have repeatedly indicated that the technical
assistance provided under the loan and through LATU has been highly
satisfactory. Because of the strengthened LATU many industries have
improved their production methods. These positive outcomes of the project
outbalance many of the problems faced during implementation, so that the
project will leave behind a positive and durable impact.
Lessons Learned
2.4      The major lessons that were learned by the Bank and the Government
of Uruguay in the implementation of Loan 1594-UR are:
A. Inadequacies of Preparation on Appraisal
1.  Manpower Forecasts
The appraisal estimate for COCAP training was unrealistic, as six
mobile training units giving one-to-two-week courses cannot train
even half of the 6,400 trainees noted in the appraisal.  The 1,300



- 6 -
supervisors mentioned are overestimated, as the number of
manufacturing firms with more than 50 employees is rather small.
2.   Enaineering and Architectural Design
Civil works and mechanical systems of this type of technological
facility (LATU) should be fully designed by competent
architectural and engineering consulting firms who have had broad
experience in such design and construction.
3.   New Legislation
When appraising a component such as COCAP which requires approval
of related legislation, the legislation (and proper budgeting)
should be in place prior to Board approval. In cases where this
cannot be done, the enactment of the legislation should be the
object of a dated covenant.
4.   Technical Assistance
If technical assistance can be carried out only when a physical
infrastructure is completed and equipped, the project
implementation schedule should take into accc-int this constraint
and reflect appropriate timing.  LATU could   t use fully its T.A.
because of delays in constructions and bad tining of the T.A.
inputs.
5.   Implementation Plan
Serious considerations should be givon to the advisability of Bank
financing furniture, equipment and T.A. only, when the government
would finance physical facilities. Better alternatives would be
either to include the physical facilities in the Bank loan, or to
defer the loan until constructions are reasonably advanced.
B. Implementation and Supervision Problems
1.   Continuity of Bank Personnel
Lack of continuity by Bank supervising personnel until late in the
project was a factor in early delays and misunderstandings.
2.   Staffing Supervision Missions
Neither technical educators, education economists, nor architects
specialized in school buildings have, with rare exceptions, the
required experience necessary for the technical appraisal or
supervision of a component such as part B. These shortcomings
quickly become apparent to the Borrower (Appendix B, para. 2.12,
2.13). Thus, highly complex technological projects such as the
LATU component should be scrutinized at an early stage to decide
whether the education -- or an industry division would assume the
load.

Preface
1.       This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Vocational
Training Component of the Vocational Training and Technological Development,
Project in Uruguay. On June 23, 1978 a loan (Loon 1594-UR) was approved in
an amount totallin- US$2.9 millions for the Vocational Training Component.
The original Closing Date of June 30, 1983 was extended three times until
June 30, 1986. Because of various reasons, both negative and positive (see
body of report), about US$1.0 millions remained undisburs.ed at the end of
the disbursement period on March 31, 1987.
2.       The PCR was prepared by COCAP's senior technical and management
staff after a thorough briefing by the March 1986 supervision mission of
the Bank.

HiRhlights
1.       The realization of COCAP despite serious recurring budgetary
problems and a staff consisting of only an equivalent of six fulltime
employees, is the most important highlight of this component. Excellent
progress has been made toward the establishment of a training system for
upgrading employed workers. This is amply supported by the fact that
despite the delays in completion of the construction a total of 92 courses
averaging 50 hours in length have been taught to 1,224 workers and
supervisors over the past four years. These have largely been taught in
borrowed facilities with about one third being held in the interior of the
country. Furthermore the recurrent costs for instructor salaries and
instructional supplies have been entirely financed from trainee fees. With
the completion of the new building and the availability of the new
equipment about 170 new courses will be taught to about 2,100 trainees in
1987 and 1988.

VOCATIONAL TRAINING COMPONENT (COCAP)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. BACKGROUND AND PROJECT COMPOSITION
Socio-Economic Setting During Period of Implementation
1.1      The planned dat- for project initiation in 1979 found Uruguay in
an exceptional situation as regards economic growth, increased production
and rising exports and imports, which was reflected in widespread price
$ncreases, including those related to construction of civil works. The
Uruguayan peso appreciated strongly over the period 1979-82, but then
dropped 1202 at the end and this decline continued through 1985, with a
marked contraction in consumption and investment. The same effect was
noticeable in both exports and imports, but was particularly marked for
imports. Early 1985 brought a change in the national government and a
number of economic variables reversed direction, producing a small growth
in GDP that was strengthened in the first half of 1986. Real wages rose,
with a favorable impact on consumption. Investment, however, remained very,
low, especially in the private sector. Exports began to recover in 1986
(up 302), while imports rose at a slower pace (up 13 percent).
Legal Aspects of COCAP
1.2      COCAP was created under law 14869 of February 23, 1979 as a non
government public institution attached to the Executive Department through
the Ministry of Education and Culture, vested with technical,
administrative and financial autonomy under the decree implementing the
aforesaid law.
This law provided that COCAP be managed and directed by an
honorary board whose major tasks include:
(a) promoting the technical/vocational training system and
coordinating its activities with the Ministries of Labor and
Social Security, Agriculture, Fisheries, Energy, and the National
Education Council (UTU);
(b) establishing minimum standards for the technical/vocational
training system; and
(c) evaluating and monitoring the performance of technical/vocational
training plans and programs.
Project Oriain and Formulation
1.3      The project was prepared in 1977 through the combined efforts of
the government and private institutions coordinated by SEPLACODI officials
and with the collaboration of the World Bank.



- 20 -
1.4      The proposed project would assist the Government of Uruguay in
establishing a national vocational training system to provide the manpower
training which is essential for the implementation of its economic
development strategy.
Project Oblectives and Composition
1.5      The basic oblective of the project was to:  establish a national
inservice training system to provide the upgrading training to skilled
workers and technicians, already in the workforce, necessary for economic
development.
Specifically the project originally included:
(a) Construction, furnishing and equipping of a new vocational
training center in Montevideo with about 320 trainee places,
adequate to provide training opportunities for approximately
2,000 workers annually.
(b) Acquisition and utilization of six mobile training units to
train, annually, about 6,400 persons engaged in agricultural
occupations.
(c) Provision of services of specialists (about 9-3/4 man-years)
and of fellowships (about 2-1/2 man-years) for establishing
in-plant training programs for about 1,300 supervisors and
6,500 workers, annually, in the major public utilities,
services and manufacturing enterprises, substantially in
accordance with Part A of the Appendix to this Schedule.
(d) Provision of services of specialists (about 11 man-years) and
of fellowships (about 7 man-years), in support of the general
institutional development of the new vocational training
system and for the establishment of a preinvestment studies
fund, substantially in accordance with Part A of the Appendix
to this Schedule.
(e) Carrying out of surveys for the identification of priority
sectors and/or industries requiring manpower training
services.
Changes in Project Composition
1.6      Because of severe and unanticipated economic reasons, the
Government was delayed for more than three years in meeting the conditions
of disbursement of loan funds regarding: (a) the promulgation of all
regulations required to enable the establishment of a stable and long-term
financing system for COCAP; and (b) the signing of a formal contract with
COCAP covering all important aspects of project execution. It was not
until May 6, 1982 (47 months after loan signing) that these conditions were
met and that the COCAP director could begin to put together his
implementation team and be eligible to receive a budget.  Furthermore,
delays of up to one year in receipt of budgeted funds continued to exist up
until the time of loan closing in 1986, and the very severe cuts in the
amounts even when received, have required changes in the project. However,
if the budgetary problems can be resolved, the medium and longer term
effectiveness of COCAP may not be seriously affected.



- 21 -
1.7      The most detrimental change in the project was the necessity, due
to budgetary restrictions, to temporarily put the newly appointed director
on a one-half time basis up until April 1, 1986, and appoint all remaining
implementation personnel, except for a secretary, on the same basis.
Because only a single building was required, architectural supervisory
services were contracted rather than one being hired and this has proven
acceptable.
1.8      A positive change, in view of the long delays mentioned above, was
the decision to obtain (on a low cost, long term and renewable lease from
CONAE) an acceptable building and to carry out extensive renovations. This
hes resulted in excellent training and administrative facilities becoming
available for use much sooner and at a much lower cost than if a completely
new building had been constructed.

(Net area)
Costs              US$1.48 million                 US$0.25 million
1.9                Another positive change,enabled by the delays, was to
make changes in the original training programs on the basis of the new
insight gained from the completion of the manpower training needs studies
in 1982 and 1983 (para. 1.5, d). Because of construction delays, such
program changes did not result in additional delays to procurement of
equipment. These program changes did require corresponding change in the
kinds and amounts of specialist assistance required.
1.10               Another change in project composition resulting from the
budgetary problems, which seems to be proving a positive one, is that
technically qualified and industrially experienced instructors from
industry are being contracted on an ad hoc part-time basis to teach
upgrading courses in their areas of expertise. Local and external
specialist assistance has been utilized to aid in developing course content
and up grading the technical expertise of these part-time instructors.



- 22 -
Such part-time instructors are much less costly than full-time ones, as
COCAP incurs no social benefit costs on any of them; their technical
expertise will nearly always be more up-to-date than that of full-time
instructors; and they can be fully paid from trainee fees. It is planned
that this system will continue, but that when budgetary problems are
resolved additional full-time instructional coordinators will be employed.
Consequently, no full-time instructors have been transferred from UTU as
was originally planned. However, several key managerial and supervisory
staff have been employed on a half-time basis and, for the short and
medium term is proving to be acceptable and much more economical.
Fortunately, in April 1986 the Director of COCAP was changed to a full time
basis.
II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation Schedule
2.1                As shown in Annex 1, and as discussed in paragraphs
1.06, the project required eight and a half years for completion instead of
the originally estimated five years. Most of the delays occurred between
loan signing in June 1978 and May 1982. The major causes of the delay were
as follows:
(a) The delay of about 47 months (until May 6, 1982) by the Government
(para. 1.6) in the promulgating the necessary laws and regulations
necessary for COCAP to be eligible for a local budget and
disbursement of funds from the loan.
(b) The long delays of up to one year in budgeted funds received by
COCAP and which continued through 1986 (para. 1.6), have resulted
in a much longer implementation period than otherwise needed.
(c) The last equipment tender, for about 20Z of COCAP's total needs,
was delayed for about four months due to delays in the receipt of
budgeted funds for preparation of the equipment specifications.
(d)  The delAys in recruitment of most of the specialist assistance
were due almost entirely to the delays in the availability of the
training facilities required for instruction.
Proiect Management
2.2      As COCAP was a newly created institution to be developed under the
project, its project implementation team and the institutional management
team have been the same. There have been two very distinct phases in
project management in regard to implementation. During the first period of
June 23, 1978 to October 1982, COCAP had no budget, a borrowed office, a
director without a personal telephone and no other staff or regular
secretarial assistance. However, with the assistance of its governing
board they were able to make some progress in course planning, preparation
of some equipment lists and to appoint ad hoc technical committees to
assist in the above.



- 23 -
2.3      In October 1982, the current director was named and seconded to
COCAP on a half-time basis from UTU. During the next few months additional
staff were seconded from UTU, mainly on a half time basis, to fill the
positions of agricultural training coordinator, industrial training
coordinator, accountant, procurement officer and legal advisor (ad hoc).
Also adequate secretarial and other support services personnel wcre
provided on a full-time basis. Concurrently with these personnel, adequate
administrative facilities and two classrooms were made available by UTU,
through a long term lease for full-time use by COCAP. With this management
teem in place, after about 47 months of delay during which relatively
little was accomplished, significant progress began to be made despite
continuing budgetary problems of "much too little* and "much too late".
It was not until April of 1986 that the Director of COCAP became full time.
2.4      During the perioJ of October, 1982 onward the project management
of COCAP has been characterized by the following major "strengths' and
"weakness":s
Strengths a
(a) a dedicated and well qualified staff;
(b) ability to attract considerable interest and personnel assistance
from industry;
(c) a good board of directors representing the various sectors of
economic activity; and
(d) very innovative in initiating training in borrowed facilities in
UTU shops, and in industry while awaiting completion of own
facilities.
Weaknesses
(a) Director (until April 1986) and most other key staff are 'half-
time";
(b) project management has been seriously hindered by grossly
inadequate, and seriously delayed, local budgetary funds;
(c) sufficient numbers of training coordinators have not yet been
appointed due to lack of budgetary funds.
Physical Aspects
2.5      Civil Works.  Because of the long delay in getting a budget
(para. 1.6) for counterpart funding of civil works designs and
construction, and the insufficiency in the amount provided, it was decided
to renovate and expand a UTU training center which could be made available
to COCAP on a long term renewable lease. The renovation and expansion
designs were quickly prepared, approved by the Bank, tendered and



--24-
construction began in August 1984. While its completion was scheduled for
June 30, 1986, as shown in Anne& 1, the final civil works will not be
completely finished until about inril 1, 1987, due to long and repeated
delays in getting counterpart fun's. However, one of the larger shop areas
was available for use about 16 months earlier and equipment was temporarily
installed and treining began.
2.6      The completed facility is proving to be an excellent one that has
provided for additional training and support facilities at a considerably
less cost (US$250,000 as contrasted to US$1.48 M) than the originally
planned building. Civil works details of the completed building are shown
in Table 1 as contrasted to the details of the originally planned building.
2.7      FurnishinR and Equippina.  Virtually all equipment and specialized
laboratory and she  furniture was procured through international
competitive bidding (ICB). Other furniture was procured through local
procedures acceptable to the Bank. Delays in civil works generally caused
corresponding delays in procurement of most furniture and equipment.
However, the mobile training units, some equipment which could be used in
temporary facilities, and the original equipment and furniture for offices
and two classrooms was procured much earlier. Fortunately, because of very
low international rates of inflation in educational equipment during 1981-
85, the delays in procurement did not reduce the original purchasing power
of the equipment allocation by more than about 15% or about US$110,000.
This deficiency was more than offset by the savings in the costs of the
manpower needs studies (Ministry of Labor assumed nearly all costs of these
- see para. 2.8 and the civil works costs, para. 2.6).
Training Aspects
2.8      The project assisted the government in further developing its
training system for upgrading the performance capabilities of skilled
workers and technicians already in the workforce of the agricultural and
industrial sectors and for selected occupations in the service sector of
the economy. The project provided assistance in financing a very detailed
study of the training needs of the industrial sector workforce by
subsectors of activity and types avid levels of occupation, including
managerial and office occupations. This study was carried out in two
phases by the Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MLSS). The first
phase, carried out in late 1982 and early 1983, studied industrial firms
employing 100 or more employees. Of 292 such companies in the total
sector, 261 or 90% participated fully in the study. The second phase was
carried out in 1983 and studied 294 industrial firms employing from 15 to
99 employees. This very complete inventory of the training needs of the
industrial sector is enabling COCAP to plan and implement its training
programs on the basis of recent and still very relevant informetion, rather
than on the basis of the 1977 information used in the preparation and
appraisal of the project. Thus changes in the original training programs
have necessarily been made (para. 1.9).



- 25 -
2.9      Despite the aforementioned implementation delays and extremely
serious local budget problems, COCAP has been able to proceed with its
trining programs on a restricted basis since mid 1983. Numbers of training
courses conducted and total participation by years are summarized below:

Average Courses Length (Hours) - 50
2.10     A total of 24 industrially experienced and well qualified
instructors were contracted in 1986 on a "courseu basis to plan, develop
course materials and conduct the training courses to about 500 trainees, as
mentioned in paragraph 2.8 and Table 1. About 120 man-hours of local and
external specialist assistance was utilized to assist the instructors in
selected course development during the years of 1983 through 1986.
2.11     Only shout 38 weeks of (5 people) fellowship training or study
tours abroad have been utilized of wi_'-. 30 weeks were financed outside the
loan, due to the decision to use mainly par -time instructors from industry
(para. 1.10) Such study tours abroad are difficult to arrange, even for
full-time instructors, in Uruguay due to the economic necessity of holding
more than one job. Consequently, the part-time instructors have received
upgrading through the use of local and external specialists
to assist them in course development. This has proven to be very
effective and directly applicable to the kinds and levels of training
required.



- 26 -
2.12     In addition 14 nationals for 60 m/weeks aid for expatriates for 34
m/weeks, were contracted to prepare additional short training modules
averaging 50 hours each in length, and assist in their initial
presentation.
III. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
Prolect Costs
3.1      The total project cost at the time of completion was US$2.23
(estimate) million equivalent, as contrasted to the estimated US$4.92
million in the SAR. A comparison between actual and estimated costs by
category is shown in the following table and major differences are
discussed below.

_/ Due to additional priority training areas identified in the two
trining needs studies of 1982-83 (para. 2.7)
b/ to vate
3.2      The most significant changes in project costs, as shown in the
above table are those in civil works and the training needs studies, the
results of which are positive in nature, and those in technical assistance
and project administration in which the results are mainly negative. The
reduction in civil works costs are the result of the acquisition,
renovation and expansion of an existing building without any sacrifice in
the quantity or quality of space. This reduction in costs (in US$
equivalents) was helped by the increasing favorable US dollar-peso exchange
rate, which grew faster than the local peso inflation rates in
administrative costs and construction. The greatly reduced costs of the



- 27 -
training needs study was due to the Ministry of Labor assuming all the
labor costs of the studies, with the project paying only the data
processing costs. The negative connotations have resulted almost entirely
from a net reductions in the amount of specialist-hours that could be
effectively utilized because of the aforementioned implementation delays
zaused by the severe budgetary problems. The reductions in the costs of
project administration (project administration is synonymous with COCAP
administration) also had negative connotations. The cause of these cost
reductions were the lack of local budget allocations and receipts, and the
results were those mentioned under the heading of 'weaknesses' of
management in paragraph 2.4.
Financing and Disbursements
3.3      As shown in the table below the proceeds of the loan financed 86%

Government in fulfilling the Conditions of Disbursement and the continuing
serious budgetary problems, the beginning of disbursements was delayed for
about 30 months after loan signing. Details of disbursement are presented
in the Basic Data Section (page iii) and reasons for delay in paragraph 2.1
IV. PROJECT OUTCOMES
Physical Facilities
4.1      Quantitative Improvements.  ThA creation of COCAP and the
provision of 3,000 square meters of "purpose designed and equipped"
training sources has brought about a large increase in the country's
capacity in upgrading the capabilities of adults for the industrial and
agricultural sectors of the economy. Supplementing the training center in
Montevideo, which can accommodate from 300-350 trainees at a time, are five
well-equipped mobile training units, each with a capacity of 10-12



- 28 -
trainees, serving the needs of agriculture in the interior areas of the
country. The total annual training capacity of the center is about 3,800
upgradod or retrained adult workers and supervisors for industry and
another 800 to 1,000 for agriculture, as summarized in Table 1.
4.2      Upgrading and retraining programs in 28 different
subspecializations had been developed and conducted up until the end of
1986. On the basis of other training needs identified in the training
needs studies (para. 2.8) and through discussions of the various COCAP
sectoral and subsectoral advisory groups, programs for an additional 12
specializations are planned for development and implementation in 1987 and
1988.
V. CONCLUSIONS, LESSONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Conclusion
5.1      By far the most important conclusion to be drawn fr'm this project
is the realization of COCAP. Despite recurring budgetary problems and a
staff consisting of only an equivalent of six full time employees,COCAP has
made excellent progress toward the establishment of a training system for
upgrading employed workers. This is amply supported by the fact that,
despite the aforementioned delays in construction,a total of 92 courses
averaging 50 hours in length have been taught to 1,244 workers and
supervisors over the last four years. These have been largely taught in
borrowed facilities, with about one-third held in the interior of the
country. With the completion of the new building, the availability of the
new equipment, about 170 additional courses will be taught to about 2,100
trainees in 1987 and 1988.
5.2      When it is considered that the recurrent costs of all these
courses, including instructor cost, have been paid entirely from collected
training fees, it is readily apparent that COCAP's effectiveness is clearly
recognized by both agriculture and indizstry. With the new building and the
excellent equipment the value of COCAr's contribution to the upgrading
training needs of industry will increase even more rapidly.
Recommendation
5.3
(i)   COCAP should be preserved in its present form with its current
technical, administrative and financial autonomy.
(ii)  The council staff still to be appointed should be completed with
representatives duly designated by corresponding agencies whose
credentials have been presented to Ministry of Education and
Culture for approval since early 1986.
(iii) Comply with the provisions of Law 14869 by furnishing the Council
with appropriate and timely funding either through budget
appropriatioas or, preferably, through assessment of the export
duty approved under the law creating COCAP and by accelerating
tax exemption and import formalities.

Preface
1.       This document constitutes the Project Completion Report (PCR) for
the Technological Development component of the Vocational Training and
Technological Development Project for which a loan (1594-UR) was approved
on June 23, 1978 in the total amount of US$9,700,000, of which USS6,800,000
was for the Technological Development component. The original closing date
of June 30, 1983 was extended on three occasions, ultimately to June 30,
1986. For a variety of reasons (which are discussed in the body of the
report), approximately US$224,220 of the loan amount remained undisbursed
at the end of the disbursement period and is to be cancelled.
2.       This PCR was prepared by members of LATU's senior technical and
administrative staff following the visit by the Bank's supervision mission
in March 1986.

TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT COMPtNENT (LATU)
PROJECT COtPLETION REPORT
HILhlights
In the opinion of LATU, the major highlights of the project are as
follows:
(a) the new facilities will permit the expansion of LATU's special
technical consultancy services to industry by an estimated 352 for
the 1987-1989 period over the 1984-86 period and 12 percent each
for its quality control and import analysis services during the
same period;
(b) the new facilities and technical assistance for LATU staff will
permit the expansion of technological development into new
priority product areas and activities; including pharmaceuticals,
paper pulp and paper, material testing, industrial safety and
health, metrology, bread grains milling and processing;
(c) the expanded facillties, all located on the new site, will permit
the centralization of all LATU's services and, as contrasted to
the proposed division in two different locations some 16
kilometers apart, will result in major increases in efficiency and
eliminate duplication of support services and support personnel;
and
(d) LATU was able to finance the US$14.1 million, part of the project
not to be covered by Bank financing from its own earnings (US$11.9
million) and grants (US$2.2 million). This contrasts sharply with
the US$4.7 million (including US$2.5 millions to be obtained
through a local bank loan), which was predicted at the time of
appraisal. Thus, LATU was able to finance from its own earnings
about US$9.7 million more of the costs than anticipated, was able
to obtained about US$2.2 million from grants and no local bank
loan was required.

DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 1594-UR)
TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT (LATU)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
Social and Economic Situation During Project Implementation
1.01     The planned date for project initiation in 1979 found Uruguay in an
exceptional situation as regards economic growth, increased production and
rising exports and imports, which was reflected in widespread price increases,
including those related to construction of civil works. The Uruguayan peso
appreciated strongly over the period 1979-82, but then dropped 120X at the end
of 1982. Starting in that same year, Uruguay suffered a sharp drop in its GDP,
and this decline continued through 1985, with a marked contraction in
consumption and investment. The same effect was noticeable in both exports and
imports, but was particularly marked for imports. Construction of the civil
works started in March 1982, with completion scheduled for 1987. Early 1985
brought a change in the national government and a number of economic variables
reversed direction, producing a small growth in GDP that was strengthened in the
first half of 1986. Real wages rose, with a favorable impact on consumption.
Investment, however, remained very low, especially in the private sector.
Exports began to recover in 1986 (up 30%), while imports rose at a slower pace
(up 13Z).1
LATU's Legal Structure
1.02     LATU is a public agency under private law, established pursuant to
Article 157 of Law No. 12,803 of November 30, 1960. It is run by a Committee
(Comision) made up of a representative of'the Ministry of Industry and Energy,
who acts as chairman, a representative of the Banco de la Repablica Oriental del
Uruguay, and a representative of the Chamber of Industries (Camara de
Industrias). Its main purposes are to conduct research and studies with a view
to improving techniques for the preparation and processing of raw materials,
developing the use of local or cheaper raw materials and supplies, and making
better use of byproducts.
1.03     To fund its operations, LATU has access to the following resources:  a
3 per thousand levy on the value of exports of specified products; 1% of the CIF
value of goods and merchandise imported under temporary admission procedures,
and 1Z of the CIF value of industrial machinery and equipment imported duty
free.
Purposes and Composition of the Proiect
1.04     The proposed project was intended to assist the Government of Uruguay
to develop domestic capability in the areas of technological research,
dissemination of information and technical assistance to entrepreneurs, in
support of its export-oriented industrial development strategy. Specifically,
the project was designed to assist the Technological Laboratory of Uruguay
(Laboratorio Tecnol6gico de Uruguay) to improve and expand its ongoing quality



- 38 -
control and routine analytic testing, as well as to develop new capabilities to
evaluate technological alternatives, perform applied research to adapt existing
technologies to local conditions, organize market information services and
provide technical assistance to local enterprises. The project was to focus
mainly on the needs of the principal exporting subsectors (food, textiles,
leather goods, and process industries), with a view to improving their
competitiveness in world markets.
1.05     The proposed project was intended to finance the following items:
(a) Construction and/or furnishing and equipping of one general chemical
and microbiological laboratory, five sector-specific laboratories, six
pilot plants, and ancillary facilities (approximately 5,287 m2 total
area); and
(b) Technical assistance relating to the above, including 12 man-years of
spocialist services and 24-112 man-years of fellowships.
1.06     With the exception of the equipment for industrial design and the
technological information services, all the project installations were to be
located at LATU's new site in the Montevideo suburbs., Administration, the
metrology laboratory, the industrial design un'lt and the technological
information services were to remain on the site In the center of Montevideo, at
least for the next five years.
Orifin and Formulation of the Proiect
1.07     To work out the ideas expressed in the preceding section, LATU's
Honorary Management Committee (Comision Directiva Honoraria) appointed a team of
professionals, assisted by a Bank-financed expert, to prepare a prefeasibility
study to support an application by the Government for a World Bank loan.
Technical specialists from the Bank's Education Division reviewed the project
(SAR dated May 25, 1978).
ChanRes in Prolect Composition
1.08     As can be seen from the following table, the planned 5,287 m2 in civil
works grew to become 14,200 m2 (Table 1). This increase was due to an increase
in the number of laboratories as a result of offers of bilateral cooperation,
increases in the planned size of certain laboratories, and construction on the
same site of the administration building and certain other support facilities.
Construction of the latter was expedited in order to take advantage of the
special situation resulting from the reduction in dollar prices in a period of
economic recession.

II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation Schedule
2.01     As shown in Annex 1, and as discussed in paragraph 1.08 and Table 1,
the project required about 8.5 years for completion instead of the originally
estimated 5 years.
2.02     These differences are attributable to:
-    external delays (bad weather, strikes, delayed delivery of materials,
need to import equipment and stupplies);
-    redesign of the original project due to serious design deficiencies by
the original architect;
-    need to redesign the original project (e.g. increase in total areas
brought about by the need to include lines of activity not originally
included, such as metrology, which the Bank had not originally
cousidered remain in the old building);
-    problems with the building contrator;
-    changes in the technical management of the civil works.
-   changes in the world economic situation, producing a recession, with a
slump in exports; however, this did not occasion a shortage of
financing, and it was not necessary to approach other banks for loans
to continue with the civil works;
-   late delivery of materials of domestic manufacture;
-   need to import equipment and supplies; and
-   strikes on the construction site and among suppliers;
The delay in the civil works caused corresponding delays in the rest of the
project such as:
-   delays in imports of equipment brought about by the desirability of
timing their arrival to coincide with completion of the civil works;
-   delays in hiring outside specialists brought about by the delay in
completing the works and in installing the equipment and laboratories;
Civil Works
2.03     These works are based on a design incorporating work units linked
together along a central axis, with a main administration building, auditorium,
library, warehouses and machineroom. Covering a total area of 14,210 m2, the



- 41
complex houses units for Fruits and Vegetables, Dairy Products, Meat Products,
Leather Goods, Paper and Testing of Mat4rials, Central Laboratory, Microbiology
and Textiles. The units handling Fruits, Dairy Products, Meat Products, Leather
Goods and Paper each have a pilot plant and a support laboratory. The plan
allows for additional units to be added along the central axis.
2.04     Special attention is called to the excellent quality of construction,
reflecting good design principles and the use of materials of proven durability
(reinforced concrete structures; walls of pressed brick, special floors of high-
resistance tile, windows of aluminum or stainless steel, air-conditioning
equipment designed for precise humidity control and temperature conditions,
enforcement of painting standards for exposed pipework, special control
equipment in the electrical installations to ensure the highest level of
safety).
2.05     Construction was complex in view of the need to use special materials
(acid-resistant floors), install special drains (to handle corrosive liquids),
carefully modulated air conditioning in extensive working areas, special types
of air conditioning (positive pressure), systems for the removal of
toxic/corrosive gases, drainage and treatment systems for the pilot plants,
double windows with special glazing, special construction systems to permit
greater access for light, and special systems of artificial lighting, to mention
only the most significant aspects. The pilot plants for food processing have to
meet rigorous health requirements, necessitating a special kind of finish for
the buildings. What has resulted is a technological sophisticated complex able
to meet a wide range of rigid requirements. The complex can be expanded by
adding new work units along the central axis. The complex contains
sophisticated air conditioning, sewage and utility systems whose design and
construction are without parallel in Uruguay. At the same time, care was taken
to ensure that it harmonized with the area in which it has been built.
2.06     Execution of the work was delayed by a number of factors:
-   need to make changes to the original proposal;
-   need for outside consultants to make these changes;
-   replacement of original architects following failure to reach agreement
on making these changes;
-    the first call for bids had to be declared null and void because the
construction price quoted was excessive;
-    delay on the part of World Bar,k missions prior to 1982 in approving
procurement of materials and proposed plans;
-    adverse weather conditions that held back piling work;
-    piling errors that took a considerable time to remedy;
-    strikes and labor stoppages;



-42 -
-    delays in importing materials (flooring, joints, piping) and equipment
for air conditioning;
-    difficulties with the construction contractor, reflected in inability
to reach agreement on a firm date for com'pletion of the works; and
-    need to redimension the entire air-conditioning system to correct
errors in the original design.
Furniture and Eauipment
2.07     The list of equipment to be purchased was prepared after studying needs
currently unmet with existing equipment. It was also necessary to purchase
replacement equipment to keep up to date with technical advances in this a:ea.
It should be noted that the equipment purchased is technically sophisticated and
that a sizable proportion of it could be obtained only from a limited number of
suppliers. In some cases, only one manufacturer can provide a specific item.
Technical specifications for each item of equipment were prepared by
specialists. Where the complexity and price of the equipment justified this,
foreign specialists were called in to draw up the specifications. For bidding
purposes, the equipment was grouped into lots. All the calls for bids were
based on specifications comprising general conditions and a detailed description
of the item in question, and the total cost amounted to US$5,277,762.
2.08     The furniture already present in LATU's existing premises was
supplemented by additional items purchased under competitive bidding. Existing
furniture will be reconditioned and work areas will be equipped in a uniform
manner as regards furniture. Every effort was made to harmonize equipment and
furniture procurement with the progress of the civil works, so that items
purchased would not have to remain in storage too long, with all the risks that
would entail. Nonetheless, due to the exigencies of the loan disbursement
schedule, all of the equipment was received before the new buildings were ready
for its arrival. From the financial point of view, the delay in equipment
procurement did not have any adverse effects, as there were no significant
increases in the prices of the items that had to be procured on the
international market.
Specialist Assistance and Staff TraininxI
2.09     Both of these activities depend to a large extent on the new
installations being in operation. The delay in opening the new complex means
that it has not been possible to complete staff training and to fully utilize
the loan funds earmarked for assistance. Total technical assistance during the
period amounted to 198.75 man-months, as indicated below:



- 43 -
Leather Goods             20.00
Meat Products              9.50

Project Administration    1.00
Computing                  0.50
Total       198.75
A large proportion (approximately US$800,000) of this technical assistance was
obtained from international organizations (OAS, UN) or from foreign countries
(Japan, FRG, Spain). The continuity of this aid reflects the confidence placed
in LATU.
2.10     Staff training provided during the period amounted to 82.25 man-months,
as indicated below:
Meat Products              7.25 man-months
Fruits                    17.25 man-months
Instrumentation            3.75 man-months

Project Administration   10.00 man-months
Total        82.25 man-months
Proiect Administration
2.11     In view of the project's complexity and the special technical aspects
involved, responsibility for its implementation was delegated by the Comision
Directiva Honoraria to technical and administrative officers, the Director of
Civil Works and the Project Monitoring Group (Grupo de Seguimiento de Proyecto).
The Monitoring Group comprised an interdisciplinary team made up of an engineer,
an architect, an accountant and an expert on drafting bidding documents and
contracts. Generally speaking, the requisite specialist skills were available
to resolve a wide range of problems; the delays were not attributable to LATU or
to acts or omissions of its management. The start of the project was delayed



- 44 -
for three Years as a result of a decision by the Government in power in 1978,
the reasons for which were never explained and which are not known to the
Comisi6n Directiva Honorarf a.
Supervision by the Bank
2.12     The World Bank dispatched a number of supervision missions during
implementation of the project. During the first phase (1979-81) these missions
helped to define areas of work, although in some cases they did not appreciate
the potential of activities proposed by LATU, refusing to incorporate them into
the loan. Objections were raised to a particular material and the work plans
were held up for a while as a result.
2.13     These difficulties were eventually resolved, &nd from 1982 onward the
problems disappeared with better knowledge and understanding of mission members
of the nature of the project. It should be noted that the procurement
procedures were eased during this period to facilitate acquisition of
specialized equipment.

III. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
Proiect Costs
3.01     The total project costs at the time of completion amounted to US$18.00
million equivalent, as contrasted to the estimated US$11.5 million at the time
of appraisal. However, this US$6.5 million increase in project costs does not
have negative connotations. On the contrary, the overall connotation is a very
positive one, as is discussed in paragraph 3.02 below. A comparison between
actual and estimated costs by category is shown in Table'2 below.

a/ Includes local c sts, but not value of bilateral assistance to project and a
small amount of other multilateral assistance.
b/ Includes costs of additional 8,924 m2 of civil worka, i.e. a 1682 increase,
made possible by the tremendous increases in the purchasing power of LATU's
liquid assets.
c/ Does not include bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the amount of
US$2,200,000, of which about US$800,000 was for specialist assistance.
3.02     The most significant change in project costs is a 216% increase in
civil works costs. However, this was due largely to a 168% increase in the
total square meters of construction and a more than 2002 increase in cost of the
mechanical and electrical systems due to gross errors in the original cost
estimates. As stated in the footnote to Table 2, the additional civil works
were made possible by the tremendous increases in the local purchasing power of



- 46 -
LATU's accumulated reserves, which wore held largely in USS. This increase in
total space is allowing LATU to move its entire operation into the new
facilities (paragraph 4.01).  The decrease of US$1.18 million in costs of
technical assistance is largely offset by about US$0.80 million in specialist
assistance received from bilateral and multilateral grants. The increase of
US$158,000 in equipment costs does not include about TIS$1.40 million received
through a bilateral grant.
Financing and Disbursement
3.03     As shown in Table 3 below, the proceeds of the loan financed only about
302 of total project costs instead of the 592 originally estimated. The change
resulted from (a) the 168S (8,924 m2) increase in total space which was totally
financed by LATU from its own reserve earnings; (b) the US$2.2 million of grants
for equ-. "ment and technical assistance; and (c) reduced costs of technical
assistance financed from the loan.

3.04     Because of the delays in construction (paragraphs 2.02 and 2.06), the
beginning of disbursements was delayed for about 30 months after loan
effectiveness. However, it should be remembered that construction costs were
not financed from the loan and most disbursements for equipment and technical
aesistance necessarily had delays corresponding to the construction delays.
Details of disbursement are presented in the Basic Data Section and reasons for
delays in paragraphs 2.02 and 2.06.

IV. PROJECT OUTCOMES
Improved Services
4.01     This improvement can be measured by means of five indexess
(a) New BuildinRs (cf. Table 1 and para. 1.08)
The new buildings will house the new laboratories and pilot plants, as
explained elsewhere in this report. This will make it possible to
pursue new areas of interest that have had to be put off until now
because of lack of space (biotechnology, worker safety, paper and pulp
etc.), and to carry out assignments in existing areas more efficiently
and cost-effectively. All of LATU's currently scattered services can
now be centralized, with a resultant increase in efficiency.
(b) New Equipment
The new equlpment w.iJ .-rengthen and supplement LATU's existing
equipment and make it roseible to carry out tasks that have had to be
held back. Activities t., be undertaken relate to quality control,
quality certification, research and development, teaching, new
products, industrial processes, and improving product quality.
(c)  Technical Assistance
Technieilc assistance provided directly to industry has enabled
Uruguayan manufacturers to resolve specific problems using the
technology of their choice and to train personnel overseas. The
technical assistance received by LATU has enabled it to embark on new
activities and/or to strengthen various existing activities. Because
of the relatively small number of staff and the existence of agreements
with other governments or foreign agencies, it has not been possible to
make full use of the assistance available under the loan. The non
availability of the new buildings has been an important factor in the
limited use that could be made of this assistance. A new assistance
program for industry, based on internships and visits by foreign
experts and technicians, is strongly recommended in light of the
following factors:
(i) Reflecting the economic difficulties of recent years, the industrial
and economic climate has not favored full utilization of this project
component; now, however, with industrial production and exports
picking up again, the program is having a much greater demand.
(ii) With its new facilities, LATU itself is now in a much better position
to contribute to such a program using the new equipment purchased out
of the loan proceeds.
(iii) Manufacturers have indicated that the assistance made possible under
the loan has been highly satisfactory, and extension of such
assistance would be very well received by industry.
The situation sketched above is a very important consequence of the loan, as it
has spurred various industries to improve their production methods.



- 48 -
(d)   Staff Training
Trips to other countries to observe how similar institutes function
have provided a better idea of how they operate and relate to industry.
The contacts established have been valuable for future assistance
agreements, as it is not easy to create links with organizations in
distant countries. Under either the loan or bilateral agreements,
staff have been sent to courses and congresses in recognized centers to
upgrade their training in specific fields.
(e) New Services to Industry (see Annex 03)
The new facilities will enable LATU to provide new services, both
analytical and technological, that it has not hitherto been able to
offer. These relate to pharmaceuticals, breadmaking, materials
testing, worker protection, metrology, woodpulp and paper, dairy
products, ard the like. The complex also contains facilities for
conferences, courses and exhibitions incorporating the latest advances
in projection equipment, simultaneous interpretation, etc.
4.02     In sum, the project will strengthen and confirm LATU's already
recognized potential in areas accepted by the Bank and enable it to gradually
extend its operations into new fields.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01     In order to achieve its basic objective of assuring the continued
acceptance of Uruguayan exports on foreign markets, and assisting in expanding
sales, the project is enabling greater support to be given to industry as a
result of the new equipment, technical assistance and staff training received.
(a)   Equipment
The project provided the institute with the necessary laboratory and
pilot plant equipment.
Analytical laboratory equipment
(i) Quality control. Uruguay now has a reference center for industrial
controls and a support laboratory.
(ii) Quality certification. The necessary support can now be provided to
Uruguayan exports by ensuring compliance with foreign requirements.
(iii) Research and development. Analytical support can now be provided to
public or nrivate enterprises on request.
(iv) Teaching instruments for teaching purposes can now be made available
to the Universidad de la RepCiblica and the Universidad del Trabajo.



- 49 -
Pilot Plant equiPment
(i) Industrial processes: industrial processes can be adapted and
upgraded either in whole or in part.
(ii) New products: new products of interest to the export sector can be
developed.
(iii) Quality: technologies that will lead to improved product quality are
made available.
(b)   Technical Assistance
This component affords access to both industry and LATU access to
specific assistance in various areas of interest.
(i) Industry: a novel system has been introduced whereby industry can have
the services of an expert of its choice come to work on specific items
of interest to it, and at the same time LATU specialists can be up
graded;
(ii) LATU. In like manner, LATU has received outside experts to work with
industry through its own staff.
(c)   Staff Training
Training has been provided to staff in various areas under two types of
arrangement:
(i) Training overseas, by attending courses, congresses, etc. in recognized
centers for the study of specific topics;
(ii) Local training working alongside experts under contract to LATU.
5.02     The project's contribution to the future development of Uruguay's
export industry can be evaluated against the following facts:
(i) An institution has been tremendously strenghthened and is now fully
competent to provide valuable assistance to industry in quality
control, quality management, technical assistance and applied
research.
(ii) The foundations have been laid for greater and more effective close
collaboration between LATU and industry.
(iii) The newly revitalized paper and pulp industry has recognized the role
that LATU ought to play.
(iv) The foregoing will result in close cooperation between LATU and
industry to implement Uruguay's future development plans.



- 50 -
5.03     In the final analysis, it must be recognized that the initial objective
of the project has been achieved despite the delays in execution of the works
and in the implementation of the technical assistance component. The delays are
in substantial measure attributable to lack of experience with projects of this
type, as this was a first for the Bank.
Recommendations
5.04     A number of difficulties arose as a result of project activities
getting out of u,hase with the progress of the civil works.
(i) Ideally, the project would have had sufficient flexibility built in to
absorb delays in other components. Actual conditions in many countries
should be taken into account in allowing for delays in the importation
of equipment and materials and lack of experience in the design of
technological institutes such as LATU. All of these factors will
result in delays.
(ii) The lending institution should, together with the Borrower, aim at
maximum achievement of goals more than strict adherence to deadlines.
If such an attitude is indeed present, it will be possible to achieve a
better tie-in between completion of civil works, laboratories open for
use, technical assistance and staff training. The equipment could then
be brought into service immediately, avoiding risks of deterioration in
storage, the warranties would still be in effect, and the necessazy
service could be offered.
(iii) There would be need for procedures allowing advance recruitment of
specialists and training centers. The problem lies in the relative
difficulty of finding specialists on specific topics such as those
sought in this case and also of finding training centers able to offer
the specialized subject matter required.
(iv) A final remark concerns a critical aspect of the project, namely the
rush to formalize it. The equipment being financed under the loan was
intended for LATU's new headquarters. Nevertheless, the loan agreement
was signed in June 1978 and work on the new buildings did not start
until March 1982.
5.05     As a result, we lost the grace period, the disbursement period was
foreshortened and we had to ask for extensions; the reimbursement schedule has,
in turn, been trimmed, giving rise to financial problems and the payment of
commitment fees.
5.06     Experience also shows that the technical assistance component ought to
have been in a second phase of the project, thereby allowing for the utilization
of the new and fully equipped facility as the locale for the majority of the
training with the assistance of foreign specialists.
