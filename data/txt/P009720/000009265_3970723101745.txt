PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA - SIXTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(Loan 1313-IN)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Sixth Tele-
communications Project in India (Loan 1313-IN), involving a loan of US$80
million to the Government of India, with the objectives of extending
telephone access, expanding the long distance telephone and telex network,
and helping to improve the quality of service. Additional financing to help
cover foreign exchange costs was to be obtained from a carryover from credit
403-IN for the Fifth Telecommunications Project and a Credit (US$9.0 million
equivalent) from the Government of Hungary. Associated with the project were
a number of institution building activities. The loan was approved in July
1976. Substantial delays in project execution prompted two extensions of the
closing date, first to March 31, 1982 and later to March 31, 1983. The final
disbursement was made in August 1983, about 40 months behind the original
schedule.
The PCR was prepared by the Industry Department and is based on
information in Bank files, field visits in July 1983 and February 1984 and
material prepared by the Indian Posts and Telegraph Department (PET). It has
been prepared thoroughly and examines the design of the project, elaborates
on particular aspects of the institutional development and operational
performance of the Telecommunications Branch of PET, comments on the
justification for Bank support of the project, and draws lessons from the
project experience.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by Operations Evaluation Department (OED),
but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report
to the Government and P&T for their comments. The comments which were
received have been taken into account in preparing the final report and they
are reproduced in the Appendix.

INDIA
SIXTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
LOAN 1313-IN
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The sixth Bank-financed telecommunications project in India was
intended to finance a major part of the foreign exchange costs of the
FY1977-79 investment program of the Telecommunicatiuns Branch of the Indian
Post and Telegraphs Department. Due chiefly to procurement delays (paras.
3.05-3.06), particularly for directly imported items, the loan was not
fully disbursed until FY84. The slow utilization of Bank funds was
particularly unfortunate in the context of a telecommunications network
suffering from extreme shortage of investment funds (paras. 5.12, 7.09,
7.13). Part of the delay was due to the necessity of resolving a major
technological debate within the GOI on the desirability of replacing the
electro-mechanical analog technology which dominated the network (and the
domestic manufacturing system) in 1976 with a progressively developing and
increasingly inexpensive digital electronic technology. Over the life of
this project the debate was resolved in favor of the latter (para.
8-01) with transfer-of-technology agreements concluded for both trunk and
local digital electronic exchange manufacture and an impending agreement
for electronic teleprinter manufacture. Unfortunately, additional
procurement delays arose due to bureaucratic problems a-d problems with
equipment specification.
2.        While some development momentum was maintained under the project,
network expansion proceeded at a rather low level (para. 4.01), waiting
lists expanded enormously (para. 4.03), quality of service stagnated due in
part to extreme shortage of facilities relative to burgeoning demand
(para. 4.02), and the financial situation of the network deteriorated to
some extent due to failure to meet demand, to continuing overstaffing
(para. 7.07), and to dispersion of investment insufficiently guided by
commercial considerations (paras. 4.01, 7.08-7.11). Despite these
disturbing trends the financial (and other) covenants of the project
loan were still fully met (para. 2.07).
3.        Furthermore, at the end of the project period several encouraging
trends emerged, including a revived interest within GOI to improve quality
of telecommunications services and to invest heavily to do so in a
concentrated fashion (para- 4.04) and increased emphasis on quality control
of manufacturing operations. Unfortunately, these initiatives will require
several years to fully materialize, during which time substantial
improvements in telecommunications service and financial returns will be
difficult to achieve.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Telecommunications services in India are provided by the
Telecommunications Branch of the Department of Pbsts and Telegraphs (E&T),
which operates under the Ministry of Communications. A separate government
agency, the Overseas Communications Service (OCS), which also operates
within the Ministry of Communications, provides international
telecommunications services.
1.02      The telecommunications equipment manufacturing industry is also
largely government owaed. The three major manufacturers are Indian
Telephone Industries Ltd. (ITI), Hindustan Cables Ltd. (HCL) and Hindustan
Teleprinters Ltd. (HTL). These three major manufacturers are supported by
a large number of small private firms acting as sub-contractors. ITI and
HTL come under the ambit of the Ministry of Communications and HCL under
the Ministry of Industrial Development.
1.03      The Sixth Telecommunications Project was a self-contained part of
the P&T expansion program for FY77-79. The expansion program itself
was intended to complete the implementation of the last three years of the
Fifth Five-Year Plan. The total cost of the 1977-79 program was estimated
at Rs. 9,023 million (US$1,003 million) with a foreign exchange component
of Rs. 2,421 million (US$269 million). The project's capital cost was
originally estimated as 41% of this program (para. 2.04).
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Preparation and Appraisal
2.01      During implementation of the Fifth Telecommunications Project
the Government of India (GOI) discussed Bank assistance in financing the
remainder of the foreign exchange cost of the P&T's Fifth Five-Year Plan
(April 1974 to March 1979) in a manner similar to the assistance provided
previously. An appraisal mission visited India from November 10, 1975 to
December 3, 1975. Negotiations for the loan took place in May, 1976. Loan
No. 1313-IN for US$80 million was approved by the Bank's Board of Directors
on July 6, 1976 and the loan agreement was signed on July 22, 1976.

Prolect Oblectives
2.02      The project was formulated within the framework of the national
five-year plan. It was designed to extend telephone access in India,
expand the long distance telephone and telex network, and help improve the
quality of service. Associated with the project were a nuumber of
institution building activities (para. 6.01).
Project Description
2.03      The Bank financed project consisted of the following main item.:
(a) installation of 274,000 line units of local telephone exchange
equipment including introduction of modern electronic switching
equipment;
(b) provision of cables and associated equipment to permit the
connection of about 220,000 direct exchange lines (DELs);
(c) extension of existing trunk exchanges and installation of new
trunk exchanges including modern electronic switching equipment
to accommodate about an additional 23,000 lines;
'd) transmission equipment including radio, coaxial cable and
multiplex equipment to increase capacity on routes between
important cities and for expansion of the trunk lines network to
more remote rural areas;
Ce) small satellite earth stations to provide reliable good quality
communications between the Andaman Islands and the mainland; and
(f)  telex exchange equipment including electronic telex exchanges for
Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta and Madras, as well as associated
teleprinters.
2.04      The original estimated cost of the project was US$415 million
including a foreign exchange cost of US$103 million. The loan of US$80
million covered about 78Z of the estimated foreign exchange cost of the
project, including the cost of equipment imported by the P&T plus the
estimated foreign exchange cost of imported raw material used in the
production of telecommunications equipment purchased by the P&T from the
indigenous manufacturers, ITI, HCL and HTL.

the GOI.
Covenants
2.07      Aside from standard covenants the loan agreement provided that
the borrowet should:



- 4 -
(1)   (a)  establish and maintain tariff  for telecouuunication
services at an annual rate of return of not les than
11% on the value of the not fixed assets in operation
of the Branch adjusted in accordance with l(b);
(b) review or cause to be reviewed, the value of the net
fixed assets in operation of the Branch whenever
appropriate, and in any case not leas frequently than
every five years, to determine whether adjustments to
such values, and for the purposes of 1(a) are
required.
(2)   cause P&T to continue the financial raorganization of the Branch
that will result in progressively providing adequate financial
information to the management in the Circles/Districts.
(3)   cause P&T to establish a special unit within the Btanch not later
than December 31, 1976 to undertake economic analysis in
telecommunications and to furnish to the Bank its work program
yearly starting from December 31, 1977.
These three important specific covenants have been met. Evaluation of
P&T's compliance with loan covenants is summarized in Annex 1.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, OPERATION AND COST
Loan Effectiveness and Project Start-up
3.01      The loan was made effective on September 14, 1976 and the project
start was prompt, especially the disbursement of the proceeds allocated to
Category 2 (purchases from domestic factories).
Revision of the Project
3.02      Several major revisions were made in the project.  The following
specific adjustments occurred with the consent of the Bank:
(a)  additional orders were placed on contracts signed under
ICB for 3,000 lines of electronic trunk telephone exchange
for Bombay and a total of 9,600 lines of electronic telex
exchanges for Bombay (3,600 lines), Delhi (3,800 lines),
Calcutta (1,000 lines), and Madras (1,200 lines);
(b)  in order to ensure the full utilization of the loan by the
extended closing date of March 31, 1983, an amount of
US$2.5 million was transferred from Category 1 to Category
2 of the loan. This amount was originally intended for:
(i) retention money (USS0.47 million) for the telex
exchanges, (ii) tag blocks (US$1.03 million); and (iii)
multiforge machines for P&T factories. This amount could



- 5 -
not be disbursed for the original purpose before the
closing date due to delays In delivery. However, this
procurement was financed out of the proceeds of the
seventh loan, 1592-IN;
(c)  the financing of the Jabalpur and Calcutta galvanizing
plants was transferred to the seventh project.
b          Details of these adjustments are given In Annex 2.
3.03      The original and revised loan allocations are shown:

Implementation Schedule
3.04      The original implementation schedule was to be over fiscal years
1977, 1978 and 1979. However, substantial delays in project execution
prompted two extensions of the closing date first to March 31, 1982 and
later to March 31, 1983.



-6-
3.05      The main reasons for the delay from the appraisal schedule were:
(a) the bidding documents for the electronic switching
equipment were issued only in July 1978 instead of July
1977 when the Bank cleared them. The decision making was
delayed due to long and intenee policy discussions, as
major technological decisions were Involved. Similar
delays in the evaluation of bids and approval of contracts
eventually resulted In a delay in implementation of the
project of over two years (para. 3.06);
(b)  shortfalls in supply of switching and other equipment from
ITI during 1977, 1976 and 1979 due to various reasons such
as power shortages, industrial disputes, product design
deficiencies, and lack of incentives for productivity
improvements;
(c)  delays in delivery and installation of imported telex
exchanges due to procurement difficulties and delay in
building construction.
The original implementation (and disbursement) schedules were also, in
retrospect, extremely optimistic (para. 3.10).
Procurement
3.06      Procurement delays were a significant problem in project
execution, particularly for imported equipment. Apart from routine delays
within the Government procurement approval system and in the specification
and bid evaluation process within the Telecommunications Branch, where
project procurement involved import of equipment embodying new electronic
technology, major technological debates  para. 3.05a) within the GOI
delayed implementation by several years.  While procurement of local
equipment proceeded smoothly, supply by the locsl factories lagged far
behind orders (and payments) and quality of output was generally poor.
1/ GOI has stated that it is aware of the problem and steps are being
taken at the highest level to streamline the procedures (Appendix).

3.08      The cost overrun of about 11% of the original cost is largely

and partly to local price escalation, which was around 30%, slightly above
the appraisal estimate of 22% for price contingencies.
3.09      The actual achievements in the three fiscal years (FY1977-79) of
the Fifth Five-Year Plan, compared with the main targets of the expansion
program for these years, as defined in the appraisal report, were as

IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01      In terms of physical achievement, the record of the project and
the overall telecommunications investment program is mixed (para. 3.09),
with performance far exceeding original targets for installation of
facilities serving the general public (telegraph and public call offices),
approaching 80% of original targets for telephone network expansion (local
subscribers exchange capacity and direct exchange lines), and generally
falling far short of targets for long distance service (switching and
transmission) and telex networks, which are the most profitable components
of the system from a commercial viewpoint.
4.02      The overall quality of service of the telecommunications network
appears to have improved to a limited extent during the three years of
major project expenditure (1977-79), in part because the network was
expanding in size quite rapidly during the period (28Z in three years)
which eased the congestion problem to some extent, and partly because the
project helped to introduce a stronger institutional emphasis within the
Telecommunications Branch on monitoring the quality of service and
undertaking a rehabilitation program to directly attack the most
fault-prone system components. Between 1979 and the present, however,
service levels have probably declined somewhat, as demand again overwhelmed
the relatively small system,2/ system expansion slowed down3l, an
increasing volume of reinvestible Telecommunications Branch surpluses were
drained out of the sector to finance increasing postal deficits, the
overaged stock of equipment physically depreciated further, and possibly,
the quality of domestically manufactured telecommunications equipment
declined. The SAR made clear (e.g., paras_ 3.01-3.04 and 6.02) that the
project could not hope to meet more than a fraction of outstanding and
projected demand. Net investment in the sector is and has been simply too
small to generate rapidly expanding and improving service and to prevent a
long-term deterioration in its financial position. Indeed the SAR
projected (paras. 5.22-5.2") that over the period 1975-79 funds flowing
from the Branch to other Government entities (including interest payments)
would be about 250% of the amount of funds flowing to the Branch from
Government. Only at the nresent moment has GOI begun to take steps to
prepare a substantial infusion of external funds into the
telecommunications sector.
4.03       The demand for service has remained buoyant after a settling
down period following the sharp drop in the level of the waiting list with
the introduction of the Advance Deposit" Scheme in 1976. Under this
arrangement intending subscribers were obliged to pay in advance a deposit
ranging from Rs. 1000 to Rs. 5000 in order to register on the waiting

Hong Kong.

list. This caused the official waiting list to drop from 637,000 in 1975
to 250,000 in 1976 and 243,000 in 1979. The relatively high connection
rate durlng 1977-79 also helped to reduce the waiting list although the
latest evidence on demand in India suggests that it has now again grown to
an all-time peak of over 700,000, despite selective increases in the size
of deposits. This implies that there is a large latent reservoir of
suppressed demand for telecommunications services.
4.04      Although telecommunications investments in India have been
generally successful, investments in the sector have continued to be below               4
requirements (see below, para. 7.13). The sixth project has not changed
substantially the problems of the high unmet demand, low penetration,
and/or unsatisfactory service coverage of either the urban or rural areas.
The subsequent seventh and eighth projects were designed to address the
basic problem of supply of switching equipment, and the subsequent decision
of GOI in 1982 to build two production units with an eventual total annual
production capacity of one million lines of digital electronic exchange
equipment will hopefully alleviate this problem in the loiag term. The
problem of inadequate investment in network expansion and upgrading will
not be finally solved, however, until a major policy shift from heavy
reliance on internally generated funds towards increased external
investment (para. 5.12), is decided at the highest levels of GOI. This
policy shift may now be forthcoming in the form of a proposed Crash Program
of telecommunications investment.

Operating Results
5.02      The operating revenues for P&T have been generally satlsfactory.
The revenues were significantly higher during FY1977 and 1978 but were
lower during FY1979-82 than forecasted in the appraisal report due to
delays in implementation of P&T's program. However the revenues for 1983
were satisfactory, following substantial tariff increases in 1982. There
was a significant reduction in expenses compared to appraisal estimates
during FY1979-81, which was reversed in 1981-83.
5.03      During FY1977-83, operating revenue increased from Rs. 4,354
million to Rs. 9,404 million with an annual growth rate of 14M, while
operating expenditure increased from Rs. 2,340 million to RB. 6,007 million
with an annual growth rate of 17%. As a result the operating ratio with
depreciation on historical cost increased from 54% in FY1977 to 64% in
FY1983, moving in the opposite direction from that projected with rising
staff expenses exceeding comendable increases in revenues (para. 7.06).
5.04      Telephone revenues during FY1977-83 increased from Rs. 3,540
million to Rs. 8,091 million reflecting an increase in total telephone
revenue per DEL from Rs. 2,189 to Rs. 3,281, an annual growth rate of 7Z.
5.05      During the period FY1977-83 telex facilities continued to be both
popular and profitable, revenues increasing from Rs. 247 million to Re. 821
million (annual growth rate of 20%). Total telegraph revenues increased
from Rs. 334 million in FY1977 to Rs. 750 million in FY1983 (annual growth
rate 16%).
5.06      The annual rate of return on average net plant in operation on
historical cost basis declined from 32.0% in FY1977 to 19.4% in FY1983.
The rate of return on revalued cost basis was 24.8% in FY1977 and declined
to 13.22 in 1983 (see paras. 7.05-7.13).
Revaluation Of Assets
5.07      To calculate the annual rate of return on revalued net plant in
operation in the financial forecast, the net fixed assets in operation as
of March 31, 1980 were increased by about 25% on the basis of a revaluation
study on the life of fixed assets and the current value of the various
categories of assets. For future revaluations, the forecast assumed an
index of 6% per year which is broadly in line with the past experience of
other available indices of manufacturing costs of telecommunications
equipment and components. For purposes of calculating annual rates of
return, the P&T is continuing on a memorandum basis, to review and
determine annually its telecommunication assets in a manner acceptable to
the Bank.

Financial Position
5.08      F&T's financial position during the period FY1977-83 is reflected
in the balance sheets which are given in Table 2 of Annex 2. As of March
31, 1983, F&T's total net fixed assets, including the plant under
construction, amounted to about Rs. 26,060 million, some 155% higher than
in March 1977. PST's inventory level has been satisfactory, at least in
financial terms. The yearly accounts receivable position has also been
satisfactory.
5.09      P&T's current ratio has been satisfactory.  This is because P&T
operates on a cash basis as a Government department and the current
liabilities including accounts payable have been relatively low while the
current assets including inventories and accounts receivable are higher.
5.10      Debt service coverage bas been satisfactory, as has the debt/
equity ratio, although in the context of P&T as a Government department,
these two ratios are not very meaningful or important.
Financial Plan
5.11      The statements of actual and forecasted sources and applications
of funds for the period FY1977-83 are given in Table 3 of Annex 3 and are
summarized below for the seven-year period as a whole.

5.12      P&T was able to generate 68% of the fund requirements for
investment from internal cash generation net of debt service. This
compares favorably with a forecast of 60% for the period, and, despite a
drop in the receipt of subscriber and OYT deposits (these are now held in



- 14 -
the Ministry of Finance until subscribers are connected), has resulted in a
reduced amount of borrowing.   However, even this degree of self-financing
of investment, which is very high by international standards, understates
the true situation with regard to the Telecommunications Branch. Deducting
transfers from the Branch to postal and other accounts, the net
self-financing ratio of telecommunications investment rises to 82%.
Finally, much of the Government contribution allocation is actually
intended to compensate the branch for customs duties paid on imported
equipment, a form of transfer from telecommunications revenues to Central
Government accounts. Deducting this amount from the costs of
telecommunications investment raises the self-financing parameter to as
high as 108%; i.e., the subsector is a net contributor to government
revenues even on a cash basis. Given the relatively small size and poor
quality of the network, telecommunications development in India %ay be
severely hindered by excessize reliance on internally generated funds for
investmert.
Tariffs
5.13      An annual tariff exercise is conducted by P&T mainly with a view
to augmenting the internal resources for its development programmes.
Recommendations for tariff revision are approved by the Government and
placed !hefore the Parliament. The tariff revisions effected from March 1,
1976, increased the rates for most of the main services and generated about
25% increase in revenue. During 1979, FST introdutced a differential tariff
structure for its local telephone services.  In September 1980, P&T
increased the rates for trunk calls by about 30%-50% depending on the
distance. The rates for local calls were also increased. In July 1981,
PFT increased the local call rates further and raised the Own-Your-Tele-
phone (OYT) deposit requirements by 50%-70% depending on the size of
exchange. The revisions in March 1982 increased the rental charges by 50%
and the quarterly billing system was changed to bi-monthly billing system
with corresponding changes in the local call slabs. The tariff revisions
effected frnm March 1, 1983 related to long distance circuit rentals which
were increased by 100%. Installation charges and rates for telephone
extensions and additional and auxiliary facilities of teleprinter machines
were also revised upwards by about 50%.
Commercial Accounting System
5.14      P&T has developed for the Telecommunications Branch a commercial
accounting system which is the basis for all financial reporting within PST
as well as to Government. Although the accounting system on an accrual
basis was started as early as FY69, the double entry system of accounts was
introduced only with effect from April 1, 1972. As agreed under Credit
403-IN, P&T extended the accounts to the regions including all the circles
and districts. P&T management is using the information based on these
accounts as a major element of the Management Information System for its
day-to-day operations. The commercial accounts are audited by the
Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) and presented to Parliament (see
paragraph 5.17).



- 15 -
Transfer of Postal Accounts
5.15      On April 1, 1976, the postal accounts were transferred from the
C&AG to P&T together with the transfer of about 7,000 staff performing this
function. Previously P&T's accounting function had been divided between
P&T and the C&AG, with P&T responsible for the telecommunications accounts
and C&AG responsible for the postal accounts. With this change, P&T was
able to allocate expenses between the two branches as they accrued and to
maintain the accounts on a more current basis, and therefore avoid the need
for coordinating the accounting function between two different bodies.
Audit
5.16      The loan agreement required that provisional financial statements
be submitted within four months of the close of the fiscal year (i.e., by
the end of July of each year) and that audited financial statements be
submitted within a reasonable time thereafter. The reports were submitted
as follows:
--Date Submitted to IBRD-
Reporting Year               Provisional         Audited
FY1977                   Aug, 16, 1977     Jan. 31, 1979

1979                  Aug. 20, 1979      July 28, 1981

1983                  Sept. 13, 1983            -
5.17      The delay in submission of audited accounts for FY1977-1980 was
laroely due to the late closing of accounts and partly to delay in audit.
There has been a significant improvement in submission of audited accounts
to the Bank since FY1981.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.01      The material management system and the Management Information
System (MIS) introduced during the fifth project were further developed
under the present project and continued to operate effectively. During the
course of the sixth project the Economic Study Cell has been established
and staffed. The work of the Cell contributed to the improvement of the
quality of investment planning and to better management of the P&T
Department. Some of the studies completed by the Cell were: (i) telephone
demand studies; (ii) opinion surveys; (iii) employment study in P&T; and
(iv) local call distribution studies.



- 16 -
Staff Recruitment, Training and Development
6.02      The staffing ratio of the Telecommunications Branch is very high
by international standards. At the commencement of the expansion program
of FY77-79 there were approximately 163 staff per 1000 DEL. and this was
reduced to 155 staff per 1000 DELs in 1979 and 134 in 1982.4/ The drop in
this ratio reflects a trend in the correct direction, but maJor
improvements in staff productivity must still be made.
6.03      P&T has adequate training programs for telecommunications staff.
There are 25 Circle/District training centers and 13 regional training
centers. In addition, an advanced training center has been established in
Ghaziabad with assistance of UNDP/ITU. During FY78 and FY79J over 25,882
candidates at various job categories completed technical training courses.
P&T also offers refresher courses for in-service training and over 21,605
candidates including 161 accounting staff completed these courses during
FY78 and FY79.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
7.01      Financial Internal Rate of Return on Investment.5/  In projects
where new capital is being added to an existing stock or network, it is
quite difficult to identify the exact output resulting from the fresh
investment. It is even more difficult to isolate the output which has
resulted from a particular component of the investment program. Therefore,
the financial IRR has been calculated on the overall expansion program of
the P&T during the years of the project execution (1977-83). Also, the
calculations have been made on an incremental basis since conventional
with-and-without analysis was considered quite speculative in this case.
7.02      The calculations are based on the following assumptions:  (i)
The entire cost of the investment program for 1977-83 has been taken as the
investment cost. (ii) Operating costs and benefits relating to the
increment in the network have been determined by calculating total
incremental Telecommunications Branch operating costs and revenues per
telephone DEL6/ in service for each year, and allocating against the
investment coBt those incremental annual flows attributable to DELs
installed during the project period. (iii) The annual flows have been
lagged one year behind related investments to account for the installation,
connection, and commissioning period. For 1984 it is assumed that the
4/ For comparison, the staffing ratios (staff per 1,000 DELS) range from
8-10 in the U.S. and Western Europe, to about 22 in Thailand, 66 in
Ethiopia and 150-160 in Upper Volta and Bangladesh.
5/  This section (paras. 7.01-7.03) is based on the work of the Economics
Study Cell of the P&T, which was established under this project.
6/ From 1977 through 1979 telephone revenues represented over 80% of total
Branch operating revenues, rising to 86% in recent years.

fairly modest target of 200,000 DELs will actually be placed in service. A
final year of benefit build-up (1985) has been included to serve as a proxy
for all future increases in traffic over the project DELs due to overall
network expansion. The target for 1985 (541,000 additional DELs) may well
not be achieved in that year, but since all subsequent incremental real
revenues per DEL have been ignored this assumption is still conservative.
7.03      Equipment life has been assumed at 20 years without salvage
value, which is also conservative in the Indian context.  Inflation over
the project life has been taken as 4% per annum through 1983, after which
it is assumed that unit operating costs, tariffs, and net benefits per DEL
will increase roughly in line with general inflation and hence remain
constant in real terms. The financial IRR on the basis of these
assumptions is 12.5%, as opposed to the 20% projected at appraisal. The
relevant parameter streams are given below:

Internal rate of return:  12.5%.
7.04      Aside from the factors noted above, which may have depressed the
financial IRR by a point or two, an important factor in the relatively low
IRR is the fact that a significant proportion of the Telecommunications
Branch construction budget over the past several years appears to have been
devoted to replacing existing assets (fully depreciated both physically and
financially) rather than to expanding the network. This category of
expenditure has thus served to maintain existing net revenues from pre-1977
DELs rather than to install new DELs, leading to an under-allocation of net
revenues to the current project and thus to an underestimation of the
actual rates of return by the calculation performed above.

7.05      Annual Financial Rate, of Return.  Annual Telecommunications
Branch rates of return on both hlstorical and revalued costs of the asset
base show a continuously declining trend over the project period, as
indicated below:

1982/83                          19.4                13.2
Although the most recent results still fulfill the covenanted minimum of
11% on revalued assets, are better than most years prior to 1976, and are
roughly in line with appraisal projections, the trend is disturbing. The
trend does not appear to be due to policy on tariffs, which have been
regularly increased by rather substantial proportions over the life of the
project (para. 5.13). Further real general tariff increases (above the
general rate of inflation) may be difficult to impose unless the quality of
service is substantially improved. There may be scope, however, for
initiating the metering of local service, which could possibly raise
revenues and reduce peak hour congestion (a major cause of poor service
levels) simultaneously.
7.06      Factors in Financial Performance.  Aside from the tariff
question, the financial (and economic) performance of the Branch is most
influenced by the complex of factors summarized by the operating ratio (the
ratio of expense to revenues), the allocation of investments, and the costs
of investment. Contrary to appraisal projections the operating ratio has
increased significantly during the latter years of project implementation
(to 64% in 1982-83 as against a projected 57%), with rising staff expenses
(two-thirds of total expenses) exceeding commendable increases in revenue:

7.07      As demonstrated above, the two major cost categories (which
exhibit nearly identical behavior) increased faster than revenues In each
year since 1976/77. Within the stAff expense category, costs per staff
member (i.e.. wages) increased in current Rupee terms between 8 and 13%
durtng each of those years. In part this was due to a justifiable
improvement in the mix of Branch staff, with the numbers of engineers of
various grades increAsing much faster than the unskilled staff. But the
overlond of redundant laborers (readily admitted by most local network
mar.,1gers) in still very great, and actually seems to hinder efficient
operations, aside from its financial implications. Despite the external
political and humanitarian pressures to use the Branch as a haven of
relatively well-paid employment, the government bhould consider encouraging
the Branch to limit its recruitment of redundant grades of staff to a very
low (or zero) rate of increase, justified strictly on the amount of work to
he done. Contracting out of telephone installation, house wiring, and
crthle laying should also he stimulated. 7/
7.08      While revenues have grown at a reasonable rate over the project
period, they could possibly have increased faster if a greater proportion
of investment had been directed to the more profitable long-distance
components of the network as against general locil network expansion. A
comparison of traffic growth rates (or their proxies) and the growth of
operating revenues is giver, below:

so that much of the increase in long-distance telecommunications has
continued to depend on operator connections. Thus local traffic growth has
far outpaced long-distance calling. Regarding the telex component of
long-distance service, due to slow procurement of telex exchange equipment
and teleprinters the growth of this highly profitable component has

declined precipitously in recent yearm;A/ loan-financed electronic telex
exchanges In the metropolitan cities are only now being comuLssioned Into
service. Arguing the same case,P/ S.N. Raul and V.R. Iyer estimate that
long-distance telephony accounts for between 421 and 52X of all telephone
network revenues and that all long-distance telecommunications (Including
telex, telegraph, and leased circults) accounts for 53X to 61X of total
sector revenues. As against this, they calculate that invstments in
long distance tranimission (including switching) averaged only 27X of
sector inveetmentc over the project period, and are planned for no more
than 34X of Sixth Plan (1980-85) outlays. It appears that allocation to
this component of the sector must be raised in absolute terms to expand
carrier and switching capacity, but it munt also be noted that local
networks (which have also expanded at a sub-optimal pace) are the sources
and destinations of long-distance traffic, and that a substantial portion
of long-distance call attempts fail in the congested destination local
network. The fundamental problem is insufficient investment in the sector;
allocations within that investment program are a secondary problem.
7.10      Within the field of local telephone network expansion, more
emphasis on commercial criteria would probably increase revenues, operating
ratios, and surpluses for any given levels of investment and expenses. A
prime case would be the priority accorded to Own Your Telephone (OYT)
applicants for connections, who in large exchange areas pay a deposit of
8,000 Rs. when they apply. Since the advance deposit scheme was introduced
in 1976 the quota of new connections in any exchange area assigne:4 to OYT
applicants has declined from 70% to 30%, while the OYT waiting list has
increased to 63,000 and the average waiting time for a connection to 3-4
years. Given the size of the deposit, OYT depositors could be expected to
generate a greater than average volume of traffic (including long-distance
traffic) and revenue per DEL, in addition to the fact that the deposits
themselves are transferred from Finance Ministry accounts to the
Telecommunications Branch only when subscribers are connected.
7.11      Improved financial results could also probably be achieved
through more concentration of investment. Local operating ratios are
generally far lower (e.g., in the 20%-40% range) In well-run urban
networks, whether in metropolitan, major, or minor cities, than in the more
rural state "circle" networks (e.g., 40% and above).  The major factor here
is the far lower average annual expenditure per DEL in the urban networks,
rather than the slightly higher average revenue per DEL.

of the Economics Cell of the P&T, Mr. Iyer a research officer.

7.12      Finally, a simple comparison of the number of incremental DELs
connected each year with the size of the Branch's construction program in
the previous year indicates that investment costs per DEL did not increase
in nominal terms (and decreased in real terms) over most of the project
period, and thus were not the cause of declining annual or investment rates
of return:

7.13      The above table also lends some credence to the thesis that
insufficient amounts were invested in long-distance transmission over the
project period, as most unit costs associated with local network expansion
-lone increased in both nominal and real terms over the period; the only
way costs per incremental DEL could have remained constant over 1977/82
would thus be a proportional decline in investments in other components
(e.g., long-distance transmission and switching, telex, etc.). Of more
importance is the stagnation in the pace of expansion of the total network
over 1976/82, and a major factor in that development, the slow growth in
nominal terms (and stagnation in real terms) of the construction program of
the Telecommunications Branch over 1976/81. Given the insufficient size of
the network in 1976, many of the persistent problems relating to service
quality and even current financial returns may be traced, at least in
part, to severe under-investment in the sector.
7.14      Economic Rate of Return.  Insufficient data is available at
present to recalculate the economic rate of return on the project,
conservatively estimated at appraisal at 30Z. The four main elements which
would substantially raise the economic rate of return above the calculated
financial internal rate of return of 12.5% (para. 7.03) are:
(a) the very large consumer's surplus generated by the
connections and traffic which were actually provided,
given the high advance payments which were paid (with
sub-market interest rates) to be placed on waiting lists,
the rapid expansion of those prepaid waiting lists in
terms of both numbers and anticipated waiting time, and
the rationing of traffic by physical congestion. Given



- 22 -
that telecommunications services are severely rationed by
non-price factors, actual reveni_es are extreme
underestimates of the value of services provided;
(b)  the very high import duties (e.g., 50%-150%) which are
included in the estimated costs of the construction
program, both for directly Imported equipment and for the
materials components (e.g., copper, other metals,
polythene) and machinery depreciation for domestically
produced equipment;
(c) the shadow-pricing of unskilled labor permanently
employed by the Branch (a major operational expense
category), which is paid from 501 to 150% more than
equally qualified casual laborers doing temporary work
for the Branch. In the SAR the shadow-pricing of labor
at 50Z of the financial wage rate raised the projected
IRR from 20% to 30%; and
(d) the general network analysis problem of evaluating the
benefits to existing subscribers of an expanded network.
Although impossible to quantify with any precision at this point, these
factors would raise the ERR to a minimum of 20%. The project was thus
fully justified from an economic point of view, although economic and
particularly financial returns could have been much higher under a
different policy framework.
7.15      Justification of Bank Involvement.  Given the above, and the
general severe shortage of investible funds and foreign exchange available
to the GOI which lead to under-investment in telecommunications, it may be
argued that the present project and the succeeding seventh and eighth
Bank-financed telecomunications projects were critical in permitting the
network expansion and development which did take place, as they provided
over half the external funds invested in the sector and a similar
proportion of the foreign exchange requirements.
VIII.  BANK PERFORMANCE
8.01      The Bank's performance was generally sound.  Bank staff were
particularly valuable in advising the Branch through a period of rapid
technological change in telecomminications technology, indeed the major
period of such change in thepast half-century, with the result that by the
end of the project all relevant agencies in India were fully committed to
the gradual replacement of electro-mechanical analog systems, both in
network operations and in manufacturing. This in itself was a major
achievement. Bank staff were also instrumental in introducing the concept
and practice of quality control in the telecommunications manufacturing
industries although substantial improvements in this area will require
several years to materialize. The Bank was less successful over the



- 23 -
project period in bringing to the attention of high level economic
policy-makers the need for increased investment in telecommunications, in
identifying the nature and causes of the deteriorating financial situation
of the Branch and stimulating improvements in quality of service to
subscribers, in breaking decision-making and implementation (including
procurement) bottlenecks, and in introducing needed innovations in the
organization of the sector. Of these major sectoral objectives, the first
may now be met thanks to the personal interest and involvement of the Prime
Minister herself, while steps to initiate analysis and dialogue on the
remaining objectives are being taken through the preparation of a Ninth
Telecommunications Project.
Working Relationship
8.02      The working relationship between the P&T (and the DRA) and the
Bank were excellent. They tended to be based on frankness plus mutual
respect with an appreciation of the detailed local knowledge of the
environment on the one hand and broad international experience and
expertise on the other hand.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01      The project was a critical step in the maintenance of some
development momentum in the Indian telecommunications sector. More
possibly could have been achieved through project supervision, although
many of the problems encountered arose due to factors outside the control
of the Telecommunications Branch, the IDPT, or the Ministry of
Communications.
9.02      One important general lesson is that the establishment of
indigenous manufacture of telecommunications equipment, involving as it
does quite complex technologies, can never be accomplished quickly. The
estimates for timing of introducing local manufacture should be
conservative rather than optimistic. Also, delivery lead times for
imported custom designed and manufactured items such as long distance
transmission systems tend to be long because of the amount of detailed
specification and preliminary engineering design that has to be done before
orders can be placed.
9.03      Specifically regarding the Indian telecommunications network, the
following conclusions may be drawn:
(a) external investment in the network must be increased if
significant improvements are to be made;
(b)  procurement of imported equipment must be increased,
streamlined, and accelerated if India is to rapidly avail
itself of the benefits of modern electronic technology;
(c) investment must be more stringently allocated to
components and regions promising rapid and large
financial returns;



- 24 -
(d) growth of staff members must be controlled while existing
staff must be managed and motivated more effectively,
both in operations and construction;
(e) local procuremient procedures must be altered to
discipline both the quantity and quality of equipment
supplied from the semi-monopolistic, Government-owned
production units; and
(f) impact of the protective trade and incentives policies to
the efficiency of the domestic manufacturing of
telecommunications equipment must be analyzed and the
policies revised if necessary.
