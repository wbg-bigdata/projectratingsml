INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMEENT CREDIT TO THE
INITED REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
FOR THE
NIETE RUBBER ESTATE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendations on a proposed
development credit to the United Republic of Cameroon for the equivalent of
US$ 16 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a rubber estate project.
About US$ 15.1 million of the proceeds of the credit would be made available
to H6v6a-Camerouu (HEVECAM).   Caisse Centrale de Coop6ration Economique (CCDE)
(France) would Trrke a loan to the Government for the same project e.uivalent
to US$ 4.45 million for 20 years, including 10 years of grace, with interest
to be paid by the Government at 5.5 percent per annum. The above US$ 15.1
million of the proceeds of the credit together with the OCCE and Government
contributions would be made available to HEVECAM as equity (45 percent) and
loan capital (55 percent). The equity contribution of US$ 12.2 million
would consist of US$ 3.5 million IDA funds, US$ 7.7 million Government funds
and US$ 1.0 million CCCE loan funds.   The sub-loan of US$ 14.8 million 7 oTI
consist of rjs$ 11.6 million IDA funds and US$ 3.2 million of CCCE loan fLunds.
The proposed sub-loan would be for 30 years at a 5-1/2 percent interest rate;
no intereWs56 would be charged during the 15 year grace period.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The report, "The Recent Economic Development of Cameroon's (No.
72-247), was distributed to the Executive Directors on November 27, 1972.
A basLc economic mission visited the country in February 1975, and its
prelim.iinary conclusions are reflected in the following analysis.
Eoot mic Potential
3.        Cameroonts natural resources are varied, although not abundant.
Soils and climatic conditions permit cultivation of a wider range of crops
tha.n is commonly found in West Africa, the forest areas of the southeast
contain large untapped timber resources, and the north holds promising
potential for livestock development.
4.        While the main opportunities for development lie in the expansion
of agricultural production, Cameroon also has potential for expanding
production of import substitutes needed for a growing domestic market, and
the processing for export of alumina and agricultural and forestry products.
A bauxite project is in the early stages of preparation, while offshore oil
and gas exploration has so far yielded only modest results.



-2-
Ccmmerce, transportation and transit services are also important
economic activities:  Cameroon is a relatively large country with its main
economic centers separated by vast underpopulated areas, and the country
serves as a main export route for landlocked Chad. As a result, large
investments in port and inland transport infrastructure are prerequisites to
promoting agriculture, forestry, and industry, and strengthening Cameroon's
role as a regional trade center.
Past Performance
6.        During the first decade of independence (1960-1970) the Government's
primary objective was to unify the nation and to ease serious internal
political and social tensions. Although the need to devote substantial
amounts of scarce resources to this end may have handicapped economic develop-
ment, GDP at constant prices grew at a satisfactory rate of over 6 percent a
year. Cash crop production rose steadily due to good export prices and
favorable weather conditions, and manufacturing production increased as a
result of the liberal investment climate that attracted substantial foreign
private capital.
7.        During the 1960s gross investment averaged about US$ 200 million
annually (in constant 1974 dollars), i.e. 14 percent of GDP. Public invest-
ment accounted f or about 57 percent of total investment with the largest part
devoted to the transportation network, the most immediate development con-
straint; while substantial effort was also directed at expanding education
and diversifying agriculture. Significant increases in fiscal revenues com-
bined with stringent expenditure controls produced sizeable budget surpluses
that made it possible to finance a large part (up to 40 percent) of public
investments out of local revenues as well as to accumulate reserves. However,
this policy also imposed excessive restraint on much needed current expendi-
ture in such areas as road maintenance, public health, and education.
8.        In the early 1970s, economic growth slowed down to less than
3 percent p.a. or little more than population growth. This was caused by
(i) low export prices for cocoa and coffee during 1971-72 and a drought in
the north, and (ii) a decline in private investment triggered by the relative
stagnation of the agricultural sector, in addition to the completion of the
most obvious import substitution projects during the preceding decade.
9.        The Government reacted to these developments by stepping up public
investment, whose volume increased by 50 percent to reach annual averages of
about US$ 200 million in constant 1974 dollars during the Third Development
Plan (FY72-76) and resulted in a substantial drawdown of Treasury reserves
and a major increase in foreign borrowing. Fortunately, the availability of
well-prepared high priority projects enabled Cameroon to obtain most of the
increased inflow of foreign capital from public aid donors on concessionary
terms. For this reason, as well as the country's low foreign debt before the
1970s, Cameroon's external debt service has remained modest (about 6 percent
of export earnings in 1974).



- 3 -
10.       Although low economic growth over the last four years has jigni-
ficantly reduced import demand, exports maintained a remarkable gro-wth and
profited from higher prices in 1974.   Therefore, the balance of paynents was
never under excessive pressure and the large inflow of foreign cap-ital
remained sufficient to cover the current account deficit.   On the innort
side, the share of refined oil products out of total imports increased from
5 percent in 1973 to 9 percent in 1974. Increases in the price of imported
food was compensated by a reduction in the volume of fcod imports. The terms
of trade are now deteriorating and foreign exchange reserves seem to have
diminished rapidly during the first half of FY75, announcing an era of more
severe balance of payments and public finance problems.
ProsPects and Development Strategy
11.       As a result of the projected deterioration of Cameroon's terms of
trade, exports will play a less dynamic role in economic expansion, while
domestic demand is still too small to take up the slack.   Therefore, overall
growth in the next decade might run well below the rates achieved during the
1960s, in spite of Government efforts to maintain a high volume of publ-c
investment and to develop the country's considerable opportunity for diver-
sification, particularly within the rural sector.
12.       Steady economic growth will depend largely on the extent to which
the Government comes to grips with several structural problems: (i) rural
production (except forestry) suffers from a lack of financial and technical
assistance particularly for small farmers, who produce more than 90 percent
of the country's agricultural output; (ii) in spite of heavy investment in
recent years, the basic transport infrastructure is still insufficient, the
Douala port and the Douala-Yaound6 corridor require increases in capacity and
the road system in general needs better maintenance as well. as adaptation to
traffic growth especially for the development of new agricultural and forestry
2ones; (iii) the education system still is not responding adequately to the
country's changing needs; and (iv) serious economic imbalances persist among
regions, between the towns and countryside, and between modern and traditional
;sectors.
13.       To meet these challenges, the Government must strengthen its ability
to choose, prepare, and implement projects, particularly in the rural sector.
Some progress is being made in this direction. Special planning units are
gradually being established within the technical ministries. A para-public
consulting firm - SEDA - was created under the Planning Ministry to accelerate
project preparation. Commercially oriented public corporations are also
serving to strengthen the project implementation capacity of the public sector.
Nevertheless, further improvements are needed, particularly in the management
of public finance, and in strengthening and coordinating rural development
institutions.



14.       Completing the overall transport infrastructure program already
underway will absorb a high proportion of future public investment. If the
Government succeeds in its present efforts to accelerate preparation and
implementation of projects in the other sectors, particularly for rural
development, future total public investment is likely to exceed US$ 300
million annually (in constant 197Lb dollars) during the Fourth Development
Plan (FY77-81). Budgetary revenues already reach 20 percent of GDP, and
cannot be expected to increase much faster than the economy as a whole,
while surpluses of the stabilization funds are likely to stagnate or even
decline considering the depressed price outlook for most export crops.
On the other hand, current expenditures will have to be stepped up in line
with recently increased public investments in transport, education, and
health, and public debt service charges will grow rapidly. Furthermore,
savings of public enterprises are expected to decline as debt service will
absorb a higher share of their operating surpluses. As a consequence, in
the next five years, public savings after debt service will probably not
exceed 25-30 percent of public investment, as compared with about 4O percent
over the past few years. Hence, Cameroon will have to rely on external
financing for the bulk of its public investment.   Increasing reliance on
foreign borrowing during a period of relatively slow economic growth and
poorer terms of trade will require careful foreign debt management. Assuming,
howvever, that at least 50 percent of foreign public capital inflow will be
on concessionary terms, the foreign debt service ratio could be maintained
below 12 percent by 1980.
15.       Cameroon's ability to make effective use of external resources and
the Government's dedication to development are reasons for increased external
support. With rising debt service absorbing an increasing share of gross
public savings, Cameroon can make only a modest contribution to the financing
of future public investment. To avoid further rapid buildup of debt service,
lenders, including the Bank Group, should provide a large part of their
assistance on concessionary terms. They should also be prepared to finance
a high proportion of project costs including when necessary,a part of local
costs.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPEPATIONS IN CAMEROON
16.       The Bank Group's commitments in Cameroon now amount to US$ 163.6
million and cover thirteen projects:   five in agriculture, five in trans-
portation, two in education, and one in public utilities. Transportation
represents the largest share (55 percent) of our past commitments followed
by agriculture (30 percent). Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans and IDA credits as of April 30, 1975 and includes notes on ongoing
projects. Although delays and setbacks have been occasionally encountered
in the execution of projects, the Government has consistently shown willing-
ness to collaborate with the Bank for the determination and application of
satisfactory solutions.



-5-
17.       The Bank Group's strategy is to support the Government in its
efforts to equip the country with infrastructure, to accelerate rural deve-
lopment, and to increase the efficiency of Cameroon's institutions.
18.       Given sharp traffic increases and the backlDg of required invest-
ments, massive injections of capital will still be necessary in the years
ahead, particularly for the expansion of the port of Douala and improvement
of the Douala - Yacund6 transport corridor. A second Douala port project
will be appraised in mid-1975 and presented to the Executive Directors in
FY76. Future road investment will mainly be for road maintenance and feeder
roads to provide links to local markets and facilitate exploitation of
Cameroon's forests, a major area for future development.
19.       In agriculture, we have been able to help the Government further
diversify production by financing its oil palm and rubber plantations in the
east and west, and rice irrigation and livestock in the north. The cocoa
project approved in September 19Th will modernize cocoa growing by small-
holders and raise rural productivity in an area south and west of the capital.
The proposed rubber project would develop the southwest coastal region.
Identification work for a rural development project in a populated but poor
region in the north is underway. Thus, Bank Group lending to agriculture
supports the Governmient's efforts to modernize the sector and to correct
economic imbalances through the development of this hitherto lagging sector.
In other areas, we have appraised and will soon submit to the Executive
Directors a first small- and medium-scale enterprises project, and have
appraised a third education project with special emphasis on rural education
and training.
20.       In all our projects, we will as in the past include training,
technical assistance, and other provisions necessary for strengthening
institutions and improving sector policies. In addition, through our economic
work we will continue to advise the authorities, at their request, on deve-
lopment questions in general, and on particular matters such as economic
management, problems of urban migration, and manpower development.
21.       Our lending to Cameroon has been closely coordinated with other
donors; in eight of our thirteen projects, financing arrangements have been
either joint or parallel. The French Caisse Centrale de Coop6ration Economique
would join us in financing the proposed rubber project.
22.       Over the second half of the last decade disbursements of foreign aid
amounted to about US$ 40-45 million a year. While at the beginning of this
period 65 percent of this were grants, the proportion of loans has been slowly
increasing as grants declined. A major part of external assistance was pro-
vided by France and concentrated in infrastructure and productive sectors.
The aid giving agencies of the EEC (European Development Fund and European
Investment Bank) directed their lending mainly to agriculture, with infrastruc-
ture in second place. Bank Group disbursements were small during this period.
From 1972 to 1974 disbursements of foreign aid increased to about us$ 60 million
with one third as grants. The Bank Group's share of these inflows amounted



- 6 -
to about 25 percent. Public debt outstanding and disbursed as of December
31, 1974 amounted to US$ 280 million and is projected to reach US$ 1,300
million in 1980. Public debt service as a proportion of export earnings
amounted to 6.0 percent at end 1974 and is projected to reach 12 percent
in 1980. At that time disbursements may be over US$ 250 million with only
15 percent in grants. At present Bank debt outstanding and disbursed
amounts to nearly 11 percent of all public debt and 10 percent of public
debt service. IDA credits outstanding and disbursed amount to nearly
13 percent of public debt outstanding and 0.9 percent of public debt service.
Bank Group lending is expected to account for nearly 12.5 percent of public
debt service in 1980.
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN CAMEROON
23.       Agriculture plays a major role in the Cameroon economy, providing
a livelihood for almost 80 percent of the population and accounting for 32
percent of GDP and 70 percent of the value of exports. Cameroon is largely
self-sufficient in foodstuffs, except for rice and wheat which are being
imported in increasing amounts, and to a lesser extent sugar and meat.
Food crop marketing is largely in the hands of private traders, most of
whom operate over small areas and with limited turnover. As a result,
although production is keeping slightly ahead of population growth, major
urban centers are experiencing increasing foodstuff supply and distribution
problems.
24.       Production for export has so far been the most dynamic part of the
agricultural sector; output of the main export cr ops--cocoa, coffee and
cotton--increased by about 5 percent annually during the late 1960s.
However, growth slowed down in the early 1970s as a consequence of droughts
and the ageing of plantations. Marketing of export crops is reasonably well
organized. The Government licenses private exporters and fixes guaranteed
producer prices through Stabilization Funds in the Eastern part of Cameroon,
and a Marketing Board in the West; these agencies are now being merged.
25.       The Government's capacity for project preparation and implementa-
tion in the rural sector is weak. Recently, however, the Government has
taken a variety of measures aimed at creating stronger and more effective
regional or crop development agencies, and plans to increase substantially
investment in agriculture. While rural investment accounted for less than
15 percent of total capacity outlay during the Third Development Plan
(FY72-76), agricultural and livestock projects may absorb about 20 or 25
percent of the Fourth Plan currently being prepared.
26.       The agriculture sector can be divided in two major subsectors:
traditional agriculture and industrial plantations. The tra ditional
subsector, accounts for about 90 percent of agricultural output. It comprises
some 950,000 smallholders cultivating plots averaging about two hectares
each, using family labor. Smallholders produce fooderops for subsistence and
for the local market, and cocoa, coffee, cotton and groundnuts for export.



- 7 -
The industrial plantation subsector comprises several large Govermment-owned
and a few private (foreign-owned) industrial estates producing principally
palm oil and rubber.  CANDEV in the West and SOCAPAIM in the East are the
more important of these plantation corporations.
27.       Prospects for developing smallholder agriculture are promising.
Development of this sector has been thus far hampered by the weakness of
extension and credit services. Agricultural credit consists largely of
short-term marketing loans for the main export crops and production credit
for participants in specific export crop development programs. The Fonds
National de Developpement Rural (FONADER) was recently created to exoand
and coordinate rural development programs and agricultural credit in close
association with extension services. However, its establishment is too
recent to judge its effectiveness.
28.       The long run prospects for estate crops are good.   Over the past
few years, export prices have been favorable and profit margins have increased.
Palm oil production, including that from wild palm, is expected to increase
from 30,000 tons in 1973 to over 100,000 tons by 1985, mostly for the local
market. Rubber will also increase substantially from the 1973/74 level of
17,000 tons.
29.       Large-scale industrial estates are an effective method for beginning
development of large and sparsely populated areas, with good agricultural
potential, such as the Mbandjok area in the central savannah and the Kribi
area in the southwest where the proposed rubber project would be located.
Industrial estates can initially stimulate migration of laborers and their
families from densely populated areas in the West and the North; once
established, these estates would become focal points for satellite small-
holders growing food and plantation crops. The result would be a balanced
development of these newly opened areas.
30.       The Bank's strategy in the rural sector aims at developing both
industrial plantations and smallholder schemes.   In the past, Bank Groun
lending to CA4D1EV (FY67) and SOCApAIJq (FY69) was followed by loans or
credits for rice irrigation (FY72), a livestock project (FY74), and a cocoa
p'roject (FY75). The proposed rubber project is expected to be followed by
rural development projects in FY77 and FY78.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background and Purpose
31.       The Government of Cameroon has requested the assistance of the
Association and the French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE)
in fitancing a rubber estate in the southwest of the country.   The project
was prepared by the Soci6te Africaine Forestiere et Agricole--Cameroun
(SAFACAM) and appraised in November/December 1974.



-0O 
32.       The appraisal report, Appraisal of the Ni6te Rubber Estate Project,
No. 716a-CM dated May 20, 1975 is being circulated separately to the Executive
Directors. A Credit and Project Summary is in Annex III of this report.
Negotiations for a credit were held in Washington in April 1975 with a
Cameroonian delegation headed by His Excellency, Mr. Francois-Xavier Tchoungui,
Ambassador of the United Republic of Cameroon to Washington. CCCE was also
represented at negotiations.
33.       Initially,the Government asked IDA and CCCE to consider financing
the establishment of a 15,000 ha rubber estate. It was agreed by the
lending agencies, however, to confine the initial project to a 5,800 ha
estate which would be large enough to constitute an economic unit. Since
the Government sees this initial project as a first step toward the larger
venture, the financial and economic data in the appraisal report show the pro-
jected results both of the proposed project and of a larger (15,000 ha) estate.
3h.       The further ques-tion arose of whether funds should now be committed
for the complete development of the 5,800 ha estate over the full period of 12 years
which is required to bring this first-phase project into full production. Taking
into account the prospective rate of inflation and the high price contingencies
which would be necessary if the project was to be fully funded over such a
long period of time, it was decided to present a project for financing the
necessary development of the estate for a period of only 5 years. 'Tnis would
encompass the planting of 5,800 ha of rubber as well as the preparatory worlc
for subsequent development, involving an expenditure of US$ 18.3 million (net
of taxes and contingencies) equivalent during this initial period. The com-
pletion of the project would take a further 7 years and some US$ 11 million
(net of taxes and contingencies). The Government has agreed to assume responsi-
bility for providing, or causing to be provided, these funds (Section 3.01 (f)
of the Development Credit Agreement). At a later stage, however, the World
Bank Group and CCCE may consider financing either the remaining development
of the 5,800 ha, or further expansion of the estate, on the basis of the
preparatory work financed during the first phase.
35.       The project would also provide for preparation of a major long-term
development plan for the southwest region.   In outline, this plan would aim
at developing some 100,000 ha or more of nuclear estate and outgrowqer com-
plexes, over some 25 years, in a region that is now sparsely populated and
unexploited but suitable for a range of tree crops including rubber.
Project Description
36.       The project comprises the first phase of development--1975/76
through 1979/80--of a large rubber estate. It would include:
(a) clearing of about 5,800 ha and planting them with high yielding
rubber; preparation of land for a further 1,700 ha to be
planted in 1981; and maintenance of the 5,800 ha   of plantings
for the duration of the five year project development period;



- 9 -
(b) conducting establishment and yield trials with different
clones of rubber and agronomic research;
(c) constructing housing, health, education, and the social
facilities for about 3,000 families living on the rubber
estate; and the building of service roads for the rubber
estate;
(d) establishing a commissariat to ensure food supplies to
estate employees, and also to supervise trials with food-
crops;
(e) establishing and staffing a state-owned company to own and
operate the estate; and employing a suitably qualified firm
to:
(i) manage the new company,
(ii) prepare a follow-up project, including the continua-
tion of pedological and topographical prospection,
(iii) train Cameroonians at all levels of responsibility on
the estate; and
(f) preparing a master plan for the development of the Kribi
region which emphasizes the production of perennial crops.
Project Execution
37.       The estate would be owned and operated by a Government-owned
corporation Hev6a-Cameroun (HEVECAM). The Government recognizes that it
will take time for Cameroonians to be trained for senior management positions
in the rubber industry. Therefore, HEVECAM would employ the management
services of SAFAGAM, a Cameroonian estate-operating company which itself is
affiliated with Societ6 Financiere (SOCFIN), a well-known international
corporation specializing in tropical estate production and sales. The
Association has reviewed and approved a draft of the management contract,
whose signing is a condition of credit effectiveness. HEVECAM's senior
management would comprise a Director General, a Technical Manager, an
Administrative Manager and an Industrial Manager whose qualifications,
experience and terms and conditions of employment would be satisfactory to
IDA (Section 3.01 b of Project Agreement).
Cost Estimates and Financial Arrangements
38.       The project cost is estimated at US$ 28.5 million including uS$ 4.5
million of taxes and US$ 0.8 million of corporate fees. The foreign exchange
component would be about US$ 16.6 million, or 72 percent of total cost net of
taxes and fees. Total cost includes physical contingencies and provisions for
price increases amounting to 42 percent of the base cost estimates, which are
at end-1974 prices.



- 10 -
39.       The proposed IDA credit would be for US$ 16 million, made to the
United Republic of Cameroon on standard terms, and would cover about 69
percent of the total cost of the project net of taxes and fees. CCCE would
loan US$ 4.45 million equivalent to Government, for a term of 20 years,
including 10 years of grace, with interest at 5.5 percent; the CCCE loan
would finance 19 percent of total costs. Government would finance the
remaining 12 percent of total costs. About US$ 0.9 million of the proceeds
of the IDA credit would be used to finance the preparation of the Master
plan for the development of the Kribi area. The remainder (us$ 15.1 million)
together with the CCCE and Government contributions to HEVECAM would be made
available as equity (45 percent) and sub-loan (55 percent). The total
equity contribution of US$ 12.2 million would consist of US$ 3.5 million IDA
funds, us$ 7.7 million Government funds and US$ 1.0 million Caisse loan
funds. The sub-loan of US$ 14.8 million would consist of US$ 11.6 million
IDA funds and US$ 3.2 million of CCCE loan funds, and would be made by the
Government to HEVECAM under a Project Financing Agreement that is a condition of
effectiveness of the Credit. The proposed subloan would be for 30 years at a
5-1/2 percent interest rate; no interest would be charged during the 15 year
grace period. The above financial arrangements reflect the fact that in
rubber projects yields only begin in year 8 and do not reach their maximum
before year 18. The arrangements would enable HEVECAM to meet its operating
costs as well as debt service obligations and to build up adequate cash
balances out of self generated funds.
40.       Some preparatory work, involving advance contracting and amounting
to a maximum of US$ 0.4 million, had to be initiated prior to Board Presenta-
tion since, otherwise, a whole year of planting would have been lost. IDA
and CCCE would finance such expenditures retroactively to the extent that
eligible payments are made before signing.
Procurement
141.      Procurement would be through international competitive bidding
(ICB) under IDA guidelines except for items mentioned below and individual
contracts not exceeding US$ 60,000, which would be let locally under com-
petitive bidding procedures advertised locally that would be agreed with IDA.
Goods manufactured in Cameroon and in countries which are a party to Central
African States Customs Union (UDEAC) would be allowed a preference equal to
the lower of (a) 15 percent or (b) applicable duties, and prequalified
Cameroonian contractors a preference of 7-1/2 percent. To the extent that
land clearing is not done by force account, it would be done manually under
contracts awarded on the basis of procurement procedures described above.
Otherwise, clearance would be mechanized and carried out by force account,
as would road building and other construction. Assuming that land clearance is
mechanized, goods and services subject to ICB--largely machinery, vehicles and
equipment and fertilizers--are estimated to cost Us$5.0 million. This com-
paratively small amount reflects the large component of project costs that
comprises labor and management. A minimum amount of land-clearing equipment,
costing about US$ 0.38 million, has already been ordered under ICB, with IDA
and CCCE approval because delivery is expected to take 12 months and otherwise
the project might have been delayed. Arrangements for the provision of
ma..gement services by SAFACAM would be acceptable to IDA.

¼2.       Disbursements by IDA and OCCE would be in the proportions 56:17.
Proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed to cover 58 percent of
expenditures of the following items: (a) civil works and plantations--
US$ b.8 million; (b) equipment and materials--2.2 million; (c) administra-
tion--US$ 2.5 million; (d) food crop development--US$ 300,000; (e) technical
assistance--US$ 580,000; (f) preparation of a follow-up project and related
studies--US$ 120,000; and (g) master plan--US$ 700,000.
Benefits and Justification
43.       The project would contribute to meet important Government deve-
lopment objectives. First, at peak production, the completed 5,800 ha
estate would produce 13,000 tons of rubber (71 percent of Cameroon's
present output), a level that could be sustained for more than 20 years
without major replacements. Net foreign exchange earnings of about US$ 7.0
million would be generated each year, decreasing Cameroonts still heavy
reliance on two major export crops--cocoa and coffee, whose export prospects
are limited. Second, the scheme, being labor intensive, would provide
secure employment to about 3,000 employees and their families--10-12,000
people in total--most of them from the north, and considerable improvement
in their standards of living. Satellite food crop production, trade and
transport activities would also develop. Third, the project would help
spread the benefits of development more evenly among regions by opening up
an area with good potential for successful establishment of other estate
and smallholder plantations which would ultimately form a whole new agro-
industrial complex in the hinterland of the port of Kribi.
L4.       The economic rate of return on the project is estimated at
14 percent. Sensitivity analysis indicates that a cost increase of 10
percent would reduce the rate to 12.5 percent; a 25 percent increase would
reduce it to about 11 percent. A corbined 10 percent increase in costs and
10 percent decrease in benefits would decrease the return to 11 percent.
A combination of 20 percent cost increase and 20 percent benefit decrease
would reduce the rate to nearly 8 percent.
45.       The above calculations are based on the assumption that:  either
(a) the proposed project is planned and executed as the first phase of a
15,000 ha estate, in accordance with Government's present intentions; or
(b) that the estate is not enlarged beyond the 5,800 ha covered by the
proposed project and that the decision to do this will be taken early
enough, say in the first or second year, to enable the phasing of develop-
ment to be planned and executed in the most economic way. In both cases
the rate of return is the same to the nearest percentage point, since there
are only minor economies of scale in the development of such large areas.
46.       It is possible that changes in market prospects may lead to a
decision to restrict the size of the estate to 5,800 ha only in the Lth or
5th year of the project, by which time some investments would have been made
in anticipation of an expansion and therefore earlier than would have been



- 12 -
economical. In these circumstances the rate of return would be about 11
percent. Since the timing of the decision on the ultimate size of the
estate has thus an impact on the rate of return of the project, Government,
CCCE and the Association intend to review this matter regularly.
47.       The project would entail the risk that, as a pioneering venture
in an unexploited region, there can be no certainty that a satisfactory
labor force would be created. It is highly probable that labor from
overpopulated areas would be attracted by the regular wages offered by the
estate. The danger is that, if proper measures are not taken to make their
lives satisfactory, they would return to their home villages. The project
thus provides for the housing, health and education facilities that would
be the best safeguard against such risk.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
48.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the United
Republic of Cameroon and the Association, the draft Project Agreement
between the Association and Soci6t6 Hevea-Cameroun (HEVECAM), the Recommend-
ation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the
Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving the pro-
posed credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
49.       Features of the Development Credit and Project Agreements of
special interest are referred to in paragraphs 37, 40, and 41 of this
Report.
50.       Conditions of effectiveness include:   (i) execution of the Manage-
ment Service and Technical Assistance Contracts by HEVECAM (Section 5.01 (c)
of the Development Credit Agreement), (ii) payment of Borrower's initial
equity contribution to HEVECAM, (iii) conditions of disbursement under the
Caisse Centrale Loan Agreement have been fulfilled, and (iv) execution of the
Project Financing Agreement.
51.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART 1T - RECOMNbENDATION
52.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION J
Cr. No. 100, Ln. No. 490  CAMDEV Prolect: US$ 11 million Credit of March
28. 1967; Closing Date: June 30. 1972 and
UTS 7 million Loan to CAMDEV of same date;
ClosinR Date: June 30. 1977 (Original
Closing Date: December 31. 1974).
The original planting and replanting program of 11,500 ha of various
tree crops was reduced by 1,000 ha of tea; the revised program is substantially
complete and has been satisfactorily carried out. The management structure
was recently improved. Increases in commodity prices, coupled with effective
Government supported economy measures, have led to a sound liquid position,
in place of previous deficits. The financial prospects are good. A period
of consolidation is now required to improve production efficiency and cost
control. For this purpose, new investment is needed in more estate roads
and additional equipment for the oil and rubber mills. Therefore, the
closing date of the loan was recently extended to 6-30-77.
Ln. No. 593 and SD Ln. No. 886   Oil Palm Proiect: US$ 7.9 million Loan
to Sopame of kAril 15~. 1969; glosing Date:
December 31. 1976 and US$ 1.7 million
Su.pplermental Loan of Anril 9. 1973:
Closing Date: June 30. 19790.
The project is progressing satisfactorily. The establishment of
8,500 ha of oil palms will be completed in 1975 with the planting of the
final 900 ha. One of the two mills has been completed; the second is
expected to be commissioned in May 1975. In order to improve labor
conditions, it is proposed to expand and improve the estate housing
program. Because substantial production only starts in 1975 some short-
term borrowing may be needed to avoid delaying this program. Financial
prospects are good, however. Yields are in line with appraisal projections
and palm oil prices are higher.
i./ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weak-
nesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 60LL Water Supply Proiect: US$ 5 million Loan to SNE of June 2.
1969- Closing Date: December 31L 1974 (Original Closing
Date: May 31, 1972)..
This project was completed ahead of schedule with substantial savings
which have been approved for investment in further water distribution works;
however, disbursements lagged due to the strong working capital position of
the Borrower and the closing date was postponed three times in order to allow
remaining funds to be disbursed. SNEC and Government (Guarantor) have accepted
the Bank's proposal for closure of the loan as of December 31, 1974 and the
Bank has cancelled the unused balance of US$ 70,000.
Cr. No. 161 First Education Project; US$ 10.5 million Credit of September
23, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1975 (Original Closing
Date: June 30, 1974).
Construction of the project schools is about 12 months late
due to delays in selecting the consultants, reaching agreement on schedules
of accommodation, revising the bidding documents, starting construction works
for which overpriced initial bids on 16 schools had to be cancelled, and
awarding contracts. Project management has improved and progress is now
generally satisfactory. There are however some additional delays in
equipment procurement. The estimated final total project cost is within
appraisal estimates in CFA Francs, but about US$ 1.2 million equivalent was
lost due to the fluctuations in the US dollar. The technical assistance
program is 30 months behind schedule due to a slow selection process and the
closing date will need to be extended from December 31, 1975 to June 30, 1977.
Cr. No. 180, Ln. No. 663  First Highway Project; US$ 7 million Credit of March
27, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 197h and
US$ 12 million Loan of same date; Closing Date:
December 31, 1975; (Original Closing Date:
December 31, 1973; first postponement: December
31, 1974).
The Tiko-Victoria road was completed satisfactorily in April 1973.
The first section of the N'Gaoundere-Garoua road was completed in March
1974. The other two sections will not be finished before June 1975, i.e.
one year behind schedule, since the contractor only recently finished
repairing damages that occured during the last rainy season, and has
completed construction of 110 km out of the total of 178 km. Cost over-
runs are estimated at US$ 5.1 million, of which 4O % is due to currency
realignment, 15 % to inflation, and 15 % to quantity increase.

Ln. No. 687 Railway ProLect; U§S 5.2 million Loan to REGIFERCAM of June 9,
1970; Cloam   Date:  June  0 19      IOinal Closing Date:
June 30. 1974).
Project execution has been satisfactory for track renewal work and
delivery of motive power and rolling stock. Unforeseen technical difficulties,
such as extremely bad subsoil conditions, made lengthy studies necessary before
selecting the site and the optimum design of the new railway bridge at Japoma,
near Douala. Bids were called at the completion of studies and results
showed that funds of Loan No. 687 would be insufficient to cover the full cons-
truction costs of the new bridge. Supplementary financing has been provided
under the recently approved Second Railway Project. The closing date has been
extended to June 30, 1975 to permit disbursement for Japoma bridge.
Cr. No. 229  Douala Port Project; US$ 1.5 million Credit of January lL,
1971;_Closing Date; December 1. 127     _Original Cosing Date:
June 2dV 197D)'
The Douala Pbrt. Project commenced in July 1972 and physical work
under the Credit was satisfactorily completed in November 197. Credit
covenants and undertakings given during Credit negotiations have been
reasonably fulfilled, but financial targets have not been achieved in
recent years. Remedial measures are now being urged by the Association.
Cr. No. 302  SEMRY Rice ProJect; US$ 3.7 million Credit of ApEig 26. 1972:
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
The project started in mid 1972 and is progressing satisfactorily.
Implementation is largely on schedule. However, the devaluation of the US
dollar and additional works have increased costs by about 36 percent. The
Government, CCCE and FAC are financing the cost overrun.
Cr. No. 320 Second Education Project; US$ 9 million Credit of June 28,
1972; Closing Date: June 30. 1979.
Due to delays in selecting the consulting architects, the date
of effectiveness specified in the Credit Agreement, October 2, 1972, had
to be postponed to February 27, 1973. Due to difficulties in selecting
the sites for the construction of two project institutions, and the need
to revise the sketch and preliminary drawings, the design period will
be extended by about nine months, but no extension of the closing date
of June 30, 1979, is expected. The project is generally well managed,
but will face severe cost overruns due to the accelerated price increases
which have occured since 1973.   Detailed proposals for refinancing will
be worked out by the mission that appraised the Third Education Project
in February/March 1975.

Cr. No. 422, Ln. No. 935  Second Highway ProJect:  US$ 2L million Credit of
SeDtember 26. 1973; Closing Date:  December 31,
1978 and US$ 24 mil1ion Loan of same date; Cl0sin,
Date:  December 3. 1978.
Because of inflation and the price escalation clause, bids for the
construction of the three roads were 35 % higher than the appraisal estimates
and costs are continuing to climb. The Government has awarded construction
contracts for all roads at the original bid price. On the basis of new estimates
of inflation rates, the total cost of the project is now estimated at US$ 112
million with a foreign cost component of US$ 76 million. The Bank Group is
considering proposing an increase in its contribution to the financing of this
project.
Ln. No. 283 Livestock Project: US$ 11.6 million Loan of MaM 14. 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
Initial implementation is satisfactory except for some delays in
release of funds by the Government. Staffing of the agencies concerned is
progressing well. In February 1975, Consultants were to be invited to submit
proposals for the design of slaughter plants. Disbursements are slow but are
expected to accelerate and conform to appraisal estimates in 1976.
Ln. No. 1038 Second Railway Project; US$ 16.0 million Loan to REGIFERCAM of
SePtembpr 14j JI71 ; Cosing Date:  December 31. 1977.
Procurement of main project items is well underway; track
material is being delivered and rolling stock should be available by end
1975.Problems were encountered in the construction of foundations
for the Japoma Bridge. Proposals for the management consulting services
have been invited, and agreement has been reached in principle on the
terms of reference for the Douala-Yaoande transport corridor study.
Due to the present world slump in the timber market and a recent subs-
tantial increase in staff costs, REGIFERCAM will have difficulty in attaining
the financial covenants included in the Loan Agreement.
Ln. No. 1039  Cocoa Project; US$ 6.5 million Loan of-September 18, 1974;
Closing Date:June 30s 1981.
The loan became effective on February 26, 1975. There has been good
progress in the establishment of the project's management structure as well as
in the preparation of field development, which is due to commence in May 1975,
and in the training program.   The procurement of material  to start the feeder
road program has been delayed because of slow progress in establishing the
organization to carry it out, but this problem has now been solved with the
signature of a satisfactory contract betw^reen the project authority and the
Public Roads Department.

CAX&ROQN - NIETE RUBBER ESTATE PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                     United Republic of Cameroon
Beneficiarj:                  Hevea-cameroun (HEVECAM)
AEEount:                      US$ 16 million equivalent
Terms:                        Standard IDA terms
Relending terms:              About US$ 0.9 million of the proceeds of the
IDA credit would be used to finance the pre-
paration of the Master Plan for the develop-
ment of the Kribi area. The remainder (US$
15.1 million)together with the CCCE and Govern-
ment contributions would be made available to
HEVECAM as equity (45 %) and loan capital (55%).
The equity contribution of US$ 12.2 million
would consist of US$ 3.5 million IDA funds,
US$ 7.7 million Government funds and US$ 1.0
million CCCE loan funds. The sub-loan of US$
14.8 million would consist of US$ 11.6 million
IDA funds and US$ 3.2 million of CCCE loan
funds. The proposed sub-loan would be for 30
years at a 5-1/2 % interest rate; no interest
would be charged during the 15 year grace period.
The above financial arrangements reflect the
fact that in rubber projects yields only begin
in year 8. The arrangements would enable HEVECAM
to meet its operating costs as well as debt service
obligations and to build up adequate cash balances
out of self-generated funds.
roject Descr-iption:          The project, comprising the first phase of develop-
ment -- 1975/76 - 1979/80 -- of a large govern-
ment program in the Kribi area, would involve:
planting 5,800 ha of high-yielding rubber, land
preparation for a further 1,700 ha, and maintenance
of plantings during the project development period;

conducting establishment and yield trials with
different clones of rubber and agronoeic
research; constructing housing, health and
education facilities for plantation personnel,
and service roads for the estate; establishing
a commissariat to ensure food supplies to estate
employees, and supervising trials with food
crops; establishing and staffing HEVECAM to own
and operate the estate; training Cameroonians
in rubber production; preparing a follow-up
project, including the continuation of pedolo-
gical end topographical prospection, and a master
plan which emphasizes perennial crop development in
the Kribi area.

Procurement
Arrangements:         Procurement would be through international competitive
bidding (ICB) under IDA guidelines except for items men-
tioned below and individual contracts not exceeding
US$ 60,000, which would be let locally under competitive
bidding procedures advertised locally that would be
agreed with IDA. Goods manufactured in Cameroon and in
countries which are a party to Central African States
CGstoms Union (UDEAC) would be allowed a preference
equal to the lower of (a) 15 % or (b) applicable duties
and prequalified Cameroonian contractors a preference of
7-1/2 %. To the extent that land clearing is not done
by force account, it would be done manually under contracts
awarded on the basis of procurement procedures described
above. Otherwise, clearance would be mechanized and
carried out on force account, as would road building and
other construction. Assuming that land clearance is
mechanized, goods and services subject to IGB -- largely
machinery, vehicles and equipment and fertilizers -- are
estimated to cost US$ 5 million. This comparatively small
amount reflects the large component of project costs that
comprises labor and management. A minimum amount of
land-clearing equipment, costing US$ 0.38 million, has
already been ordered under ICB, with IDA and CCCE approval,
because delivery is expected to take 12 months and other-
wise the project might have been delayed. Arrangements
for the provision of management services by SAFACAM would
be acceptable to IDA.

Technical Assistance:   SAFACAM, which is a suitably qualified firm, would be
employed to manage newly created HEVECAM,conduct field
trials, train Cameroonians in rubber production, prepare
a follow-up project; and Government would prepare a
regional development plan with the aid of consultants.
Rate of Return:         The economic rate of return is estimated at 14 percent.
