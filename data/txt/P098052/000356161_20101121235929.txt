SUMMARY

The proposed changes in the Aceh Forest and Environment Project (AFEP) are to: a) incorporate a
revised results framework for grants to both entities that implement the project (Leuser International
Foundation (LIF)/TF056197 and Fauna & Flora International (FFI)/TF056198); and b) reallocate
more than 10% of the category allocations in the grant agreement with Fauna & Flora
International/TF056198.

Revision of the results framework was recommended during both the project mid-term review and
the Multi Donor Fund mid-term review. The implementing entities developed and are currently
reporting against a revised results framework that is more logical, measurable and reflective of
project objectives. There is now a need to formally incorporate this framework in the grant
agreements. A copy of the updated framework is attached in Annex 1 along with the draft
amendments to the grant agreements with for LIF and FFI.

FFI has requested that an amount greater than 10% of a budget category be reallocated to allow the
project to expand ongoing activities in the field of community organization; training of teams and
support community-based forest monitoring against illegal logging and poaching; forest and agroforestry
education and training; and support to local partners in the preservation of livelihood from human/wildlife
conflicts; and project management. The draft amendment to the grant agreement for FFI is attached as
Annex 2.

The option of project extension was raised during the AFEP mid-term review and was developed and
endorsed during subsequent supervision missions. Extension will enable the implementing entities to
complete critical remaining tasks while prudently expending the remaining resources in their grants.
The extension request has the support of the provincial government, the Finance Ministry and the
MDF (still to be obtained). The request was approved by the Country Director on June 14, 2010 (see
letters in Annex 3).

PROJECT STATUS

Project progress continues to be satisfactory. This assessment is based on: a) the most recent
quarterly progress reports which cover the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010; b) the
key performance indicators for the project results framework covering the period 2006-2009; and c)
follow-up by the implementing agencies to the findings and recommendations of the previous
supervision mission. Progress toward achieving the Project Development Objective (PDO) is rated
as satisfactory. Relevant ratings are summarized below:
Overall Implementation Progress            Satisfactory
Project Management                         Satisfactory
Financial Management                       FFI: Moderately satisfactory
                                           LIF: Moderately unsatisfactory
Counterpart Funding                        Not applicable
Procurement                                FFI: Moderately satisfactory
                                           LIF: Moderately unsatisfactory
Monitoring and Evaluation                  Moderately satisfactory



PROPOSED CHANGES

Revised Results Framework and Indicators

A revised results framework was completed and adopted during the October 2009 supervision
mission and is presented in Annex 1. The framework has benefited from inputs by the MDF
Secretariat and the World Bank mission as well as the start-up of a project-wide monitoring and
evaluation officer. It represents a slight modification of the logical framework that was
suggested in the AFEP Mid-term Review. Adjustments have been made to reflect changing
realities, e.g. the substitution of BAPPENAS for the BRR, as well as a more realistic view of
what the project can accomplish during its duration. Since the October 2009 mission, the
implementing entities' Project Coordination Unit shared by the two implementing entities has
been able to generate baseline data and annual indicators for each year of project implementation
according to the revised framework. This includes the key PDO indicator on deforestation.
They are now updating the indicators on a quarterly basis.

Reallocation

One of the project's two implementing entities, FFI, has requested a reallocation that amounts to
more than 10% of a budget category in order to expand and consolidate successful ongoing
community based natural resources management and monitoring activities. The requested
reallocation has the endorsement of the AFEP Steering Committee, the provincial government,
and the Ministry of Finance. The draft reallocation letter is presented in Annex 2.

The reallocation will result in transferring resources from some activities listed under Part B.2b
of the Project (provisions of facilities and equipment for environmental education and awareness
development of environmental and conservation education and awareness programs, and
community development initiative ... including provision of facilities and equipment) to Part A.2
of the Project (strengthening forest monitoring and protection systems and procedures). One of
the activities under Part B.2, education and livelihood, will be also strengthened. Overall,
Project Part B.2 will be reduced in size in that a conservation and awareness center initially
planned will not be built as decided at the project Mid Term Review.

The proposed changes reflect the adjustments in activities, previously agreed by the World Bank,
for delivering essential forest management and community livelihood activities. The reallocation
would result in an increase in `Consultant Services' and in `Workshops and Meeting' to enable
the completion of FFI's forest protection work (involving community rangers, conservation
response units and law enforcement training), education curriculum (with the Education
Department) and tree nurseries (with local communities/Mukim). Also from the `Workshops and
Meeting' category, additional funds are needed to enable the completion of capacity building
that relates to safeguarding local livelihoods from human-wildlife conflict, a principal livelihood
threat. All of the above work is in-line with the project's sustainability strategy and will enable
the further transfer of roles and responsibilities to local partners. The table in the following page
sets out the proposed reallocation on a category-by-category basis.

An expansion of project support to REDD during the final stage of project implementation had
been initially envisaged and initial agreements had been obtained from the AFEP Steering
Committee, the provincial government, and the Ministry of Finance. There has been however a
change of plans in September 2010 due to the fact that an external investor has offered to assist
the Government of Aceh in REDD-related activities.

Safeguard compliance of ongoing project and adequacy of project's safeguard instruments. The
Project triggers six safeguards (Environmental Assessment, Natural Habitat, Involuntary
Resettlement, Indigenous People, Forests and Cultural Property). A process framework for
complying with Bank policies on Indigenous People and Involuntary Resettlement is the main
safeguard instrument used by the project. This instrument is being expanded to become an
Environmental and Social Management Plan at the time of restructuring. The Project's ISDS is
also being updated and sent to the Infoshop along with the ESMF.

The project has been operating for 4 years and has spent the vast majority of its resources (over
90%). Its focus has been on (i) community organization and education, (ii) spatial planning; (iii)
capacity building of various institutions; (iv) strengthening regulatory frameworks in favor of
conservation; (v) issuing small grants for environmentally friendly activities; (vi) creating
framework for sustainability at various levels; (vii) helping prevent, detect and prosecute illegal
logging and poaching. The project has also assisted the Government of Aceh in organizing
surveys and participate in meeting and events related to setting up of a REDD demonstration site.
No further support to this activity is envisaged in this ending phase of the project as a donor has
been found to finance the full set of Ulu Masen REDD activities. Since its beginning, the project
has been engaged in helping the GoA authorities enforce the forest law, through a series of
capacity building and community organization efforts. The project is also helping contain illegal
conversion of forest and peat lands into rubber or oil plantations. To this end, it supports the
Government in the review of the legality of concessions issued in the past and which are at times
illegal.

All activities proposed in the reallocation are in line with the original project development
objectives. The proposed reallocation of the resources administered by FFI will enable to
consolidate activities that are already part of the original project.
There have been eight supervision missions to the project, three of which included social
expertise and seven included environmental expertise. No significant environmental and social
issues have been documented by supervision missions. And no significant environmental and
social issues are outstanding at the time of restructuring. The proposed budget re-allocation does
not include new types of activities which would require a change in the original environmental
categorization (B). And there is no major change in the project which would alter the overall
project risk or demand the preparation of new safeguard instruments. The project has a system to
collect complaints and feedback from project beneficiaries and the public at large for which it
maintains records and issues responses.

         Extension and proposed workplan
         Both implementing entities requested in May 2010 that AFEP and their grant agreements be
         extended at no cost for one year so that the project would end on June 30, 2011 rather than June 30,
         2010. The no-cost extension request was approved by the AFEP Steering Committee, the provincial
         government, the Ministry of Finance, and the MDF. Extension letters were issued by the Country
         Director on June 14, 2010 (see Annex ) and the project has been formally extended. The rationale
         for the extension is to allow the project to achieve its objectives while spending its remaining
         resources prudently. This includes to: i) complete the Ulu Masen management center network; ii)
         train teams and support community-based forest monitoring against illegal logging and
         poaching; iii) pay for maintenance to Ultra Light planes; iv) complete forest education
         curriculum in nine additional schools; iv) complete agroforestry training; v) support local
         partners in the preservation of livelihood from human/wildlife conflicts; and vi) project
         management. More information is contained in the workplan presented in the following page.

  Forest cover is used as a proxy for the delivery of environmental services. Direct measurement of environmental services over
the timeframe of the project is unrealistic.

  Target areas: are selected by the IE's based on conservation values and threat levels. Primary target areas are those with high
conservation and high threat values.

  In the Ulu Masen area, the IE usually works at the Mukim level (usually multiple Gampong), while in the Leuser Ecosystem the
IE works at the Gampong level.
