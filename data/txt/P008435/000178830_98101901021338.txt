THE HUNGARIAN PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT OF THE
GRAIN STORAGE AND MECHANIZATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Government of the People's Republic of Hungary has requested
assistance from the Bank in financing a portion of its 5-Year (1981-85)
National Development Plan for grain storage and mechanization of on-farm grain
production activities. The project, which was identified during a Bank
economic mission in May/June 1982, was prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture
and Food Industry (MEM) with the guidance of a Bank mission in October 1982.
Field appraisal took place in November/December 1982, by a mission consisting
of Messrs. R. Hunt, S. Bhatia, J. Ijichi, F. Lucca and P. Van der Veen (Bank)
and Messrs. E. Hudek and E. Rodda (Consultants).
1.02     The proposed project is the first to be financed by the Bank in the
agricultural sector in Hungary, which joined the Bank in July 1982. The
Bank's lending strategy is based on the findings of the economic mission in
May/June 1982 LI and subsequent sector related missions which helped the
Hungarian authorities to prepare this proposed project.
II. THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR /2
A. Role of Agriculture in the Hungarian Economy
Overview
2.01     In the Hungarian economy, in which trade accounts for over 40% of
GDP, the performance of agriculture is of major significance. In 1981,
agriculture products accounted for 25% of all exports, and 73% of all
agricultural exports were sold for convertible currency and constituted 33% of
all convertible currency exports. Therefore, expansion of agriculture would
directly contribute to improving the external equilibrium of the economy, a
critical objective of economic policy.
/1 Economic Developments and Reforms in Hungary. Report No. 4174-HU, World
Bank, March 21, 1983.
/2 For a more detailed description of the prospects and problems facing the
Sector, see Project Implementation File (PIF), Annex 1.



2.02     In 1981, agriculture accounted for 16.5% of national income and
provided about 21% of all employment. In the same year, it accounted for 15%
of investment and 12% of total fixed assets. The sector generally provides
the country's grain requirements, with surpluses for export, and provides for
self-sufficiency in all of the country's other food requirements, and the raw
materials required for a number of agriculture based processing industries.
Its share of national income has shown a gradual decline as is characteristic
of the more mature economies. Between 1970 and 1980 the total gross output
grew at an annual average rate of 5%; in the same period, agricultural output
grew at an annual rate of a little over 3%.
Population and Employment
2.03     Between 1960 and 1981, while the population of Hungary increased from
10.0 million to 10.7 million, an annual increase of 0.35%, the rural
population decreased from 6.0 million to 5.0 million. The proportion of
people living in the rural areas declined from 60% in 1960 to 46% in 1981.
Currently the sector employs 21% of the workforce.
Natural Resources and Land Use
2.04     The extensive low lying plains of Hungary are potentially one of
Europe's main grain producing areas. The soils are relatively good and the
moderate continental climate is generally suitable for agricultural
production. Average precipitation is 500-600 mm, but within a wide range of
200 mm to 1,000 mm and the occurance of 2 to 3 successive years of drought or
excessive summer rains that are disruptive to crop production. Out of a
national total of 9.3 million ha, 6.6 million ha (71%) are used for various
types of agricultural production. Of the agricultural total, arable land
(mainly grain) accounts for 71% (4.7 million ha), pasture 14% (1.0 million
ha), meadowland 5.0% (0.3 million ha), vineyards and orchards 5% (0.3 million
ha), and gardens 4% (0.25 million ha). Five main types of soils are present
in Hungary. Brown forest soils, with 41% of the land area, are most common.
Chernozems, the most fertile soils, account for 25% of the land. Other types
of soils are alluvial, sandy, alkaline, and marshy soils. In general, soils
tend to be acidic; 40% have a pH of below 6.
Production Structure
2.05     Land area, use and tenure are summarized in Table 2.1 below.
Socialist agriculture, combining state and cooperative sectors, is responsible
for 95% of the total area. Average farm size is very large in both sectors:
the range is from 2,000 to 20,000 ha. Many are highly integrated operations
and also engage in non-agricultural commercial activities (light industry,
construction and services). Irrigated area is small, averaging about 230,000
ha or 3.5% of the agricultural area and it is usually applied intermittently,
typically for relief of drought on high valued crops, except for a small area
(25,000 ha) under rice cultivation. Table 2.2 shows the importance of state
farms and agricultural cooperatives in agricultural production, especially
crop production. In 1981, there were 131 State farms and 1,320 agricultural
cooperatives. Small scale agriculture is divided between individual plots of
cooperative members, auxiliary farmers (mainly small plots rented to non-farm
or state farm workers) and purely private owners. Maximum land ownership is



legislated not to exceed 0.6 ha. Production by auxiliary and private farms
and from household plots of cooperative and State farm members is very
significant, especially in animal husbandry and fruits and vegetables, and
accounted for about 30% of gross agricultural production in 1981. In 1981,
crop production, accounted for 51% of total agricultural output and animal
production 49%. In the early sixties the respective shares were 60% and 40%.
Cereals contribute the major share of crop production, with maize dominating.
In 1981, 4.6 million tons of wheat was produced on 1.2 million ha, anid 7.0
million tons of maize on 1.2 million ha. Other crops in order of quantitative
importance include potatoes, barley, sunflowers, oats and rye. In the same
year, Hungary had 1.9 million cattle including 759,000 cows, 8.3 million pigs
and 43 million poultry. All other livestock (ducks, geese and rabbits)
contribute less than 4% of the total.

Sector Organization
2.06     Following the institution of centralized administered planning which
was introduced in the period after World War II, Hungarian agriculture was
collectivized and structured to conform to the centrally planned system. It
was in agriculture, however, that the reforms of that system, and the
departure from physical targetting in favor of economic, market-based
production/investment decisions, was first introduced. Agriculture has
therefore led the economy in the reform process, a fact which is put forward
to explain, at least to some extent, its positive performance in the past two
decades. The sector is organized around state farms and cooperatives. In
addition, there is a "second economy" in agriculture in the form of auxiliary
and private farms on household plots and from state farms and cooperative
members, which contributes a significant share of total sector output in
certain products. Under the system set in place by the reforms since 1968 the
sector as a whole--including state farms and cooperatives--is an
incentives-driven production system with profit seeking and financially
autonomous productive units, making decentralized decisions to invest and
produce. There remains a significant degree of state intervention in the
sector, but this is mainly in the form of price and tax/subsidy intervention
along lines common in market oriented economies. Services and credit are
delivered to the sector at market-based terms through state organization, and
output is marketed at pre-stated prices through state agencies (for major bulk
products) and/or on the free market for products (e.g. livestock products,



fruits and vegetables) in which private production is important. Planning in
agriculture has been retained in the system, but as an instrument of
indicative forecasting only; the pursuit of centrally pre-set physical targets
has been long abandoned.
Government Institutions
2.07     At the national level, the major State institution in the
agricultural sector is the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry (MEM),
It initiates virtually all the planning, price determination, organization and
regulation for the agriculture sector, including food industries and
forestry. MEM employs about 600 people. The other State agencies directly
involved in agriculture are: the National Planning Office which is
responsible for annual medium-term (5 year) and long-term (15-20 year)
development plans and in part for price determination and the National Board
for Prices and Materials, responsible for price analysis. Since the
restructuring of the economy towards decentralization in 1956/57, the role of
the line ministries, such as MEM, has shifted from lead to support. Thus MEM
no longer instructs, but instead advises. A more market oriented pricing
system has been introduced as the means of improving the direction of
agriculture.
2.08     MEM has also established a number of service enterprises which are of
particular importance to the project, namely: (a) AGROTEK, the Trading Company
for Agricultural Capital Equipment, which is the state monopoly import-export
agency for almost all agricultural equipment; (b) AGROKER, the county
Agricultural Machinery Supply Enterprise, of which there is one in each county
and 19 in total; and (c) AGROBER, the major consulting engineering and
contracting company in agriculture and the food industry.
B. Performance in the Agricultural Sector
2.09     Between 1970 and 1980, gross agricultural output grew at an average
annual rate of 3.2%. About two-thirds of this growth occurred between 1970
and 1975. Comparisons with USA, Western and Eastern European countries show
that the average agricultural growth rate in domestic terms of Hungary in
gross terms exceeds the corresponding rate in these countries. However,
between 1970 and 1980, the annual growth rate in domestic terms in value added
was little over 1%, with the net value of production declining from 46% to 37%
of gross production value, because input costs increased faster than the gross
value of output. Between 1970 and 1981, the area of arable land has remained
about the same, but a remarkable increase in crop yields has been achieved
(para 2.18). During the same period, livestock production and yields also
increased significantly.
C. Development Potential and Sector Issues
2.10     Hungarian agriculture is endowed with a relatively good physical
resource base, management and a work force, mostly adequate amounts of
machinery and farm inputs. However, with the exception of existing products
in which Hungary has a comparative advantage and good market prospects, in
view of the limited potential for major new lines of on-farm production, the
future growth in Hungarian agriculture lies more in increased earnings through
intensive output growth from existing commodities than in increased volume of



-6-
output. Increased earning may also be generated from increased value
added from improved quality and/or reduction in production, processing and
marketing costs. A tabular summary of the on-farm possibilities for the
major commodities is given in Table 2.3 below:

2.11      While the possibilities listed above are based on judgment and
therefore subject to quantification, confirmation and modification, they
clearly favor grain production. Several areas of action could lead to a
further improvement of this high priority development subsector, such as
further market orientation in the pricing system; better storage capacity,
especially for grains; and on-farm mechanization. The proposed project
embodies these objectives.
Prices
2.12      Although the overall pricing system in Hungary is geared toward
market oriented pricing of products, particularly in the industrial
sector, roughly 80% of agricultural prices are still centrally determined,
and Government interventions are the established practice for the
remaining free priced commodities to prevent wide fluctuations from
centrally determined levels. A fundamental policy of the Government is to
ensure adequate supplies to meet the expanding demand for foodstuffs by



domestic consumers at low prices in order to minimize increases in living
costs, also, in part, to maintain stable wages and prices which in turn affect
non-agricultural exports. In addition, surplus earnings have been extracted
from agriculture to finance other Government expenditures in a way which may
have created disincentives to production.  These have been the two traditional
pedestals of domestic producer price policy.  A third, efficiency, is now
being discussed by planners and policy makers. Prices are established on a
cost plus basis, with relative profitability reflecting, to a certain extent,
the planners' and not always the markets' demand, thus potentially inducing
resource misallocation. An agricultural pricing study would be carried out
under the project to measure the degree of disincentive and misallocation.
This will provide a basis for future dialogue on the topic (para 4.15).
2.13     The difficulties in grain storage and mechanization are treated in
more detail in the grain subsector section below. Hungary's comparative
advantage in grain production is clear and the prominence of grain in overall
sectoral production and agricultural exports is without parallel.
Consequently all issues connected with the subsector are taken very seriously
by the Hungarian authorities as has been evident in the discussions they have
had with the various Bank missions since May 1982 when the first economic
mission visited Hungary. The decentralization and reform processes which
began in 1968, with some setbacks in the mid-1970s, have been renewed since
1979. Compared to the system used before the reform process began, under
which physical targets were dominant components, the recent Five Year Plans
are merely indicative. More flexibility and enterprise autonomy is being
exercised, guided by centrally established economic regulators. The planning
process has thus progressed to consultative exchanges between the planning and
implementing units from the various sectors of the country.
D. Grain Subsector
Structure
2.14     Hungary's climate and resource base are generally well suited to
grain production. Of the total area of 9.3 million ha of the country, 71% or
6.6. million ha comprise the agricultural area, of which 69% or 4.6 million ha
are used for grain production. Wheat and maize total 90% of this production;
other grains include barley, rye and oats. Although the climate is suitable
for small grain production, it presents some problems for maize production.
Situated between the 450 N and 480 N latitudes, Hungary is on the margin
of the northern hemisphere's maize production zone. In the U.S. virtually all
maize grain production ceases north of 440 latitude. To obtain viable maize
yields of 7-10 tons/ha, long season (6-7 months) varieties are sown, resulting
in over 30% moisture content at harvest (September-November), which must be
dried to at least 16-18% moisture before it can be safely stored. This
involves use of imported heating oil (generally diesel) and possible reduced
feed value due to heat damage from the drying process. The wheat crop, which
is harvested in June-July, frequently results in significant losses (1-2%)
through shattering from severe summer rains if left unharvested too long.
Subsector Organization
2.15     Out of a total of about 1,450 social sector farms, 1,060 or 73%
engage in grain production. Cooperatives produce between 70-75% of total



- 8 -
annual production, followed by State farms with 15-20% of the total.
Smallholder plots are responsible for about 10% of the annual grain
production, mainly maize.   This is used for either their own consumption and
animal feed or sales to the surrounding social sector farms.
2.16     Under the MEM, the Grain Trust (GT), a State enterprise, is
responsible for procurement, storage and marketing of grains entering the
market to meet domestic demand including those for maintaining national
reserve stocks and export purposes. The GT is also the sole importer of
protein feed material through the foreign trade enterprise for grain,
AGRIMPEX, a commission agent, which is responsible for developing
export/import contracts and providing market information and analysis (A
detailed description of GT is given in PIF, Annexes 3 and 5.)
Extension
2.17     Extension services in Hungary are provided by commercial entities,
known as "Production Systems", but no publicly financed general extension
service exists. New technologies and innovations are introduced by these
systems as well as by MEM, from domestic and foreign sources to interested
farm enterprises. At present 83% of all socialist sector farms subscribe to
some grain Production System. MEM provides centralized services through its
applied research institutes, but the ability of farms to utilize these is
uneven. Over time expert enterprises have joined forces to establish these
commercial entities for agricultural consultation and management services. In
grain production, there are five such entities making available their services
throughout the country. For poorer enterprises, the fees appear too costly
and this has limited somewhat their access to extension advice. Also the
range of services is generally restricted to the Production Systems specialist
activities and is unable to address, in a comprehensive fashion, various
management and technical demands. Under the project, to meet specific project
needs, a group of specialist grain handlers would be sent for training abroad
by MEM and would form the nucleus of a MEM grain handling specialist extension
unit to train local personnel who are directly responsible for handling grain
(para 4.12).

into market channels. The remainder is stored on-farm for use as animal feed
by the producers. Hungary's average yields are compared with other countries

Although Hungary's grain yields rank well to the fore compared with Eastern
and Western European countries, the wheat and maize yields under normal
conditions range from 2 to 6 tons/ha and 2.5 to 8 tons/ha, respectively.
There is room for improvement of average yields through narrowing this range
(para 2.20) and increasing the number of farms using high yielding technology.

Feed grain imports, which consist mainly of low grade wheat and maize,
increased up to the middle of the decade and then declined sharply, totalled
60 thousand tons in 1981.
Subsector Issues and Strategy
2.20     Grain exports are the third largest agriculture export item following
livestock and livestock products and fruits and vegetables. Almost
three-quarters of all agricultural exports are for convertible currency.
Within this, 80% of all grain exports are for convertible currency. With a
relatively favorable market outlook /1, for Hungary, expanding output of this
convertible currency earning product is important. However, two serious input
problems currently limit the possiblities for development of grain production
- lack of suitable grain storage causing high post-harvest losses and
inadequate farm mechanization resulting in lower than potential yields. In
addition, it appears that the current controlled price and subsidy system,
particularly for wheat and maize, has contributed to a less than optimal
product mix, causing grain to be produced in areas with a relatively poor
resource base. The recent economic reforms aim to correct this situation
through more appropriate prices and a gradual decrease of subsidies. Subject
to differentials in soil types and fertility levels, the wide range of grain
production yields should be narrowed as a result of a change in the production
pattern to reflect regional comparative advantage, causing a reduction in
grain output in marginal areas. The pricing study proposed to be included
under the project (para 4.15) will assist in developing a more rational price
system.

demand for grain storage compared with current and projected production and
stocks is shown in Table 2.7 below.

The situation portrayed in Table 2.7 for 1982 is extreme due to the unusually
good growing and harvesting conditions, but it serves well to illustrate the
great need for increased storage capacity. The projected 1985 deficit in
grain storage in Table 2.7 is expected to be substantially greater than in
1981 unless urgent action is taken to improve the utilization of existing
storage and provide new on-farm and off-farm facilities. The original 1981-85
Five Year Plan, taking account of expected financial constraints in Hungary,
called for an investment in grain storage of 1,230 - 1,280 thousand tons of
installed capacity before 1985; but to date a lack of resources has prevented
implementation of the program. With the proposed project, and with access to
lower unit cost imported metal silos, investment would be about 1,450,000
tons, of which about 970,000 tons would be incremental capacity and the
remainder replacement of abandoned existing stores. The increase in effective
capacity would result from the increase in utilization given project
modernization investments.

The number of tractors has declined in recent years but is now stable, the
number for 1981 is equivalent to 10.3 for each 1,000 ha of arable and
permanent crops. The average capacity of tractors increased from 34 kW (46
hp) in 1970 to 57 kW (77hp) in 1981. This represents a medium capacity
tractor and is likely to approximate the average size found in many comparator
countries. From this it appears that Hungarian agriculture has less tractor
capacity than comparator countries, including the USSR. This does not,
however, take into account the qualitative factor. In recent years Hungary
has procured an increasing volume of its tractors from Western countries and
has also improved the quality of its domestic tractor production through



- 13 -
engine technology imported under license from France (Renault) and West
Germany (MAN). Foreign exchange constraints still require that most imported
tractors and equipment come from the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance
Countries (CMEA) countries. They are rarely able to handle the needs imposed
by modern crop technology and high yield level.
2.23     The situation regarding grain harvesters is almost as acute as for
tractors. It must be appreciated that: (a) Hungary is a small and homogeneous
country in which all of the harvest of a particular crop takes place virtually
at the same time; (b) all combine harvesters are imported, mainly from the
USSR; for machinery from the West, spare parts are very difficult to get
because of convertible foreign exchange limitations, and from the CMEA
countries because of difficulties in filling orders; and (c) production has
nearly doubled in the last ten years, while the number of combines has
remained relatively stable. Available CMEA combine harvesters are of
typically low capacity and cannot handle a 4-6 ton wheat crop or a 6-8 ton
maize crop in a reasonable time. This is a severe problem as maize grain and
sugar beet crops must be harvested rapidly to permit land preparation prior to
winter and timely sowing of wheat. Similarly wheat needs to be harvested
rapidly to avoid weather-related losses from severe summer rains.  There is a
trade-off with respect to harvesting of maize grain; if harvested early,
adequate time is available for pre-winter land preparation and sowing of
wheat, but this can lead to maize grain of higher moisture content, thus
increasing drying costs or increased losses as ears fall off the stalks.
Greater harvesting capacity reduces the range of this trade-off. Another
consideration is that, for maize grain, the shorter season varieties having
lower yields are less profitable, but greater harvesting capacity reduces the
harvest period, permitting a longer growing season and thus the use of longer
season, higher yielding varieties.
2.24     Thus, while the level of mechanization of most operations is 100%,
what remains of great importance is the actual time required to complete these
operations. Enterprises and specialized production systems have set up very
modern servicing and spare parts systems to minimize breakdown time losses and
to permit longer working hours in peak periods. For example, many farms now
work tractors for an average of 3,000 hours per year, while in the West 1,500
hours per year is considered good. Development of spare part manufacturing in
Hungary has helped, but many specialized parts must still be imported.
2.25     The general mechanization policy, under the current plan, calls for
an increased proportion of more modern, better quality tractors and the
utilization of more self-propelled combine harvesters. The total stock of
tractors is planned to be increased by 6%, although the actual number will be
reduced, implying an increase in the average power capacity. To the extent
that resources are available, high quality new tractors would be imported from
developed market economies; the remainder would come mainly from improved
quality domestic production. The share of total agricultural investment for
machinery (66%) is expected to remain the same in 1985 as in 1980, but total
investment in agriculture is planned to be 4-5% greater than in the previous
Five-Year Plan in real terms.

Achievement of these targets would permit cereal exports of 2 million tons in
1985. To assist in this development effort, a program was elaborated in 1980
known as the Intensive Grain Production Program (IGPP). This program
incorporates a total of 1.4 to 1.5 million ha of cereal grain growing land,
upon which it is estimated that, with adequate inputs, yields could be
increased by 1 ton/ha for wheat and 1.5 tons/ha for maize.
2.27     The technology of IGPP has been developed by the specialized
commercial Production Systems (para 2.17) Iparzeru Kucoricatermelo Rendzer
(IKR) - Industrial Corn Production System, headquartered in Babolna and
Kukorica Es Iparinoveny Termelesi Egyutmukodes (KITE) - Corn and Industrial
Crops Production System, headquartered in Nadudvar, and others, in
collaboration with the MEM, the National Research Institute, the Plant
Protection and Agricultural Chemistry Institute, the Farm Mechanization and
Rural Engineering Institute, and Seed Production Organizations. It is based
on the use of higher powered tractors and implements for earlier and better
tillage, improved soil moisture conservation, improved and timely seeding, and
application of chemicals and fertilizers. Moreover, the use of higher
capacity harvesters would save about 4% of the wheat crop otherwise lost due
to weather hazards (para 2.23), enable cultivation of more medium-late maize
with a higher production potential resulting in a major improvement in
productivity in the areas covered (para 2.23), allow more complete and timely
straw removal and silage harvest, thus allowing more timely land preparation
and seeding of subsequent crops (para 2.23). As a result of all these
actions, grain production, in areas covered by IGPP, is expected to increase
by an average of 24%, and the cost of production per ton of wheat and maize to
decrease by an average of 21% and 6%, respectively.

2.28      The anticipated development schedule of the IGPP is as follows;
Year                     '000 ha
1981-83                     288
1983-84                     300
1984-85                     300
1985-86                     200
1986-87                     200
1987-88                     200
Total                     1,488
In 1981-82, IGPP was implemented on 134,000 ha and to date production results
have been equal to or better than expectations.  Under the project, an area of
about 330,000 ha would be covered in 1984 and 1985.  Cooperative and State
Farms joining the scheme use the recommended technology on the qualifying
parts of their cereal land, following guidelines established by their
production system. These systems provide technical advice, inputs, machinery
and services to their subscribing member farms for a particular crop or
production line. Membership in a production system is not a necessary
condition of eligibility for the program, but it does help greatly as it is
considered as prima facie evidence of access to appropriate technology.
III. THE CREDIT POLICY AND INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE
A. Agricultural Credit Policy and Administration /1
3.01      Virtually all credit to agriculture in Hungary is channeled through
the National Bank of Hungary (NBH). The stock of agricultural credit in NBH
from 1976 to 1982, and its distribution by type of beneficiary are summarized
in Table 3.1. The stock of credit is also compared with annual agricultural
GDP and investment and to total credit in all sectors. Credit distribution is
almost exactly in proportion to land distribution. The total stock of credit
has grown at an annual average rate of almost 10% since 1976 and is now 30% of
the agricultural GDP. More significantly it has also grown in relation to
agricultural investment. This illustrates the new thrust of Government policy
to increase the use of credit as a means of financing investment in the sector
and diminishing the role of budgetary financing.
3.02      Within the stock of agricultural credit, the annual average growth
rates over the period for short, medium and long term credit are 21%, 12% and
5% respectively. The very rapid growth in short term credit is allied to
similar growth in agricultural inputs over the past decade, while the slow
growth in long term credit is an illustration of the time required to bring
about a fundamental adjustment in the structure of investment financing which
has its roots in the economic structure. A highlight of credit financing has
been the growth in the Export Promotion Credit Line (para 3.04). This has
shown the most rapid growth of all credit lines in the sector over the period
- 22% annual average - and now accounts for a quarter of all long term
agricultural credit.

/a Preliminary
Source: National Bank of Hungary
3.03      For agricultural investments there are two possible windows:  a
general agricultural credit line and an export credit line.  Most medium-
and long-term investment credit is granted under the General Agricultural
Credit Line /1 to efficient and profitable state farms and cooperatives at
commercial terms. Medium- and long-term agricultural credit under this
line is an important Government source of funds for improving efficiency
through the application of technology. Between 1976 and 1982, the volume
of credit has increased by almost 75% (Table 3.1) indicating recent
Government emphasis in capitalizing the agricultural sector. All loans
for grain storage under the project would be within this line of credit.
3.04      About 25% of agricultural investment credit finances
export-oriented projects under the Export Production Credit Line /1. Such
line of credit promotes investments to generate exports to convertible
currencies areas. It is currently the investment credit program with the
highest priority in Hungary. Lending terms and conditions under this line
are strict to ensure selection of the most productive and credit effective
subloans. The NBH grants agricultural loans, as with all its lending, for
/_ For further details see PIF, Annex 4.



- 17 -
profitable foreign exchange earning investments by creditworthy enterprises.
In addition, export promotion investments must be capable of; (a) exporting
70-80% of their incremental production; (b) generating foreign exchange
earnings equivalent to the amount of the loan within four years, from project
inception; (c) yielding 9% net return on fixed assets and permanent working
capital; and (d) having a high level of own financing. Nearly 80% of the
credit applications for the Export Promotion Credit line are made by
agriculture cooperatives for investments of less than 50 million forints each,
and involve imports of agricultural machinery and equipment. About half of
the loans extended to agricultural cooperatives in 1982 were associated with
the Agricultural Production Systems (para 2.27).
3.05     Export Promotion Credits for all sectors now account for 50% of the
investment lending of the NBH and are targeted to reach 60% of total bank
investments over the current Sixth Five Year Plan.  Of the 54 billion forints
which were disbursed during the 1976-1980 period, 10.9 billion went to over
1,600 agricultural investments, representing some 80% of all borrowers.
During the same period, the balance of 43 billion Ft. was lent to industrial
investment projects.  The agricultural investment credit is estimated by NBH
to have generated the equivalent of Ft 25.0 billion in foreign exchange.
3.06     Loans to enterprises are channeled through the state banking
systems. There are eight banks in the country; the principal financial
institutions are the State Development Bank and NBH. They are the main source
of production and investment credit. The State Development Bank is the
principal source of credit for large government sponsored industrial and
infrastructural projects. The NBH finances mainly enterprises and performs
the dual role of central bank and principal commercial and development bank.
B. The National Bank of Hungary-NBH L1
3.07     As the Central Bank, NBH has the important responsibility of
establishing and administering the banking system credit policy especially
with regard to the volume of credit, the sectoral distribution of funds, and
the interest rate levels. As a commercial bank, it is the major source of
corporate credit and of credit to agriculture. NBH administers deposits of
state farms and cooperatives and extends them loans for working capital and
investment purposes. It carries out payments, credit, and other banking
operations relating to foreign trade and to other external economic relations,
and it administers exchange control. Financial transactions among
agricultural enterprises and between Government and agricultural enterprises
are entirely conducted through NBH. The financial assets of enterprises
consist principally of demand deposits with NBH.
Organization and Staffing
3.08     The Bank headquarters are in Budapest; it has 19 regional offices and
71 branches throughout Hungary and employs approximately 6,400 persons, 65% of
whom are professionals. About 25% of all NBH staff is directly or indirectly
engaged in agricultural lending. The organization is structured in five line
/1 For further details see PIF, Annex 4



- 18 -
departments: monetary, credit policy, industry, food and agriculture, and
housing, as well as a number of supporting departments such as legal, and
personnel. The president is assisted by five vice-presidents, heads of the
five departments and by six managing directors. The president and
vice-presidents are appointed by the Council of Ministers. Agricultural
credit services are available in all NBH regional and branch offices and are
carried out by agricultural specialists for the technical part and by regular
bank employees for administrative operations. About 50% of professionals
operating in the agricultural department are economists, 15% accountants, 10%
agronomists and veterinarians and the rest are administrative personnel.
NBH Lending Policies and Procedures
3.09     Loan approval responsibilities vary in accordance with the volume of
credit extended. Investment loans are approved by branch managers (Ft. 30
million), department heads (Ft. 80 million), and above this level by the Board
of Directors. Working capital loans are approved by branch offices.
3.10     The procedures to select NBH investment loan beneficiaries are very
strict and in accordance with sound principles of commercial banking. The
information required by NBH to assess the suitability of investments and
credit recovery prospects is: (a) a technical appraisal of the proposed
investments; (b) a detailed description of project cost estimates, in local
currency and foreign exchange; and (c) project cash flow with specific
indication of loan amortization within the periods indicated by the Bank's
Credit Policy guidelines.
3.11     During preparation of credit applications, NBH staff maintain close
contact with prospective borrowers to assist in identification and preparation
of viable projects. Marketing assessments are often prepared with the
assistance of more experienced commercial and technical staff of production
systems, such as IKR or KITE or of other state farms and cooperatives. The
Ministry of Foreign Trade and NBH Foreign Trade office also provide their
marketing assessment and clearance in case of credit application for export
production.
3.12     Supervision of agricultural projects is satisfactory and it is
performed generally by technical staff and loan officers of NBH branch offices
assisted by technical staff of production systems such as IKR or by
experienced staff of state farms and cooperatives.
3.13     The NBH interest rate on investment loans for agricultural
development loans is 14%. Export promotion credits are extended at 14% with a
45% rebate on interest charges upon successful completion of their targets.  A
2% reduction in the interest rate is granted to indirect export promotion
investment loans, e.g. for storage. All subloans under the present project
are expected to fall under these two categories. Maximum maturity of
investment loans is 12 years or the economic life of the investment, whichever
is less. In both cases a one year grace period is included.



- 19 -
NBH Finances
3.14     NBH assets include loans to enterprises and state budgetary
allocations and its liabilities include corporate accounts and time deposits.
The 1982 balance sheet indicates that NBH financial transactions with
enterprises constitute about 48% of its long-term portfolio and about 81% of
its short-term portfolio. Enterprises accounts and time deposits amounted to
about 25% of its liabilities.
3.15     The audited income statements for the period 1977-1982 show that the
institution is in a sound financial position: (a) net profit averages 30% of
total income; (b) low administrative costs averaging 2.2% and a high (47%)
spread between financial income and financial costs. NBH arrears and defaults
on repayments are insignificant due to NBH's strict control of the
beneficiaries finances, supervision of projects and administration of
beneficiaries procurement and sales transactions through their NBH accounts.
Accounting and Auditing
3.16     NBH's accounting system is functional.  Lending activities are
computerized and centrally controlled through a network of terminals in all 19
branch offices. Internal auditing of lending operations is undertaken by NBH
directly on the basis of random controls by supervisory offices. External
auditing is done by independent certified public accountants, an external
autonomous agency, whose auditing standards are satisfactory.
C. The Subborrower Financial Structure
The Subborrowers
3.17     GT, the State Grain Trading Agency (para 2.16) is expected to be the
single largest borrower under the project, utilizing about 20% of all project
funds. All off-farm storage facilities and equipment financed under the
project will be owned and operated by GT. The remaining project
beneficiaries, excluding GT, are expected to be about 20% of the most
productive and profitable state farms and cooperatives. They are expected to
absorb about 80% of project funds, either directly or through the production
system IKR. Most farms are members of the technical operations production
systems which provide them with extension services and often help to channel
NBH credit to the sector.
Earning Power and Profit Allocation
3.18     Performance indicators, derived from the financial statements (PIF,
Annex 4, Table 10) of a sample of about 10% of the state farms and
cooperatives expected to be project beneficiaries, show that such enterprises
are in good financial standing and their earnings record is more than adequate
to insure credit recovery.



- 20 -
Capital Structure and Management of Current Assets
3.19     The capital structure of agricultural enterprises is extremely
conservative. The average debt - equity ratio of the 20 enterprises sampled
is 0.1/1. The average ratio of accounts receivable to accounts payable is
3/1. Agricultural enterprises keep large cash and bank deposit accounts and
very large inventories. In general, the average current ratio among sampled
enterprises is 7/1. Recently the authorities, in response to the worsening of
the external situation, have encouraged a more efficient management of current
assets by tightening transfers of short-term funds to enterprises to induce
lowering of current assets positions, especially cash, banks deposits and
inventories, and to promote corporate self-financing.
Accounting and Auditing
3.20     The authorities exercise strict control on corporate accounts.  At
the beginning of the fiscal year financial resources are earmarked for the
current and capital accounts of enterprises. Profits are preallocated for a
variety of corporate and social purposes in conformity with strict government
guidelines. Corporate accounts are generally kept according to standards
acceptable to the Bank. However, an assessment of the subborrowers management
of corporate funds and of profitability evaluation through the establishment
of a functional cost accounting system to determine corporate cost and revenue
centers would be advantageous, especially for such large borrowers as GT and
IKR. It would assist these agencies to improve corporate efficiency. The
project would address this issue (para 4.13).
3.21     Accounts of state farms and agricultural cooperatives are audited
once every two years by the auditing directorate of the Ministry of Finance
(MOF). The MOF controls mainly: (a) compliance of accounts with current
accounting procedures; (b) the enterprise compliance with credit guidelines in
the use of borrowed resources; and (c) status of fixed assets and permanent
working capital of state farms.
3.22     Auditing of cash and deposit accounts of agricultural enterprises
with NBH is done directly by NBH. MOF also exercises the fiscal control of
enterprises to control appropriate recording of profits and taxes in
compliance with the fiscal legislation. No formal audit reports of
enterprises is issued. In case of anomalies an MOF official statement called
the "Protocol" is issued qualifying the anomalies encountered in the financial
and fiscal management of the enterprises and imposing the penalties provided
by law. This is a proxy for the auditors statement. Under the project,
however, systematic auditing would be carried out a yearly basis and a
short-term audit report, prepared both in accordance with World Bank
Guidelines (para 5.10).

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Concept and Objectives
4.01     The project is designed to increase grain surpluses available for
export by reducing post-harvest losses through improved storage and by
increasing grain yields in existing areas through improved mechanization. One
of the more important results of the project will be to strengthen Hungary's
balance of payments through expansion of agricultural exports. As a result,
the Project is accorded high priority by the Hungarian government.
4.02     Grain storage development will promote the project objective by
rationalizing and expanding the existing grain storage capacity, both on- and
off-farm, with the aim of reducing current and potential post-harvest losses
in the most cost effective fashion. There is a shortage of "off-farm" storage
capacity at peak grain production periods as well as a shortage of overall
storage needs through the year, necessitating the current widespread use of
both temporary and open or emergency storage. The shortage of longer term
storage means that wheat often has to remain stored on farms four to six
months leaving a shortage of storage capacity for the subsequent maize crop.
The strategy of the storage component is to:
(a) provide flexible new storage capacity, particularly off-farm, to
meet peak demands for wheat procurement;
(b) increase the effective capacity of existing facilities by
modernization and improved grain handling equipment;
(c) provide new and upgraded storage capacity for new demands imposed
by imported feed components; and
(d) replace deteriorating grain storage facilities, especially
temporary storage, as rapidly as possible.
This component will also include a small technical assistance effort in areas
of grain production mechanization, grain handling, cost accounting,
agricultural price analysis and project preparation.
4.03     While Hungary is seen to have a comparative advantage in wheat and
maize production, yields -- while quite good -- are capable of significant
increase through improving both the timeliness and quality of mechanical
operations. Greater grain on-farm mechanization capacity of improved quality
will permit more timely harvesting which will reduce weather related damage
and losses, reduce physical loss of grain and permit more timely seed bed
preparation and more optimal seeding times leading to improved yields and
decreased cultivation costs.
B. Project Content
4.04     The project would consist of investments in grain storage and in
mechanization for grain production in the final 2 years (1984-85) of the
current 5 year plan. A small technical assistance component in grain



- 22 -
handling, mechanization study tours, development of a management information
system for major subborrowers, an agricultural price policy study and future
project preparation would also be financed out of the project. Specifically
the investments would comprise:
Grain Storage
(a) On-Farm
- 50 new and improved flat grain stores, 5,000 tons each;
- 600 portable pneumatic grain handling units, 20 tons/hour each;
- 76 glass lined steel tower vacuum silos, 700 tons each and
loading/unloading equipment;
- 40 concrete bunker silos, 3,500 tons each; and
- 44 feed grinding and mixing units, 4 tons output/hour.
(b) Off-Farm
- 135 metal silos with cleaning equipment, 6,000 tons each;
- temperature sensors and aeration equipment to modernize 30
existing metal silos of 6,000 tons each;
- 300 automatic temperature sensors, aeration units and
continuous level indicators to modernize existing concrete
silos, averaging 10,000 tons per installation (12 cells and 1.5
cell equivalents in interstitial spaces);
- 100 portable pneumatic grain handling units, 100-150 tons/hr;
and
800 moisture meters, rapid type.
Mechanization
- tractors, 495 units, 2 types, heavy duty and multipurpose;
- wheat and maize harvesting equipment, 1,285 units;
- planting, fertilizing and spraying equipment, 1,130 units
- tillage equipment, 1,840 units.
Training, Technical Assistance and Studies
- Grain handling training - 25 persons for 5-6 week training
course abroad (MEM);
- Mechanization study tours - 3 man-months travel abroad, 4-6
persons (MEM);
- Management information system - 2 man-years of qualified
consultant time in country (GT, IKR and KITE);
- Project preparation - 6 man-months of qualified consultants in
country (NBH); and
- Agricultural Price Policy Study.
4.05     Investment in on-farm storage and mechanization would be undertaken
by about 330 subborrowers in the social sector, including state and
cooperative farms and IKR. Investment in off-farm storage would be carried
out by GT, the state grain marketing agency. Although incremental fertilizers
and other chemicals required by the project are minor, the Government would



- 23 -
ensure that an adequate stock of the generally required fertilizers and
chemicals is maintained domestically and made available for grain production.
Assurances on this were obtained during negotiations. The implementation
schedule and detailed list of mechanization equipment are contained in Annex
I, Table 1 and Annex II, Table 3.
Detailed Features
4.06     Grain Storage.  Effective storage capacity would be increased under
the Project by the construction of new storage facilities, the modernization
of existing facilities permitting increased utilization, and the addition of
modern grain handling equipment permitting increased turnover. Modernization
of metal silos and concrete silos with aeration and temperature measurement
equipment, and in the case of concrete silos, continous level indicators,
would help improve storage management tools and thus increase the effective
capacity. Capacity utilization of both metal and concrete silos would also be
improved by establishing storage of grain in cells which must now be kept
empty to allow for grain rotations due to inadequate existing aeration
systems. As a result of proposed project investments to facilitate improved
management, off-farm turnover in metal and concrete silos is expected to
increase from 2.2 to 2.5 and on-farm from an estimated present flat storage
turnover of 1.0 to a turnover of 2.0, one used for wheat and one for the
subsequent maize crop. Grain Trust flat storage effective capacity would be
increased by the use of pneumatic grain handling equipment to speed up the
unloading of bins and improve storage space utilization by combining small
lots and by making it possible to store different grains by the use of
temporary partitions. Grain storage subprojects would be subject to a
detailed review by MEM to avoid locational over-capacity (paras 4.18, 5.05 and
PIF, Annex 4).
4.07     Mechanization.  The Intensive Grain Production Program (IGPP), under
which this component falls, has been described in Chapter II (paras
2.26-2.28). Investment under this component would provide the necessary
tractor power and equipment to implement the IGPP on an additional 330,000
ha. The basic strategy would be to increase tractor hp/ha together with the
associated tillage, seeding and chemical application equipment and finally
harvesting equipment. This would permit timeliness of operations. Increased
hp/ha would be achieved by fielding greater hp tractors to permit reduced
operating costs, particularly in fuel but also in labor. With this added
power available to operate multifunctional equipment, actual tractor hours per
ha can also be reduced. Under the project, 220 tractors (240-250 hp) and 275
multipurpose tractors (150-180 hp) would be required. These would supplement
the limited number of large tractors on farms joining IGPP, or enable farms to
increase the area already in IGPP by pulling larger and more productive
implements. Meanwhile, some of the smaller tractors would be retained for
operations on irregular, small fields and for transport.
4.08     Under the Project, wheat land would not be plowed but tilled with
heavy-duty discs or heavy duty cultivators, with chisel plowing or subsoiling
carried out once every three years.  Autumn ploughing for the following year's
maize crop would remain necessary. To speed up seedbed preparation and enable
seeding at the optimum time, larger combination machines would be used to



- 24 -
allow better moisture infiltration, quick and uniform germination, and a
relatively smooth level surface; permitting subsequent operations to be
carried out with relative ease (PIF, Annex 5).
4.09     The small grain seeding drills proposed in the Project are 12 to 14 m
wide, with larger diameter discs to reduce blockages and thus allow more
uniform seed placement (fewer missed rows) and depth. They would also have
large capacity grain and fertilizer hoppers. The large press wheels would
compact the soil about the seed for quick, uniform germination. The row
planting equipment proposed for maize has a 12 row capacity, using the cyclo
pneumatic system of grain distribution to each row, which provides uniform
distribution of grain in the row with only two seeds at the same location.
The furrow openers are designed to operate amongst considerable amounts of
trash while giving uniform seeding depth. The row planting equipment is
equipped to place fertilizers at the required location (banding), and in
addition to place herbicides and insecticides, if required, all in one
operation.
4.10     Equipment to be provided through the Project for application of
fertilizer and other chemicals would consist of units with larger tank and
hopper holding capacities and increased widths of spread than the present
truck mounted units. This would reduce the refill frequency and operating
time. The improved ground conditions from better and more uniform tillage
would permit increased speed. The Project would also provide for the purchase
of a small number of self-propelled and trailed liquid manure and fertilizer
injectors/spreaders to be used by associations of farms which are served by
agro-chemical centers having mixing plants for liquid or suspended
fertilizer. These would be used to spread liquid fertilizer, liquid manure
and sewage, the liquid manure and sewage being injected at 30-35 cm depth to
protect the environment.
4.11     Currently lack of capacity causes the wheat harvest to be extended
beyond the optimal 14 days period, causing ripe grain to remain in the field
where it is subject to physical and quality losses. The 440 large capacity
combine grain harvesters proposed for the project would increase the country's
combine harvesting capacity and enable the wheat in the project area to be
harvested within 14 harvest days thus reducing both physical and quality
losses, and drying requirements. While the time constraint for harvesting
maize is not as crucial as for wheat, the increased capacity would enable the
early maize to be harvested quickly where winter wheat is to be planted on the
same field, enable medium late maize to be harvested before November. The
round baler and bale loaders proposed under the Project would enable an
increased amount of wheat straw and some corn stover, mostly for bedding, to
be gathered into large bales and removed quickly, thereby allowing timely
tillage. High capacity forage harvesters would reduce the time required for
the maize silage harvest, thus extending the growing period of the the silage
maize, while enabling seeding of the following wheat crop within the optimum
period in the second half of September.
4.12     Training, Technical Assistance and Studies.  The Project would
finance the strengthening of grain handling and stock management operations at
the farm level. MEM would, in collaboration with GT, select about 25 skilled
or motivated workers from different areas of grain storage operations



- 25 -
(fumigation, quality control, handling, etc.) and send them abroad for 5-6
weeks for intensive training. The trained personnel, on their return, would
form a training corps in MEM. Short courses would be organized, aimed
primarily at training unskilled and semi-skilled workers involved in grain
storage operations, such as loaders and unloaders, cleaners, quality control
staff, etc. The Project would provide three man/months of study visits abroad
(4 to 6 trips) to (a) enable MEM or AGROTEK staff (para 2.08) to evaluate the
performance of equipment of types not currently used in Hungary; and (b) to
observe and evaluate technical and economic aspects of mechanization abroad
having a potential for introduction in Hungary, such as swathing, windrowing
and subsequent combining of wheat under adverse weather conditions.
4.13     Professionally qualified accountants would be employed under Bank
guidelines to design a cost accounting Management Information System (MIS) for
the Grain Trust, IKR and KITE to determine the costs of different activities.
This would provide management of these agencies with a more accurate basis to
determine profitability and to make investment and operational decisions. The
consultants would be retained by NBH on behalf of GT, IKR and KITE for about
two man-years on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. Outline terms
of reference for this task are given in Annex 4.
4.14     The Project would also provide for 6 man-months of technical
assistance to help develop the agricultural project preparation capacity in
NBH, particularly regarding project economic analysis. NBH would retain
suitably qualified consultants in accordance with the Bank guidelines for this
task.
4.15     Finally, under the auspices of the Project, Government, under the
on-going work program within its Agricultural Economics Institute, would carry
out an agricultural price policy study with a team of suitably qualified
economists. Detailed terms of reference and time framework for the study were
agreed during negotiations. Bank staff would guide and assist in the study as
part of project supervision. The study aims to assess (a) the efficiency of
the current pricing and subsidy system in terms of promoting the potential
maximum net revenue earning capacity of the sector; and (b) the effect of the
current pricing policy on net foreign trade earnings. The study, which would
be financed by the Government, would provide the country with an effective
tool for further policy analysis in this area. Project funds would provide
for about four visits to Bank Headquarters for senior team members to discuss
the study and review drafts with qualified Bank staff. The study would be
undertaken in two phases. Phase 1 covering grain would be completed and
furnished to the Bank by September 1984. Phase 2, covering all other major
agricultural commodities produced in Hungary would be completed and sent to
the Bank by September 1985.
4.16     During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the above
training, technical assistance and study programs would be carried out.
C. Status of Design and Implementation
4.17     No major civil works are included under the project.  Flat storage
for on-farm subprojects consists of a simple rectangular building with a
reinforced concrete floor and walls and moveable partitions within. The
design has been standardized by AGROBER, a state owned consulting engineering



- 26 -
firm (para 2.08) and is readily available.  Other standardized civil works are
foundations for on-farm wet grain tower silos and also complete concrete
bunker silos for which precast concrete forms are widely available. These are
simple structures, in which the construction units present on most
agricultural enterprises are well versed. Off-farm civil works again comprise
only simple concrete foundations for metal grain silos. Hungar, has much
experience in erecting and operating both wet (high moisture, 24-30%) and dry
(low moisture, 14-16%) metal grain silos; foreign suppliers have already
trained teams of local workers. Technical supervision is supplied by the
manufacturers as needed.
4.18     Procurement of project equipment is expected to start in mid 1983,
which would allow the start of field implementation in early 1984. The
mechanization component is expected to be completed within 2 years with about
half the equipment delivered in 1984 and half in 1985. A similar
implementation period is expected for the grain storage component. Individual
stores and silos are expected to be completed and in use in the same year as
commencement of construction. Currently flat stores take about 6 months to
construct. Least cost location studies in connection with new and modernized
grain stores under the Project have been undertaken by MEM to ensure that no
subproject would contribute to any regional or county imbalance and that each
subproject would have an acceptable turnover. At time of appraisal MEM, using
detailed inflow-outflow analysis, had identified the future deficit areas by
country (PIF Annex 5). MEM has now identified the appropriate least cost
balance between off-farm and on-farm storage in these counties. This analysis
was provided to the Bank during negotiations.
4.19     Applications for loans were solicited by advertisements in newspapers
and on radio in February/March 1983 and all subborrowers for the first year of
the project were identified prior to negotiations.
D. Cost Estimates
4.20     The project cost is estimated at Ft. 12,529 million (US$313.2
million), of which 52% or about US$163 million, is foreign exchange.
4.21     Local and foreign exchange cost estimates are based on early 1983
construction costs and manufacturers' prices including transportation and
handling costs. The rate of exchange used is the January 1983 rate of US$ 1 =
Ft 40. Physical contingencies of 10% have been applied only to the civil
works portion of the grain storage component. Price contingencies for 1983
and for the project implementation period 1984 and 1985 have been estimated to
be respectively 8.0%, 7.5% and 7.0% for foreign currency costs and 8.0%, 8.0%
and 7.5% for local costs. Taxes and duties included amount to Ft 717 million
(US$18 million). Consultant costs are estimated at US$12,500 per man-month in
foreign and local costs including salary and benefits, firms fee, travel costs
and local subsistence. Project cost estimates are summarized in the following
table;

E. Project Financing
4.22            The proposed Bank loan of US$130.4 million would finance about 42% of
project cost, and about 80% of the estimated total foreign exchange
component. The Loan would also finance the capitalized front end fee of
US$326,000 representing 0.25% of the total loan amount. The additional
financing required for project implementation would be provided by the
Government, presently estimated to be in the amount of US$89.2 million or 28%
of project cost from domestic credit sources and from subborrowers equity
contribution in the amount of US$94.0 million or about 30% of project cost.
The Bank loan would be made to the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) for 15 years
with a three year grace period at a variable interest rate linked to the
borrowing costs of the Bank. All Bank funds would be on-lent by NBH to the
beneficiaries on terms and conditions agreed by NBH and the Bank (paras 5.07
/1   For detailed cost estimates see Annex II, Table I and PIF, Annex 2.



- 28 -
and 5.08).  Funds necessary for training activities to be carried out by MEM
would be transferred by NBH to the Government on the same terms as those given
by the Bank to NBH, including repayment of principal and other charges.  Bank
funds would finance mechanical and electrical installations for storage
facilities, (US$55.0 million) or about 77% of total such cost; agricultural
machinery and equipment, (US$74.6) or about 41% of total such cost; consulting
and training (US$0.5) million or about 71% of total such cost. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations with regard to adequate counterpart
financing and to on-lending funds as above described. The detailed financing
plan is summarized in the following Table.

F. Procurement
4.23     All goods, equipment and services to be financed from the Bank loan
would be procured in accordance with Bank Guidelines. In addition, US$15
million of fertilizers and plant protection chemicals for general use in grain
production (para 4.05) would be procured through international competitive
bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank Guidelines for Procurement.



- 29 -
4.24     Grain Storage Component.  Contracts for procurement of grain storage
equipment and spare parts to be financed by the Bank, for an amount equivalent
to about US$55 million, would be awarded after ICB in accordance with the Bank
Guidelines for Procurement. Such equipment includes for on-farm use, metal
tower silos for wet grain storage, pneumatic grain handling equipment and feed
grain grinding and mixing units; and for off-farm use, metal silos, high speed
pneumatic grain handling equipment, moisture meters and equipment for
modernizing existing concrete silos. Civil works would be carried out by
force account and under local contracts (para 4.17).  The small size of the
individual civil works structures, and their wide dispersion in time and
space, preclude bulking into contract sizes of potential interest to outside
contractors, so that ICB would not be practical.
4.25     Agricultural Equipment.  Contracts for the procurement of imported
foreign manufactured agricultural machinery to be financed by the Bank, for an
amount equivalent to about $75 million, would be awarded under international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines. Such equipment would
comprise of multipurpose tractors, heavy duty mold board plows, liquid manure
spreaders, combine harvesters and forage harvesters. Other locally produced
on-farm equipment of a quality meeting the project's needs, to be financed
locally, would be procured through local procedures.
4.26     The actual procurement process for ICB procured goods and equipment
would be carried out by AGROTEK, the state agency for import of agricultural
equipment, fertilizers and chemicals. AGROTEK is well staffed and has had the
experience in international procurement. For the purposes of development of
technical specifications for on-farm equipment, its engineering staff would
call on the specialized assistance of the National Agricultural Machinery
Institute at Godollo, which, in coordination with MEM, is responsible for
developing technical parameters on all new agricultural machinery. Input on
specifications would also be received from the specialized commercial
production systems, particularly KITE and IKR for cereals (para 2.27).
Technical specifications concerning both on- and off-farm grain storage
systems and equipment would be developed by AGROTEK and GT in consultation
with AGROBER, the state owned agricultural engineering consultant firm, which
has international experience in grain storage. The equipment, including
spares, would be imported by AGROTEK and transferred to the subborrowers
either directly or through the AGROKER, the state owned system of county
agricultural equipment supply companies. Draft tender documents for ICB
procurement were made available to the Bank prior to negotiations.
4.27     Technical assistance in training of grain handling specialists abroad
would be procured by MEM, through procedures acceptable to the Bank, while
technical assistance in developing a cost accounting management information
system for GT, IKR and KITE and in project preparation would be procured by
NBH following Bank Guidelines for consultant selection. Assistance for the
agricultural price policy study would be for travel to the Bank by senior
Hungarian team members for consultations as necessary. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that the above procurement procedures would be
followed.

G. Disbursements
4.28     Disbursements are expected to take place over a period of about three
and a half years. Although no previous disbursement pattern has been
established for Hungary, due to the existence of an experienced and well
organized state procurement unit and to the pent-up demand for the
investments, disbursements are expected to be completed without any unusual
delay.
4.29     Disbursement of the proposed Bank Loan of US$130.4 million would be
as follows:

Disbursements under all categories would be fully supported by standard
documentation. Assurances that these disbursement procedures would be
followed were obtained during negotiations.
4.30     The estimated annual disbursments of Bank funds would be as follows:

A more detailed disbursement schedule is given in Annex I, Table 2.  The
expected project completion and the IBRD loan closing dates would be June 30,
1986 and December 31, 1986 respectively.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organization and Management of the Project
Responsibilities For Implementation
5.01     NBH would be the borrower while the Government would assure provision
of adequate counterpart financing together with fertilizers and plant
protection chemicals required for project implementation. The counterpart
funds would be on-lent through NBH. NBH would make available to MEM that
portion of the Bank loan required to finance technical assistance for MEM
(US$0.214 million). NBH would have primary responsibility for project
implementation. The organization and management structure of the Department
of Agriculture of NBH is technically adequate to ensure successful project
implementation. The NBH branch offices would assist subloan applicants to
prepare loan requests and assure that their selection will be done on the
basis of project models and credit guidelines. The role of MEM would be one
of support to NBH in advising on technical aspects of subloan applications as
requested and specifically to review all grain storage subloan applications
with respect to location (paras 4.18 and 5.05). All project technical aspects
during project implementation would fall under the general authority of the
Directorate of Agriculture of MEM. The project financial and economic aspects
would be the responsibility of NBH. Assurances on the above points were
obtained during negotiations.
Project Account
5.02     To assure adequate financial control of operations, a separate Master
Project Account would be established at NBH headquarters, where procurement
and disposition of all machinery, equipment and services purchased under the
project would be recorded. In each NBH branch office and/or agency, a similar
project account would be established to record goods and services delivered to
the project beneficiaries, for which that specific office is responsible.
This would allow follow-up at headquarters of the progress in goods



- 32 -
deliveries, disbursements and provide information on the geographical location
of project beneficiaries. The account would be maintained after project
completion to assess credit recovery performance. Details of such account
have been discussed and agreed upon with NBH management and computer
specialists and a satisfactory outline of such an account was given to the
Bank during negotiations.
B. On-Lending Terms and Conditions
5.03     All subloans for the mechanization component would be extended under
the export promotion credit line. Subloans for the storage component would
fall under the agricultural development credit line. Under both credit line
procedures the subborrowers equity contribution to project financing has been
set at a minimum of 30%.
5.04     Subborrower selection for the mechanization component would be in
accordance with the current NBH export credit procedures (para 3.04). Under
such procedures project eligibility is based on cash flow models demonstrating
technical efficiency and foreign exchange earning potential. An eligible
investment should have a projected cash flow capable of generating the
equivalent of the subloan amount from foreign exchange earnings within four
years and a yield of at least 9% on its fixed assets and permanent working
capital. Under the Project, such analysis would be complemented by economic
rate of return (ERR) analysis. Prior to acceptance for financing under the
project, NBH would test all subprojects with internal ERR procedures. The ERR
cut-off point for acceptance of applications would be 14% - the current
interest rate charged by NBH. Assurances on this were obtained at
negotiations.
5.05     Subloan applications for the Grain Storage Component would also be
reviewed by MEM. Inflow-outflow analyses would be required with each
application to document the requirement for storage, to guide in the location
of storage to meet the most critical needs and to evaluate the utilization of
existing and proposed storage capacity. As a result, some metal silos for dry
grain storage may be located on-farm rather than off-farm.  The proposed
procedure, "Determination of storage allocation taking into consideration
present storage capacity utilization", is included in PIF Annex 5. "Joint
ventures" between the Grain Trust and other investors which allow for Grain
Trust participation in the construction of on-farm storage for holding their
grain would be eligible for project support. This minimizes the handling and
transportation of grain, allowing direct shipment from the point of production
to the processing enterprise. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that, as a condition of acceptance for financing, all grain storage
subprojects would be subject by MEM to a satisfactory review and analysis to
determine the least-cost location, which would be acceptable to the Bank.
5.06     To monitor the selection procedures, six sample subproject loan
applications and related technical and financial analysis would be submitted
to the Bank for review and acceptance prior to effectiveness. Two of these
projects would be under the mechanization component, two under the on-farm
storage component and two under the off-farm grain storage component.



- 33 -
5.07     Under the project, all credit financing of purchases of goods and
services by subborrowers would bear an unified interest rate of 14%. On
subloans for mechanization financed from domestic sources NBH would grant a
45% rebate on interest payments following achievement of the financial targets
outlined in para 5.04 for such investments. With a foreign exchange content
of 60% this would give an overall interest rate on mechanization subprojects
of 11.5%. Inflation rates during the past three years have ranged from 4.6 to
9% and the projected inflation rates through 1985 are not expected to exceed
8.5%, thus the on-lending rates would be positive. The foreign exchange risk
would be borne by the Borrower as presently required under Hungarian law. The
NBH on-lending margin of about 3% of Bank funds is more than adequate to cover
such risk, particularly in view of the absence of incremental operating costs
to NBH under the project.
5.08     Subloan maturities for the grain storage component would average
eight years, and be not less than six years and not more than ten years,
including one year of grace and for mechanization six years including one year
of grace. These maturities reflect the subborrowers' projected cash flow
availabilities and are within the periods currently set out in the NBH credit
guidelines. The repayment period of funds from the Bank loan by NBH would be
15 years including three years of grace. Subborrower repayments surplus to
the Bank debt repayment requirements of NBH would be utilized exclusively by
NBH to finance capital investments for agricultural development in Hungary.
Assurances as to the use of such surplus funds and to the application of the
above on-lending terms and conditions were obtained during negotiations.
C. Accounts and Audits
5.09     NBH's accounts are audited by independent auditors (para 3.16).  This
would be continued under the project and would be expanded to include annual
auditing of the project account (para. 5.02) and other related documents
submitted to the Bank in support of applications for reimbursement, with a
view to ascertaining whether or not these documents and the related internal
control procedures are sound. The project account would show operational
progress and the disbursement value of project funds. NBH would forward to
the Bank, within four months following the closing of the fiscal year, audited
project accounts, together with the audited balance sheets and income
statements covering its total operations. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations to this effect.
5.10     Auditing of subborrowers' accounts (para 3.22) under the project
would be carried out within 4 months of the end of every fiscal year and a
short form audit report prepared, both in accordance with Bank Guidelines.
All such audits should be of sufficient scope and timeliness so as to permit
assessment of the use of Project funds. These audit reports would be retained
by NBH and made available to Bank supervision missions. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations to this effect.
D. Monitoring and Evaluation
5.11     Project reports would be prepared quarterly by NBH and submitted to
the Bank within 45 days of the close of each quarter. MEM would contribute
all information on technical aspects as generated by its monitoring of



- 34 -
subborrower performance. The financial information would be supplied by NBH,
including progress in project disbursements and performance of project
beneficiaries. NBH in collaboration with MEM, would also prepare a project
completion report, acceptable to the Bank, to be submitted to the Bank not
later than six months after the project closing date. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations to this effect.
E. Environmental Impact
5.12     The project would not increase the area for grain production, and
there would be no displacement of other farmland. Adoption of more modern
practices would have a beneficial environmental impact through such measures
as improved on-farm grain stores, metal and steel silos with loading/unloading
and cleaning equipment and better equipment for tillage, planting,
fertilizing, spraying and harvesting. There would be no increase of pesticide
use and only a very moderate increase in fertilizer use. Any possible adverse
effect of increased use of fertilizers is expected to be minimized through
modern grain production management practices in their selection and
application. Hungary has an established legal control of environmental
pollution. The Plant Protection and Agro-Chemistry Center, under the Ministry
of Agriculture and Food Industry, is responsible for detecting environmental
pollution in the agricultural sector, and it pays special attention to
pesticide and fertilizer applications, chemical storage practices and chemical
tesidual controls.
VI. PROJECT BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Benefits and Markets
Benefits
6.01     Incremental output from the project would be in the form of increased
surpluses of wheat and maize due to increased production and a reduction in
harvest losses. Incremental output in grain equivalents due to the project is
expected to reach 0.9 million tons/year at full development (1986) as follows:
Table 6.1: SUMMARY OF MAJOR ANNUAL PROJECT INCREMENTAL BENEFITS

Note: Figures in parentheses are grain equivalents.



- 35 -
6.02     Benefits from the grain storage component would be from reduction of
grain storage losses in shifting grain from open or temporary storage to well
engineered permanent storage, which would permit scientific management and
care of grain stocks. Substantial savings in operating costs would also
accrue, since open and temporary storage costs are high in the use of labor
and expendable materials. Reductions in post harvest losses of 4.5% in maize
(10% to 5.5%) and 1.5% in wheat (from 4% to 2.5%) are assumed. OECD estimates
of storage losses in 1981 were 15 to 25%. MEM estimates were 12% for maize,
and mission field data collected gave values of 8 to 10% (PIF, Annex 5).
Wheat losses were estimated at 4%. Since storage loss of 1 to 2% are
representative of well-managed storage facilities, the loss reduction
assumptions are considered conservative.
6.03     For the farm mechanization component, as a result of the improved
cultural and harvesting practices to be applied through the use of improved
machinery and equipment, yields of wheat and maize are expected to increase by
0.8 and 1.25 tons per ha, respectively, from various without project baseline
levels depending on soil and other conditions. Overall average without
project yields have been assumed in farm models to be 4.5 tons/ha for wheat
and 5.0 tons/ha for maize. An additional 0.375 tons and 4.0 tons/per ha of
straw and silage, respectively, would also be obtained. Incremental annual
yields and production would amount to an average of 18% for wheat, 25% for
maize and straw, and 14% for silage. With the new technology to be introduced
under the project, individual farms have reached higher levels of production,
but the projections for the project have been kept below the actual average
increase reported to allow for the variable quality of soils and managerial
capacity in parts of the project area. Incremental investments, operating
costs and output projections have been phased over two years. Because of the
current shortage in high quality machinery, the availability of adequate
institutional support and high standards of operating and maintenance skills
in Hungary, rapid absorption of the new project equipment is expected.
6.04     An additional major project benefit is expected through a reduction
in imported diesel fuel consumption for the grain storage and mechanization
components of some 19,000 tons annually at full development (1986) with a
border price value of some US$7.6 million in 1983 terms. This saving is
offset by a net annual increase in consumption of domestically produced
electricity of 57,158 megawatt hours, which is priced in domestic terms at Ft
2.2/kwh (US$0.055/kwh). Since the domestic price is virtually equal to
comparable border prices for this, the financial and economic value of this
electricity is US$3.1 million (in 1983 terms). The net annual energy savings
expected are thus valued at about US$4.5 million. Details on the project's
balance are contained in Annex V, Table 1.
Markets
6.05     Since Hungary is a net exporter of wheat and maize, the entire
incremental grain surplus arising under the project is expected to be
exported. Maize silage, valued in Table 6.1 at its grain equivalent
opportunity cost, would be used primarily to produce beef and dairy products,
of which Hungary is also a net exporter. In terms of world trade volume,
Hungary is a very minor grain export source obtaining internationally
determined prices for its grain exports plus whatever premium it can negotiate



- 36 -
based on quality and location to nearby import markets. Current commodity
price projections /1 indicate that international prices of wheat and maize are
now at the low point of their present cycles and are expected to trend upwards
to 1990. Wheat and maize price projections show a flat trend from 1990 to
1995. Actual export market management, including institutions and the
formation of prices, is detailed in PIF, Annex 3, while actual prices used in
the analysis are given in Annex III, Tables 2, 3, and 4.
B. Financial Analysis
6.06     Financial benefits would be derived from reduction of grain storage
losses, operating cost savings and output increases due to higher productivity
from the utilization of more technologically advanced machinery and
equipment. The financial analysis has been carried out on the basis of the
incremental operating revenue, and operating costs and investment costs (PIF,
Annex 2) of three typical storage models and one mechanization model. The
storage models are as follows: (a) on-farm dry grain storage and handling; (b)
off-farm dry grain storage and handling; and (c) wet maize storage and feed
preparation. The analysis of the mechanization model is based on revenue and
costs of the average size plot of 1,250 ha of cereals farmland cultivated
under IGPP, as expected under the Project. All subprojects have a
satisfactory FRR (see Table 6.2). Sensitivity analysis in the form of
variation in cost and benefits confirm these results. The expected financial
rate of return to the on-farm storage model is about 30%. The off-farm
storage model FRR is estimated to be about 24%. Benefits from the wet maize
storage model are derived from reduced drying costs and to a lesser extent
reduced storage losses. The FRR is estimated at about 34%.
6.07     Under the mechanization model, financial benefits would be mainly
obtained from use of improved technology which is expected to increase crop
yields by about 22%. Operating cost savings are also expected. The FRR of
the mechanization model is about 18%.  All above models show adequate cash
flow balances for purposes of credit recovery.

6.08     Foreign Exchange Earnings.  The estimated annual gross incremental
foreign exchange earnings from the project at full development (1986) are
shown by source in Table 6.3 below:
Table 6.3 ESTIMATED GROSS FOREIGN EXCHANGE EARNINGS
AT FULL DEVELOPMENT - 1986 (IN 1983 TERMS)

/a Valued in grain equivalents
The total of US$141 million expressed in border price terms is the expected
increased gross foreign exchange earnings accruing to the economy as a result
of the project at full development (1986). The domestic price equivalent of
US$81 million is the value of the increased revenue accruing to the
subborrowers.  The difference of US460 million accrues directly to the State
by virtue of its agricultural pricing policy. At full development replacement
and operating costs are 45% of revenues and would have a foreign exchange
content of approximately 40%, resulting in an 18% foreign exchange import
content in total revenue. Thus the annual net incremental foreign exchange
earnings from the project at full development are expected to be of the order
of US$115 million.
C. Economic Evaluation
6.09     Economic Prices.  These are based on the border prices for all traded
products. Thus, traded products and inputs have been priced at their
international equivalents, adjusted for quality differentials and
transportation costs. Only wheat straw, among the outputs, has been priced at
its domestic value as it is non-traded. Concerning inputs, electricity,
construction and labor have all been priced at their domestic values, which
under the project are equal to their international equivalents. Diesel fuel
oil and fertilizers have been priced on the basis of their border
equivalents. Investment costs for items expected to be imported have been
based on manufacturer's quotes (January 1983) plus transportation and
insurance costs, while items expected to be procured locally have been priced
at current domestic values, excluding all direct subsidies and taxes. Changes
in international prices of inputs and products, as forecast by the Bank's
Commodities and Export Projections Division, have been incorporated over
time. Actual output and recurrent input prices used, together with their
derivation, are presented in Annex II, Tables 2, 3 and 4. The detailed
determination of the border prices for wheat and maize is given in the PIF,
Annex 3.
6.10     Economic Benefits.  The quantified benefits comprise loss reductions
in wheat and maize, operating cost savings in diesel fuel and labor from on-
and off-farm grain storage and handling equipment, and increased production of
wheat, maize, maize silage and wheat straw from increased on-farm



- 38 -
mechanization. Also included as a benefit is the net reduction in replacement
costs of older types of machinery which would have occurred without the
project.  Benefits are lagged one year behind costs in estimating the ERR to
the overall project and to each component, to allow for procurement of capital
inputs. Sensitivity analysis centers around estimation of the switching
values to determine the maximum shift permissible in key streams and
coefficients concommitant with a viable project. To apply this criterion an
opportunity cost of capital (OCC) of 12% is assumed. Benefit lags are
estimated to assess the impact of possible implementation delays. Finally,
net present values (NPVs) are calculated for all net benefit streams. The
results are summarized in Table 6.4 below and detailed in Annex III, Table 5.

/a  Detailed results presented in Annex III, Table 5.
6.11     The overall economic rate of return (ERR) of the project was
calculated to be 24%.  This relatively high return is not due solely to the
loss reductions from storage and the yield increases in production, both of
which are quite modest, but also to the reduction in operating costs,
particularly in fuel oil use. Major sources of these savings are grain
handling and wheat production. Other sources are the new and modernized flat
and silo grain stores, but these are offset to some extent by increases in
electricity use. Although electricity is priced in domestic terms at the
equivalent of US$0.6 cents/kwh in 1983, this is comparable to prices charged
in market economies where electricity is traded.



- 39 -
6.12     Mechanization is the most sensitive of the three components to
changes in costs.  Here total costs would have to increase by over 20%, and
investment and operating costs by 31% and 67% respectively independently of
each other, before the ERR for the component would decline to an opportunity
cost of capital (OCC) of 12%. Errors of this magnitude in cost estimation are
most unlikely in view of the very standard off-the-shelf equipment involved.
Total benefits under the project could decline by up to 27% before the rate of
return would decline to 12%. Given the conservative estimates of the benefits
of grain storage and mechanization that have been used in the analysis, such a
decline in benefits is also considered most unlikely. All components of the
project are, however, very sensitive to delays in receipt of the benefits. In
the case of a 2 year lag in the flow of benefits over the entire project, the
rate of return declines to 14%. For this to occur, a major investment in
grain storage or mechanization would need to remain completely unutilized for
two years, which, again, in view of the current high demand for such
investment and the high caliber of farm enterprise management is unlikely.
D. Risks
6.13     Because the Government and the potential subborrowers are committed
to the Project, which is part of an on-going successful investment program,
the risks that the project would be unsuccessful appear small. Exogenous
risks are the weather, and international grain prices. The Project is
designed to assist in reducing weather related losses. The exception to this
is wheat killing frosts; but the average occurrence of these is only once in
every 10 years and such an occurence would have only a very marginal effect on
project success. The Project has been assessed at a relatively low point in
the current international commodity price cycle, consequently downward price
movement is likely to be small. Endogenous risks relate to possible
implementation delays arising from lack of familiarity with Bank procurement
procedures, the possibility that unfamiliar types of tractors and machinery
would be acquired as a result of Bank ICB and the inadequacy of the financial
management in GT. Due to the committment of the Government and subborrowers,
the first two of these risks should, at worst, create only temporary delays as
adjustment takes place. Concerning GT, poor financial management is unlikely
to cause implementation delays by equipment users, however, it could give rise
to slower subloan repayments to NBH.
VII. SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS AT NEGOTIATIONS AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01     During negotiations assurances were obtained that:
(a) the Government would ensure that an adequate stock of the
necessary fertilizers and plant chemicals for grain production is
maintained and made available to project farms (para 4.05);
(b) MEM would select and send for training abroad in grain storage
and handling six suitably qualified persons acceptable to the
Bank and would establish a local training facility for training
on-farm personnel in grain storage. Also MEM would arrange 4 - 6
short study tours abroad in connection with grain production
mechanization (paras 4.12, 4.16 and 4.27);



- 40 -
(c) NBH would arrange consultant assistance acceptable to the Bank to
design a cost accounting Management Information System for GT,
IKR and KITE and would retain a qualified consultant to assist in
developing project preparation capacity in NBH both in accordance
with Bank Guidelines for the selection of consultants (paras
4.13, 4.16 and 4.27);
(d) the Government would carry out an agricultural price policy study
within a terms of reference and time framework and with a team of
suitably qualified economists all acceptable to the Bank. The
first phase of the study covering grain, would be completed and
furnished to the Bank by September 1984 and Phase 2, covering all
other major agricultural commodities produced in Hungary, would
be completed and furnished to the Bank by September 1985 (paras
4.15, 4.16 and 4.27);
(e) adequate counterpart financing would be made available, to be
on-lent through NBH (paras 4.22 and 5.01);
(f) all goods and equipment for the project to be financed by the
Bank, together with US$15 million of fertilizers and plant
protection chemicals, would be procured through ICB in accordance
with Bank Procurement Guidelines. Technical assistance services
would be procured in accordance with Bank Consultant Guidelines
under procedures acceptable to the Bank (paras 4.23, 4.24, 4.25
and 4.27);
(g) all disbursements would be fully supported by standard
documentation (para 4.29);
(h) MEM would advise on all technical aspects of Project management
and implementation (para 5.01);
(i) prior to acceptance for financing NBH would subject all
subprojects under the project to internal economic rate of return
analysis as part of its standard appraisal and apply a cut-off
point of 14% as a minimal acceptance criterion (para 5.04);
(j) as a condition of acceptance for financing, all grain storage
subprojects would be subject to satisfactory review and analysis
by MEM, to determine the least cost location, acceptable to the
Bank (para 5.05);
(k) NBH would on-lend all project funds to subborrowers at 14%.
Subloan maturities would average eight years and be not less than
six years and not greater than ten years, including one year's
grace, for grain storage and six years including one year's grace
for mechanization. Surplus funds available during repayment of
the Bank loan amount would be used exclusively by NBH to finance
capital investments for agricultural development in Hungary
(paras 5.07 and 5.08);

(1) NBH would maintain a separate project account, which would be
audited annually and the results sent to the Bank, together with
audited financial statements of its total operation, within four
months following the close of the fiscal year (paras 5.02 and
5.09);
(m) all subborrowers under the project would be fully audited on an
annual basis within four months of the end of each fiscal year
and a short form audit report would be prepared, both in
accordance with World Bank Guidelines. These would be retained by
NBH and made available to Bank supervision missions (para 5.10);
and
(n) NBH, assisted by MEM, would prepare quarterly project progress
reports acceptable to the Bank, and submit these to the Bank
within 45 days of the close of each quarter and would also
prepare a project completion report acceptable to the Bank and
submit it to the Bank within six months of the project closing
date (para 5.11).
7.02     A condition of effectiveness would be that NBH would submit six
sample subproject appraisals to the Bank, two from each project component, for
review and acceptance prior to effectiveness of the project (para 5.06).
7.03     With the above assurances and conditions the Grain Storage and
Mechanization Project is suitable for a Bank Loan of US$130 million with
repayment over 15 years and with a grace period of 3 years. The Project
Completion date will be June 30, 1986.

ANNEX IV
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
THE HUNGARIAN PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC
GRAIN STORAGE AND MECHANIZATION PROJECT
Establishment of a Cost Accounting Management
Information System for the Grain Trust and IKR
A. Purpose
A management information system (MIS) would be designed for the
Grain Trust and IKR to determine costs of different activities and cost
centers, compare them to the related income, and provide Management with a
more accurate basis for investment and operational decisions.
B. Outline Terms of Reference for Consultants:
(i)   review present system of accounting;
(ii)   analyze the overall activity of the enterprise, determine the
component parts and identify cost centers;
(iii)   determine how amounts shown in present accounts can be allocated to
cost accounts for each cost center and the basis for such
allocation. A distinction should be made between direct and
indirect costs;
(iv) draw up a manual;
(v) design internal audit;
(vi) design a suitable Training Program.
C. Consultant services would be recruited for the first two years of project
implementation. A preliminary cost estimate for the establishment of the
system is about US$300,000.
