FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(CREDIT 1481-LSO)
PREFACE
1.    This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fourth Highway Project
in Lesotho, for which Credit 1481-LSO in the amount of SDR 14.3 million (US$15.2
million equivalent) was approved on May 24, 1984.  The Credit was closed on
August 31, 1991, three years behind schedule.  A total of SDR 14.16 million was
disbursed, and the balance of SDR 0.14 million was cancelled; the last disburse-
ment was made on December 31, 1991. The project was co-financed by the African
Development Fund (AfDF) which provided funding in the amount of US$8.6 million
equivalent.
2.    This PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division, Southern
Africa Department, Africa Region (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Part I and III)
and the Borrower (Part II).
3.    Preparation of the PCR was initiated during the Association's final
supervision mission of the Project in October 1991, and is based inter alia on
the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), the Development Credit Agreement, supervision
reports, correspondence between IDA and the Borrower and internal IDA memoranda.

FOURTH HIGhWAY PROJECT
(CREDIT 1481-LSO)
EVALUATION SUMR
1.    Objectives:  The general project objectives were to lower transport costs
and increase accessibility of rural areas, as well as to assist the Government
in its institution-building efforts in the transport sector in line with its
general policy objective of employment generation. The project was successful
in meeting the main objective of improving the condition of roads while the
objectives related to training of local professional staff for the Roads Branch
(RB) and Public Vehicles and Plant Services (PVPS), and enforcement of Axle Load
Control were only partially fulfilled.   The shortfall in meeting the latter
objectives was caused by Government's inability to retain the trained staff and
failure to start enforcement of Axle Load Control.
2.    Implementation Experience:  RB of Ministry of Works (MOW) was able to
exceed the originally estimated physical targets set for the regravelling and
upgrading of earth roads to gravel standard.  However, the rehabilitation of
paved roads by contract was completed two years behind schedule and at a higher
cost than estimated at appraisal.   This was due mainly to changes in design
standards set for the urban section of the roads and the shoulders of the
rehabilitated paved roads. The Borrower was able to process procurement of works,
goods and services on schedule and complied with all covenants, even though there
were delays in the submission of audit reports. The Bank's project supervision
performance at both the field and headquarters levels was good, and contributed
to the successful completion of the project.   The Bank and thp Borrower
maintained a good relationship throughout the project implementation period.
3.    Results:  Achievements under civil works which made up 792 of the total
project cost were higher than originally planned. Technical assistance personnel
for RB and PVPS were put in place on time and performance was satisfactory. The
supervision consultants financed by AfDF, had difficulty in completing the design
of the urban section of the paved road rehabilitation component and in the
submission of the progress reports in the early stages of the contract.  The
Government noticed a number of discrepancies and brought them to the attention
of the consultant. However, to date it has received no response to its queries.
The building of institutional capacity was hampered by the loss, to the private
sector, of engineers trained under the project. The re-evaluated economic rate
of return (ERR) of the rehabilitation component for Project I (19.5 km stretch
from Maseru to Masianokeng) was estimated at 12.4Z as compared with the appraisal
estimate of 16.4Z. The ERR of the rehabilitation component for Project II (88
km stretch from Leribe to Maseru) has been re-evaluated at 31.12 as compared with
the original estimate of 22.7Z. The ERRs of the regravelling and upgrading



iii.
components, originally estimated at 15.8Z and 16.2? respectively, have been re-
evaluated at 4;.i.8Z and 16.9X respectively.
4.    Sustainabilitys  The sustainability of benefits derived from the project
will depend ont (i) Government provision of adequate funding for road maintenance
in the future; (ii) the ability of RB to retain trained staff; and (iii) the
stringent enforcement of Axle Load Control, not only as a preventative measure
but as a means to reducing the budgetary burden of road maintenance on Government
in the lorg-term.
5.    Findings and Lessons Learned:
(i)   The accomplishments of both the equipment- and labor-intensive
brigades involved in the regravelling and upgrading operations of unpaved
roads were commendable. However, a follow-up project would ensure that
the capacity developed by the brigades under the project would have a
sustained positive effect on the sub-sector.
(ii) The institutional capacity of the highways sub-sector has been
hampered by the loss of engineers trained under the project to the private
sector.   Government has attempted to provide trained engineers with
incentives to remain in the public sector as part of its Civil Service
Reform package. However, until this flow is stemmed the maintenance of
roads will continue to be negatively affected.
(iii) The importance of effective enforcement of Axle Load Control to
levels applied in the design of the roads does not seem to be fully
understood by concerned officials, and failure to implement such control
could deprive Lesotho of the benefits of the investments made in its road
infrastructure.

2.    Background
2.01        Highly mountainous with rugged terrain and wintry conditions in the
highlands, Lesotho depends almost exclusively on road and air transport for
internal transport. The country has no navigable rivers and no railway except
for a short (2 km) rail link operated by South Africa Railways from the South
African border to Maseru.   While the domestic air service is reasonably
effective, the road network is inadequate in length and condition, particularly
in the eastern region of the country. Much of the network is poorly maintained
and many roads can be traversed only in the dry season, and even then only by
four-wheel drive vehicles.
2.02        The road network, totalling about 5,000 km, consists of 2,500 km
classified roads (800 km of which are bitumen surfaced and 1,700 km gravel
surfaced) and 2,500 km unclassified roads. The Roads Branch (RB) of the Ministry
of Works (MOW) is responsible for the maintenance of the 2,500 km of classified
roads.   The Civil Works Section of the Ministry of Interior, Chieftainship
Affairs and Rural Development (MICRD), using labor employed under the Food for
Work Programme and sometimes cash, is in charge of construction and maintenance
of most earth tracks and foot bridges in the count.-y's outback; and the Ministry
of Agriculture and Marketing (MOA) is responsible for construction of about 200
km of feeder roads.



-2-
2.03        In the 1960s and early 1970s, the principal focus of transport policy
was on serving the main population and production centers along the north-south
lowland corridor along the western border. In the mid-1970s, Government began
to extend the road network to the eastern mountain areas in an effort to develop
their full socio-economic potential and promote the political and administrative
integration of the country.   At this time, two other objectives guided the
formulation of transport policy in Lesotho. Namely, ti) to increase employment
generation; and (ii) to reduce dependence on South Africa. (The Labor-Intensive
Construction Unit (LCU), established with IDA assistance under the Second Highway
Project (Credit 619-LSO, US$5.5 million, 1976) supported both these objectives).
2.04        IDA's support for Government's policy in the highway subsector began
in 1966 with a credit of US$4.1 million (Credit 82-BL) to help finance the
construction of 107 km of the main North-South road from Leribe to the
Masianokeng turnoff, and a 27 km gravel road between Leribe and Pitseng.  The
works were completed satisfactorily for less than the estimated costs, and the
savings were used to pave a further 6 km section.  Including this project, IDA
has financed four highway projects (Table 1), the main objectives of which have
focussed on improving the condition and standard of the roads, establishing of
labor and eq'ipment-intensive construction brigades, institutional strengthening
of RB and PVPS, training of RB and PVPS staff, provision for field office
construction, purchasing and installing weighbridges, purchasing maintenance
equipment and spare parts, technical assistance to RB and PVPS in civil and
mechanical engineering, and consultant services for engineering design and
contract supervision. The Fourth Highway Project continued the support given by
IDA to the Government in developing its road network in line with its economic
policy of increasing employment generation through the use of labor-intensive
work methods.
3.    Project Objectives and Description
3.01        Proiect Obiectives:  The objactives of the Fourth Highway Project
were to lower transport costs and increase accessibility of rural areas, as well
as to assist the Government in its institution-building efforts in the transport
sector in line with its general policy objective of employment generation.
3.02        Project Description:   The project  consisted  of  the  following
components:
(a)         rehabilitation of two paved road  sections:  one urban/suburban
section from about the 6 km point north of Haseru, via Maseru to
Masianokeng (Project I, 19.5 km) and one rural section from Leribe
to a point 6 km north of Maseru (Project II, 88 km); plus the
construction of two bridges on the road from Masianokeng to
Mafeteng;
(b)         regravelling of 360 km of gravel roads, upgrading from earth to
gravel standards of 42 km, and the improvement of drainage on 123 km
of gravel roads;



-3-
(c)         procurement of traffic counters and weighbridges; and
(d)         technlcal assistance (including a study of the domestic construction
industry), training and fellowships.
4.    Proiect Design and Organization
4.01        Conceptual Foundations The project components were developed through
an in-depth assessment of the priorities in the sector. The paved road component
was aimed at improving the condition of the most important and highly trafficked
roads. The strengthening of the institutional capacity of both the labor- and
equipment-intensive brigades, staff training and technical assistance were
components conceptually based on lessons learned under the previous projects.
4.02        Scope and Scales Through a feasibility study during the preparation
phase, a total of 190 km of paved roads were identified as economically viable
for reh--;,litation.   However, funds available from GOL, IDA and AfDF were
sufficient to cover the renabilitation of only 107 km of the high priority roads.
4.03        Roles and Responsibilities  of Institutions and Agencies:   The
Government agencies involved in the design and execution of the project were RB,
LCU and PVPS for all road-related components and the traffic police for
enforcement of Axle Load Control. All of the relevant agencies contributed to
project design.
5.   Prolect Implementation
5.01        Credit Effectivenesss  The Credit was approved on May 24, 1984 and
became effective on November 13, 1984, after an extension of the effectiveness
date one month. Force account works and the contract for rehabilitation of paved
roads were started immediately after Credit effectiveness as the processing of
procurement had been carried out in advance under a Project Preparation Facility
(PPF).
5.02        Implementation Schedule: The project was completed in February 1991
and the Credit was closed on August 31, 1991 (after two extensions), two and a
half years after the originally scheduled date. The extensions were necessary
in order to allow completion of the rehabilitation of the paved roads and to
carry out bitumen paving of the gravel surfaced shoulders of the rehabilitated
roads. Due to a shortage of experienced Basotho engineers, the contracts of two
technical assistance engineers were extended up to the end of August 1991.
5.03        Decisions and Actions during Project Implementations  The decision
to bituminize the surface of the gravel shoulders of the rehabilitated paved
roads was technically and economically justified due to the extensive and fast
wear of the shoulders in heavily trafficked sections. The revision of pavement:



4
design for the urban section with a dual carriageway was also appropriate in view
of the resulting aignificant savings in maintenance costs and excellent riding
quality.   The design of the urban section of the paved road rehabilitation
component was revised to include the provision of suitable run-off drainage,
pedestrian foot-paths, a roundabout, and speed limit rumble strips.   These
changes are expected to improve safety and environmental conditions.
5.04        Disbursements:  The annual disbursements under Credit 1481-LSO are
given in Table 3 in Part III. By the original Closing Date, disbursements under
the project amounted to 74Z of the SAR estimate. This percentage would have been
higher had the bitumen paving of shoulders been included in the original
engineering design and the design of the urban section been completed on time.
A total of SDR 14.16 million was disbursed, and the balance of SDR 0.14 million
was cancelled; the last disbursement was made on December 31, 1991.
5.05        Project Cost: Details of the project cost as provided by Government,
and reviewed by the Bank, are given in Table 5 in Part III. The actual total
project cost of US$32.20 million is 142 higher than the appraisal estimate of
US$28.23 million with the actual Maloti cost of 65.74 million being 94Z higher
than the appraisal estimate, mainly due to exchange rate fluctuations.
5.06        Proiect Risks:   Project risks identified during appraisal were
related to those elements requiring substantial local technical and managerial
inputs. These elements included: (i) the road improvement component, and, in
particular, the labor-intensive road improvement operation (through LCU), and
(ii) the traffic count and Axle Load Control programs.  In addition, the training
component of the project was considered risky since it was not certain that
trained local staff would stay with MOW or even in Lesotho. Although sufficient
local staff were trained abroad under the project, the turnover of those leaving
RB and PVPS to join the private sector, both in Lesotho and South Africa, was
considerably high. While the risk related to LCU did not materialize, those
related to the traffic count program and the enforcement of the Axle Load Control
made for persistent problems. Even though stationary weighbridges were installed
and mobile weigh-scales were purchased two years prior to project completion, the
training and establishment of Axle Load Control teams did not take place.
6.    Project Results
6.01        Overall Proiect Impact: The main project objectives relating to road
rehabilitation, regravelling, upgrading ef earth roads to gravel surface were
fully achieved. However, the improvement of drainage structures was only 502
completed. Design standards on the urban section of the paved road rehabilita-
tion component were improved and gravel surfaced shoulders were later bitumin-
ized. The design improvem.ents were established to be technically and economic-
ally jastified and have made a significant contribution towards reducing future
maintenance costs.
6.02        Economic Impact:  At appraisal, economic evaluation of benefits in
quantitative terms was limited to the rehabilitation and improvement components



which together accounted for approximately 902 of total project costs.  At
appraisal, the economic rate of return for the rehabilitation of paved roads in
Project I (19.5 km stretch from 6 km north of Maseru to Masianokeng) was
estimated at 16.42. and that for Project II (88 km stretch from Leribe to 6 km
north of Maseru) at 22.72.  Justifications for these estimates rested on the
expected prevention of further deterioration of the roads, the reduction of
transport costs and to some degree, the avoidance of sharply higher future costs
of rehabilitation and/or maintenance. The regravelling and upgrading components
were originally estimated to have ERRs of 15.82 and 16.2Z respectively. These
estimates were made on the basis of anticipated vehicle operating and transport
cost savings. The economic re-evaluation estimates ERRs of 12.4Z for Project I,
31.12 for Project II and 40.82 and 16.92 for the regravelling and upgrading
components.
6.03        Paved Roads Component:  Work on the contract for rehabilitation of
the 19.5 km section of paved road from 6 km north of Maseru to Hasianokeng and
construction of two bridges (Project I) was completed in February 1988 (17 months
after the estimated completion date) at a total cost 1172 above the cost
estimated at appraisal (US$14.2 million). Changes in the design of the 3.8 km
urban section with a dual carriageway accounted for both the increase in cost and
the delay in completion of this component.   These  changes were made  to
accommodate necessary drainage features, the provision of pedestrian sidewalks
and the use of asphalt concrete surfacing instead of double surface treatment.
Work on the contract for the AfDF-financed paved road rehabilitation component
(Project II) was completed at the same time at a cost 7.52 higher than estimated
at appraisal.
6.04        Regravelling of Gravel Roads by Equipment-Intensive Brigades:  The
standard and quality of the regravelling work carried out was satisfactory. The
equipment-intensive brigade completed 373 km exceeding the appraisal target of
297 km by about 252 at a total cost of M 9.69 million (about US$2.89 million),
1502 higher than that estimated at appraisal. The brigades' production rate was
about 55 km per year compared to the appraisal estimate of 100 km per year. This
is still judged satisfactory considering the abnormally severe climactic
conditions and prolonged rainy season during the first three years of project
implementation.
6.05        Upgrading of Earth Surfaced Roads to Gravel Standards  The labor-
intensive brigade completed the SAR regravelling target of 63 km and the
upgrading target of 42 km (total 105 km) in five years instead of the three years
estimated at appraisal. Its production rate was 25 km per year at an average
cost of M21,000 per km as compared with the appraisal estimate of 35 km per year
at M23,110 per km.  The work was of a lower quality and standard than that of the
equipment-intensive brigade.
6.06        Improvement of Drainage:  The culverting unit completed 120 culverts
and 6 fords compared to the appraisal estimate of 238 culverts and 12 fords and
expenditure on this component was 182 higher than the appraisal estimate.



-6-
6.07        Domestic Construction Industry Study:   The consultant engaged to
carry out the domestic construction industry completed the study and submitted
the draft final report. A strategy document on the development of the local
construction industry was prepared.   Implementation of the recommendations
contained in this report has been proposed for inclusion in the Infrastructure
Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project to be financed by IDA.
6.08        Weighbridges and Traffic Counters:  Under the project, two mobile
weighing scales were purchased and two stationary weighbridges were purchased and
installed. Also, three vehicles were purchased for use by the Axle Load Control
teams.   However, two years after the weighbridges were ready for use, the
mobilization and training of Axle Load Control teams had not taken place.
6.09        Fellowship and In-Country Training:  A total of 43 candidates from
RB, PVPS and MOW were sent abroad for training at both the undergraduate and
graduate levels. RB has not been able to fill all the positions authorized under
the project since several graduate civil and mechanical engineers trained under
the project left MOW to join the private sector both in Lesotho and South Africa.
Therefore, RB continued using technical assistance staff to carry out most of the
engineering tasks under the project. PVPS, on the other hand, has been able to
man all its positions locally.
6.10        Technical Assistance:   Under the project RB and PVPS have each
received about 200 man-months of technical assistance at a total cost of about
H 5.92 million (about US$2.69 million) compared to the SAR estimate of US$1.8
million. The increase in technical assistance expenditures was necessitated by
the continued shortage of experienced Basotho civil and mechanical engineers.
6.11        Purchase of Equipment: Equipment valued at US$0.73 million compared
to the appraisal estimate of US$0.93 million was purchased under the project.
7.    Proiect Sustainability
7.01        Economic Benefit:  The sustainability of benefits derived from the
project will depend on the adequate and timely maintenance of roads. Supervision
missions noted that routine maintenance was not being carried out on regravelled
and upgraded roads completed early on in project implementation. Also, budgetary
allocations for maintenance over the course of implementation averaged only 70Z
of required amounts. Under such circumstances it is unlikely that the Government
will be able to retain the re-evaluated benefits over the economic life of the
roads.   The stringent enforcement of Axle Load Controls could be of some
assistance not only as a preventive measure but as a means of reducing the future
budgetary burden on Government with respect to road maintenance.

8.    IDA Performance
8.01        Performance in the Early Stage: At the time of project identifica-
tion, the Government was carrying out investigations into the structural strength
of pavements of the main paved roads. Under a PPF advance, feasibility studies
and detailed engineering of the paved roads rehabilitation were carried out. The
Government, assisted by a consultant completed Phase I of the detailed
engineering of the selected paved roads and the Bank carried out a preappraisal
mission in September/October lV83. The Credit was negotiated in February 1984,
approved on May 25, 1984, and became effective on November 13, 1984. Considering
the extent of the overlap between the Third and Fourth Highway projects, the time
taken from preparation to Credit effectiveness was considered reasonable.
Because of actions taken during the project processing period to complete the
detailed engineering, preparation of procurement documents and tendering of bids
for the rehabilitation of paved roads, it was possible to award contracts two
months before the Credit Effectiveness date.
8.02        Supervision Performances Supervision was carried out regularly over
the six years of project implementation, averaging about 1.7 missions per year
with the time spent in the field averaging six days per mission. Bank missions
asaisted the Government in resolving critical technical issues, including the
modification of design standards, assessment of the quality of works carried out
and the improvement of force account brigade performance.
8.03        Main Lessons of Experience:
(i)         Reports from supervision missions indicated that maintenance funds
had been about 702 of requirements, with most of the shortfall
coming out of operating expenses rather than salaries.   In the
absence of adequate provision for road maintenance, it will not be
possible to justify future investments in road infrastructure. A
review of the organizational structure of RB as well as the
introduction of an effective road maintenance performance and
budgeting system is neededl/. Follow-up projects should emphasize
the need to correct the problems and constraints which have adverse
effects on road maintenance.
(ii)        The shortage of experienced Basotho civil engineers will continue to
plague RB as long as there is a significant gap in remuneration
between the public and private sectors, and the Government will have
to continue using donor-funded expatriate civil engineers to cover
the shortfall. Under such conditions, institution-building using
local personnel will remain unattainable.
(iii)       Despite the efforts of IDA, enforcement of Axle Load Control has not
been undertaken by the Government.   In the absence of Axle Load
Control, the Government is bound to lose the investments made in
rehabilitating, regravelling and upgrading the roads in a period
1/    A pavement and maintenance management system will be put in place under
the Infrastructure Engineering Project, for which negotiations were
completed in early May 1992.



shorter than the design life of the roads.   Thus, it would seem
appropriate to make the start of Axle Load Control operations a
condition in any follow-up project.l/
9.    Borrower Performance
9.01        Project Preparation and Start-Up: The Government's decision to carry
out an investigation of the structural strength of pavements (financed using
local funds) significantly helped to speed up project preparation, as did its
decision to have the procurement of the paved roads contract completed prior to
Credit effectiveness.  The work programs prepared by RB for regravelling and
upgrading works by the equipment and labor-intensive brigades and culverting
units were adequate, sound and completed on schedule.
9.02        Project Implementations   The performance of RB's equipment- and
labor-intensive brigades was good.   PVPS, supported by a technical assistance
team, was able to improve the percentage of its equipment availability to 75?,
compared to less than 50? prior to the input under the project, and was also able
to introduce an effective management system. Even though PVPS has lost several
of its staff trained under the project, it was able to maintain its level of
efficiency after the departure of the technical assistance team.  RB made an
effort to train sufficient civil engineers under the project, but a number of
trained staff were lost to the private sector. Unlike PVPS, RB had a shortage
of experienced civil engineers to cope with the work load, and continued to
depend on expatriate engineers. Even though weighbridges were made available
under the project, the enforcement of Axle Load Control did not take place.
9.03        Decisions  taken  during  Implementation:    Because  of  the  fast
deterioration of the gravel surfaced shoulders of the heavily trafficked sections
of the rehabilitated paved roads, Government requested and IDA agreed to have the
shoulders bitumen surfaced. This decision was technically sound and cost effect-
ive, especially since road maintenance funds were not adequate.
9.04        Road Maintenance:    Budgetary allocations  for maintenance were
inadequate over the course of implementation [see para. 8.03 (i)].
10.   Project Relationships
10.01       Bank  staff  and  officials  of  the  Government  involved  in  the
implementation of the project enjoyed an amiable and highly professional working
relationship. The project benefited from the high level of continuity in the
supervisory staff assigned to it as well as from the vast professional experience
of the individuals.
1/    Enforcement of axle load control is proposed as part of the conditionality
package for the proposed Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Maintenance
Project (FY94).



-9-
11.   Consulting Services
11.01       Supervision of the IDA-financed paved road rehabilitation contract
was financed by AfDF. The detailed engineering design for the urban section of
the rehabilitated paved roads and revisions to the original design were carried
out by the supervision consultants. There was a protracted delay in carrying out
the required revisions and as a result, the operations of the contractor were
interrupted and a claim later submitted.
12.   Proiect Documentation and Data
12.01       The Loan Agreement provided adequate guidance in project management
and implementation. There were no distinguishable delays in the submission of
withdrawal applications. However, this was not the case regarding the submission
of both audit and consultant progress reports.

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(CREDIT 1481-LSO)
PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1.          IDA'S PERFORMANCE DURING EVALUATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
1.01        Performance of IDA in the Early Stages
The provision of the Project Preparation Facility (PPF), advanced by IDA
during the project identification stage immensely helped Government to fast-track
that process. As a result, it was possible to put the project in shape much
earlier by preparing tender documents and engaging technical assistance for the
RB. This cooperation and understanding from the Bank was highly appreciated by
Government.
1.02        Supervision Performance
The personnel assigned by IDA to supervise this project was highly
experienced technically and this resulted in the timely solution of critical
technical problems. From the outset, this team struck an amiable professional
relationship with the RB officers who were assigned to implement the project.
1.03        Main Lessons of Experience
(i)    The provision of the PPF at an early stage greatly enhanced the
project implementation. This practice should be continued, where
necessary, in the future as it has proved beneficial in this project.
(ii)    The timing and frequency of the supervision missions also played
a significant role on the performance of the project. It was possible to
solve a lot of critical technical problems on the spot thus achieving time
savings on project implementation.
(iii)   The amiable relationship between the RB officials and IDA' s
supervision staff also contributed heavily towards the successful
completion of this project.



- 12. -
2.          GOVERNMENT'S PERFORMANCE
2.01        Early Stage
The Government of Lesotho greatly enhanced the start-up of the project by
carrying out investigations on the structural conditions and performance of most
of the paved roads in the lowlands - a greater part of which would form the
project roads. This was made easier by the provision of a PPF advance before the
actual start-up date of the project.   Hence, the project cycle was greatly
reduced.
2.02        Supervision Performance
RB''s performance during the supervision stage was made easier by timely and
well interspersed supervision missions.  Although the actual supervision was
mostly carried out by expatriate personnel - provided under IDA's technical aid -
a lot of local Basotho engineers were trained. Unfortunately, a large number of
them left RB to join the more attractive private sector.
2.03        Main Lessons of Experience
The project had two main objectives:
(a)   to lower transport costs and increase accessibility of rural areas;
and
(b)   to assist the Government in its institution-building efforts in the
transport sector while maximizing employment generation.
2.04        The first objective was successfully achieved.  The economic impact
assessment as shown by Table 6 in Part III and the latest traffic statistics on
the project roads bear testimony to this fact.
2.05        The second objective was only partially realized.  The institution-
building effort of Government in the transport sector envisaged under the project
did not materialize. During the life of the Fourth Highway Project, the Lesotho
Highlands Water Project (LHWP) which is being run along the lines of a private
concern came into being.  This project had lucrative attractions to graduate
engineers, most of which were trained under the Fourth Highway Project. This
resulted in the wholescale movement of most of RB's local Basotho engineers, (who
were in great demand) to join LHWP.
2.06        PVPS, however, was quite successful in this regard. Before the start
of this project PVPS had hardly any Basotho engineers. At the conclusion of the
project, PVPS was fully manned by Basotho engineers and technicians.
2.07        A measure of employment generation was achieved under the project.
The project helped to cement the Labour Construction Unit (LCU) firmly on its



- 12 -
feet by giving it a sustainable programme and a financial base to employ more
labourers. The LCU is now a full-fledged branch of MOW and no longer under the
auspices of RB.
2.08        On the basis of the foregoing points, the main lessons of experience
on this project can be summarized as followss
(i)   The disparity between the private sector and the Government on the
factor of remuneration for engineers and technicians if ignored will
incessantly plague any Government effort to strengthen its engineering
workforce.
(ii) The contribution of the private sector in the transport industry be
it in construction or maintenance cannot be overemphasized. Under this
project, it was discovered that it was more efficient to run privately
engaged plant and equipment than it was to run the Government fleet.
Under the Domestic Construction Industry Study, it was recommended that
the privatization of a larger part of the maintenance effort in the road
sector be undertaken. Government is preparing to undertake this effort.
(iii) The Fourth Highway Project was, to a large extent, coordinated by
expatriates due to the wholescale movement of local engineers to LHWP and
the private sector. The two expatriate personnel assigned to this project
for coordination had to be engaged up to the completion date of the
project in August 1992. As a result the few local engineers that remained
behind did not get as much exposure as these expatriates due to some work
exigencies in some other projects and activities of RB. Perhaps the GOL
would be well advised to try to address the problem of the unabating
movement of Basotho engineers from the civil service.
3.          PERFORMANCE OF THE SUPERVISION CONSULTANT
3.01        The performance of the consultant engaged from the feasibility study
stage up to the post-construction stage, was less than satisfactory. A number
of discrepancies were observed and put forward to the consultant to address, but
to date the consultant has not responded to these queries.
3.02        As a direct consequence of the consultant's performance in the
Engineering Report, contract documents and in the actual supervision process the
contract price was substantially increased.
4.          EFFECTIVENESS OF RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND IDA
4.01        The relationship between the Goverrment and IDA has been very
amiable, as indicated earlier. This warm relat.onship, especially with staff
assigned to supervise this project facilitated its successful completion.



- 13 -
5.          PERFORMANCE OF CO-FINANCIER
5.01        The co-financier for this project was the African Development Bank.
The African Development Fund (ADF) component of the project consisted of the
rehabilitation of the Maseru to Leribe road (88 km) and consultancy services for
its supervision, as well as that for the Maseru to Masianokeng road (under IDA
funding).
5.02        The performance of the ADB on this component was very good and the
relationship between GOL and ADB remained cordial over the course of implementa-
tion.
