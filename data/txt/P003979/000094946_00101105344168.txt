Project Development Objectives (DO) were downgraded in mid-1998 becausePLN was not in compliance
with the Rate of Return and other financial covenants on account of the macroeconomic crisis and inability
to raise the retail tariffs to adequate level. PLN became technically insolvent on account of the crisis. All
Indonesia power projects DO were rated Unsatisfactory in June 1998 for this reason.



3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The objectives of the Second Rural Electrification (RE II) Project as noted in the Staff Appraisal Report of
February 3, 1995 were to advance the efforts begun under the RE I project to place the rural electrification
program in Indonesia on an efficient and sustainable footing and expand the coverage and supply of
electricity to rural areas through a time slice investment program. The project would establish incentives
for private sector and local cooperatives to take an increasingly larger share of REl distribution and
renewable energy development wiithin the framework of a least cost RE Master Plan and continue PLN's
institutional development to undertake RE planning and implementation, especially at the regional level. It
would support pilot programs with potential for further reducing the costs of RE.
The objectives were clear and consistent with the Government of Indonesia (GOI) stated objective to
improve the welfare of the population and to support and stimulate economic activities and social
development in both rural and urban areas. RE is a fundamental part of the Government's rural
development strategy and the long-term goal is to electrify all villages and enable the basic services
provided by energy. The scale of the Project was realistic given the progress PLN had achieved in the
previous years, particularly the achievements in the RE I Project (Loan 31 80-IND).
3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives were not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
1. Electrification of 7,000 villages in the second and third years of Repelita VI (95/96-96/97) comprising
about 2.1 million new consumers.
2. Promote private sector participation in small scale generation especially using renewable energy
sources.
3. Development by PLN of 7.5 MW mini-hydro projects and field test drilling of two mini-geothermal
fields.
4. Pilots to test the adaptability of low cost, "low tech" equipment designs, low Cost network designs and
more efficient construction management methods for full scale adoption in future RE programs.
5. Expansion of the ongoing rural business services component to promote productive uses of electricity
and get 30,000 rural enterprises to start or enhance their productive use of electricity by 36 GWh/year.
6. Support participation by village-level cooperatives and organizations in RE services delivery. Double
the number of Pola I, II and MSA schemes to 4400 and increase five fold the number of MSA schemes
to 600.
7. Technical assistance for planning and RE implementation support.
3.4 Revised Components:
The components were not revised.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality of entry was not assessed by QAG. At appraisal no significant technical or implementation risks
were foreseen with respect to the RE planning, management and implementation and other investments
except the geothermal field development risks. This was substantially borne out daring implementation.
Risks of private sector participation in small power production and sale to PLN were expected to be
minimal due to issuance of standard power purchase agreement and published tariff. The private sector
response was positive but it took longer than anticipated for PLN to operationalize the approach. Risks
associated with implementing the overall policy reform agenda (institutional restru[cturing and tariff policy
reform) were under estimated. Work towards attaining these objectives continues today with support from
- 2 -



the Bank, ADB and other sources. The financial crisis that hit Indonesia in 1997 which was beyond GOI
and PLN's control could not be foreseen at project appraisal. While the crisis did not affect PLN's ability
to achieve the physical targets, it caused substantial deterioration in PLN's financial performance.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Over the five year period, 1994/95 to 1999/00, good progress was made in meeting the overall objective of
placing the rural electrification program on an efficient and sustainable footing. The Project exceeded its
physical objectives and is economically viable. To improve the benefits and reduce costs, PLN emphasized
consumer connections rather than village electrification by intensifying connections in already electrified
villages and by increasing connection ratios in newly electrified villages(villages electrified was 80 percent
greater and connections made were 270 percent more than estimated) The higher achievements are
consistent with the Repelita VI targets and were feasible because the Project period of performance was
extended to nearly five years from the original three. Household electrification ratio increased from 32
percent in 1994 to 53 percent by October 1999. To further improve the economic value of RE, the Project
successfully promoted productive uses of electricity by rural businesses.
Unit costs were significantly below estimates at appraisal (see Annex 1). Cost reductions are mainly
attributed to lower cost of materials, higher density of connections per km of MV and LV line, and lower
international inflation and higher Rupiah depreciation than projected in price contingencies. The project
successfully piloted a number of lower cost RE technologies and management methods as well as
mini-hydro as an alternative to diesels.
The Pola program targets were met albeit two years later than anticipated,in PLN's efforts to decentralize
some RE service functions to cooperatives to reduce costs However, Village Cooperative Unit (KUD)
training was not fully successful due to: (a) shortage of training funds from PLN which had anticipated
providing funds out of its profits, and from GOI which had agreed at negotiations to make up any shortfall;
(b) PLN fee structure for KUD services were considered too low to permit the KUDs to fund the training
out of its own resources; and (c) lack of a clear policy mandate within PLN for outsourcing services to
KUDs.
Private participation in small power generation was supported by the issuance of regulations and letters of
awards, announcement of purchase tariffs, but the financial crisis in 1997 prevented further progress.
The project substantially strengthened PLN's RE management capacities. Of particular note was the
effectiveness of the Project Management Unit which was specifically set up to coordinate project
implementation. The PMU greatly facilitated Bank supervision as well as provided timely information to
PLN management.
While the Project addressed the issues of financial sustainability through cost reductions from improved
management practices and adoption of lower cost technical solutions, it did not have actions to explicitly
strengthen PLN's overall financial capacity, other than financial covenants addressing such considerations.
PLN's financial position weakened dramatically during the tenure of the Project. Since 1994, prior to the
onset of the crisis, PLN was moderately profitable but nonetheless was unable to achieve the target ROR
level of 8 percent. PLN was able to comply with the debt service coverage covenant of 1.5 times until the
1997 financial crisis. The financial problem is especially acute outside Java. While PLN RE operations in
Java had operating profits (Rp 557 billion in 1999), outside Java RE operations were loss making (Rp. 657
billion operating loss in 1999). For details see Section E in Annex 3. Based on GOI's agreement with the
IMF on rationalization of energy prices in January 2000, PLN's average tariff was increased by about 29%
effective April 1, 2000. The GOI issued a Power Sector Restructuring Policy in August 1998 for which the
Ministry of Mines and Energy is drafting the supporting legislation. The policy addresses a number of
- 3 -



financial sustainability issues affecting RE.
4.2 Outputs bv components:
1. Distribution component. PLN substantially exceeded the targets by electrifying 12,300 villages (7,900
outside Java and 4,400 in Java) and connecting about 7.7 million consumers (2.8 million outside Java
and 4.9 million in Java) up to October 1999. Annual average connection rate was 1.8 million per year
over the five year time slice in Repelita VI. At appraisal, PLN expected to connect 2.1 million
consumers in 7,000 villages during a two-year period.
2. Private sector participation in small scale generation. By January 1996 the 'GOI had issued the small
power purchase (PSKSK) regulations,announced the purchase tariffs and established the MW limits of
PLN's obligation to purchase. By March 1997 PLN had issued Letters of Award for power purchases
for nearly 220 MW from renewable energy sources. The Bank approved the Renewable Energy Small
Power Project (RESP) Project in 1997 to finance such projects, but the financial crisis prevented
further progress and the RESP Project was subsequently canceled.
3. Mini-hydro and mini-geothermal component. The mini-hydro projects (7.8 MW) were commissioned
at about 14 percent under estimated cost. After geo-scientific studies PLN decided to proceed with
drilling at the Ambon (Malukku) site but was later abandoned as acceptable biLds were not received.
PLN also prepared mini-hydro and mini-geothermal projects with an aggregate capacity of about 30
MW for assistance under a future project, but the financial crisis prevented further action.
4. Pilot projects. Tap substation, reinforced concrete pole, contract administration contract pilots were
successful. The wood pole tending were successfully completed, but implementation could not take
place due to contracting delays. PLN has begun incorporating these approaches into PLN guidelines
but formal issuance of standards has yet to occur. SWER project was stopped during the crisis.
5. Rural business services component. PLN successfully engaged rural NGOs to promote productive
electricity uses resulting in 66,000 enterprises investing Rp. 148 billion in electric equipment, and
creating 22,000 new jobs and increasing consumption by 180 GWh per year. ][mportantly, this
development took place even during the national financial crisis.
6. Participation by cooperatives in RE services delivery KUD participation in RE service delivery
increased as planned. The total number of Pola I, II and MSA schemes doubled to 4,516 compared to
4,400 expected at appraisal to serve 20.8 million customers. The number of MSA schemes increased
seven-fold to 665 compared to 600 expected at appraisal. The secondary objective of setting up Pola
III schemes could not be met. The training planned under this component was :not as successful as
expected due to the reasons mentioned in Section 4.1.
7. Other Technical assistance. The RE planning capability was developed for four regions extending the
work in the RE I Project. Renewable Energy Master Plan software and databases were developed and
transferred. However their routine use in RE planning has yet to take place. T'he PMU functioned as a
very effective management unit.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
For the distribution component, the EIRR was estimated at 26.2% and the NPV at 12% discount rate at
2,079 BRp (1995 Rp). The analysis is sensitive to the estimate of residential willingness to pay, which is
in tum sensitive to the consumer surplus. There is also a high degree of uncertainty in the consumer surplus
estimate as it had to be estimated from secondary data sources (for details see Section 8 lessons learned and
Annex 3 Economic Costs and Benefits). The switching value for consumer surplus at which the EIRR
drops to 12% is estimated to be -12%. Almost all the other components also met or exceeded the economic
performance indicators estimated at appraisal. Summary results are shown in the table below with details
given in Annex 3.

4.4 Financial rate of return:
Financial rate of return for the RE II Project was neither calculated at project appraisal nor at project
completion.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
A key innovation introduced in the project was the establishment of the PMU, initially under the Director of
Planning and subsequently under the Director of Marketing and Distribution. This unit effectively
coordinated this complex project which involved a multiplicity of components scattered throughout
Indonesia and requiring cooperation among numerous PLN departments at headquarters and regions,
consultants, contractors and the Bank. The PMU was particularly effective in monitoring and reporting
progress and advising PLN Directors on problem resolution. However, given the vertically organized
departmental structure within PLN, the PMU had little capacity to directly effect change by cutting across
the departmental hierarchy. The PMU's effectiveness as a management unit was also constrained bythe
lack of reliable inventory and performance data. The use of a supervision consultant to oversee the
implementation of the mini-hydro and pilot projects was effective given the multiplicity of PLN offices
involved but reflects the need for institutional streamlining. The use of trained local NGOs in promoting
productive uses of electricity was particularly effective and the capacity built will permit these groups to
continue to provide such services.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The economic crisis in Indonesia led to: (a) the sharp depreciation of the Rupiah and greatly increased the
cost to PLN of its US$-denominated long-term payment obligations; and (b) PLN's planned addition of
about 11,000 MW by 26 projects of IPP-based capacity has resulted in excess capacity given the economic
downturn. The net result is that PLN is currently unable to service fully its debt or to meet its payment
obligations to IPPs.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Sector reform has proceeded at a much slower pace than anticipated. Technical assistance undertaken in
1996 under Cirata II project (Ln 3602-IND) provided a set of recommendations which served as a
- 5-



blueprint for power sector reform and restructuring. The recommendations provided the underpinnings for
the Government's Power Sector Restructuring Policy which was launched in August 1998. The Policy calls
for far reaching changes in the power sector, including the unbundling of PLN and subsequent privatization
in phases. It is expected that the policy framework will be instrumental in providing a sound foundation of
PLN's and the sector's medium and longer-term viability, including establishment of a Social Electricity
Development Fund to explicitly fund the GOI's obligation to provide electricity services to rural consumers.
The Ministry of Mines and Energy is presently drafting legislation to support this policy. To promote the
gains so far achieved, the Bank is providing technical assistance (under Loan 3978-IND) for corporate and
financial restructuring of PLN. The Financial Advisor which was funded under this project, also provided
timely input to PLN in this critical time.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Appointment of competent, properly motivated staff at the PMU was a key to the success achieved in
project management. PLN has strong technical capacities down to the regional and branch levels which
enabled it to embark on the ambitious RE program. Nevertheless, there are managerial, organizational and
implementation improvements possible to lower cost and speed execution. Further cost reductions and
efficiency improvements require PLN to adopt the low-cost technical solutions piloted in this project,
establish tighter inventory controls and audit procedures, increase procurement efficiency, and most
importantly give regional and branch-level managers the right incentives to minimize costs and increase
revenues (see Section 8 and Annex 9). MOCSE performance was constrained by inadequate training fimds
from PLN and GOI sources and clear PLN directives for outsourcing RE services.
5.4 Costs and financing:
Estimated total project cost at appraisal was $841 million while the actual projeclt cost was $656 million
(based on PLN and Bank disbursement records of August 1, 2000). Total savings of $185 million (22%)
occurred while PLN connected 7.7 million consumers between July 1995 and October 1999 compared to
the appraisal target of 2.1 million consumers in two years. Reasons for the cost savings include: Rupiah
depreciation far greater than estimated in price contingencies at appraisal caused the dollar costs to decline;
lower cost of materials; and greater emphasis on intensification rather than extensification (300 connections
per km of MV and LV line compared to 100 connections estimated at appraisa).
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Sustainability of RE II Project achievements is likely because of the inherent techmical and institutional
capability of PLN which were further strengthened during the Project; and through the implementation of
the GOI's announced Power Sector Restructuring Policy The policy proposed (a) setting up a Social
Electricity Development Fund (SEDF) to transparently subsidize rural and less developed area electricity
operations to "promote national cohesion and unity,"by providing explicit funding by the GOI of the
incremental costs of RE as part of its social obligation. The SEDF will subsidize the difference between
allowable costs and revenue receipts from electricity sales to the poor in less developed and rural areas(b)
increasing average tariffs over time to permit full cost recovery, especially on Java(c) restructuring PLN
to establish a regional electricity company to own outside Java assets and be fully accountable for its
operation; and (d) to functionally unbundle Java operations. The legislation to support the policy is
presently being drafted. The Bank and ADB are financing technical assistance to support policy
implementation.
PLN's technical and institutional capacities remain intact today despite the financial crisis. Care should be
taken during the proposed restructuring of PLN to ensure that these capacities are strengthened and not
diminished. PLN has begun adopting the low cost designs and improved construction management methods
- 6 -



piloted in the Project which will further reduce costs.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
On a technical level, PLN's current organization is fully capable of operating and maintaining the RE
investments and providing new service connections.RE will continue to be a priority as a majority of
Indonesians yet live in rural areas and 20 million rural households are still without access to electricity. It
is recommended that the PMU be established as a permanent feature for RE project management and such
functional units be mainstreamed to the regions during PLN restructuring.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
Identification of project components and techno-economic and environmental assessments were
satisfactorily conducted in a participatory manner. Project objectives continue to be consistent with Bank
and GOI development objectives. Preparation and appraisal were satisfactory and complete. The
management structure established was a key contributor to the Project's successful completion.
7.2 Supervision:
Supervision is rated highly satisfactory with typically two to three missions per year. The team that
prepared the project essentially remained the same throughout the implementation period except for one
team member substituting for another as task team leader in 1999. This team continuity permitted better
understanding, greater confidence and cooperation with PLN.The IP (Implementation Progress) was either
rated "Highly Satisfactory" or "Satisfactory", while the DO (Development Objective) rating was
downgraded to "Unsatisfactory" in June 1998 due to the financial crisis that began in 1997, and was kept
so till loan closing.
The Bank took proactive actions on loan proceeds cancellations once loan savings were identified; the Bank
also responded quickly to PLN's deteriorated financial situation by restructuring the Project and amending
the Loan Agreement to allow increase of the Bank loan disbursement percentage for local expenditure
(excluding payment of taxes) to 100% from July 1998 onwards, which relieved considerably the pressure
on PLN to pay the contractors.
7.3 Overall Bankperfonnance:
Bank performance is rated satisfactory overall.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
GOI and PLN's performance is deemed satisfactory. They were involved in all aspects of the project
concept and design.
7.5 Government imiplementation performance:
The Govemment's performance during implementation was marginally satisfactory. Counterpart funds
were made available in a timely manner except close to project completion when the financial crisis was in
full swing and PLN's financial performance was deteriorating drastically. In August 1998,GOI officially
issued the Power Sector Restructuring Policy, which provided the framework for restructuring the power
sector, including PLN. The Ministry of Mines and Energy is presently drafting legislation needed to
implement the policy. Delays in instituting agreed-to tariff reforms have substantially eroded PLN's
finances. GOI also has not been proactive in addressing the issues of under-capitalization of PLN.
- 7 -



Govemment rules goveming procurement led to delays in contracting which was a further drain on PLN's
resources (see below).
7.6 Implementing Agency:
PLN's overall performance is generally satisfactory, with RE program management and physical
implementation capacity rated highly satisfactory. Areas where improvements are essential are in
procurement and contracting, inventory management and technical auditing. Because of procurement
delays, PLN had to draw substantially on their own funds to permit it to meet its Repelita VI targets
particularly in the first the two years of the Project (e.g., two thirds of 1995/96 and 1996/97 RE investment
funds were from PLN's own resources). This further exacerbated PLN's already strained financial
situation. There is also a need to have better inventory information and controlPl,N was also never able to
satisfactorily conduct technical audits of physical progress (see Section 8).
PLN's financial performance has not been satisfactory. It's financial position has deteriorated dramatically
during the tenure of the Project, though mainly due to factors (including the financial crisis, high cost of
IPPs, and GOI's unwillingness to approve required tariff increase) beyond its control. As a result, PLN
was unable at any time during the Project period to fully comply with the financial covenants established
for it under the Project.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall Borrower performance can be considered marginally satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
Rural electrification programs must be financially sustainable and the implementing organization
must be financially accountable. The Government continues its policy of uniforn national tariffs which
resulted in revenue losses to PLN for its higher cost rural operations outside Java. PLN maintains separate
operating cost accounts for its RE operations. Data from 1995 onwards show that Java RE operations
consistently had operating profits while outside Java operations had operating los,sesRevenues from
outside Java operations did not even cover variable operating costs. These losses were covered by cross
subsidies from Java operations and from Government funds.The Bank's appraisa]. of the RE II project did
not evaluate the financial viability of the RE program, rather, only the financial viability of PLN as a whole
was considered. As such, inadequate attention was paid to the financial viability of RE, especially outside
Java operations. Moreover, the lack of transparency in allocating government budgets and use of PLN
resources for RE makes it difficult to assess performance and assign accountability.
Holding management accountable for financial performance down to region and branch levels is
required to increase cost efficiency of RE services. Presently PLN allocates annual budgets to regional
(Wilayah) offices with unspent funds used to reduce following year's allocation. The regional and branch
(Cabang) offices are set village and household electrification targets, and loss recduction goalsThere is
little incentive for regional and branch level managers to increaserevenues or reduce costs Holding
management accountable for meeting cost reduction and revenue enhancement goals is essential.
Productive uses promotion was effective in increasing economic benefits and revenues. The Project
demonstrated that local NGOs could be effectively used to advise rural businesses to increase productive
electricity use. The rural business service (RBS) component clearly demonstrated that a marketing oriented
approach can increase energy sales, investment and rural employment for productive purposes, even during
the crisis period after 1997. The approach used could be considered good practice (see Annex 7, Reference
8). Similar approaches should be included in future rural electrification projects.
- 8 -



Electricity consumption by key consuming categories must be included as Key Performance
Indicators as this is a better indicator of benefits from a project, rather than just the number of
connections made. As noted in OED's 1994 review of rural electrification in Asia, accurate determination
of the benefits and costs of RE is needed to ensure that resources are optimally allocatedConsumption
data is routinely collected by utility billing departments, but their managementinformation system must be
designed to report on consumption by consumers connected during a specified time-slice investment
program. In addition, consumer surveys must be conducted prior to and after connections to determine how
energy use and expenditure patterns changed after receiving electricity services.
Centralized project management was effective in monitoring progress but less effective in directing
change. The PMU demonstrated the importance of having a centralized unit for managing this complex
project involving multiplicity of components scattered throughout the Indonesian archipelago, and requiring
coordination between numerous PLN departments, consultants, contractors and the Bank. The PM-L
enhanced the effectiveness of Bank supervision. The PMU ability to take timely corrective actions was
limited by the vertically organized directorate structure at PLN which required instructions from the PMU
to a division in another directorate to be coursed through their respective directors. Future
multi-disciplinary projects can benefit from such a management unit if it is led by experienced managers
and has the necessary authority to affect change in a matrix management structure.
Complex procurement procedures cause implementation delays and inefficiencies. PLN acknowledged
that their current procurement processes are lengthy and inefficient, partly due to GOI-mandated
requirements. The CAC pilot demonstrated that significant cost and time saving are possible using
performance-based contracting approaches.
Management commitment supported by timely, accurate and accessible information is essential for
effective management and increasing the efficiency of rural electrification. Current approaches in
accounting, inventory management, technical audits, demand/benefits assessments and timely dissemination
and adoption of best practices can be improved.
*   Transparency of accounts: In a time-slice investment program of this type, the current accounting
practices made it nearly impossible to determine the sources and uses of financing for a particular RE
scheme - a specific RE scheme may use material financed by several sources, the Bank, GOI, PLN or
even other donor funds. Therefore, the actual costs are hard to determine due to the co-mingling of
resources.
•   Inventorvy Effective inventory information and control are needed. This is essential in a project such as
the RE II Project where huge quantities of materials are procured, delivered and installed throughout
the vast regions of Indonesia. PLN must have better ability to track costs, material distribution and
usage, and inventory levels in each region in a timely manner.
*   Audits: Independent technical audits - a Project monitoring requirement - while valid in concept failed
in implementation. These audits were expected to check compliance with construction standards,
authenticate inventory reporting, confirm customer service standards, verify equipment performance,
and accuracy and adequacy of reports on materials used. Strong management support and conviction
is needed for such independent audits to be conducted effectively. Without such audits, the
effectiveness of RE programs cannot be evaluated adequately.
*   Best Practices: The Project implemented pilot projects and mini-hydro projects with lower costs than
conventional alternatives, and developed new RE planning tools. PLN is compiling standards and
issuing guidelines for their use. benefits from these experiences will occur only if PLN adopts these
standards ("SPLN") and procedures and requires their use.

9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
The following are synopses. The full reports are in the Project Files.
9.1    PLN Assessment of the Project
9.1.1 General. PLN is a very large organization responsible for generation, transmission and
distribution for both urban and rural area throughout the country. In the past PLN emphasized
generation, transmission, urban distribution and village electrification (in contrast to consumer
connection). However the RE II project has helped PLN develop the know-how and capacity to carry
out rural electrification in a more efficient manner. PLN is now in a good position to proceed with
future rural electrification projects and ensure that it is undertaken economically and in accordance with
PLN and GOI objectives.
PLN was able to achieve these impressive goals of electrifying 7.7 million households in five years with
an effective management team - The PMU. The PMU became the focal point for directing the program
from its conception to final implementation. Bank has been an essential and effeclive partner to PLN
during the design and implementation of the project. It supported PLN both financially and in guiding
implementation. PLN Implementation Completion Report is in the Project files.
9.1.2 Key Lessons. Based on the experience carried over from the RE I Project and the lessons learned
during the RE II Project, PLN acknowledges that four major points need to be considered in future RE
efforts.
(i)    Improve procurement processes. During project implementation, PLN endeavored to reduce
the procurement processing delays. However, existing institutionalized processes at PLN and at the
Bank sometimes took almost twice as long as the period of performance (e.g., delays of up to 20 months
from tendering to contract award for components with a one-year delivery time). This caused problems
with the construction phase, and to overcome this, PLN drew on its own funds to purchase the
necessary materials to keep up progress of work. Shorter procurement time is possible as demonstrated
by the TAP Substations pilot project, when only 10 months was needed from tendering to contract
signing. However, some of the delays are due to GOI procedural requirements.
(ii)    Encourage adoption of least cost solutions for materials and construction. The pilot projects
were designed to demonstrate least cost solutions in RE. PLN found that a lack oif awareness as to the
foreseen benefits by PLN staff hindered progress. Even though results were positive, PLN still foresees
a difficult task to get these approaches mainstreamed regionally.
(iii)   Planning and management software must be transparent and accessible to headquarters and
field staff. PLN found that lack of skilled staff in the Regions as well as Head Office constrained the
adoption of Renewable Energy Master Planning and RE Planning software developed by consultants.
Moreover, PLN staff did not fully perceive the benefits of such software. An important lesson is that
PLN staff must be more involved in all phases of software development.
(iv)   Establish a permanent Project Management Unit for Rural Electrification. PLN
acknowledges the positive impact of the PMU approach for any multi-disciplinary program and
congratulates itself on the success of this approach. This in-house team enabled a more efficient
approach to project management in all phases of the RE program.
9.1.3  Effectiveness of the Bank and Borrower Relationship. The relationship between the Bank
and PLN was generally good. Most of the problems encountered were clearly identified by both parties,
solutions were promptly agreed to and provided to those concemed. In particular, mutual understanding
was achieved in selecting least cost materials and processes, developing monitoring and tracking
processes and overcoming procedural problems likely to cause potential delays.
- 10-



9.1.4  Performance of Co-financiers and Effectiveness of Relationship between Borrower and
Cofinanciers. None.
9.1.5   Assessment of Outcome. As a continuation of the RE I program, the main objectives of the
project were not only to electrify villages and connect rural households but also to build PLN capacity
to efficiently and sustainably carry out rural electrification program. It also included a number of other
components as detailed in Section 3.3 of the ICR. PLN confirms that the outcome isin globo positive.
9.2    Evaluation of PLN's Performance by PLN
PLN staff gained significant experience from the project. PLN's capacity to carry out rural
electrification program efficiently has improved. Positive features must be mainstreamed within PLN.
To maintain PLN's financial health, its important for PLN to minimize construction and service cost
and at the same time maximize revenue through tariff revenues and through Government assistance.
PLN must also develop systems criteria to prioritize selection of villages for electrification. Systems
developed within the RE II Project to monitor and track progress should be mainstreamed to the regions,
especially if PLN is restructured.
9.3    Evaluation of Bank Performance by PLN
The RE II Project effectively built upon the Bank and PLN's prior relationship and experience during
RE I Project (Loan 31 80-IND). Implementation assistance by the Bank was generally satisfactory. The
efforts were very constructive in every aspect from project identification through implementation. The
Bank's involvement was consistent and diligent through all phases. During the identification phase, the
Bank sent qualified and competent missions so that the process in establishing the project objective, and
assessment of the project cost, scope of work, financing plan and time schedule was accomplished
successfully in a relatively short time. During appraisal, the Bank was fully involved in the assessment
of cost, planning the scope of work, source of finance, time schedule, and delivered constructive
suggestions during cost revision and scope of work negotiations. During construction phase, Bank
consistently assisted PLN in supervision of procurement, and implementation of the components.
9.4 MOCSE Assessment of the Project
MOCSE notes that Pola training targets could not be achieved due to sharp decrease in PUKK funds from
PLN and the Government's inability to provide additional funding as originally planned. However, the Pola
training program need not be overly dependent on formal classroom training provided by PLN training
center - direct on-the-job training provides an acceptable alternative. A clear policy and mission statement
for rural electrification is needed if the Pola Program and its training is to be effective.

Annex 3: Economic Costs and Benefits
A. Economic Analysis of Distribution Component
The economic analysis of the distribution component involves a cost benefit analysis of electricity sold to
residential and non-residential consumers that were connected under the project. The analysis was done in
constant 1995 Rp to facilitate comparison with the original SAR. Input data from PLN and other sources,
as well as key estimates and assumptions are contained in tables at the end of this section of the Annex.
Connections and Consumption by Residential and Non-residential Consumers Under the Project
Data on total annual connections per year under the project was supplied by PLN for 1995-1999, along
with forecasts of intensification connections to be made in villages electrified under the Project. Based on
estimates supplied by PLN for all rural customers in 1998 and 1999, these connections were split between
residential and non-residential customers. Average annual residential and non-residential consumption per
consumer was obtained from PLN records for rural Java and outside Java for 1998 and 1999. In 1995,
average consumption per new customer per year was estimated at 540 kWh/year per residential customer in
Java, 430 kWh/year per residential customer off Java and 5,000 and 3,184 kWh per year for
non-residential customers on Java and outside Java, respectively [1] Growth in average consumption of
newly connected customers, based on PLN sales data by consumer category, was estimated at 2% per year
for residential consumers and 7.8% per year for non-residential consumers.
Estimation of Benefits
Willingness to Pay ofResidential Consumers. Benefits for electricity are based on the willingness to pay
for electricity used for lighting and other purposes. The willingness to pay for electricity used for lighting is
estimated as the tariff paid plus the calculated consumer surplus obtained from the substitution of kerosene
lamps by electric lights. The methodology used to estimate consumer surplus compares the price and
quantity of light obtained from kerosene lamps and electric lights, on a per lumen basiq'2]. In the absence
of recent survey data, it is assumed that half of all electricity used is for lighting, the other half for other
purposes [3]. Willingness to pay for electricity used for other purposes is estimated as only the tariff paid,
in the absence of survey evidence on uses and willingness to pay for altemative energy sources for those
uses. The analysis probably underestimates the willingness to pay for services other than lighting. In the
future, conmected consumers should be surveyed to better determine the uses and value of electricity to the
user. Prices used in this analysis are based on 1995 price levels, which are considered to be more
representative of realistic prices for kerosene and electricity than post-1997 financial crisis price levelf4].
Using 1995 price levels and the methodology for calculating consumer surplus developed for the
Bangladesh Third RE Project ICR, results in an estimated consumer surplus for lighting of 1,153 Rp/kWh
for both Java and outside Java[51. The willingness to pay for all uses is then calculated to be 709 and 715
Rp/kWh for residential consumers in Java and outside Java, respectively[6j.
Willingness to Pay of Non-residential Customers. Benefits for non-residential customers were based on
willingness to pay, estimated as the costs of self generation using a captive diesel. These costs were
estimated in 1995 prices as 400 and 440 Rp/kWh in Java and outside Java respectively.
Project Costs
The project investment costs were adjusted to 1995 prices and taxes were excluded. Investment costs
included the MV and LV distribution network and house connections, including house wiring. Energy
supply costs were based on LRMC for residential customers at LV and commercial customers at MV,
estimated in a 1998 study prepared by Hagler & Bailly for PLN. LRMC were corrected to 1995 prices,
and the costs for residential customers were corrected to MV, since distribution investments were included
in the project costs.

Results of the Economic Analysis
The results of the economic analysis for the base case and switching value analyses are shown in Table I.
The detailed cash flow is given in Table II. The EIRR was estimated at 26.2% and the NPV at 12%
discount rate at 2,079 BRp. This is slightly higher than the original estimate in die SAR of 21. 1%. The
analysis is very sensitive to the estimate of residential willingness to pay, which is in turn sensitive to the
consumer surplus. The switching value of the consumer surplus at which EIRR drops to 12%, was
estimated to be -12%. The analysis is robust with respect to electricity consumption levels as the switching
value is -72%.

Endnotes
1. The kWh consumption for a newly connected consumer was taken as 90 percent of average estimated 1995
consumption per residential consumer. PLN data of average 1999 sales to rural residential and
non-residential customers on and outside Java was deflated back to 1995 levels using consumption growth
rates experienced by PLN.
2. Using the model developed by D. Barnes (SASEG) to compute consumer surplus for the Bangladesh Third
Rural Electrification Project ICR (Report No. 21290).
3. From Indonesia Rural Electrification Review (1986), the last data available on consumption patterns.
4. Kerosene price has not changed since 1995, while the electricity tariff increased only 20% in current terms (by
end of Project). Since the financial crisis resulted in inflation that increased the CPI by 226% over the period,
the real kerosene price declined by 56% while the real electricitv price declined by 46%.
5. There is no difference between Java and outside Java because the kerosene price are the same, and the results
are insensitive to variations in quantities consumed.
6. This is calculated as [(tariff+consumer surplus)*(percent kerosene used for lighting)-Ftariff*(percent kerosene
used for other purposes)]. The methodology used is veiy sensitive to two key assumptions:
*   The demand curve is a straight line. While the use of a straight line demand curve is standard practice
when calculating consumer surplus in the Bank, there is little empirical evidence to support this
assumption. If the demand curve were to be concave rather than a straight line, the consumer surplus
would be less. Assuming a concave shape (slope of 0.3) rather than a straight line (slope of 0.5) would
reduce the estimated consumer surplus to 691 RpIkWh.
*   The share ofpressurized lamps in the lighting mix is small. Because pressurized lamps are more
efficient, the consumer surplus from the switch from such lamps to electricity is much less than from wick
lamps or hurricane lamps. The shares assumed in this analysis are 10% pressurized lamps, 40%
hurricane lamps, and 50% wick lamps based on PLN estimates. If the share of piessurized lamps were to
increase, the consumer surplus would drop.

B. Economic Analysis of Mini-hydro Component
The economic analysis for the mini-hydro component is given below:

The mini hydro projects, except for Ulung Peliang are lower in economic cost, i.e. the least cost
solution compared to diesel alternative. The EIRR is also greater than Io% for all sites except for
Ulung Peliang even if useful energy output dropped to 80% of base case assumptions (Table 3).

80% of Base
The poor performance of Ulung Peliang is a result of a poor analysis of the site hydrology during
the feasibility study. The design consultants overestimated the size of the catchment (30 km2 versus
9 km2 actual due to erroneous maps and over-estimated mean annual flows. In order to avoid
similar problems in future projects it is essential to have critical project design work such as
hydrological analysis reviewed and vetted by qualified consultants.
Details of cost calculations and assumptions are given in: Worley Intemational, "RE II Mini
Hydropower Project Completion Report," June 2000 in the Project Files. Further details with respect to
the Ulung Peliang issues are found in: Winrock International, "Post Commissioning Inspection Report
of the RE II Mini-hydro Projects," prepared for World Bank, April 2000.

Contract Administration Companies  30% in overall line and distribution construction costs
Single Wire Earth Return           Pilot could not be completed due to financial crisis
HV Tapped Substations              50-60% compared to conventional substations
Reinforced Concrete Poles          30% compared to spun concrete poles
Wood Poles (based on tender prices)    60-80% compared to spun concrete poles
Details are found in the various pilot project final reports in Project Files.
D. Rural Business Services Component
The RBS program demonstrated that PLN can increase productive uses of electricity by targeting
marketing interventions and price incentives which address information constrains and business
needs of small enterprises in rural areas. it also demonstrated that local NGOs can be viable rural
marketing partners for PLN. The RBS component enabled 63,000 new commercial enterprises to
become PLN customers receive electricity services and resulted 16,700 jobs being created. The
corresponding increase in electricity usage was 180 million kWh per year. For details: see: Worley
International, "Case Study Review of the Rural Business Services Program," prepared for PT PLN
(Persero), May 2000, in the Project Files.

Annex 9. Lessons Learned: Results from Stakeholders Meetings
With 47% of rural consumers yet unelectrified, attention should be given to enhancing PLN's RE
capability and increasing its effectiveness within a restructured and unbundled PLN. Therefore, it is
important to ascertain and record the lessons learned from the project to benefit future RE programs in
Indonesia (as well as similar programs in other countries). To assist in the process of gathering and
analyzing the lessons learned from the various stakeholders, the Bank ICR team led two half-day
brainstorming sessions attended by PLN, MOCSE and consultants. Representatives included PLN (Rural
Electrification, PMU, Supporting Services, Foreign Cooperation Administration, Construction Accounting,
Environment, Procurement. Construction Control, Supervision Unit, MOCSE, Central NGO for RBS, and
consultants).
The method used in eliciting and ranking responses was a modified form of the Objective Oriented Project
Planning (OOPP) approach. The OOPP methodology is described in detail in the UNIDO publications
"Quality Management of Development Cooperation, Part 2, The Method," UNIDO, Vienna 1997.
These sessions were well attended with a very high level of participation (-25 persons/day) and
contribution from all the attendees. Observations made by the participants summarized below and noted in
the subsequent tables. The scores assigned to each "Lesson" were based on the votes cast by the
participants - the higher the score, the greater the importance assigned to that observation. Due to time
constraints, mini-geothermal component, technical audits and small power purchase regulation adoption
were not discussed.
Management
-  The Project Management Unit demonstrated the importance of having an organizational
mechanism for managing this complex project involving multiplicity of components scattered
throughout the Indonesian archipelago, and requiring coordination between numerous PLN
departments, consultants, contractors and the Bank. The PMU ability and authority to cut across
the vertically organized directorate structures are critical.
Distribution Investment Component
- The PLN should not have to bear the public service obligation of rural electrification. The off-Java
RE operations requires GOI assistance for financial sustainability. The establishment of the Social
Electricity Development Fund as proposed in the August 1998 policy statement supports this
finding.
-  Existing GOI regulations and PLN procedures cause delays in tender preparation, bid evaluation
and contract award. Permitting just-in-time materials supply; timely issuance of NOLs by the
Bank; and use of perfonnance-based contracting can reduce time and costs.
-  The lack of adequate materials inventory information and controls and recording of physical
progress through field audits are a severe hindrance to effective management and cost controlAn
integrated Management Information System accessible by all PLN units is needed to provide wide
and timely access to information
-  Centralized planning, management and operations hinders responding effectively to customer needs
and local conditions - many such functions should be decentralized to regional offices.
Pilot Projects (CAC, Tap substations, RCP, Wood poles, SWER)
-  The CAC, Tap substations, RCP poles pilot projects in particular, have clearly demonstrated that
significant cost savings are possible even at pilot scale. Prospects exist for even more savings when
mainstreamed. PLN has begun drafting the standards and guidelines for mainstreaming but as yet
have not required their adoption.
-  Future pilot project identification and formulation should involve PLN regional staff to increase
buy-in and ownership.
- 35 -



Mini-hydro
- The mini-hydro projects have demonstrated their technical and economic viability. Further
significant cost and time-to-completion reductions are feasible. In particular, design simplification,
use of perfonmance-based tendering procedures and EPC contracting approaches can reduce cost
and time.
-  PLN does not have a comparative advantage in implementing these small power projects.
Therefore, PLN should encourage private sector or others to invest in such projects and sell power
to PLN. Similar small hydro projects by the private sector with Bank financing in India and Sri
Lanka cost less than half the cost of the projects by PLN. Complex organizational arrangements
and bureaucratic approaches at PLN increased coordination difficulties, costs and time to
completion.
- There is presently little encouragement to recognize the cost effectiveness and environmental
soundness of these projects as subsidized diesel fuel (USc 7.5/liter vs USc 18/liter at appraisal)
give no financial incentive to PLN to use anything other than diesels.
* Rural Business Services (RBS) Program
- The efforts of the local NGOs through the RBS program were effective in incr,easing productive
uses. A marketing oriented approach can increase kWh sales for productive purposes. The actual
marketing services could be also out-sourced to other agents or done in-house by PLN Productive
use promotion should target consumers both in rural or urban areas.
- The integration of RBS with related services, such as tariff classification and connection
commitments within and outside PLN, equipment supply and credit access, could contribute to
increased effectiveness.
-  The effectiveness of RBS can be improved if the PLN regional/branch management is convinced of
the value of increased kWh sales for productive uses. This requires appropriate tariff structures
and decentralized implementation.
* Pola Program
- Since GOI Law # 15 has been issued, Pola MSA approach is important for encouraging the
cooperatives, NGO's and private enterprises to develop their own generation.
-  PLN's out-sourcing of services such as billing, collection, line maintenance, bulk power purchase
and distribution to cooperatives can be effective as part of a least cost approach to rural
electrification services. However, the fee structure and other arrangements must be carefully
considered to make them viable for both PLN and the cooperatives. These services to PLN should
be open to a broad range of agents including private companies, community organizations and
NGOs, in addition to cooperatives.
- The effectiveness of efforts to out-source pola services depends in part on the commitment of PLN
to 'rightsizing'.
-  The lack of progress in implementing MSAs reflected a lack of policy-level and staff commitment
to handing over PLN sites, which may have been a reflection of fears about the effects on PLN
staffing levels.
Technical Assistance
-  In general, regional involvement is needed to enhance ownership and facilitate 'implementation.
-  RE planning tools should be tailored to the organization level at PLN responsible for specific
planning activities. e.g., bulk supply planning may be done at headquarters and regional levels
while distribution planning should be delegated to branches and sub-branches. PLN staff must be
involved in selecting and designing planning tools rather than having a consultant specify and
develop them independently.
- Accessible (e.g., web-based) planning tools and data should be used to increase access.
