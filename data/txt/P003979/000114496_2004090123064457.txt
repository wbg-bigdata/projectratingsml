                        Description of the Project
    The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower in
the implementation of its long-term power sector policy agenda
aimed, inter alia, at: (a) reducing the  unit cost burden of
rural electrification through least cost planning, lowering
equipment and construction costs, and by restructuring PLN's
organizational structure and management processes specific to
its rural electrification mission; (b) enhancing the efficiency
of rural electrification delivery by increasing and
strengthening local participation; (c) maximizing the economic
benefits of rural electrification by promoting productive uses
of electricity in rural areas; (d) expanding the coverage and
supply of electricity to rural areas through a time slice
investment program; (e) establishing incentives for private
sector and local cooperatives to take an increasingly larger
share of rural electrification distribution and alternative
energy development within the framework of a least cost rural
electrification master plan; (f) continuing PLN's institutional
development to undertake rural electrification planning and
implementation, especially at the regional level; and (g)
undertaking pilot distribution programs that have the potential
for further reducing the costs of rural electrification
extensification and intensification with a view to introducing
them as regular components in the government's rural
electrification program.
    The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such
modifications thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree
upon from time to time to achieve such objectives:
Part A:
1.  Carrying out of subprojects comprising electrification of
about 7000 rural villages and about 2.1 million new consumers
in the second and third years of Repelita VI (1995/96 to
1996/97) through the construction of an estimated 28,000
kilometer-circuit (kmc) of medium-voltage (MV) lines and 35,000
kmc of low-voltage (LV) lines, 1.3 million poles and 833
megavolt-ampere (MVA) of distribution transformer capacity.
2.  Development and implementation of economic sub-transmission
schemes aimed at promoting private sector participation in
small scale generation by interconnecting captive power plants,
cogeneration plants and other small power producers willing to
Page  12
sell power to a PLN regional or mini-grid serving a rural area.
3.  Carrying out of subprojects comprising: (a) the installation
of mini-hydro schemes at five sites in Sulawesi and Eastern
Indonesia ranging in size from 0.86 megawatt (MW) to 2.6 MW
with an aggregate capacity of about 7.5 MW using a run-of-river
design and requiring minimal pondage; and (b) the testing of
two mini-geothermal fields at Sembalun in Lombok and Tulehu in
Ambon through test well drilling, well monitoring and testing.
4.  Carrying out of pilot projects to test the adaptability of
low cost equipment designs, low cost network reticulation
designs, and more efficient construction management methods.
5.  Expansion of the rural small business services component
under the Rural Electrification Project (LN. 3180-IND) to
promote productive uses of electricity by businesses in rural
areas including participation by non-governmental
organizations.
6.  Provision of technical assistance for: (a) enhancing the
rural electrification planning systems capability within PLN
and transferring it to PLN regions and branches; (b)
organizational restructuring of PLN's rural electrification
management and operational units; (c) preparation of a
renewable energy development master plan for rural
electrification in areas not likely to be covered by PLN's
major regional grids within the next ten years; (d) capacity
building of PMU; (e) expansion of Pola schemes; and (f)
implementation of Parts A.1-A.5 of the Project.
7.  Preparation of environmental assessment and management plan,
detailed feasibility and design studies, and the work plan and
cost estimates for field development and power plant
construction for mini-geothermal fields at Sembalun in Lombok
and Tulehu in Ambon.
Part B:
1.  Provision of technical assistance for: (a) implementation
and expansion of the management services agreements and Schemes
I and II (Pola I and II) for local participation by village
level cooperatives and organizations in power distribution
related activities; and (b) development of up to two geographic
areas for possible conversion to Scheme III (Pola III).

          (ii)  Prior to or at the time of each such request, the
                Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the documents
                and other evidence required pursuant to para-
                graph 4 of this Schedule for the payment or
                payments in respect of which replenishment is
                requested. On the basis of each such request, the
                Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw
                from the Loan Account and deposit into the
                Special Account such amount as the Borrower shall
                have requested and as shall have been shown by
                said documents and other evidence to have been
                paid out of the Special Account for eligible
                expenditures.
All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan
Account under the respective eligible Categories, and in the
respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by
said documents and other evidence.
4.  For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall
reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and
other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively
for eligible expenditures.
5.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further
deposits into the Special Account:
    (a)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that
Page  15
all further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly
from the Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of
Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) of
Section 2.02 of this Agreement;
    (b)   if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the
Bank, within the period of time specified in Section 4.01 (b)
(ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of
the audit of the records and accounts for the Special Account;
    (c)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the
Borrower of its intention to suspend in whole or in part theright of the Borrower to 
make withdrawals from the Loan Account
pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General
Conditions; or
    (d)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated
to the eligible Categories, minus the total amount of all
outstanding special commitments entered into by the Bank
pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect
to the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount
of the Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible
Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall
specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals
shall be made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall
have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit
in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be
utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.
6.  (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an
expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph
2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence
furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank
may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if
the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal
to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so
eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree,
no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall
be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made
such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
    (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required
to cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to
the Bank such outstanding amount.
    (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to
the Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the
Special Account.
    (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a),
(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan
Account for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in
accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement,
including the General Conditions.
