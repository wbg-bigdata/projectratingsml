MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR THE
SECOND RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
1.         The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of
Indonesia for $398.0 million to help finance the Second Rural Electrification Project is submitted for
approval. The proposed Bank loan would be for 20 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate. The proceeds of the loan, except for $2.2 million for the Ministry of
Cooperatives and Small Enterprises Development (MOC), would be onlent to the State Electricity
Corporation (PLN) for 20 years including a grace period of five years. The subsidiary loan will be
denominated in foreign currency withdrawn and the onlending interest rate would be equal to the Bank's
standard variable interest rate plus 0.5 percent per annum. PLN will bear the foreign exchange risk.
2.         Background. The power sector in Indonesia has been growing at a pace unmatched by
most countries. PLN's sales grew from 1982 to 1993 by about 15 percent per year and are projected to
grow at a comparable pace during Repelita VI (1994-1998). The investment requirements for Repelita
VI for expansion of PLN's facilities are estimated to be about $20 billion (in 1993 prices). The primary
issues confronting the sector center around the challenge of providing reliable service at competitive
prices, while rapidly expanding the access of electricity to consumers throughout the country. Increased
resource mobilization -- by implementation of sound tariff policies and promoting private sector
participation -- and enhancing efficiency are the twin challenges facing PLN and the sector.
3.         Government's Strategy. GOI's strategy for the electricity sector has three main objectives:
(i) rapidly increasing the availability of reliable electricity supply to foster socio-economic development,
(ii) enhancing efficiency and productivity in the utilization of the country's energy resources and
complementary inputs in the provision of electricity, and (iii) environmental conservation. The socio-
economic objective which is the principal focus of the rural electrification (RE) program, is to support
geographically balanced development of rural areas by increasing the welfare of the people and
stimulating the growth of economic activities. RE is a key and integral part of the Government's rural
development strategy; its long-term target is to electrify all villages and to enable the people to afford the
basic services provided by energy. However, despite the over seven-fold increase in the number of
villages electrified between 1980 and 1994, the rural village electrification ratio is currently about 50
percent, which is low compared to ratios of 80 to 95 + percent achieved in the many other countries in
the region. In terms of the connected rural household population, Indonesia has even further to go.
Indonesia's total population is about 186 million, of which nearly three quarters lives in an estimated
62,000 rural villages (23,000 in Java and 39,000 outside Java). The rural household electrification ratio
today is approximately 32 percent (38 percent in Java and 23 percent outside Java); compared to ratios
of about 60 percent achieved by some of the countries in the region (notably, Malaysia, Philippines,
Thailand). Under Repelita VI, PLN's target is to increase the rural household electrification ratio to
about 45 percent by 1998.
4.         Bank's Past Involvement in the Sector. The Bank has provided about $4 billion to the
electricity sector since 1969, through twenty one power projects, of which 14 have been completed and



- 2 -
PCRs prepared for them. Taken altogether, these projects have assisted in the expansion of generation,
transmission and distribution facilities and rural electrification and institutional development of PLN. The
technical assistance provided by the Bank has also strengthened PLN's technical and management
capabilities in engineering, project design and implementation capabilities, distribution and rural
electrification planning, and corporate and financial planning. As a result of these efforts, PLN's
implementation capacity and operational efficiency have increased significantly; whereby it now handles
an investment program of about US$3 billion per year, and connects about one million new customers
annually.
5.          The Bank's first and ongoing lending operation for rural electrification (RE I, Loan 3180-
IND) provides US$329 million to finance the bulk of the foreign exchange costs of a time slice of the
RE development plan through FY 94/95. The Bank's objectives in the RE I project derive from the
findings of the Rural Electrification Review (report 6144-IND, 1986). In addition to helping finance
implementation of the physical program elements, the key objectives of RE I are aimed at development
of a RE Master Plan and upgrading of PLN's planning, technical and manpower capability in this area;
and reducing the costs of future RE development by promoting the development of appropriate technical
standards for equipment performance and network design and construction practices and reducing PLN's
costs. Other objectives were to provide an opportunity for the development of village-based local
participation in the form of managerial, technical and labor resources; increase the productive uses of
electricity by small businesses, establish financial transparency in PLN's accounting of the costs of rural
electrification, and personnel training for PLN and the Ministry of Cooperatives (MOC) to support the
RE program.
6.          By and large, the RE I project's scorecard vis-a-vis its objectives is favorable. The Master
Plan work-in-progress represents a major step forward in strengthening RE planning in Indonesia, and
is directly helping rationalize the sequencing of network (grid) reticulation in the proposed project;
including the allocation of national electrification targets by region, extensification and intensification
within each region, and village selection. The performance of the RE I project has to be seen in the
context of a gradual and continuous learning process. Thus, changes in equipment standards and
performance specifications and in network design, facilitated by the RE I project, provide the basis for
significant cost reductions in the equipment and material costs of the physical program in the next stage
of rural electrification under the proposed project. Furthermore, advanced knowledge coupled with PLN's
evolved state of technical readiness set the stage for testing pilot distribution projects in the proposed
project that would form the basis for further cost reduction in the next stage of RE, possibly supported
with Bank financing. Experience gained with local participation under RE I-- in the form of the Pola
program -- has been generally quite positive, and provides the basis for seeking a more ambitious and
larger scale promotion of this concept.
7.          Rationale for Bank Involvement. The constraints to efficient delivery of electricity in rural
areas are related predominately to broader power sector development and PLN organizational issues on
which the Bank is working closely with the Government and PLN. The Bank is promoting actions
whereby PLN accords rural electrification a more important role in its strategic planning. In this
connection, the Bank has established a close association with PLN in preparing the technical and
organizational basis for implementation in the proposed project. In the broader context of power sector
development, a convergence of views has been reached between the Bank and DGEED regarding the
main issues facing the sector, and on an agenda and action plan for regulatory and institutional reform.
The proposed lending operation together with the Sumatera and Kalimantan Power Project will ensure
continuation of this dialogue and Bank support for implementation of the first stage of the overall power



- 3 -
sector reform agenda; key elements of which, enhancing private sector development, increasing local
participation by community organizations in electricity distribution and by NGOs in promoting productive
uses of electricity , and institutional restructuring of PLN to enhance the efficiency of its RE and non-RE
operations and management, are consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Indonesia,
that was discussed by the Board on April 15, 1994.
8.          Project Objectives. The specific objectives of the proposed project, besides continuing
Bank support for the broader reform agenda for the power sector initiated under the Sumatera and
Kalimantan Power Project, are to: (a) advance the efforts begun under RE I project to place the rural
electrification program in Indonesia on an efficient and sustainable footing; (b) expand the coverage and
supply of electricity to rural areas through a time slice investment program; (c) establish incentives for
private sector and local cooperatives to take an increasingly larger share of RE distribution and
renewable energy development within the framework of a least cost RE Master Plan; (d) continue PLN's
institutional development to undertake RE planning and implementation, especially at the regional level;
and (e) undertake pilot distribution programs that have the potential for further reducing the costs of RE
extensification and intensification.
9.          Project Description. To achieve the above objectives, the proposed project would include
two main components:
(a) PLN component which includes: (i) electrification of 7000 rural villages and 2.1
million households, in the second and third years of Repelita VI (95/96-96/97); through the
construction of an estimated 28,000 kmc of MV lines and 35,000 kmc of LV lines, 1.3
million poles and 833 MVA of distribution transformer capacity; (ii) economic sub-
transmission schemes aimed at promoting private sector participation in small scale
generation by interconnecting captive power plants, cogeneration plants and other small
power producers that are prepared to sell power to a PLN regional or mini-grid serving
a rural area on the basis of a published small power purchase tariff to be offered by PLN.
This tariff is derived in a transparent manner from PLN's "avoided cost of supply" in
different regions, and made available to all such potential sellers on a non-discriminatory
and non-negotiated basis as per the terms of a simple and standard power purchase contract;
(iii) development of five mini-hydro power projects with an aggregate capacity of 7.45 MW
and field test drilling of two mini-geothermal fields in Lombok and Ambon for which power
plant construction would be considered for financing under a proposed follow-on Renewable
Energy Development project; (iv) pilot projects to test the adaptability of low cost "low
tech" equipment designs, low cost network reticulation designs and more efficient
construction management methods for full scale implementation at a subsequent stage,
possibly supported by a future Bank loan; (v) expansion of the ongoing small rural business
services component to promote productive uses of electricity, including participation by
NGOs; (vi) technical assistance for: (a) enhancing the RE planning systems capability within
PLN and transferring it to PLN Regions and branches; (b) preparation of a Renewable
Energy Development Plan for rural electrification in areas not likely to be covered by
PLN's major regional grids within the next ten years and; (c) implementing RE-specific
institutional changes required to enhance the organizational and management efficiency of
undertaking RE within PLN, consistent with the ongoing restructuring of PLN; and
(b) MOC component which includes: (i) implementation support for expansion of
schemes for local participation by village level cooperatives and organizations in power



- 4 -
distribution related activities; and (ii) preparation of up to two geographic areas for possible
conversion to a "Pola III" mode of organization, wherein responsibility for all distribution
functions including ownership of assets is transferred from PLN to a third party.
10.        Project Costs are estimated to be US$ 743 million, inclusive of duties, taxes, and physical
and price contingencies. The total financing required, including interest during construction and financing
charges on the Bank loan, amounts to about US$ 841 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$ 398.0
million equivalent to the Republic of Indonesia would finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost
exclusive of interest during construction and taxes, and about 47 percent of the total financing required.
Of this amount about US$ 2.2 million equivalent would be made available to the MOC, and the balance
of US$ 395.8 million equivalent would be on lent to PLN under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement. The
onlending term will be for 20 years, including five years grace period, and the onlending interest rate
would be equal to the Bank's standard variable rate plus 0.5 percent per annum. The foreign exchange
risk will be borne by PLN. Schedule A shows project costs and the financing plan. Schedule B sets forth
the amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement. Schedule C summarizes key project
processing events, and Schedule D summarizes the status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia. One
map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 12920-IND, dated February 3, 1995 is being
distributed separately.
11.        Project Implementation. PLN will be responsible for implementation of the entire physical
program in the project. The specific villages to be electrified as per the regional electrification targets
defined in the project will be based upon the use of village selection criteria acceptable to the Bank.
Expansion of the rural business services program will be the responsibility of PLN, with assistance from
NGOs in carrying out the necessary field work and outreach activities. The project component that is
aimed at increasing local participation in electricity distribution functions (the "Pola Program"), will be
jointly implemented by MOC and PLN. A key element of the implementation plan would be the
appointment of a Project Director as the focal person responsible for ensuring implementation, and
coordination and monitoring of all activities related to the project; and for undertaking the necessary
corrective actions in a timely manner. To ensure timely implementation of the physical program,
preparation of activities related to the tendering and procurement process are proposed to begin in
advance of the expected date of loan effectiveness in June 1995. In the case of pilot projects and TAs,
detailed TORs have been finalized to enable the contractor/consultant selection process to begin well in
advance of the expected date of loan effectiveness.
12.        Sustainability. The long term sustainability of the national rural electrification program
will depend upon the degree of success in minimizing the burden on Government resources to finance
the program investment and operations (without excessively burdening other consumer segments through
overly cross-subsiding retail electricity tariffs); while increasing access of service at a rapid pace and
ensuring its affordability to the rural household population. Thus, sustainability will depend upon
increasing the efficiency of investments as well operating efficiency, increasing the mobilization of non-
governmental resources, and through a tighter targeting of subsidies. This strategy underlies the design
of the project's components. The project will help enhance the efficiency of investment through a variety
of means, including reduction in the unit cost burden of RE delivery through least cost planning, lowering
of equipment and construction costs, and employing lower cost network designs and standards that are
appropriate for rural areas, and by changing PLN's RE-specific organizational structure and management
processes in order to create a mission oriented environment within which the RE managers themselves
will be more creative and energetic in seeking solutions that reduce the unit cost of RE and accelerate
the pace of program coverage.



13.        The proposed project incorporates several components/mechanisms that will provide strong
incentives and otherwise facilitate private sector and local participation by cooperatives and other
organizations in activities such as: (i) provision of generation capacity and energy -- e.g., captive power,
cogeneration, and other cost effective and renewable sources of electricity -- facilitated by implementation
of the published small power purchase tariff and a standard power purchase contract; (ii) undertaking
some functions related to retail electricity distribution otherwise performed at a higher cost by PLN,
facilitated by the "Pola Program" and; (iii) taking over all aspects of retail electricity distribution,
facilitated by the introduction of a bulk supply tariff.  The proposed project, by promoting the
implementation of a published small power purchase tariff and a bulk supply tariff, combined with the
establishment of profit centers within PLN in the context of the overall institutional reform agenda,
should ultimately lead to a desire to differentiate retail tariffs by region, narrow the present gap between
the retail tariff and the willingness to pay for such service in rural areas, thereby further enhancing the
sustainability of the program.
14.        Environment and Resettlement. The proposed project is not expected to pose significant
environmental and resettlement problems as it will consist of numerous, very small power generation,
and medium and low voltage distribution subprojects, and test well drilling at two mini-geothermal fields.
These subprojects, while having the potential to cause minor and localized impact, are not likely to be
large enough to warrant major environmental concern. Accordingly, the project has been assigned a "B"
classification. The environmental and resettlement impacts will be established by utilizing a screening
process based on guidelines satisfactory to the Bank; and people affected by any of the sub-projects will
be compensated and resettled on the basis of an agreed resettlement policy. A report on each sub-project
containing the relevant information on environment and land acquisition and resettlement measures will
be maintained by PLN, with a summary report to be sent to the Bank annually for review and comment;
and a technical audit of the overall project will include an evaluation of the environment and resettlement
aspects of the project.
15.        Agreements Reached with the Borrower. During the negotiations, the Bank reached the
following agreements with Borrower:
(a) The Borrower shall onlend the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan, except for the $2.2
million for technical assistance to the Ministry of Cooperatives, to PLN under a subsidiary

will be denominated in foreign currency withdrawn and the onlending interest rate would
be equal to the Bank's standard variable interest rate plus 0.5 percent per annum. In
addition, PLN will pay to GOI a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum or at such
other percentage rate as the Government shall pay to the Bank on the undisbursed amount
of the Subsidiary Loan from time to time. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by PLN.

of the goods, works, and services financed out of the proceeds of the Loan including
effective utilization thereof, operation and maintenance of the equipment, and the
environmental and resettlement aspects of the Subprojects; and (c) furnish to the Bank as
soon as available, but in case not later than September 30 of each such year, the report of

such technical audit by such auditors and such other information relating thereto in such
detail as the Bank may reasonably request:
(j) PLN shall: (a) undertake environmental screening, and resettlement and rehabilitation
planning for subprojects to be financed under the Loan in accordance with criteria and
procedures satisfactory to the Bank; (b) submit, for Bank's approval, a proposal for each
Subproject under the mini-hydro and mini-geothermal component of the project, to be
financed out of the proceeds of the Loan including environmental mitigation and/or
resettlement and rehabilitation measures therefor; (c) ensure that during the execution of
each subproject the environmental mitigation and resettlement and rehabilitation measures
therefor are carried out in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, and (d) by April 30 every year
commencing in 1996, furnish such information about the environmental mitigation and
resettlement and rehabilitation measures taken during the preceding fiscal year of the
Borrower in such detail as the Bank may reasonably request; and
(k) The following agreements with respect to PLN's financial performance, reached under
the Sumatera and Kalimantan Power Project, were reaffirmed: (i) PLN shall submit audited
accounts and reports no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year; (ii) PLN
shall not incur any additional debt unless a reasonable forecast of its net revenues after
expenditures for each year during the term of the debt to be incurred shall be at least 1.5
times its projected debt service requirements; (iii) PLN shall periodically review its LRMC
and tariff structure, and discuss the results of the review with the Government and the
Bank, and before October 31 in each year, commencing in 1995, review the adequacy of
its tariffs to meet the requirements of the revenue covenants, taking into account the results
of the review of the LRMC-based structure; (iv) PLN shall prepare a rolling ten-year
financial forecast and for the first five years of the forecast, prepare a financing plan; and
(v) PLN shall annually revalue its fixed assets and accumulated depreciation.
17.         Condition of effectiveness. Execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between Borrower
and PLN satisfactory to the Bank.
18.         Actions to be Taken before Withdrawal of Loan Proceeds. PLN shall complete, in a
manner satisfactory to the Bank, the environmental screening and conceptual engineering design for
environmental mitigation for well test drilling in the mini-geothermal component, before any
disbursements would be approved for that component of the project. Disbursement for the mini-hydro
projects will be conditional on Bank clearance of PLN's specific proposals for compensation and
resettlement measures for the affected persons.
19.         Benefits. The proposed project would increase the effectiveness of RE delivery by the
development and implementation of an efficient RE program in Indonesia, and hence lead to higher
returns and speedier coverage. It would help reduce present and future unit costs of RE and help address
a primary constraint to further enhancing the efficiency of RE delivery as well as the long term
sustainability of the RE program; by facilitating a significant change in PLN's present organizational
structure and management processes for the RE program. In addition, it would help extend the supply
of electricity in rural areas in Indonesia during 1995-1997 to 7,000 villages and thereby contributing to
a significant improvement in the quality of life of 2.1 million rural households -- with women and
children being primary beneficiaries -- and more broadly contributing to the development of rural areas,
by facilitating economic opportunity through productive uses of electricity.

20.        Project Risks No significant technical or implementation risks are foreseen with respect
to the physical network development program, that involves routine grid extensions and consumer
connections. PLN has consistently exceeded annual rural electrification targets and implementation
schedules. The risk associated with implementation of the mini-hydro is minimized by a technical design
that places emphasis on standardization, and ensuring appointment of highly qualified construction
management and supervisory contractor in the case of mini-hydro; and in the case of the mini-geothermal
component by employing an internationally reputed firm under a single integrated drilling services
contract. Risks associated with implementation of the overall policy reform agenda in general and other
elements of the policy component specific to RE -- institutional restructuring, and implementation of the
bulk supply tariff -- are minimal in view of the Government's and PLN's satisfactory record in
implementation once agreement is reached.
21.        Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
