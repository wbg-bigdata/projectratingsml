MYORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND
FOR A FOURTH HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
1.          I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  memorandum  and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Kingdom of Thailand for the equivalent
of US$177.5 million to help finance a Fourth Highway Sector Project. The loan
would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 17
years, including five years of grace.
2.          Country/Sector Background.  Thailand's  surging economic growth,
averaging 11.7* p.a. during 1986-90, has resulted in an explosive increase in
road transport, with traffic rising by an average 14% a year on the nation's
major highways since 1986 and the vehicle fleet (excluding motorcycles) expanding
at an average rate of more ttan 10% a year since 1984. Today, with some 7.6
million vehicles on the road, road transport represents 88% of freight and 92%
of passenger transport. In the future, with robust economic growth projected,
rising demand for road transport should continue, resulting in an expected
doubling of the vehicle fleet over the next 20 years and even faster increases
in traffic as vehicle utilization grows.
3.          Substantial investments in road infrastructure under the Government's
six development plans (1965-91) have facilitated the economic boom. The focus has
been on establishing a nationwide network of paved roads, which now total about
40,000  km,  and,  during  the  past  decade,  increasing  maintenance  and
rehabilitation. Under its sixth plan, the Government also began considering the
efficiency of road infrastructure utilization and th.e environmental and safety
problems associated with the growing vehicle fleet. With assistance under the
Bank's Third Highway Sector Project (Ln. 3220-TH), the Government prepared action
plans in three areas--vehicle emissions and noise, traffic safety, and road
transport efficiency, establishing the direction of the Seventh Highway Plan
(1992-96) of the Department of Highways (DOH) and the emphasis of Bank
participation in the Plan, i.e., to support implementation of Plan investments
as well as key components of the three action plans.
4.          The Seventh Highway Plan, covering the national and provincial road
networks, calls for expenditures of about B 200 billion (in current baht) (about
US$8 billion), including investments totaling almost B 136 billion. The
investments included in the Plan emphasize capacity increases to relieve
congestion, since the network is largely adequate in length but lacks sufficient
capacity to handle constantly rising traffic flows. Recurrent expenditures
proposed for maintenance are considered adequate. The Plan is based on sound
technical and economic criteria and is judged a suitable basis for the project.
5.          The project would also support key items included in the three action
plans. Transport-related air pollution in urban areas of Thailand is severe, with
unsafe levels of respirable particulate matter, carbon monoxide, lead, and toxic
contaminants like benzene. The problems are related to impure fuel and
lubricants, the predominance of leaded gasoline and high-sulfur-content diesel,
poor vehicle maintenance and the low average speed of urban traffic. Under the
action plan to reduce vehicle emissions and noise, the Government has already
increased air quality monitoring, required catalytic converters on new cars



-2-
manufactured after September 1993, required conversion of much of Bangkok's fleet
of taxis (both automobiles and three-wheeled "tuk-tuks") to cleaner fuels, and
increased availability of unleaded gasoline and low-sulfur diesel fuel while
domestic refineries are being modified. In the future, it will revise emissions
and noise standards, increase the average speed of urban traffic through traffic
management measures and, most important, improve and expand vehicle inspection
and enforcement of regulations.
6.          The action plan to increase traffic safety is aimed at curbing the
traffic accident rate, which climbed by at least 14% p.a. during 1982-89. The
plan addresses poorly designed road segments ("black spots"), poor vehicle
condition due to inadequate maintenance, and unsafe driver behavior. The
Government is already correcting blackspots, requires third-party liability
insurance for vehicle operators, and is preparing legislation requiring
motorcyclists to wear helmets. It will also expand and improve vehicle testing,
strengthen law enforcement and traffic surveillance, educate the public in
traffic safety, and strengthen the responsible institutions.
7.          The action plan for road transport industry efficiency is correcting
remaining deficiencies in the industry by liberalizing intercity bus transport
regulations, improving the management and skills of transport operators, and
increasing industry competitiveness and safety.
8.          Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations. Project completion
reports and performance audits of recent highway projects (Attachment C)
recognize DOH's strong performance and its success in achieving project
objectives. However, a Bangkok Traffic Management Project (Ln. 1638-TH, approved
end-1978) implemented by the city administration indicated the need for consensus
building and effective coordination when a number of agencies are involved in
carrying out difficult reforms. Preparation of the proposed project therefore
involved continuing consensus-building on the action plans, involvement of the
major implementing agencies in action plan preparation, nd designation of a
special unit to coordinate action plan implementation.
9.          Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank has long supported the
development of Thailand's highway network axud of DOH's institutional
capabilities. With DOH now an effective institution, the Bank has shifted to
considering subsector policy issues and strengthening the capacity of MOTC and
other institutions to address the issues identified. The Bank is acting as a
catalyst and a source of technical support to the Government on what are often
complex and politically sensitive issues. It is also bringing together various
agencies whose responsibilities overlap on these issues in a political
environment where official coordination has been difficult.
10.         groLiegt Olectives. The proposed project is aimed at improving the
efficiency and safety of the road subsector and mitigating its environmental
impact by: (a) supporting the preparation and implementation of an economically
justified program of investments for the national and provincial road network;
(b) assisting the implementation and coordination of actions to substantially
reduce environmental degradation and vehicular accidents due to the country's
rapidly growing motorization; and (c) promoting improved policies to enhance the
operational efficiency of road transport and road use.



3-
11.         Protect  Descrintion   Institutionally,  the  project  would  help
implement the three action plans and strengthen the institutions responsible for
their implementation- -the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) and its
Land Transport Department (LTD), which in 1988 became responsible for vehicle
inspection and administration of emissions and safety regulations. The action
plans, representing coordinated packages of policy and regulatory reforms,
procedural and institutional changes, and physical improvements, were developed
by a Coordinating Committee comprising representatives of the various responsible
agencies and chaired by LTD. The Fiscal Policy Office of the Ministry of Finance
provided support and oversight during plan preparation.
12.         The project would finance the following over a five-year period: (a)
civil works subprojects to rehabilitate, upgrade to paved standard, and improve
the safety and capacity of national and provincial roads and bridges included in
DOH's investment programs for FY1992-96 (93% of total costs); (b) equipment,
technical assistance and training to assist MOTC and LTD in preparing,
implementing and coordinating key components of three action plans to improve
road traffic safety, reduce vehicular air and noise pollution, and improve road
transport industry efficiency (6%); and (c) technical assistance to DOH to design
a long-term investment and financing strategy, including a study of the adequacy
of current road user charges, and a long-term plan for institutional developmcnt
(10).
13.         Estimated project costs total US$258 million, of which US$177.5
million would be financed by the proposed loan. Disbursements, especially for
capacity increases, are designed to be concentrated among a limited number of
large contracts, minimizing the required number of contracts to be directly
monitored under the loan. Bank financing of specific subprojects, therefore,
exceeds the foreign exchange component of these works and services but is well
below the overall foreign exchange requirements of the highway program. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursement, and the disbursement schedule, are shown
in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Thailand are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 10179-TH, dated February
10, 1992, is being distributed separately.
14.         Implementation.  The project would be carried out by DOH, LTD, and
other agencies responsible for action plan components, including the Bangkok
Metropolitan Administration, the Bangkok Metropolitan Transit Authority, the
traffic police, and the Office of the National Environment Board. NOTC would
oversee implementation, assisted by an Action Plans' Coordinating Unit (APCU) to
be established and assisted under the project. Civil works subprojects would be
selected on the basis of procedures and criteria, including a minimum economic
return of 12%, which were agreed with the Government under previous highway
sector projects.
15.         Sustainability. Project investments are considered sustainable. The
current effectiveness of the Government's maintenance and management of the
network are expected to continue in view of adequate provisions for maintenance
in the 1992-96 budget and institutional improvements to be designed under the
project to ensure the quality of long-term network management. The action plan



-4-
initiatives are designed to ensure the sustainability of legal and regulatory
changes by focussing on enforceuent and institutional development.   Project
preparation has focussed on building consensus and encouraging ar incremental
approach to change.
16.         Agreed Actions. Agreement was reached with the Governm.nt on: (a) its
annual review with the Bank of the scope and implementation of the three action
plans and of the Seventh Highway Plan, including the priority of road maintenance
and rehabilitation during periods of constrained resources; (b) annual
consultation with the Bank on action plan activities to be carried out during the
coming fiscal year; (c) implementation of a road financing and resource
mobilization study and discussion with the Bank of the study's recommendations
and the potential for their implementation; and (d) the evaluation methodology
for subproject selection. Selection of a consultant to assist the APCU would be
a condition of loan effectiveness. Retroactive financing ot US$10 million
equivalent is recommended for eligible expenditures made after September 20, 1991
to avoid interruptions to ongoing subprojects to be financed under the project.
17.         Environmental Aspects. Subprojects now proposed for inclusion in the
project would require little or no change in existing road alignments, and no
resettlement is anticipated. Environmental assessment (EA) procedures previously
agreed by DOH and the Bank would be applied to all projects included in the
Seventh Highway Plan. These procedures require screening of projects for their
environmental impacts during the feasibility study and incorporation of any
needed mitigative measures in the project design. Full EA reports, following
agreed guidelines, would be prepared for all projects entailing new rights-of-way
or significant environmental impacts. More positively, the project would help
improve air quality by supporting the design and implementation of a vehicle
testing program to better monitor and control vehicle emissions. Preparation of
future measures to improve air quality and reduce noise would also be supported.
18.         Prolect Benefits. Project support for the Seventh Highway Plan would
improve the capacity and condition of the national and nrovincial highway
networks, thus helping to meet the country's surging demand for road transport,
relieve transport bottlenecks and sustain the high rate of economic growth.
Subprojects to be funded under the project would have a minimum economic return
of 12%; subprojects already committed have rates of return of 13% to 66%. The
project would also continue Bank support of DOH's development and of LTD's
programs to reduce environmental degradation and vehicular accidents as well as
to increase the efficiency of road transport. The environmental and traffic
safety components are expected to yield substantial benefits for the general
public, particularly in urban areas.
19.         Risks. DOH's implementation of its investment program presents no
significant risk as the road works to be carried out largely follow the
alignments of existing roads, minimizing property disturbances and land
acquisition for rights-of-way. The main project risk relates to action plan
implementation. Implementation of some action plan measures could be delayed due
to the complexities involved, the need to emphasize enforcement, and the relative
inexperience of LTD and MOTC in dealing with such matters. To counter this
possibility, extensive use of technical assistance would be made under the
project to prepare and implement the various components and a coordinating unit



would be established to assist MOTC in the overview of action plan
implementation.
20.         Recommend.Atio. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
