(Guangrun) to use loan savings. Target values were not officially revised, but a case can be made that this
restructuring was not insignificant, and that original targets could have been formally revised and were
actually implicitly revised based on the amended legal documents of the project and the official documents
produced for the CDCF Hubei Guangrun Hydropower Development Project (see Section 3.4).

                That of the four original hydropower stations was slightly higher than planned
                  (728 GWh) because of additional capacity installed at Najitan and Xiakou.
                That of Guangrun (actual proven generation capacity per year) was only 11.8
                  GWh because of: (a) leaks occurring in Hongwawu’s reservoir and (b) the late

 Understood as the annual average energy capability (in GWh/year) in the PAD (Annex 2). The energy
capability (in GWh) from natural inflows of a hydroelectric plant in a given period is the maximum
quantity of electric energy that it could possibly produce or store with said inflows in the period considered,
on the assumption of complete utilization of the inflows and that all parts of the plant are efficient. The
average energy capability (in GWh) from natural inflows of a hydroelectric plant in a given period is the
arithmetic mean of the related energy capabilities during the largest possible number of consecutive years.

              five sub-projects were delayed (see Section 2.2). The four original sub-projects, as
              a whole, are within appraisal estimates but the Guangrun component is expected to
Comments exceed appraisal estimates by 33% (see Section 1.7). The four original hydropower
(incl. %      plants all passed government acceptance procedures and were built to high quality
achievement) standards. In the case of Guangrun, the leaks discovered in Hongwawu’s reservoir
              are expected to be resolved by June 2012 and Zhamushui is expected to be

Comments did not fully meet some of the financial performance indicators temporarily
(incl. %     because of delays in unit commissioning (respective average delays of 20 months
achievement) for Najitan and 16 months for Xiakou). Most of Guangrun’s financial performance

H. Restructuring (if any) – see Section 1.7

    07/31/2006: reallocation of loan proceeds and addition of a fifth component (Guangrun) to
     use loan savings.
    11/19/2008: first extension of the loan closing date (to June 30, 2010).
    06/30/2010: second extension of the loan closing date (to December 31, 2011).
    01/17/2011: The sponsor company for component 5, Hubei Guangrun Electric Power
     Development Company Limited (Guangrun Project Company), has completed legal

                                              xi
restructuring. Its majority shares (55%) have been bought out by Guodian Hubei Hydro
Power Development Company Limited (Guodian) from Hubei Guoxin Investment Company
Limited (Guoxin). The legal agreements for the Project are amended in due course as a result
of Guangrun Project Company’s restructuring to reflect the restructured company’s
obligations under the legal agreements for the project.

I. Disbursement Profile




                                          xii
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.     The CAS goals for the period 1998-2002 were to: reduce infrastructure bottlenecks by
adjusting the investment pattern in favor of water management, energy, transportation, and
telecommunications; adjust the balance between energy development and conservation; and develop
alternative energy sources. The CAS for the period 2003-2005 was being prepared at the time of
appraisal. Its overarching objective was to support China’s transition from a rural, agricultural
society to an urban, industrial society and from a centrally-planned to a more globally integrated
market-based economy – and to do it on a sustainable basis. Its three main objectives were: (a)
improving the business environment and accelerating the transition to a market economy; (b)
facilitating an environmentally sustainable development process; and (c) addressing the needs of the
poorer and disadvantaged people and lagging regions.
2.    The Bank’s energy sector strategy at that time contributed to these three objectives focusing on:
(a) transitioning the state owned energy sector to a diversely owned market based system; (b)
conversion to clean fuels and increasing energy efficiency; and (c) raising incomes in poorer western
areas by assisting them to develop and export their energy resources.
3.    The project – originally four (then extended to five during implementation) small to medium
hydropower projects located in poor western areas of Hubei Province – was designed to contribute
directly to the Bank’s three main objectives in the energy sector by addressing the issues discussed
below.
4.     Unreformed county and locally owned generation. Small hydropower plants were often
developed at low cost with local resources and expertise, such that substantial output and efficiency
increases could be expected with rehabilitation and up-rating. Sector reforms in the 80’s and 90’s had
left the county and locally owned generation virtually untouched. While there was nominal
corporatization, the corporate structures and responsibilities were unclear, and in practice the
generation entities remained part of local government at various levels. This affected their ability to
efficiently manage existing capacity, and to raise finance to carry out economically justified,
rehabilitation, up-rating and expansion.
5.    Replacement of coal fired generation. At the time of appraisal, 70 percent of county and
locally owned generation capacity in China was comprised of small (generally below 50 MW)
thermal power plants, of which 75 percent were coal fired, characterized by low efficiencies and high
atmospheric emissions. The proposed hydropower developments would directly replace coal-fired
generation.
6.    Energy Resource Development in Western Areas of China. The western part of Hubei
Province, where the proposed hydropower developments were located, is comprised of mountainous
areas that are topographically and culturally contiguous with the provinces which form part of the
officially designated western zone. This contiguity has been partly recognized by the central
government through its designation of Enshi Autonomous Prefecture (the location of three of the five
project counties) as part of the officially designated western zone. The other two project counties
were also poverty areas, although not in the officially designated western zone.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
7.   The project had three objectives: (a) facilitate economic growth in Hubei by expanding electric
power generation capacity in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner; (b) enhance

                                                  1
the efficiency of the electricity sector in Hubei by commercializing county level generation
companies; and (c) contribute to poverty alleviation efforts in poor communities in Hubei.
8.    The key outcome indicators for monitoring and evaluating performance were: increased
renewable generation capacity, corporatization of project companies, improvement of living
standards in the project counties (in particular those of resettlers), and proportion of fiscal revenues
generated by the project contributing to poverty alleviation in the project counties.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
9.    The PDO and the key indicators were not revised during implementation. Target values were
not officially revised, but a case can be made that the first restructuring (addition of a fifth
component, Guangrun) in July 2006 was not insignificant, and that original targets could have been
formally revised and were actually implicitly revised based on the amended legal documents of the
project and the official documents produced for the CDCF Hubei Guangrun Hydropower
Development Project (see Section 3.4).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
10.       The main beneficiaries of the project identified in the PAD were:
          Hubei Province, through its economic growth as a result of the project.
          The project companies through the construction and operation of the hydropower plants.
          The project counties and poor communities in these counties through: increased fiscal
           revenues generated by the project companies; allocation of 20 percent of these revenues to
           county poverty alleviation efforts (focusing on the poorest villages in the counties); various
           economic benefits (road improvements, multi-purpose benefits of the dams, new jobs during
           the construction and operation periods, etc); improvement of the county poverty alleviation
           planning process; and restoration and improvement of the living standards of resettlers who
           were living in poor, remote, and mountainous areas.
11. Although not explicitly stated in the PDO, the local and global environments were to benefit
through SO2, TSP, NOX, and CO2 emission reductions, as the proposed hydropower developments
would directly replace coal-fired generation.
12. Annex 4 gives more details about the main beneficiaries and the results chain, and establishes
clearly the causal links between project investments and the benefits expected to flow to beneficiaries.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
13. The project, as approved by the Board in June 2002, included four components in four poor
counties of Hubei Province: (i) Dongping Hydroelectric Power Station (2x55=110 MW), located in
Xuan’en County; (ii) Najitan Hydroelectric Power Station (3x12=36 MW), located in Laifeng
County; (iii) Songshuling Hydroelectric Power Station (4x12.5=50 MW), located in Zhushan County;
and (iv) Xiakou Hydroelectric Power Station (2x15=30 MW), located in Nanzhang County.
14.       Each component consisted of four activities, as follows:
      (a) Construction of a hydroelectric power station, including: (i) a single purpose concrete arch
          dam; (ii) a power house; (iii) an associated step-up sub-station; and (iv) construction of a
          transmission line to connect the power station to the grid.
      (b) Carrying out of a program of institutional strengthening, including: (i) development and
          implementation of appropriate organizational arrangements, staffing and information systems

                                                      2
          appropriate to the operational phase; and (ii) provision of training to the Project Company
          staff in project management and hydropower station operation.
      (c) Development of a plan for enhancement of poverty alleviation efforts in the county to be
          partially funded from the fiscal revenues accruing to the county as a result of the project.
      (d) Compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation of project affected persons.

1.6 Revised Components
15. In order to utilize the substantial loan savings of about US$16 million (see Note 1 in Annex 1),
a fifth component – Guangrun Hydropower Development Project – consisting of five activities was
added in 2005: three activities similar to activities b, c, d under the original four components, and the
following two activities:
      (a) Construction of a hydroelectric power station at Hongwawu, Jianshi County, Enshi
          Prefecture in Hubei Province, including: (i) a concrete slab rock-fill dam about 41.5 m high
          with a crest length of about 458 m; (ii) a first stage powerhouse with an installed capacity of
          8 (2x4) MW; (iii) a second stage powerhouse with an installed capacity of 10 (2x4 and 1x2)
          MW; and (iv) a 35 kV transmission line, approximately 4.6 km in length, to connect the two
          powerhouses to Zhamushui step-up substation.
      (b) Construction of a hydroelectric power station at Zhamushui, Jianshi County, Enshi Prefecture,
          in Hubei Province, including: (i) a concrete double-curvature arch dam about 77.5 m high
          with a crest length of about 142 m; (ii) a powerhouse with an installed capacity of 10 (2x5)
          MW; (iii) an associated step-up substation; and (iv) construction of a 110 kV transmission
          line approximately 12 km in length to connect Zhamushui substation to the electricity grid.
16. This change was approved by the RVP. The Loan Agreement was amended in July 2006 and a
Project Agreement for the new Guangrun component was prepared in January 2007.

1.7 Other significant changes
17.    There were several significant changes to the original project design, as described below:
(a) Changes of shareholders. In the four original project companies, county-level shareholders have
    fully withdrawn (except for Najitan, where they have substantially withdrawn), and the shares
    were bought by professional companies; however, the county governments were still entitled to
    relevant tax revenues. In Guangrun (registered in Jianshi County), the main sponsor, Guoxin
    Company, which held 55 percent of the shares, sold its shares to Guodian Company in May 2010.
(b) Najitan capacity upgrade from 36 (3x12) MW to 51 (3x17) MW. The original planned
    capacity (36 MW) was quite low in order to reach the design plant capability of 149 GWh per
    year. The new capacity (51 MW) was in line with the three other sub-projects in terms of average
    number of generation hours.
(c) Reduction of Xiakou’s flood control subsidy (originally: RMB 51.8 million, 18 percent of
    the sub-project cost). This subsidy was to be provided jointly by the Provincial Water
    Resources Bureau, with a share of 75 percent (RMB 38.8 million), and by Nanzhang County,
    with a share of 25 percent (RMB 13 million). However, Nanzhang County provided only RMB 5
    million and the Provincial Water Resources Bureau did not provide its part of the subsidy. This
    was due to a policy adjustment in 2005. Since the Provincial Water Resources Bureau did not
    have sufficient budget to provide flood control subsidies for the treatment of both small and large
    rivers, they decided to focus on the treatment of large rivers, and considering that the Juhe River
    (on which Xiakou was built) was a small river, the subsidy was not provided to Xiakou.

                                                    3
(d) Changes to the closing date. An 18 month extension of the loan was provided to finalize
    Zhamushui’s design and due to unexpected severe weather conditions (snow storm and floods in
    2008). In March 2010, the loan closing date was extended by another 18 months (to December 31,
    2011) to remedy the financing gap issue (see Note 3 in Annex 1) and enable the Zhamushui
    works to be completed.
(e) Increased cost of the Guangrun component. The cost of the Guangrun component is expected
    to reach RMB 390 million (33 percent higher than estimates in 2006) because of unforeseen
    geological conditions, price increases (of both labor and raw materials), higher interest during
    construction, and increased cost of resettlement.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
18. Quality at entry was satisfactory. The PDO and the project design were closely aligned with the
Bank’s energy sector strategy in China and the three objectives of the CAS for the period 2003-2005.
Lessons learned from previous Bank-financed hydropower and water resource development projects
were taken into account during project preparation and would prove pertinent during implementation.
19. The rationale for the project and for Banks intervention was clear and well defined. Project
counties were keen to develop their small and medium hydropower resources, which in many cases
constituted their main source for revenue enhancement. The Bank could assist in establishing the
required institutional capacity and appropriate commercial arrangements which, together with the
“comfort? of Bank involvement would provide the necessary creditworthiness with local commercial
banks that would co-finance the project.
20. The project design was well thought out. Its focus on enhancing the social and environmental
development benefits of hydropower investment was relatively innovative at the time. Resettlement
arising from the project was to be treated as a development opportunity for affected communities. A
benefit sharing scheme was designed ensuring that counties would earmark 20 percent of the fiscal
revenues they received as a result of the project to poverty alleviation activities. Technical assistance
to strengthen county poverty alleviation planning was included in the project. Borrower commitment
for preparation was high. Risks and mitigation measures were well assessed for the original four
components. A Dam Safety Panel of Experts (POE) was appointed and financed by the project to
carry out expert independent technical reviews throughout the preparation and implementation
phases (satisfying the requirements of OP 4.37 / BP 4.37: Safety of Dams).
21. The new Guangrun component represented an improvement over the original four components,
as it brought together a series of financial and poverty alleviation instruments to enhance the
performance of the project. Through participation in the Community Development Carbon Fund
(CDCF) additional revenues were provided to investors (through the purchase of CERs), and to
poverty alleviation activities (see Annex 6).

2.2 Implementation
22. The implementation of the original four components was satisfactory. By the end of 2005, loan
savings of US$16 million were identified, and the Guangrun component was added to scale up
project impacts. Major factors that affected the project are summarized below.




                                                   4
23.   Major factors that affected the project negatively:
(a) Delays in commissioning of 20 months for Najitan, 8 months for Songshuling, 16 months for
    Xiakou, and 25 months (expected) for Guangrun had a negative impact on the financial
    performance of these companies. These delays were the consequence of the following root
    causes:
(b) Procurement delays (all components except Dongping). The original sub-projects, except
    Dongping (for which all goods were non-Bank financed), suffered from a seven month delay in
    the procurement of the main turbine and generator contract (ICB) due to delays in the domestic
    approval process. This delay directly affected the construction progress of the three sub-projects,
    since this equipment was needed to complete the powerhouses. In the case of Guangrun,
    procurement of the main civil works contract for the Zhamushui dam and powerhouse had to be
    cancelled as it could not be concluded within the bid validity period.
(c) Major design change in Najitan. Although it was necessary, it resulted in an overall one year
    delay, adding to the delay of the procurement of the main turbine and generator contract.
(d) Unforeseen geological conditions in Guangrun. Leaks were discovered in the Hongwawu
    reservoir due to Karst caves that needed to be treated; these are expected to be completed only by
    June 2012. The Zhamushui dam also faced technical difficulties, with two faults and one fracture
    zone discovered in the left abutment during the excavation; the zone has now been satisfactorily
    reinforced.
(e) Weak capacity of Guoxin Company, Guangrun component. Guoxin was a trade company
    with very weak technical and managerial capacity for planning, building, and operating the
    project. They were relying on outside experts and consultants for the technical work and were
    short of staff to lead the execution of the two sub-projects (Hongwawu and Zhamushui)
    simultaneously to start power generation as early as possible and generate revenues.
(f) Lack of government funding commitment in Xiakou and Guangrun. As 90 percent of the
    flood control subsidy was not granted to Xiakou by provincial and local authorities, this sub-
    project had a financing gap which delayed construction. Local banks were not willing to lend to
    the company unless it showed better financial results. Construction stopped between September
    and November 2005 and this financing issue was resolved by the company registering to the
    CDM and getting additional CDM revenues. Local banks were then willing to lend again to the
    company. In the case of Guangrun, the county government failed to provide the financial support
    agreed at appraisal in 2005.This issue was resolved only when Guodian became the principal
    shareholder of the company (see Note 3 in Annex 1).
24.   Major factors that affected the project positively:
(g) Carbon Credits. Four of the five companies successfully applied to the CDM for carbon credits
    (until the end of 2012 for three of them, and until 2016 for Guangrun). This will contribute
    positively to their financial performance by generating additional revenues.
(h) Change of shareholders. The withdrawal of county-level shareholders for the four original sub-
    projects and of Guoxin Company in Guangrun, and their replacement by professional (provincial
    or national) sponsors strengthened the project companies from technical, managerial, and
    financial standpoints, and enabled county-level sponsors to re-invest their assets in other county
    development projects.




                                                  5
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
25. M&E Design. The M&E program was designed on a set of indicators corresponding to the
three objectives of the PDO (outcome indicators) and to the project’s physical progress and financial
performance (intermediate indicators). Overall, the indicators were relatively appropriate to measure
the project’s objectives but, in hindsight, could have been refined and simplified to some extent (see
Annex 4 on M&E Design).
26. M&E Implementation. Implementation of the M&E system focused on regular reporting on
the outcome and intermediate indicators, as well as feedback on issues and their resolution. Data was
reported semi-annually in the project progress reports (physical progress and financial performance)
and in the external monitoring reports (for data relating to the improvement of living standards).
Compliance with financial covenants was regularly monitored and utilized to assess the financial
viability of the companies. Consultants funded by the BNWPP Trust Fund carried out a study to
comprehensively review, document, and assess the poverty alleviation impacts of the project. The
quality and reliability of the data used in the ICR is good and is based on these sources and on the
data provided by the project companies in their ICRs.
27. M&E Utilization. Project companies will continue to track their financial performance as well
their annual plant operation costs. County-level living standards are monitored and reported annually
in government statistics. In addition, the implementation of village-level poverty alleviation plans
will continue to be monitored and reported to the affected population and counties in a poverty
information booklet distributed every year (see Annex 6).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
28. The project was a Category A because of the construction of the dams and the scale of
resettlement.
29. Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01). Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and
Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) were prepared for the five components. These included
the organizational setup, monitoring approach and methodology, and institutional strengthening and
training to ensure smooth implementation and quality performance. Efforts were made to implement
the EMP fully, and to mitigate and monitor the project’s impact. Effective measures were taken
promptly to ensure that all environmental indicators were within acceptable levels at all times.
Monitoring results indicate that air, noise, and water pollution were controlled and met the relevant
national environmental standards and certification requirements. The four original sub-projects met
the official environmental acceptance requirements, and Hongwawu and Zhamushui are expected to
meet them by June 2013.
30. Safety of Dams (OP 4.37). A Dam Safety Panel of Experts (POE) was appointed to carry out
expert independent technical review throughout the preparation and implementation phases. To
ensure the safety of dams, instrumentation systems were installed and became operational; one will
be installed at Zhamushui by June 2012. Quality assurance procedures were prepared7 and followed,
as confirmed by regular POE reviews. Zhamushui faced technical difficulties, with two faults and
one fracture zone discovered in the left abutment during the excavation; this zone was satisfactorily
reinforced subsequently. In June 2012, the Guangrun Company carried out an independent dam
safety review of Zhamushui before its impoundment, and the conclusions of the review were
satisfactory.

7
 The following four plans were developed for each of the six dams: quality assurance plan, instrumentation plan,
operation and maintenance plan, and emergency preparedness plan.

                                                       6
31. Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12). The project was to treat the resettlement arising from
the sub-projects as a development opportunity to improve the living standards of the affected
population. The land acquisition and resettlement involved two provinces (Hubei and Hunan) and six
counties. A total of 1,451 hectares were acquired and 4,062 people were resettled. 10,768 people
were affected by land acquisition or physical relocation. Most affected people were classified as
rural. Resettlement was completed in a satisfactory manner. The living conditions of project affected
people in terms of income level and quality of life have substantially improved (see Annex 5 on
Resettlement).
32. Procurement (OP/BP 11.00). The project procurement packages covered civil works,
electrical and mechanical equipment, and consulting services. These activities were effectively
organized and carried out in accordance with Bank guidelines, ensuring the transparency and
effectiveness of the process, and contributed to the procurement of high quality goods and services at
very competitive prices. There were, however, two cases of significant procurement delays, as
mentioned in Section 2.2.
33. Financial Management (OP/BP 10.02). Project financial management met acceptable
standards. The five project companies maintained dedicated accounts for the project and prepared the
respective computerized project and corporate financial statements on a regular basis. Annual audit
reports were submitted to the Bank on time, and no significant issues were identified. Financial
management supervision and selected post reviews of project accounts, documentations, and internal
control procedures confirmed that management of project funds was sound.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
34. Original four components. The four original sub-projects have been in successful commercial
operation since 2007, and are financially sound (see Section 3.3). Training and study tours delivered
under the TA program of the project were arranged for plant operation staff. They also took part in
the various design, procurement and testing activities during project construction to familiarize
themselves with all facets of operation and maintenance (O&M). In parallel, preparation of the O&M
codes, and operational procedures for the hydropower plants and reservoirs was completed. A
complete set of monitoring equipment has been installed at each dam.
35. Guangrun component. Hongwawu started commercial operation in September 2009 with the
commissioning of the first 10 MW, generating 11.2 GWh during the first year of operation (a low
average number of generation hours per year of 1120). The addition of the remaining 8 MW in
November 2010, however, did not bring substantial additional power generation due to the low
volume of water in the Hongwawu reservoir. Serious leaks discovered in the reservoir a few months
after its impoundment (due to Karst caves) are being treated, and will be completed by June 2012.
Zhamushui is also expected to be completed and operational by June 2012. The official resettlement
acceptance procedure for the two sub-projects has been carried out satisfactorily. The remaining
official acceptance procedures are expected to be completed by June 2013. The Bank will monitor
the Guangrun component as part of the supervision of the CDCF until 2016. In particular, it will keep
tracking CERs and key project indicators, and monitor the financial performance of the company.
The preparation of the O&M codes, and operational procedures for the hydropower plants and
reservoirs was completed. The project company, Guodian, is one of the largest power producers in
China, and its involvement is a guarantee of Guangrun’s long-term sustainability.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Satisfactory
36. The project’s objectives and design were and remain consistent with the country’s energy
priorities. China being highly dependent on fossil fuels, with coal accounting for about 70 percent of
primary energy consumption, and only 8.8 percent of energy coming from renewable sources,
shifting to a greener energy supply will benefit both China and the world. The 12th Five-Year Plan
(2011-2015) aims to reduce carbon intensity by 17 percent, and contribute to the overarching goal of
reducing the economy’s carbon intensity by 40-45 percent during 2005 to 2020.
37. The project’s objectives and design were and remain consistent with the Bank Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) with China. The PDO is aligned with the two strategic themes of the CPS
for FY2013-FY2016, which is currently being finalized: (a) supporting greener growth (and, in
particular, shifting to a sustainable energy path); and (b) promoting more equitable development.
38. The project’s objectives and design also were and remain consistent with the WBG energy
strategy8 (addressing two key objectives: environmental sustainability and direct poverty alleviation)
and with the twin objectives of the proposed WBG energy strategy under preparation, namely: (a)
improving access and reliability of energy supply; and (b) facilitating the shift to a more
environmentally sustainable energy development path.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Satisfactory (both against the original project objectives – Case 1: “the four original
components? – and against the implicitly revised project objectives – Case 2: “the five components?).

a) Facilitate economic growth in Hubei by expanding electric power generation capacity in an
economically and environmentally sustainable manner – Satisfactory
39. At project closing, 18 of Guangrun’s planned 28 MW were installed and, because of leaks
detected in Hongwawu’s reservoir, were generating only 11.8 GWh per year. Based on the average
annual number of generation hours9 of the four original sub-projects (2223 hours between 2007 and
2011) located in the same area with similar annual precipitation levels, this could have been achieved
with about 5.3 MW. In addition, Zhamushui’s dam was still under construction and its 10 MW was
expected to be commissioned in June 2012.
40. Consequently, at project closing the equivalent of 248 MW (242.6 MW for the original four
components and 5.3 MW for Guangrun) was operating at full scale, very close to the target10: 254
MW (226 MW for the original four components and 28 MW for Guangrun).
41. Electric power generation capacity had indeed been expanded in an environmentally
sustainable manner and in an economical manner. At project closing, RMB 2.192 billion had been
spent for the equivalent of 248 MW (RMB 8,839/kW), a two percent higher cost per kW capacity
installed than was estimated at appraisal (RMB 8,646/kW) due to cost overruns for Guangrun.

  Comprising the 1999 environmental strategy for the energy sector, Fuel for Thought, and the informal 2001 energy
strategy entitled “The WBG energy program: poverty alleviation, sustainability, and selectivity?.
9
  The average annual number of generation hours of the four original sub-projects between 2007 and 2011 varied
between 2000 (Songshuling) and 2394 (Najitan). The average was 2223 hours. Dongping and Xiakou were close to
the average, respectively at: 2265 and 2234 hours.
10
   See footnote 3 p. iii: Guangrun’s targets were implicitly set at the time of restructuring on 07/31/2006.

                                                        8
42. The tariffs of the five components were relatively competitive in Hubei Province, varying
between RMB 0.341/kWh (Najitan) to RMB 0.4/kWh (Xiakou), an average of RMB 0.364/kWh for
the five components.
43. This project contributes to generate significant local and global environmental benefits (see
Annex 4). In addition, as mentioned earlier, efforts were made to implement the EMP fully, and to
mitigate and monitor the project’s impact. The four original sub-projects met the official
environmental acceptance requirements, and Hongwawu and Zhamushui are expected to meet them
by June 2013.

(b) Enhance the efficiency of the electricity sector in Hubei by commercializing county level
generation companies – Satisfactory
44. Studies carried out during project preparation had already addressed some of the weaknesses of
small hydropower companies described in Section 1.1 and had resulted in: (a) the corporate and
financial restructuring and corporatization of county level generation companies in the host counties;
(b) changes in sponsorship and ownership structure of the project companies to ensure financial
viability during project implementation; and (c) financial projections to ensure financial viability
during operation. The institutional strengthening program under the project was designed to ensure
that, once the components would be completed, the companies would operate their assets efficiently.
45. Power Purchase Agreements and Tariffs (Satisfactory). At project closing, all five
hydropower companies are corporatized and commercially operated. They have signed a year-to-year
power purchase agreement with Hubei Provincial Power Company (HPPC), which owns and
operates the transmission grid in Hubei Province. As mentioned above, the tariffs are relatively close
and competitive.
46. Changes of Shareholders (Satisfactory). The involvement of professional sponsors, replacing
county-level shareholders for the four original sub-projects, and of Guodian Company for Guangrun,
is a positive development, as mentioned earlier.
47. Financial Performance of the Companies (Satisfactory in Case 1, and Moderately
Satisfactory in Case 2). The four original project companies are financially viable, making a
reasonable return on equity (with an average FIRR on equity investment of 8.6 percent11). However,
Guodian Guangrun Company, once Zhamushui will be operating and under the conservative
assumption that Hongwawu’s leaks will be only partly resolved, will only achieve an average FIRR
on equity investment of 2.1 percent; this could go up to 5.1 percent if the leaks are fully resolved and
if the tariff is increased to RMB 0.38/kW.
48. Plant Operation Performance (Satisfactory). The four original companies are running their
hydropower plants efficiently, with operation costs that are quite competitive for hydropower plants
of this type in China. Their staffing levels are quite low and efficient. Guodian Guangrun Company
is not yet staffed up to optimum levels; once the leaks are addressed and Zhamushui commissioned,
the company is expected to reach acceptable performance levels.

(c) Contribute to poverty alleviation efforts in poor communities in Hubei – Satisfactory
49. The five project counties were all poverty counties at the time of appraisal in 2002, four of
them nationally designated, with net rural incomes around RMB 1,500 per capita per year (US$0.54
per day), and the fifth, Nanzhang, provincially designated with an income of RMB 2,208 per capita
11
  This includes the CDM revenues for three of the four companies (all except Songshuling). The average real FIRR
on total investment for the four original sub-projects is 5.9 percent.

                                                       9
per year. The high incidence of poverty in the project areas is mainly attributable to the mountainous
terrain in which they are located resulting in poor access and climate, limited farmland resources and
lack of non-farm opportunities.
50. Socio-economic conditions of the project counties have greatly improved between 2002 and
2011, and rural areas in these counties have basically graduated from absolute poverty and are
now close to graduating from vulnerable poverty.
51. The poverty alleviation activities and impacts of the project are comprehensively documented
in Annex 6. The project specifically contributed to poverty alleviation efforts in these counties by:
     Improving the living standards of resettlers;
     Generating RMB 8.44 million for poverty alleviation efforts in the five counties;
     Generating other economic benefits to the counties, including road improvements, new jobs
       during the construction and operation periods, several multipurpose benefits of the dams; and
     Carrying out a TA study to enhance county poverty alleviation planning.

3.3 Efficiency12
Rating: Satisfactory
-Satisfactory against the original project objectives (Case 1: “the four original components?);
-Moderately Satisfactory against the implicitly revised project objectives (Case 2: “the five
components?).

52. Cost Performance (Satisfactory). As mentioned earlier, electric power generation capacity
has been expanded in an environmentally sustainable manner and in an economical manner.
53. Financial Performance (Satisfactory in Case 1, and Moderately Satisfactory in Case 2) –
FIRR on Total Investment: 5.2% vs. PAD 8.9% (Case 2) – see Annex 3. The original four project
companies (Case 1) are financially viable, making a satisfactory return on equity (with an average
FIRR on equity investment of 8.6 percent). However, Guodian Guangrun Company, once Zhamushui
will be operating and under the conservative assumption13 that Hongwawu’s leaks will be only partly
resolved, will only achieve an average FIRR on equity investment of 2.1 percent. This could go up to
5.1 percent if the leaks are fully resolved and if the tariff is increased to RMB 0.38/kWh. Because of
the low financial performance of the Guangrun component and the significant difference with the
financial performance expected at appraisal, the overall financial performance of the project in Case
2 is rated moderately satisfactory.
54. Economic Analysis (Satisfactory in Case 1, and Moderately Satisfactory in Case 2) – see
Annex 3. In Case 1, the EIRR is 12.5% (above the 12% threshold) and the NPV is US$6.4 million
(PV2000), which is satisfactory. In Case 2, because of the Guangrun component, the post-completion
NPV of US$-17.3 million (PV2000) and EIRR of 11.0% are lower than the corresponding appraisal
estimates of an NPV of US$47.3 million (PV2000) and EIRR of 14.6%. This is the PAD’s “base
case? scenario, which also includes local environmental benefits (SO2, TSP, and NOX reduction
benefits), with a conservative assumption for Guangrun. However, the addition of global

12
   This analysis is made for the physical investments (six dams) and their associated resettlement. This represents
99.88% of the total cost of the project and the TA activities (institutional strengthening program and poverty
alleviation planning TA) 0.12% of the total cost of the project.
13
   Conservative assumption assuming that the number of GWh generated at Hongwawu will only double to reach a
low 23.6 GWh per year, implying a low average number of generation hours per year of 1311 when that of the four
other sub-projects, located in the same western area of the province with similar annual precipitation levels, was on
average 2223 over the last five years of operation.

                                                        10
environmental benefits (CO2 reduction benefits) makes the entire project fully economically
justified.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
55. Despite the restructuring in July 2006, with the addition of the fifth component (Guangrun), the
original project objectives (as encompassed by the stated PDO and key associated outcome targets)
were not formally revised, therefore the overall outcome rating should normally be that of the four
original components (i.e. Satisfactory).
56. But a case can be made that this restructuring was not insignificant, and that original targets
could have been formally revised. Actually, one could defend that Guangrun’s targets were implicitly
set at the time of the restructuring based on the amended legal documents for the project and the
official documents produced for the CDCF Hubei Guangrun Hydropower Development Project (the
PID, and the CER delivery targets set in the ERPA). To see how this case would compare to the
satisfactory rating of the project against the original project targets, an evaluation is made according
to the ICR guidelines for rating the outcome of projects with formally revised objectives, as follows:

                            Loan
                        Disbursement     Relevance          PDO           Efficiency       Outcome
                        (USD millions)
 As of July 2006
                             78              S                S               S                S
 (Case 1)
 Between July 2006
 and closing (Case 2)        27              S                S              MS               MS


57. In July 2006, the project was rated Satisfactory against the original project objectives (with a
weighted value 5 x 78/105 = 3.7), while at project closing, it would be rated Moderately Satisfactory
against the implicitly revised project objectives (with a weighted value 4 x 27/105 = 1.0), making a
weighted average score of 3.7 + 1.0 = 4.7, that is Satisfactory (5) with rounding.
58. In this weighted average case (as per guidelines for restructured projects), the overall outcome
rating of the project is Satisfactory. A similar evaluation would conclude that the efficiency of the
project is Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
59. The project had an explicit poverty reduction theme (see Section 3.2 and Annex 6). It also
supported continued high economic growth in Hubei Province through increased electric power
generation capacity, and increased fiscal revenues generated by the project companies. The estimated
tax revenue increase of about RMB 42 million per year including VAT (accruing to the county,
provincial, and national levels) makes resources available for supporting more social programs. The
extensive construction activities and support services during implementation and operation also
provided job opportunities locally.
60. Resettlement arising from the project was treated as a development opportunity for affected
communities. Their living conditions in terms of income level and quality of life have improved
substantially (see Annex 5).

                                                  11
61. Gender Aspects. The CBDP in Jianshi County (see Annex 6) included a few village-level
drinking water access projects that resulted in reducing the burden of fetching water for household
consumption, which was often done by women, walking several hundred meters usually twice or
three times a day, carrying heavy loads of water on their shoulders.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
62. The project had two TA activities: (a) poverty alleviation planning TA, and (b) institutional
strengthening program. The poverty alleviation planning TA contributed to improving the poverty
alleviation planning methodology of the project. The institutional program supported a series of
study tour / training programs to North America, Europe, and Australasia and provided consulting
services to assist the project companies. These substantially enhanced the capacity of project
companies to coordinate and manage complex tasks and issues.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
Not applicable.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Negligible to Low
63. Original four components. At completion, the four original sub-projects had already been in
production for almost five years and are financially sound. Main parameters for their successful
operation are not likely to change. The companies are expected to remain fully staffed and continue
to run well. The quality of civil work is good, the instrumentation systems are fully functioning, the
emergency preparedness system is in place, and the risk of dam failures has been under continuous
review and is assessed as minimal at the time of the ICR.
64. Guangrun component. The outcome ratings in the ICR are based on the actual situation at
project closing. Hongwawu’s leaks are expected to be resolved by June 2012, but by that time, it will
not be possible yet to fully measure and ascertain the annual generation gains likely to be achieved
(hence the conservative scenario for the financial analysis). Therefore, changes will certainly occur in
the next year or so, compared to the situation observed at closing for the entire project, but they can
only be favorable to the project’s outcomes, as follows:
     If the leaks are fully resolved and if the tariff is increased to RMB 0.38/kWh14 (which is quite
        likely given the leverage of Guodian Company at the provincial level and the justification for
        this request), then Guangrun’s FIRR on equity investment could go up to 5.1 percent. The
        financial and economic performances of the five components (Case 2) would be satisfactory.
     If the leaks are fully resolved, and therefore Guangrun’s 28 MW are fully utilized then the
        cost performance of the overall project, measured by the cost per kW capacity installed,
        would be very satisfactory: RMB 8,359/kW (RMB 2.262 billion spent for 270.6 MW: 242.6
        MW for the original four components and 28 MW for Guangrun), three percent lower than
        the RMB 8,646/kW ratio estimated at appraisal.
65. In all circumstances, the involvement of Guodian, a very large power company, further
strengthens the continued sustainability of this component and minimizes the risk to development

14
  Guodian Guangrun Company is under discussion with the Hubei Provincial Pricing Bureau to request a tariff
increase of RMB 0.02/kWh to cover the additional cost of resettlement (due to an increase in compensation rates)
and part of the increased construction cost due to unforeseen geological conditions.

                                                      12
outcome. The FIRR on equity investment would be in the range of 2.1 to 5.1 percent, so good enough
to keep them in the long term since national policies in China encourage power producers to have a
minimum share of renewable energy projects like this one in their portfolio, and these are not always
the most profitable projects.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
66. As summarized in Sections 1.1 and 2.1, the Bank’s support for the project was based on solid
rationale, and the quality at entry it helped ascertain is considered satisfactory.
67. For the four original sub-projects, the Bank assisted the Borrower in designing the project to
meet Bank technical, financial, economic, and fiduciary requirements. It also helped shape the TA
and training programs to strengthen the institutional capacity of the counties and the project
companies.
68. The design of the Guangrun component was an improvement over the original four
components. It was fully appraised, and was an effective way of utilizing loan savings to enhance the
achievement of project objectives. However, the following risks were not identified and managed:
    – Guoxin was a trade company with no experience in small hydropower plant construction and
       operation. A possible TA program could have been devised to remedy Guoxin’s technical
       and managerial weaknesses.
    – Thorough investigations were not conducted to assess the possible presence of Karst caves in
       the location of the Hongwawu reservoir. It should be noted that the feasibility study report
       and preliminary designs were prepared by the same design institute that prepared the original
       four components and the POE reviewed the preparation of this component and was consulted
       by the Bank on technical aspects.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
69. Adequacy of supervision inputs and processes. Over the nine and a half years of project
implementation, supervision was planned and carried out approximately twice a year. Supervision
teams were appropriately staffed to address and report on implementation issues as they emerged.
Early supervision focused on procurement, particularly with regards to the main equipment package
(for three of the original four components), which was on the critical path of implementation.
Subsequent supervision monitored the various technical issues related to construction, installation,
testing and commissioning, quality of work, and kept close tabs on remedial actions taken by
suppliers and contractors.
70. Supervision of fiduciary and safeguards aspects. The Bank monitored the implementation of
the RAP and EMP regularly, and compliance with Bank fiduciary and safeguards policies.
Supervision missions regularly reviewed the financial statements and audit reports of the
implementing agencies. Discussions covered issues such as disbursements, tariffs, financial
projections, and compliance with financial covenants.
71. The focus on development impact throughout supervision was good. The Bank diligently
supervised the quality and safety aspects of the assets built under the project. The dam safety POE
was closely involved throughout implementation and made several concrete recommendations at the

                                                 13
final design and construction stages, which were taken into account. The Bank’s focus on the
development impacts of technical assistance was also significant. In the case of Najitan, the Bank
was instrumental in solving a dispute on claims between the project owner and the main contractor.
In 2007, the Bank obtained consultant support through the BNWPP Trust Fund to carry out a study to
comprehensively review, assess, and document the poverty alleviation impacts of the project.
72. Candor and quality of performance reporting. Supervision reports were generally realistic,
candid, internally consistent, and focused on the PDOs. Management letters highlighted key issues to
be brought to the attention of the implementing agencies, and the provincial and national levels.
Ratings in ISRs were fair and are broadly consistent with those at the ICR stage.
73. Transition arrangements are adequate. The Bank will continue to monitor the Guangrun
component as part of the supervision of the CDCF until 2016 (see Section 2.5).
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
74. Overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory, based on the ratings for quality at entry and
supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
75. Overall, government performance is rated moderately satisfactory. Government was committed
to the project during preparation and was proactive in utilizing loan savings. However, the
unavailability of some counterpart funding for the Xiakou and Guangrun components impacted the
project negatively. The Guangrun component was put at serious risk, until Guodian, one of the
largest power producers in China, purchased Guoxin’s shares.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
76. Implementing agencies’ (project companies) performance is rated satisfactory since the original
four companies and Guodian performed well. It should be noted, however, that the Guangrun
component was affected during 2006-2010 when Guoxin managed its implementation, as a result of
Guoxin’s weak technical, managerial, and procurement capacity.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
77. Overall borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory based on the ratings of the
performance of the government and the implementing agencies.

6. Lessons Learned
78. Lesson 1. Small to medium hydropower projects located in poor counties can be designed
as holistic county development projects. This project is a good example of what can be
accomplished and the tools that can be developed:
   – Resettlement arising from such projects can be treated as a development opportunity to
       improve the living standards of affected populations.
   – Significant tax revenues can accrue to the county, provincial, and national governments
       and constitute additional resources for supporting development programs.


                                                14
   –   Benefit sharing schemes can be designed to increase the financing of county-level poverty
       alleviation efforts by earmarking part of the fiscal revenues accruing to the counties.
   –   Financial tools like the CDCF can be used to combine environmental and social
       development objectives, and thus constitute a “carbon reduction plus development? approach.
   –   Such projects can generate other economic benefits in the counties, e.g., road
       improvements, new jobs during the construction and operation periods, several multipurpose
       benefits of the dams, etc.
   –   Technical assistance activities under the project can enhance county poverty alleviation
       planning.
79. Lesson 2. In the context of China, there is no need to allocate large amounts of
contingencies (US$13 million in this case) to infrastructure projects of this type. This lesson has
actually already been taken into account by the Bank, and since 2004 the Bank no longer finances
large amounts of contingencies.
80. To reap the full benefits of small hydropower project development and prevent the
occurrence of major delays and issues putting the project at risk, the following factors should be
assessed by the Bank at the appraisal stage and ensured throughout the implementation stage:
     Strong support from government (local and provincial) to the project, and full commitment to
       the implementation arrangements agreed with the Bank at appraisal.
     Implementing agency with good financial, technical, and managerial capacity. An assessment
       of the proposed implementing agency’s capacity on these three points at the appraisal stage is
       crucial. Financial capacity and interest in the project alone are not sufficient. If a new
       component is to be carried out by an implementing agency with weak technical and
       managerial capacity, a TA program should be included to address these weaknesses.
     Sufficient geological investigations should be carried out during the preparation stage not
       only at the location of the dam, but also at the site of the reservoir.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
81. The Hubei Provincial Project Management Office commented that the Bank’s ICR made a true
and precise description of the project, and a fair and objective appraisal of the outcomes. A summary
of the borrower’s ICR is included in Annex 10. No specific issues were raised by the borrower.
(b) Co-financiers
None.
(c) Other partners and stakeholders
(e.g. NGOs/private sector/civil society)

Annex 1. Project Costs and Financing

Note 1: Given the continuous depreciation of the US Dollar against the Chinese RMB between 2005
and 2012 (from 8.28 to 6.30 RMB), and the relatively limited financial contribution of the Bank loan
to the overall project (about 37% of total financing needs; therefore 63% of the funds were mobilized
by counterparts in RMB), it makes more sense to present, assess, and discuss in the ICR the project
cost figures in RMB. However, for internal World Bank reporting needs, they are also “artificially?
displayed in USD as follows: 1 USD disbursed at an average exchange rate of RMB 8.11 for the
original four components (between 2002 and 2007) and at RMB 6.89 for the Guangrun component
(between 2008 and 2011). These rates follow the disbursement rates of the Bank loan. USD appraisal
estimates are from the PAD.

Note 2: Cost estimates of the main civil works and equipment packages for the original four
components proved to be 13 percent higher than actual contract prices. Together with the
cancellation of Bank financing for one large contract15, these resulted in significant loan savings
(US$15.97 million). At appraisal in 2002, design institutes in China still used “norm? prices to
prepare civil cost estimates; these were 15 to 20 percent higher than market prices. This practice is no
longer in use.

Note 3: Financing gap issue for Guangrun: In March 2010, Hongwawu’s first 10 MW had been in
operation since September 2009 and the other 8 MW was planned to be commissioned in November
2010. The World Bank loan was fully disbursed but Zhamushui’s construction was still at the very
beginning. This was caused by a significant shortage of funds of the company due to: (i) a shortfall of
the World Bank loan of about RMB 18 million because of the constant depreciation of the US Dollar
against the Chinese RMB between 2006 and 2010; (ii) Jianshi County had still not honored its
commitment of providing a RMB 20 million interest-free loan to the company (actually committing
to finance the interests of a RMB 20 million commercial loan borrowed from a local bank); and (iii)
because the RMB 20 million interest-free loan had not yet materialized, given its tight financial
situation and the lack of commitment of the county government, the company could not borrow from
commercial banks the remaining RMB 50 million needed to close their financing gap. In March
2010, the Bank decided to extend the loan closing date on the condition that this issue would be
solved by June 30, 2010 to properly close the project by supervising safeguards compliance
(Zhamushui’s resettlement had not yet started) and ensuring the safety of the two dams under
construction.

Overall financial situation of the components (PAD vs. actual or expected in June 2012 –
conservative assumption for Guangrun).
2.     The original four project companies (Case 1) are financially viable, achieving a satisfactory
return on equity (with an average FIRR on equity investment of 8.6 percent). The average FIRR on
total investment of the original four project companies (5.9 percent) is also satisfactory, although less
than the 9.1 percent expected at appraisal. The main reason for this is on average during the first
years of operation 23 percent less sales than expected at appraisal (542 vs. 708 GWh) because of
lower precipitations in this area of Hubei Province between 2007 and 2011. Another reason is the late
commissioning of units compared with the planned schedule in the PAD (respective delays of 20

17
     Average weighted either by sales (GWh) or by investment (total investment or equity investment as appropriate).

                                                          24
months for Najitan, 8 months for Songshuling, and 16 months for Xiakou). Dongping’s two units,
however, were commissioned 4 months ahead of schedule. Tariffs are slightly lower than expected at
appraisal but this is partly compensated by the additional CDM revenues.
3.    However for Guangrun, once Zhamushui begins operating and under the conservative
assumption18 that Hongwawu’s leaks will be only partly resolved, Guodian Guangrun Company will
achieve an average FIRR on equity investment of 2.1 percent. This could go up to 5.1 percent if the
leaks are fully resolved and if the tariff is increased to RMB 0.38/kWh. The main reasons for
Guangrun’s much lower financial performance compared to appraisal are: (a) a 33 percent cost
increase; (b) much lower sales (high sales are not guaranteed at project closing because of the leaks
occurring in Hongwawu’s reservoir); and (c) significant delays in unit commissioning (expected to
be 25 months when Zhamushui’s 10 MW are commissioned).
4.    Because of the low financial performance of the Guangrun component and therefore, the
significant difference from the financial performance expected at appraisal for the entire project, the
overall financial performance of the project in Case 2 is rated moderately satisfactory.

2. Economic Analysis

Economic Performance (Satisfactory in Case 1, and Moderately Satisfactory in Case 2) –
EIRR: 11.0% vs. PAD 14.6%. NPV(PV2000)=US$-17.3 million vs. PAD US$47.3 million (Case
2 under PAD’s local / base case).

5.     EIRR and NPV of the entire project at the appraisal stage, including Guangrun. Before
comparing the economic performance of the entire project at the appraisal and closing stages (Case
2), the EIRR and the NPV of the entire project at the appraisal stage must be reassessed following the
PAD methodology but including the Guangrun component added in 2006. The economic analysis in
the PAD had distinguished two cases:
      A base case, including local emission benefits (SO2, TSP, and NOX reduction benefits); and
      A second case, including local and global emission benefits (CO2 reduction benefits).
6.    A traditional economic analysis (NPV at 12 percent) gives the following results:

                                      EIRR                                     EIRR

  Conservative assumption assuming that the number of GWh generated at Hongwawu will only double to reach a
low 23.6 GWh per year, implying a low average number of generation hours per year of 1311 when that of the four
other sub-projects, located in the same western area of the province with similar annual precipitation levels, was on
average 2223 over the last five years of operation.

7.   The results of the PAD’s base case for the entire project at appraisal are the following:
NPV=US$47.3 million (PV2000); EIRR = 14.6%. If global environmental benefits (CO2 reduction
benefit) are included, the NPV (PV2000) of the five components reaches US$63.4 million and the
EIRR 15.8%.

8.    At closing, the same economic analysis was carried out, using the same assumptions as for the
financial analysis in Part 1:
     Actual costs for the original four components and estimated cost for Guangrun in June 2012.
     Actual tariffs for the five components (RMB 0.36/kWh for Guangrun).
     Operating period of 30 years. Sales projections equal to actual average annual sales (in GWh)
        observed between 2007 and 2011 for the original four components and estimated annual sales
        for Guangrun (conservative assumption – see previous footnote).
     CO2 reduction benefits are valued at €8/ton (actual average price paid by CER buyers to
        Dongping, Najitan, Xiakou, and Guangrun Companies).

9.     In ICR Case 1 (the original four project companies) and under the PAD’s local / base case, the
EIRR is 12.5% (above the 12% threshold) and the NPV is US$6.4 million (PV2000), which is
satisfactory.
10. In ICR Case 2, because of the Guangrun component, the results of the PAD’s base case for the
entire project at closing are: NPV=US$-17.3 million (PV2000); EIRR=11.0%. If global
environmental benefits (CO2 reduction benefit) are included, the NPV (PV2000) of the five
components reaches US$63.8 million and the EIRR 16.0%. The EIRR (16.0%) is slightly higher than
at the appraisal stage (15.8%), although for the base case scenario, it is much lower (11.0% compared
to 14.6% at the appraisal stage). This is because the PAD assumed a price of US$1.85/ton for CO2
reduction benefits (2000 USD), compared to the average price of €8/ton paid by CER buyers to
Dongping, Najitan, Xiakou, and Guangrun Companies.


                                                   26
11. If multipurpose benefits of the dams are included (irrigation, flood control, and water supply),
valued at RMB 7.9 million per year, the EIRR of the five components under the base (local) case
reaches 11.9%. Thus, under the conservative assumption that Hongwawu’s leaks will be only partly
resolved, the EIRR of the entire project locally is just at the limit of the 12 percent hurdle rate. Only
the addition of the global environmental benefits makes it fully economically justified.
12. The main reasons for the lower economic performance of the entire project at closing
(under the local / base case) compared to the appraisal stage are the same as those cited for the
financial analysis.
13. In the case where Guangrun’s leaks would be fully resolved and if Guangrun’s tariff is
increased to RMB 0.38/kWh, a similar economic analysis would give the following results in ICR

-With local and global emission benefits: EIRR=16.5%; NPV=US$73.7 million (PV2000).

14. Multipurpose benefits of the dams (irrigation, flood control, and water supply) are
needed to ensure the economic justification of the entire project at the local level (because of the
low economic performance of the Guangrun component). Then the EIRR of the five components
under the PAD’s base (local) case reaches 12.4%, just above the 12 percent hurdle rate. Global
environmental benefits make the project fully economically justified.

2. M&E Design

The M&E program was designed on a set of indicators corresponding to the three objectives of the
PDO (outcome indicators) and to the project’s physical progress and financial performance
(intermediate indicators). Overall, the indicators were relatively appropriate to measure the project’s
objectives but, in hindsight, they could have been refined and simplified, as follows:
   First objective: facilitate economic growth in Hubei by expanding electric power generation
    capacity in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner. Indicator 1.3
    (improvement of resettlers living standards) should have been added under the third objective
    (contribution to poverty alleviation efforts). Indicator 1.2 (completion and implementation of
    EMPs) is a Bank requirement and was not needed. Furthermore indicators 1.2 and 1.3 were
    redundant, since they also appear as intermediate indicators. The original target for the increased
    renewable generation capacity in Hubei according to the PAD (p. 84) should have been 708 and
    not 604 GWh (maximum design capacity installed). To measure the “economical expansion? of
    power generation, some efficiency indicator could have been added, for example: cost per kW
    capacity installed compared with generating units of similar size elsewhere in China. Local and
    global environmental benefits (tons of SO2, TSP, NOX, and CO2 saved) compared to the coal-
    fired generation scenario could have been reported.
   Second objective: enhance the efficiency of the electricity sector in Hubei by
    commercializing county level generation companies. The indicators could have been adjusted
    (see above table for examples of outcome indicators that could have been used).
   Third objective: contribute to poverty alleviation efforts in poor communities in Hubei.
    Although it is good to report county-level living standards (indicator 3.1), the project on its own
    is not the only factor contributing to an improvement of county-level living standards.
    Furthermore, indicators 3.3 (increased proportion of county revenues devoted to poverty
    alleviation) and 3.4 (proportion of fiscal revenues generated by the project contributed to the
    county poverty alleviation fund) are redundant and indicator 3.4 was sufficient. The following
    three indicators could have been used to measure the impacts of the project on poverty
    alleviation: (a) indicator 1.3 (improvement of resettlers living standards); (b) additional county
    revenues (in RMB millions) generated by the project and dedicated to county poverty alleviation
    efforts; and (c) key implementation dates of the TA study to enhance county poverty alleviation
    planning. See the above table and Annex 6 for a comprehensive overview of the results chain and
    of the poverty alleviation impacts of the project.

Annex 5. Resettlement

1.   The project was to treat the resettlement arising from the sub-projects as a development
opportunity to improve the living standards of the affected population.
2.     Overall, resettlement was satisfactory. Resettlement actions have achieved the basic
objectives of: (a) compensating project affected people (PAPs) for their losses at replacement cost
prior to the actual move; (b) assisting with the move and providing rehabilitation during the transition
period in the resettlement site; and (c) assisting project affected people in their efforts to restore their
livelihoods. The key factors supporting the favorable outcome were:
     Good institutional arrangements and capacity of staff;
     Supportive leadership and availability of funds;
     Effective coordination with major agencies and stakeholders;
     Systematic program of consultation with the project affected people and their participation.
3.   PAPs were largely satisfied with the resettlement and compensations. Their living conditions in
terms of income level and quality of life have substantially improved (as detailed below in paragraph
10: Resettlers Living Standards).
4.    Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs). A resettlement action plan (RAP) was prepared for each
of the five sub-projects (a RAP, dated December 7, 2005, was prepared for the Guangrun sub-project
that was added later). The overall objective of the RAPs was that affected people would benefit from
the project and improve or, at least, restore their living standard.
5.     Provisions for Minorities. Three of the sub-projects (Dongping, Najitan, and Guangrun) were
located in Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture which, at its request, was designated as such
in 1982. The Najitan Project also involved some resettlement in Longshan County, which belongs to
Xiangxi Tujia Autonomous Prefecture in Hunan Province. Despite the presence of officially
designated minorities in the project area, the social and economic survey carried out as part of the
resettlement planning process indicated a high degree of acculturation within project counties as a
whole and in affected communities. Following review and discussion of the Social Assessment and
of mission reports at the appraisal stage, it was agreed that the people within the project area were not
the intended targets of OD 4.20 (“Indigenous Peoples?), and that an Indigenous Peoples
Development Plan was not required.
6.    Institutional Arrangements. Implementation of resettlement was carried out by the local
county governments, which had sufficient experience in resettlement. To ensure that resettlement
followed the RAPs, resettlement monitoring was divided into two parts, internal and external.
Internal monitoring was organized by the Project Resettlement Offices and carried out by the
township resettlement offices and village groups, while the external monitoring was conducted by
consultants (East China Investigation and Design Institute) who assisted in the preparation of the
RAPs in accordance with Bank requirements and who had extensive experience in external
monitoring of resettlement in Bank projects.
7.    Scope of Resettlement. Land acquisition and resettlement involved two provinces (Hubei and
Hunan) and six counties. A total of 1,451 hectares were acquired and 4,062 people were resettled, as
shown in the table below. Overall, 10,768 people were affected by land acquisition or physical
relocation. Most affected people were classified as rural. The resettlement work of Dongping and
Songshuling was relatively timely; that of the three other sub-projects was delayed (as were the three
sub-projects), but were not on their actual critical path.

8.    The actual surface of land acquired and number of persons resettled slightly exceeded those at
appraisal (by roughly 300 hectares and 400 persons), mainly due to the Dongping sub-project. Some
of it was caused by land sliding occurring around the reservoir, increasing its size and therefore the
surface of land to be acquired and compensated.
9.    Cost of Resettlement. The total cost of implementing the RAP was RMB 271.4 million, 55
percent more than the amount estimated at appraisal (RMB 175.5 million). The main reasons for the
cost increase were:

    For Dongping (+RMB 58 million)
     – Increased land acquisition and subsequently of the number of resettlers as mentioned above
        (some RMB 20 million).
     – Construction of Lianhuaba protection dike at the end of the reservoir to avoid inundation of
        high-yield farmland.
     – Substantial increase of compensation rates for all PAPs to align them with those of the larger
        Shuibuya Hydropower Project (1,600 MW) located downstream of Dongping as requested by
        the Xuan’en County Government (a cost increase of RMB 34 million together with the
        Lianhuaba protection dike).




                                                  32
    For Najitan (+RMB 20 million)
     – Increased land acquisition and subsequently of the number of resettlers, seemingly because of
        land sliding occurring around the reservoir explaining about 13% of the cost increase for
        Najitan’s resettlement (some RMB 4 million).
     – Actual cost of the road between Najitan and Longshan County (Hunan) that was
        underestimated at appraisal (by some RMB 8 million).
     – Increase of land compensation rates from RMB 6,600 to RMB 9,600 per mu in Laifeng
        County (Hubei) and increased compensation rates for all PAPs located in Longshan County
        (Hunan) to align them with those of the Wanmipo Project.

    For Songshuling (+RMB 14 million)
     – Increased land acquisition and number of resettlers (some additional RMB 5 million).
     – Increased cost of Liangjia and Zhuxiang roads (some additional RMB 9 million).

    For Guangrun (+RMB 7 million)
     – Substantial increase in the compensation rates between 2011 and 2006, especially for
        Zhamushui where resettlement was delayed (since this sub-project was delayed).

10. Resettlers Living Standards. The project was to treat the resettlement arising from the sub-
projects as a development opportunity to improve the living standards of the affected population.
PAPs were largely satisfied by the resettlement and compensations. Their living conditions in terms
of income level and quality of life have been substantially improved as discussed below.
11. Income Level. The average net annual per capita income of PAPs of the original four sub-
projects was RMB 1,722 (US$0.57 per day) in 2002, before the start of resettlement activities. It
reached RMB 2,639 in 2007 (a 53 percent increase) when the resettlement for these four sub-projects
was completed and was RMB 4,566 (US$1.92 per day) in 2011. In the case of Guangrun, located in
the poorer Jianshi County, the net annual per capita income of PAPs has almost doubled from RMB
1,931 in 2007 to RMB 3,438 in 2011 (reaching US$1.45 per day).

12. In almost ten years, PAPs have basically graduated from absolute poverty (defined by the
Central Government as below US$0.6 a day per capita income in 2000, equivalent to about RMB
2,400 per year in 2012, taking into account of inflation in China), and are now close to graduating
from vulnerable poverty (defined by the Central Government as below US$1 a day per capita income
in 2000, equivalent to RMB 4,000 per year in 2012). This trend is well aligned with the general trend
observed in rural areas in these five counties and is therefore not specifically attributable to the
project.
13. However, without the project, the economic situation of PAPs would not have been as good as
it is now, because of the following specific impacts of the project on PAPs:
   Compensation rates for three of the five sub-projects (Dongping, Najitan, and Guangrun),
    accounting for 75% of PAPs and resettlers under the project, were substantially increased.
   In addition to their annual income, all resettlers (only resettlers and not all PAPs) will receive an
    annual subsidy of RMB 600 from the Central Government for 20 years (until 2026) following
    national regulations on reservoir rehabilitation assistance.
   Before the start of the project, some resettlers did not have access to basic infrastructure services
    (road, water supply, and electricity). After the project, all resettlers had access to basic
    infrastructure services (road, water supply, and electricity).
   New houses are of better quality than before resettlement (often new cement-brick houses with
    modern amenities that are much better than old homes) and often much larger (for example, 58
    percent larger in the case of Songshuling).
   Other benefits (beyond those considered as required for income restoration of resettlers) stem
    from increased irrigation (due to conversion of land, upgrading of canals, reduced pumping costs,
    increased reliability of flows etc), increased cage fishing, reduced flood damage, etc.

14. Resettlement Acceptance Procedure. All five components went through an official
resettlement acceptance procedure and were rated “satisfactory? (Zhamushui was done in April
2012). The evaluations praised the sub-projects for their good resettlement work and the
improvement in resettlers living standards highlighted above.

Annex 6. Poverty Alleviation Impacts of the Project

1.    The project counties were all poverty counties at the time of appraisal in 2002, four of them
nationally designated, with net rural incomes around RMB 1,500 per capita per year (US$0.54 per
day), and the fifth, Nanzhang, provincially designated, with an income of RMB 2,208 per capita per
year. The high incidence of poverty in the project areas is mainly attributable to the mountainous
terrain in which they are located, resulting in poor access and climate, limited farmland resources,
and lack of non-farm opportunities.
2.  One of the three objectives of the project was to contribute to poverty alleviation efforts in poor
communities in Hubei through:
     1. Improving the living standards of resettlers;
     2. Generating additional fiscal income to the counties, and allocating 20 percent of these
        revenues to county poverty alleviation efforts (for the first five years of plant operation);
     3. Generating various other economic benefits to the counties, e.g., road improvements, new
        jobs during the construction and operation periods, and several multipurpose benefits; and
     4. Carrying out a TA study to enhance county poverty alleviation planning.

1. Generating additional fiscal income to the counties

3.    17 percent of fiscal revenues generated by the project accrued to the counties (the remaining 83
percent went to the provincial and central levels). Over a five year period (2007 – 2011), this
represented for the four original sub-projects combined, a total annual average of about RMB 6
million.
4.    As per the Project Agreement, 20 percent of this amount (the “World Bank project poverty
earmarked funds?) had to be allocated to county poverty alleviation funds to finance county
poverty alleviation efforts. Over a five year period (2007 – 2011), the four original sub-projects
altogether generated RMB 1.2 million per year on average for the World Bank project poverty
earmarked funds.
5.    In the case of Guangrun, the five year sub-project contribution to the Jianshi County poverty
alleviation fund will start in June 2012 after commissioning of the Zhamushui plant. However, the
ERPA signed between the Bank and the Guangrun Company (using the Community Development
Carbon Fund – CDCF21) included an advance payment of US$388,000 (RMB 2.44 million in 2006)
on the carbon credits to be generated by the project to fund part of a Community Benefit
Development Plan (CBDP). The CBDP sought to address poverty alleviation in the nine villages
affected by the sub-project (located in Yezhou Township). Its design was aligned with the larger
Jianshi County poverty alleviation master plan. Once operational, Guangrun is expected to contribute
some RMB 100,000 to RMB 150,000 per year to the Jianshi County poverty alleviation fund for five
years (2013-2017).
6.    The project poverty earmarked funds represented on average 1.5 percent of the total poverty
alleviation funds of the counties. However, since counties’ own contributions to their poverty
alleviation funds were relatively limited (only 2 percent before the project, with the bulk of the funds
coming from the provincial and central levels), these additional revenues almost doubled counties’
own contributions to their poverty alleviation funds.
21
   The CDCF provides carbon finance to projects in the poorer areas of the developing world that combine
community development attributes with emission reductions to create “development plus carbon? credits, and
significantly improve the lives of the poor and their local environment.

2. Generating various other economic benefits to the counties

7.    In addition to these additional fiscal revenues to the counties, the project had various other
significant economic impacts on the counties through: (a) road improvements benefiting a population
of 176,000; (b) new jobs during the construction period (estimated at 5,300) and the operation period
(181 staff); and (c) several multipurpose benefits of some RMB 7.9 million per year.

(a) Direct Benefits from Project Construction
8.     Improvements in roads in the project areas due to project construction were substantial since an
all-weather road was constructed to each dam site. Experience has shown that road access is one of
the most important infrastructure requirements to allow communities to improve their living standard.
Private bus and truck operators respond as soon as a serviceable road is opened. People are more
inclined to go for off-farm work when the bus service is cheap and frequent. Lower trucking costs
give incentives to grow new crops for the market, and middle men are more likely to visit villages to
pick up cash crops. Schoolteachers are more willing to work in a village if it is easily accessible, and
older students have access to schools of higher level. A frequent benefit cited by villagers is easier
access to hospitals. In Nanzhang, the Xiakou component built and upgraded 53 km of roads, in
comparison with the 40 km of roads constructed in the project areas in the five years preceding the
start of the project. Similar figures for Xuan’en are 61 km and 53 km, and for Laifeng 58 km and 57
km, respectively. The population benefiting from road construction and upgrading was estimated at
111,280 in Nanzhang, 57,873 in Xuan’en, and 7,100 in Laifeng. Road quality is probably a better
measure of improvement. In the years preceding the start of the project, the average cost for township
and village road construction (mostly earth roads less than three meters in width) was RMB 16,000
per km. In contrast, roads constructed under the project were Class 2-4 roads, with average
investment of RMB 150,000 per km.

(b) Employment
9.    While the mechanization of hydropower project construction has reduced the need for labor in
actual construction, these numbers were supplemented by substantial employment created in local
industries providing construction materials. According to estimates by the relevant counties at the
appraisal stage, the project was to create 1,000 employment opportunities in Nanzhang, 1,300 in
Xuan’en, 1,000 in Laifeng and 2,000 in Zhushan. Wage income alone (at RMB 10 per day) was
estimated at RMB 3 million for Nanzhang, RMB 4 million for Xuan’en, RMB 3 million for Najitan
and RMB 6 million for Zhushan. During the operational period, the five sub-projects altogether
created 181 employment opportunities.

(c) Other Benefits
10. Other benefits (beyond those considered as required for income restoration of resettlers) stem
from increased irrigation (due to conversion of land, upgrading of canals, reduced pumping costs,
increased reliability of flows etc), increased cage fishing, reduced flood damage, and reducing
municipal and industrial water supply costs. These benefits were estimated by the project counties at
the appraisal stage to bring some RMB 11.5 million for Nanzhang, RMB 1.07 million for Xuan’en,
RMB 2.34 million for Laifeng, and RMB 1.31 million for Zhushan. The Nanzhang benefits were
primarily related to flood control and the Guangrun benefits to flood control, water supply, and
irrigation.

3. TA study to enhance county poverty alleviation planning

(a) Scope of the TA study:

11. Finally, in addition to all the tangible benefits (described above) generated by the project in the
five project counties, the project was to finance consultant services to enhance county poverty
alleviation planning. Although the five project counties had made considerable strides towards
eliminating poverty over the 15 years preceding the commencement of project preparation, there
were still some weaknesses in poverty alleviation efforts, common to many poverty counties in China.
12. To improve county poverty reduction planning in China, the Central Government sponsored a
study in 2001 to develop a new methodology and prepare guidelines. The study team used a poverty
county in Hebei Province as a model to develop and demonstrate the planning process, and worked
closely with villages to prepare bottom-up poverty alleviation plans for several poverty villages,
based on which, a county level poverty alleviation plan was developed covering a five year time
frame. The new methodology consisted of five steps, as follows:
   1. Establishment of county poverty alleviation funds.
   2. Identification of county poverty villages (by developing specific indicators and ranking
      villages).
   3. Development of village-level poverty alleviation plans (using a participatory / bottom-up
      approach).
   4. Aggregation of village plans into county-level poverty reduction plans. From this, was to be
      developed a county poverty project list.
   5. Monitoring and supervision of the implementation of county poverty reduction plans.
13. At the time of project preparation (in 2001 and 2002), using this new methodology, Hubei
Province had started to prepare a few preliminary pilot village-level poverty alleviation plans in the
project counties.
14. The project was to finance consultant services to help establish the new methodology, enhance
the preliminary pilot village-level poverty alleviation plans in the project counties, and more
generally, improve current practice in poverty alleviation planning in the project counties, i.e. (from
the PAD):
      Improve the performance evaluation system and performance indicators (by developing more
       scientific indicators, more focused on measuring the direct benefits for rural farmers).
      Channel more investment in public goods development (basic infrastructure services such as
       road access to market, transportation services, market information, etc).
      To the extent possible, allocate more funding to rural households (through village groups) to
       allow them to finance their own initiatives.

(b) Results of the TA study:

15. County poverty alleviation funds had already been established for each of the five project
counties. The average annual funding (from the years 2000 to 2007) was about RMB 25 million for
each of the four nationally designated project poverty counties and about RMB 8 million for
Nanzhang (the only provincially designated project poverty county).
16. County poverty villages were identified and ranked by developing specific indicators. The set
of indicators was the same for all counties in Hubei, but their respective weights differed between
counties. They included the following eight indicators:

                                                  37
      Three livelihood indicators - cash (per capita income), grain (per capita production), and
       housing (size and quality indicators).
      Three infrastructure indicators - drinking water, electricity, and road access.
      Two social indicators - education (children in school and drop-out rate) and health (percent of
       women with disease).
17. Based on these indicators, in year 2002, poverty villages were identified and ranked by poverty
level in each county. A total of 422 villages (414,496 persons) were identified as poverty villages,
41% of the 1,023 villages in the four counties, as shown below:
                       Number of “poor? villages by county in 2002
                    Xuan’en       Laifeng     Nanzhang      Zhushan       TOTAL
                      141          122           26           133          422

18. Instead of first developing a series of village-level poverty alleviation plans, and then
aggregating them into a county-level poverty reduction plan, from which a county poverty project list
would be prepared, prioritized, and progressively implemented, in line with a decree issued by the
Hubei Provincial Government in 2002, project counties financed the poverty alleviation plans of a
fixed number of different villages each year (17 villages in Xuan’en, 15 in Laifeng, and 18 in
Zhushan), starting with the poorest villages (resulting from the preceding village poverty ranking
exercise). The goal was to address at least each of the 422 county poverty villages once by 2010 (an
eight to nine year period defining the number of different poverty villages supported each year by
county). This simplified the planning and administrative process at the county level, gave more
responsibility and pressure to poverty villages to make good use of the funds and of the planning
exercise, and increased the focus of villages and county poverty officials on the technical aspects of
the preparation and implementation of village-level poverty alleviation plans. This also improved the
quality of village-level poverty alleviation plans; counties were able to start with a few “pilot?
village-level plans, and draw lessons for other villages from a “learning by doing? exercise, for
which Bank financed consultants contributed their experience and their expertise.

Village level poverty alleviation plans
19. These plans were prepared using a bottom-up approach with full participation of village
members to identify the poorest people in the village, the basic causes of poverty and measures
likely to be effective in eliminating poverty. During the planning process, villagers had four basic
rights: the right to be informed of the planning content; the right to observe the planning process; the
right to speak and participate in the process; and the right to make planning decisions for their
villages. County and township officials worked closely with villagers to identify appropriate poverty
reduction activities based on actual conditions and available skills among villagers. Detailed cost
estimates and funding arrangements were developed based on projected available poverty alleviation
funding.

World Bank financed capacity building activities
20. The Bank-financed consultant services provided between 2002 and 2004 (delivering advisory
services, training programs, and workshops) contributed to improving the poverty alleviation
planning methodology of the project counties. In particular, the consultants:
      Helped introduce the eight poverty indicators (mentioned above) to identify and prioritize
       poverty villages, and ensured their consistent application in each county.
      Enhanced on a pilot basis the first village-level poverty alleviation plans by providing advice
       on their content and methodology. They finalized and tested a set of guidelines for
       developing village-level poverty alleviation plans. The village level plans were to comprise
       an analysis of: (a) economic opportunities for poor people to generate income (i.e. agriculture
       and rural industries); (b) economic infrastructure needs of the poor (rural roads, irrigation and
       soil conservation, drinking water facilities, rural electrification, and communication); and (c)
       access to social services (education, health, social protection) and its impact on poverty.
      Helped counties on a pilot basis with the monitoring and supervision of the implementation
       of village level poverty alleviation plans by: preparing procedures for monitoring
       implementation based on a participatory process; and preparing and delivering training
       programs to pilot villages on monitoring and evaluation, on both implementation monitoring
       and poverty implementation evaluation. Implementation monitoring included project
       implementation progress, fund allocation, number of participating households, quality of
       implemented projects and total output, reported to the affected population and counties in a
       poverty information booklet distributed every year.

(c) Socio-economic conditions of the counties after the project:

21. The socio-economic conditions of project counties have greatly improved between 2002 and
2011, as shown by the net annual rural per capita income (if urban areas were included, average net
annual per capita income would be much higher):

                    Net annual rural per capita income by county (in RMB)
               County / Year             2002                2007               2011
           Xuan’en                       1,458               2,109              3,739
           Laifeng                       1,466               2,153              3,713
           Zhushan                       1,656               2,395              3,726
           Nanzhang                      2,208               3,749              6,819
           Jianshi                       1,427               2,102              3,747
           Average                       1,643               2,502              4,349
           In USD per day                 0.54                0.91               1.83

22. As noted in Annex 5, rural areas in these counties have basically graduated from absolute
poverty and are now close to graduating from vulnerable poverty.
23. Most weaknesses identified in county poverty planning at the appraisal stage were addressed
by the TA study, as follows:
      Bank financed capacity building activities contributed to improving performance indicators
       and the poverty alleviation monitoring and evaluation system (as described above).


                                                   39
          More investment was channeled in public goods development. A mid-term survey in late
           2004 showed that 71 percent of village-level poverty alleviation funds were spent on
           enhancing access to basic infrastructure services (roads, drinking water, and electricity).
          To the extent possible, more funding was allocated to rural households (through village
           groups) to allow them to finance their own initiatives; about 10 to 20 percent of village-level
           poverty alleviation funds went to farmers and households for income generation activities.
24. Access to basic infrastructure services has improved substantially. In 2002, in these counties,
44% of village groups did not have access to all-weather roads; 31% of households did not have
access22 to drinking water; and 0.1% of village groups did not have access to electricity. In December
2011, the situation had improved as follows: 7% of village groups did not have access to all-weather
roads; 18% of households did not have access to drinking water; and less than 0.1% of village groups
did not have access to electricity.
25. Housing conditions, too, have improved. In 2002, in these counties, 1.3% of the population was
still living in precarious / insalubrious housing conditions. In 2011, the entire county population was
living in relatively good housing conditions (according to local standards in Hubei Province).

4. An example of poverty alleviation work: the Guangrun Community Benefit Development
Plan (CBDP) in Jianshi County (Guangrun sub-project)

26. In 2002, Jianshi County was listed as one of the 492 poorest counties in China. More than 95
percent of its population (52,000) lived in rural mountainous areas with sometimes limited access to
basic infrastructure services (road, drinking water, and electricity).
27. The US$388,000 advance payment on the carbon credits to be generated by the project funded
a part of the Community Benefit Development Plan (CBDP). The CBDP activities were regrouped
under six components as follows:

              Components                                               Activities
     1. Improving basic                    Road and drinking water access projects benefiting 11,042

28. A team of consultants hired by the Bank to evaluate implementation of the CBDP produced an
evaluation report: Results-Based Evaluation Report of the Guangrun Community Benefit
Development Plan (CBDP). The Bank concluded in 2008 that implementation of the CBDP was
highly satisfactory. The impressive progress achieved was partially due to the availability of funds
required and to the strong commitment of the local government and of the Guangrun Company. The
local government had made substantial counterpart fund contributions to the preparation and
implementation of the activities, which showed strong ownership of the CBDP.

Annex 10. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

From the ICR Summary submitted by Dongping:

1.    Project Construction. Construction started on March 15, 2002. River closure (Zhongjian
River) was achieved on October 14, 2002. The first and second units were put in commercial
operation on September 30, 2005 and on January 4, 2006. In June 2006, the main project was
completed. In December 2007, the units were supervised and accepted, and in August 2009, the
project passed the provincial acceptance.

2.     Project Operation. As the project legal entity, the Dongping Hydro Power Co. Ltd. was in
charge of project preparation, construction, and operation. Guided by the principle of “simplified and
efficient?, the company consists of four departments: the Secretariat, the Financial Department,
General Affairs, and the Production Department. From September 2007 onward, the company
adopted the “unmanned substation? operating method on the ground that the security and technical
measures had been well carried out. Viewed from the perspective of the operation of the equipment,
most of the full monitoring equipment has been functioning steadily since its set up. For the time
being, the dam uses the Nair DMS 4.0 System, which, since its automatic implementation in March
2007, has been operating steadily and has realized remote control and acquisition. Since the start of
power generation, the power plant has on one hand created good economic profit for the company,
and on the other hand has played an important role in the transmission system security, stability,
economic operation, peak power supply as well as supply during summer and winter peaks. The
generation units, from September 30, 2005 to August 2009, have cumulatively generated
885,619,820 million kWh, providing to the grid 869,708,670 kWh. The gross revenue reached
268.87 million Yuan.

3.     Resettlement. The resettlement work of the project, according to the original plan, employs
“resettle with land and develop agriculture? as the main form of resettlement, supplemented by non-
land resettlement. The dam site villagers were resettled by moving near their original homes or by
resettling in other villages in their township. The land acquisition and resettlement work of the
Dongping project started in February 2002 and was monitored by the East China Investigation and
Design Institute (ECIDI) under CHECC. In May 2006, ECIDI finished the Designated Report on the
Revision and Calculation of the Compensations for the Dongping Hydropower Project. In June 2006,
the Migration and Resettlement Office of Hubei Province and other related departments successfully
completed the acceptance check of the resettlement work. They opined that the conditions of
resettled villagers had been greatly improved, that most villagers had been appropriately positioned
both in life and in work, that the reconstruction of the specified programs had been almost finished,
that the resettlement work had been of good quality, that resettlement compensation records matched
with the actual resettlement work, that funds had been properly disbursed, that the filing system was
sound, and that the dam site had been properly cleaned up.

4.    Environmental Management. Categorized as a Category A project of the World Bank, the
Dongping Project followed the Environmental Management Plan of the Dongping Project issued by
Hubei Province. According to the County Report on the Conservation of Soil and Water and the
Construction of Ecological Environment (which Dongping Company also followed), the dam site
along with the resettlement areas are among the key supervision areas of the county. The
construction of the project, obeying the national environment laws in this respect, was evaluated in
accordance with the System of Environmental Effects. The corporation in charge of the construction
of the project was very responsible, bearing in mind the environmental protection from the very

                                                 46
beginning to the very end of the construction process. They strictly required the construction
company to implement those environmental laws in the bidding invitation, construction, and the
acceptance supervision of the project. Sound and comprehensive offices and rules were organized
and implemented respectively during construction. Departments in the fields of management,
construction, and project monitoring have all been conscientious about their own work, especially
about environmental protection issues: conservation of soil and water, handling of various kinds of
waste water, preventing or controlling air pollution, controlling noise levels, solid waste disposal,
compensation and recovery of arable land, preservation of wildlife, protection of human health,
environment monitoring. The orders and measures issued in the reports mentioned above were
carried out and brought pollution under control. No major environmental / pollution issue occurred
during construction, and no environmental complaints were received. Measures were adopted to
minimize the use of arable land, using instead non-arable land to the extent possible. The living
conditions of resettled villagers, including their housing conditions, water supply, power supply as
well as transportation, have been greatly improved. The majority of the resettled villagers are content.
The plans in the environmental protection reports have been implemented well and have achieved
satisfying results.

From the ICR Summary submitted by Songshuling:

8.     The Songshuling Hydropower Project started on June 1, 2002. River diversion was completed
on January 8, 2003. Generator No. 1 started generating electricity on September 29, 2005. Generator
No. 2 started sending power to the State Power Grid on December 10, 2005. On January 2, 2006,
Generator No. 3 started sending power to the State Power Grid and the last generator was connected
to the grid on January 24, 2006. In July 2005, the dam passed the check and acceptance procedure of
the National Research Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower. In August, 2005, the
construction work of the hydropower station passed the check and acceptance procedure of the Water
Resources Bureau. In August 2005, the Shiyan Resettlement Bureau finished supervising the
resettlement program for residents in the reservoir area. The next month, the water reservoir project
passed the acceptance procedure of the Hubei Development and Reform Commission. The whole
project successfully met the appraisal requirements of the National Research Institute of Water
Resources and Hydropower in January 2007. The overall investment for the project is RMB 355
million. The project was managed by Guodian Changyuan Duhe Hydroelectric Power Development
Company Limited which is one of the key corporations in Zhushan County. It has been appraised as
one of the ten best taxpaying companies in Zhushan County in five years in a row, and has been
credited by Zhushan County as one of the ten best companies in Zhushan.

9.     Formation of Mother Company: Guodian Changyuan Duhe Hydroelectric Power
Development Company Limited. It was founded in 2001 at the Commerce and Industry Bureau of
Zhushan County. On November 5, 2001, Zhushan Hydropower Development Company and Hubei
Local Hydropower Development Company held a meeting after which the two companies offered
81.7 million Yuan to form Hubei Zhushan Duhe Hydroelectric Power Development Company Ltd.
As the legal entity for the Songshuling Hydroelectric Power Station, it is responsible for preparing
the construction work for the project. Also, the corporation is in charge of running the project and
pay back loans for the project. Zhushan Hydropower Development Company offered 60 percent of
the overall capital of the corporation; the rest was offered by Hubei Local Hydropower Development
Company. On November 8, 2001, the corporation registered at the Commerce and Industry Bureau of
Zhushan County. On March 5, 2003, the company decided to adjust its capital to 71 million Yuan
after the conference. Hubei Changyuan Electricity Power Company Ltd offered 42.60 million Yuan
which accounts for 60 percent of all shares; Hubei Local Hydropower Development Company and
Zhushan Hydropower Development Company each offered 14.2 million Yuan, which accounts for 40
percent of all shares. In May 2005, Hubei Local Hydropower Development Company and Zhushan
Hydropower Development Company transferred their shares to Hubei Min Yuan Electricity Power
Company Ltd and Shi Yan Ju Hong Corporation. Shares owned by Hubei Changyuan Electricity
Power Company Ltd remained unchanged, Hubei Min Yuan Electricity Power Company Ltd offered
23.43 million Yuan which accounts for 33% of all shares and the rest 7 percent of all shares was
owned by Shi Yan Ju Hong Corporation. The share of Hubei Minyuan and Electric Power Company
Ltd and Shi Yan Ju Hong Corporation was bought by Hubei Jing Neng Long Bei Wan Hydropower
Electricity Development Company Ltd. Then the corporation was renamed China Guodian
Changyuan Duhe Hydroelectric Power Development Company Limited. Hubei Changyuan
Electricity Power Company Ltd now holds 60% of all shares and the rest of the shares are owned by
Hubei Jing Neng Long Bei Wan Hydropower Electricity Development Company Ltd.

10. Resettlement Work. The “Resettlement Plan of the Songshuling Project? was proposed by the
Resettlement Bureau of Zhushan County and the HydroChina Huadong Engineering Corporation.
The resettlement was done by resettling people who used to live in the reservoir to other locations or
resettling them near the hydropower station. The resettlement guaranteed all resettled families

                                                 48
sufficient farmland to live. It turned out that resettled families are satisfied by the resettlement work.
In fact, resettled families now live a much better life after the resettlement work. Their new houses
are built with brick and wood with an average living area of 40.8 square meters, increasing by 58%
after the resettlement work. Each resettled family got 3,600 Yuan per person compensation for loss
of farmland and 1,500 Yuan per family compensation for income loss coming from wood sale, 450
Yuan per acreage compensation for income loss coming from food sales. Resettled people got 1.4 mu
of farmland per person. For those who resettled near the power plant, in addition to the above
compensations, each person got on average an additional 1.4 mu of farmland. Other benefits include:
ensuring water sanitation, developing industry with domestic features, and repairing road to resettled
villages. The project fixed Zhu Xiang Road for 12 million Yuan, 50 percent more than originally
planned. Zhu Xiang Road was upgraded after evaluation. Liang Xin Road was repaired in May 2005,
costing 1.57 million Yuan.

11. Environmental Protection. World Bank experts were satisfied with the environmental
protection work done under the project. The Environmental Monitoring Center of Zhushan County
monitored the environmental quality during construction and trial operation. The project exerts no
serious impact on environment. In May 2008, the Hubei Provincial Water Resources Bureau
published: the “Assessment of Soil and Water Protection Instruments of the Songshuling Project? in
the Insurance Journal of the Hubei Hydropower Electricity Office (Year 2008). The conclusion of the
assessment is that the Songshuling Project made a great effort to preserve water and soil resources. It
ensured a good recovery of water and soil resources in the region. All built soil and water reservation
instruments met national standards and industry criteria, and reached the requirements of the
approved “water and soil reservation plan?. The quality of water and soil preservation is up to
specifications. The assessment group approved the soil and water preservation work done by the
Songshuling Hydroelectric Power Station. In 2008, the Hubei Environmental Protection Bureau
approved the finished environmental protection project in “Document No. 3, Hubei Environmental
Assessment (Year 2008)?. The main conclusions are as follows: the construction team has done a
good job in designing, constructing, and using the environmental protection project along with the
main engineering project of the hydropower station. They have implemented the environmental
protection methods which they proposed in the environmental assessment documents. Pollution
prevention efforts and environmental protection measures have proved to be effective in the
construction process and trial operation period. The water quality after the construction work has met
environmental requirements. The soil and water preservation project is mainly done by taking
engineering protection measures and planting vegetation in the affected areas; and these methods
have proved effective in preventing soil and water resources loss. The project met the requirements
of the Hubei Provincial Water Resources Bureau and Environment Protection Bureau and passed the
acceptance test.

12. Poverty Alleviation Work. Research on poverty alleviation was done by the Rural
Development Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. They offered suggestions from the
“National Rural Poverty Reduction and Development Program (2001-2010)?. The project helped
relieve from poverty 18 impoverished villages each year and improve the living standards of all
impoverished villagers in the area for a few years.

13. Annual Power Generation. Because of droughts, the annual power production did not meet
the maximum design capacity. Until the end of Year 2010, the power station has produced up to
478.73 GWh of electricity. The annual electricity production is shown in the following table (Annual
Power Production from Year 2005 to 2010, in GWh):


                                                   49
      Year               2005       2006      2007       2008      2009       2010     Total
      Power              20.20      58.44     97.99      92.09    105.53     104.48    478.73
      Production

14. Lessons Learned. First, constructing a power station is subject to the influence of national
macro-policy and local government support. To make the project run smoothly, the project should be
in accordance with domestic economic development policies. The power station was able to develop
well only when it was seen as a key element for the economic development of Zhushan County.
Zhushan County has been working on developing the local economy by taking advantage of
abundant local water resources and by developing the electricity industry. Zhushan County
Government has been pursuing a policy of industrialization and urbanization, and of harmonization
of income levels between rural and urban residents. It has been favoring the development of
hydropower resources to industrialize the local economy and protect the environment. This was a
good environment for developing a hydroelectric power station.

15. Secondly, the juridical person, which is the center of the “modern enterprise system?,
guaranteed the project to run smoothly. The juridical person system has pinpointed the major
principle of the enterprise and ensures there will be people with the right responsibilities to handle
problems as they occur.

16. Thirdly, the cost plan should combine the approved cost plan and the foreign investment
utilization plan. The cost plan should include the cost of getting foreign investment such as the
promissory fee and the subscription fee to limit the cost of the project.

17. Fourthly, it took a lot of work to comfort and compensate resettled farmers. Making use of
small communities, consigning the local government with the responsibility of resettlement and
entrusting the owner of the resettlement community and outside supervisor to monitor the
resettlement process on a regular basis have proved successful. This could be beneficial to other
resettlement plans.

From the ICR Summary submitted by Xiakou:

18. Xiakou Hydropower Project is a project financed by the World Bank, which started
construction in August 2002. During the construction process, all parties involved and the World
Bank paid much attention to safety and quality.

19. Resettlement. The resettlement involved three villages (Tongchenghe, Ganhe, and Xiakou)
and eight groups of villagers. The resettlement work started in 2002, along with the land acquisition
and house demolition, and was completed in April 2006. As required by the World Bank, the
resettlement situation was monitored and evaluated continuously. Between December 6 to 12, 2005,
the Xiangfan City Government organized a joint onsite inspection and assessment and issued the
overall acceptance. Participating agencies included: the Municipal Land Resources Bureau, the
Municipal Water Conservancy Bureau, the Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, the
Municipal Resettlement Bureau, and other relevant departments. Under the guidance of the leading
group and the resettlement supervision, all the 232 resettled households were provided with drinking
water that meets health requirements. During construction, health and disease prevention in the
resettlement area was carried out by the Nanzhang Center for Disease Control. During the relocation

                                                 50
process, health habits of most resettled people have gradually improved. All 232 resettled households
now have permanent flush toilets. They also have tap water or drinking water that meets health
requirements. The housing area of new homes increased and the sanitation and environmental
conditions improved.

20. Environmental Management. The Xiakou project was categorized by the World Bank as a
Category A project, which requires stronger environmental protection. According to World Bank
environmental assessment requirements (Policy 4.01), in April 2002, an “Environmental
Management Plan? (EMP) was prepared, and served as a guide for environmental management
during implementation. The Environmental Management Office of the company was established at
the start of construction. The Environmental Management Office was to conduct the environmental
management, supervision, and coordination of all of the contractors and institutions in the
construction area to ensure the implementation of environmental protection measures. An
“Environmental Management Report? and an “Environmental Progress Report? were compiled
regularly to monitor and supervise environmental aspects during the construction and operation
stages. The Environmental Supervision Unit started in August 2002 when the project environmental
management system was introduced. The environmental monitoring station of Nanzhang County was
commissioned to carry out the environmental monitoring work from August 2002 to October 2007,
covering: water quality, air quality, noise, water and other indicators during the construction and
operation phases. 17 environmental monitoring reports and 1 report on drinking water testing were
produced, and the monitoring results show that all indicators were in line with requirements.
Construction and trial operation of environmental management agencies during operation showed
that the environmental management of the construction area was satisfactory. The environmental
protection work was supported by the World Bank inspection team and international consultants.
Environmental management agencies at all levels earnestly fulfilled their duties. There was no
environmental accident in the construction area. Environmental supervisors, contractors, EMS staff
reports reflected their work on environment in time, and people were satisfied with this. On February
22, 2010, the Hubei Provincial Environmental Protection Department inspected the environmental
protection work of the Xiakou project, and the environmental acceptance was issued, which means
that the permit for project operation was granted!

21. Poverty Alleviation. According to the agreement signed on January 21, 2003 between the
World Bank and the County Electric Power Company, at the end of 2005, the County Financial
Bureau approved the establishment of the poverty alleviation fund for the Xiakou project, which was
carried out as follows:
 Establishment of a special account for the Nanzhang poverty alleviation fund. The County
    Financial Bureau, according to the stipulated percentage, deposited every year the ear-marked
    fund into the special account, and could then supplement the county poverty alleviation work.
 The Xiakou poverty alleviation fund is expected to be available until the end of 2011. In 2006,
    due to the short operation of the power plant, the poverty alleviation fund was combined with
    year 2007.
 Strict regulation of the nature and use of the fund. The County Financial Bureau and the County
    Poverty Alleviation Office, on the basis of Document No. 98 County Finance [2006], formulated
    and issued the “Nanzhang poverty alleviation fund management approach?. It clearly defined that
    the nature and the use of the poverty alleviation fund is to give priority to poverty alleviation
    projects in poor areas and to cover the expenses of the county poverty monitoring work, such as
    outstanding poverty alleviation projects, infrastructure, labor training, and skills transfer. The



                                                 51
    disbursement of the fund was in accordance with related regulations on financial program
    management.
   Clarification of the functions of related departments. County departments were responsible for
    project review and acceptance and submission for approval to the poverty alleviation leading
    group. The County Finance Bureau was responsible for monitoring and allocation of the fund.
    The poverty alleviation fund received public supervision and was included in the agenda of the
    local government.

22. Financial Management. The Hubei Provincial Audit Department commissioned the Xiangfan
City Audit Office to audit the project company. An audit was carried out once a year since the start
of project construction and audit reports are available. The final audit at project completion was
conducted by the Daxin Certified Public Accounting Firm of Hubei Province. The project is in strict
accordance with “SASAC accounting norms for investment companies in Hubei Province? and with
the “Accounting Methods for Electric Power Companies in Hubei?. The total investment (283.13
million yuan) and the unit investment (9,000 yuan/kW) are all reasonable. The current average unit
investment for hydropower projects in Hubei is about 10,000 yuan/kW.

23. Acceptance Procedure. According to the “Acceptance of Water Resources and Hydropower
Construction Projects (SL223-2008)? requirements, all project completion acceptance procedures
were completed by February 2010.

From the ICR Summary submitted by Guangrun:

24. The Guangrun project was launched in 2005. Hongwawu reservoir impoundment took place on
August 20, 2010. The two powerhouses at Hongwawu were commissioned on September 28, 2009
and on November 23, 2010. Zhamushui officially started in August 2008 and is currently under
construction. The project is expected to be completed in June 2012. Hongwawu has a total reservoir
capacity of 4.98 million cubic meters, two powerhouses of 8 MW and 10 MW; Zhamushui has a total
reservoir capacity of 20 million cubic meters, with a future installed power capacity of 10 MW. The
project will have a total installed capacity of 28 MW, and an annual design power generation
capacity of 92.7 GWh. The Guangrun project is an integrated water resources and hydropower
project with multipurpose benefits: power generation, urban water supply, flood control, irrigation,
tourism, and aquaculture.

25. Project Budget. In 2005, the Hubei Provincial Development and Reform Commission
approved the project feasibility study report with an estimated investment of 266.7 million yuan:
159.4 million yuan for Hongwawu and 107.4 million yuan for Zhamushui. Because of the extension
of the project construction, unexpected geological conditions, rising prices, bank interest rates and
resettlement policy adjustment, the project investment is expected to reach 390 million yuan.

26. Project Company. On March 21, 2005, Jianshi Guangrun Power Development Company
Limited was formed in Hubei Province with capital contributions from: Hubei Guoxin Investment
Company Ltd (55%), Enshi Prefecture Power Company (5%), and Jianshi County Power Company
(40%). The registered capital was 66 million yuan. Under the leadership of the Board of Directors,
the company was managed by a general manager and comprised of four departments: a general
department, a financial department, an engineering department, and a resettlement & environmental
protection department. On May 11, 2010, Guodian Hubei Hydropower Development Company Ltd
(owned by China Guodian Company) acquired all the shares held by Hubei Guoxin Investment


                                                 52
Company Ltd (55%), the project company’s controlling shareholder. The registered capital was still
66 million yuan and the ownership structure of the two other shareholders remained unchanged. On
July 6, 2010 the company changed its name to Guodian Guangrun Hydro Power Development
Company Limited. In October 2010, the company senior management personnel and institutional
adjustment was completed. The general manager is Mr. Shao Minghua. The company comprises of
four departments: a general department (including resettlement and environmental protection), a
financial department, a production safety department, and a project management department.

27. Resettlement. The preparatory work of the land acquisition and resettlement was officially
launched in October 2005. In April 2006, on the basis of the World Bank “Resettlement Action Plan?,
the Guangrun Company and the Jianshi County People’s Government signed the “Guangrun land
acquisition and immigration agreement?, defining the roles and duties of the two parties for the
resettlement work. The Jianshi County People’s Government established a county leading group for
the project as well as a county resettlement office with full-time staff, with experience in resettlement.
Hongwawu reservoir’s land acquisition and resettlement work was completed on July 31, 2010 and
successfully passed the resettlement acceptance procedure, needed for reservoir impoundment.
Zhamushui reservoir land acquisition and resettlement: resettlement compensation rates were revised
to take into account price increases and national resettlement policy adjustments to improve
compensation standards. The resettlement work is planned to be completed by the end of April 2012.

28. Environment. The environmental protection work of the Guangrun project was undertaken by
four agencies: the environmental management agency (the project owner), the oversight agency
(Wuhan Huayuan Environmental Protection Technology Company), the monitoring agency (Jianshi
County Environmental Protection Bureau), and the implementing agency (contractors). The
environmental protection work ensured: (1) the serious implementation of the Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) during the construction and operation phases of the Guangrun project; (2)
the gradual restoration of Hongwawu’s site: the quality of the water in Hongwawu’s reservoir area,
downstream of the dam, and at the two powerhouses; (3) the implementation of environmental
measures at Zhamushui: pollution reduction measures, spoil disposal measures, special measures
near the drinking water source to ensure the security of urban water supply, etc.

29. Poverty Alleviation Work. In accordance with the relevant requirements of the Carbon Fund
Agreement, the World Bank prepaid US$388,000 for the poverty alleviation work of the Guangrun
project. The local government also provided financial support. All relevant units participated in the
Guangrun Carbon Fund Community Development Project Team implemented under the auspices of
the county project office. The following projects were implemented in Yezhou Township: 6 new road
projects, 5 drinking water supply projects, 3 education and health projects, 2 technical training
projects, 1 business development project – a total of 17 projects. They passed the acceptance
procedure and were implemented in accordance with the project design and related construction
standards. The Guangrun Carbon Fund Community Development Project benefited a population of
over 15,000 people, accounting for 15 percent of the township population, in 9 villages: Longmen,
Shanmu, Jigongling, Hongtuping, Chayuangou, Tianjiaping, Qiliping, Dangyangba, and Qishuya. In
Gaoping, an ethnic minority cultural museum was built and now plays a positive role in promoting
local tourism and cultural folklore.

30. Power Generation. The generating capacity in 2009 was: 0.69 GWh, in 2010: 11.43 GWh, in
2011: 11.8 GWh – a cumulative generating capacity of 23.92 GWh. The tariff approved by the Hubei
Provincial Pricing Bureau in December 2009 is 0.36 yuan / kWh.
