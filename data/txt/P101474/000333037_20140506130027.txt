                                            EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Description of the proposed project

This Resettlement action plan is prepared as part of the planning process of the city
administration of Desssie to construct 2 KMs with30mtr width gravel road stretching from salyish
to Segno Gebyea that crosses two kebles,Kebele 01&02.Salaysh-Segno Gebeya Road Project
is an ULGDP project in Desie city envisaged to upgrade the existing 10 meters wide sub-
standard road to a 30 meters wide all weather asphalt road. The construction activities include
the construction of camp site,

Impact of the Project:
Acquisition of land and housing structures
The proposed road construction project requires the acquisition of land and removal of
structures mainly houses both private and keble owned kiosks and trees. Thus, the
implementation of the project needs the demolition of 221 houses, kiosks trees & public
infrastructures. Thus, as a result of the implementation of the proposed project 221 houses,
kiosks, public infrastructures and 746 trees will be completely demolished.

Project affected people

According to the data collected from affected households in the project area, a total of 229
households including “ Debal?1 (there are 16 household heads that are living in 8 houses as
debals) will be affected. In addition two government offices owned by Ethio-Tele-Com Company
and Desie Zuria Woreda administration will be affected by the project. Thus, a total population
of 1251 individuals across the two Kebels will be affected due to the implementation of the
proposed gravel road project
 The total estimated values of assets that will be lost due to the implementation of the project
have been estimated by the valuation committee: The committee estimated 11,055,296.45 Birr
for Houses/Structures, 23,660.00 Birr for Trees, 350,000.00 Birr for Tele communication line
poles, 27,443.40 Birr for Electric line poles, 27,970.10 Birr for Electric Transformer and 450,000
Birr is for the three months temporary house rent expenses for residence .For business
operators(21hhs) their structure will not be demolished until they completed the construction in
the new place. In addition the RAP includes 452,000.00 birr to construct 74 new kebele houses
and to cover other relocation costs. Thus, the total cost to implement this resettlement action
plan is Birr 13,010,937.90.

The socio-economic survey result shows that out of the total 229 households 84 households are
female headed and 62 households are headed by elderly people with age of above 64 years.
Out of the total project affected population about 11 percent were illiterate which is 15 percent

for female and 8 percent for male indicating the existence of gender disparity in education. In
general the education level of majority of the Project affected population is Secondary School
level accounting 42 percent of the population followed by Primary School which has 25 percent
share.

 Number of Income Earner Household Members varies among the households ranging from
zero to eight people per family. Majority of the income earner people are business persons with
share of 30 percent followed by government employee, day laborer, and retired with
corresponding shares of 25%, 12% and 9% in respective order. Day laborers and retired people
who have the lowest income and more vulnerable to economic shocks relative to others account
12 and 9 percent of the income earning people respectively.
Despite the possible loss of personal properties project affected people who participated in the
consultation meetings expressed their full support f or the development. However, t he y
r a is ed t he following concer ns :
            a. How compensation for project targeted properties will be determined
                 and paid?
            b. When and how their houses will be demolished?
            c. Where and how they will stay until their houses erected in new residential
               area
            d. Where and how the kebele tenants will get another house?

In responding to their concerns the city administration assures that each PAPs resettlement will
be treated as per RPF. Thus, compensation will be provided based on current market price at
replacement cost. In addition the city administration also agreed to provide 171 sqm land (a
minimum standard land size in Dessie) to construct houses in the new site.
For kebele tenants the city administration arranged a replacement house by classifying tenants
in to two categories. For those old and disabled the city administration identified a vacant
replacement house in the old residential area. For the rest the city administration agreed to
construct new house in a place that has been chosen in consultation with PAPs. In addition for
those living as “Debal? the city administration agreed to provide separate house for each Debal
in the new residential area.

For PAPs(both tenants& private land holders) who used their structure for business and
residence the city administration agreed to provide a working place (market shade) of
2.20mx3.75m at Segno Gebeya. In addition the city Administration will provide a standard land
to private land holders to construct their residence house. Since the majority of PAPs land
holding in the project area is smaller than the current standard of the city administration all will
have a replacement land of as per minimum standard which is 171sqm.
For tenants who use the structure for residence only the city administration will have construct
74 new houses in the selected sites of keble 01 and 02. The houses will be constructed in
24sqm area and each house will have 2 rooms. For private land holders (21 hhs) who use their

structure for business only the city administration has to give standard size of land along the
road side in both kebles.
For those who have container kiosks the city administration prepared land to install their
container along the road side of both kebles(01&02).

The new residential site (tenants and private owners) selected for PAPs resettlement is located
near to the existing residential area (0.5Km away). It has been selected with full participation of
PAPs. The PAPs expressed their willingness to resettle in the mentioned site because the site is
near to the old residential area and it has all infrastructures (water, electricity feeder road etc). In
addition since it is not far from the existing residence PAPs can access social services (Health,
School and other services) without additional cost of transport and other cost and their social
network such as Idir equib and other formal and informal networks will not be affected.

After reviewing the compensation method and rate and other assistances PAPs
expressed their approval and agreement with their signature. A record of the
consultations made along with names and telephone numbers (where available) and
summarized minutes of the meetings are appended to the study report duly
supported by photographs.
Public consultation
The city administration together with the consulting firm undertook over six community
consultations. In addition stakeholder workshops and meetings were conducted with
representatives from Dessie Woreda Kebele administration offices and project affected people.
The entitlement application were disseminated and discussed across all Kebeles affected by the
project. The cut-off date for determining beneficiaries was established, which was the date the
baseline survey was completed September 24/2012 and it has been communicated to the
PAPs.
Vulnerable social Groups: though the entire community along the row of the proposed project
faces the adverse impact of the project some social groups are more vulnerable relative to
others due to cultural, social, and economic factors. Vulnerable social groups in the context of
the project area are poor female-headed households & elderly and disable households. These
people need special attention during resettlement process. By understanding this fact the city
administration gave special emphasis for these PAPs during resettlement. For example the city
administration has prepared a replacement house in the old residential area for the identified
vulnerable households of kebele tenants.

The mitigation recommendations presented in this report are developed based on the need
to address fairly and equitably concerns raised by project affected people, which includes
monetary compensation for loss of physical assets,          moving expenses, provision of
housing for kebele housing tenants and working places for kiosks and other keble tenants and
private land holders who use the house for both purposes.

The size of e a c h property was physically measured with the presence of the property
owners or their family members. The asset valuation and monetary worth estimates of the
properties calculated based on the replacement cost of the properties as suggested by the
Amhara Regional Government Guideline. As kiosks are easily moveable to the new area
, only mobilization and installation costs are considered to be given for them. The total
entitlements for project affected people including moving allowance and temporary rent fee is
Birr 13,010,937.90.The agreement was verified with signatures and the meeting was video
tapped for documentation.

The kebele 01 and 02 administrations jointly worked and prepared the required land for
construction of houses for project affected private owners and tenants. Currently, the two
kebels land management technicians are jointly working to prepare site plans for the new
residential area for tenants and private land holders and business areas for private holders.
The selected area for the resettlement is the vacant land occupied by the municipality and
since it is near to the existing area PAPs and other community members in the new
residential area have different formal and informal networks. Thus, there is no identified party
that can be considered as a host and there is no need to consult the host community.

However the whole community including PAPs was consulted during project identification
and RAP preparation period.

Disclosure and communication strategy:                         The entitlements applicable were
disseminated and discussed across all project affected people. PAPs have expressed
their approval with signatures.

A grievance redressed committee has been formed to address grievances related with
compensation and other assistances. PAPs have been chosen two representatives who serve
as a grievance member. The detail grievance procedure and the list of grievance committee will
be presented latter in this document.

1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background
With financial support from World Bank Dessie City administration planned to construct the
Salaysh-Segno Gebeya gravel road.

Ethiopia’s emphasis on expanded investment in road has benefited urban and rural
development in recent years. The Ministry of Works and Urban Development (MWUD) with
the support of the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA) developed the
Urban Local Government Development Project (ULGDP), which was formally launched in
September 2008. The ULGDP is a continuation of a program of reform by the Government of



                  Resettlement Action Plan for Salayish- Segno Gebeya gravel Road Project       Page 15
Dessie City Services Office                          Amhara Design and Supervision works Enterprise


Ethiopia that started with the government’s creation of a new institutional and organizational
framework for Urban Local Governments.

The International Development Association of the World Bank provides financing for the
ULGDP in which the Urban Local Governments (ULGs) and Regional Governments also
Participate and provide funds to finance capital investment of ULGDP.

As clearly defined by the Resettlement Framework (RPF) of the ULGDP document, the
project is going to be carried out with socially acceptable and environmentally sustainable
way with proper consideration of all affected parties. To effectively mitigate the involuntary
resettlement this RAP is carried out. The RAP enables to identify the number of local
residents affected by the project, the nature and degree of impact on them, measures to
minimize the adverse effects, and compensation and other assistance to be delivered to
affected people for unavoidable impacts to restore their livelihood.

The predicted social impacts from the road project include the relocation of households and
dwellings and other buildings within the row, business disturbance and generally the social
fabric of the community.

1.2 Profile of Project Area/Dessie


Dessie is one of the oldest cities in the country and the capital city of South Wollo Zone in the
Amhara National Regional State. It is located on the Addis Ababa - Mekelle highway, at
about 400 km distance from Addis Ababa, in the northern part of the country. The total
population of Dessie town is estimated at about 174,705.The sex composition shows that the
male population constitutes 84,224(48.21) and the female counterpart is 90,481(51.79).

Dessie City, wherein Salaysh-Segno Gebeya Road Project is proposed, is one of the 19
cities that have been selected from Ethiopia for ULGDP project. The city was selected for two
main reasons: a) it is important to focus on large sized investments so that substantial impact
can be achieved – so as to avoid a large number of small investments that have little real
impact; and b) to focus the ULGDP investment in those 18 cities that have already received
substantial capacity building support through the CBDSD project, including development of 5
year capital investment plans, plus the capital city, Addis Ababa.

The existing road is very narrow and damaged due to long age and luck of maintenance and
it has its own limitations to the town and the transport service including taxi transport service,
ambulance service and goods and commodity transportation. Therefore, communities are
faced with difficulties to visit health centre, market and other services in time. Hence, the
road will have high social and economic advantage to the Dessie town and the surrounding
woredas especially to “west woredas? that have high agricultural production potential and
delivers to the Dessie town dwellers. The proposed road is all weather gravel road with

30meter width and 2K.m length which is envisaged to be developed by upgrading the existing
road.

1.3 Objective and Scope of the Resettlement Action Plan
The general objective of the RAP for Dessie City Gravel Road Construction project is to
identify the likelihood of social impacts of the proposed p r o j e c t on residents i n the

                  Resettlement Action Plan for Salayish- Segno Gebeya gravel Road Project       Page 18

project site area and to suggest actions to mitigate the negative impacts associated with
the development

1.4 Specific Objectives of the RAP:
 To come up with clearly defined steps and actions to be taken by the City
    administration in response to adverse impacts of the intended project on social
    and economic lives of the project affected people based on the ULGDP
    resettlement policy frameworks, the country’s laws and The World Bank’s
    safeguard policy and standards and in consultation with the project affected
    peoples;
 To design appropriate strategies for restoration and improvement of the income
    and livelihood of the Project Affected People , special support measures for
    vulnerable groups, social service delivery and community based infrastructure
    development plan in new residential area;
 To determine task assignments, resource allocation(budgeting) and
    implementation schedules for measures against adverse impacts of the project;
 To determine documentation and reporting mechanisms among all the corned
    core processes (departments), staff and stakeholders involved in the
    implementation of the Resettlement Action Plan;
 To prepare documented mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation of progress
    and performance in implementation of Resettlement Action Plan itself.




1.5 Constraints to the Study
Key constraints experienced in preparation of the RAP were:

       Around 1 % of PAPs were not available during the first phase house-to-house
        Survey; as a result second phase house to house survey was arranged to
        reach those missed ones

       Project affected people get difficulty to provide clear and full information; and

       Condensed houses of the households made the house-to-house Survey
        complicated and difficult. However the consultant managed to cover all
        households through two phase household survey.

                   2 POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT

2.1 Positive Impacts
Economic development of the city and region as a whole is the long-term objective
and is associated with improved road accessibility. Key positive impacts or desired
outcomes expected from the project are explained below.

It is envisaged that the local economy will get stimulated due to the improvement of
the road access. The road project will connect the city and surrounding woredas
especially “west Woredas?. It's obvious that road in many instance will o pen up new
market opportunity. Hence, there will be opportunities to improve trade and
commerce in Dessie city; that will contribute to improve development at local and
regional level.

The project is also expected to provide Job opportunity for skilled and unskilled
labour for local people; the creation of temporary job during construction can be
considered as positive impact to the local people. Further, indirect employment
opportunities will be created for those people engaged in small businesses that
provide services to construction workers including sale of food and beverages will be
created. In the long term, improved road conditions provide increased access to
social services, markets and can improve the overall employment situation. The
implication of all of these is to increase income for local communities.

Hopefully, the transport access will be improved with shorter travel time, and/or
reduced traffic congestion along the road. The improvement in the road access will
facilitate access to markets, investment, industry, better health, education and other
social services. In the long run, this will contribute to the betterment of the living
standard of the community.

2.2 Adverse Impacts.
The loss of land-holding and privately owned assets, including productive resources (such as
trees) and structures on the land; the loss of public service facilities ; temporary impacts on


                  Resettlement Action Plan for Salayish- Segno Gebeya gravel Road Project       Page 21
Dessie City Services Office                          Amhara Design and Supervision works Enterprise


the subsistence/ livelihoods and income-earning capacity of those affected people; changes
in traffic movement patterns which results traffic congestion and transportation delay during
construction period; are potential adverse impacts of the project. In addition, there may be
waste discharge resulting from the construction that will affect community health unless
otherwise properly managed.

During construction phase there could be some nuisance noise generated by operation of
construction equipment, movement of vehicles and other machineries. In addition, dust
pollution caused by frequent movement of construction vehicles and other construction
equipments may occur. Furthermore, exhaust fumes or emissions released by diesel
operating equipment may cause some localized air pollution. During construction period it
may cause aggravation of water and wind erosion as it is characterized by steep slope nature
(hilly and rolling area). Land erosion on the potential quarry sites might be significant. The
city administration has prepared an Environment and Social impact assessment study (ESIA)
and Environment management plan (EMP) to overcome the mentioned and other
environmental impacts during construction and operational time. For details please refer the
ESIA study conducted for the project.

2.3   Vulnerable Groups
Though all the PAPs are affected by the project there are PAPs who are more vulnerable.
The socio-economic survey and subsequent analysis indicates that there are social groups
who are particularly vulnerable and are at greater risk of further impoverishment because of
project-induced changes due to lack or resources, social exclusion, disability, inability to
adapt, cultural influences and some other reasons.

The vulnerable social groups are female-headed, elderly-headed, disabled and the poorest
households. The elderly-household heads are those who are aged above 64 years hence
economically inactive due to old age; old people are not only Venerable, due to their age, but
also vulnerable, due to economic dependency. These vulnerable social groups need special
treatment in the resettlement process to restore their livelihood.


3 APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY

The Resettlement Action Plan has been prepared to ensure that action will be taken to
minimize damage or loss to properties of the project affected people. RAP is the instrument
that would help the city administration in restoration and reintegration of affected people. Its
objectives are to mitigate all physical, social, psychological and economic impacts, temporary
or permanent loss of assets or access to social services and facilities that may be
experienced by the project affected people. To this end, the following steps were followed
while preparing this RAP:

Dessie City Services Office                          Amhara Design and Supervision works Enterprise


        Undertaking a review of the relevant national and international policy, legal,
         and institutional frameworks and guidelines pertaining to involuntary
         resettlement, land acquisition, expropriation and compensation;

 Quantitative and qualitative data is collected from different sources. Primary data is
collected through household survey, an asset inventory census of affected households,
community discussion, key informant interview, and stake holder consultation. In addition
direct observation during field visit and the firsthand data obtained from the engineering
design document of the project were the primary data sources. Site visits and field surveys
were done in two phases from Figure 3 Field survey

From December 7, 2011 up to December 28, 2011 and from September 16, 2012 up to
September 24, 2012.

On the other hand, secondary data is gathered from governmental sector offices, as




well as from city and kebele administrative offices. Socio-economic secondary data of
Desie city in relation to land issues, such as land distribution, allocation and usage,
and experience on other projects was also utilized.

3.2 Key Informant Interview, Community Meeting, and Household
      Survey
In order to obtain supplementary information on socio-economic and socio-cultural
conditions, and views on various aspects of the impact of the project and in particular to
identify areas of specific concern that needed to be addressed key informant interview was
made for purposively selected individuals. The interviews were made for various
stakeholders of the road project including local authorities, and experts who have knowledge
about the Project context.

Community Meetings were held with project affected persons to involve their participation in
the planning and subsequent implementation processes. Over six community meetings were
conducted in each Kebeles affected by the Project. Workshops and meetings were
conducted with representatives from Dessie Woreda and Kebele administration offices. The
entitlement application were disseminated and discussed across all Kebeles affected by the
project.

A socio-economic survey was carried out on the entire (100%) affected households in
two phases, from December 7, 2011 up to December 28, 2011 and from September
16, 2012 up to September 24, 2012. Information on current infrastructure and social
service provision of the host and resettles community was obtained from relevant
local government authorities. The Asset Valuation Team confirmed infrastructure
affected by the Project. Triangulation of household survey, focus group discussion
and key and informant interview together with the secondary data is expected to
illustrate the real image of the socio-economic situation serving as an important input
for the preparation of action plan of the resettlement and livelihood rehabilitation
practices.

3.3 Asset Inventory Survey
A census was carried out to prepare an inventory of lost or affected household and
community assets. The Asset Inventory practice was undertaken by team of valuation
experts. The Valuation Team assessed the affected households to determine affected
assets, to measure affected properties, and to confirm ownership of the asset with the
landholder/asset owner. Information was recorded on a Census and Asset Inventory form
which was developed prior to the valuation exercise. At the beginning Census data was
collected for 99% of the PAPs only, due to absence of the remaining one percent of the
households during the period of census survey despite several attempts. Gradually, in the
course of time during the write-up of the report, the remaining census data was collected


                  Resettlement Action Plan for Salayish- Segno Gebeya gravel Road Project       Page 25
Dessie City Services Office                          Amhara Design and Supervision works Enterprise


from the remaining PAPs and incorporated in the report. Once filled with the required
information the form was counter-checked and signed by the asset owner, and
representatives of the Kebele leadership.

For Salaysh-Segno Gebeya Gravel road Project, the cut-off date was 24 September 2012 – a
date by which base line survey was completed and it has been communicated with PAPs.
Assets, such as houses and structures, which are to be created or acquired by individuals or
groups after this date will be ineligible for compensation. The process was guided by
provisions of Proclamation No. 455/2005 that concerns the process of valuation; hence the
Replacement Cost Method of Valuation formed the basis of valuation.

Results of the survey provided data on: the PAPs’ (landholders’ and/or owners’) immovable
assets in the areas affected by the infrastructure development of the Project; demographic
characteristics of the affected households including: household size; age, gender,
educational level, occupation, landholdings and land tenure types; inventory of the affected
structures, and detailing the structures in terms of size, construction materials, and the
state/grade of each, to assist in calculating replacement values; inventory of affected public
services infrastructure and holdings.


4 SOCIO-ECONOMIC STUDY &IMPACT ANALYSIS

The Socio-economic analysis is made by applying descriptive statistics using both
primary and secondary data that was obtained through census survey, community
discussion, key informant interview, and secondary data sources.

The results of the socio-economy study covers, among others: current occupants of
the affected area to establish a basis for the design of the resettlement program and
to exclude subsequent inflows of people from eligibility for compensation and
resettlement assistance; standard characteristics of displaced households, including
a description of economic activities, labor, and household organization; and baseline
information on livelihoods (including, income sources both formal and informal
economic activities) and standards of living (including health status) of the displaced
population; The magnitude of the expected loss—total or partial—of assets, and the
extent of displacement, physical or economic; Information on vulnerable groups for
whom special provisions have to be made.

4.1 Demography of Households
Socio-economic survey was carried out on all households directly affected by the project.
Results of the survey analysis focused on household demographic characteristics including
marital status, age and sex of household head; household composition in sex, age, and
education level; and family size. The socio-economy survey indicates that the number of
households affected by the project is 221 with a population of 1251.

From the total 221 households 159, (78 percent), of the household heads were married, 18
were widowed, 17 were unmarried, 9 were divorced, and the remaining 18 were widowed.
Households mainly comprised nuclear family units consisting of a household head, spouse
and children, with few extended family members such as siblings, parents and grandchildren
of the household head.

4.2 Education Level
Out of the total project affected population about 11 percent were illiterate. There is a clear
difference on the percentage of illiteracy between the female and male population implying
the existence of gender disparity in education. The percentage of illiterate people was 15
percent for female population while it was only 8 percent for their male counterpart.

In general the education level of majority of the Project affected population is Secondary
School accounting 42 percent of the population followed by Primary School which has 25
percent share. Technical school students also account 11 percent of the population. The
percentage of higher education both secular and religious is relatively very small. The
distribution of population by educational level is depicted in table 3 and graphically illustrated
in figure 6.

4.3 Household Income
Out of the 229 affected households including Debals (1251 individuals) only 345 individuals
earn income from various economic activities. Number of Income Earner Household
Members varies among the households ranging from zero to eight people per family as
shown in table 4.

Of the total population only 38.1 percent are engaged in income earning economic activities
and the remaining 61.9 percent relies on them (see figure 7). In this case the dependency
ratio is approximately 1.58 implying that more than three persons depend on the income
earned by two family members. The percentage of the population that earns income is shown
in figure 7.

The percentage of these people by type of income source and economic activities is shown
in the following table. Day Laborers retired people which have the lowest income and more
vulnerable relative to others account 12 and 9 percent of the income earning people
respectively.

Majority of the income earner population are local traders with share of 30 percent followed
by government employee, day laborer, and retired with corresponding shares of 25%, 12%
and 9% in respective order.




        Figure 7 Distribution of Income Earning People by Type of Economic Activities


The statistical description of the income distribution indicates that households that have
different private business at their house were relatively superior in average household
income. Kiosks made of container also have better income relative to those households who
are employed in governmental and private firms. Therefore the income of the employed
people is relatively lower than others engaged in private small scale businesses. The number
of households within the various ranges of income earning was used to indicate the
comparative status of the kiosks, private businesses, employees’ incomes. As shown in the
following figure the number of employment income earners is the largest of all for the lower

income group while the number of private businesses is the largest of all for the higher
income groups.




Figure 8 Household Income Category by Economic Activities


The average monthly income of households is 1500.00 Birr for Kiosks, 3101.00 Birr for
Private Business, and 901.97 Birr for Employed respectively and the overall average is
1908.80 Birr. The monthly income ranges 50.00 to 7500.00 Birr for Kiosks, 50.00 to
20,000.00 Birr for Private Business, and 70 to 7500.00 Birr for Employed respectively.

4.4 Inventory of Affected Houses
A total of 229 households (1251 individuals) across the two Kebeles would be adversely
affected by the project. In addition to the affected households, two offices owned by Ethio-
Tele Com Company and Desie Zuria Woreda administration will be displaced by the project.

4.5 Value of Lost Structures and Assets
 In determining the replacement cost for affected houses and other structures, the following
 points are considered.

       The current construction cost for replacement
       The households who lose their house due to the project will receive full
        replacement cost at current price.

Calculating of compensation for all kind of structures was made as per current
market price at replacement cost. The affected structures are categorized as
per the material that the house or the structure is constructed.
Each item of house or structures categorized in 4 categories based on the
material used for construction:

    wall is cemented and painted, have ceiling made of chip wood, floor area is
    cemented, covered with plastic tiles.

    2.      Second class mud house only external wall cemented and painted, cloth
    or ceiling made of Propylene(Madabria) , cemented floor

    3.      Third class mud house wall is not cemented, painted mud wall with no
    ceiling.

    4.      Fourth class mud house not cemented, not painted do not have ceiling.

    B/ Building/ bricks/ e.t.c, has four class as above
    In addition latrines, showers, kitchens are estimated based on their specific
    standards. All fences are categorized as a first standard and the compensation
    is calculated based on the current market price of the material used to
    construct the fence.
    After grouping the houses or other structures as per the standard, the price of
    the houses was calculated using area for houses and volume for masonry
    structure as per current market price. During calculating the compensation the
    cost to demolish the structure was considered and salvage material will be
    given to the PAPs.

4.6 Loss of Trees

A total of 746 trees will be lost due to the project. The number and type of trees affected due to
the project is detailed in the Table 9 below.

The financial value for trees has been calculated based on the valuation principle by which the
value is estimated by summing up discounted incomes each plant can give over years until a
similar new tree comes to maturity. In this regard, the monetary value for each type of trees was
estimated based on productivity of each tree and current market price of expropriation of
landholdings for public purposes. The following table shows the summaries of the values of
trees.

4.7 Impact on Livelihood
The socio-economic status of the community found in the project area and sellers in the market
can be categorized as low living standard. Small businesses are the key activities and dominant
economic base and it is almost the only means of living for majority of the community around
the project area.

As understood from the community discussion and Keble administrators’ information economic
activities of majority of the community in the surrounding depends on commercial businesses in
the market place in the area. Therefore, the relocation process would affect the households
directly due to the loss of business income till the business is re-established at the new
settlement sites. On the other hand, the affected households may incur renting cost until the

house construction is completed in the new residential area. The monthly cost of residential rent
they would incur during the relocation process is shown in the table below.

Table 5 Temporary Monthly House Rent Cost for residential houses


             House Rent Cost (Birr)

Kebele     HHs    Monthly 3 Months

02         101       101,000       303,000
Total     150        150,000       450,000

It is envisaged that the time required for the process of relocation to permanent settlement site
requires a minimum of three months. Therefore the cost of residential rent the households
would incur during the relocation process is estimated for these scenarios as shown in the
above table. The budget formulation will be based on the three month scenario. For the
business operators who reside in kebele structure and for those (private &kebele) who used
their structure for both purpose the city administration has prepared a shade of 2.20mx3.75m at
Segno Gebeya and it is ready to distribute for PAPs. This helps them to continue their business
without interruption. For privately owned business structures the city administration and PAPs
agreed to demolish their property after they construct their shop in the newly assigned area
which is a long road side. Thus, there is no any disturbance in their livelihood.

4.8 Social Institutions

The customary local social institutions like Idir and Iqueb exist in the two kebeles, 01 and 02.
These social institutions and interaction are important social capitals affecting the livelihood of
the society as a whole. Therefore, any disturbance on the social order including settlement
arrangement will affect livelihood through its impact on the social fabric. Idir and Iqueb are the
most prominent social institutions that contribute to the social and economic well-being of a
community but susceptible to social impacts.
Almost all of the PAPs are beneficiaries of these institutions and relocating them far away from
their original location would affect them. If the PAPs are relocated in remote areas they will be
forced to join other Idirs to meet their social obligations which takes time and some money for
registration of membership which is difficult since they are in struggle of settling their livelihood
that is disturbed by the relocation. On the other hand their participation in Iqueb and other social
institutions also will deteriorate till they are well introduced with the host community and are
customized to their customs if that occurs at all. By considering this issue the city administration
in consultation with PAPs has selected a new resettlement area with a shorter distance (0.5km)
from the existing area. In addition all project affected people from each Keble are going to
resettle in the same place. Hence, the impact on their social interaction will be at minimal level
and can continue their social life as before.

4.9 Relocation Cost of Public Utilities

 This road construction project affects public infrastructures including electric, telephone, and
 water lines that fall within the road path. The impact on these infrastructures includes the cost
 of restructuring and temporary interruption of these public services with the concomitant impact
 on businesses, residents, and different offices of government and non-government
 organizations.

 There are electric and telephone poles, water lines, and electric transformers located within the
 row of road construction which requires relocation. Water tankers within the row which are
 used for water supply also need relocation arrangement. All of the electric and telephone poles
 that are to be displaced and relocated are wooden poles. It is estimated that two electric
 transformers, 106 electric poles, and 84 telephone poles, will be relocated. Ethiopian Electric
 power Corporation (EEPCo), Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation (ETC), and Desie City
 Water and Sewerage Authority (WSA) are owners of the electric and telecommunication
 infrastructures respectively that claim the compensation for the losses and responsible for
 relocation and maintenance activities.

4.10 Summary for Estimated Value of Lost Asset
The loss of the assets is quantified in kind and in monetary values based on the ease of
analysis. In these regard loss of land and loss of Keble owned rental houses are quantified in
kind since these assets are not compensated in monetary values rather they are to be replaced.
The owners that claim the compensation for the loss include, among others, private owners and
public organization.

5 LEGAL ISSUES AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK

5.1 Legal Framework
This Chapter presents a review of legal and regulatory framework applicable to the project since
a clear understanding of the legal issues involved in resettlement is necessary to design a
feasible resettlement plan. Hence, an analysis is made to determine the nature of the legal
framework for the resettlement envisaged.

Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) formulated based on these provisions for the entire
project and the entitlement framework worked out for the impacts relating to Desie Road project
is detailed below.

The 1995 Constitution of Ethiopia, Article 40(2), 40(4), 40(5) and 40(8) includes provisions that
protect the Ethiopian citizen’s rights to private property and set conditions for expropriation of
such property for state or public interests. For immovable property built on land, the Constitution
states that “Every Ethiopian shall have the full right to the immovable property he builds on the
land and to the improvements he brings about on the land by his labor or capital.? According to
Article 40(8) of the Constitution, the State may expropriate private rights over land: “without
prejudice to the right to private property, the government may expropriate private property for
public purpose? with prior payment of adequate compensation. Again, Article 44(2) of the 1995
Constitution stipulates that all people who have been displaced or whose livelihoods have been
adversely affected as a result of State programs shall have the right to receive adequate
monetary or other alternative compensation, including transfer with assistance to another
locality.

Proclamation No 455/2005 Expropriation of Landholdings for Public Purposes and Payment of
Compensation establishes the legal principles and framework for expropriation and
compensation.

Council of Ministers Regulations No. 135/200, on the Payment of Compensation for Property
Situated on Landholdings Expropriated for Public Purposes provide the procedures for
application of Proclamation No 455/2005.



5.1.1 World Bank Operational Policy (OP 4.12) on Involuntary Resettlement
The Bank’s policy recognizes that involuntary resettlement may cause severe long -term
hardship, impoverishment, and environmental damage unless appropriate measures are
carefully planned and carried out. For these reasons, the overall objectives of the Bank’s policy
on involuntary resettlement are the following:



                  Resettlement Action Plan for Salayish- Segno Gebeya gravel Road Project       Page 43
Dessie City Services Office                          Amhara Design and Supervision works Enterprise


       Involuntary resettlement should be avoided where feasible, or minimized,
          exploring all viable alternative project designs.
       Where it is not feasible to avoid resettlement, resettlement activities should be
          conceived and executed as sustainable development programs, providing
          sufficient investment resources to enable the persons displaced by the project
          to share in project benefits. Displaced persons should be meaningfully
          consulted and should have opportunities to participate in planning and
          implementing resettlement programs.
       Displaced persons should be assisted in their efforts to improve their livelihoods
          and standards of living or at least to restore them, in real terms, to pre-
          displacement levels or to levels prevailing prior to the beginning of project
          implementation, whichever is higher.

The OP describes World Bank policies and procedures on involuntary resettlement as well as
conditions that borrowers are expected to meet during operations involving resettlement of
affected groups. It requires an entitlement framework aimed at restoration of affected
livelihoods, replacement, and participation of and consultation with affected groups. A detailed
social assessment and development of an action plan having list of measures for betterment/
restoration of lost assets/ income is required to be submitted to bank before start of project
work. Further it requires that appropriate monitoring and evaluation be carried to ensure
achievement of project objectives.

There are some differences between the national Ethiopian legislation and the World Bank
Policy OP 4.12. These relate to the general principles for resettlement, eligibility criteria, the
notification period for expropriation and resettlement, and the procedures required throughout
the resettlement process.

The first main difference is that according to OP 4.12, resettlement should be avoided whenever
possible, while national legislation states that ‘expropriation of land will be done when deemed
necessary for public purposes’. The second difference relates to eligibility, that OP 4.12 entitles
those who have formal rights, claims to land and no recognizable legal right, to compensation,
while national legislation entitles only those who are ‘landholders’ with legal possession of the
land and who own property thereon. Another key difference is the notification period required.
National legislation requires that property must be handed over 90 days after compensation has
been paid, while OP 4.12 requires that displacement must not occur before necessary
measures for resettlement are in place.

5.2 Eligibility and Entitlement
Eligibility for compensation is discussed in Article 44(2) of the 1995 Constitution and
Proclamation No 455/2005. These give entitlement only to those who have formal legal
rights over their land holdings (properties). Proclamation No 455/2005, Article 2 (3)
stipulates that “Landholder means an individual, government or private organization or
any other organ which has legal personality and has lawful possession over the land to
be expropriated and owns property situated thereon. ? According to Article 7(1) and (2),
“.a landholder whose holding has been expropriated shall be entitled to payment of
compensation for his property situated on the land and for permanent improvements he
made to the land?. “The amount of compensation for property situated on the
expropriated land shall be determined on the basis of the replacement cost of the
property?.
Eligible PAPs are those PAPs, with clear possession of land in the land holding book
and therefore are fully eligible to:
a) Land for land compensation;
b) Compensation in relation to other properties/assets on the land;
c) Other relevant rehabilitation measures/assistance as per the Entitlement Matrix;
In addition the 2008 RPF of the Federal ministry of urban development and construction
developed for ULGDP states that city administrations should support and ensure the livelihood
restoration for PAPs who have no legal title. However, all PAPs of this project have legal title for
their holding and are eligible for full compensation for their property and city administration shall
provide a replacement land at new site.
The entitlement provisions listed below for the entire RAP substantively address the
requirements as per the agreed Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) for the project.

6 VALUATION OF ASSETS AND COMPENSATION FOR LOSSES

6.1 Compensation for Land
Land loss will be compensated through a land replacement. Thus, the city administration with
the assistance of kebeles prepared the land in keble 01 and 02. The site plan for the new
residential area is under preparation by the two kebles. The process of resettlement to be
followed to allocate land for each and every evicted person will be handled by the land
redistribution committee guided by the Urban Land Redistribution Directive under a close follow
up of government and other stakeholders.

6.2 Land Redistribution for Commercial Businesses
According to the design document of the gravel road at there will be a total area of around 1500
sqm free space and the identified vacant place which is found at Segno gebeya and 1000 sqm
around Menafeshia. Both sites are along the road side and are good places to conduct for
commercial activities. Thus, the City Administration in consultation with the PAP agreed to
allocate this vacant land for those PAPs that have been engaged in businesses.

The land redistribution will be carried out by the city administration. The PAPs will construct
shops for different businesses. The size of the land to be redistributed could be as per the
standard size of the city. Each PAP will have a legal title for their holing in the new business
area.

6.3 Compensation for Loss of Assets
Compensation for assets lost due to the road infrastructure development project including trees
buildings and other structures will be paid one-time to the project affected households as per
entitlement matrix. For structures, payment estimation is made at replacement costs at current
price. The compensation for each affected household is found by summing up the value of each
structure. Accordingly, the summaries of estimated costs of compensation for houses/structures
along the road segment are expressed mathematically as follows:

      RC= Q* P
Where: RC= Replacement Cost of a structure or other asset
      Q = Quantity of lost structure or other asset
      P= Unit price required for the construction or replacement of one unit of the lost asset

6.4 Compensation for Temporary Rental Houses
If the households to be relocated to other sites will temporarily reside in rental houses then the
cost will be covered through compensation payment. The compensation committee evaluated
the needed compensation on the basis of current market rental value for similar standard of

                  Resettlement Action Plan for Salayish- Segno Gebeya gravel Road Project       Page 49

housing for three months time with an average renting cost of 1000 birr per household the detail
presented on page 45 under table 5.

6.5 Compensation award and Public grievance redress
Each identified PAP will be issued with a letter of award or Entitlement Certificate in
Annex I for their acceptance or otherwise before payment is made. In the event of a
dispute or grievance, the grievance committee will handle the issue and settle within a
period of one month. No construction should commence before public grievance is
settled.

An Amharic version of Entitlement Certificate, containing details of the project area,
compensation for lost assets/property, and the date by which the PAP must vacate the
location or surrender rights to the property shall be prepared and displayed
appropriately within the kebeles and also the city administration offices. In case of
illiterates, the city shall provide assistance to ensure PAP understanding of the
document. Once the Entitlement Certificate has been signed, all payments will be made
directly to the bank accounts of the PAPs or by cheque.


7    Site Selection, Preparation and Relocation

7.1 Site selection
The new site for private land owners has been identified at kebele 01&02, in consultation with
PAPs. For Kebele tenants the city administration agreed to provide houses in two scenarios.
The first scenario is replacing old houses on the existing area by assessing vacant houses in
both kebles (01&02). This option is for those who are vulnerable (old and disabled). Accordingly
the city administration prepared twenty vacant houses in keble 01 and five vacant houses in
keble 02 a total of twenty five free houses has been identified.

All the vacant houses identified are similar in size and all will have two rooms. The seventy four
new houses which have 24 sqm areas for each house will be constructed by the city
administration in a new place identified by consulting PAPs. As it is presented earlier eight
debals (16 household heads) are identified as eligible to have their own separate house during
resettlement. Thus, all debals get separate house from the new houses which will be
constructed for all kebele tenants. The construction of new houses will take three months time
and planned to be conducted from April-June/2013.

For both Keble tenants and private houses the selected new residential area (01&02) has
necessary infrastructure services (road, electric light and water supply). In addition since the
new residential area is in a shorter distance from the existing (500m) there is no any
disturbance of social services such an s health and education and PAPs can use the service as
it was before.

7.2 Site Preparation, and Relocation
 The city municipal office will undertake site clearing, leveling and other necessary land
preparation activities to make it ready for construction and other engineering works before the
resettles take delivery of the land.

Those households who lost kebele owned rental houses will be provided with other rental
houses from the kebeles either for residential or business purposes that correspond to the
earlier purpose of the rented kebele houses used by the PAPs.

Procedures for physical relocation under the project, including timetables for site preparation
and transfer and legal arrangements for regularizing tenure and transferring titles to resettles
has been explained for the resettles and other concerned stake holders. City and kebeles
administration provides all the necessary support in transportation, relocation, and livelihood
recovery of the settlers.

The resettlement sites is equipped with all necessary infrastructures including electric power
supply, water supply, feeder roads, and telecommunication services as well as social services
such as schools, and health services. Therefore, the city administration is responsible to
facilitate the settlers to get these facilities and services individually from the concerned bodies.

With close follow up support of the city administration kebele administrations will construct
houses to replace for affected PAPs that have been beneficiaries of rental houses from the
kebeles. The houses will be constructed within three months time (April- June/2013) and no
project affected tenant will dislocate before the new houses are fully constructed..

7.3 Housing, Infrastructure and Social services Delivery at new site
Since the new residential resettlement area is in a short distance from the existing area it is
equipped with basic infrastructure such as water, Electricity and social services such as School
and health centers, PAPs can get these facilities as they accessed it before.

Comparison of Services at the new site and existing site

Services at the existing site

       Some keble PAPs are living as “Debal? (Two households live in one house)
       The settlement is very crowded
       Poor internal road network,
       Since the existing road is narrow problem to access fire tracks and vacuum
        tracks
       For Keble tenants limited communal toilet , some of them are dysfunctional
        Services at new site

       No more “Debal? way of living (each household will have one house)
       Presence of feeder roads which help easy access of fire tracks and other
        sanitary tracks.
       Kebele tenants will have communal toilet of better in quality and more in number
        as compared to the existing one, thus, the new residential area is better than the
        existing residential area.

        8. COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION

Consultation refers to the two-way transfer of information or joint discussion between project
proponent and the community in concern. It helps to build a rapport with the community and
helps to provide certain details on the area that planners cannot often foresee. It helps identify
impacts, the vulnerable groups, their source of vulnerabilities and the people and groups that
are likely to be affected. Besides, information provided during such consultations helps allay
fears and builds trust – a key aspect to the successful implementation of any project. Most
crucially, it helps to identify potential initiatives that can be developed to restore and rehabilitate
their livelihood lifestyles. Attempts were also made to elicit their views, needs and priorities of
PAPs regarding compensation, land redistribution and other impacts, etc.

The stakeholders’ consultations for preparation of RAP were made at city and kebele
administration levels. At a city administration level: Dessie City Services Manager, Infrastructure
Development Team Coordinator, and Infrastructure Development Team environmental
Protection Expert, and At Kebele level: Kebele Administrator; Kebele experts relevant for the
Project; Kebele authorities, and kebele communities such as, youth and women; and project
affected people were involved in the consultation.

Key issues and concerns have been raised during the consultation time are the following:

        How compensation will be determined and paid?
        The compensation may be low to construct a new house in the new residential
         area
        When and how their houses will be demolished?
        When the compensation will be paid?
        Where and how they will stay until their houses erected in new residential area?
        The new residential area may be far from the center and may lack infrastructure
         and may be far from other social services.
    
Private holders and keble tenants who use for business and residence including petty
trade
                They fear that their livelihood will be discontinued as a result of their
                 displacement in the new residential area.
Keble tenants for business and kiosks owners
        They raised their concern that the city administration may not give them another
         house which is convenient for business.
        Kiosk owners raised their concern that the city administration may not provide
         them suitable place to relocate their container.

            In responding to their concerns the city administration agreed to do the following:
                 Compensation will be provided based on current market price at
                   replacement cost.
                 In addition for private land holders the city administration agreed to
                   provide land of similar size in keble 01, 02 &10. The site has been chosen
                   in consultation with PAPs. The distance from the existing area is 0.5 -
                   06km and it has all infrastructures (water, electricity feeder road etc)
                 For keble tenants the city administration agreed to resettle by categorizing
                   the PAPs in to two. .
First category
           Old and vulnerable
           Disabled
           Poor female headed households
   Identification of vulnerable PAPs has been selected in consultation with PAPs.
Second category

            All Keble tenants who are out of the first category
After the identification of Keble tenants who are old and disabled (vulnerable) the city
administration arranged a replacement house in the old residential area by assessing vacant
houses. For the rest Keble tenants the city administration agreed to construct new house in a
place that has chosen in consultation with PAPs.

Consultations among the Community have created an opportunity to solicit their feedback; and,
to obtain the cooperation and participation of PAPs and other stakeholders in resettlement
planning and implementation.

      8.1. Consultations with Dessie City Administration Service Office
The following issues were discussed with the Dessie City Administration in meetings during the
survey and post-survey period.

        Possibility to avoid or minimize the need for resettlement; if resettlement is
         unavoidable, on the formulation of feasible RAP;
        the organizational arrangement of the City and its capacity to implement the RAP
         (in terms of input resources);
        level of public awareness and public attitude towards the Project;
        possible problems related to land administration issues (land redistribution,
         substitution and consolidation) and envisaged solutions;
        establishment of valuation/compensation and grievance committees at city level
         and treatment of vulnerable groups within the context of the Project;
        Perception of the city/kebeles about the project regarding possible advantages
         and disadvantages of the Project; and
        The need for having detour road during construction.

        8.2. Consultations with Kebele Administration
Discussions held with Kebele administration during the period of survey work. More
emphasis was given for administrative activities related with the project impact,
resettlement and compensation. In general the following issues were raised: Capacity
limitation: the implementation capacity of kebeles with regards to resettlement is limited
therefore the kebeles need support of technical staff, since some of the issues are
pretty complex in their nature.             Therefore, the city Administration should provide
technical assistance for the preparation of land use plans.

        8.3. Integration with Host Populations
Since the PAPs are limited in number and resettle in small distance from the exsiting area they
know each other with the neighborhood in the new residential area and no need to consult the
host community. However during this RAP preparation process consultation with the whole
community (both affected and host community) has been conducted to smoothly integrate the
resettles (PAPs) with the host community both keble tenants and private land holders.

9. PROCEDURES FOR COMPLAINTS APPEALS AND GRIEVANCE

      9.1. Grievance Redressal Mechanism
A grievance redressal mechanism independent of the compensation committee and
implementing bodies is essential to allow affected individuals to voice concerns and seek
redressal.

A dedicated project-specific Grievance redress committee has been established to sufficiently
address the grievances of the PAPs. PAPs have chosen their representative in the grievance
committee. Thus, two out of six members of the grievance committee is allocated for PAPs
representatives.

Any dis-satisfied party shall present his /her cases to the grievance redress committee. The
committee examines the case and responds within a period of 15 days. A party not satisfied
with the decision of the grievance redress committee can appeal a case to a court of law which
will be the final decision.

Affected persons will be exempted from all administrative and legal fees incurred
pursuant to the grievance redress procedures. All complaints should be received in
writing will be documented.

10. Institutional framework and Capacity Assessment for the RAP
     implementation

The effective and successful implementation of the RAP depends upon the institutional and
organizational arrangements made for its implementation. The project management system for
this RAP implementation is led by Dessie City Administration.

The city Administration has a responsibility to manage, coordinate, monitor and evaluate the
implementation of this resettlement action plan (RAP).
It has the Project coordination office which is responsible for overall coordination and
management of the project in collaboration with other concerned core processes (departments)
under close supervision of the City Administration Mayor and Manager’s Offices.

Accordingly, the city administration had assigned the project Coordinator, Environmental and
Social Management Focal Person for day to day management of the project implementation.

The city administration has experience in dealing with issues of resettlement due to its prior
involvement in implementation of liquid waste treatment project in the city. Thus, the city
administration will implement this RAP by using the previous experience for the mentioned
project.

  The following department will work to effectively implement this RAP:

       Dessie City Mayor and Manager’s Offices;
       The ULGDP Project Coordination office(concerned with overall project
        coordination & management);
       Land Administration and Construction Permission core process(concerned with
        resettlement issues)
       Infrastructure Improvement Core process(concerned with Road construction and
        related issues);
       Office of Finance and Economic Development; and

       Two Keble administrations (01&02)

Dessie City Administration has overall responsibility for controlling overall quality and timeliness
of the RAP implementation and compliance with all aspects of the ULGDP Operational Manual
will be ensured.

The City Administration office, the concerned Kebele Offices, PAPs and community
representatives are the major institutional organs to implement the RAP. Partnership with
external stakeholders would also be important for resource mobilization and successful
completion of RAP implementation.

The Ministry of Urban Development and Construction can provide technical support and
guidance during and after resettlement process for impact evaluation


11. Implementation Schedule of Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)

The RAP process has been developed in previous sections beginning from data collection
and analysis. This section describes procedures to be followed while implementing
Resettlement Action plan for restoration of affected people’s livelihoods. It takes into account
the income restoration activities, institutional arrangements, implementation schedule,
grievance redress mechanisms, costs and budget as well as monitoring and evaluation of
the Resettlement Action Plan implementation.

        11.1. Livelihoods Restoration Strategies
The basic objective of income restoration activities is that no project affected persons shall
be worse off than before the project implementation. Restoration of pre project levels of
income or livelihoods is an important part of rehabilitating individuals, households and socio-
economic and cultural systems in affected community. Income restoration schemes had
been designed in consultation with affected persons and they were approved programs
designed to benefit them through their representatives in resettlement steering committee
Based on the information collected during the socio-economic study, strategies had been
framed and detail activities were planned.

Actions planned to be undertaken to assist the affected people:

        Compensation for land, structures, and all other lost assets paid in full before
         relocation;
        Compensation for temporary house rent payments till they finish construction of
         residential houses at the selected settlement site;
        Free transport and costs removal for reestablishment and relocation
        Special care and assistance in rebuilding houses and follow up will be
         undertaken only to help vulnerable group of people(old people and patients who
         cannot be assisted by relatives to erect their houses in the new residential area)
         during    resettlement process besides compensation payment. This will be done
         by the project coordination office and various committees established for
         implementation of RAP;

        Creation of Job opportunity for employment to daily laborers and unemployed
         PAPs in accordance with their skills and capabilities to be employed (enrolled) in
         the project which can be done by incorporating obligatory article in the contract
         agreement document for the civil work contractor.

        11.2. Implementation Activities
RAP approval and Public disclosure/workshop: Upon approval of the final RAP, the
executive summary of the RAP shall be translated into Amharic a local language and posted to
all accessible places for PAPs and the community. In addition a public consultation and the
disclosure workshop will be conducted at a location in Desie City with the affected people and
other stakeholders.

Payment of compensation: All handing over of the property such as land, structures and
compensation will be made in the presence of the affected party and the kebele and city
compensation committees. No construction should commence until compensation of these
items has been completed.

12. COSTS AND BUDGET

Budget estimates for RAP implementation has been prepared considering the following costs:

    13.          Monitoring and Evaluation

            a. Monitoring of the Resettlement Action Plan Implementation
Monitoring of resettlement action plan involves periodic follow up and checking to ensure that
activities are being undertaken according to the planned schedule. It is concerned both with
timely completion of physical activities and proper utilization of inputs (financial, human,
material and technical) resources during implementation.

RAP implementation will be closely monitored to provide the project implementer with an

                  Resettlement Action Plan for Salayish- Segno Gebeya gravel Road Project        Page 65
Dessie City Services Office                          Amhara Design and Supervision works Enterprise


effective basis for assessing resettlement progress and identifying potential difficulties and
problem areas. Monitoring will be carried out by Dessie City Administration ULGDP
Coordination Office and Social Development Specialist at UGCBB. It would include reporting
on performance, progress and problems encountered to the City Administration Manager
Regularly.

Monitoring during resettlement and relocation process would utilize the baseline established
by the socio-economic study undertaken during preparation of this RAP to ensure that
people are properly resettled, restored and recovered.

Monitoring is an internal management function allowing the Core Process (department)
responsible for implementation of RAP to measure physical progress against milestones
established so far.

            b. Internal Monitoring
The internal monitoring will be performed by the project Coordination Office. The objective of
internal monitoring is to ensure that there is fairness and transparency while property valuation
and compensation payment process take place. It would also concern with checking whether
Resettlement Action Plan is performed as per its schedule. The main focuses in internal
monitoring would be ensuring application of the resettlement policies and regulations specified
in the resettlement action plan.

Dessie City Administration mayor’s and Manager’s offices will undertake all basic supervision on
completion of compensation payment, infrastructure development at new site, how access to
social services, utility lines, and market ensured, how the required changes in livelihoods of
PAPs ( income restoration, and degree of satisfaction of PAPs) ensured during implementation
of resettlement action plan.

The main source of data for internal monitoring would be the data base generated from the RAP
implementation; for e.g. records on compensation for assets, periodic activity reports, the day-
to-day observations by implementing staffs. The office will make a summary report starting from
the commencement of the activities and special events will be reported on continuous basis.

The project coordination office of the city administration would also undertake the monitoring of
the resettlement implementing office. The main responsibility of project coordination office is to
assess the performance of the Resettlement Action plan for the gravel Road Construction
project based on periodic report from resettlement action plan implementing office and its staff.
The Project coordination office would submit comprehensive report to the city administration to
take corrective measures in case of problems.
Monitoring would check whether the following issues are achieved or not:

     Public meetings held;
     Completion of asset inventories, impact assessments, and socioeconomic studies;

Dessie City Services Office                           Amhara Design and Supervision works Enterprise


      Grievance redress procedures in place and properly functioning;
      Compensation payments disbursed on time;
      PAPs’ Income& livelihoods restoration and development activities initiated;
      Monitoring and evaluation reports submitted
      Community awareness raising and capacity building trainings conducted;
        Formation of various committees to assist resettlement process completed;
      Launching programme done at appropriate time;
      Installation of facilities and utility lines started;
      Allocation of necessary resources to complete resettlement action plan as per
         its schedules;
      Community participation in resettlement action plan implementation ensured;
      Task assignments and implementation arrangements done on time;;
      Logistics for demolition of houses made available; &
      Resettlement of people commenced and completed.


             c. External Monitoring
External monitoring is the responsibilities of Ministry of Urban Development and Construction.
The major external monitoring areas include;
     Checking whether the project implementation is on its right truck or not.
     The overall fairness and transparency of the property valuation, and compensation
      payment procedure followed, process, and Progress in RAP implementation;
     Progress of compensation payment;
     Appropriateness of grievance redress mechanisms; and
     Problems encountered and measures taken.

             d. . Evaluation
Evaluation is concerned with assessing whether planned activities actually achieved the
intended goals in terms of inputs, outputs, outcomes and impacts. Impact evaluation is
needed to determine that recovery has indeed taken place on time and succeeded.
The indicators for achievement of the objectives under the resettlement and restoration
program are of three kinds:

    Process indicators-indicating project inputs, expenditures, staff deployment, etc.
    Output indicators- indicating results in terms of numbers of affected people compensated
     and resettled, training held, credit disbursed, etc.

Dessie City Services Office                          Amhara Design and Supervision works Enterprise


   Impact indicators-related to the long term effects of the project on people’s lives.


            e. Impact Evaluation
Impact e v a l u a t i o n gauges t h e effectiveness o f the RAP and its implementation in
meeting the need of the affected population. The purpose of impact evaluation i s to
provide the project executing agency& donor (The City Administration and the World Bank)
with an assessment of the effects of resettlement, to verify internal performance
monitoring, and to identify adjustments in the course of the RAP implementation as
required.

            f. Completion Audit

The key objective of this external evaluation or completion audit is to determine whether the
project executing agency’s efforts to restore the living standards of the affected population
have been properly conceived and executed. The audit will verify that all physical inputs
committed i n the RAP have been delivered and all services provided. In addition, the audit
will evaluate whether the mitigation actions prescribed in the RAP have had the desired effect
or not.

The completion audit will be undertaken after all RAP activities—including development
initiatives have been completed, the result of completion audit thus, enables the donor agency
to undertake corrective action, if any, as recommended by the auditors before the project is
completed. The completion audit will help to measure the City Administration efforts for
resettlement, compensation, livelihood restoration, and development support..

            g. Conclusion
We could conclude that the project has both beneficial and unintended impacts. As far as
beneficial impacts are concerned, it would contribute to increased access to social services and
communication in Peripheral zones of the city as well as connecting the city to western werda
and minimizing vehicle overcrowding and consequent emission in the city.

We could also learn that the proposed project has negative impacts on landholdings, housing
structures, and trees of the PAPs and physical displacement of the project affected people. It
would also have indirect impacts on vulnerable groups like female headed household and aged
household heads specially those who are living in Keble houses.
The implementation of this project would have indirect impact on social network of affected
people to indigenous community institutions like Iddir, as they will be separated from
membership and services. However, all these impacts can be addressed by the city
administration if this RAP is properly implemented.
