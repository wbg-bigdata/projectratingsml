INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria for the equivalent
of US$6.0 million to help finance an education project. The loan would have
a term of 25 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at seven and
a quarter percent per annum.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        The economy of Algeria is described in paragraphs 2-8 of the
President's Report of the same date on a proposed loan to the Democratic
and Popular Republic of Algeria for a Highways Project (Report No. P-1274-AL).
A Country Data Sheet is attached in Annex I.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
3.        For a review of past and prospective Bank Group lending in Algeria,
reference is made to paragraphs 9-13 of the President's Report of the same
date on the proposed Highways Project. Annex II contains a summary statement
of Bank loans as of April 30, 1973.
PART III: THE SECTOR
4.        The education and training system in Algeria has been assigned
three main functions within the overall economic development strategy.
First, it is expected to respond quickly to the demand for skilled manpower
generated by the rapid industrialization of the country. Secondly, it should
support the reinforcement of national culture, Algerianization of the labor
force and progress towards achievement of economic independence. Thirdly,
it is considered as the most effective way of improving social mobility
and redressing income disparities between groups and regions. The combined
influence of these factors explains the unusual pace and scale of Algeria's
efforts in education and trainng.
5.        Prior to independence in 1962, literacy had spread to only 10 per-
cent of the population; nearly all high-level administrative and managerial
posts were filled by Europeans, and less than 10 percent of jobs requiring
technical or professional skills were held by Algerians. The high priority



which education has received in the past decade has raised the literacy rate
to over 25 percent; since 1962-63, enrollment has more than doubled in prim-
ary education, quintupled in secondary education and increased more than ten-
fold in higher education. The urgency and dimension of the education effort
are also reflected in the educational budget: public spending on education
is close to 10 percent of GDP - one of the highest ratios in developing coun-
tries. Educational investments accounted for 36 percent of the Government's
capital budget in 1970, and 27 percent of the recurrent budget.
6.        The structure of the formal education system in Algeria is largely
patterned after the traditional French model. Until 1970 it consisted of a
si.\-year primary course normally beginning at the age of six, a two-year post
primary course for those unable to gain admission to secondary schools, a sec-
ondary course of seven years in the lycees, or -- for those who failed to
qualify for the lycees - a four-year course in separate schools which offered
general education and post-secondary courses of three to six years duration
at the universities or other third level institutions. Since 1970, the sec-
ondary level has been divided into a first cycle of 4 years, and a second
cycle of 3 years. Education is free and (in principle) compulsory between
the age of 6-13.
7.        The rapid growth of the education system has led to structural im-
balances and bottlenecks. The supply of qualified Algerian teachers is still
insufficient, particularly at the second and third levels. Unit costs per
graduate are relatively high and completion rates are low. Regional inequal-
ities in the distribution of educational opportunities are marked and the
percentage of girls enrolled at the three levels of education has remained
fairly stagnant since 1963. Lastly, the growth of technical education
throughout most of the 1960's has lagged behind. In particular, at the
third level, enrollment distribution continues to be heavily biased against
engineering and agricultural sciences as well as against natural sciences.
8.        The Government has recognized that radical changes are required in
the structure and contents of the education system to increase its efficiency
and relevance, and to improve the chances of equal access to education. Given
the time required to prepare and implement any comprehensive reform of the
formal system and the need to increase output in the shortest possible time,
partial reorganization measures had to be taken. One of these measures was
the creation of a new type of institution, the institute of technology, in-
tended to train both middle-level technicians and highly specialized profes-
sionals. The approach breaks away from the traditional pattern in several
ways: entrance requirements are not necessarily based on examination cer-
tificate levels and credit is given for work experience; programs are worked
out in terms of actual job requirements; new specializations are offered;
the curricula are a combination of in-school and on-the-job training; the
school year extends to eleven months and examination procedures are geared
to test professional competence rather than academic proficiency. Since
1969, institutes of this type have been set up for mining, petroleum tech-
nology, agriculture, commerce, planning, tourism, public works, mechanics,
topography, public health and telecommunications. Each institute operates



-3-
under the authority of the technical ministry concerned. Some existing teacher
training colleges have been converted into Technological Institutes of Education
to increase the output of much needed primary and secondary school teachers.
9.        This approach represents an imaginative educational innovation as
well as a flexible way to meet pressing manpower needs. Although it has led
to some duplication and overlapping, the misallocation of resources would
have been much greater with a straight expansion of the traditional system.
The Algerian Government is aware that further expansion of the system of
technological institutes will have to be selective, carefully planned and
coordinated with the development of university education. In the long run,
as the university system becomes more responsive to the economy's manpower
needs, most, if not all, technological institutes are expected to be absorbed
into the university system. A first step towards a radical reorganization of
the university system is represented by the University Reform Law approved in
1971. At the same time, increased emphasis is being placed on universities
of science and technology; two will be built under the next Four-Year Plan
(1974-1977) at Algiers and Oran, and others are expected to be established
before 1980. By that time, enrollment in post-secondary education is expected
to exceed 100,000 students, with an annual output of about 12,000 graduates.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
10.       A report entitled "Appraisal of an Education Project in the Demo-
cratic and Popular Republic of Algeria" (No. 116a-AL, dated May 22, 1973) is
being distributed separately. A Loan and Project Summary is attached as
Annex III. The proposed Education Project was appraised in November/December,
1972. Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington, D.C. on
April 24 to 30, 1973. The Borrower was represented by Mr. Aoufi, Secretary
General, Ministry of Finance; Mr. Abdelkader Bousselham, Minister Plenipoten-
tiary; Mr. Zerouta, Adviser to the tinister of Finance; Mr. Chabane, Technical
Adviser to the Minister of Finance; and Mr. Tedjini, Director of Agricultural
Education, Ministry of Agriculture.
General
11.       The proposed loan is designed to assist in the improvement of three
technological institutes and to provide technical assistance for a pre-invest-
nment study of a fourth. The project would support the ongoing expansion and
reorganization of technical education and help overcome manpower shortages
in critical sectors of the economy such as agriculture, natural gas, mining
and metallurgy, plastics, construction materials, mechanical construction
and electrotechnology. The project would include:
(i) a new technician center of the Algerian Petroleum Institute
at Setif and expansion of another center at Oran;
(ii) supplementary equipment for the new Institute of Mining and
Metallurgy at Annaba;



(iii)  expansion of the fristitute o0  Agricultural Technology at
Mostaganem; and
(iv)  about 13 man-years of technical assistance to finance a
ore-investment study of the Institute of Light Industry
and to provide the services of specialists in educational
materials and equipment procurement.
12.       The estimated total cost of the project is equivalent to $10.2 mil-
lion.  The proposed loan of $6.0 million would finance 59 percent of total
project costs and 83 percent of foreign exchange costs. The remaining for-
eign exchange costs are not eligible for Bank financing because of government
regulations which reserve civil works in education projects to domestic con-
tractors. Procedures used for selecting contractors meet requirements of
economy and efficiency. If the reserved construction items were excluded
from the project, the proposed loan would represent 80 percent of estimated
total cost.  As the project includes a large element of furniture and equip-
ment costs, the foreign exchange component is relatively high.
The Algerian Petroleum Institute (API)
13.       The Algerian Petroleum Institute (API) was created in 1965 to train
tecx1nicians and specialized engineers for the various aspects of petroleum
techlnology. In 1971, it also started an undergraduate program to educate
engineers for the exploration, production and refining of petroleum as well
as in new fields such as plastics technology, liquefied natural gas, applied
chemistry of substances other than hydrocarbons, and combustion in motors.
At present, enrollment is between 50-60 students in post-graduate courses
at Dar el Beida, 420 students in technician courses at Oran and about 300
students in undergraduate courses taught in premiises borrowed from the Na-
tional Institute of Hydrocarbons at Boumerdes. The Technician Center at
Oran also serves as a base for exploration work in the Sahara and for
training of skilled workers in drilling at Hassi-Messaoud.
14.       Since its establishment in 1967, the Technician Center at Oran
has produced over a thousand technicians in geology, drilling, oil produc-
tion, petrochemistry, drafting and mechanical engineering. Present enroll-
ment at the Center is 420.   The level of entry is normally the baccalaureat
in mathematics or technology although a somewhat lower level of academic
achievement is sometimes accepted for those with at least three years ex-
perience in industry. The courses are intensive and oriented to specific
job requirements. Training includes field work and periodic assignments
in industry. The proposed expansion would consist of a new section for
liquefied natural gas catering for about one hundred students. Curricula
and syllabi, space standards as well as basic equipment lists have been
prepared with the assistance of the Chicago Gas Inst:Ltute and are satis-
factory. The proposed loan would finance total expenditures for furniture
and equipment estimated to cost about $530,000. The Government would fi-
nance construction as well as internal transportation and insurance of fur-
niture and equipment, the estimated cost being $630,000 equivalent.



- 5 -
15.       The proposed new Technician Center at Setif would enroll 100 stu-
dents in a two-year course in plastics technology and would graduate about 45
specialists each year. Courses would have a strong practical orientation and
would include periods of on-the-job training in industry. The Center would
be located close to a new industrial complex for the production of plastic
films and sacks. In order to minimize expenditure on highly specialized
equipment, the Government has given assurances that students and instructors
from the Center would be allowed to make use of specialized equipment installed
in the new plants. The proposed loan would finance $590,000 worth of furni-
ture and equipment, while the Goverrment would provide $660,000 equivalent
for construction, local transportation and insurance. Detailed curricula
and master equipment lists are being prepared by the Educational Development
Corporation in Boston, Massachusetts and would be reviewed by the Bank. A
condition of disbursement on this project item would be the Bank's agreement
that the curricula are consistent with the outline of study programs already
accepted and that the equipment lists are consistent with curricula require-
ments.
The Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (IMMA)
16.       A new Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (IMMA) is being built at
Annaba under an agreement with the USSR. At full capacity, IMMA will enroll
about 3,000 students - 1,200 in engineering courses of 5-6 years duration
and 1,800 in technical courses of 4 years duration. Basic specializations
will be in mining, metallurgy, building materials, mechanical construction,
electrotechnology and chemistry. Most of the necessary equipment and fur-
niture will be provided by the USSR. The first phase of construction of
the new complex will be completed before the beginning of the next academic
year, when facilities will be available for the first three years of the
engineering program and the first two years of the technician courses.
Enrollment, which is now 530, will grow to 1,600 by 1975 and will reach
full capacity of 3,000 in 1980. Normal entry classes will then be about
200 engineering students and 450 technician students per year, with an
estimated output of 170 and 380 respectively.
17.       The entry requirement for the engineering course is normally a
baccalaureat in science and mathematics, but acceptable candidates without
this qualification must first enroll in a preparatory year. For the tech-
nical course, the entry requirement is completion of the first cycle of
secondary education. At both levels, a national competitive examination
screens the candidates. Curricula are well planned with emphasis on actual
production processes used in Algerian industry. For the next five years,
about 80 percent of the teaching staff will be from the USSR. The proposed
loan would provide $1.9 million for supplementary equipment, including a
small computer, which cannot be supplied from Soviet sources. No problem
of compatibility between Soviet equipment and the proposed supplementary
equipment is expected to arise, since the latter would consist of specialized
units separable from the rest, such as library materials, electronic compo-
nents for a language laboratory, teaching aids, a materials testing labora-
tory, a specialized workshop and two specialized physics laboratories. This
equipment responds to well defined curricula needs and projected rates of
utilization are satisfactory.

The Institute of Agricultural Technology (IAT)
i3.       The proposed extension of the Institute of Agricultural Technology
(IAT) would meet an essential need in the agricultural. sector, where scar-
city of trained agricultural manpower is a major obstacle to organizational
and technological improvements.   In 1970, Algeria had only 350 agricultural
engineers and less than 650 technicians; the reed for trained personnel is
essential to the success of the agrarian reform launched in 1971 to redis-
tribute land and improve agricultural production.    The expansion of IAT will
provide four additional specialized workshops - one each in topography, agri-
cultural production, macihinery and animnal husbandry - for IAT's third and
fourth year students, together with 130 small field unlits and 18 vehicles
for practical training. Elimination of constraints imposed by the lack of
practical facili7ties will pernit an expansion of enrollment from 2,000 to
4,000 and a more practical orientation of courses.
19.       The Institute, which is supported by a French program of technical
assistance, offers a four-year post-secondary course leading to a diploma at
the higher technician level (ingenieur d'application).. The level of instruc-
tion is intermediate between that offered by the National Institute of Agron-
omy, which trains degree-level agricultural engineers, and the Regional Schools
of Agriculture, which train middle-level technicians. Other features of the
Institute are the efficiency of administration and programming, the interdis-
ciplinary approach of curricula and the extensive use of modern educational
technology. Courses are organized in a common cycle of two years followed
by progressive specialization. In the second and third years, periodic
field assignments of up to four weeks duration are organized for groups of
4-5 students, supervised by a fourth year student. Ten months of the fourth
year are spent in the field to obtain better kcniowledge of actual production
processes, prepare a thesis and provide technical assistance to state and
cooperative farms.
20.       At presernt, students in the field are accommodated in provisional
facilities in the Mostaganem area borrowed, in most cases, from state farms.
The project would permnit the establishment of a national network of small
field units adjacent to selected state farms and provided with dormitory
facilities, an office and elemetitary equipment. The network of 130 field
units would cover a wide range of agricultural and ecological conditions.
At full capacity, LAT would graduate about 850 diploma-level technicians
a year. The proposed loan would provide $1.4 million of a total of $3.4
million for construction, furniture and equipment.
Project Administration and Technical Assistance
21.       The project would be coordinated by the Ministry of Finance and
implemented by the Institutes of Teclhnology concerned. The proposed loan
includes $400,000 for the services of specialists in educational materials
and equipment procurement and for a pre-investnient study of an Institute of
Light Industry. The study is to determine the economic and pedagogical justi-
fication of an Institute of Light Tndustry, which might be financed by the



- 7 -
Bank at a later stage, and would include a survey of manpower needs in the
sector, design of curricula and syllabi, and preparation of detailed sched-
ules of accommodation and equipment lists.
Civil Works
22.       The Government follows the policy of reserving all contracts for
civil works in education to national contractors. Expansion of the Algerian
Petroleum Institute at Oran and Setif, and the construction of additional
workshops for the Institute of Agricultural Technology at Mostaganem which
would normally be suitable for international competitive bidding, will there-
fore not be financed by the proposed loan. However, in order to ensure that
teaching areas and space allocations for equipment are adequate, the Govern-
ment would send architectural designs to the Bank for review. In the case
of 130 field units for the Institute of Agricultural Technology (40-70 m2),
their modest unit cost (about $11,000) and their geographical dispersion
render international competitive bidding impracticable; it is therefore
proposed to include their foreign exchange cost in the proposed loan.
Procurement
23.       Local manufacturers of furniture and equipment would be allowed a
margin of preference equal to the existing rate of customs duty applicable
to competing imports or 15 percent of CIF price, whichever is lower. Bid
comparisons would be made in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. At
present, Algeria is not a member of any regional trading association; tariff
preferences on imports from the EEC have recently been eliminated.
Disbursement
24.       Disbursements would be on the basis of:    (i) 100% of the CIF cost
or ex-factory price of furniture and equipment; (ii) 80% of total expenditure
for technical assistance; (iii) 50% of total cost of civil works for the con-
struction of field units for IAT and (iv) 30% of related professional fees.
The project would be implemented over a three and a half year period. While
the implementation schedule is tight, it reflects the urgent nature of the
project and is considered realistic in view of the Government's previous
achiievements in implementing education projects.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
25.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Democratic and Popular Repub-
lic of Algeria and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Execu-
tive Directors separately. The draft agreement conforms to the usual pattern
for loans for education projects.



- 8 -
25.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
26.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
