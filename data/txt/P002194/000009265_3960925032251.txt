PROJECT COHPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF RWANDA
FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 567-RW)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the First Education
Project in Rwanda, for which Credit No. 567-RW was signed on June 30, 1975
for  US$8.0 million.    The  credit  amount  was  subsequently  reduced by
US$1,621,000 due to two cases  of misprocurement.   The project was closed
December 31, 1983 but disbursement continued to September 12, 1984, at
which time a further US$110,099.27 was cancelled.
This report was prep-red by staff of the UNESCO Cooperative
Program and later revised by the Bank's Africa Regional Office staff. The
Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education Project Implementation Unit
School Financing and Construction Service assisted in the preparation of
the report by providing, inter alia, detailed technical information which
we gratefully acknowledge.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
but the project was not audited by  OED  staff.   The draft PCR was sent to
the Borrower and its agencies for comments in March 1988. No comments were
received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
RZPUBLIC OF RUANDA
FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 567-RW)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
The First  Education  Project  (Credit  567-RW,  in  the amount of
US$8.0 million) was identified in March 1974 and soon after was prepared by
the Government with UNESCO assistance.    The  project was appraised by the
Bank in September 1974 and reviewed in November 1974. Total project cost
was estimated at  US$9.0 million,  or  RF  810 million, including contin-
gencies, with foreign exchange cost at  US$6.18 million (69X of the total).
The IDA Credit of US$8.0 million was to cover 892 of total project cost and
the Government would finance the rest.  Following Board approval on June 9,
1975, the Credit Agreement was signed on June 30, 1975. The Credit became
effective on December 1, 1975 after two postponements. The project was
originally scheduled to be completed in  December 1981 and the Closing Date
was to be June 30, 1982.    Instead,  the project was completed in December
1983 and the final Closing Date was  December 31, 1983.  The project sco":
was changed during implementation,  partly  as a consequence of misprocure-
ment which resulted in the cancellation of US$1.6 million out of the total
US$1.73 million cancelled from the Credit. When the final disbursement was
made on September 12, 1984, a total of US$6.27 million had been disbursed.
Oblectives and Scope
In line with the Government's educational reform which was later
articulated in the Second Development Plan, 1977-1981, the project's main
objectives were to improve the quality and efficiency of primary education
in the first phase of a long-term program of educational development. To
this end, the project was to provide:
(a) Civil works, furniture and equipment for:
(i) About 150 workshops for practical subjects with an aggregate
capacity for about 6,000 students;
(ii)  A printshop, including paper,  for  the printing of about 2.7
million textbooks and 1.6 million teaching guides;
(iii) An office building for the School Financing and Construction
Service (SFCS, effectively the project implementation unit)
and vehicles for SFCS's operation; and



(vii)
(b) Technical Assistance for:
(i) About 32 man-years of civil engineering technician services
to assist local craftsmen at various construction sites;
(ii) About 10 man-years of architectural and procurement services;
(iii) About two man-years of specialist services for the operation,
maintenance and repair of the printing equipment to be pro-
vided the printshop; and
(iv) About four man-years' consultant services during project
implementation for the evaluation of the financial management
and construction procedures establiahed by FSCS for the
purposes of the project.
Implementation Experience
In retrospect, this education project - the first in Rwanda - was
far too complex for an implementation unit with no prior experience. The
SFCS, which was specially created within the Ministry of Primary and
Secondary Education (MINEPRISEC) by Executive Decree, faced at the outset
many organizational and wanagement problems which caused most of the imple-
mentation delay.   The  SFCS was  burdened with too many responsibilities
without adequate trained staff to carry out satisfactorily its designated
functions. These functions, besides the standard PIU responsibilities,
included the administration of technical assistance (TA) personnel and
management of  a  revolving  fund  (para.  4.02).    Inexperienced in Bank-
financed projects, the SFCS did not fully understand the Bank's procurement
guidelines and did not see the need for a procurement specialist. Addi-
tionally, a high staff turnover adversely affected monitoring/evaluation
and particularly project procurement and accounting during the first four
years of the project (paras.  4.05-4.06).    This SFCS weakness was largely
responsible for the two misprocurement cases that resulted in the cancella-
tion of 20Z (US$1.6 million) of the Credit and modification of the project
(para. 4.06 and Annex 9).
During implementation the number of workshops to be constructed
under the project was expanded from 150 to 250 (which was part of a total
of over 900 the Government planned to build throughout Rwanda) and the
responsibility for workshop construction  was  shifted to the Communes from
the SFCS which then became a procurement agency for the workshops, supply-
ing building materials such as cement, steel, roofing, etc. The responsi-
bility for site supervision, originally planned for expatriate staff under
SFCS, was subsequently passed on to local technicians under the Communes.
The 40Z implementation time overrun was due mainly to the huge increase in
the  Government's  construction  program,  periodic  shortage  of  building
materials, and administrative and financial problems (para. 1.06). The
final project cost  of  US$6.9 million was  232  lower than the appraisal
estimate. The cost difference was due to the financing of some components



(viii)
by other donor agencies, cancellation of part of the Credit, and cost-
sharing by the Coumunes.    Building  construction, even though costing 26X
lower than estimated originally, actually providod 552 more space for the
workshops built by the Comunes using volunteer asd contract labor, instead
of the 150 which were to have been b-ilt through the SFCS (para. 1.07 and
Annex 3).
Results
Overall the project achieved most of its physical targetsa the 250
school workshops vere completed, as part of the 924 workshops (one per
school) built  by  the  Government  (para.  6.01)    The  quality  of theso
workshops, however, is below  average  because  they are poorly constructed
and equipped (paras. 4.16-4.25 and Annex 7); and it is doubtful that the
Comunes will have the resources to maintain them adequately (para. 4.28).
The main purpose of the workshops is to provide the facilities for
implementing the educational reform in which primary education is to be
extended from six to eight years with greater emphasis on learning
practical subjects. With the exception of schools with two 7th and 8th
grades, it is doubtful that the workshops nationwide are fully used because
of staff constraints, shortage of water, inadequate land for agricultural
activities, and the lack of fungible materials for practical work.
Although this project component made no significant contribution to
developing an economical school construction program, as was envisaged at
appraisal (para. 1.15), it has nevertheless aided the school reform program
by making it possible to introduce pre-vocational training in primary
schools and to improve the quality of instruction.
The printshop, on the other hand, is well constructed (para.
4.22), with equipment procured through a grant from the Federal Republic of
Germany (para. 4.26), which also provided technical assistance in printshop
management, accounting and maintenance, supplemented by UNESCO/UNDP train-
ing. Despite this assistance, however, the printshop has not been a
success because of: (a) failure to appoint Rwandese staff to key management
and accounting positions and (b) non-cost-effective operation (paras.
6.14-6.15). Although the printshop was to produce and distribute 2.7
million textbooks and 1.6 million teaching guides, there is no information
on the extent to which these targets have been achieved (para. 6.11).
The process of institutional development had a good start through
the establishment of the SFCS in Hay 1974, a major Credit condition. The
office building, completed in May 1983, is adequate. Following initial
difficulties, which arose partly because no procurement officer was
appointed, the SFCS has accumulated experience in implementing projects,
such as the IDA-financed Education II and Education III, and projects
financed by the Government and other bilateral agencies (paras. 6.19-6.21).
At the Commune level, the Government decision during project implementation
to transfer financial responsibility for school reform to the people and
their leaders (bourgmasters) has given them as well as district inspectors
valuable experience  in  school  construction.    By  the  same  token, the
Communes are also responsible for the maintenance and operational costs of
the school workshops (para. 1.17).



(ix)
Sustainability
The lack of fungible materials for teaching practical subjects in
many Commune school workshops suggests the absence of adequate financial
resources to sustain the physical maintenance and educational operation of
the workshops (paras. 4.28 and 6.04).    In  the case of the printshop, the
problem of financial stability and profitability could be resolved if the
enterprise  is  commercialized  (par&.  6.15).    While  some institutional
development has taken place in the SFCS, its sustainability depends on the
financial and human resources the Government is prepared to continue to
invest in it. The sustainability of the workshops, the printshop and the
SFCS in turn has a direct bearing on the sustainability of the Government
program to improve quality and efficiency in basic education. This could
be assessed after the completion of the Second Education Project, Credit
1263-RW, expected in September 1988.
Findings and Lessons
In addition to what is outlined in the PCR (paras. 1.15-1.22), the
following  findings  and  lessons   may   be  culled  from  this  project's
experience:
(a) For first-time projects, the Bank Group should ensure that
the PIU (in this case, the SFCS) should be staffed according
to conditions spelt out in the Agreement and that such staff
be thoroughly familiarized with Bank Group project implemen-
tation procedures to establish sound project management,
accounting and financial control (paras. 1.04 and 1.11-1.12);
(b) Project monitoring and evaluation should be a built-in, on-
going responsibility of the PIU to ensure that project
activities are in line with objectives (para. 1.13); and
(c) Adequate funds should be provided for technical assistance to
local communities which have been delegated the responsibili-
ty for school construction and maintenance to ensure that
such  community  participation  has  a  reasonable  chance of
success (para. 1.14).



I. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Project Objective
1.01      The principal objective of the First Education Project was to support
the Government's Educational Reform incorporated in the Second Development Plan
1977-1981. The project focused on the Reform's objectives related to primary
education and changes in curricula emphasizing rural/agricultural needs. This
included a major structural change in the Education and Training System with
the following implications: (a) prolongation of primary education from 6 to 8
years for the 7-14 years' age-group with introduction of practical subjects in
grades 7 and 8 in workshop extensions to schools and target of universal
primary education by 1986; (b) orientation of 90 percent primary school leavers
to CERAI (Centres d'enseignement rural et artisanal integre) for elementary
vocational training in grades 9-11; and (c) orientation of 10 percent primary
school leavers to the reformed secondary school system. Othar actions planned
included: discontinuance of the secondary 3-year "tronc commun", re-training
required primary teachers in practical subjects, increased proportion of
day-students, increased coeducation, increased secondary school size to minimum
240 enrollment, termination of double-shift and automatic promotion. The
intent was to reflect the reality of life in Rwanda and ensure that the
majority of primary school leavers would have a higher probability of being
absorbed into the economically active population.
Project Content
1.02      The purpose of the project was to assist the Borrower in financing
the first phase of a comprehensive approach towards improving the quality and
efficiency of primary education. The project consisted of provision for: (a)
about 150 workshops for the teaching of practical subjects with an aggregate
capacity for about 6,000 students; (b) an instructional materials printshop and
paper and related materials for the printing of about 2,700,000 textbooks and
about 1,600,000 teaching guides; (c) an office building for SFCS and vehicles
for SFCS's operation; (d) about 32 man-years of civil engineering technicians'
services to provide technical advice to local craftsmen at the various
construction sites; (e) about 10 man-years of architects' and procurement
specialists' services; (f) about two man-years of specialists services for the
operation, maintenance and repair of the printing equipment; and (g) about four
man-years of consultants' services for the evaluation, during the
implementation of the project, of the financial mechanisms and the construction
procedures established by SFCS for the purposes of the project.
Project Amendments
1.03      The project was amended several times to: (a) rehabilitate the
premises of the Gitarama Rural Center for Training Craft Instruction (CRAFAG);
(b) increase the number of school workshops to be constructed and equipped
(from 150 to 250); (c) reduce the disbursement percentages specified in the
Credit Agreement (following a misprocurement case); (d) cancel portion of the
Credit (following further misprocurement cases); (e) reallocate the proceeds of
the Credit; and (f) postpone the Closing Date of the Credit.



-2-
Project Implementation
1.04      The Agreement became effective December 1, 1975 about two months
beyond the specified date, after a Project Revolving Fund was opened with an
initial sum of US$100,000 equivalent deposited by the Government of Rwanda.
During the start-up period, numerous technical and managerial problems arose,
due mostly to unsound administrative procedures and the lack of appropriate
accounting and financial control. The result was several cases of
misprocurement, which, following intensive Government/IDA consultation led to
cancellation of US$1.62 million representing a significant amount of the Credit
funds (Annex 9) and redefinition of the project. The inadequacy of SFCS's
supervision of this first IDA project became even more obvious because of the
increasing number of othe.L projects it had to implement. Its failure to
recruit a procurement specialist only exacerbated the situation. After this
initial period, during which progress reports and reimbursement applications
were submitted incomplete and with no regularity, the Government made staffing
changes in the SFCS management. A mission by an accountancy expert was called,
after which the SFCS accounting system improved considerably.
1.05      Physical execution of the project was the task of SFCS's technical
personnel recruited under a UNESCO/UNDP Technical Assistance Project
(RWA/74/020). Because of the shift of responsibility of the workshops to the
Communes, the expatriate staff was not employed to supervise the school
workshop sites; instead, this responsibility was carried out essentially by
local technicians (recruited during the course of the project) who were
expected to monitor all MINEPRISEC school construction work. As a result of
the change in the scope of the project, the SFCS became a procurement agency
supplying cement, steel, roofing, etc., to many more construction sites but
without having the possibility to provide adequate site supervision. Selection
of Rwandese nationals qualified for supervising the project construction work
proceeded at a snail's pace. Most architectural and accounting aspects of the
project were neglected until it was too late to undo the damage, which led to
misprocurements and a high turnover of technical assistance experts (who also
left without Rwandese counterparts).
1.06      The project execution period extended over 8 years instead of the
6-year, 9-month period originally projected. This was due mainly to the large
increase in the Government's construction program, difficulty in supplying some
construction materials, and administrative and financial problems. It was
agreed that disbursements would continue to June 30, 1984, 6 months after the
revised Closing Date and 24 months after the Closing Date initially envisaged.
Finai disbursement occurred on September 12, 1984, with a total amount of
US$6.27 disbursed.
1.07      The estimated total project cost in June 1975, was US$9 million and
the Credit was to cover 89% of that amount (US$8 million). Final cost was
US$6.9 million or 23% less than estimated. This difference was caused by the
cancellation of part of the Credit and the takeover of some project components
by other donor agencies. Despite cancellation, corresponding project items
were carried out. Building construction represented 45% of total cost and was
26% less than originally estimated, despite the total built area being greater
than estimated at appraisal. The main reason for this difference was due to
the change in financing materials for 250 workshops with the communes supplying



-3-
labor instead of the original 150 which would have been built through SFCS.
Simpler finishes and the subsequently reduced unit cost of the school
workshops also contributed to the change from appraisal figures. The equipment
for the printshop and the equipment supplement for the school workshops were
provided by a grant from the Federal Republic of Germany, which represented
about 16X of that originally estimated.
1.08      The sites chosen for the various project facilities are adequate.
Design and construction of the printshop and SFCS officels are good. However,
the school workshops are extremely simple and of mediocre but adequate
construction quality.
1.09      Procurement of imported building materials did not always follow
agreed Bank Group guidelines and included items not used for the facilities
financed under the project. The situation caused cancellation of part of the
Credit funds and a revision of disbursement percentages.
1.10      Construction began in July 1976 and ended May 1983, reflecting: (a)
the enlarged scope of the Government school building program, which included
the IDA project; and (b) the time overrun required for the completion of the
SFCS office building and the printshop. There is virtually no furniture in the
school workshops and while the equipment provided is adequate, the lack of
fungible supplies limits its use.
Compliance with Credit Conditions
1.11      In the haste to build 924 school workshops (250 funded under the
project) throughout the country, the (then) director of SFCS did not always
follow proper administrative and financial procedures, especially in
accounting. Workshops were eventually built by the Communes with help from
SFCS, which however was not equipped to manage a scattered program of self-help
construction. Specifically, SFCS at first failed to keep separate accounts for
the IDA-financed and Government-financed workshops. This not only would have
provided the possibility to distinguish between IDA and Government expenditures
and also to verify SFCS operating costs. In 1980, four SFCS reimbursement
applications were rejected for lack of adequate documentation and failure to
comply with Credit Agreement conditions.
1.12      As noted, a procurement specialist was never recruited.  The views of
the Government held that the SFCS director and the chief accountant jointly
could perform that function. In retrospect, however, an experienced
procurement specialist was needed, and clearly the misprocurement problems
could have been avoided by hiring such a person.
1.13      Project funds were allocated for consultants to evaluate periodically
the financial mechanisms and construction procedures set up by SFCS over the
life of the project. No such consultants were ever nominated by the
Government. At IDA's suggestion, a final inspection of the 250 workshops
was undertaken in September/October 1981 by SFCS with the help of three UNESCO
architects to properly assess implementation status and facilitate accounting
corrections.



-4-
1.14      Finally, SFCS funds were never adequate to provide the technical
assistance for local communities to properly maintain those schools selected to
receive a workshop that did not actually meet the required criteria.
Project Operating Outcomes
1.15     As a result of the Government's Educational Reform at the primary
level, a total of 924 school workshops were built, 250 of which were financed
under the project. The construction of these buildings, however, made no
significant contribution to developing an economical school construction
program, as was envisaged at the time of appraisal.
1.16     In accordance with project design, the SFCS waa established.  The
start-up period was difficult due to staffing problems, but the situation
improved, with the activities of the Unit extending to include technical
assistance to the entire school construction program of the MINEPRISEC.
Standard plans for different school buildings were prepared to facilitate
construction projects of this type in the future.
1.17     During implementation, a fundamental decision was made by the
Government that interested population groups (Communes) and their leaders
(bourgmasters) were required to contribute to the program of building school
workshops and 7th and 8th-grade classrooms. In this way the local population
acquired useful experience for future projects. Also, the skills of district
inspectors who participated in this program improved substantially. The
Government, with this decision, transferred the financial responsibility of the
Reform to the Communes, thus involving these population groups not only in
construction but in maintenance and operational costs thereafter.
Lessons Learned
1.18      Project Administration.  The school workshop building component of
the project placed considerable responsibility on the local authorities for
both construction implementation and financial management. Emphasis also
should be given to participation of the local population (on a volunteer basis
through Movement for Community Participation and Development (UNUGANDA), in
actual project implementation if reasonable supervision can be assured.
1.19     Project Implementation
(a) A wide-ranging project having a very large number of items
scattered in many remote project locations is difficult to manage
and monitor in Rwanda. More compact projects with less items,
less widely scattered are more readily controlled by both parties
and are more appropriate for the country at this time.  However,
such a lesson applies with difficulty to primary schools.



- 5 -
(b) Planning for availability of adequate expertise, built-in
evaluation and continuous follow-up by the Bank on procurement and
accounting matters are necessary to offset implementation
problems, because of difficulty in following Bank regulations and
frequent personnel changes.
1.20      Staff Requirements.  During project implementation, problems
frequently arose with procurement accounting and work in progress reports,
which was traced to the lack of qualified personnel within SFCS. In the
future, the tasks assigned to SFCS should be closely monitored to ensure that
the Rwandese staff acquire the qualifications that will enable them to run the
SFCS office with full efficiency. It seems particularly important to have a
full staff complement (both administrative and technical) as prescribed at the
time of appraisal.
1.21      Future projects should be less complex and include provision for more
intensive local supervision. Also, an improved filing system should be
maintained by the SFCS. Such documentation would serve as a means to
facilitate dialogue between Bank representatives and the Rwandese authorities.
1.22      Education Sector Issues.  The weaknesses in the educational sector,
which the project was designed to reduce, should be addressed progressively and
according to a strategy adapted to the human and financial resources the
country can make available, without compromising what ought to be a fundamental
principle, the access of a larger number of children to formal schooling.  The
goal of professionalizing primary-school teaching should be synchronized with
the development of the local communities and the modernization of agriculture,
the only two local spheres able to absorb young school leavers. The basic
issue is therefore one of efficiency and resource mobilization.
Recommendations
1.23     The following general recommendations emerge from the experience with
the First Education Project:
(a)   While SFCS is responsible for all school construction work of the
MINEPRISEC, it is recommended that SFCS build up its administrative
staff and develop a network of district inspectors in the provinces to
better establish its supervisory authority. Building programs of the
magnitude under consideration also should enable SFCS to effect a
general improvement in the building indu;try in Rwanda by
pressing for the use of local materials and by providing the
opportunity to carry out preliminary studies on the architectural,
technical, economic, and financial aspects of such ventures.   The
role of SFCS should however be increasingly focused on planning,
programming and supervision while design and architectural work can be
subcontracted to the private sector;
(b)   Technical assistance from a variety of sources contributed
significantly to the execution of all project components. However,
in the future, attention should be given to accelerate the
process of recruiting specialists while coordination and integration
of their functions should be carefully monitored so that project
timetables can be more closely met;



(c)   The recent Rwandese evaluation of school workshops was limited to a
survey of physical facilities. An in-depth study would be required to
focus on the operation of these workshops, capacity utilization,
efficiency, costs and financing and learning outcomes. Only with such
results at hand could the Educational Reform be evaluated correctly
and a strategy evolve for future action; and
(d) To reduce the already heavy financial burden incurred in the
production of school textbooks, the printshop should be granted more
autonomy to increase its commercial viability and thus enhance its
return on investment. The printshop should be better managed and if
unable to compete in terms of unit printing costs, the printing of
school textbooks should be contracted to local private printshops. In
retrospect, more caution should have been applied in the preparation
of this project component.
1.24    Lessons learned through the implementation of the First Education
Project were incorporated into the Second and Third Education Projects as
follows: design of the Second Education Project was less complex and focussed
more specifically on a smaller number of components, albeit secondary
institutions, to facilitate project implementation. Particular attention was
paid to ensuring that project implementation units had adequate administrative
capacity, especially with regard to project accounts and the Bank Group
insisted on the recruitment of key professional staff required. In this
regard, allowance was made for the lack of familiarity with Bank Group
implementation procedures which were evident in the First Education Project and
extra monitoring was accordingly provided. The Third Education Project was
designed to further strengthen the planning, management and training capacities
of MINEPRISEC and MINIFOP through technical assistance and staff training. It
also established a self-sustaining textbook/teaching materials replenishment
scheme as part of the supply and distribution of textbooks and other teaching
materials.
II. INTRODUCTION
2.01      This Project Completion Report was prepared by a UNESCO team
comprised of Messrs. Ben Mady Cisse, Coordinator and General Education
Specialist, and X. Nuttin, Consulting Architect. The team spent time between
February 19-25, 1984 in Washington, D.C. and in Rwanda between March 11-27,
1984 gathering the necessary information to complete the draft version
subsequently submitted to the World Bank. Messrs. CissG and Nuttin then
travelled to Washington in July 1984 to discuss its contents with Bank staff
from which a French language version was produced. The report was translated
into English by Bank staff and subsequently revised.
2.02      The Rwandese authorities worked closely with the UNESCO team
providing whatever documentation was available and all necessary logistical
support.



2.03      The team's recome ndations and conclusuon are based on: (a) careful
consideration of the documents examined; (b) the results of field Inspections;
and (c) discussions with the Rwandese officials and World Bank staff engaged in
the project. The draft UNESCO report was noted to reflect views of the team
and not necessarily those of the Government of Rwanda or of the World Bank.
III. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Socio-economic Context
3.01      With a population estimated at 5.6 million and a surface area of
26,338 km2, Rwanda is one of the most densely populated of the African
countries (211 inhabitants per kn2). The majority of the population (96%) live
in rural areas, which will be true for some time to come, since the urban
growth rate is intentionally kept low (6% per annum). The population is very
young, with 47% below age 15. Agricultural production, based on family-type
holdings averaging one hectare, is the dominant factor in the economy,
accounting for 47% of GNP and 73% of exports.
3.02      Rwanda's food production is barely sufficient to meet the needs of
its rapidly expanding population. Shortage of land, widespread unemployment,
malnutrition, high energy costs, and its landlocked site (the nearest port,
Mombasa in Kenya, is 1,700 km away) combine to make it one of the poorest
nations in Africa.
3.03      From 1973 onward, coinciding with the time of project implementation,
Rwanda enjoyed a period of political stability that was reinforced by a sense
of national unity and shared purpose.
3.04      In the face of growing economic difficulties, the 1977-81 Second
Development Plan aimed for self-sufficiency in food production as well as
reduced economic dependence on exterior sources. However, not all its
objectives were achieved, mainly due to the lack of qualified technicians and
managers. The 1982-86 Third Development Plan, while pursuing the same
agricultural, industrial, and commercial productivity goals, has improved
planning techniques and decentralized both the formulation and implementation
processes down to the level of the comunes which, through the
Directorate-General of Community Action and the participation of the "Banque
Populaire", are to play the major role of launching a grass-roots development
movement.
Education Sector
3.05      Orientation and Structure of the Education System.  The education
system Rwanda inherited at independence in 1962, besides being ill-suited to
the requirements of economic and social development, was fragmented in
character, consisting of several types of institutions supported by a variety
of governmental and non-governmental organizations spread across the country.



- 8 -
3.06      A reform was launched to rationalize the system, first in 1974 (but
was not implemented). Again in 1979-80 an ambitious reform, the "R£forme
Scolaire' was launched with greater success, the features of which were as
follows:
-    the age for entry into primary school would remain at 7;
-    primary education would extend over 8 yea&  with the addition of
grades 7 and 8;
-    following primary schooling, pupils would be divided into two
streams;
*   one to flow into secondary education (either vocational or
general) to prepare the much needed corps of mid-level
technicians;
*   the other stream flowing to three-year Integrated Rural and Craft
Activities Instruction (ERAI) designed to extend the instruction
begun in grades 7 and 8 far enough to allow pupils to be absorbed
into their local work environment; and
-        advanced studies were designed to provide training in priority
fields, such as agriculture and applied research.
3.07      These undeniably worthy goals encountered a series of major
obstacles:
(a)  At the primary schools, the considerable increase in number of pupils
in grades 1 to 6, in combination with the extension of the primary
to grades 7 and 8, could not be matched by a corresponding increase
in qualified teachers, so the percentage of properly qualified
teachers dropped to 35Z in Cycle I (grades 1-3) and Cycle II (grades
4-6). In 1985, about 58% of the 14,400 primary school system
teachers were considered academically qualified;
(b) The school workshops for grades 7 and 8 experienced a delay of two to
several years;
(c) The increase in the number of ERAI programs to 1,300 --the number
needed to accommodate the 46,000 pupils completing grade 8- proved
financially untenable and will remain so for the foreseeable future;
(d) Over 40 institutions train teachers to professional levels (D4, D5,
and D6), producing about 500 graduates per year. That number will
have to triple by 1990 to attain the percentage of qualified teachers
needed to cope with expanding enrollments;
(e) Secondary-school enrollment rates vary widely. They are highest in
Gitarama Prefecture and lowest in Byumba. Since there is a shortage
of teachers, the policy of steering a majority of pupils toward
vocational instruction cannot be quickly implemented. The Second IDA
Education Project should bring about a major improvement in this
area; and



(f) Higher education is administered by a single agency, the Ministry of
Higher Education, and is available at two institutions now
integrated, the National University of Rwanda (founded at Butar6 in
1963 with Canadian assistance) and the National Teacher-Training
Institute (IPN) established with French assistance (a new campus at
Ruhengeri). Drop-out rates at the two are alarming (43X), and are
particularly serious in the science and co_erce faculties.
Project Identification
3.08      A Bank Group economic mission visited Rwanda in October-November 1973
to study possible spheres of activity where the Bank might participate. A
second mission followed in March 1974, the purpose of which was: (a) to discuss
with the Rwandese authorities their priorities for the development of
education; (b) to identify an Education Project; and (c) to enter into
discussions on the general nature, content, and scale of this project.
Project Objectives
3.09      The project identified was designed to assist the implementation of a
reform of the primary education system emphasizing the teaching of practical
subjects closely related to everyday rural life. The project was formulated in
1974 by MINEPRISEC, with support from UNESCO and IDA. It was appraised by a
Bank mission in September 1974 and then reviewed again in Rwanda in November
1974. Negotiations took place in Kigali in April 1975 and the project was
approved by the Executive Directors of the Bank on June 9, 1975.
3.10      Project technical assistance for educational planning and curriculum
development was provided through UNESCO/UNDP Project RWA/74/020, 'Education
System Redesign and Planning." This assistance, together with that provided by
the Federal Republic of Germany, made it possible to increase the number of
workshops from 150 to 250.
Project Content
3.11      The purpose of the project was to assist the Borrower in financing
the first phase of a comprehensive approach towards improving the quality and
efficiency of primary education. The project consists of the following parts:
Part A
1.   Construction, furnishing and equipping of about one hundred and fifty
workshops for the teaching of practical subjects with an aggregate capacity for
about 6,000 students.
2.   Construction, furnishing and equipping of a printshop and provision of
paper for the printing of about 2,700,000 textbooks and about 1,600,000
teaching guides.
3.   (a) Construction, furnishing and equipping of an office building for SFCS
and (b) provision of vehicles for SFCS's operation.



- lu -
Part B - Technical Assistance
1.   Provision of about 32 man-years of civil engineering technicians' services
to provide technical advice to local craftsmen at the various construction
sites;
2.   Provision of about 10 man-years of architect's and procurement
specialist's services.
3.   Provision of about two san-years of specialists' services for the
operation, maintenance and repair of the printing equipment icluded in Part A.2
above.
4.   Provision of about four man-years of consultants' services for the
evaluation, during the inplementation of the project, of the financial
mechanisms and the construction procedures established by SFCS for the purposes
of the project.
Project Amendments
3.13      The Development Credit Agreement was amended several times as
follows:
(a)  The termination date for Credit effectiveness was extended from
September 29 to December 1, 1975, to allow additional time for the
Government to establish a revolving fund.
(b)  On January 29, 1976, after a request from the Government, Part A-(i)
of the Agreement was amended to include financing to furnish CRAFAG
dormitory accommodations and to provide equipment for the practical
training of instructors;
(c)  On December 5, 1978, Part A-(i) of the Agreement was amended again,
following negotiations between IDA and the Government, to allow for
the construction and equipping of a total of 250 school workshops
with capacity to accommodate a total of 10,000 students instead of
the originally planned 150 workshops (6,000 student capacity).
(d)  Also on December 5, 1978, as a result of problems with purchases of
building materials using an improper procedure, IDA informed the
Government of 50Z reduction in the amount being reimbursed until such
time as it made up the total sum to be deducted because of
misprocurement (Annex 9). In addition, IDA cancelled the sum of
US$130,000 allocated for the purchase of imported building materials
required for construction of the remaining school workshops.
(e)  On July, 1980, IDA notified the Government of the cancellation
(effective April 25, 1980) of US$1,491,000, which corresponded to
expenditures included under Part A-2 (Category 5) of the Credit
Agreement, following misprocurement in the award of a contract by the
Government for printing paper (Annex 9).
(f)  On March 15, 1982, the Closing Date of the Credit was postponed to
December 31, 1982, and on February 28, 1983 that date was again
extended, this time to December 31, 1983, when the project actually
closed.

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
General
4.01      The Developmeut Credit Agreement was signed on June 30, 1975 and
became effective on December 1 of that year, about two months beyond the
specified termination date, following establishment of a revolving fund in a
special SFCS account on September 25, and deposit by the Borrower of an initial
amount or US$100,000 equivalent, as stipulated in the Agreement.
Misprocurement problems resulted in the cancellation of US$1.62 million. The
original date for Credit effectiveness (September 29, 1975) was postponed to
December 1, 1975. The original Closing Date, June 30, 1982, was postponed
twice before Credit closure December 31, 1983. Disbursements continued to
September 12, 1984 at which time the balanced remaining (US$110,099.27) was
cancelled, resulting in a total of US$6,268,900.73 out of the original US$8.0
million disbursed.
4.02      The School Financing and Construction Service was created within the
MINEPRISEC by Executive Decree, March 11, 1975. Its basic functions were to:
(a) administer the IDA-financed project (coordination of project activities,
administration of technical assistance personnel, management of the revolving
fund, and preparation of periodic civil works progress reports; (b) prepare the
plans, lists of equipment and materials, and other tender documents required to
implement the construction works; (c) ensure the proper execution of those
works; and (d) liaise with the Bank (Annex 4).
4.03      SFCS was understaffed throughout the course of the project.  Although
the Director of the Unit was on duty from June 1975 and the accountant from
November 1975, no procurement specialist was recruited, despite a futile
attempt in early 1976. An assistant architect also was on duty, to be replaced
in March 1983 by one who was newly graduated. Support personnel (bookkeeper,
draftsmen, secretaries, typists, and drivers) were recruited as needed.
4.04      The technical assistance required was provided under UNESCO/UNDP
Project RWA/74/020. This arrangement called for the presence of five experts
(a project coordinator, specialists in pupil selection/examination procedures,
curriculum planning and methods, and printing equipment, and an architect) and
six United Nations volunteers for site supervision and construction works. The
services of this second group were not fully utilized. Instead, their function
was carried out by 10 A2 technicians, graduates of the Kicukiro Technical
Secondary School, the majority of whom had no experience. They were recruited
by SFCS and received 2-months' training by the SFCS technical staff after they
joined the Unit.
4.05      SFCS also suffered the effects of heavy staff turnover, a factor
which in part may explain why during the early years of the project the SFCS
functioned so poorly. This was particularly true in the area of accounting,
where there was no distinction made between expenditure- incurred by
IDA-financed school workshops and those incurred by the Government workshops.
Thus, there was no way to determine what part of the SFCS operating expenses
were charged to IDA project activities. Following missions by an accountant
expert in September 1981 and March 1982, the accounting system was entirely



- 11
reorganized into appropriate budget categories and is now adequate. Another by
product of staff turnover was that little attention was given to preparing the
required quarterly progress reports. The project completion mission was able
to find only three, covering a period of about 18 months (July 1982 to December
1983), plus an annual report for 1977. Moreover, SFCS had not prepared a
report for the project completion mission to Rwanda in March 1984.
4.06      Furthermore, numerous procedural problems arose throughout the course
of the project, causing the cancellation of nearly 20% of the Credit funds
(Annex 9). This was partly due to not having a procurement specialist and
partly to the inadequacy of the accounting system in place during the first
four years of the project.
4.07      From the technical standpoint, school construction had previously
taken place with no standardizing of specifications. To remedy this, SFCS
produced a series of standard school-construction plans of good quality that
were well suited to the country and its financial capability. These plans are
now used by the MINEPRISEC as well as by a number of donors agencies engaged in
school construction.
Civil Works
4.08      Sites.  The sites for school workshops had to meet several criteria.
They were to: (a) be adjacent to a primary school with at least two 5th and two
6th grade classes; (b) have at least one hectare of farmland; (c) be shared by
the surrounding communes; and (d) be located within a commune able to cooperate
on a volunteer basis in construction works. These criteria were met at the
first 40 sites, where 40 prototype workshops (approved in 1976) were built. A
list of 210 other sites was prepared by the Government in September 1980 as
part of the general list of 924 workshops the Government intended to build (one
per primary school). It is doubtful, however, that all the primary schools
selected for the other 210 workshops actually have two 7th- and 8th-grade
classes. In accordance with the education reform, those grades now must use
the workshops. The majority of schools have access to an area large enough for
farming, except for those located within more developed, urbanized areas.
4.09      The educational printshop is located 9 km from the center of Kigali,
on approximately one hectare of land, an area large enough to already permit
construction of several extensions if needed. The site has a slight gradient,
enjoys good road access, and is connected to the commune's water and electric
power networks. (The power supply is subject to occasional breakdowns and
frequent fluctuation in voltage).
4.10      SFCS's offices are located in Kigali itself, and although the site
has a steep gradient, it is easily accessible and well served by utility
networks. The same site also accommodates a small SFCS equipment depot and the
MINEPRISEC's Secondary Education Research Office.
4.11      Architectural Studies.  The responsibility for architectural and
engineering design and for construction site supervision was assigned to the
SFCS technical staff (UNESCO/UNDP Technical Assistance Project, RWA/74/020).
However, these responsibilities were sometimes taken over by different local
staff.



- 13 -
4.12      Before the arrival of the expatriate project architect in Rwanda in
June 1976, a consulting architect residing in the country was commissioned by
the MINEPRISEC to design the SFCS office building and the printshop and to
prepare the tender documents (the architectural design was actually prepared in
1975, although a contract was signed only in March 1976). Following arrival of
the UNESCO architect and his refusal to take responsibility for plans drawn up
by the consulting architect, the latter's contract was terminated in October
1976 on payment of a proportion of his agreed fee. New designs and bidding
documents were then prepared by SFCS.
4.13      The design of the prototype school workshop (construction of which
began in June 1976), was originally prepared by CRAFAG and approved by IDA in
July 1975. This design was later revised and simplified by SFCS prior to the
construction of an additional 210 project workshops.
4.14      The technical team of SFCS, which began operation at the end of 1976,
prepared the following sets of documents:
-    architectural designs for a new sc'a3ol workshop, completed in
November 1977 and approved in May 1978;
-    architectural design and tender documentation for the educational
printshop, completed in April 1977. Construction work of the
printshop began in August 1977, 14 months after the chief architect's
arrival in Rwanda. This delay was due mainly to the preparation of a
new design and tender documents following cancellation of the
consulting architect's contract in addition to the necessity to
discuss building design details with the German suppliers of the
printing equipment. Other difficulties, mostly associated with the
installation of air conditioning, were met as works progressed and
led to further construction delays; and
-    architectural design and tender documentation for the SFCS office
building followed closely the same time sequence as printshop
documentation. Plans for extension of SFCS's office were prepared in
December 1981.
4.15      Construction site supervision for the SFCS office building and the
printshop was carried out by the SFCS technical team. The project appraisal
report (May 1975) noted the supervision of workshop construction was to be the
responsibility of the commune bourgmaster, with assistance from the district
inspector and SFCS technical personnel. To that end, the UNESCO/UNDP project
RWA/74/020 called for recruitment of six United Nations volunteers to carry out
the field work. It proved impossible to recruit all six volunteers, and those
who actually did arrive in Rwanda were stationed in Kigali. Since it was
difficult to visit the various sites from Kigali, they could not be as
effective as anticipated. To speed the construction work, and in view of the
large number of workshops to be built, a decision was taken to decentralize the
site supervision on a district basis and to recruit supplementary local
personnel for that purpose. A group of 10 young technicians (whose salaries



- 14 -
and expenses were paid by the Kicukiro Technical Secondary School) were
recruited in the firs: quarter of 1970. Even though they received training
from the SFCS team, they were obviously unable to efficiently supervise all 924
construction sites planned under the Government's expanded program. The
quality of construction of the second group of workshops (of simpler design)
showed the consequences of this -- below average materials and rough
workmanship.
4.16      Architectural Concepts.  The prototype workshops comprise three
areas, each designed for a different activity: one semi-open space for
agricultural work and two enclosed spaces separated by storerooms for the
equipment and materials for teaching woodwork, metalwork, and home economics.
The building materials used in the workshop convt'ruction were clay bricks for
masonry work (with reinforced concrete beams and liatels), roof clay tiles, and
wooden roof framing from eucalyptus trees. T?i :3ticture was relatively heavy
and required a considerable quantity of timber cD:<I for the roof frame and for
kiln firing the bricks and tiles. Numerous modiiications were introduced in
the second type of construction to further simplify the structure and cut
costs: namely reduction of the span from 9 m to 7 m; rearrangement of the two
enclosed spaces, staggering the position of storage areas, to allow more
flexibility of use; use of sheet metal roofing and a reduction of roof-frame
size; use of adobe blocks; and elimination of the veranda (a detailed
description of the materials used is provided in Annex 6).
Generally the workshops are not only austere but also of below-
average quality. The major defects are:
-    poor natural lighting in the workshops and none in the storerooms;
-    workshops were supposed to be used for manual activities associated
with farming but offer no suggestion of this, instead seeming to
.xclude the outdoors;
-    few attempts have been made to prepare workshop approaches, making
access difficult during the rainy season;
-    building placement genurally ignores site aspect and natural
gradient; and
-    eaves are not wide enough to protect the building foundations from
water infiltration.
4.17      The SFCS office building is a simple, one-level construction.  The
structure itself and the materials used (clay bricks, metal roof frame, roofing
of corrugated cement asbestos sheeting, cement flooring, exterior joinery in
metal, and interior joinery in wood) are not out of the ordinary and thus
require no special comment. Following extension of its building in 1982-83,
SFCS was able to operate more efficiently.



- 15 -
4.18      The printahop includes a printing, binding, and storage area, of
1,050 m2, an office block of 133 m2, and a sanitary block of 37 m2.  The
building was designed to accommodate the equipment suppliers' specifications
and provides a large space (25-m span) that is both functional and well
lighted; unfortunacely it soon proved too small, although the actual covered
surface of the IDA-financed sections is 44% larger than projected at
appraisal. Extensions to allow for storage of printed products and to house
montage and composition operations were financed by the Government and the
Federal Republic of Germany. The extension span is covered by a metal frame
supported by reinforced concrete columns and intermediate steel-pipe supports.
The roof consists of self-supporting metal elements and the masonry work is
done with clay bricks. Central air conditioning (using water) was installed
subsequently a8 the request of the suppliers of the printing equipment, as was
an electric generating plant needed to back up the commune electric power
distribution system.
4.19      School workshops.  Construction of the school workshops was done by
the Communes using volunteer manpower (UMUGANDA) for site preparation and
contracting local skilled and unskilled labor for actual construction work.
Local building materials were purchased directly by the Commune bourgmasters.
SFCS was responsible for purchasing and importing of materials not available
locally and for their distribution to the Communes using vehicles leased for
that purpose. Purchases were made in two phases. Initially, invitations to
bid were issued in the region in 1976 for the initial deliveries of cement,
steel reinforcing bars, and self-supporting roofing sheets. However, the
cement supplier proved unable to deliver the quantity required, causing some
delay. The second order was placed by the Director of SFCS (acting on
instructions from the Minister of Education) in Nairobi in July 1978. This
order, involving very large quantities of materials, did not conform to
procurement procedures required by the Bank (Annex 9).
4.20      The Commune bourgmasters were responsible for entering into contracts
with workers and paying them. Invoices for the construction material for the
first 40 prototype workshops were forwarded by the bourgmasters to SFCS, whIch
then paid them. For the 210 workshops of the second phase, SFCS made lump sum
payments to the prefectures, based on SFCS's own estimates and the number of
workshops to be built. These sums were then distributed among the Communes by
a School Construction Management Committee active in each school district
(prefecture) according to the following criteria: (a) availability of
materials; (b) distance and cost of transporting materials not available
locally; (c) commune financial capacity; and (d) recommendations from the
progress reports to district inspectors.
4.21      The construction period scheduled for the 250 workshops extended from
July 1976 to October 1981, when a UNESCO technical mission 2/ estimated that
on average they were 87.6% completed.  During the same period, 674 other
workshops were financed by the Government and built under SFCS supervision, a
fact that partly explains the lengthy construction period. (The quality of
construction is discussed in detail in Annex 7).

4.22      Educational Printshop.  Following a call for restricted tenders in
January 1977, a contract for the construction of the printshop was signed the
following July with a medium-size local contractor. Work began in August 1977
and was completed by June 1980, i.e., after 34 months, including suspension of
activity for several months due to a shortage of cement, sheet metal, roofing
materials, and steel. Regional tender procedures were launched, (a) in June
1977 for the air-conditioning system and (b) in December 1981 for two electric
generators. Although completed in June 1982, the air-conditioning plant was
not fully operational until June 1983, when a false ceiling was finally
installed. The quality of construction is good and meets standard physical
requirements for a printshop.
4.23      SFCS Office Building.  SFCS's provisional office space became
available during the last quarter of 1975. Construction of its permanent
facility began in August 1977, after an invitation to bid in April 1977 and a
contract signed with a local contractor in July 1977. Construction work was
completed ten months later in May 1978. The contract for the office extension
project was signed in July 1982 and the work completed by May 1983.
Furniture and Equipment
4.24      Teaching Equipment.  In 1975, during negotiations, the Government
submitted a list of teaching equipment required for the practical subjects to
be taught in grades 7 and 8. The list was amended and approved by Bank staff
in June 1976. Following the 1977-78 educational reform, the list was revised
and submitted again to the Bank in February 1979, but it was considered
incomplete in view of the new curriculum orientation. Meanwhile, the Federal
Republic of Germany undertook to supply all the equipment on the list. A new
list of supplementary equipment was then drawn up in April 1980 and submitted
for approval the following November. Invitations to bid were issued in January
1981 and a contract signed with a local supplier in August 1982. The equipment
was distributed by SFCS to the district inspectors, who in turn distributed
them to the various schools. All the equipment was distributed by the end of
August 1983, but, at least during the completion mission visit to the
workshops, it seemed to be little used, mainly due to a shortage of
fungible supplies, about which the teachers frequently complained.
4.25      Workshop Furniture.  SFCS appears never to have devoted any real
thought to tne turniture for the school workshops which are limited to a few
joinery work benches and wooden blocks roughly fitted with anvils.
4.26      Printshop Equipment.  Printshop equipment was procured through a
grant from the Federal Republic of Germany and Credit funds were not used.  In
December 1982, the Government requested a reallocation of funds to allow
purchase of supplementary equipment to meet expanded needs.  Invitations to bid
were published in March 1983, a contract signed the following December, and the
equipment scheduled for delivery before June 1984. Regarding purchases of
paper (Annex 9), the Government adhered to the contract signed with the
successful bidder; however, in December 1982, the Government lodged a new
request for purchase of an additional 555 metric tons of paper, which IDA
approved in August 1983. Invitations to bid went out the following month and
contracts were approved by IDA in January 1984.

4.27      Equipment and Furniture for SFCS Offices.  SFCS prepared lists of
furniture and equipment required along with the related bidding documents.
Contracts were awarded on the basis of negotiation with suppliers represented
in Rwanda according to procedures acceptable to IDA. Deliveries began in
October 1975 and continued at intervals until July 1983 relative to need (SFCS
office, the office extension, and district offices in the 10 prefectures). The
heavy transport vehicles purchased in 1975 and 1977, the light vehicles
purchased in 1978 for the district inspectors, and those purchased in 1981 for
the technical evaluation mission were obtained on the local market, where
choice was limited to a few models because of no after-sales service for most
makes.
4.28      Building Maintenance.  School work.shops require a minimum of
maintenance because of the type of building materials used. However, it is
unlikely the communes will have the funds to replace the already deteriorating
hardware or roofing sheets. On the other hand, the SFCS offices and the
printshop are in good condition.
Technical Assistance
4.29      UNESCO was slow to recruit technical assistance personnel except for
the project coordinator, who took up his post in 1975. The architect did not
join the project until June 1976, one year after signature of the Agreement,
while recruitment of the six United Nations volunteers (scheduled to supervise
the school workshop building sites) was not only considerably delayed but
limited to three volunteers and an architectural associate (Annex 11). Three
expatriate architects succeeded one another between June 1976 and project
completion. A printing equipment consultant made several short visits to
Rwanda prior to the appointment of a printing expert in 1977. The consultants
recruited by UNESCO to carry out technical evaluation of the 250 IDA workshops
in October 1981 did excellent work, inspecting 90% of the workshops and
recommending ways to reduce building costs and improve designs. These
consultants wetre hired at the insistance of Bank Group staff in order to
actually determine the extent of actual work carried out, inter alia.
V. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
Estimated Costs
5.01      In June 1975, total project cost was estimated at RF 810 million
or US$9 million, including contingencies. The foreign exchange component
amounted to US$6.18 million (69% of the total). The Development Credit
Agreement signed provided US$8 million (89% of the total), with the balance to
be provided by the Government.
Actual Costs
5.02      Annex 1 provides a detailed comparative analysis of estimated and
actual project costs. Data on total actual costs and on cost distribution by
component were obtained from SFCS. Final cost was US$6.9 million, or 23% less
than estimated, a difference attributable mainly to: (a) cancellation of
approximately 20% of the Credit; (b) financing of the technical assistance



- 18 -
component (16% of total estimated cost) by a UNESCO/UNDP project; (c) purchase
of the equipment for the printshop using a grant from the Federal Republic of
Germany. Annex 2 provides an analysis of costs by category of financing.
Building Construction Costs
5.03      Actual building construction cost represented 45% of total project
cost. Although the number of school workshops built was much higher
than originally appraised (250 instead of 150), And although the final built
area was 55% more than originally planned, actual cost of the workshops was 36%
lower than estimated (Annex 5). The cost reductions were the result of:
intensive use of volunteer labor from UMNLGANDA; SFCS's simplification of the
workshop design in November 1977 (para. 4.13); and the fact that contingencies
and the effects of inflation were lower than estimated at appraisal (123% of
base cost for these two factors). The 21% increase in the cost of erecting the
SFCS office was hardly comparable to the 100% increase in built area; the same
is true for the printshop, where there was a 44% increase in built area for a
cost increase of 50%.
Equipment Costs
5.04      The Federal Republic of Germany assumed the financing of workshop
teaching equipment and the printshop facility. In both cases, only
supplementary equipment was provided under the IDA project, which explains why
the cost was 16% lower than originally estimated (contingencies included),
despite the fact that the printshop included items not originally planned
(air-conditioning and electrical generating plants), or 13% of total equipment
cost.
SFCS Operating Costs
5.05      Actual operating costs (up to December 31, 1983 and including
vehicles) amounted to 8% of total cost and were 26% higher than projected.
No valid observations can be made about this cost, since it is impossible to
break the final figure into operating costs attributable to the IDA project and
those chargeable to the other projects executed by SFCS. A pro rata allocation
of total costs was made on the basis of the number of workshops financed by
IDA, namely 250 out of a total of 924.
Technical Assistance Costs
5.06      The technical assistance component of the project, together with the
consulting services used to evaluate the project during implementation, were
taken over by UNESCO/UNDP Project RWA/74/020. Only the costs incurred with
respect to the expert-accountant and the consultant-architect were charged to
the project; however these costs were considered operating expenditures for
Bank disbursement purposes.

Building Areas
5.07      Annex 3 provides a comparative analysis of projected and actual
building areas. The figures given include extensions to SFCS office premises
and the printshop, which were financed by other donors. The following chart
compares surface area measurements for the two kinds of workshops implemented:
Surface Areas                  Type I (1975)    Type II (Nov. 1977)
Total surface area                  170 m2            162 m2
Surface area per work station         4.25 m2          4.05 m2
Surface area used for storage        15%              25%
Surface area used for work           851              75%
Credit Withdrawal Impact on Implementation Schedule
5.08      As a result of the misprocurement of building materials and following
the resulting Amendment to the Credit Agreement (December 5, 1978), the
disbursement percentages in the categories were reduced by 50Z as of December
1981 as a way to recover the amounts overpaid (Annex 9). The disbursement
schedule (estimated and actual) is given on page (iii) of the Key Project Data
and also in graphic form in Annex 8. Withdrawal of funds was slow during
1980-81, when four applications for disbursement were rejected by IDA for lack
of justifying documentation and non-compliance with the conditions of the
Credit Agreement. The Project Implementation Schedule (Annex 8) shows both
estimated and actual dates. The Project Closing Date, after being postponed
several times to enable the Government to submit requests for reallocation of
unused funds, was finally set at December 31, 1983, 18 months beyond the
original date.
VI. PROJECT OPERATIONAL OUTCOMES
Introduction
The project supported the improvement of the quality and relevance of
primary education in Rwanda and focused on institution building for project
implementation by: (a) construction of workshops for practical training of
pupils in grades 7 and 8 at 250 rural primary schools and providing retraining
in these subjects for teachers; (b) provision of a printshop to publish
textbooks and teacher guides; and (c) establishment of a Project Implementation
Unit (SFCS) to render architectural services for the Ministry of Primary and
Secondary Education.
General Outcomes
6.01      School Workshop Construction.  The school workshop project had no
great impact on local building techniques and construction approaches;
nevertheless, the joint efforts of the Government and the local population did
build 924 workshops (one per school) throughout Rwanda in a relatively short
time and under particularly difficult circumstances as regards communications
and supplies. IDA's initial financing of 250 of these workshops provided much
of the impetus for this large-scale mobilization.



- 20 -
6.02      Execution of this project component provided the physical means to
implement the education reform of practical education for Rwanda's youth
despite being plagued by administrative, accounting, and procurement problems.
The overlapping of the Government's program to build workshops similar to the
250 the Bank program was assisting, caused a tremert:us administrative overload
for SFCS, not to mention confusion about which worksoios were actually built
under the Bank program. This ultimately led to a freezing by the Bank of all
disbursements in 1979 and 1981. In February 1981, at Bank staff insistance,
the SFCS strengthened the various technical sections of its management, which
enabled construction of the Bank-financed workshops to proceed as planned.
This was achieved after three consulting architects (recruited and financed
through UNESCO/UNDP Project RWA/79/003) were able to identify and evaluate the
250 facilities financed under the IDA Credit.
6.03      The main purpose of the "Rhforme Scolaire' at the primary level was
the extension of primary education from 6 to 8 years and to shift from a
primary school system preparing a minority of students for secondary education
(access to which was about 9Z in 1985) to a fundamental school system preparing
the huge majority of students to the rural and non-formal labor market and
consequently all students must go through these additional two years. At
present this preparation is poorly done even when workshop tools and land are
available and questions could be asked about its duplication with the CERAI
objectives. These objectives consist of three years post-primary education
focusing on the teaching of agriculture and artisan skills with 25X of 8th
grade completers proceeding to CERAI. The Government, although well aware of
theses weaknesses shared by the CERAI as well as of the numerous failures of
similar approaches in Africa, still considers these two additional years as a
key part of the concept of orienting every level of the school system towards
the world of labor. The 8-year primary school system is divided in three
cycles, of which cycle III applies to grades 7-8 and focuses on practical
subjects related to rural (agricultural) life. The workshops developed for
this cycle are intended to expand the general education curriculum begun during
cycle II (grade 4-6) and to teach practical subjects concerned with agriculture
and stockraising, masonry, joinery, metalwork, and home-economics.
6.04      Use of Workshops.  Children spend only half a day at school, which is
divided evenly between general instruction and practical subjects. Thus, in a
school with two 7th and 8th grades the workshops are used every hour of the
34-hour school week, including recreation periods. However, this mode of
organization is certainly not found in all workshops throughout the country.
Some are located in zones where shortages of water or land limit certain
workshop activities; in other cases, the head teacher may be engaged in a
retraining program to enable him/her to teach some practical subjects, which
leaves little time for workshop teaching after performing administrative
duties. In other cases, the fungible materials supplied along with the school
furniture and workshop equipment may not have been replaced, so that classes
remain largely theoretical instead of intended practical experience.
6.05      School Curriculums and Textbooks.  Since the old curriculum has been
revised and new teaching methods introduced, new curriculum guides and
textbooks are required. Furthermore, the empirical sciences and systematic
study of the environment now have been incorporated into the curriculum due
to the excellent work by the research office for primary education and
integrated rural and craft education. Teachers' guides, lesson plans, and
textbooks have been prepared by this office for 7th and 8th graders studying
the following subjects: the environment; home-economics (e.g. cooking manuals



- 21 -
and technical data sheets on sewing); craft and trade work (guides and
technical data sheets on masonry, joinery, and metalwork); farming and
stockraising (guides and technical data sheets for both) mathematics for 8th
graders (guides). All teachers' guides and data sheets are illustrated and
have been supplied to each workshop.
6.06      Equipment and Furniture.  Equipment and furniture were supplied to
the workshops by several bilateral aid groups, but proved difficult to
coordinate. Ventilation problems still persist in the workshops so certain
activities cannot be undertaken. The district inspectors will need to point
out these probleas so that SFCS can make appropriate adjustments. Fungible
supplies still are not available in some workshops, leading to lack of
agricultural activities that deprive pupils of a comprehensive understanding of
various subjects. The national evaluation mission, which has visited all the
workshops, needs to look into the matter.
6.07      Teacher Coverage and Training.  The priority assigned by the Rwandese
authorities to implementation of the education reform was confirmed by the
assignment of qualified teaching personnel to grades 7 and 8. The price,
however, was paid by primary-school cycles I and II, where classes lost
qualified teachers to cycle III. A flexible type of training was designed to
prepare teachers for workshop in applied technical and craft activities. This
training was introduced in 1977 and provided the Gitarama and Butare
teacher-training Centers with Rwandese instructors through the IDA project and
bilateral assistance. Certified craftsmen and technicians of all types teach
1,152 7th-grade classes, 1,167 8th-grade classes, and at the 924 school
workshops that complement them. Aid from the Federal Republic of Germany is to
help upgrade their teaching skills by providing the means for in-the-field
follow-up, progressively reinforced by better initial training. The campaign
began with year-long cycles for 60 participants at each center. Due to the
pressure of current needs for more and better trained teachers, the longer-term
training is supplemented by intensive 3-week courses. Specifically, 420
teachers per year can receive training - 180 at Gitarama and 240 at Butare.
Each course provides instruction in four subjects throughout the 3-week period
for a total of 18 days. Course participants are split into four 15-member
working groups and are assigned to one of four workshops: masonry, joinery,
metalwork, and home-economics (cooking, sewing, and household economy),
changing classes at the end of each week. Weekly instead of daily rotation
gives participants a much better opportunity to study each subject area more
closely. Instruction in agriculture is provided 7 hours a week, while
technical drawing (a very useful basis for all training activities), is given
two hours a week. The center at Butare, although it employs different methods
(it is better equipped due to French aid), provides the same training. USAID
and West Germany are also participating in this campaign by training the
principals and teaching staff of the (ERAIs) responsible for the education of
pupils graduating from the 8th grade.
6.08       Student Enrollment.  Currently, of the 46,000 pupils graduating from
8th grade, the secondary system absorbs about 5,000 (1iZ) and the ERAIs (of
which there are 304) about 11,000 (24Z). If all potential students were
accommodated, it would be necessary to build 1,300 ERAI centers; however
financial constraints limited the projected number to 1,080 or two ERAIs per
commune. The Governments intention is to emphasize the quality of training
given there, which should be high enough to ensure graduating students will
find productive employment immediately. For that reason, there has been a
division of tasks between the Gitarama Center and Butare Teacher Training
College. The latter, in conjunction with a USAID team and the German mobile



- 22 -
teacher training unit, will help train ERAI principals and staff by monitoring
their work in the field; at the same time, it will also be possible to assist
CERAI graduates in their jobs. The Gitarama Center will be responsible for
full-scale refresher training for teachers of grade 7 and 8 teachers from the
primary school system. Despite difficulties, a far-reaching effort has been
made in teacher training, while the idea of "ruralization" is gaining
acceptance at all levels of the population, largely as a result of Bank support
which gave the initial thrust to this effort.
6.09      Selection and Guidance of Secondary School Enrollment.  The
Government has strengthened the staff of the School and Vocational Guidance
Division, which writes, prints, administers, and corrects the country-wide
competitive tests for admission to secondary schools. Secondary level aptitude
tests have been developed and administered to 8th-grade primary pupils.
Nevertheless, assignment of pupils who are successful in the national
competition to the various secondary schools throughout the country is done
without reference to the aptitude-test scores. Despite this, the Ministry has
ample documentation and technical studies on the aptitude ratings of 8th grade
pupils, their reasons for desiring a secondary school education, and the
effectiveness of the testing instruments used during the course of their
schooling. Given the availability of trained personnel and the opening of more
technical and secondary teaching institutions, application of the selection
methods already studied should help to expand secondary enrollment in a
rational way.
6.10      Summary.  During implementation, failure to respect certain clauses
of the Development Credit Agreement and a succession of misunderstandings
caused a long delay in project implementation. After the disbursement freeze
was lifted in 1981, the then-completed workshops served as the cornerstone for
the reform of primary education in Rwanda. Despite successive modifications of
the measures being instituted, the Government and concerned local groups never
slackened in their efforts to construct 150, then 250, and finally 924
workshops, plus the 7th and 8th grade classrooms that go with them,
approximately 2,500 of which are now in use. In addition, approximately 304
CERAIs have been built. The fact that these new centers are available to
primary-school leavers has led to the recycling of more than 2,000 teachers and
technicians and brought several multilateral and bilateral aid institutions
into the picture. The result is that Rwanda will have the support it needs in
endeavoring to provide all children with the same schooling, a majority of them
with prevocational training, to equip them for more successful incorporation
into the economically active population. The scope of this effort and its
widespread practical effects have also given the reform movement greater
credibility, providing school workshops with a linkage to other such measures,
despite the many difficulties encountered. The national mission to evaluate
all workshops should provide a means of introducing necessary improvements in
organization, equipment, and furnishings. The linkage between the training
provided in the workshops and the CERAIs will mean more effective incorporation
of young people into the labor force, and steer them into useful activities
such as manufacturing school furniture. In addition, it established the
practice of local community financing of significant elements of the education
system. This, in the last analysis, is the only possible way to justify the
huge expenditure committed to this mode of education and to create an awareness
of the cost associated with undertaking these measures.



- 23 -
Educational Printshop
6.11      The project called for a printshop to be constructed, equipped, and
supplied with paper to enable Rwanda, in the spirit of educational reform, to
produce and distribute to its schools approximately 2.7 million textbooks and
1.6 million teachers' guides. Their content were to be designed to bring about
the adaptation and ruralization of primary instruction; in addition, these
books were meant to help children integrate their learning, since the school
year is reduced by double shifts, still practiced in almost all primary-school
cycle I classes (grades 1-3).
6.12      Equipment.  The Federal Republic of Germany and UNDP assistance
funded the units for composition/paging, production/laboratory and film
montage/printing plates.  These units are well equipped and are functioning
normally. The equipment also was set up with German and UNESCO/UNDP
assistance, which is still available. Under ideal management conditions, the
facility is capable of meeting the national goal of providing each school child
in Rwanda with books and other printed materials necessary for their proper
educational development.
6.13      Staff.  The production side of the printshop is staffed by Rwandese
who were given lengthy training in Tunisia and France. This was a result of
UNESCO/UNDP assistance, which arranged for instruction in theory and practice,
assembled the equipment the trainees needed, and showed them how to carry out
each part of the production process correctly and in sequence. Study grants
were available to Rwandese nationals wishing to improve their qualifications.
Particular attention was given to cleaning and maintaining machinery. As a
result, benches, sorters, and montage tables are cleaned regularly and floors
are washed several times a week.
6.14      The assistance provided by the Federal Republic of Germany since the
project was launched concentrated on management, accounting, and maintenance.
It was supplemented until the end of 1983 by assistance arrangements with
UNESCO/UNDP, which took part in training and in activities concerning the
various production sections and laboratories. Following the departure of
experts, the Government failed to appoint national staff to the key management
and accounting positions of the printshop, and this institution, despite all
the assistance provided, has not been a success to date.
6.15      Summary.  While the printshop operates in a reasonable manner, and
work on orders for school texts issued by the MINEPRISEC are going ahead, the
costs are not nearly competitive with the private sector. Orders from third
parties are processed routinely but the printshop was not designed for this
purpose. The facility itself has been adapted and enlarged successively to
allow for storage of the paper required to maintain normal operations. Staff
initially were well trained and have received additional training in parallel
with plant modernization. Nevertheless, there is a problem of financial
stability and profitability, although this could be remedied if the facility
were put on a commercial type of operation.

School Financing and Construction Unit (SFCS)
6.16        Established in May 1974, following negotiations between the
Government and representatives of the Bank, the SFCS has now settled into a
normal operational mode after countless difficulties and growing pains.
6.17      The main difficulty arose from the complexity of the SFCS's major
technical task, initially that of building 250, but subsequently 924 school
workshops throughout Rwanda. Complicating the matter was the participation of
an abundant supply of unspecialized personnel and the many layers of
bureaucracy that further impeded project management and timely
decision-making.
6.18      A key part of the project was to use (on a trial basis) volunteer
workers provided by the community. Actual execution of construction works
called for the participation of communes, bourgmasters, district and municipal
inspectors, and mobile teams of Rwandese on-site supervision technicians,
assisted by international volunteers and architects. This caused an enormous
management problem attributable to an overly-optimistic assessment by the
Government of the feasibility of coordinating this much activity.
6.19      Further debilitating the project were delays in recruiting
architects, associate experts, and United Nations volunteers plus the high
turnover rate among them. Finally, serious defects in accounting and
procurement resulted in an 18-month delay for the project, causing a freezing
of disbursements between 1979-1980 and a reduction of the Credit amount from
US$8 million to US$6.4 million. A progressive increase in Bank supervision
dating from 1981 did have a positive effect: it paved the way for the
successful completion of the project by providing more experienced technical
assistance personnel better able to work with similarly qualified Rwandese
nationals.
6.20      SFCS has gained credibility mostly as an architectural design
office and its services are ia demand. Its technical structure is sound, its
equipment functional, and its office premises adequate. In this area, the SFCS
has accumulated experience in implementing Capital investment projects in
education. Presently, the Second IDA-financed Education Projects, as well as
various programs financed by the Government and external donors in all parts of
the education sector, are the responsibility of SFCS. Among its Rwandese staff
are a director, an accountant, and an architect. This key group should have
been assisted with the functioning, coordination, and execution of the tasks
entrusted to the various staff and service divisions. SFCS experience includes
execution of the school workshop and printshop components as well as the steps
taken to train teachers and technicians - all in relation to the laborious
process of setting up a smoothly running Projects Implementation Unit.
6.21      Summary.  Implementation of the First Education Project has given the
Rwandese authorities not only a better understanding of physical and budgetary
constraints but also the opportunity to rationalize the timing of their
educational reform measures as follows: (a) primary school children are more
likely to receive a practical education; and (b) the quality of teaching
personnel can be continously monito-ed and improved.   Training in primary and
post-primary integrated rural education is receiving more sustained attention
by the communes and the Citizen's Bank, who together are launching activities
likely to develop and modernize the school environment and thus to strengthen
economic development.

VII. BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE
7.01      Between July 1975 and July 1983, the project had the benefit of 23
field supervision missions, and over a certain period the assistance of the
Bank's Eastern Africa Resident Mission (Nairobi) as well. The average length
of a mission was 9 days, ranging from a maximum of 25 to a minimum of 4. Out
of those 23 missions, an architect was a member of 18, a general educator of 6,
an economist of 7, and an education planner of 5. The interval between
missions varied from 1 to 7 months.
7.02      This effort represented the initial education project in Rwanda and
not unexpectedly a number of problems arose during its implementation. Despite
recommendations repeated by each supervision mission in writing and confirmed
officially by the Bank, certain conditions of the Credit Agreement were not
fully met - in particular, a failure to appoint a procurement specialist,
which early on caused some misprocurement problems. All procedures were fully
explained on several occasions by the Bank supervision mission. However, on
Bank recommendation, the Government recruited an expert accountant in 1981 who
together with SFCS staff analyzed the accounting system used for project
accounts during 1977-81. This proposed new system was implemented in 1982.
7.03      In retrospect, the decision to entrust the communes with
responsibility for workshop construction and management of the related
contracts may have been premature but reflected a reality whereby the
Government would have been unable to sustain the financial burden of building
and particularly maintaining the workshops. To be fully effective in future
projects, this approach must be supported by an administrative structure at the
national level to: (a) sustain local initiatives and efforts; (b) assist in
problem solving; and (c) assist in the allocation of resources. SFCS had been
set up expressly to serve as the Project Implementation Unit but had neither
the experience, the staff, nor the necessary authority to take on that role at
the time. This subsequently led to great confusion in project accounting and a
somewhat inferior quality of construction.   Despite the above, serious
weaknesses in the management of the SFCS remain and the thrust to establish an
implementation unit heavily slanted towards construction has left serious gaps
in accounting and also in following the educational aspects and objectives of
projects under implementation.

FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT (CREDIT 567-RW)
MISPROCUREMENT PROBLEMS
Delivery of building materials for school workshops
According to the Credit Agreement (Schedule 2, Part Al), only those
materials required for the construction of 150 workshops were to be financed
from the funds made available by the Bank. Nevertheless, on orders from the
Minister of Education, the Director of SFCS traveled to Kenya in July 1978 for
the express purpose of buying and arranging the immediate delivery in Rwanda
of materials (cement, sheet metal roofing and iron bars for reinforcing
concrete) in quantities sufficient to allow construction of 924 workshops, the
figure decided upon by the Government in the context of the education reform
launched in March 1978. Payment for these goods was made directly by the
World Bank regional office in Nairobi in accordance with Procedure III on
assurances from the Director of SFCS that IDA had approved both the quantities
ordered and method of purchasing (direct negotiation of contracts with
suppliers) - a method the Ministry of Education regarded as justified by the
urgency attaching to the building program (924 workshops, essential for
implementation of the educational reform movement, to be finished before
September 1979).
As building materials in excess of those called for by the actual
project had been ordered, paid for and supplied out of the proceeds of the
credit and as they had furthermore been obtained by methods at variance with
those stipulated in the Credit Agreement (international tenders not sought,
contracts not submitted for IDA approval), the Association, faced with a case
of misprocurement, took the following decisions (Protocol of December 5, 1978):
-    IDA would finance the purchase of the cement necessary for the
construction of 250 school workshops (instead of the 150 stipulated
in the Credit Agreement);
-    Rwanda would make funds available to the project equivalent to the
price of the excess materials purchased, and it would do so by
consenting to a reduction of 50% in the reimbursement percentages
applying to the categories of expenditure financed by IDA;
-    IDA would cancell an amount of US$130,000 allocated in the Credit
Agreement for purchase of certain materials still necessary for
construction of the remaining workshops.
School printshop paper supplies
An international call for bids for the supply of 700 tons of paper
was announced on February 15, 1979, in accordance with the World Bank's
procurement guidelines. Three foreign firms submitted tenders. The
Government awarded the contract to the firm which made the highest bid,
arguing that the other two did not meet the conditions set out in the bidding
documents. The contract was negotiated and signed before IDA had given
its approval, and in fact even before it had had an opportunity to examine the
three bids (which it did not see until six weeks after signature of the
contract by the Government).



-38 -                             Annex 9
(Page 2)
IDA took the view that the requirements for procurement under the
terms of this Credit Agreement had not been respected. since Rwanda had not
apprised it of the content of the bids lodged and the contract had been
awarded without its prior approval. Moreover, it was of the opinion that the
two lower bids had been eliminated without conclusive justification.
As the project had had earlier misprocurement problems, IDA decided
(its letter of July 1, 1980) to cancell a sum equivalent to that portion of
Credit proceeds allocated for the purchase of paper, namely US$1,491,000 (the
base amount plus percentages for contingencies and price escalation).
