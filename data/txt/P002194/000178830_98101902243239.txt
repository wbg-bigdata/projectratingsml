INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO TIE REPUBLIC OF
RWANDA FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Rwanda for the equivalent of US$8.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance an education project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Recent Economic Development and Prospects of
Rwanda" (No. 422a-RW) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
July 24, 1974. Country data are attached as Annex I.
3.        With a per capita income of about US$60, Rwanda is one of the poorest
countries in the world. It is included in the UN list of the 25 least developed
countries and has also been designated as a most severely affected country as
a result of crop failures and the increased prices of petroleum products.    It
has a rapidly growing population in a small, landlocked area, where most of
the land suitable for agriculture and livestock is already occupied. Several
areas are still infested by the tsetse fly. The average size of an agricul-
tural holding is only about 1 ha; intensive cultivation and pasturing on hill
slopes have caused considerable soil erosion. There is little prospect of
alleviating this tremendous pressure on land. The exhaustion of the land,
the scarcity of other natural resources, the rapidly growing population, the
high transportation costs to the seaboard and, above all, the lack of skilled
and trained personnel, make the task of economic development truly formidable.
4.        The share of agriculture activities in GDP declined from 76 percent
in 1964 to 63 percent in 1973. The economy is overwhelmingly rural, with
more than 90 percent of the population engaged in agriculture. About 65
percent of agricultural output is for family consumption. Unfavorable
weather and an inadequate distribution system lead to frequent scarcities.
Due to bad weather in the spring of 1974, the price of basic foodstuffs
(bananas, beans, potatoes) increased substantially and near famine conditions
prevailed in the North, which is the most populated part of the country.
Coffee is the main cash crop, accounting for about 50 percent of commodity
exports and 20 percent of government revenues. The Government has sought to
alleviate the dependence on coffee exports by encouraging tea and pyrethrum
production. Coffee, tea and pyrethrum, cassiterite and wolfram, account for
95 percent of total exports. Industrial production and construction activities
have increased substantially since 1964, but mining has stagnated.



5.        The political and social turmoil that accompanied independence
in 1962 resulted in a 20-30 percent decline of GDP in the early 60's. Between
1964 and 1970, GDP increased by 60 percent in real terms, but during the same
period, the population grew by 22 percent. Between 1970-72 the economy
stagnated, but in 1973 the growth resumed at an annual rate of about 4
percent. The present average standard of living is not significantly above
the preindependence level. Although few statistics are available, the
general impression is that income distribution is fairly even. The level of
savings is low. In 1973 gross capital formation amounted to 10 percent of
GDP, rising by 9 percent per year between 1969 and 1973. Public sector
investment accounted for about half of the total. Some 70 percent of public
investment was for basic infrastructure, and 15 percent for agriculture.
6.        The first development plan of Rwanda, prepared in 1970, did not
succeed in preventing the economic stagnation of the early 1970's. A new
plan for 1976-81 is under preparation. The main development constraints to be
faced are lack of skilled manpower and natural resources, high transportation
costs and the small size of the domestic market. In the near future, manpower
is the only constraint which can be eased through a program of technical and
management training and, where necessary, by recruiting foreign skilled
manpower. In the rural areas much of the effort will be focused on an
integrated approach to agriculture, whereby policies aiming at an increase
in subsistence production would have to be combined with efforts to increase
export production. Only by achieving higher yields for subsistence crops
will it be possible to release some of the land and resources for increasing
the production of cash crops and livestock.
7.        The physical constraints to development are presently being com-
pounded by financial difficulties in the balance of payments. In particular,
the combined payments for food and petroleum products almost doubled from
US$4.7 million in 1973 to US$8.8 million in 1974. Export prices are expected
to decline in 1975, while imports would rise substantially as a result in part
of increasing public consumption and in part of further rises in import prices
As foreign exchange reserves would not be sufficient to meet the deficit, now
expected at US$15 million, the Government is considering the introduction of
either higher tariffs or controls to limit imports. Rwanda would also have
access to US$1.5 million under the IMF oil facility, and has a Fund Quota of
about US$24 million.
8.        Over the course of the next 5 years, even with increased effort,
Rwanda's gross domestic product is unlikely to increase by more than 5 per-
cent annually. Nevertheless the growth of GDP will permit some expansion of
the tax base, which should enable an increasing share of current expenditure
to be met by government revenues. Although the marginal savings rate over
the 1975-80 period could be close to 10 percent, as compared to an average
rate in 1973 of about 5 percedat, domestic resources would still only finance
40 percent of investment in 1980, and external capital inflows would be
required to finance the balance.



-3 -
9.        According to Government estimates, external assistance financed about
80 percent of the public investment in 1968-72. In addition to its contribution
to financing investment, external assistance also financed a substantial part
of current public expenditure. Rwanda has also benefitted from substantial
foreign technical assistance estimated at about $10 million a year between
1969 and 1972, including scholarships. Total commitments of external assistance
increased from $15.5 million in 1969 to $25 million in 1972. All of the 540
technical assistance personnel working in Rwanda in 1972 were financed by
grants from bilateral sources or international organizations. The education
sector alone absorbed nearly half of all technical assistance, followed by
agriculture (20 percent) and health.
10.       At the end of 1973, Rwanda's external debt (disbursed and out-
standing) amounted to about $8.3 million, of which IDA accounted for $3.7
million or 45 percent. Most of the assistance to Rwanda has been in the form
of grants. Since 1973, in addition to a $6.3 million IDA credit, the Govern-
ment contracted about $6.5 million in loans at very concessionary rates,
mainly from Arab countries. Debt service ratio is low (under 2 percent in
1974) but in view of the country's poverty, limited export potential and vul-
nerability to price fluctuations, external assistance would have to continue
in grant form or on concessionary terms. Furthermore, because of lack of
development capital, foreign assistance should continue to finance a very
substantial part of the total cost of projects including a considerable por-
tion of local costs.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN RWANDA
11.       Bank Group assistance, which started in 1970, has so far focused
primarily on the improvement of the road sector on which the country is
almost entirely dependent for the movement of its domestic and foreign trade.
Three IDA credits, totaling $18.6 million, have been made for that purpose.
In addition, a credit of $3.8 million was extended in 1973 for an agricultural
development project. There have been no Bank loans or IFC investments. Annex
II contains a summary statement of IDA credits as of April 30, 1975 and notes
on the execution of ongoing projects.
12.       As described in Annex II, all four projects are facing difficulties
in their e'xecution. The situation is particularly serious with respect to the
First Highway Project which provides for the construction of a road from
Kigali, the country's capital, to Gatuna at the border of Uganda, and for
which a credit of $9.3 million was made in June 1970. This project has been
co-financed by Belgium. For various reasons described in more detail in
Annex II, substantial cost overruns have occurred and the Government has
requested the Association to make additional financing available. Since the
other two highway projects are also experiencing difficulties, we are presently
making a reappraisal of all three projects. Consultations    are also taking place
with the UNDP, Belgium and Germany to achieve closer coordination with respect
to technical assistance in the nighway sector.    Attempts to obtain additional
financing from other sources have so far been unsuccessful, but discussions



-4-
in this respect are continuing, particularly with Germany. The execution of
the agricultural development project in the Mutara region is also being affected
by cost increases, mainly due to the delay in starting the project resulting from
difficulties in selecting a suitable consulting firm. A review of the project
will be carried out in the near future, taking into account, among other things,
proposed plans to execute drairtage and irrigation works in the project area thlat
may necessitate changes in some of the project's components.
13.       In the future, we intend to continue in the first place to pay
very close attention to the execution of ongoing projects. Because of the
lack of skilled manpower and expertise in Rwanda, this will require substan-
tial input of Bank Group staff and foreign experts. As technical assistance
is being provided by various sources, we also intend to pursue our efforts to
improve cooperation and coordination among the aid agencies active in Rwanda.
With respect to new operations, we intend to place primary emphasis on agricul-
ture while continuing our support to the highway and education sectors. Two
agricultural projects are currently being appraised. The first one would
assist the Government in developing cinchona plantations which should help
Rwanda diversify its exports. The project would also provide for a strength-
ening of extension services for coffee growers and a modest soil conservation
program. The project would aim at improving the standard of living of nearly
50,000 families. The second project would consist of a rural development
program based on the improvement of livestock and foodcrop production and aim
at the settlement of about 11,000 families in the south-east of Rwanda. This
project would also provide for the eradication of the tsetse fly in that
area. All future projects are expected to include substantial components of
technical assistance.
PART III - EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN RWANDA
14.       Present education in Rwanda has basically a western European struc-
ture. Primary education is of six years duration, starting from age seven,
followed by 6-7 years of secondary education which includes technical-vocational
courses at both lower and upper secondary level, and by 3-7 year courses at
post-secondary and university levels. The system is marked by wide contrasts
between the primary and secondary levels. Primary education generally takes
place in inadequate facilities where basic materials, such as textbooks and
furniture, are often lacking. On the other hand, largely because of the
interest shown by missionaries and external aid agencies, facilities for
secondary schools are of a reasonable standard. The classroom loading of
primary schools and their student-teacher ratio (51 to 1), are high, whereas
secondary schools are underutilized with an uneconomical student-teacher
ratio of less than 13 students per teacher.



-5-
15.       Primary education is both compulsory and free.     Enrollments in
primary schools increased by 69 percent between 1961-62 and 1972-73 and
reached 400,000 pupils or 52 percent of the 7-12 age group in 1972-73.
However, drop-out and repetition rates, although decreasing in recent years,
are still high. Numerous small schools have only one or two classrooms.
Although efforts have been made to improve primary teacher qualifications,
only 40 percent of the teachers are presently fully qualified by the Govern-
ment's own standards. Teaching aids are lacking, and student textbooks do not
exist, except for a limited number of new textbooks printed in the national
language, Kinyarwanda, for the first three grades. Workshops for the newly
introduced practical subjects are non-existent. These weaknesses have arisen
in part because the Government is not itself involved in school construction,
leaving 'primary school building to the initiative of local groups who, often,
have inadequate resources and expertise to construct and equip simple but
functional schools. Primary education, which is terminal for nearly all
children, should provide courses designed to prepare school leavers for a
productive life; yet, emphasis is still on preparation for entry into secondary
schools where only 2 percent of the relevant age group are enrolled, and these
are mainly prepared for employment in the modern sector.
16.       Some measures have been taken to meet the needs of those who have
no access to secondary education. A number of small schools for girls have
been created, providing practical training for about 5,000 in 3-year post-
primary courses. A similar form of practical training for boys has been
initiated with the establishment of Centres d'Education Rurale et Artisanale;
in 1972/73 there were ten with an enrollment of about 600. These post-primary
programs, although they provide a useful training, have to compete with the
primary system for scarce funds which will limit their future growth.
17.       The secondary educational system offers a multitude of programs of
varying lengths at varying levels. Like the higher educational system, it has
suffered from a lack of coordination and cohesion in the programs resulting
from the wide diversity of the sources of foreign aid, over which the Govern-
ment exercises little control. Enrollments in general secondary education
have grown slowly (about 24 percent over seven years) while enrollments
in teacher training institutions have been virtually unchanged. Total
enrollments amounted to 10,500 in 1973/74, or about 2 percent of the age
group. With a pupil-teacher ratio of about 13:1, enrollments could be in-
creased without increasing the number of teaching staff. Curricula, which
are too much related to a western European environment do not meet Rwanda's
development needs.
18.       Higher education is given at the National University (humanities,
science, economics, medicine, nursing and law), the National Pedagogical
Institute (training of secondary education teachers) and the "Grand Seminaire"
(priesthood). At the University, agricultural courses are lacking. Medicine
is the most developed field with enrollments reaching 43 percent of the
total number of university students.



-6-
19.       An important part of the Government's budget is spent on education.
In 1974, recurrent expenditures for education amounted to about 29 percent
of total government recurrent expenditures. More than 65 percent of the edu-
cation budget was spent on primary education, almost all to meet teachers'
salaries. In addition, the building of primary schools is generally carried
out by local groups and municipalities (communes). Furthermore, foreign aid
to education is almost as high as the budget of the Ministry of Education
(although figures for external assistance to education are artificially
inflated by the high cost of expatriate teachers). In fact, some twenty mul-
tilateral and bilateral aid agencies are involved in the development of
Rwanda's educational system and finance a substantial part of the capital and
recurrent expenditures for secondary, technical and higher education. However,
since foreign aid schemes are uncoordinated and no government plan had so far
been available to set priorities in the framework of national objectives,
developments have escaped effective Government control and are often unneces-
sarily expensive and not always geared to the country's needs. More effective
government control of the secondary and higher educational system to improve
planning and coordination of all external assistance is now urgently needed
and through rationalization of important cost savings could be achieved.
20.       In order to improve efficiency and thereby reduce, in the long run,
the cost of education to the economy, the Ministry of Education in 1974
proposed a fundamental reform of primary education. Under the proposal,
primary education would provide a four-year basic course of general education
for all children, given in the local language, Kinyarwanda. After a selection
based on aptitudes, 90 percent-of the children would receive a two-year
terminal course with half the time being devoted to practical subjects
related to agriculture to prepare them for immediate employment after school.
The remaining 10 percent would have a two-year pre-secondary course emphasiz-
ing French, the medium of instruction of secondary schools. The primary
school entrance age would be 9 or 10 years so that upon graduation at 15 or
16 the children can directly join the labor force. Secondary and higher
education would be more related to the manpower requirements of the economy
and entry into the secondary would be based on competitive examinations. At
the university level, the same principles would prevail. The proposed reform
has been discussed by an Education Commission, but some of its measures, in
particular the proposal to raise the age of entry into primary schools to 9
or 10 years, have met with opposition. The age of entry into primary school
is however being raised to eight in the school year 1975-76 and more impor-
tantly, the Commission agreed that practical subjects should be introduced
into primary education and a beginning with this was made for the year 1974-
75.  The Government has requested the UNDP for technical assistance to review
the reform proposals and the needed improvements and to help prepare syllabi
and long-term planning for education. The UNDP is expected to commence this
assistance in the course of 19g5 and to formulate a detailed program by 1977-
78.



-7-
21.       Any comprehensive investment program should await the final de-
cision on the reform proposals, but this should not delay a start on urgently
needed improvements. In particular, the existing primary school facilities
are inadequate for instruction in practical subjects, and textbooks are
lacking. Investments in secondary and higher level education should be made
only after manpower needs have been defined and the existing system rationalized.
A phased approach is thus required, with the first phase concentrating on im-
provements in primary education, which will be of high priority whatever long-
term educational strategy is adopted. The improvements of the first stage
would include the development of more relevant and productive primary school
programs, particularly for rurally oriented practical subjects, the promotion
of the use of Kinyarwanda as the medium of instruction, and the reorientation
of studies to fit local traditions and needs.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
22.       The proposed project reflects the gradual approach outlined in
paragraph 21 and would help the Rwandese Government in improving the quality
and efficiency of primary education. The project has been prepared by the
Ministry of Education with assistance from UNESCO and the Association. It
was appraised in September 1974, and a post appraisal mission visited Rwanda
in November 1974. A credit and project summary is given in Annex III. The
appraisal report (Appraisal of an Education Project in Rwanda, Report No.759-RW)
is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors. Negotiations for
the proposed credit were held in Kigali in April, 1975. The Rwandese delega-
tion was led by H. E. Thaddee Bagaragaza, Minister of National Education.
23.       The project would consist of:
(a) construction, furnishing and equipping of approximately 150
workshops for teaching practical subjects with about 6,000
student places;
(b) construction, furnishing and equipping of a print shop and
the provision of paper for the production and distribution
of about 2.7 million textbooks and 1.6 million student guides;
(c) construction and equipping of an office building for a School
Financing and Construction Unit (SFCU).; and
(d) technical assistance for project implementation (44 man-years)
and for evaluation of construction methods, financing mechanisms
and selection/examination procedures for secondary education
(4 man-years).



- 8 -
24.       Each of the 150 workshops to be provided would have facilities to
teach 40 students in agriculture-related woodwork, metalwork and home economics
which are relevant to the students' rural environment. The workshops, which
would be adjacent to primary schools, would also be used for training adults
after school hours and during vacations. The 6,000 student places to be
provided in the workshops would allow about one fourth of all primary school
students to receive instruction in practical subjects. Some teachers have
prepared to give instruction in practical subjects and the Government has made
satisfactory arrangements for in-service training of practicing primary school
teachers in the new programs of studies. Should the schools to which workshops
would be attached not be of adequate standard, they would be improved with
the technical assistance of the SFCU. The workshops would be built to a
standard pattern. Appropriate local materials would be used in construction
to the greatest extent possible and the communes would be actively engaged
in the works. It is essential that the workshops provide simple but adequate
facilities at minimum cost. The proposed construction methods should help
establish a program of economical and efficient school building in Rwanda
and form a possible basis for further Bank Group assistance at a later stage.
25.       Textbooks are needed to make learning in primary schools more
effective. At present, only a few textbooks for teaching Kinyarwanda in the
three first grades are available and have been introduced successfully in
some schools. For the other main subjects of primary education (mathematics,
environmental studies, practical subjects, and French as a foreign language)
textbooks and student guides are still to be prepared. Manuscripts for
mathematics books have been prepared while syllabi for environmental studies
and practical subjects are being finalized and will be revised as experience
is gained. Since the textbooks and student guides are to be printed in the
local language, the Government proposed that this be done in Rwanda. As the
existing printing facilities in Rwanda are insufficient to meet these needs,
the project would provide for the construction and equipment of a printing
center including two offset machines, a paper-sorting machine, two typesetting
machines, furniture and paper.
26.       The project would provide for 48 man-years of specialists, including
field staff to assist in general project administration and implementation.
The field staff would supervise and provide technical advice to local crafts-
men at the various construction sites. Counterparts to the technical assist-
ance personnel would be appointed for training by,and later replacement of,
expatriates. Evaluation of the performance with respect to construction
methods and implementation would also take place during project implementation.
Four man-years of consultants' services would be provided under the project
for this purpose. In addition, various aid agencies are expected to provide
technical assistance to help the Ministry of Planning carry out a manpower
survey of the modern sector, aad to help the Ministry of Education establish
equitable methods for selection/examination of students for secondary
education and analyze the present secondary and higher education system
with a view to making it more effective and economical.



-9-
Project Implementation
27.       To facilitate the execution of the project and as a means toward
improved planning in school design and construction methods, a School Financing
and Construction Unit (SFCU) has been established within the Ministry of Edu-
cation which would have the overall responsibility for project implementation
including liaison with the other Ministries and local authorities. The senior
staff of the Unit, consisting of a director, an architect (a civil engineer),
a procurement officer and an accountant would be appointed after consultation
with the Association on their qualifications, terms of reference and conditions
of employment. The director, a Rwandese national, has been appointed. The
accountant will likewise be Rwandese but due to the lack of local experienced
specialists, it is likely that the architect and the procurement officer will
have to be recruited internationally. The project would provide for the con-
struction and equipment of the offices of the SFCU including 10 vehicles to
facilitate transportation throughout Rwanda.
28.       Special procedures for design, management and supervision of work-
shop construction have been developed by the SFCU to encourage community
participation and promote low cost construction. While responsibility for
construction would be at the local level (communes), the SFCU would assist
these local efforts with administrative and technical advice and the provision
of some material. One of the main criteria in the selection of workshop
sites would be the readiness of the local authority to provide self-help for
site preparation and construction work. Standard designs developed by the
SFCU may be modified by the communes to take account of local conditions.
At the individual sites, construction would be carried out either by separate
contracts or direct management of field teams. Supervision of construction
would be undertaken by the bourgmaster himself, in his capacity of legal
representative of the commune, with the assistance of the provincial inspector
and the district inspector as well as the field staff of the SFCU. Before
final acceptance of the works, the SFCU field staff would inspect each work-
shop.
29.       To facilitate the payment procedure, a revolving fund will be
established with the National Bank in the name of the SFCU (Section 3.01 of
the Draft Development Credit Agreement). The SFCU would, out of the fund,
advance the necessary funds to the communes to meet mobilization expenditures,
and as the construction gets underway the communes would be reimbursed on a
monthly basis for expenditures incurred. Materials and equipment procured in
bulk by SFCU would likewise be. paid out of the fund. The revolving fund was
created in early May, but a few administrative formalities for its establish-
ment remain to be completed. These as well as the payment into the fund of
an initial contribution equivalent to $100,000 by the Government have been
set as conditions of credit effectiveness (Section 6.01 of the Draft Develop-
ment Credit Agreement.) The Government has agreed to replenish the fund
periodically to at least that amount throughout the execution period of the
project. All disbursements by IDA, except when payments are made directly to
suppliers, would be made into the fund.



- 10 -
30.       Because of our general experience with other Bank Group financed
projects in Rwanda, the period of execution of the project has been conser-
vatively estimated at 6-1/2 years from the date of effectiveness. However,
since the Government is determined to implement the reform of its educational
system as soon as possible, a more rapid performance may be achieved.
Project Costs and Financing
31.       The total cost of the project, including taxes and duties of about
US$200,000, is estimated at US$9.0 million equivalent with a foreign exchange
component of US$6.2 million, or 70 percent of total net project costs. The
proposed IDA credit of US$8.0 million would finance 90 percent of total net
project costs, covering US$6.2 million foreign exchange cost and US$1.8
million of local expenditures. The Government of Rwanda would finance the
remaining costs.   The allocation of costs is as follows:
US$   millions
1.   Civil works                          1.63
2.   Furniture and instructional
equipment                         0.75
3.   Printing equipment and
paper                             1.30
4.   Technical assistance                 0.96
5.   Project administration
and consultant
services                         0.60
6.   Physical contingencies and
expected price increases          3.76
Total               9.00
The recurrent expenditures resulting from the project are expected to re-
present about 5.7 percent of the recurrent expenditures (exclusive of those
financed by foreign aid) anticipated by the Ministry of Education for 1981 and
could be met from the Ministry's ordinary budget.
32.       As stated in paragraph 19 above, a number of aid agencies are
providing assistance in the education sector    and some may be prepared to
finance certain items presently included in t?he project (printing equip-
ment, paper, technical assistance). Should this occur, corresponding savings
under the proposed credit would be used for the construction and equipment
of additional workshops or the upgrading of primary schools.



Procurement
33.       Neither foreign nor local contractors are likely to be interested
in bidding for the construction of the small, simple and often remotely
located workshops. Procurement procedures have therefore been designed to
tailor civil works for the construction of these workshops to local condi-
tions which would facilitate the execution of the 1project and achieve
economies. The communes would be responsible for procuring most of the
materials (e.g., bricks) and for providing skilled and unskilled labor.
Self-help would be employed to prepare the sites. Building materials avail-
able locally and suitable for purchases in bulk (e.g., cement) would be
procured by the SFCU following local competitive bidding or the solicitation
of competitive offers from local suppliers. Building materials not available
locally, as well as instructional equipment, furniture and vehicles (represent-
ing about $1.6 million) would be procured after advertisement in the local
press and in adjacent countries. Civil works for the SFCU offices and the
print shop would be advertised locally. Printing equipment and paper (about
$1.3 million) would be procured after international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank Group guidelines. The above procedures are acceptable
to the Association.
Disbursements
34.       Disbursements would be on the basis of:
(a) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for all goods procured
outside Rwanda;
(b) 75 percent of total expenditures for locally procured
furniture, instructional equipment and vehicles and 85
percent for locally procured construction materials, labor
and civil works by contractors; and
(c) 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 85 percent of local
expenditures for technical assistance services and 90 percent
of total expenditures for local salaries and operating costs
of SFCU.
Retroactive financing for an amount not exceeding US$30,000 is proposed to
cover expenses incurred since March 30, 1975 for preparatory work. Any funds
remaining in the credit at completion of the project would be used for the
construction of additional workshops or primary schools.
Benefits and Justification
35.       Increasing agricultural productivity in Rwanda is an urgent necessity
in view of the growing population and the scarcity of land. In this effort,
the education system can play an important role by providing the required
skills. At present, it is ill-equipped to meet this objective. The proposed
project would help improve the quality of primary education and the productivity



- 12 -
of new entrants into rural life through appropriate training.   The workshops
would allow one fourth of the primary student body to receive appropriate
instruction in rurally oriented subjects.   The methods of construction proposed
would help increase the skills of local craftsmen through on the job training,
and the proposed financial mechanisms would facilitate the channeling of funds
from the central Government to local authorities. The SFCU is expected to
become a permanent institution, which would eventually be responsible for all
expansion of educational facilities in Rwanda, and would give the Government
greater control of educational planning and development.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
36.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Rwanda and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for
under Article V, Section I (d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of
a resolution approving the proposed Credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
37.       Features of the draft Development Credit Agreement of special
interest dealing with the establishment of the School Financing and Construc-
tion Unit and the appointment of its senior staff are referred to in
paragraph 27 of this report. As described in paragraph 29, the com-
pletion of the administrative formalities for the establishment of the
revolving fund and the payment into it of an initial contribution of
US$100,000 equivalent by the Government, have been set as an additional
condition of credit effectiveness (Section 6.01 of the draft Development
Credit Agreement).
38.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
39.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit No. 196-RW   Kigali-Gatuna Highway Project:   $9.3 million of June 11,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
A number of serious problems have hampered the execution
of the project. Substantial delays have occurred because of
poor detailed engineering and a gross under-estimation of
quantities. Unforeseen geo-technical and hydrological
problems have been encountered as the work proceeded,
requiring a number of changes in design. Delays in
supplies, particularly cement, resulting from transport
difficulties, and general price increases and currency
realignments have aggravated-the situation. While
construction of 64 km of the road is almost complete, work
on the last 20 km has not started yet. The total cost of
the road, including the construction of the last 20 km,
which was assessed by independent consultants recently
engaged by the Government, has been estimated at about
US$17 million excluding contingencies, as compared to
US$7.7 million at the time of appraisal. The Government
will be unable to finance the extra costs and has requested
the Association for a supplementary credit. Attempts are
being made to secure additional financing from other (multi-
lateral and bilateral) sources.
Credit No. 299-RW    Highway Maintenance Pro_ect:   $3 million of March 31,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Execution of the project has encountered several difficulties.
The procurement of equipment was delayed and as a result
contracts were awarded at higher costs than estimated at
appraisal. In addition, low wages for local skilled personnel
has hampered recruitment and training of an efficient mainte-
nance organization. Lack of Government funds has also inter-
rupted maintenance work. The Government is considering steps
to allocate more funds for road maintenance and to strengthen
its organization.
Credit No. 439-RW   Agricultural Development Project:   $3.8 million of
November 29, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Project execution began September 1974 about a year behind
schedule because of delays in selecting a suitable consulting
firm to assist in project execution. Preparations are now
underway for the establishment of paysannats and grazing

ranches, settlement of farmers and the eradication of the
tsetse fly in the project area, but substantial cost increases
are anticipated. In addition the Government, with assistance
from Canada, is considering a drainage and irrigation
program in the project area which may necessitate some
changes in some of the project components. A review
of the project, taking these factors into account, will
be carried out in the near future.
Credit No. 475-RW    Ruhengeri-Gisenyi Road Construction (Third Highway)
Project $6.3 million of September 15, 1974; Closing
Date: June 30, 1977
The start of construction had to be postponed for about
4 months to permit the supervising consultants to complete
detailed engineering. Work is now underway, progress is
satisfactory and present indications are that the total cost
of construction will be within estimates. A formal training
program for highway personnel is being prepared and is
expected to be carried out with UNDP financing.
