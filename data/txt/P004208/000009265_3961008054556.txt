MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IDA TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE LAO PEOPLE'S
DEMOCRATIC RE,PUBLIC FOR A LAND TITLING PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed credit to the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic for SDR 14.0 million (US$20.7 million
equivalent) to help finance a Land Titling Project. The proposed credit would be on standard
IDA terms, with a maturity of 40 years.
Country and Sector Background
2.    Since the mid- 1 980s, the Lao economy has been in transition from a centrally planned to
a market-based economy. An important part of the transition has been to develop markets
including markets for land based on clear and enforceable land use rights that could facilitate
private investment, enable landholders to use land as collateral for bank loans and encourage
sustainable use of land. The Government has undertaken a series of policy and legal steps to
provide a necessary framework for use of land by individuals and organizations under a market
system. First, the Property Law (No. 1/1990 of June 1990) granted land ownership to the
National Community, represented by the state, which may grant to individuals, economic units
and organizations the right of control, use, transfer and inheritance of land. Secon, the
Constitution, adopted on August 14, 1991, confirmed these rights. Third, on December 19, 1992,
the Government issued a land decree on ownership and permissible uses of land (Decree No.
99/PM) which defines the rights of the state in relation to land ownership and the principles to
guide its allocation and use. In addition to the rights described above, citizens now could pledge
their land use rights as collateral for loans. Non-resident aliens and non-citizens who have made
investments in Lao PDR may obtain usage rights through leases and concessions.
3.    The Department of Lands and Housing Management (DOLHM) was given the
responsibility of managing land and housing through the decree on the Organization of the
Ministry of Finance No. 104 PM of July 6, 1993. Also, a high-level Land Re-Management
Committee was established, which is chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister and uses DOLHM as
its secretariat. The primary responsibility of the Committee is to spearhead efforts to implement
the land decree of December 1992. Soon after the decree was issued, various provinces started
issuing titles but in a limited and uncoordinated manner. For example, Savannakhet province has
issued 2,400 titles. In 1994, the Land Re-management Committee launched a Pilot Project in
Vientiane Prefecture aimed at issuing titles in a more orderly and efficient manner. In the Pilot,
only about 10 percent of the target number of parcels could be issued titles because 50 percent of
the parcels did not have any documentary evidence of land possession and about 30 percent had
only unregistered documents. By comparison, a 40 percent registration rate has been achieved in
Savannakhet province; previous successful land titling projects in other countries were able to
title about 80 percent of the parcels. The problem of lack of documentary evidence is a real one
since, of an estimated 1.6 million parcels in Lao PDR, less than 10 percent of landholders have
documentary evidence of their rights, with most relying on village systems and possession. To
address the problem, the Government has decided to accept non-documentary evidence of land
possession, and launched in July 1995 a Second Pilot Project to test the new procedures of land



-2 -
registration ahead of the project. The results of the Pilot, which was completed in February
1996, indicate a high registration rate of more than 80 percent (see paras. 16-17).
4.    With a most basic legal framework in place and operational trials under way, the next
important step is development of the institutional capacity and the necessary infrastructure to
effectively implement the existing land regulations and help the Government develop a
comprehensive land legislation. However, existing resources and experience are very limited.
Hence the main purpose of the proposed Project would be to support the efforts of Lao PDR to
build a strong capacity for an effective land management and administration system.
Project Objectives
5.    The overall goal of the project is to strengthen the basis for long term sustainable
economic and social development. In conformity with this goal, the project objectives are to
foster the development of efficient land markets and to facilitate domestic resource mobilization
by providing a system of clear and enforceable land use rights and developing a land valuation
capacity.
Project Description
6.    The project would support the first seven years of a longer term national land titling
program (which would be developed during implementation) aimed at extending secure land use
rights including developing land administration and valuation systems and establishing a
cadastral mapping system. The main components of the project are: (i) strengthening of the
policy and legal framework for land management and administration (US$0.4 million); (ii)
implementation of an accelerated land titling program (US$19.9 million including US$4.0
million for base mapping, US$15.2 million for systematic registration and US$0.7 million for
registration on individual demand basis); (iii) improvements in the infrastructure, facilities and
systems for land administration (US$2.7 million); (iv) improvements in land valuation (US$0.8
million); (v) support for project management and implementation, and institutional strengthening
(US$4.0 million); and (vi) studies covering among other topics: community land tenure and
registration, definition of forest boundaries, cost recovery, efficiency and land rights issues on
nationalized lands, and the socio-economic impact of land titling (US$0.6 million). A large
proportion of the total project costs (about 45 percent) relate to investments in the policy and
legal framework, institutional and physical infrastructure, and capacity building that would
support a longer term program of land titling and administration that goes beyond the project's
time frame; the remaining expenditures relate directly to the immediate production of land titles
which are the primary output of the project.
7.    The total cost of the project is estimated at US$28.4 million equivalent, with foreign
exchange cost totaling about 60 percent. The IDA credit of US$20.7 million would finance
about 72.8 percent of foreign costs and about 73.5 percent of local costs. The Australian Agency
for International Development (AusAID) would contribute a grant equivalent to US$5.1 million
to finance technical assistance (TA), and the balance would be funded by the Government of Lao
PDR. A breakdown of the costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in



- 3 -
Schedule B. A timetable of the project processing events and the status of the Association's
operations in Lao PDR are given in Schedule C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report No. 14902-LA, dated February 21, 1996 is being distributed separately.
Project Implementation
8.    The project would be implemented by the Department of Lands and Housing Management
(DOLHM) under the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The Director of DOLHM will act as Project
Director, supported by a Project Support Unit (PSU) whose establishment has been initiated as
part of the pre-implementation activities being funded under an Australian Trust Fund (No.
TF020287; A$1 million). The Project Director would contract the services of a Project
Administrator (PA) who would handle administration responsibilities including procurement,
financial payments, and project monitoring during the first three years of the project. At the
provincial level, the project's activities would be managed through the Land and Housing
Management Offices of the Finance Division.
9.    A Project Steering Committee (PSC) will be formed under the chairmanship of the Vice
Minister of Finance. Its members will include representatives at the level of chief of cabinet of the
Ministries of Finance, Justice, Ministry of Communication, Transport, Posts and Construction
and Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; representatives of the Prime Minister's Office, the
Prefecture of Vientiane and of the provinces covered under the Project; and the Project Director.
DOLHM will serve as the secretariat to the PSC. The steering committee would be responsible
for overall project supervision and coordination, including the approval of annual workplans and
budgets and the review of semi-annual progress reports. It would also act as a link to the Land
Re-Management Committee for advice on policy decisions impacting the implementation of the
project. At each province, there would be a Provincial Oversight Committee chaired by the Vice-
Governor (for Development) and including representatives from relevant provincial agencies to
coordinate project implementation.
Project Sustainability
10.   Four key actions are helping to ensure project sustainability. First, the project would
support the development of institutional and human resource capacity which would enable Lao
PDR to carry out land administration after project completion; in particular, the project's support
for land administration would help build a capacity to manage title transfers on an on-going basis
once properties are registered in the land offices. Second, the financial viability of land
administration will be improved through increased government revenues which will be generated
from the taxation of land transactions; the first phase of the project would focus on the most
economically active areas of the country which also happen to be areas of high revenue potential.
A special study would be conducted, under the project, to review the fee structure of land
administration with a focus on the affordability of land transactions, the incentive to use formal
rather than informal land registration procedures, and the recovery of the full cost of land
administration. Third, the public sector would manage the issuing of titles and the entire project
in its last four years, contribute nearly half of the personnel undertaking land adjudication work,
and work with the contractors at the local government and agency level in many of the project
activities. And fourth, project preparation has involved a series of participatory and interactive



- 4 -
and work with the contractors at the local government and agency level in many of the project
activities. And fQouth, project preparation has involved a series of participatory and interactive
workshops with participation of stakeholders at the national, provincial and district levels in
project design with a view to fostering local ownership of the project.
Lessons Learnt from Previous IDA/Bank Involvement
11.   This would be IDA's first land administration project in Lao PDR. However, IDA has
supported projects in the agricultural and natural resources sector. Performance of these projects
has been largely unsatisfactory due to inappropriate macro and sectoral policies, weak
institutions, and a poor human resource and infrastructure base. While policy actions and
investments have significantly reduced these impediments during the last ten years, a shortage of
skilled personnel is still a major constraint to project management and implementation.
12.   The Bank's experience with land titling projects world-wide has been mixed: success has
been recorded primarily in the Thailand projects but the results in most of the other projects have
been less satisfactory. The key lessons drawn from Bank experience with land titling projects
point to the following factors to enhance project success. Elia, the project design should be
simple, with only a few clear objectives, and with one single implementing agency which has
well functioning management links at the provincial and/or regional level. Second, projects
should be designed on the basis of the borrower's existing human skills and institutional
capacity, which may need to be strengthened through training and to be complemented by
internationally contracted personnel and services. Third, projects should focus on existing land
rights, and not attempt to also address the reallocation of existing land rights.
13.   The above lessons have been incorporated in project design in three ways. First, a simple
project design has been followed, with the project objectives limited to land titling and valuation,
and with one lead agency responsible for project implementation. Second, in order to overcome
human resource problems and lack of experience in project implementation, the project has been
preceded by grant funding in support of pre-implementation activities including a land titling
pilot, project management training, development of a legal and policy framework, and technical
assistance. In addition, significant emphasis is given to use of private contracting (domestic and
international) to overcome human resource constraints in project management and
implementation, through ensuring continuous cooperation with the public sector, work with local
government officials and training of counterparts to ensure sustainability. Third, the project
focuses on registration of existing rights, and does not attempt to address land reform issues.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
14.   The Country Assistance Strategy for Lao PDR (dated January 18, 1996 and discussed by
the Bank's Board of Executive Directors on February 22, 1996) lists poverty alleviation and the
general improvement of the standard of living for the Lao people as its objectives. Economic
growth, which is a necessary condition for poverty alleviation, requires that the appropriate
economic infrastructure and enabling environment for private investment be in place. The lack
of land markets poses a problem for domestic and foreign investors. The country assistance
strategy highlights the importance of alleviating the present uncertainties associated with the lack



-5-
of clear titles and recording of land transactions in order to create an enabling environment for
economic growth.
15.   IDA involvement in the project has been guided by two principles: comparative
advantage, and partnership with Government and other donors. The Bank has considerable
experience in supporting land titling projects (see paras. 11 and 12) and is therefore well
positioned to support the proposed project. Furthermore, the Bank has, in partnership with
AusAID, supported successful land titling projects in Thailand and Indonesia, and this
partnership, in the form of co-financing, will continue in the proposed project. The project itself
has evolved out of the dialogue between the Government and donors in the framework of
supporting the country's transition from a centrally planned to a market economy. Support for
the development of efficient land markets is included as a priority activity in the country's Public
Investment Program to the Year 2000.
Key Issues and Actions
16.   A key issue has been the low rate of land registration due to a lack of documentary
evidence of land ownership. The nature and magnitude of this issue has become evident in the
above mentioned Pilot Land Titling Project in Vientiane Municipality (para. 3). In order to
achieve registration rates comparable to a successful land titling program (e.g., the Thailand
Land Titling Project achieved a 79 percent registration rate), the Government has decided to: (i)
allow the use of less demanding standards of evidence of land possession including
consideration for non-documentary evidence; and (ii) issue provisional titles, in cases of
insufficient evidence, which will automatically mature into full land use rights if no successful
challenge has been made against the titles.
17.   A Ministerial Instruction was issued on September 27, 1995 on new procedures for land
registration to reflect the above policy decisions including provisions for: (i) the empowerment
of systematic adjudication teams; (ii) the regulation of the issuance of titles; and (iii) the issuance
of provisional titles. The Ministerial Instruction has been used to guide the testing of new
procedures of land registration under the Second Pilot Land Titling Project which commenced in
July 1995 and ended in February 1996. Under the Pilot, a registration rate of more than 80
percent was achieved which compares favorably with the successful land titling programs.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Government would, by September 30,
1996, review jointly with IDA the results of these operational trials and would incorporate the
lessons in the Implementing Regulations to the land-related decrees which would be adopted by
January 31, 1997.
18.   The other set of issues relates to the Government's limited capacity to manage and
implement the project. Eirst, the implementing agency lacks trained people and experience to
manage the project. Second, there is a shortage of staff to implement the project while at the
same time the civil service retrenchment policy imposes restrictions on the hiring of new staff .
These management and implementation problems are being addressed by adopting a project
design that considers: (i) contracting out day-to-day project administration to a PA during the
initial phase of the project; (ii) hiring public and private employees to undertake registration



- 6 -
activities; and (iii) supplementing the central and provincial government personnel of the
implementing agency with personnel obtained on secondment from other areas of the civil
service. The tenns of reference of the PA and of AusAID-funded TA would include provisions
for building local institutional capacity with the aim of gradually handing over project
management to the implementing agency. A mid-term review of the project would focus among
other things, on project progress in overcoming problems related to management and
implementation, and redesigning the project, if necessary.
Poverty Category
19.   The project does not have a poverty category. However, while poverty is not a specific
focus of the project, low income landholders would benefit particularly from the project; without
the project, only the higher income landholders tend to have their real estate titled and registered.
Environmental Aspects
20.   The impact of the project on the environment would be neutral in the short and medium
term. Experience in the Bank-supported Land Titling Projects in Thailand and the Northeast
Region Land Tenure Improvement Project in Brazil do not indicate any significant impact on the
environment. In the long term though, land registration could have positive impacts on the
environment in a number of respects. It would provide incentives to invest for long term land
use (e.g., soil conservation in rural areas, and investments in environmental infrastructure such as
improved drainage, kitchens and bathrooms in urban areas) and provide information, such as
maps, which could be useful in environmental management. In addition, the project would
support studies on community land use rights and recommend procedures for demarcation of
forest boundaries in project areas, in close coordination with the demarcation of protected forest
and conservation areas being undertaken under the IDA-funded Forest Management and
Conservation Project (Cr. 2856-LA).
Program Objective Categories
21.   Project support for secure land rights of investors and other landholders promotes the
achievement of the Bank's program of private sector development and sustainable natural
resource development.
Participatory Approach
22.   Participation of beneficiaries during project design was achieved at two levels. First,
DOLHM was actively involved in the project preparation study, including gathering data,
consultations with other agencies, collection of cost information and the development and
refinement of project design. Government officials were provided with training and taken on
overseas study tours as part of project preparation. Second, a series of workshops were
conducted to discuss the project concept and design; attendance was drawn from national,
provincial and district agencies involved in land management and administration including the
Lao Women's Union which is a non-government organization. During implementation, the new
systematic adjudication aspects of the project would involve full participation of the beneficiaries



-7-
and beneficiary communities in the adjudication process including full membership of the village
head in the adjudication team of each village. In addition, the project would include support for
communication activities to explain the objectives, activities and expected benefits of the project.
Project Benefits
23.   The project is aimed at registering about 258,500 parcels (80 percent of the targeted
parcels) corresponding to an equal number of families (a total of about 1.3 million people out of
a population of 4.5 million) in urban and peri-urban areas who would benefit directly from the
project. The project benefits are derived mainly from land titles. While they do not lend
themselves to conventional economic rate of return analysis, some of these benefits have been
quantified through socio-economic impact studies done for land titling projects especially in
Thailand. Based on the experience gained from these land titling projects, direct benefits to
beneficiaries would include improved tenure security against unfair land acquisition; the
possibility of landholders to sell their land use rights at fair prices; the ability to use land as
collateral; and a reduction in conflicts over land rights and boundaries. Development of efficient
land markets would lead to broader economic benefits including: more efficient and transparent
land transactions which would reduce risk in land-related investments; easier access to the
desired type of land for commercial investment; mobilization of investable financial resources
through the use of land as collateral; and provision of incentives for longer term investment in
land-based activities and land improvement. These project benefits would be monitored and
evaluated during project implementation, with a focus on key project performance indicators (see
para. 26).
24.   Development of land valuation capacity would improve: (i) the land tax administration by
enabling a more objective and realistic assessment of land values, and by making land taxes
responsive to changes in land values particularly in urban areas; (ii) the compensation
mechanisms for land acquired by the state; (iii) the administration of state enterprises and assets
leased to the private sector; and (iv) decision making by lending institutions in regard to values
of land offered as collateral. It is expected that the project would result in increased net
government revenue starting from the third year of the project. Based on conservative
assumptions, the current taxation regime for land consisting of charges for a certificate and
cadastral fees of US$7.6 per parcel, a land tax of US$4.2 per parcel and transfer fees of about
US$1 10 per parcel, would generate incremental revenue of about US$2.0 million by the fifth
year of the project. After deducting project expenditures and debt servicing of the IDA credit,
cumulative net revenues (cash flow) to the Government would amount to US$1.9 million after
five years, and increase to over US$8.0 million by year 10 and to US$19.9 million by year 20;
this would provide a positive net cash flow to the Government every year except the first two
years. While project benefits to the private beneficiaries cannot be quantified at this stage, they
would be expected to exceed by a multiple amount the revenue benefits expected to be enjoyed
by the Government.
25.   Social and Gender Considerations. A majority of women live in areas with strong
matrifocal and matrilocal traditions which embody female land inheritance; however, the
country's constitution and the laws, including the Property Law of 1990, promote equality.



- 8 -
Under these laws, men and women are equally entitled to hold property. Anecdotal evidence
suggests that over 50 percent of inner city land in Vientiane Prefecture is held by females.
Concern has been expressed that the adjudication process could be carried out in a way that does
not fully recognize women's rights. This view is based on experience with the land tax
declaration form where the data was sometimes collected in such a way as to infringe on the
rights of women. The following preventive and corrective measures have been incorporated in
project design so as to preserve women's rights: (i) the Lao Women's Union has been included
as a member of the Project Oversight Committee at provincial level; (ii) provision has been made
for gender awareness training, firstly for staff of the PSU and subsequently for all staff in the
adjudication teams as part of their systematic adjudication training; (iii) efforts would be made
to ensure that, as far as possible, there is female representation in each adjudication team; and
(iv) provision has been made to monitor gender statistics of land registration, together with other
key performance indicators, during project implementation (see para. 26).
26.   The project will also have a social impact. It is expected to result in a reduction of
disputes over land rights in the project areas; such an impact was observed in the Thailarnd Land
Titling Program and is documented in a socioeconomic evaluation study. In addition, the project
will protect the land rights of landholders that do not have documentary evidence of their rights
including those with only customary recognition of their land rights. This applies in particular to
most rural and peri-urban families who, in most cases, own their household land through
customary acknowledgment, rather than formal registration, and it applies to a lesser extent to
urban dwellers who typically own the houses in which they live, and where the incidence of land
registration is higher. An objective of the project is to legalize and register land rights of long
term occupants, and it is proposed to reduce the emphasis on documentary evidence requirements
to enable the occupants to obtain titles. Furthermore, it is known that communal tenure exists
within the project areas. However, this relates to sites regarded as communal lands for common
use by villagers, and such lands would not be targeted for registration. Because of its urban
focus, the project will not face other issues relating to communal land tenure that are commonly
found in the outlying rural areas. A special study under the project will address these issues,
including gender considerations, in order to prepare for the second stage of the land titling
program which will go deeper into the rural areas.
27.   Key Performance Indicators. Project progress would be tracked against targets which
would be refined annually and would be of two broad types: straightforward project output
indicators; and efficiency and financial indicators though introduced at a later stage. Output
indicators include: base maps produced; parcels identified, surveyed and titles issued; offices
built; staff trained; and scholarships and studies completed. Efficiency indicators include those
related to the improvement of land office operations: registration costs relative to staff numbers;
and transactions completed against staff numbers. A third type of indicators would measure the
impact of the project by assessment and data collection during the socio-economic impact studies
on at least a semi-annual basis. These include costs per title; government real estate taxes
generated; credit obtained using land titles as collateral; and changes in the use of agricultural
inputs.

held down land registration rates (see para. 16); these would be tested as part of the project's
pre-implementation activities before being streamlined into the main project. The project would
start small, with a gradual build-up, and is flexibly designed to incorporate lessons from
implementation experiences. Initially the project would operate in areas of strong economic
activity, and hence with the largest potential for generating demand for land titling and economic
benefits. While the project risks cannot be entirely eliminated, the potential benefits from the
project make it worth taking the risks.
Recommendation
29.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the
Association and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
