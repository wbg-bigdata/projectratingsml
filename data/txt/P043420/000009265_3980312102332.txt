Block 1: Project Description
1. Project dlevelopment objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
Strengthen regulation, increase private sector participation in investment and management, and improve the overall
efficiency of ]Brazil's water supply and sewerage (W&S) sector and, within the north, northeast and center-west (N, NE &
CW) regions, increase the coverage levels of W&S services of participating utilities and improve the quality of water bodies
located in staltes and municipalities served by participating utilities.
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):

3. Benefits and target population:
Project benefits include an expansion of water supply and sewage collection and treatment services; an elimination of
intermittent provision and rationing (planned interruptions) of water service; a quality improvement of water supplied; and a
reduction of water pollution levels. The improved hygienic and environmental conditions that result from increasing the
coverage, quality and reliability of water and sewerage services translate into better quality of life. Better hygienic
conditions lead to decreased infant mortality and reduced incidence of water-borne diseases. Improved environmental
conditions contribute to the recovery of beaches, enhance tourism activities and other water uses, and increase recreational
activities. From an institutional point of view, project benefits focus on increasing economic efficiency in sector service
operations. Project benefits expected from encouraging private sector participation and a decentralized provision of water
and sewerage services, in a competitive and appropriately regulated environment, are: improved operational and financial
performance of participating utilities; reduced financial transfers from the public sector to water utilities; and a temporary
but significant generation ofjobs for unskilled workers.
Subprojects in six states and 24 municipalities are already under review. The municipalities with subprojects under
preparation are: Joao Pessoa, Campina Grande and Santa Rita (Paraiba); Fortaleza and Aracati (Ceara); Caruaru, Pesqueira
and Varzea do Una (Pernambuco); Pedro II, Altos, Piripiri and Floriano (Piaui); Cuiaba, Varzea Grande, Juara, Juina,
Pontal, Pontes e Lacerda, Primavera, Sinop, Sorriso (Mato Grosso); and Juazeiro and Itabuna (Bahia). Projects for the last
two municipalities have been presented by their municipal companies, remaining projects have been presented by State Water
Companies (SWCs). At project completion, the subprojects in these municipalities would benefit about:
* 1.17 million with new water in-house connections;
* 1.84 million with fewer hours of rationing or intermittent water service;
* 0.33 million with water supply of improved quality; and
* 0.59 million with new in-house sewerage and 0.98 million with sewage treatment services.
After the end of the implementation period and until the full impact of these subprojects is obtained, about 1.30 million more
would benefit from water production and transmission projects, 0.92 million more would benefit from sewage collection, and
0.71 million more would have their sewage treated (see Annex 2 for an evaluation of these subprojects and a detailed
description of the selected project eligibility criteria).
Targeted popmr1ation: Project investment targets the poor. Estimates based on actual surveys in five localities
representative of the targeted population (Fortaleza, Joao Pessoa, Caruaru, Itabuna and Santa Rita), show that about 65%
of the expected beneficiaries of water investments are in the poverty group (households earning less than 3 Minimum

Salaries [MS] per month), 3 1% are middle-income households (households making between 3 and 8 MS per month), and
only 4% are high income households (households making more that 8 MS per month). Meanwhile, estimates based on
actual surveys of the expected beneficiaries of sanitation investments in the localities of Aracati, Cuiaba, Juazeiro and Joao
Pessoa, show that about 59% of them are in the poverty group, 31% are middle-income households, and only 10% are high
income households.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: Five years, including 6 months start up and wrap up periods.
Executing agencies: Private and public water companies within the north, northeast and center-west regions.
Project coordination: Project management, promotion and coordination will be done by the Project Management Unit
(PMU) of the ongoing Water Sector Modernization Project (WSMP). The PMU, established within SEPURB and IPEA, is
led by a Coordinator financed under the project. Following the consolidation of the modernization projects into a single
modernization program, the PMU was expanded, reorganized, and placed in charge of the entire program. The Coordinator
is now assisted by three full-time managers financed under the project, one in charge of WSMP coordination, another in
charge of WSM II preparation and coordination, and the third manager in charge of the program's administrative and
financial tasks. To avoid creating a large PMU, a team of qualified consultants (individuals and consulting firms, as
needed), assists the PMU managing the sector institutional and regulatory reform, monitoring the performance of utilities
and supervising the execution of investment subprojects. The PMU's responsibilities are detailed in Annex 2, Section A.
Project oversight and policy guidance: The Secretary of Urban Policy (SEPURB) of the Ministry of Planning and Budget,
assisted by qualified consultants, would provide the policy framework for sector development and overall guidance to the
project.
Onlending arrangements: Bank funds will finance the management, reform and operational components, and all water
supply investments. OECF funds will finance sewage collection and final disposal investments. Bank funds will be
transferred from the Federal Government to local governments and publicly controlled utilities on the same terms and
conditions as the Bank loan, including the foreign exchange risk; and to privately controlled utilities on market ternns and
conditions. One half of OECF funds will be transferred from the Federal Government to local governments and utilities on
the same terms and conditions as the OECF loan, including the foreign exchange risk. The other half of OECF funds will
be transferred from the Federal Government to local governments and utilities as grants. On top of the Bank's terms and
conditions, the financial agents (Banco do Brasil and Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econ6mico e Social - BNDES)
may charge an administrative fee smaller than 0.5% to participating utilities.
Flow of documents: Eligible local governments (any state or municipality for purposes of sector reform) or water
companies (any water company within the N, NE & CW regions) may submit subprojects to the consideration of the PMU.
Local governments eligibility will be evaluated by the PMU and sector reform projects will be initially evaluated by either
the PMU (regulation, primarily) or BNDES (privatization involving concessions) following agreed eligibility criteria (see
Annex 2, Sections B). Financing of Operational Development (OD) and Investment subprojects will require a prior
eligibility of the corresponding utility to that type of financing (see Annex 2, Section C). To judge a company eligibility, the
PMU will conduct a detailed financial evaluation of the utility's financial health, with emphasis on how the proposed project
affects its financial position and how the prospect of repaying the loan looks. Following a positive financial assessment, the
PMU will check the project's per capita investment costs against agreed limits (US$120 per water projects and US$250 per
sewerage projects, including treatment). A positive answer would launch a detailed technical, environmental, economical,
and financial assessment of the project (to be prepared and appraised in accordance with the agreed methodology presented
in the Operational Manual-OM). Eligible subprojects will then be submitted to the Bank for its approval and approved
subprojects executed by the companies under the PMU coordination (BNDES in case of private concessionaires) (see OM).
Bidding documents will be prepared based on agreed procurement rules (see Annex 6).

Flow offunis: Bank and OECF funds will be competitively allocated. The loans will be made to the Federal Government
which, through the Banco do Brasil and BNDES, will make subloans to the water companies. These subloans, which could
be used by the federal govemment to promote fiscal reform in local governments, will be made only to those utilities or local
governments with one or more subprojects already approved for financing. Any utility or local government may receive any
number of subloans during the lijFe of the project. However, to eliminate the risk of concentrating the loan in two or three
large companies, the total amount of Bank and OECF funds available to each company will be limited by its size, as
follows: US$90 million to large-size companies and states (the SWCs and state governments of Bahia and Pernambuco);
US$60 million to medium-size companies (the remaining SWCs and state governments within the north, northeast and
center-west, and the municipal or regional companies with more than 100,000 water connections); and US$30 million to
small-size companies (other municipal companies). Prior to signature authorization, STN will verify the sub-borrower's
"adimpl8ncia" with federal agencies, appraise its indebtedness capacity, and ask for guarantees from the local government
(federal transfers from the "fondo de participacao" and tax revenues) and the companies (own operating revenues). To
provide the required guarantees, local governments should have legislative authorization and the utilities authorization from
their Board of Directors.
Accounting, financial management and auditing arrangements: The project will utilize the accounting and financial
systems of the ongoing WSMP. STN will audit the project's Special Account and the project account and SOE of the
Federal Comjponent. External auditors acceptable to the Bank will audit the project accounts, SOE, financial statements,
and operatioral performance of each of the subborrowers. The subborrowers will use the project account format developed
under the WSMP for financial reporting.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: Monitoring and evaluation will be done by the Bank and qualified consultants.
Participating utilities will prepare and submit to the PMU quarterly reports on the progress of project implementation. The
Borrower, through the PMU, will prepare and submit to the Bank semiannual Progress Reports, in January and July of each
year. The July Progress Report will include an Annual Operating Plan which will describe, inter alia, the project activities
to be carried out during the next calendar year, including an adequate justification for the inclusion of each one; a complete
appraisal of each new subproject; and a detailed description of how the relevant local government or utility meet the
corresponding eligibility criteria, including any environmental and resettlement requirements. The Bank will carry out at
least two full supervision missions and one partial supervision per year. The Bank supervision mission to take place in the
third quarter of the year 2000 will be the project's Mid-tern Review.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objectives supported by the project:          Document number and date of latest CAS discussion:
Report No. 16582-BR; June 12, 1997
Structural rejbrm of Brazil 's water supply and sewerage sector.
Separation of regulatory and operational roles and ownership diversification, the main objectives of the reform, are
expected to reduce the size of fiscal transfers and public sector employment by increasing operational and financial
efficiency of sector operations and capital in-flight to the sector. The 1995 Concession Law opened a window of
opportunity for accelerating reformns in the infrastructure sector. Making use of this opportunity, the project supports the
CAS reform objective by lending to build institutional capacity to conduct the privatization and regulation processes, and
physical investments to address urgent rehabilitation and emergency needs. Physical investrnents selected to favor privately
operated companies and public companies willing to meet the high efficiency levels exhibited by privately operated ones.
Diminish poverty and inequity by improving health conditions and quality of life ofpoorer urban population and regions
(E, NE & C, where service levels fall much behind the South and Southeast,).
Access to water supply and sanitation translates into reduced levels of infant mortality and water-borne diseases, as well as
more years of life expectancy. Poor urban people benefit more than proportionally from improvements in the urban
environment and from reduced levels of water pollution, because they are the social group more affected by these problems.

6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Main sector issues are:
* Heavily concentrated lack of services in the N, NE & CW regions and arnong the poorest population all over the country.
In 1991, while 86% of all urban households had in-house water connections, only 67% of households in the north, 78% in
the northeast, and 80% in the center-west had in-house water connections. In the same year, 37% of all urban households
making two minimum salaries or less did not have in-house water connections and 56% did not have in-house sewerage
connections or even a septic tank.
* Increasingly poor provision of services, in particular in the poorer regions and to the poorest population. More than one-
half of the population connected to a water system receives less than fully satisfactory services and suffers from
intermnittent provision and rationing of water service.
* Seriously deteriorated environment in the larger metropolitan centers and heavily industrialized areas partially caused by
water pollution. Water pollution that, in turn, is caused by inadequate levels of investment, lack of appropriate cost
recovery, ineffective technology, insufficient coordination between different government levels, inadequate capacity to
enforce environmental regulations and standards, and limited involvement of users and NGOs.
* Recurrent financial problems worsening during the last years, in particular in the N and NE regions where many utilities
have become financially insolvent. Sector financial policies, in particular tariff and subsidy policies and their cost
controls, need to be urgently revisited. A lack of appropriate labor and commercial policies, as well as proper
maintenance and rehabilitation of existing facilities, worsen the utilities' financial situation. A de facto grant policy via
periodic goverunent assumptions of the utilities' long-term debt adds more confusion and lack of clarity to the sector
financial policy.
* The investment decision process is not governed by financial and economic principles but by a politically dominated
system that usually discriminates against rehabilitation and other less expensive solutions.
* Politicization of management and lack of accountability demand a new and more competitive institutional model. Despite
the substantial progress achieved by PLANASA, the model is now superseded and, to improve the sector's poor
perfornance, a major institutional reform is required, including private sector participation.
* Allocation of regulatory functions and responsibilities between states and municipal governments is unclear regarding
systems of common interest. This lack of clarity is a permanent cause of political uncertainty and immobility. The lack
of clarity is also responsible for long delays in the reform process, in most cases through the erection of legal barriers to
the reform itself.
The Government strategy, which follows the National Water Supply and Sanitation Policy, seeks to expand the provision
of W&S services to Brazil's entire population and improve service delivery efficiency by encouraging a more competitive
and better regulated environment. The following guidelines summarize the objectives and goals of the govemment's reform
and modemization strategy:
* separation of competencies between the concession-granting authority and the service providers;
* promotion of different decentralized altematives for services provision;
* promotion of wide social participation in the regulation and control of services;
* implementation of low-cost technologies in efficiently operated systems;
* provision of technically, financially and economically feasible services, with tariff schemes and subsidies for low-income
families adequate to assure universal access to basic services; and
* participation, cooperation and integration of the Federal and local Govemments and the society for the solution of the
sector's problems.

7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
* The strategic choice of limiting the scope of project investments to the N, NE & CW regions will focus the federal
investmnent effort in the poorer and less developed areas of the country.
* The politicization of management and its lack of unaccountability are issues that will be addressed by supporting and
promoting private sector participation and helping to define and establish appropriate regulation. The introduction of a
classification system linked to the utilities' operational and financial performance, the rigorous enforcement of the system

(linking the utility's ranking to its eligibility to previously agreed resource pools), and the periodic publication of basic
sector statistics by the federal government (a kind of yardstick competition) are actions planned to expedite institutional
reform through competition in the market.
* The project will also address the need for a new financial model, consistent with urban poverty alleviation. It is expected
that successful reform in some states and municipalities will make sector reform more attractive and with wider popular
support. Since inefficient pricing and ill-functioning utilities limit the benefits of poverty targeted programs, it is also
expected that sector reform will enhance the effectiveness of poverty targeted programs.
* The definition of subproject selection criteria providing incentives to the development and implementation of
unaccounted-for water control programs and other small but high return operational, financial and administrative actions,
and urgent rehabilitation and emergency investments in drinking water distribution systems and largely delayed
investments in sewage collection and treatment, attempts to replace the politically dominated investment decision process,
currently in place, for a system governed by financial and economic principles.

8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
Privatization (only) Project. Limit the Bank financial assistance to only those utilities and local governments with clear
commitment to private sector participation (PSP). This alternative was rejected. First, the Federal government does not
agree with a "privatization only" strategy. It sees PSP as a very important tool, but not the only available tool to help
achieve efficiency and service expansion. Unlike in other developing countries, in Brazil public utilities deliver relatively
good water and sewerage services and, at least a number of them, are relatively well managed. Second, the project's focus
on the poorer northern states makes the "privatization only" alternative difficult to implement.
A line of crea'it alternative was rejected because it does not provide appropriated economic incentives for resource
allocation, including the distribution and control of financial funds. In addition, adherence to project rules is very difficult
to obtain through this type of project because of its requirement of large and, normally, unrealistic project preparation and
supervision capacity.
A conventional supply-driven investnent project was rejected because it is an alternative not conducive to an efficient use
of resources, in both cost and size, Investment plans supporting this alternative are normally inefficient and the incentives
towards efficiency are too weak and vague. The underlying selection criteria is usually governed by political considerations
which favors ]large and visible projects.
Technical Assistance. This alternative was rejected. Service coverage in N, NE & CW regions falls much behind southern
regions. Besides intellectual leadership and consultants, financial support to expand basic sanitation infrastructure is
essential in these regions.
The proposed project encourages PSP (by setting a lower eligibility hurdle for utilities committed to PSP), but does not
discourage public utilities from trying to become more efficient. The proposed project allows public utilities to try to
achieve higher efficiency targets within an agreed timefrane. When a utility fails to achieve the targets, further
disbursement will be suspended, until the utility and the responsible state/municipal government initiate a profound
institutional reform, including PSP and establishment of independent regulatory agencies.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The performance of even the best prepared project will turn out to be unsatisfactory if there is lack of local counterpart
funding (LCF). To minimnize LCF, a problem that has affected most water projects (including WSMP), the project will:
* reduce LCF to 15% of the project cost (about the estimated sum of project-generated taxes, which the Bank does not
finance);
* secure LCF financing by requesting from each utility to open an audited account, exclusively for LCF; and
* limit to two the number of agencies financing each project.
Participation should be demand-driven. Companies selection by the Federal Government, as in WSMP, will be replaced
by self-selection based on compliance with agreed eligibility criteria (see Annex 2).
Competitive allocation of resources should be promoted To avoid a rigid allocation of financial resources to a few
utilities, competition within targeted regions (N, NE & CW) will be promoted by allocating resources based on actual
disbursement (first request received, first disbursement made).
Strict adherence to loan covenants and project rules is necessary for project success. The classification of utilities into
different leve]s will facilitate a rigorous application of covenants and rules because of the opportunity to upgrade and
downgrade utilities according to their performance.

Borrower commitment to and ownership of the project assures an efficient, smooth andfast implementation. Local
governments' explicit commitment to sector reform will be a condition to project participation (see Annex 2). The earlier
dialogue with local governments will continue throughout the entire period of project implementation.
Avoid over-dimensioning of the loan and make realistic implementation schedule. WSM II is much smaller than previous
loans (US$150 mnillion for 19 states), and its implementation plan incorporates sufficient time for start-up and closing.
The poor performance ofpublic utilities normally results from weak implementation capacity. To avoid a slow start of
project implementation, usually the first manifestation of weak implementation capacity, potential participants were asked
to get involved in detailed preparatory work early during project preparation. As a result of this work, the project is front-
loaded with aL significant pipeline of subprojects, including the 33 subprojects already appraised (see Annex 2).
Procurement risks should be minimized. Procurement planning has been a priority during project preparation. Projects
with bidding documents ready are worth about US$60 million, including all projects planned to start in the first year of
project implementation.
As few as possible conditions of effectiveness improves quality at entry. No condition will be left to be met or completed
before effectiveness. Participants will comply with this requirement thanks to the care taken in planning and implementing
preparatory vvork. The large number of potential participants makes this approach feasible.
Few, simple and practi cal performance indicators make supervision more objective and efficient. The experience
obtained from WSMP and the Espirito Santo Water project, together with the guidelines and facilities introduced by the
new appraisall documents, guarantees the achievement of this key lesson.

11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
Borrower cornmitment to sector reform is indicated by:
* its current efforts to separate sector operators from regulators, as exemplified by the financing of every request it has
received from local governments to study, define and implement independent water regulatory agencies in their political
jurisdictions (i.e., the States of Rio de Janeiro, Mato Grosso, Para, Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul, and the
Municipality of Recife); and
* its interest in innovative approaches to the institutional reform of the sector, including privatization, as exemplified by its
financial support to the sub-national governments seeking to define appropriate institutional models (e.g., to state
governments participating in Reform-Privatization Projects.
Borrower ownership is indicated by:
* the government's repeated requests for a follow-up to the WSMP, which the government sees as its best tool to improve
sector efficiency and expand service provision;
* the importance attached by the Federal Government to replacing PLANAS.A (the old institutional model), with a
competitive and decentralized model reflecting today's new political reality; and
* by the pressure on the MPO from states and municipalities not participating in WSMP, and by the utilities' willingness to
participate in a follow-up project.
Borrower commitment and ownership is explained by:
* the prominence taken by the ongoing WSMP as the key federal program in the water sector, which has become the
federal "address" of the water sector in the country, mostly in recognition to the strong technical leadership the federal
government has developed throughout its implementation;
* the healthy and growing debate on the sector's main issues that has been generated by the policies and papers written for
or in reference to the WSMP. The WSMP has financed the definition of key federal policies (including the National
Policy for Water and Sanitation), the preparation and discussion of a number of papers on subjects ranging from the
sector's institutional reform to its financial model to specific demand studies (see Section 9), and planted the seed from

12. Value added of Bank support:
* Better chances of achieving strong PSP because of credibility and transparency of Bank work.
* Worldwide experience in the definition and implementation of projects similar in both technical design and institutional
reform objectives.
• Less political interference and better control of financial resources during project execution.
* Multidisciplinary support to the federal and local governments and the utilities to formulate, design, appraise and
implement project policies and projects.

The WSM 11 project's economic feasibility was determined using a sample of subprojects that account for 55 percent of
project's cost. This sample represents all types of project interventions to be financed under WSM II, including the
expansion of water supply coverage, reduction in rationing and intermittent water supplies, improvement in (drinking) water
quality, and expansion of sewage collection and treatment systems. At the earliest stage of the project, the selected
subprojects were chosen as the best alternative among different options using least-cost techniques.
The results show that all subprojects, with the exception of the water supply project in Caruaru, are economically viable, as
they will generate positive net benefits. The difference between financial and economic costs (taxes, subsidies and other
market distortions) have been summarized in conversion factors. The economic benefits are estimated to be equal to the
willingness to pay for access to and/or improvements of the water supply and sewerage services. A so-called "short-cut"
economic analysis, in which the financial analysis was adjusted for the impact of taxes and subsidies (but not for other
market distortions), was conducted to determine the fiscal impact of the water supply and sewerage projects and the viability
of the different componenets of the water supply projects. All operational development programs tumed out to be
economically profitable. However, the rehabilitation and expansion water supply projects in Caruaru, Itabuna and Joao
Pessoa are not "short-cut" economically viable, when appraised as projects independent from the operational development
programs. But when appraised considering that they are phased in time and take place after the implementation of the
operational development programs, only the project in Caruaru appears unfeasible. Although the expansion and
rehabilitation project in Itabuna is "short-cut" economically viable, the risks associated with this project are very high (it is
a highly unstable project with only 54% chances of generating a positive benefit) and it should not be implemented.
The fiscal impact of the project is positive and estimated at R$ 12 million (R$ 22 million extrapolating to the total cost of
the project). The fiscal transfers to the government more than offset the large capital subsidies given to the sewerage
projects. The distributive analysis of the project shows that the consumers stand to gain the most from the project. They
receive about 64 percent of the externalities generated by the project, which are estimated at R$ 101 million (R$ 183 million
extrapolating to the total cost of the project). Society realizes also a significant share of the benefits because of the positive
externalities involved in the treatment of sewerage. The government will also make an important gain and the labor force
will benefit from the significant wage premiums that the water companies pay over the market price for equivalent labor.
The sensitivity analysis shows that the subprojects are robust. Changes in the major risk variables (unaccounted-for water,

analysis was conducted to test the impact of simultaneous changes in the major risk variables. The risk analysis showed
that all projects, with the exception of the water rehabilitation and expansion projects in Caruaru and Itabuna, are risk free.

Financial assessment was carried out on two levels: (i) at subproject level, to assess the financial viability of each
subproject; and (ii) at utility level, to assess the financial viability of each utility. Sensitivity and risk analyses on critical
assumptions were conducted for both levels.
Subproject levelfinancial assessment. The analysis shows that all water supply projects -- with the exception of Caruaru --
are financially viable. When the water supply projects are treated as two separate projects, the OD subprojects are highly
profitable. The results for the investments in the rehabilitation and expansion of the water supply systems are less clear.
The water supply project in Fortaleza is financially viable due to economies of scale and the presence of a relatively
efficiently run water company. Hence, the policy to make companies only eligible for investrnent financing once they have
achieved a certain level of efficiency seems to be justified, and the other projects should not be executed simultaneously with
the OD programs. The projects in Joao Pessoa and Santa Rita are viable when implemented after completing the OD
program. The project in Itabuna is a bordercase. It is not financially viable when implemented after completion of the OD
program, but it is economically viable; as such it is a marginal project. The investment project in Caruaru should be
rejected. Sewerage projects are all financially viable thanks to the large capital subsidy given to them and, because of the
large positive externalities that they generate, they also present high economic rates of retum.
When testing the impact of changes in the major risk variables (collection efficiency, unaccounted-for water, labor
productivity, investment cost overruns and project delays), the project turns out to be rather robust. The financial risk
analysis confirmed the project's viability. With the exception of the water rehabilitation and expansion projects in Itabuna
and Caruaru, all water supply subprojects have relatively high probabilities of generating positive net benefits. The
sewerage projects turn out to be virtually free of financial risk.
Utility level financial assessment. As analysis was carried out of the financial structure, efficiency and viability of the
participating utilities. After experiencing several years of losses, most utilities are now profitable, thanks to lower inflation
and recent taiiff adjustments. Financial efficiency of the utilities, however, leaves much scope for improvement. Most
utilities are characterized by high operating costs, low bill collection rates, relatively low employee productivity (a recent
improvement due to voluntary retirement plans and more aggressive downsizing programs). Tariff levels were adjusted in
the recent years to a level sufficient to cover operating and investment costs. Summary financial assessment of three of the
utilities analyzed are presented in Annex 5 and the rest, including sensitivity analyses, are available in project files.
Financial Eligibility Criteria. The project will reward the utilities which achieve higher efficiency. Minimum financial
viability is required for any utility to have access to resources allocated for the operational development component.
Increasingly higher financial efficiency is required to access resources allocated to investment components. If utilities do
not achieve thie efficiency targets within an agreed timeframe, further disbursements will be suspended. Alternatively, the
companies can choose a "reform route". Under the "reform route", where a far-reaching transformation of the companies is
called for, all financial and operational eligibility criteria are waived. The underlying assumption is that once transformed
with private sector participation, the companies would naturally become financially and operationally efficient. Under the
"efficiency route" the companies must demonstrate through selected indicators that they have the sufficient financial and

The three investment components to which the assessment is relevant are: (i) institutional development, predominantly
geared to control unaccounted-for water and improve commercial efficiency; (ii) water supply, investments geared towards
improved operation of existing and future networks; and (iii), sewage collection and treatment, rehabilitation or expansion
and new systems (see a detailed description in Annex 2, Section A). The technical assessment was conducted in a sound
and competent method, taking into consideration all historical and socio-economic tendencies that are indigenous to Brazil.
With this in mind, not necessarily the state of the art or the most expensive solution was sought when examining the diverse
alternatives for each subproject. Low-cost technologies, such as the use of the condominial system, were often found to be
the optimal solution. In addition, when applicable, the studies conformed to accepted agronomic, health, educational or
other standards. See Annex 2, Section C for a detailed description of subprojects eligibility criteria. The appraisal
confirmed that cost estimates and engineering data were based on accurate information and that physical and price
contingencies were adequately considered. The 12 sewerage subprojects (worth about US$102 million) and 12 out of the 14
water supply subprojects (worth about US$134 million) reviewed at appraisal were found technically acceptable. The
average cost of eligible water supply subprojects is US$11.1 million and of sewerage subprojects is US$8.5 million.
Eligible water supply subprojects cost between US$2.2 million and US$43.5 million, and have per capita costs between
US$22 and US$116. Sewerage subprojects cost between US$2.6 million and US$19.0 million, and have per capita costs
between US$29 to US$248. See Annex 2, Section C for a summary of costs and beneficiaries (Tables 4 and 6) and main
physical targets (Tables 5 and 7) of the subprojects reviewed at appraisal.
16. Institutio     Assessment: ;;---...............................
Executing agencies: Executing agencies are municipal and state water utilities. Executing capacity of these utilities vary.
Utilities with previous experience with the World Bank and other multilateral financial institutions tend to have more
capacity than others without such experience. In general, however, these public utilities have limited planning and
administrative capacity. To assure satisfactory project implementation since its beginning, substantial assistance has been
and will continue to be provided to potential participants by the Bank and the PMU during project preparation, appraisal
and implementation: companies were asked to submit subprojects very early during the project's preparatory stage;
subproject identification was reviewed by the PMU; preliminary designs were extensively revised with the help of qualified
consultants hired by the PMU to assist the companies; 33 subprojects were appraised by the Bank and the PMU.
Procurement will be facilitated by a detailed set of guidelines, instructions, standard forms and examples that will be made
available to the companies by the PMU. Utilities' staff in charge of handling procurement are being trained by the PMU.
Biding documents have already been produced for works worth about US$45 million, including most projects planned to
start in the first year of project implementation. Few, simple and practical performance indicators have been agreed with
potential participants to make supervision more objective and efficient. Furthermore, an exchange of ideas with WSMP
companies is being and will continue to be encouraged to take advantage of the lessons learned and best practices.
Project management: Overall project management will continue to be carried out by the PMU of the ongoing WSMP. The
PMU comprises a multi-disciplinary team experienced in the Bank project procedures and is routinely assisted by
experienced consultants (individuals and firms). The type of training and technical assistance that is currently offered to
sector companies to support project execution in critical areas, such as procurement, accounting and audit, project
supervision and monitoring of benchmarks, will be continued and strengthened in the institutional area.

17. Social Assessment:
Detailed information about service conditions and beneficiary attitudes toward methods for improving service quality and
coverage, willingness and capacity to pay, and interest in participating in the design, construction and maintenance of civil
works was obtained from the willingness to pay (WTP) studies, the sectoral and project specific Environmental
Assessments, and a number of meetings held with a variety of project stakeholders (state and municipal governments,
multilateral and bilateral donors, potential beneficiaries, NGOs and community-based organizations). Projects in which the
community involvement and participation is the key to their successful implementation and sustainability, such as the

sewerage systems built with the community selecting the type of collectors to use for each set of houses ("condominial"
system), were special targets for rigorous analyses of this type. In areas targeted for the construction of sewerage systems
to replace old makeshift solutions, sanitary education programs and financing of household connections up to the bathroom
were identified as necessary to increase the acceptance of the new systems.
Additional consultation and socio-economic studies were carried out for subprojects entailing resettlement. In Caruaru
(Pemambuco) and Joao Pessoa (Paraiba), the number and current conditions of affected households were identified, and
resettlement plans prepared (see specific Environmental Assessments and related documents in Project Files). Programs to
strengthen environmental management were discussed with beneficiary companies and the state agencies in charge of
environmental regulation.
Targetedpopulation: Project investment targets the poor. Estimates based on actual surveys in five localities representative
of the targeted population (Fortaleza, Joao Pessoa, Caruaru, Itabuna and Santa Rita), show that about 65% of the expected
beneficiaries of water investments are in the poverty group (households earning less than 3 Minimum Salaries [MS] per
month), 31% are middle-income households (households making between 3 and 8 MS per month), and only 4% are high
income households (households making more than 8 MS per month). Meanwhile, estimates based on actual surveys of the
expected beneficiaries of sanitation investments in the localities of Aracati, Cuiaba, Juazeiro and Joao Pessoa, show that
about 59% of them are in the poverty group, 31% are middle-income households, and only 10% are high income
households. ]Estimates are consistent with the fact that, in general, water coverage is much larger than sewerage coverage
all over Brazil - an issue addressed by the project.
Affordability. Brazilian companies apply a minimum consumption level (MCL) to their residential customers, charging
increasing block tariffs to the remaining consumption. The MCL is intended to provide households with enough water to
satisfy basic needs and maintain minimum health and sanitary conditions (usually 10 m3/month), and charged a minimum
monthly charge (MMC). The residential MMC for water service varies from about 2% of one MS in the Ceara's SWC to
about 4% in Mato Grosso's SWC. The combined MMC for both water and sewerage services varies from about 4% of one
MS in Juazeiro's water company to 7.2% of one MS in Paraiba's SWC. These MMC are well within the range of
acceptability Iby Bank standards. (A standard often accepted by Bank projects has been to keep water and sanitation
charges under 5% of three MS or 15% of one MS.) In addition, most companies also have a special or "social" category for
their poorest customers, which is easily affordable even for the poorest segment of the population. In Paraiba's SWC, for
example, the social tariff is sligthly higher than one half the ordinary residential (which is equivalent to about 4.1% of one
MS). Although the companies' social classification does not approximate very well the income distribution at the
households level, they are in general, however, a good proxy for income distribution at the aggregate level (i.e., at the level
of a neighborhtood or a municipality).
The communities' initial interest in access to public water supply and sewerage systems was double-checked surveying
about 50 households in each of the following towns: Sinop and Juina in Mato Grosso (to explore the demand for water
supply); and Crateus, Quixada, Maracanau, Maranguape, Aracati and Cascavel, six small-size localities in Ceara (to
explore the demand for sewerage services).
Tariffs affordability was also studied estimating the WTP for water and sewerage services. The WTP was estimated based
on surveys prepared for Fortaleza (Ceara), Joao Pessoa and Santa Rita (Paraiba), and Itabuna and Juazeiro (Bahia), where
2,176 households were interviewed, and a Contingent Valuation study. The study shows that WTP is about four to six
times larger fcr access to water supply services than for improvements in water quality or reductions in water rationing. On
the other hand, WTP for sewage collection (about the same than the WTP for access to water supply) is about three times
larger than for sewage treatment. 'Ihe study consistently suggests that the poor are willing to pay about 1% of their income
for improvements in water quality, reductions in water rationing or sewage treatment; and about 3% of their income for
sewage collection. The WTP for access to water supply, however, oscillates abruptly between 3.5% and 11% of their
income. Values are within the range of acceptability by Bank standards.

18. Environmental Assessment:         Environmental Category  [w/ A         [ ] B          [ I C
The project will finance a wide variety of water and sanitation infrastructure projects in participating states and
municipalities. If free standing, a few of those subprojects would be category A for environmental purposes. Therefore, it
was agreed with the federal government that the project as a whole would have the same category. All subprojects will have
important positive impacts on the environmental quality of rivers and aquatic ecosystems. Improved provision of potable
water is expected to have positive impacts on health conditions. Rather than relying on a project-specific approach to
Enviromnental Assessment (EA), thereby limiting the impact of the project on environmental issues associated with the
sector, a sectoral EA for the water and sanitation sector was carried out in accordance with terms of reference agreed with
the Bank. Key sectoral issues related to the environment were identified including: (i) weak environmental mnanagement
capacity in state and municipal water and sanitation companies; (ii) weak enforcement capacity in state environmental
agencies; (iii) the need for environmental guidelines for the design, construction and operation of water and sanitation
projects; and (iv) the need for improving and streamlining environmental licensing procedures for water and sanitation
projects, and improving the quality of environmental assessment reports. These sector-wide issues will be addressed
through an environmental strengthening program to be financed by the project through: (i) the provision of technical
assistance, training and some equipment to participating water and sanitation companies and state environmental agencies;
(ii) the preparation of streamlined environmental screening and licensing procedures, to be agreed with the environmental
agencies; and (iii) the preparation of environmental specifications for the design, construction and operation of water and
sanitation projects. Environmental criteria, procedures, and requirements will be included in the Operational Manual.
All 33 sub-projects proposed during preparation were subjected to a detailed screening for potential negative environmental
impacts due to project siting, water use, or wastewater discharges. Full EAs were carried out for the most sensitive projects
following TOR agreed with the Bank. A report with environmental summaries of these projects was prepared and is
included as part of the sectoral EA. The sectoral EA was completed and discussed at a workshop with the participation of
sector companies and environmental secretariats. The final EA report, including complementary studies on the subprojects
in Carauaru and Joao Pessoa, is available in Brasilia, at each participating state capital and in project files. An executive
summary in English was prepared by the government and circulated to the Board on April 14, 1997.
Two projects (a wastewater treatment plant in Joao Pessoa and a water supply reservoir in Caruaru) require the resettlement
of local populations. Specific resettlement plans for these two projects were prepared following Bank's policies on
resettlement. A resettlement framework (including policies, procedures, and TOR), approved by the government for any
future project requiring resettlement, is included as a part of the sectoral EA and the OM.

Different strategies for public, institutional and community consultation and participation were developed and implemented
during project preparation. They will also be applied during project implementation. Sectoral issues related to the
environment were discussed in two workshops with the participation of water and sanitation companies, state environmental
agencies, and professional associations. A broad community consultation program regarding communal-type sanitation
services, initiated during project preparation, will continue during implementation. Project-specific consultation with
communities affected by the siting of two projects has been carried out with the participation of local organizations and
municipal agencies (Joao Pessoa and Caruaru).

20. Sustainability:
The main challenge is to achieve and sustain good performance of the utilities (as measured by the operational and financial
indicators on efficiency defined in Annexes I and 2). In the past the Bank has tried to improve the performance of public
utilities through "institutional strengthening programs". Many achieved results but sustaining the performance was often
difficult. The main reasons were: (i) highly politicized company management; (ii) lack of competition for the market; and
(iii) lack of economic incentives - lack of regulatory framework and contractual commitment to concession owners, i.e., the
municipalities.
The environment is now more favorable. Water public utilities are now subject to competition for the market, including
from the private sector, thanks to the Concession Law of 1995 and proposed projects of Law specific to the W&S sector.
Furthermore, the proposed project would ensure performance sustainability by: (i) providing incentives to undertake
irreversible institutional reform including PSP or any other measures aimed to de-politicize company management; and (ii)
establishing regulatory frameworks for the sector which separate regulation from service provision and provide economic
incentives to become more efficient, through reforms in areas such as tariff setting, environmental and service standards,
and rules and penalties.
The sustainability of each W&S system is achieved through rigorous application of project analysis and cost recovery rules.

24. Other
An agreement between the federal government and BNDES to re-lend to BNDES all funds necessary to finance subprojects
to be carried out by private utilities should have been signed not later than five months after the signing of the Loan
Agreement.
Subject to the eventual suspension of the Bank loan, the OECF loan should become effective by December 31, 1998.
However, the loan would not be suspended if adequate funds from other sources are made available for the project by the
Borrower.
Company and project eligibility, as well as project implementation, will be governed by the criteria agreed between the
federal government and the Bank, as they are stated in the OM and the Resettlement Framework.
Based on the provisions and specific procedures set forth in the OM and not later than 18 months after the signing of the
Loan Agreement, the Borrower will employ consultants to certify the financial and operational performance of the
participating utilities and the progress achieved in implementing legal, institutional and regulatory reforms.
The PMU will prepare and furnish to the Bank semiannual Progress Reports and Annual Operating Plans.

Annex 2
Water Sector Modernization II
Detailed Project Description
The project is a US$300 mnillion sector operation that will fund technical assistance and investment
subprojects designed as a catalyst of the structural reform of Brazil's water supply and sewerage (W&S)
sector. Technical assistance will focus at building institutional capacity to conduct and consolidate the
incipient process towards sector regulation and private sector participation (PSP). Subproject financing
will focus at improving overall provision of water supply and sewerage services in Brazil's poorer regions
(north, northeast and center-west), supporting urgent rehabilitation and emergency investments in drinking
water distribution systems and largely delayed investments in sewage collection and treatment.
The project consists of four components: (i) management & promotion, (ii) water sector institutional and
regulatory reform, (iii) operational development, and (iv) investment. US$40.8 million (13.9% of project
cost) corresponding to physical and price contingencies will be available to project participants as
unallocated funds. Project implementation is expected to take five years, including start up and wrap up
periods of six months. The closing date will be June 30, 2003 and the completion date December 31, 2002.
Section A below provides a detailed description of the project components, including objectives, estimated
baseline cost, percentages of Bank financing, repayment responsibility and eligible expenditure categories.
Section B describes selected project eligibility criteria and explains how they are expected to gradually
improve the utility performance by linking the specific project components to either specific actions
towards private sector participation or certain financial indicators and actions. Section C summarizes the
methodology followed during project preparation and the main physical characteristics of the subprojects
reviewed during appraisal.
A. Project Components
1. Management & Promotion
This component will finance the management costs of the project at the federal level, whose baseline cost is
estimated at US$7.0 rnillion. The Management and Promotion component will finance up to 100% (net of
taxes) of the goods and consultant services needed for the day-to-day management of project
implementation (execution of component two and supervision of components three and four) and the
promotion and dissemination of project experiences. This component will be 100% repaid by the federal
government.
Project management, promotion and coordination will be done by the Project Management Unit (PMU) of
the ongoing Water Sector Modernization Project (WSMP). The PMU, established within SEPURB and
IPEA, is lead by a Coordinator financed under the project. Following the consolidation of the
modernization projects into a single modernization program, the PMU was expanded, reorganized, and
placed in charge of the entire program. The Coordinator is now assisted by three full-time managers
financed under the project, one in charge of WSMP coordination, another in charge of WSM II preparation
and coordination, and the third manager in charge of the program's administrative and financial tasks. To
avoid creating a large PMU, a team of qualified consultants (individuals and consulting firms, as needed),
assists the PMU managing the sector institutional and regulatory reform, monitoring the performance of
utilities and supervising the execution of investment subprojects. The Secretary of Urban Policy



22
(SEPURB) of the Ministry of Planning and Budget, assisted by qualified consultants, provides the policy
framework for sector development and overall guidance to project implementation.
Main responsibilities of the PMU include, inter alia:
*  coordination of the financial agents;
*  monitor overall project iLmplementation, including maintenance of all project files;
*  management of all consultant contracts related to the water sector institutional and regulatory reform
component;
*  review and approval of bidding documents and short-lists and, in accordance with Bank review
thresholds, submission to the Bank for no objection;
*  review and approval of operational development and investment subprojects and submission to the
- Bank for no objection;
* provide technical assistance to eligible utilities in preparing new subprojects;
* maintenance and update of project implementation schedule, expenditure forecast and control systems;
* review compliance of utilities and subprojects to agreed eligibility criteria and legal covenants;
* collection, review and comment of external auditors' reports on utilities and subprojects financial and
physical performance;
* preparation and submission to the Bank of semi-annual progress reports;
* design and coordination of training activities;
* assistance to state and municipal governments to prepare regulatory frameworks and prepare and
operationalize PSP transactions;
* assistance to sector utilities during the transition from public to private management;
* assistance to public and private concessionaires to design and implement low-cost and community-
oriented subprojects;
3 act as focal point collecting data and disseminating information;
* further development and update of the sector's information system, including initiatives to use it to
mobbilize project financing and establish a yardstick competition system; and
* coordination of the preparation of the project's Implementation Completion Report.
2. Water Sector Institutional and Regulatory Reform
This component will finance technical assistance related to establishing sector regulatory frameworks and
undertaking institutional transformation of Brazil's W&S sector, including financial assistance to contract
out private management services. Funding from the Water Sector Institutional and Regulatory Reform,
whose baseline cost is estimated at US$22.0 million, will be available to local governments' and utilities'
comiitted to reform. The signature of an Agreement of Technical Cooperation between the Federal and the
local governments, based on the local government conformity with the National Policy of Water and
Sanitation, has been defined as a reasonable demonstration of commitment to reform.
The Water Sector Institutional and Regulatory Reform component will finance up to 100% (net of taxes) of
the studies, goods and consultant services needed to support:
a. programs of the federal, state or municipal governments aiming at the institutional and regulatory
refoim of the water sector, including, inter alia:
* technical assistance to states and municipalities for the formulation of the respective water policy;
ihe elaboration of the legal and regulatory framework related to the provision of W&S services;
and the establishment of a regulatory entity for the sector, including training for its staff;
* the further development of sector programs and data banks;



23
*  the development and implementation of a utility rating data base and a yardstick regulation system;
*  environmental management programs;
*  demand studies;
*  sector planning at the local level; and
*  preliminary studies on private sector participation and regulation.
b. Institutional reform programs of water utilities in the project area (Brazil's N, NE & CW regions)
including, inter alia:
*  technical assistance on institutional reform;
*  technical and legal studies for PSP, including contract preparation and negotiations assistance;
*  seed funds to contract out management services;
*  tariff and cost studies;
* environmental management programs; and
* technical assistance for the preparation of investment projects
Repayment of subcomponent (a) will be responsibility of the federal government and repayment of
subcomponent (b) of the beneficiary utilities.
3. Operational Development
This component will finance the development and implementation of unaccounted-for water (UfW) control
subprojects and other small but profitable operational, financial and administrative actions, in water
utilities within the project area with minimal levels of operational and financial efficiency (see Subproject
Eligibility Criteria in Section C, below). The Operational Development component, whose baseline cost is
estimated at US$63.5 million, will be available to finance up to 85% of the consultant services, goods and
works needed to support, inter alia:
*  supply and instailation of water macro- and micro-meters;
*  pitometry;
*  upgrading of substandard connections;
*  supply of emergency and maintenance equipment;
*  energy conservation programs;
*  survey and rectification of physical losses;
*  review and update of technical and commercial cadastres;
*  update, review or development of commercial, financial, accounting and information systems;
*  decentralization of operational and managerial functions;
*  marketing and communication programs; and
*  training.
Funding from this component is expected to reduce costs, increase revenue and improve cashflows of the
utilities, to enable them to access the Investment Component described below. Activities under the
Operational Development Component will be 100% repaid by the beneficiary utilities.

4. Investment
This component will be available to finance the expansion, upgrading and revamping of water supply and
sewerage systems of utilities, within the project area, which show given levels of operational and financial
efficiency (see Subproject Eligibility Criteria in Section C, below). The Investment Component, whose
baseline cost is estimated at US$165.7 million, will finance up to 85% of civil works, goods and
consultant services needed to support, inter alia:
* expansion of water supply and sewage collection and treatrnent systems;
* building of new sewage collection and treatrnent systems;
* improving and extending services to the poor;
* rehalbilitating and replacing aging and ill maintained pipes and collectors;
*  revamping water and sewage treatment plants and water intake facilities; and
* repairing and replacing pumping and control equipment.
Funding from the Investment Component is expected to achieve higher operational and financial efficiency,
the separation of operational and regulatory roles and, in most cases, the imnplementation of a proper tariff
structure for the poor. Water supply investments will be financed by the Bank and fully repaid by the
utilities. Sewerage investments will be financed by OECF and repaid 50% by the utilities and 50% by the
federal government (a partial grant designed as an incentive to promote appropriate sewage treatment in
Brazil's poorer regions).
B. Company Eligibility Criteria
1. Company Eligibility Criteria and Project Components
To be eligible for each of the project components described above, participating water companies must
comply with certain criteria. The companies can choose either the "reform route" or the "operational and
financial efficiency route". Under the "reform route", where a far-reaching transformation of the
companies is called for, all financial and operational eligibility criteria are waived. The underlying
assumption is that once transformed with private sector participation, the companies would naturally
become financially and operationally efficient. Under the "efficiency route" the companies must
demonstrate through selected indicators that they have the sufficient financial and operational capacity to
implement the investments.
2. Selection of Financial Indicators for Eligibility Criteria
As described in Table 1 below, the companies which select the "efficiency route" must demonstrate their
financial capacity through a set of financial indicators (Table 2), to become eligible for the different project
components. The financial indicators were selected based on the current financial and operational
performlance of the utilities as described in Annex 5. The companies must improve the financial indicators
to have access to the "higher levels" of investment components. Each project component is designed to
help the water companies achieve a higher level of eligibility status. For example, the Operational
Development Component (Level 1) would focus on high return investments, such as metering, cadastering,
etc., that would help improve the financial performance. The better financial performance would allow the
comparny to attain higher levels of eligibility status (Levels 2 and 3'). The current eligibility status of the
selected project companies is presented in Annex 5.

3. Selectioin of Benchmark Indicators
The target levels of these indicators were determined based on a rough benchmarking exercise. We used
the indicators of selected Latin American water utilities -- Aguas Argentinas (the private concessionaire
operating Buenos Aires), EMOS (Santiago de Chile), Empresas Publicas de Medellin (Medellin,
Colombia), and southeast of Brazil -- to define the benchmarks. We then set the project eligibility criteria
so the project participants will gradually work towards the targets.

C. Subprojects Eligibility Criteria
1. Selection Criteria
Once the N, NE & CW regions were defined as the project area and subproject eligibility criteria was
agreed, the water utilities within the N, NE & CW were invited to present their five-year investment plans
and identify priority subprojects for consideration under WSM I1 financing. Subprojects estimated to cost
about US$350 million (17% more than the US$300 million agreed as project cost) were presented. The
criteria agreed for the selection of subprojects within the utilities' five-year investment plans was:
*  subprojects in systems operated by state water companies (SWCs) or in systems operated by municipal
water companies serving markets above 75,000 people;
*  service expansion subprojects to reach low-income areas;
* water subprojects with expected high rates of return, preferably because of the inclusion of network
optimization, sectorization and rehabilitation components; and
*  subprojects with a large positive impact on the sanitary and environmental conditions of localities and
receiving water bodies.
In addition to these eligibility criteria, the project preparation unit prepared terms of reference to orient
utilities in the preparation of the subprojects and, at the same time, provide a consistent framework for the
subsequent analysis and evaluation. Given the institutional weakness of most utilities in the targeted
regions, the project preparation unit also made available the services of a number of consultants to assist
the utilities in preparing the subprojects within pre-established deadlines. Many of these consultants were
chosen for the same geographical areas of the utilities and thus had previous knowledge of the utilities'
activities. The technical orientation given to the utilities included the following guidelines:
*  subprojects should be a component of the utility's investment program and, in the case of major
subprojects, should be related to an existing master plan;
*  existing water production capacity should be sufficient to accommodate projected service expansion;
*  water supply subprojects should include an UfW control program when current level exceed 30%;
*  water supply subprojects should include micro and macrometering programs;
*  subprojects should be based on justifiable detailed projections of population and water demand;
*  per capita cost of water supply projects should not exceed US$135;
*  per capita cost of sewage collection and treatment subprojects should not exceed US$250;
* subprojects should present a study of comparison of alternatives, both conceptual and technological,
for the various subcomponents of the project;
*  economic and financial evaluations of each subproject should be prepared; and
*  sewerage subprojects should ensure the proper disposal of the collected sewage and ensure the quality
of the receiving water bodies while taking into consideration the present and potential uses.
2. Highlights of Design Methodology
Projections of Population and Water Demand. Detailed thirty years population and demand projections
are prepared for each subproject, using census data of 1970, 1980 and 1991. Population projections for
the base year (1996) are compared with and adjusted taking into consideration data from other sources,
such as cadastral surveys and electricity connections. In parallel, a careful analysis of per capita water
demand (consumption plus losses) is carried out. The per capita consumption is calculated from historical
data from metered connections, except in areas of low level metering. A per capita consumption adjusted
by including industrial and commercial water use is also calculated. Moreover, a stratification of the
population by income levels is carried out into three groups (less than 3 minimum salaries (MS), between



28
four and eighth MS and more than 8 MS) in order to determine the impact of the subproject on the various
income groups and the consumption by income levels. The per capita consumption level of subprojects
evaluated during preparation varies from 107 l/d to 152 l/d when only residential use is taken into
consideration; and from 118 I/d to 192 Vd when non-residential use is also taken into consideration.
Least-Cost Alternative. The technical design for each subproject is based on the determination of the
alternative which provides the least cost over the life of the subproject, taking into consideration all
construction and operational costs. Similarly, with the objective of rnaximizing its rate of return, each
subproject is studied in function of possible phase construction and optimization of the existing capacity.
Specifically, the comparison of alternatives is based on the following guidelines:
*  water supply subprojects should be always accompanied with operational improvement components
such as reduction of UfW;
*  when possible, subproject implementation should be scheduled in stages to optimize the use of
investments;
*  the optimum investment plan for expansion should be determined postponing investment in water
production as much as allowed by the demand projection, making full utilization of existing capacity,
and minimizing resulting idle capacity; and
*  altenmatives should be selected after taking into account all social and environmental externalities.
Specific Guiding Criteria for Operational Development. It is recommended that, based on the
company's medium-term strategic vision, a group of actions designed to improve its operational efficiency
be packaged as a single operational development program. Main issues addressed by this type of programs
are descibed in Section A.3 of this Annex.
Specific Guiding Criteria for Water Supply. The economic diameter of a water main is based on a
comparison that takes into consideration the size of pipes (for different acceptable flow velocities), cost of
energy (for each size of pipe), type of pipe material and maintenance cost, all brought to present values.
For treatment plants, phased construction is recommended.
Specific Guiding Criteria for Sewage Collection and Treatment. For the treatment plant, the type and
level of treatment are based on the conditions of the receiving body. Moreover, the topography and the
availability of the required land determine the level of decentralization that is feasible. The pumping
stations and force mains are designed based on the optimization of the economic diamneter including the
long-termr cost of operation. For the collection network, both the conventional and condominial systems,
when applicable, are considered. In the case of condominial systems, costs are compared for the
installation of pipes in backyards, in front yards and under sidewalks.
3. Main Physical Characteristics.
Water SSupply. Fourteen (14) subprojects were developed during project preparation in Fortaleza (CE);
Caruaru (PE); Joao Pessoa, Campina Grande, Santa Rita (PB); Cuiaba, Varzea Grande, Sorriso, Pontes e
Lacerda, Sinop, Juara, Juina(MA); and Juazeiro and Itabuna (BA). In these localities, the water supply
service can be described as follows:
* in all of them, the existing system does not satisfy the water demand, requiring a strengthening of the
primary network and expansion of the secondary network and house connections, in addition to a
reorganization and redefinition of the distribution and pressure zones;
* in all of them, UfW levels are very high varying between 42% and 67%;



29
* in at least eighth of these localities (Fortaleza, Caruaru, Joao Pessoa, Campina Grande, Cuiaba,
Varzea Grande, Itabuna and Juazeiro), especially in their peripheral areas, water supply service is
intermnittent;
* in at least seven of them (Fortaleza, Santa Rita, Pontes e Lacerda, Juina, Juara, Sinop and Sorriso),
large segments of the population without service are using sources of water of dubious quality at
relatively high prices; and
* in most of them, water demand exceeds production.
Following this diagnosis, the adopted solutions in all subprojects emphasize improving the distribution
network, trying to regularize the distribution network and increase the number of connections using the
existing capacity. The guidelines for the development of the subprojects follow three basic criteria:
*  the reduction of UfW as a means of increasing the availability of water without having the augment the
production;
* the sectorization of the distribution network with the definition of distribution sectors and pressure
zones, through the rehabilitation and construction of water mains and reservoirs, eliminating the need to
pump directly through the distribution network; and
* the optimization of the installed capacity of the entire water supply system with the phased modulation
of the various components.
Table 4 shows the objective, cost (total and per capita), population size, expected coverage after project
completion, and number of beneficiaries of each of the fourteen water supply subprojects reviewed at
appraisal (details are available in project files). Table 5 summarizes their main physical targets. At
various times during project preparation, Bank missions reviewed and commented on the development of
these subprojects, all of which were prepared based on the agreed guidelines. Except for the subprojects at
Juina and Caruaru, both with per capita costs above the preset limit of US$120, all subprojects were found
technically viable. Both subprojects will be redesigned. Besides, the subproject at Caruaru is not
environmentally viable, and additional mitigatory measures to remedy detected environmental problems are
being defined and will be incorporated into the final design.
Sewage Collection and Treatment. Twelve (12) subprojects were developed during project preparation in
Aracati, Quixada, Crateus, Maranguape, Maracanau (CE); Joao Pessoa, Campina Grande, Santa Rita,
Souza (PB), Cuiba (MA); Juazeiro, Itabuna (BA). In these localities, sewage collection and treatment
services can be described as having:
* very low levels of coverage, some using septic tanks and the rest discharging directly into water ways
and drainage canals, seriously threatening public health and the environment;
*  no public sewer system (as in Aracati, Maracanau and Maranguape); or low collection and treatment
coverage (as in Crateus, Quixada, Souza and Itabuna); or low collection coverage and not treatment
(as in Santa Rita);
* a relatively high collection coverage but treatment available for a only a part of the population (as in
Joao Pessoa and Campina Grande);
*  low coverage but high treatment capacity (as in Cuiaba and Juazeiro);
All subprojects reviewed at appraisal emphasized increasing the coverage of sewage collection and the
treatment capacity for all collected sewage, and the majority of them adopted the condominial system for
sewage collection and stabilization ponds for sewage treatment. The condominial system was selected
because of its low total cost, despite its requirement of heavy community involvement and health education.



30
After contemplating alternatives ranging from stabilization ponds to communal septic tanks with anaerobic
filters to upflow anaerobic sludge blanket filters, the stabilization pond in its various combinations was the
most commonly adopted option for sewage treatment, partially due to the familiarity of the utilities with
this technology. Other guidelines followed for the development of sewerage subprojects suggested to fully
utilize any existing treatment capacity before attempting a system expansion; and whenever possible, to
adopt a decentralized treatment approach, in order to minimize the size of the plants and the cost of
investment and operation.

L_____________ partially eliminate rationing
I/ Total cost includes investment and operational development programs focused in the given locality, as well as 20% physical contingencies.
2V The per capita cost is measured as the ratio between the present value of the flow of project costs (initial investment plus additional costs due to
nonnal population growth, building of fulture phases and reposition) and the present value of the flow of annual incremental project beneficiaries
up to fHU impacL
3/ The beneficiaries from reducion in water rationing in Caruaru and Santa Rita include the beneficiaries from improvement in water quality (a
population of
about 220,400 in Caruaru and 109,700 in Santa Rita).

Table 6 shows the objective, cost (total and per capita), population size, expected coverage after project
completion, and number of beneficiaries of each of the twelve sewage collection and treatment subprojects
reviewed at appraisal (details are available in project files). At various times during project preparation,
Bank mnissions reviewed and commented on the development of these 12 subprojects, whose main physical
targets are summarized in Table 7. During appraisal, all were analyzed and found to be technically viable
with the exception of the treatment subprojects of Joao Pessoa and Campina Grande which will be
resubmitted after redesigning for the least cost alternatives. All subprojects present costs which fall below
the per capita limit set at the initiation of the preparation. All subprojects have also been evaluated from a
social and environmental perspective and some mitigation actions are included in the cost structure. All
subprojects will include environmental monitoring of the discharge and the receiving water body and health
education of the beneficiaries. In the case of Joao Pessoa, the subproject will also include funds for the
protection of ecologically-sensitive areas, resettlement of affected people, and a study on the impact of a
nearby solid waste landfill.

Water Sector Modernization II
Cost-Benefit Analysis
The Second Water Sector Modernization (WSM II) project, which comprises a large number of subprojects
competing to be financed under the project, is financially and economically viable. This conclusion is
drawn from detailed financial, economic and distributive analyses, enhanced by elaborate sensitivity and
risk analyses, practiced on a sample of five water supply and four sewage disposal subprojects. Selected
subprojects include systems affected by the major problems faced by water utilities in Brazil's north,
northeast and center-west regions.
L. Objectives
The objectives of the WSM II project are: first, to strengthen regulation, increase private sector
participation in investment and management, and improve the overall efficiency of Brazil's water supply
and sewerage (W&S) sector and, second, within the north, northeast and center-west (N, NE & CW)
regions, to increase the coverage levels of W&S services of participating utilities and improve the quality of
water bodies located in states and municipalities served by participating utilities. On the basis of these
objectives, the cost-benefit analysis was used to determine: (i) the financial and economic viability of the
investment subprojects that will be partially financed by the Bank; (ii) the distributive impact of those
subprojects; and (iii) the risk profile of each subproject.
II. Methodology
Tlhe cost benefit analysis began with the selection of a representative sample of subprojects to be appraised
from three perspectives: financial, economic and distributive analysis. Before embarking on the process of
data collection and the preparation of cash flow tables, each subproject was jointly revisited by economic
analysts and engineers. The purpose was to get acquainted with the subproject's technical characteristics,
and the justification for its selection, including alternatives considered, the use of least-cost analysis and the
timing of the investments. The definition of the "with" and "without" project scenarios; the identification
of separable components; and the preparation, execution and analysis of willingness to pay (WTP) surveys
were steps in the process of data collection. The final step consisted of the preparation of the financial,
economic, distributive, sensitive and risk analyses.
Sample Selection
A multidisciplinary team identified the environmental, social, financial and economic factors that could
affect the group of subprojects initially proposed for Bank and OECF financing. Following the analysis,
33 subprojects in 23 municipalities (14 water supply subprojects and 19 sewerage subprojects) were
selected as possible candidates for financing. Size, per capita and total costs estimates, as well as the
environmental, economic, and financial impacts of each technical alternative were further refined based on
additional and more detailed studies (see Project Files).
The major operational problems, identified based on a quick diagnosis of the five state and two municipal
companies that submitted the selected initial group of 33 subprojects, are:



36
In the wiater supply systems:
*  lackc of access to public water supply in some neighborhoods;
*  a large number of rationing hours in some service areas;
*  water quality levels below recommended standards.
*  large unaccounted-for water levels, often accompanied by rationing and poor service quality (low
pressure, for example); and
In the sewerage systems:
* generalized lack of access to sewage collection and treatment; and
*  sewage treatment plants with low operational efficiency and significant idle capacity.
In view of the time and costs involved when preparing full-fledged economic analyses, a sample of nine
subprojects was selected (see Table 1). This sample accounts for 55 percent of the total costs of the project
(US$ 300 million) and represents all major problems affecting water supply and sewerage (W&S) systems
in the N, NE & CW regions.

Alternatives
Each subproject included in the sample is the best alternative among several options formulated at the
earliest stage of project preparation (see Annex 2, Section C). Different technologies, planning horizons,
quality sitandards, and timing of investments were considered to select the subprojects. The technical and
environmiental feasibility of 'the selected alternatives were checked and subprojects adjusted if required.
Subprojects with expected net present benefits larger than zero are considered eligible for financing. But
instead of selecting from a pool of subprojects until financing funds are reduced to zero, subprojects will be
approvedl and financed based on a first come, first served basis. Competition will replace the usual
selection process based on a comparison of net present values (NPVs). Comparison would only be used if
the cost of a group of subprojects simultaneously requesting financing exceeds available funds.



37
Components
Every subproject was initially prepared and presented as either a water supply or a sewage disposal
initiative. The water supply subprojects, in particular, were presented as comprising two different but
interdependent components: operational development (OD) and rehabilitation and expansion investments.
It is however clear that they are indeed separable components. An OD component, designed to finance the
development and implementation of unaccounted-for water (UFW) control prograrns and other small but
highly profitable actions (see Annex 2, Section A), may always be built independently from the investment
component. Each component was then financially and economically appraised as a self-standing water
supply project and both of them as elements of a single water supply project.
Scenarios
To identify the incremental costs and benefits resulting from each subproject, "with" and "without" project
scenarios were built for each one of them. The "with" project scenario considers the proposed investment
plan and its associated targets. The "without" project scenario considers that the service would continue
unchanged, that is, the current performance, coverage, UFW levels and other operational and financial
indicators will remain the same during the projects' expected life. Investments needed to keep these
indicators unchanged are of course considered in the flow of costs in the "without" project scenario.
Incremental Costs and Benefits
Costs and benefits associated with the "with" and "without" project scenarios are projected for 30 years,
that is, during the implementation period and until the full impact of the subprojects is obtained. The cash
flows were discounted using a discount rate of 12 percent which is estimated to be a proxy of Brazil's
opportunity cost of capital'. Benefits from the water supply subprojects include the reduction or elimination
of rationing and intermittent water supplies, water quality improvements, and service coverage increases.
Benefits from sewerage (sewage collection and treatment) subprojects include a reduction of water pollution
levels and service coverage increases. The improved hygienic and environmental conditions that result from
increasing water supply and sewerage coverage, and the quality and reliability of these services translate into
better quality of life. Improved hygienic conditions lead to decreases in infant mortality and a reduction in
the incidence of water-borne diseases. Improved environmental conditions contribute to the recovery of
beaches, enhance tourism activities and other water uses, and increase recreational activities. However, no
effort is made to quantify specific health benefits. It is assumed that all benefits resulting from a better
environment are captured in the willingness to pay for sewage disposal services. Additional benefits, that
were not included in the analysis, comprise a reduction of financial transfers from the local governments to
the water utilities and a temporary but significant generation of jobs during project implementation.
Evaluation
The project is evaluated from three different perspectives. The financial viability of each subproject is
appraised measuring its flows of costs and benefits in market prices, which focus the evaluation on the
subgroup of the population directly affected by the project. Under a financial perspective, benefits are
assumed equal to the estimated flow of financial revenues. That is, financial benefits are defined as equal
to expected tariffs times estimated consumption. The economic viability is appraised measuring the flows

Coastal Pollution Management Project in Brazil, April 8, 1997. A case study on analysis of water projects, under

of costs and benefits in shadow prices, which aggregates all benefits and costs to the entire economy
(particularly important in this project because of its intangible environmental effects, which are often not
efficiently allocated by the imarket). Under an economic perspective, benefits are assumed equal to the
WTP for water supply and sewage disposal services (estimated through surveys designed to measure the
use and non-use value of these services) for each project beneficiary. The flow of financial costs is
transforned into a economic costs through the use of conversion factors. The definition of a third stream
of costs and benefits allows a "short-cut" economic analysis. Under this method, the calculation of
economic costs is reduced to subtracting taxes from and adding subsidies to the financial costs, while
economic benefits are assumed equal to the financial benefits. The distributive analysis identifies winners
and losers among the different groups in society with interests and stakes in the project: the federal and
local governments, the water companies and their customers, labor, and the inhabitants of the region in
general. Finally, the sensitivity and risk analysis enhances the accuracy of financial and economic
analyses by incorporating uncertainties of the real world into the analyses.
III. Assumptions
The primary source of data are the water companies which have supplied the Project Management Unit
(PMU) with market demand and supply, project specifics, comprehensive cost and investment data, project
financing, details, expected financial returns, and market distortions. The PMU, with the collaboration of
the companies and based on terms of reference agreed with the Bank, evaluated the project from different
perspectilves: technical, environmental, economic, financial, social and participatory analysis. The PMU
also provided us with the results of an extensive WTP survey, and additional data on the current
performance of Brazil's water supply and sewerage sector, including data on present trends and costs.
Investment costs include project preparation, transportation of equipment and materials, environmental
compensatory actions, physical contingencies, and supervision. "With" and "without" project scenarios
include connections cost generated from population growth, but only the "with" project scenario includes
the connections cost generated from larger coverage. The "with" project scenario also includes the
investment cost of the project's future stages, and the replacement cost of meters and electromechanical
equipmenit.
Operational and maintenance (O&M) costs include the cost of labor, chemicals, power, third party
services and general costs. O&M costs for the "without" project scenario are based on current unit costs.
O&M costs for the "with" project scenario are estimated analyzing the opportunities to increase cost-
efficiency in the operations of the companies. This analysis is carried out by examining the expected
impacts of a company's proposed operational development program, and the company's current operational
performance and trends vis-a-vis national and regional indicators and trends. Labor cost are calculated as
the number of employees per 1,000 water and sewerage connections (labor productivity) times the number
of connections times the average cost per employee. In the "without" project scenario, labor productivity
remains constant and the number of connections increases so as to keep the coverage level constant. In the
"with" project scenario, labor productivity and the number of connections increase in accordance with the
project's targets. Social contributions, including labor related taxes, are assumed at 70 percent of nominal
salaries. One half of the social contributions are assumed to return to the workers through the retirement
pension plans, factory lunches, and other social programs. Chemical costs are calculated as projected
water production volumes times the chemicals' unit prices times the amount of chemicals required per m3.
Chemical use is kept unchanged, except in Caruaru where it is expected to increase. Electricity costs are
calculated as projected water production volumes times the estimated installed demand and electricity
consumption (as calculated for each subproject) times projected electricity tariffs. Costs of third party
services and general costs are calculated as percentages of labor costs and total O&M costs, respectively.



39
The opportunity costs of raw water are assumed equal to zero.
The implementation schedule of each subproject varies from 2 to 5 years depending on its complexity and
the company's technical and administrative capacity.
Current andprojectedpopulation in the project areas are based on the 1991 IBGE census, the most recent
cadasters of the water and power utilities operating in the project area, and the number of households per
connection served by the water company. Coverage levels were estimated by the companies based on their
own planning and resources availability. The annual targets for the installation of new service connections
result from the projected coverage levels.
Per capita water consumption was calculated as the weighted average of the current per capita
consumption of metered and non-metered households. The actual per capita consumption of metered
households was estimated by income level (less than 3 minimum salaries (MS), more than 3 and less than 8
MS, and more than 8 MS), based on statistical representative samples selected among metered households
and monthly records during a calendar year. Using the 1991 IBGE census, the actual consumption of
metered households by income level was extrapolated to estimate the average per capita consumption of the
whole locality (see Revisao dos Estudos de "per capita" in Project Files). Per capita water consumption
of non-metered households was assumed equal to that of metered customers, after adjustments for price and
income elasticity. Non-residential water consumption is calculated as a percentage of residential
consumption, based on historical records. The discharge factor to collectors and interceptors was assumed
as 0.85 and the infiltration factor between 1.17 and 1.10.
Water billed. Water billed differentiates between metered and non-metered consumption. Non-metered
water billed was assumed equal to the water volume given by the number of non-metered households times
the water volume allocated to each one in the tariff structure as "minimum consumption" (usually 10
m3/household/month, except in CAGECE, Ceara, where it is 16 m3/household/month)2.
The metering index was projected based on a gradual increase up to 100 percent (95 percent in Caruaru,
and 72 percent in Fortaleza) in 3 years (4 years in Joao Pessoa and Santa Rita).
Unaccounted-for water, defined as water billed over water supplied, was estimated to gradually decrease
during 10 years until reaching 30 percent. The physical losses are assumed to be 40 percent of total UFW.
The division between commercial (60 percent) and physical (40 percent) losses was based on companies'
estimates and the results of recent studies in CESAN, SABESP and CASAN. Water production was
calculated as water consumption adjusted by physical losses and estimated illegal consumption (part of the
commercial losses).
The tariffstructures and levels were assumed to remain unchanged for both the "with" and "without"
project scenarios. A 10 percent tariff increase that is recommended to CAGECE, Ceara, was not included.
Price and income elasticities were estimated as -0.30 and 0.19, respectively. The annual average household
income was estimated to grow at 2 percent during the next 5 years. The collection efficiency rate, defined
as sales collected over total sales, was assumed to remain unchanged in the "without" project scenario and
gradually increase up to 95 percent in the next 5 years in the "with" project scenario.
2 The analysis as conducted assumes that the benefits of metering are reflected without any delay in the benefits of installation
and hence actual consumption.

Taxes on services (applicable to civil works, projects and supervision), industrial products (applicable to
materials and industrialized equipment) and the circulation of goods and services (applicable to materials
and equipment, including electricity and chemicals)are, on average, 4 percent, 6 percent, and 17 percent,
respectively. Subsidies to electricity consumption and the capital cost of the sewerage projects of,
respectively, 17.6 percent and 50 percent were also considered. No multiplier effects on the local economy
were considered.
IV. Financial Analysis
The financial analysis of each subproject measures the flow of costs and benefits in market prices. The
financial viability of each subproject is appraised from the total investment point of view which, excluding
the cost of financing, allows a more accurate assessment of the financial returns of the project. Cost and
benefits are measured in market prices and calculated based on the assumptions presented in the last
section. The project horizon is set at 30 years and the annual cash flows are discounted at a rate of 12
percent, which is assumed to be Brazil's opportunity cost of capital.
Complete Project
The water supply project in Caruaru is not financially viable (see Table 2), but all other water supply and
sewerage projects are highly profitable. The entire sample of nine subprojects would generate net benefits
of about R$ 141 million.

Operational Development
All water supply subprojects are defined as comprising an operational development (OD) and a
rehabilitaLtion and expansion (investment) subcomponent. The OD subcomponent is conceived as a priority
group of actions addressing key operational problems, whose solution is essential to achieve the proposed
long-run objectives of the complete project. As a result of its conception, OD subcomponents are supposed
to generate large benefits with relative lower costs. The financial analysis shows that this is indeed the
case. All OD subcomponents generate large positive NPV and internal rates of return (IRR) much larger
than those of the corresponding rehabilitation and expansion investment subcomponents and of the
complete subproject (see Table 3).

Rehabilitation and Expansion lnvestments
The rehabilitation and expansion (investment) subcomponent of Fortaleza is financially viable due to
economies of scale and the presence of a relatively efficiently run water company. The investment
subcomponents of Caruaru, Itabuna, Joao Pessoa and Santa Rita generate negative financial NPV (see
Table 3). However, this is the result of evaluating the investment projects as independent alternatives.
When the investment projects in Joao Pessoa and Santa Rita are appraised considering that they are phased
in time and take place after the implementation of the operational development (OD) projects, they are
financially feasible. The NPV of the net benefits are R$ 1.21 million in Joao Pessoa and R$ 3.13 million in
Santa Rita, and the financial rates of return increases are 20% and 32%, respectively.
In other words, the financial viability of investment projects is underestimated when they are appraised as
independent alternatives. But the investment components are actually dependent from the results of the
operational development components. An investment project can only take place simultaneously with or
after the implementation of an OD program. As such, the benefits of the operational development program
should be included in the definition of the "with" and "without" rehabilitation and expansion investment
project scenario.
The investmnent projects in Caruaru and Itabuna, even when evaluated including the benefits expected from
the corresponding OD projects, continue to be financially unfeasible. Itabuna's case is the most interesting.
Water supply is currently rationed during a large number of hours in large areas of Itabuna. The project's
OD component reduces total hours of rationing through the improvement of Itabuna's system and
redistribute the remaining hours of rationing among the entire population. EMASA, Itabuna's water
company, expects to delay the beginning of the expansion work of its water production system until the
year 2000, by reducing the rationing problem to a manageable size. The company expects that properly
supported by appropriate water conservation and other demand management actions, this strategy of
rationing reduction and "democratization" will allow it to gain enough time to, later on, attempt a long-term
and final solution to Itabuna's water supply problems. However, the company also asked financing for a
short-term investment program. The financial analysis shows that such a program is financially
unprofitable (would result in losses of R$83,000) and should not be implemented.

V. Economic Analysis
The economic viability of each subproject is appraised converting financial cash flows into economic cash
flows by using conversion factors and WTP estimates (that include the use and non-use values of water
supply and sewerage services), and then discounting these cash flows using a discount rate of 12 percent3.
Conversion factors
Conversion factors eliminate market distortions created by taxes, tariffs and subsidies, add a premium on
foreign exchange on the tradable components of each input, and account for any changes in domestic prices
that may occur as a result of the project. All economic costs of the project inputs are lower than the market
costs due to the high taxes and tariffs charged in Brazil that offset the impact of subsidies and foreign
exchange premium (see Table 4). Only energy costs have a conversion factor that is close to one, and that
is not because of lack of market distortions but because the different impacts cancel each other out. The
project suffers substantially from market distortions as is reflected in the low conversion factors, with
unskilled labor as the most illustrative example. Labor's low conversion factor is mainly explained by the
high premium received by employees of the Brazilian water sector (in 1995, the annual gross salary of
several water sector companies exceeded US$ 40,000). The land market was assumed undistorted, with a
financial price equal to the economic price (a conversion factor equal to one). Since taxes and tariffs are
merely transfer payments from consumers to the government, they are not treated as a resource cost to
society (they have a conversion factor equal to zero).
Table 4. Conversion Factors
Labor
- unskilled                      0.46
- semi-skilled                   0.81
- skilled                        0.81
Materials                        0.88
Equipment                        0.80
Chemicals                        0.83
Electricity                      0.97
Transport cost                   0.78
Willingness to Pay
A contingency valuation study based on willingness to pay (WTP) surveys was conducted: (i) to capture
the non-use value of sewage disposal services, the intangible value that is not captured by the market and
does not. generate financial returns, including any recreational and environmental benefits that could be
attributed to the project; (ii) to estimate the benefit of other project interventions whose value is not
completely captivated by the market, such as the reduction or elimination of rationing; and (iii) to study the
perceived value of water supply and sewerage services vis-a vis their current prices.
3 The conversion factors were provided by the PMU based on the above quoted case study by Kim and Jayawardena (1997)
and their own research, in particular with reference to the cost of non-qualified labor in the northeast. The economic
premium on foreign exchange is assumed to be 12.06 percent above the current market exchange rate based also on Kim and
Jayawardena.



43
The non-use economic value of clean water is negligible because consumers are aware of most of its
benefits. Nevertheless, the total economic value of water is noticeably greater than the total financial value
because of the value placed on unpaid and illegally acquired water. In other words, the companies' water
revenues underestimate the true value of water to society. Commercial losses represent water that is
actually used free of charge. On the contrary, the non-use economic value of sewage disposal services is
large due to externalities and benefits that are not typically attributed to the service. Externalities to the
entire society, such as the benefits that arise from living in a cleaner environment; and benefits to
consumers, such as the benefit of maintaining the purity of water sources.
The WTP for water supply and sewerage services were estimated based on how the services are expected to
improve as a consequence of the projects. Water supply related surveys were prepared differentiating
between: (i) households that have access to rationed water supply and will enjoyed a non-rationed service;
(ii) households that have access to rationed water supply and will enjoyed an improved but yet rationed
service (that is, less hours of rationing); (iii) households that do not have access to water supply service and
will have it without rationing; (iv) households that do not have access to water supply service and will have
a rationed service; and (v) households who now enjoy service of poor quality and will see this quality
improve. Sewage collection and treatment related surveys were prepared differentiating between: (i)
households whose collected sewage is not treated; (ii) households that do not have access to sewage
collection in areas with in general acceptable water supply service; and (iii) households that do not have
access to sewage collection in areas with large pockets of water customers affected by rationing. In total,
2,176 households were interviewed.

Note:
(1) Non-applicable (NA). This service is currently not provided in this municipality.
The main issue affecting the water supply or sewerage, the estimated WTP and the WTP relation to the
municipality's average income are identified in Table 5. WTP estimates for provision of water supply and
sewage collection and treatment are 2.4 to 4.6 times higher than current tariffs. WTP to eliminate rationing
and improve water quality is lower than current tariffs (56 percent to 72 percent), except in Itabuna where
the large number of rationing hours faced by almost the whole population resulted in a WTP 1.24 times
higher than current tariffs. Joao Pessoa's WTP for sewage collection is high (2.4 times the current bill)
because the project area comprises high and medium-level income neighborhoods. The preservation of the



44
estuary of the Paraiba River, the main benefit of sewage treatment in Joao Pessoa, accrue to and satisfy the
entire population of the city. However, to avoid overestimating WTP for this service in this city, the survey
took place in areas that already have sewage collection service. Hence, the interest in having collection is
eliminatud and, perhaps more important, the survey took effect in relatively poorer neighborhoods.
For Canraru and Aracati, no WTP studies were available. WTP estimates were taken from the survey
localities most similar to those project areas, and hence adjusted for income levels.
Results
The introduction of willingness to pay and shadow prices to correct the financial flows of benefits and costs
improve the previous financial estimates. The entire sample would generate net benefits of about R$ 242
million. Apart from the water supply project in Caruaru, all water and sewerage projects are economically
viable (see Table 6).

With the exception of the water supply project in Joao Pessoa, the economic NPV is higher than the
financial NPV, due to the large positive externalities of the project which are not internalized in the market
prices of the services provided.4
VI. "Short-cut" Economic Analysis
As conversion factors not only include the impact of taxes and subsidies, but also other market distortions
(such as the high premiums received by water companies' employees), a so-called "short-cut" economic
analysis -was conducted to determine the net fiscal impact of the project. Under this method, economic
costs are calculated simply by subtracting taxes from and adding subsidies to the financial flow of costs,
while economic benefits are assumed equal to the financial flow of benefits. The 12 percent discount rate
used for both the financial and economic analyses is also used for the "short-cut" economic analysis.
4 The separation of OD and investment components of the water supply projects has not been conducted for the economic
analysis. A full fledged analysis could not be carried out due to the lack of data on the WTP for operational development
improvements. It is possible that the WTP for such improvement could be zero as customers have to pay (more) for
essentially the same level of service. For example, illegally connected customers have to pay the full price of water instead
of getting it for free



45
The results for the "short-cut" economic analysis confirm the results for the financial analysis (see Table
4). The entire sample would generate net benefits of R$ 153 million. With the exception of Caruaru, all
water supply projects improve in relation to the financial analysis.
Caruaru gets worse as a result of adding the R$ 5.4 million capital subsidy received from the state of
Pernambuco to complete the Vila de Prata dam. The estimated cost of this complementary work, which is
about 25 percent already built, has been added to the economic flow of costs because the benefits of
building the water transmission pipe (the main component of the Caruaru subproject) will only materialize
if the dam is completed. The profitability of all sewerage subprojects decreases. The impact of adding
electricity subsidies and, in particular, the capital subsidy to built these projects, more than offset the gains
obtained from removing taxes.

When the water supply projects are separated into the two different components, the conclusions drawn in
the financial analysis do not significantly alter. The OD projects are all feasible. When evaluated as
independent alternatives, the investment projects in Fortaleza and Santa Rita are viable, but the projects in
Caruaru, Itabuna and Joao Pessoa generate negative NPV (see Table 8). When the expansion and
rehabilitation (investment) projects are phased over time, and executed after the implementation of the
operational development components, the projects in Itabuna (net present benefit of R$ 0.50 million and a

of return of 25%) are economically feasible. Once again, as in the financial evaluation, only the investment
project in Caruaru remains unfeasible.

Fiscal Impact
The impact on government finances is positive. The nine subprojects in the sample have a positive net
fiscal impact equal to R$ 1:2 million (see Table 9). Although the subsidies are large, in particular the
capital subsidies for the sewerage projects (estimated at about R$ 5 million for the sample), the fiscal
transfers to the government through taxes during the construction and operation of the water and sanitation
facilities (estimated at R$ 25 million) more than offset them. Itabuna's water supply project, where the
transfer from taxes is negative due to higher O&M costs in the "without" project scenario than in the
"with" project scenario (in particular labor), is the only water supply project with a negative net fiscal
impact. In Joao Pessoa's sewerage project the electricity subsidy is zero as -- because of the chosen
technology -- no electricity consumption is expected.

Note:
* Capital subsidies are comprised of a federal subsidy equivalent to 50 percent of OECF capital financing for sewerage
subprojects, and in the case of Caruaru, a state subsidy of R$5.428 million (50 percent of the subproject cost) to
complete the "Vila do Prata" dam.
VII. Distributive Analysis
The distribution of positive externalities, the difference between the economic and financial cash flows, is
analyzed to determine who benefits from and who pays the cost of the project. The big winners are the
consumers, but society, government and workers also realize a good share of benefits from the positive
externalities (see Table 10).
Consumption externalities benefiting the consumers of water supply and sewage disposal services,
estimatod at R$ 64 million, result from the difference between the prices actually charged and the WTP for
these services. Consumption externalities arisen from the benefits realized by households who illegally
consume services were assumed to be negligible.
Society, which includes the customers of water supply and sewerage services and others inhabitants of
subproject areas, benefits primarily from the project's expected effect on curtailing environmental
pollution. Society benefits are estimated at about R$ 16 million based only on the expected impact of Joao
Pessoa's and Cuiaba's sewage treatment projects on the water bodies involved. Joao Pessoa's project will



47
help preserve the Rio Paraiba's estuary, a region full of mangroves with great touristic attractiveness.
Cuiaba's project will help preserve the Rio Cuiaba's beaches and the touristic neighborhoods that live from
the river. The importance that Joao Pessoa's and Cuiaba's inhabitants assign to the recuperation of the
water quality of their rivers explain their relative high WTP for sewage treatment. Society benefits are
however underestimated because only benefits accruing to households gaining access to sewage treatment
services have been quantified. Lack of information on how others inhabitants of subproject areas
(including the population living downstream of the rivers) would benefit from reduced water pollution did
allow to a more precise calculation.

The large environmental benefits generated by sewage disposal projects justify the federal policy of
awarding capital grants. The government decided to encourage both sewage collection and treatment
because of the large social benefits that result from a cleaner environment. A decision that already has
generated enthusiasm and new stakeholders in favor of protecting the water bodies of the region.
The government reaps direct financial benefits through the collection of taxes and tariffs that are imposed
on the inputs of the projects. Besides the direct fiscal impact, estimated at R$ 12 million, the utilities'
expected efficiency gains will certainly reduce the need of fiscal transfers to them. During the 1987-1996
decade, the first five state governments interested in the project (Ceara, Mato Grosso, Paraiba, Pemambuco
and Piaui) transferred an annual average of US$ 113 million to their water utilities. This remarkably large
amount of fiscal transfers illustrates the potential that exist for significant fiscal gains by improving water
utilities' efficiency.
The benefits to workers, estimated at R$ 9 million, come mostly in the form of wage premiums that public
water companies pay over the fair market for equivalent labor. In 1995, for example, the average annual
remuneration per employee paid by the state water companies was R$ 20,669 (about R$ 23,000 as of 1996
prices). As some subprojects are more labor-intensive than others, labor benefits differ across subprojects.
VIII. Poverty impact
It has been attempted in the distributive analysis to distinguish the consumer and society benefits accruing
to the poor and non-poor customers. This so-called poverty impact analysis measures how much of
consumer benefits and society benefits accrue to poor consumers.
Based on income data collected for the project areas during the willingness-to-pay surveys, calculations
were made assuming: (i) the income distribution will not change during the life of the project, (ii)



48
consumption differentials between poor and non-poor customers are negligible (that is, the lower per capita
water consumption of poor customers is largely offset by their larger household size); (iii) the net benefit to
5
poor consumers does not significantly differ from that of non-poor customers
As shown in Table 11, 67% of the benefits will accrue to the poor, 28% to the middle-income groups and
5% to the rich. This compares to a current income distribution in which the poor account for about 65% of
the population, the middle-income group for 31% and the rich for 4%. The poverty impact for the water
supply investments follows the pattern of the income distribution of the population. Yet, the poverty
impact of sewerage investments tends more to the poor. In the sewerage projects, 71% of the benefits
accrue ta, the poor, although they make up 64% of the population.

IX. Sensitivity and Risk Analysis
The sensitivity analysis shows that the WSM II project is a very robust project. The variables identified as
conveying major risk to the subprojects are: collection efficiency, changes in the unaccounted-for water
level, investment cost overruns, project delays, willingness to pay for new or improved services, and labor
productivity (as measured by the number of employees per 1,000 connections). Nonetheless, based on
single variable alterations, the sensitivity analysis shows that the NPV of feasible subprojects is unlikely to
become negative. For example, only the financial NPV of two subprojects becomes negative when the
collection rate (the most sensitive variable) remained unchanged during the entire life of the project; and to
have a negative financial NPV, the unaccounted-for water level of the less robust water supply project
should increase at least twelve percentage points. Table 12 summarizes the impact and risk significance of
the major risk variables.
The sensitivity analysis, however, works based on single variable changes in a static world. To enhance the
accuracy of the financial and economic analysis, the uncertainty of the real world is incorporated by using
the Crystal Ball risk analysis software. This software measures the extent of various risks and their effect
on the project, modeling a probable distribution for each risk variable and the resulting outcome. The
5 This assumption is likely to result in an underestimation of the benefits accruing to the poor, because of the reduction of
cross-subsidies expected from lthe project. Although the poor have a lower absolute willingness to pay for water and
sanitation services, the current tariff schedule benefits the poor through large cross subsidies. The water and sewerage bills
paid by the rich are 2 to 15 times as large as those paid by the povr, while the willingness to pay of the rich is about 1.5 to 7
times the willingness to pay of the poor.

assumptions and the corresponding probability distributions for the various risk variables have been
described in detail in the Project Files. Based on a simulation of 1,000 trials, the model recalculated the
results of the financial and economic analyses by changing the major risk variables all at the same time.

Collection Efficiency      Direct impact on revenues and profitability. Largely under management
control, this variable conveys a moderate risk to the projects.
Unaccounted for Water      Direct impact on operation and maintenance costs, indirect impact on
revenues as a decline in unaccounted for water has an impact similar to a
capacity increase. Largely under management control, conveys a variable
risk level to the projects. High in Itabuna, where the project's benefits are
highly dependent on a reduction of current levels. Very low in most
subprojects.
Investment Cost Overrun    Direct impact on investment costs. Largely under management control,
conveys a very low risk to the projects.
Project Delay              Direct impact on timing of investment costs. Largely under management
control, this is an almost risk-free variable in water subprojects and very
low risky in sewerage subprojects.
Willingness to Pay         Direct impact on benefits. Based on consumer's preferences and hence
_ largely beyond management control, this is a low risk variable.
Labor Productivity         Direct impact on operation and maintenance costs. Under management
control, is a very low risk variable.
Assumptions
An overrun of investment costs has a direct impact on the cost of the project. For this variable, a triangle
distribution is used. Assuming that the engineers accurately estimated the investment cost, the most likely
value for overruns is 0 percent. The minimum value is -20 percent, and the maximum value is 20 percent.
Project delays have an impact on benefits and costs. Because of project delays, benefits materialize later
than anticipated. The impact on costs occurs through the project's operation and maintenance costs, since
it has been assumed that a project delay does not affect expected investment costs. Because of project
delays, the expansion of capacity takes longer while the results of the project in the form of lower
unaccounted-for water occurs later than originally anticipated. Project delays are modeled according to the
following custom distribution:
Delay               Probabili
no delay                    50%
1 year delay                35%
2 years delay               15%
Changes in the unaccounted-for water (UFW) have an impact on the operation and maintenance costs of
the project. A decline in UFW has a similar impact than an increase in capacity. Assuming a standard
deviation that is dependent on the period under review, a lognormal distribution is used for this variable
according to the following schedule:



50
Period under review       Stindiard d eti
1996 - 1999                          5%
2000 - 2004                         10%
2005 - end of project               15%
Changes in the labor productivity have an impact on the operation and maintenance cost. For this variable,
a triangle distribution is used. The most likely value is determined by the engineers and varies from one
project to another. The minimum variable is the lowest company estimate (for the period between 1996 to
2004) minus 10 percent. The maximum variable is highest company estimate for the company plus 20
percent. For treatment projects, labor requirements are rather low (due to the selection of stabilization
ponds as the most favored technology) and the assumptions for labor productivity have been adjusted
accordingly.
Changes in collection efficiency are only used when determining the financial net present value. This
variable has a direct impact on the benefits of the project. A custom distribution has been used which
differs for each project due to the wide variances between the collection efficiency indices for the different
companies.
The willingness to pay for access to new or improved services is only used to determine the economic net
present value. A lognormal distribution has been used in this case, as WTP is expected to be positively
skewed. The WTP value can not drop below zero.
Financial Risk Assessment
The financial risk analysis confirms the robustness of the project. With the exception of the water supply
project in Caruaru, all water supply and sewerage projects show a very large probability of generating a
positive iNPV (the water supply project in Santa Rita showing the lowest probability of 80 percent), and
have large expected net cash flows (see Table 12). The sewerage projects are, in general, virtually risk-free
and will generate large positive net present values. The unusual result of having the sewerage subprojects
exhibiting a financial viability higher than that of the water supply projects is due to the 50 percent capital
investment subsidy given to these projects by the federal government.

The financial risk analysis indicates that when all risk variables are analyzed simultaneously in a dynamic
world, the two most important variables impacting the projects' financial net cash flow are labor
productivity and collection efficiency. This is an important finding since these two variables can and
should be controlled by the management of the water companies. Cost overruns, project delays and
unaccounted for water (in water supply projects) are less important.
Economic Risk Assessment
The economic risk analysis shows that all projects, again with the exception of the water supply project in
Caruaru, are risk free (all of them have a 100 percent probability of generating a positive NPV) and have
very large expected net present values (see Table 13).
In contrast to the financial risk analysis, in the economic risk analysis the relative importance of risk
variables show large differences between projects. In the water supply projects, labor productivity is the
most important variable in Caruaru, Fortaleza and Itabuna. In Joao Pessoa and Santa Rita, project delays
have the most impact. The willingness to pay for new and/or improved services turns out to be an
important assumption. And the impact of cost overruns is in general negligible with the exception of
Caruaru and Itabuna. Meanwhile, for the sewerage projects, the results are most sensitive to changes in the
willingness to pay.
When the different project components are evaluated as interdependent alternatives under a "short-cut"
economic analysis (instead of a full-fledged economic analysis), the expansion and rehabilitation projects in
Caruaru and Itabuna should not be implemented. Although the project in Itabuna generates a net benefit,
the risks associated with the execution of this project are very high.
X. Conclusions
Based on the results of the analysis, the criteria for undertaking the different type of activities that can be
financed under the project were defined. Operational development programs should be financially viable to
undertake as the major reason to undertake these programs is to improve the financial viability of the
company. The criterion for undertaking rehabilitation and expansion water supply and sewage collection
investments is that these investments should be "short-cut" economically viable, because in general these
type of investments will generate large individual benefits. The externalities associated with the provision
of water supply and sewerage services to the poor and sewage treatment are in general expected to be large.
The criterion for these types of projects should therefore be that they are economically viable.
When applying these criteria on the sample of projects that were evaluated, the operational development
programs are all financially viable, and hence can be implemented. Except for the water supply project in
Caruaru, all water supply and sewerage projects are "short-cut" economically viable. Yet, although the
water supply project in Itabuna is viable, the risks associated with the execution of this project are very
high, and it is therefore recommended not to implement this project. The two sewage treatment projects are
economically viable, and hence because of the large external benefits they generate, should be implemented.

Financial Summary for Revenue Earning Project Entities
Objective
The objective of the financial analysis at the level of utilities is threefold: (i) to determine the financial
capacity of the utilities to service the Bank loan and to provide counterpart funds in a timely manner; (ii) to
determine the utilities' eligibility levels today and in the future, which are determined by a group of
financial. indicators; and (iii) to identify the additional actions which need to be taken by the utilities to
improve the eligibility levels. In addition, in the case of SANEMAT, the state water company of Mato
Grosso, which will be dismantled and privatized (most likely municipal concessions), we conducted an
additional analysis to measure the long-term incremental benefit of such reforn to different stakeholders.
Methodology
During A4ppraisal, we carried out a detailed analysis of a sample of seven utilities, the initial group of
utilities which expressed interest in participating in the project. The following tasks were carried out for the
sample utilities:
*  analysis of historical and current financial status
*  determination of eligibility level today
* preparation of financial projections (base scenario)
*  sensitivity analysis
*  identification of main risks and recommended actions by utilities
*  analysis of long-term incremental benefit from reform/PSP of SANEMAT
The future project participants within the scope of the project (North, Northeast, and Centerwest) will be
analyzed by the project management unit following the same methodology.

Histori,cal and Current Financial Status of the Water Utilities
Recent history. Most Brazilian water utilities experienced financial difficulties during the hyperinflationary
period during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Frequent tariff freezes imposed by the Government made it
impossible for the utilities to recover rapidly increasing costs. To make the ends meet, most utilities stopped



53
paying taxes and energy bills, while debts in arrears snowballed. Meanwhile, strong labor unions and
outdated salary structure increased the personnel costs steadily.
Changing environment. With the implementation of the Real Plan, most utilities were allowed to increase
the tariff levels by 20% to 60% in real terms between 1993 and 1996. Despite a more favorable operating
environment, however, the financial situation of the utilities remains difficult. The long period of economic
instability left the utilities with a large amount of debts and payments in arrears, and with very limited
financial management and planning capacity.
The Brazilian water utilities (especially state water companies) today are characterized by the following:
a)  High operating costs. Cost control is weak at best. Many functions are centralized in the
headquarters, one of the reasons for high administration costs. In the recent years, cost of third-party
labor increased substantially, as the utilities started to reduce the number of regular employees.
b)  High personnel costs and aginz employees. Although many of the utilities reduced the number of
employees through voluntary retirement plans in the recent years, personnel costs still account for
more than fifty percent of the operating cost (except for the municipal utilities). Many utilities are
reviewing the salary structures which are based on years of service, and not on performnance, to
correct the problem.
c)  Tight liquidity/cash situation. Although operating margins of the utilities improved in the recent years
thanks mainly to the increase in tariff, most utilities still suffer from tight cash situation. Bill
collection rates are not ideal (between 65% to 90%/o), and payments for the accumulated taxes and
energy bills remain high.
d)  Increasing debts and large investment needs. The debt-equity ratios of these utilities today are low.
T-his represents the fact that the utilities have long depended on government transfers for investments.
Most of the utilities' long-term debts were assumed by the state governments (and accounted for as
capital injection). With tighter budgetary control exercised by the government in the recent years, the
utilities can no longer depend on government transfers for investments. Facing a large investment
backlog, the utilities are starting to look for other sources of financing.
Eligibility Levels of the Utilities Analyzed. The eligibility status of the companies based on 1996
proforma financial statements are as follows. (See Annex 2 for eligibility criteria). Of the three companies
which are currently not eligible for any investment components, SANEMAT has already taken the decision
to opt for the "reform route".

** All four indicators must qualify for a certain level of eligibility.
Financial Projections (Base Case)
Based cn the historical data and 1996 estimates, we prepared the financial projections for the seven utilities
for years 1997-2003. The projections were prepared on a conservative estimate of gradual efficiency gains
and considering the benefits from the investment programs, including those financed by the project. The
financial projections and financial ratios of selected utilities are presented in Attachment 1.
Main Assumptions. The main assumptions for the financial projections are summarized below. The more
detailed assumptions specific to each of the utilities are presented in the financial assessment report
available in the Project Files together with the diskettes containing the financial projections model.
Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis was conducted on selected critical factors affecting the utility operations. We measured
the impact of the changes in these factors to: (i) the utilities' financial eligibility status (the combination of
the four indicators); and (ii) the utilities' self financing capacity. The scenarios we analyzed are:
Results and Recommendations. Selected results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in Attachment 2.
The detailed results of the analysis are available in the Project Files. As a result of the sensitivity analysis,
we could identify specific actions the utilities need to take to achieve better financial performance, and



55
hence obtain a better eligibility status. A summary of the recommendations for each of the seven utilities
are presented in Attachment 3.
The sensitivity analysis indicates that the companies financial capacity (internal cash generation, and other
selected indicators) is most sensitive to the changes in revenue and operating costs. In reality, however,
further increase in tariff level is not possible. Except for CAGECE, which has one of the lowest levels of
tariff in Brazil, most water companies analyzed have already raised the tariff levels to the limit.

Note: In addition to these standard scenarios, we analyzed additional scenarios specific to each utility,
where deemed necessary.
For most companies analyzed, reduction of operating cost is the most effective way to improve the financial
performance. Fixed costs, including personnel and administrative overhead costs, account for nearly 80%
of the total operating costs (not including depreciation). The companies can become substantially
financially self-sufficient, if they can reduce such fixed costs.
Although reduction of unaccounted-for water helps improve the financial performance, the impact is not as
immediate and large as reduction in operating costs. Unaccounted-for water (UFW) reduction would
reduce the cost of production, and allow the water companies to postpone large investments in the
production capacity. However, since the cost of production is not so large (about 20% of total operating



56
cost), cornpared with administrative overhead costs, and UFW programs in fact increases the cost of
operation and maintenance in the short-run, the impact of UFW reduction to the companies' cash
generation is minimal.
Tariff collection rates can have a considerable impact to the internal cash generation when the current
collection rates are extremely low. In the case of COMPESA, which collects 82% of the bills from the
private sector, and mere 10% from the public sector (public sector accounts for about 10% of total
revenue), the impact of improving collection rates are sizable (US$60 million in 10 years). For others with
fairly high collection rates, the impact is minimal.
Incremenital Benefit of Reform/PSP to Different Stakeholders -- The Case of Cuiaba, the State of
Mato Grosso
SANEMAT, the state water company of Mato Grosso is a candidate for the "reform route" (see project
eligibility criteria in Annex 2). The state government decided to dismantle its state water company,
SANEMAT, and to reform the sector through municipalization and private sector participation. Since the
main outcome of the project in this case is "reform", we attempted to measure the benefit of reform, rather
than conclucting a conventional ratio analysis. The parallel objective of this exercise was to determine how
each grotup of stakeholders benefit differently depending upon how the concession contract is awarded and
structured. The stakehoders analyzed are: the Government (municipal, state, and Federal), company as a
business, company shareholders, and the existing customers. Table 5 presents the main stakeholders in the
reform process, and their costs and benefits.
We realize that there are some other stakeholders not analyzed here, such as employees, new customers,
etc. We also realize that there may be some benefits that are shared by more than one stakeholders. The
main puipose of this exercise, nonetheless, was to measure the magnitude of the direct financial impact of
reform to the major stakeholders.
Me tho do , o
Tle tasLks we developed were as follows:
a)  Construct the financial statements of the water company of Cuiaba (the most likely target for
privatization) by allocating assets, liabilities, income, and costs that pertain to the respective
muricipality.
b)  Prepare the financial projections for the next 30 years under five scenarios: four with Reform/PSP and
one without Reform/PSP.
c) Allocate the costs and benefits to different stakeholders, under each scenarios (see table below).
d)  Calculate the incremental net benefits from reform for each of the four "reform" scenarios.

*Cost of rationing was calculated based on the assumptions that: (i) low income customers pay the water truck (estimated at
R$5. 7/rn) when there is rationing; (ii) middle to high income customers install and maintain water tanks (cost estimated at
RgO. 77/rn in addition to tariffpayment). A more detailed description of how we determined each cost and benefit component
is available in the Project Files.
Scenarios Analvzed
We analyzed four different scenarios which are the likely outcome of SANEMAT's reform, in comparison
with "without" PSP/reform scenario.
SANEMAT debts paid by:
Concessionaire              Municipality
Economic bid based on:    License fee    Base Scenario               Scenario 2
Tariff        Scenario 3                   Scenario 4
Under all scenarios, the water and sanitation service currently provided by SANEMAT will become the
responsibility of the municipality of Cuiaba. The municipality of Cuiaba will then bid out the water and
sewerage utility concession to the private sector under reform/PSP scenarios. For all reforn/PSP scenarios,
we assumed that the investors (shareholders) of the concession company will expect to earn at least 25% on
invested capital. We assumed therefore, that the winning concessionaire would offer an annual license fee
payment or a tariff reduction that equates their return on capital to 25%.
Under the base scenario, the concession will be bid out on annual "canon" or license fee payment to the
municipality, not on tariff discount. SANEMAT's existing debts (which corresponds to Cuiba) will be paid
by the winning concessionaire in ten years. Scenario 2 is the same as Base scenario, except that
SANEMAT's existing debts will be paid by the municipality.
Under Scenarios 3 and 4, the concession will be bid out on tariff reduction. SANEMAT's debts are paid
by the concessionaire under scenario 3, and by the municipality under scenario 4. Under "without
reform/PSP scenario", we assume business as usual with SANEMAT's existing inefficiency carried
forward to the municipal utility.

Summary of Results
The results of the analysis confirmed that all main stakeholders benefit from reform (see Attachment 4).
Without reform/PSP all stakeholders incur losses, except for the state government which collect some value
added tax from water sale. The results also showed that depending upon how the bids are structured, some
stakeholders benefit more than others. It also showed that overall financial gains can be maximized by
choosing a certain option over others.
The municipality must make a decision on how much of the efficiency gains it wants to share with the
water users (customers). If the concession is bid out on a license fee (canon), and no tariff reduction is
granted, then the water users' benefits are limited to reduced rationing and perhaps better service (scenarios
1 and 2). If, on the other hand, the concession is bid out on tariff reduction, this in effect implies that the
municipality is passing on most of the efficiency gains to the water users (scenario 3 and 4). The results
indicated that the customers' benefits can double, if tariff reduction is granted, even though overall benefits,
especially the benefits to the Government, are reduced. Alternatively, the municipality can use the license
fee to create a "subsidy fund" to extend the service to the poor. In this case, although the benefit to the
existing customers may be reduced (compared with the tariff reduction scenario), the efficiency gains are
transferred to the new and generally poor customers.
Another critical decision the municipality must take is the issue of SANEMAT's outstanding debts. If the
municipality makes the winning concessionaire assume the debts, then the cost is eventually passed on to
the customers (scenario 3 vs. scenario 4).
The speciific results can be summarized as follows:
* Of the four reform/PSP scenarios, base scenario and scenario 2 - bid on license fee -- maximizes the
total benefits to the stakeholders. The difference between the two scenarios are minimal in terms of



59
overall benefits. The municipality gains more under the base scenario because it does not have to pay
SANEMAT's debts, even though annual license fee income is higher under scenario 2. The benefits
to the customers are the same under both scenarios, and are limited to benefits arising from not having
rationing.
* The benefits to the customers are the highest under scenario 4, even though the overall benefits are the
lowest. Under this scenario, the concessionaire will bid at a 15% discount to the existing tariff, and
still earn 25% return on invested capital. Larger tariff discounts are granted, because the winning
concessionaire does not have to pay back SANEMAT's debts. The reduction in tariff increases the
benefits to the customers, but reduces the benefits to the Government at all levels. The lower tariff
reduces the revenue from income tax and value added tax. In addition, there will be no license fee
income to the municipality under this scenario.

Annex 6
Water Sector Modernization II
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
A. Procurement
Procurement of consultant services will be done according to the provisions of the "Guidelines for the Selection
and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (January 1997) and of goods and works according to
the provisions of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans" (January 1995, revised January and August
1996).
All contracts which can be packaged to exceed the equivalent of US$5 million for civil works and US$350,000 for
equipment or materials will be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) following the
above mentioned guidelines for procurement. All other contracts for civil works and equipment or materials not
exceeding the aggregate amounts of about US$32.0 million and US$2.9 million, respectively, will be procured
under nationally advertised national competitive bidding (NCB) and shopping procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Shoppingt will be an accepted method of procurement of goods estimated to cost less than US$100,000 per contract,
up to an aggregate amount of US$1.2 million. Three quotations will be an accepted method of procurement of
small works estimated to cost less than US$350,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$1.5 million.
Table A and Table B present the procurement arrangements and thresholds, respectively. Shopping and three
quotations are presented under Other Procurement Methods in Table A.
Subloans to finance goods, works and consultants services will be available to private operators selected under ICB.
The private operators would be responsible for the procurement of works and goods under their own procedures.

1/ Exemption from prior review does not apply to consultants contracts below the thresholds in case of single source selection of firms,
assigmnents of critical nature, and arnendments to contracts raising original contract value above the thresholds.
B. Disbursement
Of the total US$300 million project, 85% is being financed by the Bank, with respect to the water supply and
services components, and 85% by the OECF, regarding the sewerage component. The water utility companies will
finance the remaining 15% of all the components, as the required counterpart funding.
The Government through the executing agencies will establish a Special Account in the amount of US$ 10 million,
in order to expedite project execution. The relatively large size of the Special Account is justified by about US$45
million of bidding contracts already submitted to the Bank, all of them 85% financiable. The executing agency, by
use of the Special Account, will make payments directly to consultants and suppliers. Expenditures for individual
contracts of goods and services, for which prior review by the Bank is not required will be disbursed against
Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). Detailed supporting documentation, including certification, for expenditures
will be kept by the PMU and submitted to the Bank. Full documentation for all contracts requiring the Bank's
prior review will be submitted. Detailed documentation will be retained by the companies and PMU for inspection
during supervision missions and for audit by the external auditors of MAS and SWCs. No force account is
envisaged and the Closing Date will be June 30, 2003. Allocation of loan proceeds is presented in Table C.
C. Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing
Advance contracting, about US$20.0 million, and retroactive financing, about US$10.0 million, which represents
13.3% and 6.7% of the total loan, respectively, will be provided for eligible expenditures incurred after March 14,
1997, or a date twelve months before the signing date of the Loan Agreement. The eligible expenditures will
consist of services which support the objectives/components of the project, as stated in Block 1, Sections 1 and 2
and Annex 2. Advance contracting and retroactive financing must follow Bank procurement and consultant
guidelines. In order to ensure timely implementation of the project and loan disbursement, SEPURB provided to



72
the Bank with bidding documents for subprojects expected to be eligible for retroactive financing and terms of
reference for selected studies and technical assistance.
