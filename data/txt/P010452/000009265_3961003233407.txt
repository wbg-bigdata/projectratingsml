Borrower:                Islamic Republic of Pakistan
Beneficiaries:           Province of Sindh (GOS)
Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC)
Karachi Development Authority (KDA)
Three interior cities: Larkana, Nawabshah and Mirpurkhas
Amount:                  SDR 33.3 million (US$46.8 million equivalent)
Tenms:                   Standard, with 35 years maturity
Relending Terms:         From the Government of Pakistan  (GOP) to the GOS on
standard IDA terms. GOS will pass the proceeds of the
credit to KDA, KMC, and three interior cities on the
same terms as received from GOP.
Project Obiectives:      The objectives of the project are to support the first
five years of GOS's policy reform program for the urban
sector and municipal government by: (a) financing an
immediate action plan to begin to deal with some of the
most urgent environmental and infrastructure problems in
Karachi and three interior cities; (b) supporting GOS's
newly created policy-making machinery in implementing
its program of fiscal and administrative reforms;  (c)
initiating institutional strengthening for two key urban
services organizations in Karachi, namely KDA and KMC;
and (d) preparing engineering studies for future
transport improvements in Karachi.
Benefits and Risks:      The benefits of the physical components of the proposed
project will include: improved environmental and health
conditions of the urban population, especially those
living in the low-income Korangi area; increased land
values in the upgraded areas; cost savings, such as
reduced   maintenance   costs   for   various   urban
infrastructure components and lower vehicle operating
costs for urban transport. The benefits of the policy
reforms will be in terms of improvements in fiscal and
financial efficiency and capacity of GOS to finance
investment and cover recurrent costs of meeting the
growing demand for urban infrastructure.   There are
serious law and order risks in Sindh and Karachi, but
they are believed to be manageable and IDA's support
fully justified given GOP and GOS's strong commitment to
the project and Karachi's role in Pakistan's economy.
Possibility of delays in implementation, particularly
implementation of the policy and institutional reform
measures will be mitigated through institutional
strengthening of the executing agencies.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
SINDH SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
Background
1.1       Since the early 1980s, Pakistan has liberalized its economy and has
adopted a more outward-oriented development strategy. As a result, real Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) has increased by more than 61 per annum over the last
decade. This growth has been associated with a shift in the structure of the
economy away from agriculture and traditional small scale manufacturing toward
a more urban-based industrial and service economy, thus fueling a rapid
urbanization process where the population in Pakistan's towns and cities is
growing at about 4.7% per year.
1.2       The Government of Pakistan (GOP) has found it difficult to mobilize
sufficient resources to keep its fiscal and balance of payments deficits within
acceptable ranges. Thus, public investments have been lagging behind the rapidly
growing demand. As a consequence, the social and physical infrastructure of the
country is inadequate, as reflected in poor social indicators-/ and in shortages
in water supply, sanitation, energy, transport, communications, and shelter. In
the major cities, this is reflected in rapidly growing slum areas, worsening air
and water pollution and increasing traffic congestion.
1.3       Although most cities and towns in Pakistan suffer from these problems,
nowhere are these deficiencies as conspicuous as in Karachi, the country's
largest city. With about ten million people today, its population has increased
nine-fold since 1950, making Karachi one of the fastest growing "mega-cities"I in
the world. The city produces about 20% of Pakistan's GDP and the contribution
of its small and large enterprises to overall economic growth is significantly
greater than that of the whole agricultural sector. Shortages in infrastructure
that reduce the productivity of urban enterprises, therefore, have a high
economic cost to the country.
1.4       The urban crisis in Pakistan is largely a result of an outdated legal
and institutional framework, and a system for resource mobilization and
investment allocation that has not been adapted to the challenges faced by
Pakistan's rapidly urbanizing centers. Legal and institutional weaknesses have
introduced severe distortions on land and shelter markets. As a result, there
are more than 250,000 developed plots lying unutilized in Karachi while, at the
same time, about four million of its citizens live in unserviced katchi abadis
or informal squatter settlements.
1.5       The fiscal system has been unable to recycle the considerable wealth
that has been generated in the urban centers of the country.   Poor public
resource mobilization at all levels of government and overall budget constraints,
combined with a fiscal system which is top heavy, has resulted in urban
infrastructure investments declining in real terms. Although the award of the
National Finance Commission has set up a system of automatic transfers to the
provinces, little of these resources reaches the municipal governments who have
to rely on meager and inelastic revenue sources. Indeed, municipal governments
1/    Reflected in, inter alia, low literacy (35%), high population growth
(3.1%), and infant mortality at 97 per 1000 live births.



-2-
collect only one-twentieth of all public revenues and account for an equally
small percentage of expenditures.
1.6       This has led IDA to conclude that the urban crisis in Pakistan cannot
be resolved unless changes are made in the legal, institutional and fiscal
frameworks.-   These reforms need to take place primarily at the provincial
level.  According to Pakistan's constitution, the provincial governments are
mainly responsible for urban development.
1.7       With slightly over half of its 28.6 million people living in cities
and towns,  Sindh is more urbanized than the other provinces.   Thus,  the
Government of Sindh (GOS) is leading the way in adopting new policies to deal
with the urban problem.   In spite of continued political turmoil,  GOS has
developed an agenda of policy and regulatory reforms over the last few years that
focus on decentralization, deregulation, privatization and resource mobilization
to improve urban public services in Sindh.
1.8       In order to effectively implement these reforms and to develop new
policy options as the situation evolves and new experiences are gained, GOS has
created a new framework for policy development and implementation. Three levels
of policy analysis and review are involved: through ad-hoc working groups from
concerned department at the technical level; a Secretaries Sub-Committee at the
administrative level; and a Cabinet Committee at the political level. The newly
created Executive Policy Action and Coordination Organization (EXPACO) serves as
secretariat to the Cabinet Committee.
1.9       The proposed project would support these policy and institutional
changes while at the same time finance an immediate action plan to begin to deal
with (a) environmental degradation in Karachi and (b) traffic congestion in
Karachi and three interior cities. It would also help prepare for the longer
term through engineering studies for future urban transport and infrastructure
improvements in Karachi and road and transport infrastructure improvements in the
interior cities.
Hi. THE URBAN SECTOR IN PAKISTAN
A. Country Backound
Economic Trends
2.1       Until 1980, Pakistan was a regulated economy with highly administered
prices and credit, regulated investments, and protectionist trade policies. The
Government was also a major owner of banks, other financial institutions, and
manufacturing enterprises.   Since then, however, Pakistan has moved steadily
toward an outward oriented market economy. Over the last couple of years, the
government has privatized public sector banks and enterprises, reformed exchange
controls, improved taxation, and promoted exports.
2.2       Real GDP grew by more than 6% per annum during the 1980s, primarily
led by the manufacturing sector and supported by good performance of the
agricultural sector.   This growth appears to be continuing.   Nevertheless,
2/    This is consistent with the Bank's global experience, as reflected in the
Bank's policy paper on urbanization "Urban Policy and Economic
Development--An Agenda for the 1990s."



Pakistan has found it difficult to keep fiscal and balance of payments deficits
within stable ranges, and in 1990/91 the budget deficit reached 8.8% of GDP, a
record that might be exceeded for 1992/93. The savings and investment rates of
the cotntry are exceptionally low for a country at Pakistan's income level. The
relatively rapid economic growth has been associated with a shift in the
structure of the economy away from agriculture and traditional small scale
manufacturing towards increasingly urban based industrial and service activities.
Thus, the demand for most infrastructure services has been growing much more
rapidly than either population or GDP. As a consequence, the social and physical
infrastructure of the country is inadequate, as reflected in shortages in water
supply, sanitation, energy, transport, and communications.

of Sindh by the year 2000 is pro-
jected to reach about 36 million or I
25% of Pakistan's total population
with its urban population growing to about 20 million or 56% of Sindh's total
population.   In terms of percent share of urbanization, Sindh is followed by
Punjab, with Northwest Frontier, and Balochistan following in that order.
2.6       Karachi.   With about  9% of the   national  popula:tion,  Karachi's
economic weight exceeds that of any other city in Pakistan arid dominates the
economy of Sindh.  The 1993 population is about 10 million :nd is ozojected to
grow to 14.5 million (or about '.0% of the national populatio..     - -ie year 2000.
Karachi accounts for about 20% of Pakistan's GDP and is the co nr      l _ largest and
most industrialized city.  It also accounts for 42% of valu- added and 35% of
employment in large scale manufacturing, 72% of capital issued and 40% of tax
revenues nationally. GDP per capita for Karachi is estimated to be more than
US$1,200. With only about 35% of the provincial population, it has over 73% of
the average daily reported manufacturing employment in Sindh, and accounts for
over 70% of value added in manufacturing and over 60% cf Sindh's estimated Gross
Regional Product (GRP).
2.7       Karachi's problems have, with few exceptions, worsened over the years.
In 1988, 36% of the city's households lived below the poverty level.  Recent
estimates put the percentage of households below the poverty level, at about 40%.
Recent estimates also indicate that water and sewerage service levels in Karachi
have remained almost constant for the past decade. Average availability of water
is about 35 gallons per capita per day, which is low for cities in developing
countries with similar per capita incomes.   Sixty percent of households have
water connections, but receive water for only three to four hours a day.
Intermittent water supply has raised the cost of delivered water to households
and firms by requiring installation of individual storage facilities. About 40%
of all households are connected to the sewerage system, but only a small fraction
of biological waste is treated.  There are serious deficiencies in Karachi's
transportation system, with a gradual worsening of traffic congestion and
incidence of personal injury. Katchi abadis (informal settlements) grew at twice
the rate of urbanization nationally, and now more than 40% of the occupied land
is outside the tax net. Somewhere between 3.5 and 4.0 million people live in
3/    During the 1980s, liberalization of the economy and political turmoil in
Sindh have put the Province of Punjab slightly ahead of Sindh in terms of
growth.  Although Punjab has only about a 35% share of the total urban
population for 1993, its average annual growth during the period 1981 to
1993 was 4.9% and is expected to continue as the interior cities in the
province gain more dynamism.



these squatter or slum communities, where health and education services are
inadequate. !/
2.8       The four primary problem areas in infrastructure are: water supply
(per capita water production is projected to decline over the next two decades
even after significant capital investment and water loss reduction effort);
public transport (the mass transport system is heavily utilized and over-loaded,
with an estimated shortfall of about 2,000 buses and minibuses); environmental
upgrading (katchi abadi households and industrial wastes continue to pollute the
environment); and shelter (katchi abadis in Pakistan reflect the absence of an
enabling environment that is capable of dealing with the institutional
constraints in the sub-sector).
2.9       The Interior Cities.  Besides Karachi, there are more than 100 cities
and towns in Sindh, with a total population of about four million.   The two
largest (Hyderabad and Sukkur) have municipal corporations, 33 have municipal
committees, and 113 have town committees. Hyderabad (estimated 1987 population
850,000), Sukkur (220,000), and Larkana (178,000), are Division Headquarters.
Larkana, Mirpurkhas  (167,000), Nawabshah (119,000), Shikarpur (101,000), and
Jacobabad (just under 100,000) are District headquarters. There are nine other
towns and cities with populations over 40,000 in 1987.  There is substantial
variation in economic potential and growth prospects among the interior cities
of Sindh.  Ten cities have growth rates of over 4% per year, while six cities
grew at an average rate of less than 2%. Hyderabad and Sukkur have stagnated
economically and subsist largely on a traditional economy of small commerce,
artisans,  and personal services.-/  During the past three decades,  the two
cities grew at average rates of less than 3.0% per annum, whereas Karachi grew
at more than 5% per year.
2.10      Basic services in the interior cities lag behind demand and urban
expansion, and facilities are in poor repair. For example, in Mirpurkhas traffic
congestion has become a major problem and the overall condition of sewerage
drainage is unsatisfactory; almost 30% of dwellings have no access to either open
drains or underground sewers.   Underground sewers are poorly maintained and
blocked at many locations with effluent constantly spilling onto public roads and
walkways.  only 50% of the city's refuse gets collected.  Uncollected refuse
litters the streets and clogs the drains, causing serious health and environmen-
tal problems.
2.11      With few exceptions,  the interior urban areas have virtually been
ignored by the Sindh government. Present inter-governmental relations have not
provided the proper incentives to strengthen municipal governments, mobilize
resources, or make more efficient use of their resources.
4/     Infant mortality rates in poor urban areas are well above the national
average of 97 deaths per 1000 live births and the same is true for
maternal mortality. Nearly 50% of all (urban and rural) children under
age five have some kind of nutritional deficiency. Diarrhea and parasitic
infestations are by far the major causes of death among children (0-5
years) in selected Karachi squatter settlements. See Pakistan: A Profile
of Poverty, World Bank: Reoort Number 8848-PAK. August 31, 1990.

C. Sector OrgWzation
Federal Institutions
2.12      Responsibility for urban development policy is split between federal
and provincial levels of government, while implementation is almost the exclusive
responsibility of the provincial governments and, to a limited extent, the
municipalities constituted under them. At the federal level, the responsibility
for coordinating urban and regional policies is divided between the Ministry of
Local Government and Rural Development (MLG&RD) and the Environment and Urban
Affairs Division (E&UA) of the Ministry of Housing and Works. Both agencies play
leading roles in developing urban sector plans for the five year development
plans, and in setting and monitoring service targets and sectoral budgets. Their
major strength is their role in facilitating funding proposals through the
Federal Government bureaucracy, and in coordinating occasional policy studies.
Their major weakness is their lack of leadership in formulating and implementing
an overall vision and policy framework for the sector and which reflects broad
acknowledgement of the urban crisis and general agreement on a strategy for
dealing with it.
2.13      The Planning Commission and the Ministry of Finance have direct
influence on urban affairs, as they impact provincial expenditure patterns
through two major methods: preparation and supervision of five year development
plans and budgets, and fiscal transfers and loans to the provinces. Five year
plans and budgets constitute the overall framework for review and approval of all
major public investments which are financed through loans and grants from the
Federal Government, and as such influence investment priorities of the provinces.
Intergovernmental fiscal authority is centralized at the center which generally
limits the scope for managing provincial expenditures efficiently.   Urban
projects in excess of Rs 100 million are technically reviewed by the Planning
Commission (after prior review by the provinces), and before final review and
approval by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC).1b
2.14      The Federal Government has a fragmented but pervasive influence on
urban development in cities like Karachi. It is by far the dominant land owner;
the Ministry of Defense has developed cantonment housing for active and retired
military personnel. These cantonments, with 25' of the city's area and 51 of its
population, function as enclaves, responsible for construction, operation and
maintenance of much of the basic infrastructure such as water supply and sewerage
disposal. Pakistan Railways and the federally owned and operated Karachi Port
Trust are major land owners, as are public enterprises such as Pakistan Steel
Corporation and National Refineries, Ltd. The Ministry of Transport also plays
an active role in urban transport planning and investment in the four provincial
capital cities of Karachi, Lahore, Quetta, and Peshawar. Major trunk roads that
connect the Karachi Port with the major cities to the north are constructed by
the National  Highway Authority.    Its predominantly national  interest  has
seriously constrained municipal planning and coordination for road construction
6/    ECNEC  consists  of  the  Minister  of  Finance  as  chairman  and  the
Ministers of agriculture, water and power, science and technology,
communications, information and broadcasting, the proponent ministry, and
the Governors/Chief Secretaries of the four provincial governments. ECNEC
is the executive committee for the National Economic Council, the highest
authority to approve the Five Year Plan and Annual Development Program.

and maintenance. All survey and mapping for development planning purposes is
undertaken by the Surveyor of Pakistan. Its limited capacity has meant that all
maps are seriously out of date and virtually useless as planning tools.  The
operations of these federal agencies preclude efficient and comprehensive
municipal management not only in Karachi but in all of the major cities of
Pakistan.
Provincial Institutions
2.15      The structure and function of government at the provincial level
essentially reflects the federal level. As shown below, the Sindh government is
organized into 7 administrative and 13 line departments and the Sindh Environmen-
tal Protection Agency (SEPA) . Its administrative departments include a Planning
and Development Department (P&D), which is responsible for coordination of
development planning and budgeting, and for financing major urban infrastructure
projects for all but the three larger Sindh municipalities of Karachi, Hyderabad
and Sukkur; and Departments of Finance and Excise and Taxation, and Board of
Revenue (BOR) which are responsible for the financial and fiscal management,
resource mobilization, and land management functions of GOS, respectively. Along
with P&D, these last three departments maintain GOS's core functions.   The
administrative departments of Information and Legal (affairs) are concerned with
dissemination of information to the public and with preparation of new
legislation and supervision of all legal matters pertaining to provincial
government affairs in Sindh, respectively. The General Services and Adminis-
tration Department is responsible for maintenance of GOS's plant and equipment
as well as seeing that the administrative systems of GOS function properly and
according to government rules of business. The line departments for the sector
include the Department of Local Government and Rural Development (LG&RD) which
oversees municipal government activity, including those of Karachi Metropolitan
Corporation (KMC), and Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB).  In parallel with
GOS's renewed interest in strengthening provision of urban infrastructure in the
interior cities, the Housing, Town Planning and Environment Department (HTP&E)
has been recently separated from the LG&RD.   HTP&E now serves municipal
governments in their town planning requirements, oversees shelter and urban
infrastructure including the Karachi and Hyderabad Development Authorities, and
overseas the requlatory work of SEPA under the Federal Environmental Protection
Act of 1987, and functions under the administrative and policy framework of the
E&UA at the federal level. LG&RD is responsible for the structure, guidance and
basic infrastructure development of municipal governments and functions under the
overall policy framework that has been established by the MLG&RD.   GOS's
Department of Transport is involved through its function of coordination of
overall provincial and municipal transport policies for urban and regional areas,
and its overall oversight responsibilities of the Karachi Transport Corporation
(KTC), and the Sindh Road Transport Corporation (a regional bus service), both
loss-making public entities owned and operated by the GOS.
2.16      These functions are performed in five administrative divisions into
which the province has been divided: (a) Karachi; (b) West Southern Sindh
headquartered in Hyderabad; (c) East Southern Sindh in Mirpurkhas; (d) East
Northern Sindh in Sukkur; and (e) West Northern Sindh in Larkana. The Karachi
Division covers four Karachi districts (east, west, south and central) and the
other four divisions cover eighteen districts.   Divisional Commissioners and
coordinating committees report to the Governor.

2.17      The role of the provincial government in the provision of municipal
services varies with city size. In the larger cities of Sindh (metropolitan and
municipal corporations), the provincial government is supposed to be only
partially involved in development and maintenance of urban infrastructure and
services. In practice, GOS is involved in basic infrastructure generally through
financing of projects executed by development authorities that have been set up
in the larger cities.  In medium sized cities and smaller towns, provincial
government involvement is comprehensive in that they are involved more actively
in personnel recruitment and direct administration.
2.18      Centralization of administration in GOS has had the effect of stifling
the initiative of municipal governments in the province.  GOS procedures for
development administration suffer from a lack of long-term perspective premised
on sound economic and financial policies, an effective program budgeting system,
and qualified staff to manage the project cycle.   Environmental issues in
infrastructure development, operations and maintenance are not addressed by GOS
in any systematic way.   These will require attention and resources.   SEPA
operates with a limited staff and program, and has been very slow in establish-
ing and carrying out its role, partly because of lack of regulations and
standards for effective management of the environment, but also because of non-
existent or weak enforcement policies and practices.   Centralization of
administration in GOS is also evident in the management of infrastructure and bus
transportation in Karachi. Creation of the Karachi Development Authority (KDA)
has had the effect of creating a public monopoly for land development to the
detriment of the public interest in Karachi.   While the demographic and
socioeconomic character of the city has changed immensely during the past twenty
five years, institutional and legal frameworks for the management of the city
have remained unchanged. Consequently, planning and development functions in
Karachi are distributed among a number of generally autonomous bodies that report



either to the Federal Government (e.g., cantonments), Provincial Government
(e.g., KDA), or municipal government.
2.19      Karachi Development Authority.  KDA is a non-representative body which
has been the primary instrument of public infrastructure and land development in
Karachi  for nearly 35 years.   KDA was created by merger of the Karachi
Improvement Trust and the Karachi Joint Water Board with the mandate of building
and operating the Greater Bulk Water Supply System for Karachi (the first large
conveyance system for bulk water supply coming from the Indus River). KDA has
since turned over its responsibilities for bulk water supply to KWSB and expanded
its responsibilities to include overall urban planning, land management of its
public land, environmental control, transportation planning and traffic
engineering functions, construction of major bridges and road links in the city,
commercial development, and various other functions. Its main responsibility has
been the creation of serviced land to meet the ever growing need for housing in
Karachi. Since its beginning in 1957, KDA has developed and sold approximately
600,000 plots, and a much smaller number of completed houses. Although the goal
was to provide home sites for all social classes, today as many as four million
of Karachi's citizens or 40% of its total population are poorly housed and
inadequately supplied with basic services. Off-site infrastructure, particularly
for water supply and sanitation, could not be funded or developed at the rate at
which new housing sites were prepared and put up for sale by KDA. Allocation of
land was by lottery and reserved pricing. Because there was a premium on all
developed land and through much of 1970s and 1980s interest rates on bank
deposits were negative in real terms, much of KDA's allotted land fell into the
hands of speculators. According to some estimates there are as many as 250,000
vacant plots in Karachi. The issue of land pricing and management was the topic
of a recent study on urban land management financed by the International Develop-
ment Association (IDA)Y. KDA has also been the major executing agency for IDA
financed works in Karachi after the KWSB through Credits 1374-PAK and 1652-PAK.
Recently, KDA has experienced serious implementation delays in some of its on-
going contracts under Credit 1652-PAK and thus, its performance has been under
close scrutiny and monitoring by IDA over the last two years.@/ There has been
considerable improvement in its project execution performance over the past six
months.
2.20      Beginning in FY92, because of the inherent weakness of its revenue
source, KDA began experiencing serious financial difficulties and has been forced
to review its land development policies. In an effort to restore revenues and
meet a monthly wage bill of about US$1.0 million (for 8,500 employees), KDA has
prepared a corporate development plan and has begun to take action to restructure
its role and operations.  For example, KDA is now selling all land above 400
square yards at market prices through public auction.
M iaDal Instituions
2.21      Provincial governments have delegated some of their functions and
taxing authority to municipal governments by the promulgation of municipal
ordinances. Such ordinances were introduced in Punjab, Sindh, and the Northwest
7/     The study "Urban Land Management in Karachi" was prepared by a joint
venture comprising Kinhill and Associates and NESPAK, for the Karachi
Metropolitan Corporation in 1991 as part of the Karachi Special Develop-
ment Project, IDA credit 1652-PAR.

Frontier Province (NWFP) in 1979, and in Balochistan in 1980.  Ordinances of
municipal governments are generally out of date and reflect a time when the
capacities, standards and responsibilities of municipal governments were lower
and less complex than they are now.
2.22      Karachi. Responsibility for the critical functions in city management
are fragmented and reside with several government and nongovernmental bodies in
Karachi. The two major municipal bodies in Karachi responsible for provision of
the bulk of urban services are KMC and KWSB. Both entities were created under
various amendments to the Sindh Local Government Ordinance (SLGO).
2.23      Karachi Metropolitan Corporation.  KMC is the largest city government
in Pakistan and like the city of Lahore (the capital of the Province of Punjab),
has the status of a metropolitan corporation, given this status in 1976. (It was
given corporation status in 1933). KMC functions within the framework of the
SLGO of 1979.  KMC can prepare and execute its own budget, levy and collect
taxes, and sanction its personnel roster.  GOS has the authority to sanction
KMC's budget, temporarily supersede KMC's Council, issue directives, and order
an audit of its finances.
2.24      In 1987, based upon the recommendations of a National Commission of
Inquiry into civil disturbances in Karachi, GOS amended the SLGO of 1979 to SLGO
1987 and created a two-tiered federated system by creation of Zonal Municipal
Committees  (ZMCs)  in each district of Karachi.   The ZMCs were created by
delegation. Approximately 25,000 KMC employees were transferred to the ZMCs.
The mayor of KMC and the Chairpersons of ZMCs each have administrative and
executive powers delegated by the Council of KMC. Before the change to a two-
tiered system, KMC provided municipal infrastructure and services for most of
Karachi's population and over a large part of its built up area.  After the
change, responsibility for some services delivery and maintenance functions were
transferred to the ZMCs that now spend most of what was the development budget
of KMC. Each ZMC is responsible in its own area for environmental sanitation
(e.g., cleaning of streets and public latrines), construction and maintenance of
roads and streets, planning and development of parks and playgrounds, primary
education, management of dispensaries, immunization, birth and death registra-
tion, control of dangerous and offensive trades and animal control. Roads and
street lighting and parks and playgrounds are major sources of ZMCs development
activities.
2.25      KMC retains overall policy control and responsibility for public
health (control of infectious diseases), medical services, fire services, social
welfare, physical and town planning, building control, regularization of katchi
abadis, municipal police, civil defense management, and financial support to the
KWSB (bulk water supply and distribution and sewerage collection and treatment).
KMC is also beginning to acquire ownership of the housing development schemes of
KDA once these developments have been completed and functioning. Roughly twelve
schemes have been transferred to date; several more are near completion and
almost ready for transfer.
2.26      KMC is governed by an elected council, with 232 members, headed by a
mayor who is chosen by the members of the Council. Each ZMC sends one-third of
its elected members to represent their interests in the KMC Council. Directly
under the Mayor is a Municipal Commissioner, the highest ranked civil servant in
KMC, a Financial Advisor, a Director General in charge of engineering and civil
works, a Director of Octroi (responsible for collection of the octroi tax), and



- 11 -
Director Administration, all of whom are employed by the Provincial Government
of Sindh and seconded to KMC.  All department heads report to the Municipal
Commissioner. Most of the other employees belong to the Sindh Council of Unified
Grade (SCUG,) but are transferable between Local governments. KMC is organized
into 15 departments, of which 5 are administrative and 10 are line departments.
2.27      Karachi Water and Sewerage Board.  KWSB is a semi-autonomous body and
subsidiary of KMC and is responsible for providing water and sewerage infrastruc-
ture and services to the Karachi metropolitan area. IDA has been continuously
involved with KWSB since 1983 when KWSB was created and the first IDA financed
water supply operation for Karachi was begun. Prior to 1983, bulk water supply,
water treatment and distribution, and sewage collection and treatment were
handled under separate state and municipal government charters. The merging of
these functions into KWSB was a slow and complicated process.   Thus, basic
administrative systems such as record keeping, accounting, retirement plans, and
financial  reporting were  consolidated as recently as  1990.    Since  1986,
substantial progress has been made in improving KWSB's accounting and administra-
tive systems. Accounting and financial reporting systems are almost completely
computerized and are based on double-entry procedures.
2.28      During the past decade, KWSB has undertaken a very large capital works
program to bring increased water supply into Karachi (from the Indus River about
100 miles away) and to improve waste water collection and treatment facilities.
KWSB has also managed to increase its tariffs more than four fold over the past
six years. KWSB has managed over the past three years to more than cover its
operating costs (for the water and sewerage services) . Because KWSB has progres-
sively improved its internal operation, it has served as somewhat of a showcase
for the GOS with respect to other water authorities in the country. It has also
served to establish a credible technical underpinning for the institutional work
already initiated under the proposed project.
2.29      Interior Cities.  Most of the smaller secondary cities in the interior
of the Sindh Province have neither the managerial capacity nor the requisite
authority to satisfactorily perform the functional requirements of city
government. They are nominally governed by municipal committees. Because the
municipal committees have fledgling councils with little capacity, they rely
heavily on provincial staff from the Sindh Local Council Service which is a sub-
unit of the Sindh Provincial Civil Service for routine administrative and
technical tasks.  Generally, under these circumstances, municipal staff have
little incentive to improve performance. The population in intermediate cities
is 23% of the total urban population for Sindh, but their share of development
expenditures is only 1 of total provincial expenditures for development.
2.30      With the exception of Hyderabad and Sukkur, none of the interior
cities of Sindh have the legal, financial, administrative, or logistical
experience necessary to implement infrastructure projects, and Hyderabad and
Sukkur are weak in this regard. Municipal government institutions, therefore
will need considerable capacity building.

D. Overview of Sector Finance
2.31      The total size of the national public sector development expenditure
(PSDE) for FY93/94 is estimated to be Rs 136 billion.-  Of this, Rs 27 billion
or roughly 20% is allocated for financing provincial Annual Development Programs
(PADP) . The federal Annual Development Program (ADP) is allocated to each prov-
ince on the basis of population, with the largest allocation to Punjab (about a
40% share), followed by Sindh (22%), NWFP (23%) and Balochistan (15%) }'  Shares
for NWFP and Balochistan are disproportionately higher than their populations be-
cause they receive favored treatment from the Federal Government as undeveloped
areas.
Urban Investments
2.32      Total real per capita investment                 Figure 1
in the urban sector has declined over the
last six years.   Although total ADP in-
vestment fared reasonably well in nominal
terms in the 1980s, it remained stagnant               Total Provincial ADP
in real per capita terms. Figure 1J shows

approximately 10t of the federal ADP went
toward expenditures for urban physical in-
frastructure in 1990 and the same level is
expected for the years since 1990.   Of
this, about 40% is earmarked for government servants housing, government offices
and buildings, and grants to local councils (which function on behalf of rural
areas) leaving about 6% for urban physical infrastructure (including low income
housing, water supply and sewerage, environmental protection, and other urban
development) . Provincial ADP's are typically allocated in the manner described

more than the estimate of the Bank mission.

extrapolated from 1981 provincial total and urban populations, using 1972-
1981 growth rates. These populations and growth rates were reported in
Pakistan Statistical Yearbook 1991. The inflation rate used to translate
nominal expenditures into constant-rupee expenditures was the consumer
price index for Pakistan, as reported in the IMF's International Financial
Statistics for 1992.

2.36      Overview of GOS's Finances.  Table 2.4 shows the following disturbing
trends in GOS's financial position, (a) federal transfers have increased from 51S
of current revenues in 1973/77 to 82% in 1988/92; (b) interest payments have in-
creased from 10% of current expenditures in 1973/77 to 24% in 1988/92; (c)
current account deficits have increased from 8% of current revenues in 1973/77
to 23% in 1988/92; and (d) debt retirement expenses in 1988/92 were only about
half their level of 1973/77, despite ever increasing debt, as shown by increasing
interest expenses. Real development expenditures, (para 2.40), reflect a decline
in investment in real per capita terms.   If these trends continue,  future
investments in the province will not be sustainable. The combination of high
federal transfers and high interest payments has reduced the control of GOS over
its own current budget. The increasing current deficits have increased GOS's in-

debtedness and interest payments, slowed the growth of development expenditures,
and cast doubt on GOS's ability to sustain growth in the sector (Annex 10).

2.37       GOS Revenues.  As shown in Figure 4, in 1982/83 GOS's own revenues
from provincial taxes and other non-tax revenue sources accounted for 42% of
total current revenues, but in 1991/92 this share is estimated to be only 13.6%.
This declining trend in GOS's own-source revenues conflicts with the rule laid
down by the NFC award (and applied in GOS's 1991/92 and 1992/93 budgets) that
henceforth provincial governments will finance their own recurrent expenditures
and debt servicing, and that they will have to rely on using recurrent surpluses
for enlarging the size of provincial development programs.-/  In other words,
GOS can no longer look forward to having its fiscal deficits financed automati-
cally by the Federal Government.
12/   The purpose of the NFC was to make recommendations on the distribution of
financial resources between the federal and provincial governments to
ensure appropriate correspondence between expenditure needs and revenue
sources of the four provinces. For the Province of Sindh, divisible pool
transfers have increased from Rs 8.5 billion in 1989/90 to about Rs 15.0
billion in 1991/92, due to the inclusion of the surcharge on gas and
royalty on crude oil and to a special non-matching non-selective grant of
varying amounts to each of the provinces, all beginning July 1, 1991.
(For Sindh, the grant amounts to Rs 700 million per annum for five years
and then terminates.)

2.38      The NFC award will put added
pressure on GOS, because of the growth of
public debt in GOS's finances. Total out-
standing debt grew from about 6.9% of              Shares of GOS Current Revenues
gross regional product in 1981/82 to about               . .......
7.7% in 1991/92.  Real interest payments           i   ,
grew at an average annual rate of about         70%
10.0%, from about 16.9% of total current       -0 
revenues  in 1981/82  to about 22.2% of         W

current expenditure categories from 1975
to 1991.   The share of social services
(health, education, water supply, sewer-
age, solid waste collection and disposal) declined steadily in Sindh from 1975
to 1987, but then began to increase again after 1987. The shares spent on law
and order and on economic services (agriculture and food, land management, land
reclamation, irrigation, rural development and industries and minerals) have
declined more slowly but more steadily than the share of social services. The
recent increase in the share of social services has been partly at the expense
of the share of community services (other expenditures including works and public
health and subsidies), whose share increased up to 1987 but has declined since.

2.41      Although the province has been        EconoricorSeMvi E3Law and Order  MScerial s-co
able to finance increasing current expen-
ditures, it has done so at the cost of
increasing dependence on Federal transfers
and high cost debt.   Interest rates for
funds GOS borrows from the GOP for most of its ADP expenditures have been high
in real terms, reaching 5.75% above the inflation rate in 1991-92. The ADP loans
allow for modest annual expenditure on infrastructure, which is a clear need in
Sindh, but investments are plagued by implementation delays, cost overruns, f rag-
mentation across thousands of projects, and low cost recovery.   At the same
time, public investments have probably not raised the standard of service
delivery as much as they might have. Social indicators show uneven improvements

in the standard of living in Sindh. Most
of GOS's debt is incurred for capital
investment, and poor record-keeping makes
it difficult to judge whether these funds   GOS DevelopmentExpenditures per Person
are spent wisely.   It is generally felt,
however, that they are not and that there 
is significant potential for improvement.        2..
The Sindh ADP finances about 5,000 pro-          2

are ongoing and 1,500 are added every           5|

maintenance projects which have question-        6

Municipal Finances
2.42      Table 2.5 below shows the variations in financial operation at various
levels of municipal government for FY89/90, including: KMC's access to buoyant
municipal taxes, especially octroi (an import tax that is levied by municipal
governments on all imports into their jurisdictions); the interior cities' inex-
perience with borrowing and investment and hence dependence on the GOS for both
financial and technical support; and the noticeable difference in discretionary
transfers among the four interior cities, especially Larkana's dependence on
transfers as its primary source of revenue, and, relative to the other three
interior cities, its poor performance in mobilizing municipal taxes. In 1989/90,
KMC's resource mobilization was about US$10 per capita, while Larkana raised
about US$5 per inhabitant.   The above pattern of resource mobilization is
basically the same among the four provinces.
2.43      The dialogue with GOS is aimed at improving resource mobilization in
KMC and the three interior cities. GOS (in association with KMC for Karachi)
intends to expand its property tax net through improved service delivery of area
and slum upgrading by establishing a positive relationship between cost recovery
and service provision, a relationship which is not perceived to exist at the
present time. GOS generally has been receptive to the concept of decentraliza-
tion of property tax administration from GOS to municipal government, and sees
the obvious benefits in such a move.  However, GOS feels that the process of
decentralization should be a gradual one based on further strengthening of local
capacity, and thus considers decentralization as an ultimate goal of the proposed
project, when municipal governments have the capability of taking on this
responsibility.

The city of Karachi does not pay the full cost of its infrastructure or services,

gradually reduce its dependence
on this revenue source.
2.47      Property taxes accounted for an estimated 7.21 of KMC's current
revenues in FY92 but potentially could be a major source of revenue. A recent
study has indicated that, with a combination of revaluation, removal of
exemptions, reassessments, increased coverage, and improved billing and collec-
tions, current yields potentially could be increased tenfold over- a period of
four years, i.e., from about Rs 200 million in 1991/92 to Rs 2.0 billion in
1995/96. Although the property tax is collected for KMC by the GOS, there is
little incentive for GOS to improve the yield of this tax. Because it would be
in the interest of municipal governments to improve administration of property
tax, incentives to do so could be strengthened if full administration of the tax
were devolved to municipal governments, starting with KMC, which is the most
advanced of the municipal councils in the province. Because the property tax is
potentially a major source of revenue, assurances were obtained at necotiations
that GOS will revalue all properties in Karachi and uDdate its Droiertv list to
the satisfaction of IDA (para 6.1(a)).

basic urban infrastructure, but
also for functions which KMC must finance from recurrent revenues (e.g., solid
waste management, primary education, preventive health, road maintenance, and
maintenance of storm water drainage infrastructure) . Operation of public sector
enterprises, such as the slaughter house (abattoir), have a small but negative
impact on KMC's budgetary priorities through subsidization.
2.51      The quality of financial information from KMC is weak for a number of
reasons: accounting procedures are based on single entry cash accounting and are
structured in accordance with a chart of accounts, which itself is inadequate to
reveal performance information; capital and recurrent expenditures are
inadequately separated and there is only a rudimentary attempt at service
costing; financial control over money owed is weak; the concept of budgetary
control exists only in so far as comparisons are made between detailed budgets
and actual spending; budgets are not used as planning documents; land records are
not properly maintained and hinder collection of land lease charges; and there
seems to be little relationship between income raising decisions and the proposed
levels of expenditure.  KMC has taken action to address some of these issues
under the Karachi Special Development Project, Credit 1652-PAK, through updating
its financial records, introduction of double entry accounting and financial
reporting systems, and computerization. After a slow start, progress has been
satisfactory and the updating of KMC's records is underway.  Introduction of
double entry accounting and financial reporting and computerization systems is
expected to take two to three years to complete.
2.52      Proper accountability in financial planning and management can be im-
proved by strengthening municipal government personnel and institutions through
long-term training and technical assistance programs, improving the accounting
and financial reporting procedures, introducing a chart of accounts which focuses
on improved service costing, providing an analysis of expenditure between capital
and revenue, properly identifying assets and liabilities, and introducing basic
accounting routines which analyze income and expenditures and prepare management
reports for higher level managers and staff. Under the proposed project, KMC
will implement a program to strengthen its financial operation (See Annex 4 for
outline terms of reference.)
2.53      Interior Cities.  The financial condition of the three interior cities
that will participate initially in the program is reasonably satisfactory, and
they have shown the ability to hold their expenditures within available revenues.
Two of these cities recorded a small surplus in their current account. Octroi
is their principal revenue source.   Larkana recorded a small deficit of Rs
107,000 on total revenues of about Rs 16 million, or a deficit to total income
ratio of less than one percent. Capital expenditures for the three cities have
been financed either from their small current account surpluses or from grants
from GOS.   None of the cities have utilized debt financing for capital
development projects.



- 20 -
2.54      Significant  revenue-raising potential  exists.   User  charges  and
property taxes could expand significantly the financial capacity of municipal
governments without adversely affecting the budgetary positions of the federal
and provincial governments. Development expenditures (mostly for rehabilitation
works) make up only a small portion of municipal budgets, with larger municipal
committees (population >100,000) devoting 16t to development and smaller ones
only 6%. Most of the municipal finances go toward salaries. The three cities
in the proposed project have concentrated their development activity primarily
in three sectors: transport improvements; water supply and drainage; and solid
waste management, collectively accounting for about 90% of their development
expenditures.
E. GOS Policy Initiatives
2.55      Despite  rapid  economic  growth,  Pakistan has  faced  two  related
problems. First, it has failed to mobilize sufficient resources to finance its
rapidly growing development needs and to keep its fiscal and balance of payments
deficits within acceptable ranges. Second, Pakistan lacks infrastructural and
institutional support for urban growth. By the turn of the century, almost half
of all workers are projected to be employed in urban areas.   Employing and
housing this labor force will require enormous additions to urban infrastructure
and services and strain the already weakened urban institutions.
2.56      These two central problems account for the five most  important
constraints to urban productivity in Pakistan: underinvestment in infrastructure;
poor resource mobilization; ineffective markets for land, finance, shelter and
information; absence of an environmental regulatory regime; and poor public
sector management, especially as it applies to provincial and municipal
government activities in the urban sector. The proposed project will begin to
address these constraints, with a mixture of needed infrastructure investment and
policy and regulatory reform.
2.57      Because of policy dialogue with IDA during preparation of the proposed
project, GOS has made significant progress toward dealing with some of the root
causes of these problems and constraints, and has prepared a Statement of
Policies on Fiscal and Administrative Reform (Annex 1) . The Statement sets out
the broad direction of reform in the following areas: (a) fiscal and financial;
(b)  administrative;  (c)  land management;  (d)  urban  transport;  (e)  urban
environment; (f) water services; and (g) local government. Because the policy
statement covers a substantial area of public policy and governance in Sindh, the
proposed project plans to support implementation of the first five years of the
policy reform program (PRP) . Confirmation of the Statement of Policies on Fiscal
and Administrative Reform has been obtained from GO.
2.58      GOS has prepared a series of action programs that set out the concrete
steps that need to be taken to implement its policy agenda. The action programs
cover the following areas:
(a)  Revalue all properties located in Karachi, update property tax list,
reduce exemptions, and improve collection performance.
(b)  Terminate low-return or poor performing infrastructure projects in the
current portfolio, including projects which have been approved by P&D.
(c)  Amend procedures to shift to three-year investment planning, program-
ming, and budgeting in GOS as part of the investment planning and
budgeting sub-component to overhaul the way public investments are
identified, appraised, budgeted, monitored and supervised.



- 21 -
(d)  Prepare a policy paper on environmental regulations for Sindh.  At the
present time, there is no overall policy framework for urban environ-
ment in Sindh.  This policy white paper would begin the  process of
developing such a framework.
(e)  Amend the Sindh Local Government Ordinance (para 2.22) to modernize
it. This measure aims at improving efficiency of provincial govern-
ment relations with municipal and district governments.
(f)  Amend the Sindh Disposal of Plots Ordinance governing disposal of
public lands in Karachi to allow market pricing for all plots above
120 square yards.   KDA now holds public auctions for all plots
exceeding 400 square yards. Amendment of this legislation is part of
a broader corporate development plan to: (a) restructure and stream-
line KDA requiring termination of its monopolistic hold on land
development in Karachi (public as well as private); and (b) enable the
private sector more active involvement in land development for the
middle and upper income in Karachi, leaving KDA to concentrate on the
low-income.
(g)  Establish a training center for municipal government in Karachi that
would serve the needs of the entire province.
(h)  Establish a permanent policy formulation and project supervision
capability within the GOS (para 2.61).
2.59      GOS's FY94 budget, which now has been officially gazetted, represents
an important turning point in GOS' budget policy. For the first time in several
years, GOS presented a realistic budget depicting its true financial condition
to the Provincial Assembly, and was able to pass a modest finance bill containing
a number of the fiscal and administrative policy measures from the Statement of
Policies, including measures to increase local tax and non-tax revenues.  In
addition, the Sindh Cabinet voted to take some important steps toward containing
the growth of recurrent expenditures, and down-sizing its portfolio of
investments. Most prominent among the immediate revenue measures are:
(a)  increased property taxes via a surcharge for all residential and
commercial properties by 30% for properties assessed between 1968 and
1979, 15% for properties assessed between 1980 and 1992, and 30% for
all industrial properties; and
(b)  increased motor vehicle taxes by 10% for all vehicles  starting
with the fiscal year, July 1, 1993.
2.60      Because of its desire to keep its budget under control, GOS has
requested assistance through the proposed project in monitoring of its FY94
budget performance. GOS brought to negotiations the action plans (para 2.59) and
a budget monitoring plan for discussion.Ls-  Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that IDA and GOS would annually review Drogress in implementing the
action Programs and in reducing and eliminating the budget deficit to the
satisfaction of IDA (para 6.1(b) and 3.8 (c)).
15/   The plan included such monitoring indicators as original budget estimates
against revised estimates of recurrent account deficits, overdraft debits
with the State Bank of Pakistan, recurrent and development expenditures,
revenue collections, and down-sizing of the existing development portfo-
lio.



- 22 -
2.61      Little attention has been given to policy formulation in GOS in the
past, and for the most part what has been accomplished has been on an informal
and ad-hoc basis.   To provide a more systematic and effective process, and
because policy reform and institutional strengthening require inputs from both
the political and administrative branches of government, a separate institutional
arrangement consisting of two high level policy committees (The Sindh Cabinet
Committee and the Secretaries Sub-Committee) has been established by GOS (see
para 3.18). A coordinating unit, the Executive Policy Action and Coordination
Organization (EXPACO), has been formed for policy formulation, and the Director
General EXPACO has been appointed. Within EXPACO, GOS will have a unit
responsible for managing the policy analysis process, the Policy Analysis
Coordination Unit (PACU), and two other units, the Project Planning Unit (PPU)
and an Institutional Strengthening Coordination Unit (ISCU). The PPU will be
responsible for administrative support, supervision, and monitoring of the
project, particularly the physical investments. The ISCU will be responsible for
coordinating institutional strengthening activities of the project. One objective
of the project will be to institutionalize these activities, so that by the end
of the project they will be an integral part of the normal functioning of
government (See Figure 7.)

AD-HOC Workina Groups
The Sindh Cabinet Committee comprises all of the concerned ministers and is
chaired by the Chief Minister. The Secretary's Sub-Committee comprises all of
the concerned secretaries and is chaired by the Chief Secretary of GOS. A third
level of this arrangement comprises Ad-Hoc Working Groups whose members do the
needed technical-analytical work on each proposed policy measure undertaken by
the project.   The  Ad-Hoc Working Groups consist of the higher level staffs
(additional and deputy secretaries, and section chiefs) from each of the



- 23 -
concerned line and administrative departments of GOS. The Working Groups, the
Secretaries Sub-Committee and the Cabinet Committee are responsible for determin-
ing the technical, administrative (regulatory), and political feasibility of each
policy recommendation,  respectively  (para 3.18).   GOS has also decided to
establish the PPU, an autonomous and parallel unit with EXPACO created for the
purpose of overall administrative support, coordination, and monitoring of budget
performance, and for strengthening investment planning and budgeting procedures
in P&D and Finance. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that GOS would
maintain a coordinating mechanism for policy formulation and proiect monitoring
acceptable to IDA (para 6.1(c)).
F. Previous IDA Involvement in the Urban Sector
2.62      Review of Urban Prolects in Karachi.  Three credits have been made in
Karachi, two for water supply and sewerage and one for urban development. The
Karachi Water Supply Project (Credit 1374-PAK, US$25 million, 1983) which became
effective in 1983, was successfully completed in October 1991 and a Project
Completion Report has been prepared and assessed by OED. Their assessment was
"satisfactory"  for  overall  performance,  "likely"  for  sustainability,  and
"substantial" for institutional development; in general, an overall positive
assessment. While the Second Karachi Water Supply and Sanitation Project (Credit
1987-PAK, US$125 million, 1989) has made significant strides in institutional
strengthening, especially in its finance and project execution wings, it
encountered serious problems with start-up delays and, especially, cost overruns.
A supplemental credit of US$91.9 million to help cover the financing gap was
approved by the Board on February 9, 1993.
2.63      The  second  on-going  IDA-financed  project,  the  Karachi  Special
Development Project (Credit 1652-PAK, US$70 million, 1986) (para 2.19), covers
a broader range of urban infrastructure. The main objective of this project is
to strengthen the institutional and financial capacity of municipal agencies in
Karachi in project execution, delivery of urban services, and recovery of costs.
Start-up problems and delays lasting almost 12 months were due to initial
institutional inertia. However, the project has slowly moved forward. Although
all contracts for civil works and technical assistance have been signed and are
under implementation, delays plagued the execution of some of the contracts
executed by KDA (mostly some of the smaller contracts such as rehabilitation of
outfall drains), but steps have been taken to remedy the situation. The June
1993 supervision mission looked specifically into this aspect and concluded that
KDA had indeed made progress in improving project implementation and disburse-
ments.  With the exception of technical assistance to KTC and implementation
delays experienced under some of the KDA projects, the performance of the
executing agencies in general has steadily improved and progress has been made
in developing their capacities in project execution.   Implementation of the
components to line the KG Canal and to construct syphons 19 and 20 by KWSB has
introduced new technologies for the water sector in Pakistan. For KG Canal a
mechanical concrete lining technology was used, and for the syphons, mechanically
formed steel was used, instead of concrete. Implementation of the slum upgrading
component by KMC, particularly with regard to regularization and cost recovery,
has only recently improved after a period of uneven performance due to poor
organization and weak management.
2.64      An important lesson from the three projects above is that effective
and sustainable institutional strengthening requires long-term managerial and
technical assistance, and training resources.



- 24 -
G. Rationale for IDA Involvement
2.65      These three earlier operations (para 2.62 and 2.63) have strengthened
the financial and managerial performance of the KWSB but had little impact on
urban policies and other institutions in the city. Indeed, this experience is
not unique to IDA's urban lending in Karachi (or Pakistan in general) . The World
Bank's policy paper on urbanization ("Urban Policy and Economic Development--An
Agenda for the 1990s")  published in 1991 concluded that:   "... [Past urban
projects supported by donors] have not had major impact on policies of national
and local governments and the broader issues of managing the urban economy. In
only a few cases... have citywide impacts been achieved. Most important, because
many urban programs did not achieve sustainable policy reform and institutional
development they were not replicable." The Bank's policy paper set out three
broad objectives for assistance in the urban sector: (a) improve the productivity
of the urban areas; (b) alleviate urban poverty; and (c) address the growing
urban environmental crisis.
2.66      Against this background, the policy paper anticipated an increase in
the Bank's urban activities and suggested this will be:  "... accompanied by an
intensified effort to improve the impact of lending by explicitly reorienting its
emphasis through policy and institutional development in most countries."
However, in Pakistan--as in most other developing countries--the agenda for
policy and institutional reforms is long and complex, and can only be implemented
gradually over time. Thus, IDA (as well as other donors) has to take a long-term
view and essentially enter into a partnership with the governments concerned.
According to the Pakistan Constitution, urban development is primarily a
provincial subject; thus the provincial and local governments have to be the main
interlocutors for IDA lending. Through its three previous operations and through
the preparation of the proposed project, IDA has established not only a track
record in the institutional strengthening of KWSB but also a constructive policy
dialogue with GOS and the key agencies in Karachi.  Thus, IDA is in a unique
position--as compared with other bilateral and multilateral donors--to respond
to GOS's request for support of the initial phase of its policy and institutional
reform program (para 2.58).
2.67      IDA  Country  Assistance  and  Sector  Assistance  Strategies.    IDA
assistance strategy for Pakistan supports the Government's main medium-term
economic goals, namely to promote economic growth, reduce financial imbalances,
alleviate poverty, and improve social sector performance. More specifically, the
assistance strategy concentrates on four priority development areas: strengthen-
ing social sector performance; improving the enabling environment for the private
sector; developing stronger management of Pakistan's natural resources and the
environment; and improving public expenditure performance as a key part of
strengthening macro-economic performance and carrying out the structural
adjustment program.
2.68      The strategy for the infrastructure sector has three main elements
which support  the country assistance  strategy:  (a)  help  ensure  that  the
infrastructure demands of an expanding economy and rapidly growing population can
be met in a cost-efficient manner; (b) counter the environmental and health
threats associated with rapid industrialization and uncontrolled urbanization
through pollution control and liquid and solid waste management; and (c) expand
the role of the private sector in the provision of basic infrastructure.

ml. THE PROJECT
A. Qrigji
3.1       Implementation of the IDA financed projects and the on-going dialogue
with IDA convinced GOS that increased attention had to be paid to the underlying
cause of urban problems in the province. This belief led GOS to begin preparing
the Sindh Special Development Project (SSDP) in 1990 by (a) developing a program
of policy and regulatory reform that is aimed at the fiscal and administrative
policies and practices affecting the urban sector; (b) identifying some of the
urgent environmental and transport problems in Karachi and selected interior
cities in order to enhance the productivity of enterprises and provide better
access to jobs and services; and (c) beginning the process of developing a more
effective investment program.  Project preparation was financed partly under the
UNDP/UNCHS Sindh Intermediate Cites Project and through a grant from the Japanese
Policy and Human Resources Development Fund.
B. Project Objectives
3.2       In the spirit of the Bank's policy paper on urban development (paras
2.65 to 2.67) the proposed project will support policy reform at the provincial
and municipal level and the strengthening of key urban institutions as well as
increasing urban productivity through transport improvements and tackling the
environmental deterioration associated with rapid industrialization and
urbanization. However, the environmental and infrastructure problems in Karachi
and the other cities in Sindh are immense and will require sustained investments
over a period  of many years  totalling hundreds of millions  of dollars.
Similarly, all the needed fiscal, administrative and policy reforms can only be
achieved over a prolonged period. Thus, the proposed project is modest in its
objectives, which are to support the first five years of the Policy Reform
Program by: (a) financing an immediate action plan to begin to deal with some of
the most urgent environmental and infrastructure problems in Karachi and three
interior cities; (b) supporting GOS's newly created policy-making arrangement and
helping to implement its program of fiscal and administrative reforms;   (c)
initiating institutional strengthening for two key organizations in Karachi,
namely KDA and KMC, and for three interior cities; and (d) preparing engineering
studies for future transport and infrastructure improvements in Karachi.
C. Main Features of the Project
3.3       The five components of the proposed project are:-6/ (a) environmental
upgrading investments in Karachi; (b) transport improvements in Karachi and three
interior  cities;  (c)  fiscal  and administrative  reform;  (d)  institutional
strengthening, and (e) investment program preparation.
3.4       The physical interventions under the proposed project will focus on
Karachi as it is not only the country's largest city and commercial and
industrial center, but also the city where the urban problems are most serious.
At the same time, it is essential to improve the productivity of and the growth
prospects for secondary towns.  Thus, selected transport investments in three
interior cities have been included.   Karachi has a tradition of community
involvement in the upgrading of informal settlements, such as the Orangi area
with almost two million people. The central and provincial governments are about
16/ Detailed description of these components and terms of reference for
the technical assistance are summarized in Annexes 4 and 7.



- 26 -
to launch a Social Action Program with extensive support by IDA and other donors.
This program will expand the availability of basic social infrastructure in
disadvantaged areas.  Thus, in order to limit the size and complexity of the
proposed project, it will exclude any traditional upgrading of low income
communities and concentrate on environmental improvement works that require
government action and have broader impact and on works that enhance urban
productivity.   Similarly,  it has been deemed more appropriate to support
investments in water supply and sanitation and further institutional strengthen-
ing of KWSB through separate operations.   The main focus of the technical
assistance components is on policy and administrative reforms aimed at enhancing
resource mobilization and strengthening investment planning and financial
management, which are priority areas in the Pakistani context. The institutional
building component focuses on the main implementing agency, KDA, and begins a
process of strengthening the weak municipal administration for Karachi (KMC) to
prepare it for an expanded role in the future.
Environmental Upgradin2 Investments
3.5       Low lying areas in Karachi are subject to frequent and widespread
flooding during monsoon. The environmental upgrading investments included in the
proposed project are part of a larger program of macro drainage and flood
protection for the city as a whole. They have been selected because they will
yield immediate benefits and because they do not involve any significant
resettlement. The proposed credit would finance both civil works and technical
assistance for project management and construction supervision.   The two
upgrading components are:
(a)  Storm Water Drainage--channelization of outfall reaches of the Korangi
nallah, which is one of two primary drains serving the Korangi
area. -
(b)  Malir River Flood Protection Works--(i) construction of the final
phase-'/ (about six miles long) of earthen bund network protecting
the Korangi area from seasonal flood damage; (ii) construction of
eleven spurs along both embankments, and four causeways crossing the
embankments and linking with existing roads; (iii) channelization of
Pir Bukhari nallah; (iv) construction of additional slope protection
works along the new bund; and (v) resettlement of six small agricul-
tural farms and one poultry farm presently located along the alignment
of the proposed bund construction.
3.6       Although the above two environmental upgrading investments would
provide immediate benefits to the Korangi Industrial Area and Malir River Estuary
(a major industrial and commercial, but highly polluted area in Karachi), an
environmental impact assessment (EIA) of this entire area has become a necessity
because (a) future cleaning up of the toxic effluents that drain into city sewers
and storm water drains should not be attempted without better understanding of
the environmental implications; and (b) preparation of a proposed Karachi Hydro-
cracker Project (FY94L) will require that an environmental assessment be made of
its impact on the same vicinity under the proposed project.
17/ Korangi is a mixed low-income residential and industrial area of Karachi
with a population of about two million people.
18/   Phase IV is financed under Cr. 1652-PAK.

Transport Improvements
3.7       Karachi and some of the more prosperous cities in the interior are
experiencing rapidly growing vehicle flows (10t per year) and worsening traffic
congestion. As in many densely populated Asian cities, they are suffering from
limited road space and narrow rights of way, encroachments, haphazard on-street
parking, loading/unloading of goods, lack of pedestrian facilities and bad road
safety conditions. The proposed project would finance civil works and technical
assistance for construction supervision. The transport improvements focus on
remaining key traffic bottlenecks, while minimizing the need to relocate
households and small businesses. The components are:
(a) Two Bridges along major traversals linking the major northern bound
arteries: (i) widening and improvement of existing bridge on Rashid
Minhas road over Lyari River to add four lanes, including resettlement
of 10 temporary habitations and 51 small businesses in the project
area, about half of which are one-man operations functioning in open
hutments; and (ii) construction of a railway overpass on University
road near junction with Rashid Minhas road, including resettlement of
25 small businesses situated along the alignments.
(b) Traffic Manaaement along 16 intersections (3 signalized, 8 rotary, and
5 uncontrolled), including works for removal of roundabouts, installa-
tion of signals, provision of channelizing islands with proper
markings and signs, adequate facilities for pedestrians and other site
specific improvements.
(c) Road and Transport Infrastructure ImDrovements in Interior Cities
(Larkana, Nawabshah and Mirpurkhas) which are relatively dynamic and
experience serious congestion, includes works for relocation and
renovation of truck (Nawabshah) and bus terminals (one each in Larkana
and Mirpurkhas), and other road and transport improvements.
Fiscal and Administrative Reforn
3.8       The proposed project would provide the analytical and managerial
support for GOS's new high level policy group--EXPACO--and help implement the
first phase of GOS's overall policy reform program set forth in the Policy
Statement (Annex 1) and the Policy Matrix (Annex 2).  This component of the
project consists of three sub-components, and includes technical assistance and
training for policy development, capacity building, project support, vehicles,
and computer and office equipment. The main sub-components are:
(a) Property Tax Reform. This sub-component takes the first step toward
fiscal and administrative reform, initially in Karachi and then in the
interior cities, with a focus on: expansion of the property tax net;
improvement in property tax administration; rationalization of fees
and taxes associated with the transfer of real property; selling of
land at market prices; and the establishment of institutional arrange-
ments to monitor tax policies for economic and financial impacts on
households and firms in Sindh. The Excise and Taxation Department of
GOS will work with municipal bodies on this task except for revision
of land-use and building regulations, which is predominantly the
responsibility of KDA, and on market pricing of land, which will be
the responsibility of the Board of Revenue and KDA.



- 28 -
(b)  Investment  Planning  and Budgeting.    This  subcomponent  involves
GOS in activities throughout Sindh, both at the provincial and local
government levels, with focus on: evaluation of existing projects and
termination of low-priority investments; review and preparation of a
report on the size and composition of the current year's development
portfolio (all sectors) no later than January 31 of each year,
starting 1994, for consideration by the Sindh Cabinet Committee;
improvements in project identification and appraisal procedures and
practices; changes in budgetary and planning procedures to include
three-year investment planning and budgeting; and improvements in
project supervision and monitoring procedures.   The Planning and
Development Department in association with the Finance Department will
be responsible for carrying out these activities. To support similar
improvements at the municipal government level, the GOS will establish
the basis for mutual planning and programming for financial and
technical assistance, and provide management and technical assistance
and training to municipal governments through involvement of the Local
Government and Rural Development Department.
(c) Financial Management. Financial management will include working with
the Finance Department in identification and implementation of
strategies for reduction and elimination of GOS's current account
deficit; reduction of subsidies (food/wheat, municipal bodies,
Hyderabad Development Authority and commercial corporations); stopping
unfunded external budget sanctions; rationalization of GOS's cost of
borrowing; containment of recurrent expenditure growth; strengthening
public auditing procedures; separation of the development and non-
development accounts; establish proper monitoring of Finance Depart-
ment to ensure ADP remains within GOS's financial means; computeriza-
tion of financial accounting, monitoring, and reporting systems and
procedures; standardization of provincial and municipal government
accounting practices; establishment of financial forecasting proce-
dures and strengthening of financial administration.   The Finance
Department in association with the Planning and Development Department
will be responsible for carrying out the above activities.
Institutional Strengthenin
3.9       This component consists of consultancies to strengthen two important
urban executing agencies in Karachi:
(a)  Karachi Development Authority.   This sub-component will focus on
institutional strengthening of KDA, with a view to assisting it in:
implementing a policy of market-pricing of land; reforming and
implementing the non-utilization fee policy for vacant land; imple-
menting a policy of in-filling in Karachi and a strategy for better
utilization of surplus government lands; modernizing land record
systems and procedures; computerizing records management operations
and train senior and middle level staff; implementing resettlement
projects under guidelines acceptable to IDA; and development of a base
map for Karachi which would have immediate benefits for various public
agencies in Karachi;
(b)  Karachi Metropolitan Corporation.   The sub-component will focus on
assisting KMC in developing and implementing a corporate development
plan, including the strengthening of its organizational capacity to
undertake improved financial planning and management, modernized land
record systems and procedures, computerized records management
operations, resettlement activities, training of senior and middle



- 29 -
level staff, and improved operations and expanded services, together
with the development of a municipal training institute for municipal
governments in conjunction with the Local Government and Rural
Development Department.
Investment Progrgm Preparation
3.10      This component includes consultancies for preparation of GOS's (core)
investment program, including:
urban transport, focusing on preparation of: final designs and
procurement documentation to complete the engineering design work for
the first corridor of the proposed bus transitway'9 , and an environ-
mental impact assessment and preparation of resettlement plans for the
second corridor.   (Preliminary engineering studies for *the second
corridor have been concluded under French bilateral assistance). In
addition, urban transport studies would be initiated in Karachi on:
traffic demand management (including the establishment of an Urban
Transport Policy Advisory Group); traffic engineering training;
traffic police training; and options for privatizing the publicly held
bus transport corporation, the Karachi Transport Corporation (KTC).
3.11      In parallel with the environmental upgrading component,  the Swiss
Development Cooperation (SDC) is expected to make available financing (about
US$1.0 million) for carrying out project preparation pilot studies on application
of best practices in incremental housing, home improvement and income-generation
lending in low-income communities in Karachi and a few selected interior towns.
These best practices would build upon the successful experiences of other
projects in Pakistan such as the "Khuda ki Basti" project in Hyderabad, 20/  the
Orangi Pilot Project in Karachi, and the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh.
D. Proiect Cost
3.12      The project cost is estimated at Rs 1622.6 million (US$58.6 million
equivalent), and includes US$4.0 million for physical contingencies, US$6.5 mil-
lion for price contingencies, and US$3.7 million for duties and taxes. The total
baseline cost estimate is US$48.1 million equivalent at December 1993 prices.
The total foreign exchange component is US$23.4 million, or 40% of the total
cost. GOS/KMC are expected to finance 20.1% of total project costs, and IDA
79.9%. The project costs are summarized in Table 3.1 and presented in detail in
Annex 5.
3.13      The estimates are based on recent price experience with on-going
projects in Karachi (Credit 1652-PAK and 1987-PAK) . For civil works 15% has been
allowed for physical contingencies, and for equipment and goods 5%.  The annual
inflation rates assumed in estimating the price contingencies for local and
foreign currency expenditures are shown below.  The local inflation for FY94 is
based on the most recent IMF estimate, incorporating the impact of the 1992
floods.
19/   The environmental impact assessment and resettlement plans were started
under Credit 1652-PAK for the first corridor which is expected to be
financed in the proposed Karachi Urban Transport Project (FY97L).

studies is 1,623 (local 1,435 and foreign 188) at US$4,000 per staff-month
equivalent for local consultants and US$22,000 per staff-month equivalent for
internationally recruited consultants. Of the total staff-months, 30% (487 sm)
is for project support (procurement and legal assistance); 50.6% (821 sm) for
capacity building (development of municipal training institute, organization and
systems development, and staff and manpower training); and 19.4% (315 sm) for
policy development (policy studies, formulation and implementation). Refer to
Annex 6 for detailed breakdown of technical assistance.

E. Financing Plan and Flow of Funds
3.15     A summary of the financing plan is shown in the Credit and Project
Summary (page ii).  Net of interest financing, the proposed IDA financing of
US$46.8 million will finance 79.9* of the total estimated project costs, or 85.2%
of the total net of duties and taxes.  The IDA credit will cover 100l  of
estimated foreign exchange costs (US$23.4 million) plus 66% (US$23.4 million) of
the estimated local currency costs.  GOS and KMC will finance 20.1% of total
project costs, or US$11.8 million.  GOS will finance 20.0t of total costs or
US$11.7 million. KMC will finance 0.1% or US$0.1 million. (Annex 11).
3.16     Flow of Funds. GOP will pass the proceeds of the credit to GOS on
standard IDA terms.  GOS will then pass the credit funds to the respective
executive agencies on the same terms and conditions as it has received from GOP.
Of the total funds available, GOS will be allocated about 38.7% (US$18.1
million), KDA about 54.7% (US$25.6 million), and KMC about 6.6% (US$3.1 million)
F. ImRlementation of the Proiect
3.17     There are two parts to project implementation: implementation of the
physical investments, and implementation of the policy and institutional reform
program. Overall administrative support, coordination and monitoring for project
implementation will be the responsibility of the PPU (para 3.19). Institutional
responsibilities for project implementation are shown below (para 2.15).

3.18      Policy Formulation.  To coordinate formulation and implementation of
policy and institutional reform within the project, GOS has established the
Executive Policy Action and Coordination Organization (EXPACO), an autonomous
unit created to coordinate policy reform and oversee implementation of SSDP (para
2.61). The policy formulation process involves two key committees--the Sindh
Cabinet Committee, chaired by the Chief Minister, and the Secretaries Sub-
Committee, chaired by the Chief Secretary--and Ad-Hoc Working Groups formed as
needed to carry out the technical/analytical work of developing proposed policy
measures. The Director General of EXPACO will report directly to the Chief
Secretary and will serve as secretary to the SSDP Cabinet Committee and have the
responsibility of overseeing the activities of the Secretaries Sub-Committee, Ad-
Hoc Working Groups, and any private/public policy advisory committees (i.e., for
procurement, municipal development, urban transport, land management, resettle-
ment, etc.) (see Figure 7). The Ad-Hoc Working Groups consist of higher level
staff (additional and deputy secretaries and section chiefs) from each of the
line and administrative departments of GOS concerned with the particular issue
being addressed. The Working Groups, Secretaries Sub-Committee, and Sindh Cabinet
Committee are respectively responsible for determining the technical, administra-
tive (regulatory), and political feasibility of each policy recommendation. It
is intended that this process of policy analysis and development be institution-
alized within GOS by the end of the project. The DG EXPACO will be responsible
for facilitation of communication among departments of GOS, between the
Secretaries Sub-Committee and the Sindh Cabinet Committee, and between GOS and
IDA on policy formulation and implementation and for overseeing the activities
of the Policy Formulation Coordination Unit, the PPU, and the ISCU. EXPACO will
be staffed by senior government officers, retired government officials, and
senior private sector individuals to take advantage of the pool of experience and
knowledge outside government. Key staff of EXPACO and its subordinate units have
been appointed. All apRointments of key officers and consultants will reauire
prior review by IDA.
3.19      Proiect Supervision and Monitorinq.  The Project Planning Unit (PPU)
within EXPACO will be responsible for overall administrative support, coordina-
tion, and monitoring of project implementation. The PPU will work with senior
officials in the concerned GOS departments and agencies and participating
interior cities to ensure timely and effective implementation of the project, in
particular the physical investments and planning and preparation for future
projects. This will involve establishing of plans and targets; monitoring of
physical and financial performance, procurement and disbursement; managing the
Special Account for GOS activities; and preparation and consolidation of
quarterly reports to GOS and IDA on project performance. Because of the limited
capacity of the interior cities to supervise and execute their projects, the PPU
will provide support to Local Government and to the municipalities to ensure
timely and effective implementation of works and planning and preparation of new
works. An important objective of this unit is to institutionalize the project
appraisal and supervision skills acquired during implementation of the project,
through guidance and monitoring of these activities by PPU and technical
assistance and training provided by ISCU. The PPU will provide administrative
support for EXPACO, including contracting with consultants as needed, and will
coordinate closely with the PACU and ISCU. Technical assistance and advisory
support will be provided to the PPU to ensure that it can carry out its
responsibilities effectively.
3.20      Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening. The Institutional
Strengthening Coordination Unit (ISCU) will be responsible for coordinating and
supporting institutional strengthening and capacity building within GOS, KDA,
XMC, and the three participating interior cities. Within GOS, the focus will be



- 33 -
on strengthening of Excise and Taxation in property tax administration and
valuation; of the Planning and Development Department and Finance Department in
investment planning and budgeting, project appraisal, and project monitoring; and
of the Finance Department in financial management, administration, and
forecasting, and to computerize financial accounting, monitoring, and reporting
systems and procedures (see para 3.8 and 3.9). The interior cities will require
technical assistance and training in project planning, programming, budgeting,
and management, as well as in financial accounting and management, operations and
maintenance. A management training center will be established in coordination
with the Local Government and Rural Development Department and KMC, to serve KMC
and the interior cities.
G. Implementation Schedule
3.21      Price contingencies and financial and economic analysis are based on
a five year implementation period. The implementation schedule (for design/bid
evaluation, technical assistance/training, and civil works) for the various
components of the project is shown in Annex 8. The description of the components
is shown in Annexes 4 and 7. The planned project completion date is June 30,
1998.
H. Final Designs and PrepLaration of Bidding Documents
3.22      Outline terms of reference for technical assistance for the institu-
tional strengthening investments have been completed (Annex 4).
3.23      PC-ls for all of the physical investments have been prepared and
cleared with the GOS. PC-1 approvals from the GOP are expected to be obtained
by Board Presentation and along with ratification of the Project Agreement by
GOS, KDA and KMC, are conditions of effectiveness (para 6.2(a) and (b)). The two
works which are scheduled to commence construction during the first year of
project implementation have completed final engineering and procurement
documentation.  These works are channelization of the Korangi nallah and the
traffic management schemes, both in Karachi.   Works for the two bridges in
Karachi which are scheduled to start the early part of the second year of project
implementation have completed engineering and procurement documentation on the
basis of design-build specifications. Works for the Malir River Flood Protection
scheme have completed final engineering and procurement documentation for most
of  the  sub-component.    The  remaining  portion  has  completed  engineering
specifications and procurement documentation on the basis of design-build. These
five investments constitute about 85% of total physical works under the project.
The remaining 15% constitutes the physical works in the three interior cities.
Preliminary feasibility studies and conceptual engineering sketches for the truck
stand,  bus terminals,  and road improvements have been completed.   Further
engineering work is continuing and is expected to be completed by March 31, 1994.
3.24      Execution of Works.  Given the cost overruns that have occurred in
several donor-assisted projects in Pakistan recently, the development wing in KDA
will be strengthened by the creation of a special construction supervision unit
for supervision of all civil works undertaken by the project. The unit would be
comprised of a joint venture between a qualified international consultancy and
a local municipal engineering firm.  The strengthening of this unit will be
consistent with the program for institutional strengthening of KDA.

I. Land Acuiisition and Resettlement
3.25      Land Accuisition.  Total land acquisition and minor resettlement cost
is estimated at about Rs 23.9 million (US$0.86 million equivalent). Of this, Rs
9.1 million is for land acquisition and preparation, which includes: (a) about
Rs 3.1 million for land acquisition for construction of the railway overpass on
University road and widening of the bridge on Rashid Minhas Road; and (b) about
Rs 6.0 million for land acquisition for the bus and truck terminals in the
interior cities. The relocation site of the truck terminal in Nawabshah is about
eight acres and is located on the eastern side of the city and expected to cost
about Rs 560,000. The relocation site of the Mirpurkhas bus terminal is about
six acres located on the north-east side of the city and expected to cost Rs 2.5
million. The Larkana bus terminal site is about eleven acres on the northern
edge of the town and expected to cost about Rs 2.9 million. None of the selected
sites involve resettlement. GOS's action Plan for land acauisition discussed
during necotiations was found to be satisfactory to IDA.
3.26      Resettlement.   There is only limited resettlement in the proposed
project. Support of all of the major components identified by GOS for inclusion
in the project has been deferred which contained large amounts of resettlement
and were not sufficiently prepared. In Karachi, minor resettlement is involved
in three sub-components: Malir River flood protection, construction of a rail
overpass on University Road at Rashid Minhas, and widening and improvement of a
bridge over the Lyari River on Rashid Minhas road (para 3.28).  No resettlement
is involved in the sub-components in the three interior cities. GOS has agreed
in principle to revising its resettlement policy in line with the Bank's OD4.30.
An outline policy statement for GOS has been developed with the help of an IDA
consultant and was discussed with GOS during negotiations (Annex 3) . EXPACO will
coordinate the work of the IDA consultant. Support and monitoring of resettle-
ment planning, implementation, and evaluation, however, will be the responsibil-
ity of PPU. Discussions have been held with SAIBAN, an NGO in Karachi, regarding
its possible  involvement  in execution of resettlement plans.   SAIBAN was
established three years ago for the development of incremental low-cost housing
along the lines of the highly rated Khuda Ki Basti low-income housing project in
Hyderabad.
3.27      The total cost of resettlement is estimated at Rs 14.7 million,
including technical assistance for implementation of resettlement plans.   To
ensure that the various phases of resettlement receive GOS's full attention,
resettlement plans have been developed by KDA with the help of IDA consultants.
These plans have been reviewed by IDA and have been found to be satisfactory.
Aside from a weak policy framework, the most important issue concerning
resettlement actions in Sindh has to do with weak institutional capacities of GOS
(KDA and KMC) . GOS has agreed to strengthen the organizational and operational
capacities of its executing agencies, KDA and KMC, and to implement resettlement
actions through involvement of an NGO such as SAIBAN. Assurances were obtained
from GOS during n-aotiations that any Persons displaced or to be disDlaced for
the purposes of the prolect shall be compensated and/or resettled in accordance
with a land acauisition and resettlement plan satisfactory to the Association
(para 6.1(h)).
3.28      The three resettlement subcomponents in Karachi include:
*    Malir River Flood Protection.  Resettlement of seven small farms,
including six vegetable farms and one poultry farm presently
located in the bed of the river near the section of the bund
which is to be constructed in the proposed project.



- 35 -
*    Construction of Railway OverDass.   Resettlement of 25 small
commercial enterprises situated along the alignments. Half of
the enterprises are one-man operations functioning in open
hutments; the other half are small nurseries.
*    Widening  of Bridae  over Lvari River.    Resettlement  of  10
habitations (eight of which are temporary hutments) and 51 small
commercial enterprises in the project area. Of the enterprises,
24 are functioning in open temporary hutments, two in semi pucca
(block without mortar), and 25 in pucca (block with mortar)
establishments. Since household members of the one residence to
be demolished are involved in a local business, it is unlikely
they will choose to move to another area.   They will receive
assistance in building or purchasing a residence to replace the
one demolished, however.
J. ORerations and Maintenance
3.29      Satisfactory operations and maintenance of the facilities financed
would be a focus of project technical assistance and IDA supervision missions.
The operations and maintenance of the environmental upgrading components will
fall under the responsible executing agency. For storm water drainage, KMC is
responsible for cleaning and KWSB for pumping; for operations and maintenance for
the Malir River flood protection scheme responsibility will lie with KDA. All
of the Karachi traffic improvements will be maintained by KMC. The truck stand
and bus terminals in the three interior cities will be the responsibility of the
municipal committees in each city. Institutional capacities of the executing
agencies for operations and maintenance will be strengthened as a part of the
institutional strengthening subcomponents of sectoral reform.
3.30      In the interior cities, inadequate maintenance of existing roads and
infrastructure results in service deficiencies which could, to a large measure,
be overcome through monitoring procedures. The project will focus on strengthen-
ing municipal government capacity to perform operations and maintenance functions
more effectively.
K. Procurement
3.31      Contracts for the major works (US$25.5 million) will be awarded after
pre-qualifications on the basis of International Competitive Bidding (ICB), in
accordance with World Bank guidelines. Seven separate works contracts will be
awarded: (a) one contract for rehabilitation of storm water drainage (Korangi)
(US$1.7 million); (b) four contracts for Malir river flood protection scheme
(US$13.3 million); (c) one contract for construction of railway bridge on
University Road at Rashid Minhas in Karachi (US$8.2 million); and (d) one
contract for widening of a bridge on Rashid Minhas Road at Lyari River (US$2.3
million).
3.32      Ten separate contracts for other works  (US$8.3 million)  will be
awarded through Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) (as the nature, locality,
seasonality, and dispersal of the works would not be of interest to international
contractors), in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA.  The contracts
will include (a) a total of US$3.1 million divided into: one contract for 16
traffic improvement schemes in Karachi  (US$1.4 million),  two contracts for
installation of traffic signals for pedestrian crossings in Karachi (US$0.6
million), and one contract for moving utilities to install traffic signals in

3.36       Contracts for vehicles (US$0.9 million) and equipment (US$2.2 million)
would be awarded on the basis of LCB procedures acceptable to IDA.   All ICB
contracts, and LCB contracts for civil works over US$0.5 million equivalent and
all equipment contracts over US$200,000 will be subject to prior review by IDA.
The prior review requirements are expected to cover 95% of total procurement.
Procurement arrangements for the prolect were discussed during necotiations.
Procurement documentation for 75% of all physical works and 100% to be tendered
during the first two years of vroiect implementation have been reviewed and found
to be satisfactory to IDA.
L. Disbursements and Special Accounts
3.37       Disbursements by IDA are proposed at the rate of 100l   against eligible
foreign expenditures. All disbursements would be net of identifiable taxes and
duties. Table 3.3 sets forth the categories of items to be financed from the
proceeds of the credit, the allocation of the amounts of the credit to each
category, and the percentage of expenditures for items to be financed in each
category. The estimated schedule of disbursements is in Annex 9. Disbursements
against Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) would be made for the following items:
(a) contracts for works and goods valued at less than $200,000; (b) contracts for
services of consulting firms (not individuals) valued at less than US$100,000;
and (c) municipal training programs.  Documentation in support of the SOEs will
be retained by the executing agencies for inspection by IDA supervision missions.
All other disbursements would be fully documented.

3.38      In order to facilitate disbursements and project implementation, three
Special Accounts would be established: one in GOS, one in KDA, and one in KMC.
These Special Accounts would be established at the National Bank of Pakistan2Li
and operated in accordance with State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) regulations and
would be maintained in US Dollars with an authorized allocation of US$3. 0 million
distributed as follows: US$0.7 million for GOS, US$2.0 million for KDA, and
US$0.3 million for KMC. Each of these Accounts would be used for both local and
foreign expenditures of less than 10% of each special account allocation. All
expenditures above this percentage could be submitted directly to IDA for payment
without using funds from the Special Account. Applications for replenishment of
the Special Account should be submitted to IDA on a monthly basis or whenever the
account balance falls below 50t, whichever occurs first. The Project Director
in each of the above entities would be responsible for record keeping,
aggregation of documents, reconciliation of bank statements as required by IDA,
and preparation of applications for replenishment for signature by.authorized
officials.   Assurances on disbursem*nt arranaements acceDtable to IDA were
obtained from GOS at negotiations (para 6.1(d))
M. Accounts and Audits
3.39      Verification of use of SOEs and Special Accounts on the Karachi
Special Development Project are up to date.   Work on developing effective
accounting systems for KDA and KMC is continuing. This lack of effective systems
has precluded timely receipt of financial statement audit reports of KDA and KMC
as required under the KSDP project.   However,  our actual need for audited
financial statements of these institutions is being reconsidered. All agencies
and departments of GOS are subject to standard government auditing procedures.
Although measures have already been initiated under Credits 1374, 1652, and 1987-
PAK to remedy this situation for KMC and KDA, only KWSB has acquired a sufficient
level of adequacy to satisfy IDA guidelines and standards.   Therefore,  the
project includes technical assistance for GOS and KDA, and to support on-going
assistance for KMC.
3.40      Separate project accounts  (by contracts) would be established and
maintained by each of the executing agencies involved.   Reports for these
accounts will give breakdowns for land acquisition, civil works, vehicles,
materials and equipment, consulting services, technical assistance, training and
studies. Expenditures would be accounted for separately by category for each
fiscal year and be presented in such manner that easy correlation would be
possible with each of the categories shown in the Credit Agreement Schedule One.
3.41      The PPU  (with consultant's assistance)  would be responsible for
consolidating project accounts from each executing agency (GOS, KDA, and KMC) and
participating interior cities, and arranging for annual audits by independent
auditors acceptable to IDA. Annual audits of the consolidated Droiect accounts.
together with audits of 0S3s. recuests for direct reimbursement, and the Special
Accounts will be submitted to IDA no later than nino months after the close of
each fiscal year (para 6.1(e)).
21/   Discussions are presently being held with GOP regarding (a) opening up
these accounts for competition by permitting commercial banks to
participate and (b) modification of SBP regulations to allow for improved
functioning.

N. Monitorine, Evaluation and Reporting
3.42      On March 30 of each year of project implementation, GOS and IDA would
jointly review progress made against targets set out in the action plans and, if
needed, revise them.   Each of the executing entities would prepare detailed
quarterly progress reports to be submitted to the PPU. The PPU will review and
consolidate these reports into a single comprehensive quarterly report for
submission within one month following the end of each reporting quarter to the
Chief Secretary of GOS and to IDA.   The quarterly progress reports would
highlight major problem areas, with suggestions for overcoming them. The reports
would set out the physical and financial data pertaining to each sub-project
component and would measure progress, indicating (a) revised cost estimates for
individual contracts and the total project including best estimates of physical
and price contingencies; b) revised timing of procurement actions, including
advertising, bidding, contracts awarded and completion times; and (c). the status
of implementation of contracts awarded.
3.43      GOS would also submit to IDA a project completion report six months
following the closing date of the credit.  Durina negotiations, assurances were
obtained from GOS that the PPU would Prepare and submit to IDA consolidated
cuarterly Progress reports  on prolect implementation during the Dreceding
ouarter.   During negotiations assurances were also obtained to hold 'a mid-term
review about two years after the date of credit effectiveness not later than
September 30, 1995.   The purpose of the review would be to assess progress
achieved in project implementation and to agree with GOS on mid-course
adjustments where necessary, (paras. 6.1(f) and (g)).
0. Proiect Supervision
3.44      The average supervision coefficient for urban projects in the region
is 15 staff weeks per year. Because the proposed project is complex and policy-
based, a total of approximately 20 staff weeks per year may be required. The
additional resources of 5 staff weeks are expected to come from various trust
funds obtained during the course of project implementation. Funds provided under
the proposed credit would cover the cost of local and internationally recruited
consultants to assist the PPU in their routine monitoring of the project.  A
supervision plan was prepared (Annex 13) and discussed during negotiations.
3.45      Project supervision would commence with a project launch workshop to
be held within three months after Board approval. The objective of the workshop
would be to convene the executing agencies and their project staffs in one venue
for a period of about three to four days, to ensure a thorough review with IDA
staff of the various project documents (e.g., Staff Appraisal Report, Project
Review Forms ,  and IDA and GOS legal documentation),  to acquire a better
understanding of project requirements and procedures, including a review of the
action plans and roles and relationships of the various groups involved. The
project launch workshop would also introduce the "project workbook" as a means
to enhance communication among the various government units involved in policy
formulation and implementation.
22/   Project Review Forms (PRF) are brief four to six page appraisal reports of
each of the individual investments or sub-components. PRFs were prepared
for each of the investments in the proposed project to serve as an aid for
the PPU during the supervision of the project and ISCU in developing and
implementing the institutional strengthening components.

P. Environmental Impact
3.46      The environmental impact of the proposed project would be positive.
The relocation of the truck and bus terminals in Nawabshah, Larkana, and
Mirpurkhas would improve the environment and increase local productivity by
reduction of: (a) noise levels due to congestion relief measures and (b) traffic
related hazards from less traffic congestion. Traffic management and construc-
tion of bridges in Karachi would result in lower accident rates and smoother
traffic flow along main corridors. The traffic management studies would produce
better understanding of traffic circulation and pedestrian needs and help in
developing programs to encourage environmentally sustainable modal choice. Both
of the bridges, at the railway crossing on University Road and on Rashid Minhas
over the Lyari River, would directly improve the environment by reductions in
vehicle idling time and exhaust emissions.  The Malir River Flood Protection
investment constitutes the final phase of works which brings flood protection to
all of the residents and firms located in the Korangi area, an area of low income
households and medium to large-sized industries.   Both the flood protection
investment and the channelization of the outfall reaches of the Korangi nallah
constitute immediate and first steps in GOS's program to improve the environment
in Korangi. The environmental category of the proposed project is a "B."
3.47      While it is acknowledged that the environmental impact of the proposed
project would be positive, there would be temporary disruptions caused by
construction activities of some of the drainage and transport components in
Karachi, which are not related to the long-term environmental impacts of the
project. The Malir River Flood Protection investment and the two bridges are
expected to be the primary source of these disruptions during construction. In
the case of flood protection, large quantities of earth must be borrowed,
transported, put in place, and stabilized. For the two bridges, and the traffic
management investments located in Karachi, and the relocation and construction
of two bus terminals and one truck stand in the interior cities, noise,
disruption of traffic and access to homes or businesses, and dust are potential
temporary disruptions.  These impacts have been reviewed by IDA.  Mitigation
measures, the responsible agencies and monitoring measures have been identified
and have been incorporated in the tender documents.
IV. COST RECOVERY AND AFFORDABILITY
4.1       The proposed project would prepare the foundation for more effective
cost recovery measures to be implemented as part of the policy reform program
during the project's implementation period.  Because of the wide disbursal of
both the environmental upgrading and transport improvement components in Karachi
and the three interior cities, it is not feasible to directly recover any
significant portion of project costs from consumers. The basic strategy that GOS
and the executing agencies would pursue is to strengthen the overall resource
mobilization capabilities of the Excise and Taxation Department of GOS, including
improvements in property tax administration.  Property tax is a local tax and
thus will (indirectly) recover most of the costs of the physical works under the
project: flood protection, drainage, transport improvements, and traffic
management investments.
4.2       Most  of  the  project  costs  would  be  recovered  indirectly  from
beneficiaries. More specifically:
(a) the GOS would implement a program of property tax reform aiming at a
yield increase of at least 100% by FY97;



- 41 -
(b) the GOS has raised its existing motor vehicle tax rate by 10% and
would pursue conversion of the tax to an ad valorem basis at a one
percent rate by FY95;
(c) KMC increased octroi charges by 13% in September 30, 1992 as an
interim revenue generation measure, pending the envisaged increase in
property tax yield and in the long-term, eventual assumption of
responsibility for property tax assessment and collection; and
(d) KDA will, as part of the proposed amendment of the Sindh Disposal of
Plots Ordinance, implement a program of disposal of its vacant
serviced land at market rates for plots larger than 120 sq. yds., by
auction. 23/
4.3       Additionally, administrative measures to be designed and/or implement-
ed under the proposed project to enhance the effectiveness of revenue collection
in the above agencies would further increase direct and indirect cost recovery
of past investments as well as future investments.
4.4       The imposition of taxes outlined in the previous section would help
bring the municipal taxation levels in Karachi closer to the levels in other
countries at comparable levels of development (i.e., India and Sri Lanka).
Because GOS has implemented an increase in property tax rates (as a condition of
negotiations) and has agreed to revalue all properties, the preponderance of
taxes would fall on the middle and higher income groups.   Given the present
extremely low levels of taxation (e.g., real property tax levels have declined
to about 14% of what they were in 1968), the proposed increases are almost
certainly affordable.   KDA sales of land at subsidized prices have so far
primarily benefited speculators and informal land vendors. They have in the past
resold the land at prices significantly higher than those charged by KDA. Thus,
the benefits of such subsidies accrue to intermediaries, rather than to the
ultimate residents, who rely on the informal land market to obtain plots (without
legal title) disposed of by KDA and other agencies. The proposed measures would
ensure that a greater proportion of land prices paid by the ultimate beneficia-
ries would end up in the public coffers rather than in the hands of intermediar-
ies, with little impact on market prices.
4.5       The cost of constructing the truck terminal in Nawabshah would be
recovered from about 200 truckers who would have access to better facilities,
including workshop, office space, and secure parking.
V. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Benefits and Beneficiaries
5.1       The benefits of the physical components of the proposed project would
include: improved environmental and health conditions of the urban population;
reduction in damage to property resulting from flooding; increased land values
in the upgraded areas; cost savings, such as reduced maintenance costs for
various urban infrastructure components and lower vehicle operating costs for
urban transport; and improved services. The benefits of the policy reforms to
23/ KDA has recently adopted market pricing for plots larger than 400 square
yards, but has agreed to reduce plot sizes for auctioned land to plots
larger than 120 square yards.



- 42 -
be carried out under the proposed project would be in terms of improvements in
fiscal and financial autonomy and sustainability, allowing governments to finance
investment and cover recurrent costs of meeting the growing demand for urban
infrastructure.   Better control of investments would--over time--facilitate
faster completion of projects, advancing the time in which investment benefits
can be  realized.    Institutional  strengthening  would  result  in  increased
efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of urban services.  Procedures would
be streamlined and the cost of service provision reduced.
5.2       Project beneficiaries would be the urban population of Sindh in
general and, more directly, the people living in Karachi and in the interior
cities that would receive investments under the proposed project.
B. Economic Evaluation
5.3       The major physical components of the proposed project have a total
cost of US$38.2 million (65* of total project costs including contingencies).
The overall economic rate of return (ERR) is about 43%, which is a weighted
average of the physical investments for which an ERR was calculated.   The
remaining project costs (35% of the total) are allocated to technical assistance
including institutional support and capacity building, policy development through
advisory assignments, and training for which an ERR cannot be calculated.
5.4       Interior  Cities.    The  total  cost  for  the  road  and  transport.
infrastructure investments is estimated to be US$6.0 million or about 10.2% of
total cost. Although these improvements would result in congestion relief in the
central business district, better maintenance, and better service to commuters,
it is difficult to assign an ERR to these benefits as the beneficiaries are
fragmented among three cities and over a large geographical area within each of
the three cities. Furthermore, similar investments and their ERRs have not been
established previously in Pakistan. Overall, a positive economic rate of return
is anticipated as indicated by assessments of similar small transport improve-
ments in other countries.
5.5       Environmental Ungrading.   The economic benefits of environmental
upgrading programs would vary widely and would be reflected by improvements in
health and property values. Given the nature of the works, it is difficult, if
not impossible, to assign an economic rate of return to these benefits. As an
indication, however, of more comprehensive area upgrading in higher density areas
of Karachi under Credit 1652-PAK and ADB loan 793-PAK (SF), an ERR has been
established at about 60% for this fifth phase of the flood protection project
(para 3.5 and Annex 7).
5.6       Bridaes.  The economic rate of return for the bridge expansion over
Lyari river was calculated using savings in vehicle operating costs. The project
would result in substantial benefits in travel times for the diverted traffic
which has not been included in the ERR calculations. The ERR over the project
life of 20 years was calculated at 26% (for details see Annex 12) . The ERR for
the overhead bridge construction on University road was calculated using benefits
in terms of reduction in vehicle operating costs (VOC) and passenger travel
times. The cost of providing roads to divert traffic during the construction
phase is expressed as negative benefits in the economic evaluation of the "with
project" scenario. The ERR over the project life of 20 years was calculated at
34%. Even with a cost overrun of 20% or reduced savings from VOC, the ERR is
expected to be greater than 20%. Substantial benefits (improved traffic flow,
reduced vehicle idling and lower emissions, lower accident rate, and better
environment) from the two bridges, which are difficult to quantify are not



- 4 3 -
included in this analysis. Thus the project yields satisfactory rates of return
even under conservative scenarios.
5.7       Traffic  Manazement.    The  ERR  was  computed  for  this  component
considering savings from reduction in VOCs (fuel consumption, lubricants, tires,
parts, maintenance, labor) and passenger travel times. The savings have been
derived as a consequence of reduction in running times and stopped-time delays
encountered as a result of congestion and bottlenecks. The weighted ERR for all
intersection improvements is calculated at 24.8%. Even with a cost overrun of
20% or reduced savings from VOC, the ERR is expected to be more than 20%.
C. Risks
5.8       There are serious political risks in Sindh and particularly in Karachi
as evidenced by political instability, civil disturbances, and military
intervention of the last two years. Military intervention over the last eighteen
months has reduced the incidence of urban and rural violence and civil unrest,
but the underlying political and economic causes for the violence and unrest have
not been resolved.  Project implementation could be affected by law and order
difficulties and further political turmoil causing delays in the execution of
works and implementation of policy reforms. However, we believe that these risks
are manageable and that IDA support remains fully justified given the strong
support of the Provincial Government, the City of Karachi, and the three interior
cities to the project and the important role Karachi plays in Pakistan's economy..
These risks are considered worth taking when Karachi is viewed from the
perspective of its contribution to the economic growth of the country. Karachi
contributes over 20% to GDP and is the principal seaport of the country, and thus
plays a pivotal role in Pakistan pursuing its export-led growth strategy.
5.9       In addition to political  risk,  there is the risk of delays  in
implementation, particularly in implementation of the policy reforms and action
plans, including resettlement plans. The resettlement and action plans for the
project were reviewed and found satisfactory during negotiations. These plans
will help achieve the minimum policy objectives which are attainable within the
project's implementation period.  Substantial steps have already been undertaken
by GOS and its agencies towards implementation of the action plans, which are set
on relatively conservative time-schedules. Additionally, substantial advisory
support is provided under the project to facilitate implementation of the action
plans. GOS has agreed under the project, to strengthening its (and that of its
agencies) institutional capacities for implementation of resettlement projects,
in general, and for resettlement specifically included under SSDP, including
creation of a special autonomous institutional arrangement (by contracting some
services out to a private sector NGO that is experienced in these matters) for
implementation and monitoring of the resettlement plan, and for helping to
institutionalize these strengths within GOS.
5.10      There  is also a risk  that  GOS  commitment  to the project  and,
especially, the policy measures might weaken.  However, the project has been
prepared by different governments in Sindh and the policy statement has been
confirmed by the newly elected government.
5.11      There  are  no  other  unusual  risks  to  project  implementation.
Infrastructure to be provided under the project is generally comparable to
projects implemented by executing agencies in the past and does not provide any
unusual technical difficulties.  There are no major outstanding land acquisition
requirements which cannot be satisfied.   Possible administrative delays in
recruitment of consultants and in procurement have been safeguarded against
through the establishment of the PPU and the advisory support provided to it to



- 44 -
give project  implementation  and procurement  a head  start.    In addition,
substantial work has been completed in preparation of consultants' terms of
reference.
5.12      Other Risks.  The Federal Shariat Court of Pakistan has recently given
a ruling that the Shariah does not permit the payment or award of interest and
thus has instructed the Government to modify a number of existing laws that
currently provide for the payment of interest.   The Government has filed an
appeal with the Supreme Court against the Shariah ruling, which has been stayed
pending the outcome of the appeal. As far as Pakistan's obligations under loan,
credit and guarantee agreements with the Bank/IDA are concerned, these are valid
and enforceable under international law, in accordance with the terms of those
agreements and the General Conditions of the Bank/IDA, notwithstanding any

SINDH SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Statement of Policies on Fiscal and Administrative Reform
in the Government of Sindh
BACKGROUND
1.        GOS has adopted the premise that development and sustainability of the
province are linked to its role as both regulator and supporter of the private
sector and local governments.   Since GOS will have to serve as the prime
"intermediary" for financing development, it will have to stabilize its financial
situation to sustainable levels and become creditworthy in domestic public and
private markets.
2.        There are thus five primary objectives to GOS's strategy.
First, make Karachi self-financing and sustainable, as far as
possible.
Second, stabilize GOS's finances to sustainable levels.
Third, make GOS creditworthy in domestic capital markets.
Fourth, strengthen GOS's regulatory and support roles vis a vis the
private sector and local governments, its two main instrumentalities.
Fifth, strengthen local governments. To maintain sustainability and
to get the incentives right, GOS will have to deregulate its principal
sectors (e.g., transport and water services) and decentralize fiscal
and administrative authority to local governments.
POLICY STATEMENT
3.        The goal of the SSDP program is to help GOS, during a time of severe
fiscal  constraint,  (a)  continue  the momentum  of  its  ongoing  volicv  and
institutional reform Program and (b) finance certain high priority investment
proiects that are included in its five year infrastructure expenditures program.
The SSDP program aims at helping GOS support the macro-economic and structural
reform programs of GOP to improve economic growth through deregulation, export
growth, and privatization, and supporting the country's Social Action Program by
creating an enabling environment that:
(a) permits greater freedom in the flow of the factors of production,
(b) supports broad-based and sustainable economic growth throughout the
province, and



- 47 -
Annex 1
Page 2 of 5
(c) sustains investments in priority sectors to provide improved social
services.
4.        To achieve acceptable investment levels, GOS will have to attain (and
then sustain) financial stability and creditworthiness, first in public and then
in private capital markets. To do this, GOS will implement and sustain a program
of structural reforms which is expected to result in:
(a) a gradual reduction of GOS's current account fiscal deficit by raising
additional revenues, reducing low priority current expenditures, and
decreasing subsidies;
(b) provision of more rupee funds to priority projects by sharp cuts in
GOS's low priority existing portfolio of on-going projects,
terminating or bringing to an early close projects that have low
economic returns or other implementation difficulties;
(c) annual reviews of the composition and size of the Provincial ADP so
that the investment program is consistent with GOS's economic
development and social action objectives and its capacity for
servicing its debt and project supervision;
(d) introduction of a three-year investment, planning, programming and
budgeting system and reformulation of investment planning and
financing procedures, if necessary, to assure that GOS supports
investments in all sectors that are economically and socially sound
and provide tangible benefits to the province.
(e)  gradually   decentralize,   granting   greater   autonomy   to   the
municipalities as they acquire additional absorptive capacity,
strengthening local governments and modifying GOS's role toward more
regulatory and supportive responsibilities as the municipalities gain
greater independence;
(f) facilitate efficient and equitable functioning of land markets in
Sindh;
(g) develop a regulatory framework for environmental protection;
(h)  deregulate  urban  transport  services,   improve  coordination  of
transport-related activities, and establish a regulatory framework
aimed at affordable mass transport and wider modal choice; and
(i) establish a regulatory framework for water services in Karachi aimed
at liberalization of water tariffs, more progressive water pricing
that fosters improved water conservation, and increased delegation of
financial and administrative authority to KWSB.
I. FISCAL AND FINANCIAL REFORM
5.        The policy objective of fiscal and financial reform for GOS is to
stabilize its finances and achieve creditworthiness (first in public and then in
private capital markets). Financial stabilization and creditworthiness will
enable the GOS to channel the resources of the public sector more effectively.



- 48 -
Annex 1
Page 3 of 5
6.        The primary means for attaining this goal for GOS is to spend within
the limits of available revenues and borrowing capacity. For GOS to reduce its
budgetary deficit while maintaining a reasonable level of growth in per capita
development expenditures, it will have to limit its current expenditure growth
and increase revenues. Since property and motor vehicle taxes represent two very
important and relatively untapped revenue bases for GOS, every effort should be
made to increase revenues and to improve both property tax and motor vehicle tax
administration.
II. ADMNIMSTRATIVE REFORM
7.        The policy objective of administrative reform is to develop GOS's
regulatory role and capacity in support of local government's provision of social
services and as enabler and facilitator of private sector economic activity in
Sindh. This will involve GOS in redefining its role from that of a "first line"
executing institution to an "intermediary" that accomplishes the task of economic
and social development of the province mainly through an enabling regulatory
framework aimed at the private sector, local governments, and other agencies.
This regulatory role will demand of GOS a much improved fiscal and administrative
environment and a different orientation to and definition of its "client."
8.        The following tasks would be involved:
(a) revision of laws, rules, or regulations;
(b)  strengthening   of   fiscal   administration,   primarily   through
strengthening of property tax administration, privatization of
commercial undertakings, and increased efficiency in utilization of
manpower;
(c)  strengthening  of  financial  administration,   involving  improved
financial accounting and budgeting, forecasting, and financial
management;
(d)  strengthening  of  regulatory  administration,   redefining  GOS's
regulatory role and practices in development finance, audit,
procurement, resettlement, environmental standards, and performance
monitoring;
(e) strengthening of development administration, particularly GOS's and
local governments' capacity in development programming & budgeting and
in selection, supervision, and monitoring of investment projects, and
restructuring of KDA's role and function with reorientation to
development of low-income shelter and contract management services for
the public sector;
(f)  strengthening  of  records  administration  (personnel  records  and
management systems); and
(g) decentralization to local governments as they develop capacity.

III. LAND MANAGEMENT REFORM
9.        The future of the province will depend to a considerable extent on
GOS's capability to attract and support the financial, technological and human
capital investments that will be necessary for economic growth to occur and to
be sustainable in the province, which in turn depends on the availability of
negotiable secure land suitable for industry, commercial, and residential
development and investments as well as the operation of secure and transparent
land and mortgage markets. Thus policy reforms will be necessary in the areas
of lowering land transaction costs, land pricing, land-use regulation,
public/private sector roles and tenure.
IV. URBAN TRANSPORT REFORM
10.       The policy objective is to restructure the urban transport sector.
This will involve:
(a) deregulation of urban transport (including deregulation of bus fares,
restrictions on licensing of types of buses), development of a scheme
for funding of bus leases and purchases by the private sector, and
reduction of subsidies, leading to the privatization of KTC;
(b) strengthening of GOS's regulatory role in support of privatization of
public transport.
V. URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL REFORM
11.       The policy objective is to develop standards for the province relating
to pollution abatement, and a regulatory framework through which GOS can support
and monitor implementation of and adherence to these standards.
VI. WATER SERVICES REFORM
12.       The policy objective is to increase delegation of authority for water
services administration in Sindh over the long term and for Karachi to prepare
KWSB for increased administrative and financial autonomy in the medium term.
This will involve:
(a) increase KWSB's autonomy as it develops the capability for self-
financing, and
(b) increase delegation to other water authorities in the province as they
develop capacity.
VII. LOCAL GOVERNMENT REFORM
13.       The policy objective is to assist local governments in working toward
increasing levels of financial and operational independence, specifically with
respect   to  planning,   financing,   operating,   and  maintaining  necessary
infrastructure and social services. For KMC, the policy objective is to prepare
KMC for taking on full responsibility for the fiscal and administrative functions
of greater metropolitan Karachi, including improving its capacity for planning
and financing infrastructure projects for Karachi, thus making it possible for



- 5 -                      Annex 1
Page 5 of 5
the GOS to devote a larger proportion of its attention to the interior of the
province. Implementation of the policy objective will involve:
(a) strengthening of local governments in financial and development
administration and revenue generation,
(b)  assisting local governments in establishing programs to contain the
growth of recurrent expenditures, and
(c) implementation of decentralization to local governments as they
develop the capacity for increased authority and responsibility.

PAKISTAN
SINDH SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ACTION PLAN FOR DEVELOPMENT OF RESETTLEMENT POLICY
A.    Background and Objectives
1.    Several  institutions  and  laws  presently  deal with  the  problems  of
encroachment and resettlement, with no uniformity in operational procedures and
practices. The Directorate of Sindh Katchi Abadi of GOS and the Directorate of
Ratchi Abadi of KMC are charged with the responsibility of regularizing
unauthorized settlements in the Province. The Board of Revenue (BOR) has the
authority for transfer and sale of land and for setting the terms and conditions
for land-use and providing leases to private users of land. Local bodies (KMC)
and specialized agencies (KDA) are authorized to remove encroachments according
to their own internal procedures. Police have the power to remove encroachments
on behalf of government agencies.
2.    Most of the unauthorized settlements have been haphazardly planned on
informal subdivisions.   The illegal occupation of government land is often
followed by litigation with the squatters generally receiving a stay order from
the courts, pending a judgement which takes a very long time. Various forms of
encroachments lead to illegal possession of about 1,000 acres of government land
in the Province every year. At the same time, the housing needs for the low-
income population continues to grow.
3.    There is no explicit government policy regarding resettlement.  However,
the government does have a policy of regularization of unauthorized settlements
and removal of encroachment, based on a policy adopted in 1978 to transfer legal
tenure to the occupants through the upgrading of settlements on a cost recovery
basis. According to this policy, all unauthorized settlements existing on or
before January 1978 were to be regularized. However, the regularization program
in Karachi could not be implemented effectively and KMC has been able to
regularize only about 18,000 out of an approximate 223,000 houses in Baldia
alone.
4.    The major reasons for ineffective implementation of a regularization policy
have been: a) institutional problems and lack of organizational capacity on the
part of the government; b) inconsistency of the policy with socio-economic
reality; c) lack of participation by affected communities; and d) legal
complexities and inconsistencies in the land tenure system.
5.    The objective of this component is to develop a resettlement policy in the
context of an integrated approach to socio-economic development rather than just
as an appendix to implementation of engineering projects. Resettlement policy
formulation will be coordinated by EXPACO, but support and monitoring of
resettlement planning, implementation, and evaluation will be the responsibility
of PPU working with local NGOs.

B.    Action Plan
6.    The problems in resettlement are closely connected to broader institutional
problems and there is a need to begin working both inside and outside the GOS to
shape appropriate legislation, administrative,  and planning practices.   The
framework to develop such a plan will include:
(a) development of a policy framework on the part of GOS on the first
principles for a resettlement policy, taking into account Bank
guidelines, specifically O.D 4.30;
(b) preparation of an action plan to develop a policy on the basis of
accepted first principles with assistance from individuals who have
demonstrated experience and expertise in resettlement policy issues,
and identification of a mechanism for formulation of policy, and
procedural requirements for its formal adoption by the GOS;
(c) preparation of a framework for guidance and supervision of NGOs and
individuals working on resettlement issues; and
(d) based on experience and data collected in the field, submission of
recommendations to a Resettlement Committee (to be formed) for policy
drafting.
7.   Discussions have been held with SAIBAN, an NGO in Karachi, regarding its
possible involvement in development and execution of resettlement plans. As the
social organizer initiating the resettlement process, SAIBAN would be expected
to play the lead role in planning, designing, and implementing the resettlement.
Involvement of other individuals and NGOs has the advantage of creating a broader
base of expertise in this field.

SINDH SPECIAL  DEVELONMIT PROCECT
OUTLN  TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTANTS INPUTS
FISCAL AND ADHINSTRATWVE REFORM
1. Propmrt Tax Refonn
A.    Bakground and Obectves
1.    The property tax yield in Karachi has steadily declined over the years and
now forms only 0.3% of the total tax revenues. The reasons for low yield are:
(a) lack of tax revaluation since 1968; (b) a number of properties exempted from
paying tax; (c) inefficient organizational structure and administrative
procedures; (d) lack of property valuation and assessment expertise; (e) failure
to extend rated area; (f) lack of clarity of title, as land rights are often not
being recorded; and (g) poor collection performance.   Land registration and
management are inadequate, with land being produced by the public sector at below
market prices, creating serious market distortions, and the informal sector
meeting almost 75% of the annual housing requirements. In Karachi, for example,
over 250,000 fully serviced plots lie unoccupied due to under pricing by the
public sector.
2.    The objective of this consultancy is to improve the property tax system
first in Karachi and then in three interior cities (Nawabshah, Larkana, and
Mirpurkhas).   The tax yield will be addressed through an expansion of the
property tax net, improvement in property tax administration, revision of land-
use and building regulations for Karachi as required, selling of land at market
prices, possible increase in rates, updating of the property tax list, reduction
of exemptions for favorable treatment for owner-occupiers, revaluation, improved
collection performance, and establishment of institutional arrangements to
monitor tax policies for economic and financial impacts on households and firms
in Sindh.
B.    Scope of Work
3.    The consultants will work closely with the Excise and Taxation Department,
GOS, to carry out the following tasks:
(a)  conduct an indepth study of property tax administration to provide
decision makers greater flexibility in its application, including
flexibility regarding the scope and means of the following: coverage,
setting tax rates, exemptions, revaluation, and buoyancy;
(b)  improve    internal    administrative    systems    and   procedures,
computerization, maps and records;



- 59 -
Annex 4
Page 2 of .0
(c) implement a detailed action plan resulting in revaluation, updating
the property tax list, improved valuation methods and collection
efficiency;
(d) establish training facilities and undertake a training program to
improve the valuation, technical and administrative needs of the GOS
Department of Excise and Taxation; and
(e) identify and institutionalize all necessary technology, including
transportation, map utilization, training and office equipment, and
computers.
2. Investment Planning and Budgeting
3. Financial Management
A.  Background and Objectives
1.        The four core GOS departments  (Planning and Development,  Finance,
Excise and Taxation, and Board of Revenue) operate without a clear perspective
on provincial development planning, programming and budgeting (PPB). Under the
recent changes in financial arrangements, as implied by the NFC award, the GOS
will become increasingly less dependent on fiscal transfers from the Federal
Government, and the GOS departments will have to assume a collective
responsibility for developing common (or complementary) strategies and multi-year
public sector investment plans. This will require a significant re-orientation
in the planning perspective as well as a strong inter-departmental coordination
to integrate planning with programming and budgeting and resource development.
2.        The objective of this consultancy is to:  (a)  improve investment
planning and budgeting (project identification and appraisal procedures and
practices, changes in budgetary and planning procedures to include a three-year
budget plan); (b) support improvements at the municipal government level to
finance, operate and maintain the proposed investments, and provide technical
assistance to improve cost recovery procedures; and (c) strengthen the financial
and administrative capability of GOS.
B.        Scope of Work
3.        Investment Planninat and Budaetina.  The consultants will assist GOS
in evaluating the performance of the investment program in terms of meeting the
needs for economic growth, social welfare, regional development, sectoral
balance, and in identifying policy changes that strengthen the investment
program. The tasks involved are:
(a) conduct a survey of all existing ADP-financed development portfolio
projects currently under execution in Sindh;
(b) identify criteria for establishing priorities for development and
projects;
(c) identify the development priorities for GOS and show how the on-going



- 60 -
Annex 4
Page 3 of 10
investment programs respond to them;
(d) categorize all on-going projects according to their prospects for
completion of works (or program), immediate and long-term economic and
financial returns, future funding availability, meeting current
developmental priorities, and eliminate those projects;
(e) introduce public expenditure management procedures and practices to
establish three year investment planning, programming and budgeting
in GOS;
(f) strengthen P&D's project cycle capability, including review of
existing appraisal criteria, guidelines, and manuals and introduce
modifications to enhance their effectiveness, and revitalization of
existing project monitoring function;
(g) monitor and test the project appraisal criteria and guidelines and
train staff in their application; and
(h) provide training for senior and middle level officials of the four
core departments in integrated investment planning, programming and
budgeting.
4.        To support similar improvements in investment planning and finance in
municipal governments, the consultants will assist GOS to:
(a) review and modify guidelines for preparation of infrastructure
investment programs for secondary cities;
(b) develop a consolidated set of municipal government borrowing
guidelines as a basis for mutual planning and programming;
(c) identify and introduce necessary legal changes in the Sindh Local
Government Ordinance (SLGO) and other legal instruments to enable the
municipal committees to assume increased financial and administrative
responsibilities;
(d) design and implement technical assistance and training programs for
the municipal government personnel at various levels in improved
planning, programming, budgeting and implementation of investments and
operations and maintenance of infrastructure.
5.        Financial  Management.    The  consultants will  assist  the  Finance
Department to:
(a) decrease the current account deficit;
(b) reduce subsidies;
(c) identify and implement strategies for containment of low-priority
recurrent expenditures, and to strengthen financial administration
including: determination of manpower strength, identification of
redundant manpower, development of measures to reduce and contain



- 61 -
Annex 4
Page 4 of 10
redundant manpower, development of measures to reduce and contain
growth in manpower, and consumption expenditures, and planning, and
other measures to reduce or contain recurrent expenditures;
(d) computerize financial accounting, monitoring, and reporting systems
and procedures, and review and update computerization of payroll;
(e) standardize provincial and local government accounting practices;
(f) establish financial forecasting procedures and general strengthening
of financial administration and planning in GOS; and
(g) strengthen public auditing procedures.
INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING
1. KDA
A.  Back2round and Obiectives
1.        The rapidly declining financial position of KDA over the past few
years coupled with increased urbanization of Sindh and the emergence of an urban
political constituency has brought an awareness that the agency is unsustainable
with its present structure and mode of operations. In addition to introducing
some emergency measures to halt KDA's financial slide and set the stage for
reorienting KDA towards a sustainable operation, GOS/KDA developed an overall
Corporate Development Plan (CDP) comprising the following main elements: a
statement of mandate/mission for the agency; objectives and goals arising
therefrom; strategies to achieve those objectives; and resource requirements and
concrete medium-term action plans to implement the strategies, including an
administrative action plan, a divestiture plan, a manpower development plan, and
a financial plan.
2.        The objective of this consultancy is to assist KDA in implementing its
CDP.
B.        Scope of Work
3.        The consultants will assist KDA to:
(a) review options and develop a long-term action plan to privatize the
land development operations of KDA, as well as options and a long-term
action plan for execution of large civil works for the metropolitan
area of Karachi with a focus on low-cost housing;
(b) strengthen the development wing in KDA for improving its contract
management capacity;
(c) computerize all record management systems of KDA, in particular, those
related to land development, and financial and management reporting
systems;



- 62 -
Annex 4
Page 5 of 10
(d)  strengthen  its  base mapping  capacity  to enable  improvement  and
updating of the property list to enhance administration of the
property tax and to provide base maps for other users in Karachi;
(e)  reformulate  land  use  and  building  control  regulatory  statutory
controls   for  Karachi,   especially  addressing  the  impact  of
environmental considerations;
(f)  develop and implement a proper financial accounting system in KDA
including, a detailed review of current statutory accounting and
financial reporting procedures, design sample management reports and
annual financial statements;
(g)  establish and strengthen a resettlement cell to manage development and
implementation of resettlement plans associated with KDA's physical
works; and
(h)  train KDA staff in the new system, including preparation of management
reports, budgetary control information, and data analysis and various
aspects of land management.
2. KM4C
A. Background and Objectives
1.        In its present state, KMC has neither the managerial capacity nor the
requisite authority to satisfactorily perform the functional requirements of a
city government for a city the size of Karachi.  Responsibility for critical
functions in city management are fragmented and reside with several governmental
and non-governmental bodies. Personnel, recruitment, administrative, and fiscal
responsibilities are basically dictated by GOS. This centralization of authority
acts to stifle real development of city management and results in inefficiency
and unnecessary delays in project execution and delivery of services.
2.        The objective of the consultancy is to strengthen and modernize the
operations of KMC to: (a) examine issues of functional responsibility and
coordination; (b) review organizational structure of KRC to enhance coordination
among key departments; (c) strengthen manpower capacity; (d) examine policy
making, planning and operational management; (e) further strengthen accounting
system operations; (f) modernize land record systems and procedures, including
computerization of records management operations; and develop a training
capability.
B.        ScoRe of Work
3.        The consultants will assist KMC to:
(a)  develop a short and long-term Corporate Plan for the provision of
services to the city. The plan will, inter alia, comprise assessments
of the technical and financial demands of each subsector, the
structure and functions of KNC, internal organization and management
and identification of system and procedural changes to improve
internal planning, and budgetary and decision making machinery;



- 63 -
Annex 4
Page 6 of 10
(b) establish a development wing and develop a project management
capability;
(c) examine relationship of KMC to other parastatal and government
organizations and agencies involved in various aspects of city
government, including its relationship to the Zonal Municipal
Committees (ZMCs);
(d) modernize land records systems and procedures;
(e) develop a resettlement policy and establish related operational
procedures;
(f) determine additional needs for and implement computerization of
records management and management information systems for financial
management accounting, budget auditing, revenue, expenditure, etc. to
meet priority needs of KMC; and
(g) design and develop a training center to improve human resource
capacity and train concerned staff members in various aspects of land
management.
INVESTMENT PROGRAM PREPARATION
1. Karachi Urban Transport
A.  Background and Obiectives
1.        The rapid growth in Karachi's population coupled with economic growth
have led to a demand for transportation services that has not been matched by
sufficient investment in infrastructure and services, resulting in serious
deterioration of traffic and public transport conditions.  Public sector bus
service, provided by KTC, has suffered from poor performance for many years
(incurring monthly losses of over Rs 10 million) and is unable to satisfy travel
demand.   Private sector bus services are efficient and cost effective, but
restrictions on operating minibuses, low fares, and little access to foreign
exchange have discouraged investment and produced a decline in services. There
is an urgent need to reorient the institutional structure to establish favorable
policies and effective regulations which promote mass transport use and reduce
the  dependence  on private  personalized  transport.    In  addition,  with  a
substantial growth in auto ownership and use, the existing measures to regulate
traffic are no longer sufficient.
2.        The Government commissioned a study in 1987 which has proposed the
creation of a mass urban transport system for Karachi over the next 15 to 20
years, in absence of which the share of private automobile use will increase to
environmentally unsustainable levels. The cornerstone of the proposed system is
the construction of an 87 km network of exclusive transitway (with minimal
conflict with other vehicular traffic) for bus transport over the more congested
corridors of the city, which could be converted to light rail when bus corridors
become saturated and increased capacity is required.



- 64 -
Annex 4
Page 7 of 10
3.        The objective of the consultancies is to: (a) carry out detailed
engineering design, procurement documentation, environmental impact assessment,
and resettlement plans for the first corridor of the proposed bus transitway from
city center to Sohrab Goth; (b) prepare infrastructure and related vehicle design
criteria to serve as a guide to the detailed design of the entire system; (c)
prepare BOT terms of reference, invite proposals for implementation of the
system, and evaluate proposals; (d) prepare an environmental impact assessment
and resettlement plans for the second corridor of the proposed bus transitway;
and (e) strengthen policy and institutional environment of the transport sector
and initiate urban transport studies to enable a more private sector-led and
market-based approach to take hold.
B.   Scope of Work
4.        Environmental  Impact  Study.    The  consultants  will  conduct  an
environmental impact study (EIS) of the proposed first and second corridor of the
proposed bus transitway covering both construction and operation of the system
to address issues related to:
(a) identification of resources that are irretrievably committed;
(b) identification of alternative actions or programs that could achieve
the objective in more environmentally acceptable ways;
(c) identification of secondary short-term and long-term benefits to the
people and the economy;
(d) evaluation of traffic regulation measures, such as speed, lighting,
emission control, and land use planning, zoning, and land management;
(e) displacement of households and firms located alongside the transitway
alignment and resettlement; and
(f) intrusion of privacy (noise, obstruction of view, etc.) along the
segment which passes through residential apartments.
5.        Data Collection and Information Generation.  The consultants will
assist in:
(a) preparation of maps and topographic surveys to represent actual
conditions where construction is to be designed;
(b) preparation of technical specifications and drawings to carry out soil
investigations, including borings, test pits, exploratory trenches,
etc. that may be necessary to guide project designs;
(c) evaluation of the findings of the soil investigation and establishment
of foundation and pavement design conditions to be used; and
(d) evaluation of alternative options for a targeted and limited
subsidized bus operation to deal with the financial burden of KTC.



- 65 -
Annex 4
Page 8 of 10
6.        Engineering Design.  The consultants will prepare reports on:
(a)  detailed design and cost estimates  for the  15.2 km convertible
transitway, extending from the CBD to Sohrab Goth;
(b)  convertible transitway design criteria to apply for operation as
busways convertible to LRT and roadway improvements related to the
transitway construction;
(c)  detailed design of central administration, operations, and maintenance
facility, including bus depots for maintenance and overnight bus
parking and bus terminals;
(d)  vehicle outline design criteria to apply to buses, LRT vehicles, and
non-revenue vehicles required for system operation and maintenance;
(e)  preparation of drawings on facilities design, including alignment/
layout,   structures,  highway  realignment/widening,   construction
sequence planning, right-of-way, utilities relocation; and
(f)  preparation of all necessary procurement documentation in accordance
with IDA guidelines.
7.        Urban Transport Studies.  The consultants will assist in preparation
of the following studies in Karachi:
(a)  Traffic Demand Management (including the establishment of an Urban
Transport Advisory Group).   The consultants will  (i) prepare an
analysis of Karachi urban transport issues, including planning,
coordination, bus fares, privatization, parking, fleet expansion, and
infrastructure  development  and  financing;  and  (ii)    develop  a
transport sector plan for Karachi based on options and strategies
developed in the analysis including, testing and development of
specific measures for differential fare pricing of transit routes,
priority assignment of buses at selected street locations, use of auto
free zones, traffic enforcement regulations, better traffic control,
and selection of spot improvements to facilitate bus operations.
(b)  Traffic  Engineering  Training.   The  consultants will  (i)  review
available traffic data and studies to determine severity, location,
and duration of traffic problems; and (ii) develop training schemes
for traffic management measures, such as junction improvements,
traffic signal synchronization schemes, and refinement of traffic
engineering standards.
(c)  Traffic Police Training.  The consultants will assist the implementing
agencies in training traffic police to effectively manage vehicular
flow and enforcement of traffic regulations.
(d)  Privatization Options Study.   The objective of this study is to
examine options for privatizing KTC operations. The scope of work of
the study involves:   (i) analyze origin-destination person trip
volumes in the city and select a corridor with heavy traffic volume



- 66 -
Annex 4
Page 9 of 10
as a pilot study; (ii) examine quality of transit service along the
corridor and estimate capital and operating expenses for meeting the
travel  demand  in  future;  (iii)    examine  different  options  for
financing the lease or purchase of buses and minibuses by private
operators; (iv) develop a deregulatory policy for fare structures that
will allow the operators a reasonable return on investment and explain
fare structure sensitivity to profit and loss statement for the
operators; (v) develop options for downsizing of KTC's oprations and
reduction of staff; and (vi) develop criteria and guidelines for
evaluation of the program.
8.        Policy and Institution Strengthening.  The consultants will:
(a) review GOS's policy initiatives and make recommendations to improve

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (KORANGI INDUSTRIAL AREA)
A. Backfround and Obiectives
1.        The Korangi Industrial Area is bounded on the south by the Korangi
creek and on the north by the Malir river, that discharges downstream in the
Korangi creek. Several major industrial plants and power stations are located
in this area which cause serious air and water pollution requiring immediate
solutions. Air pollution is mainly sulfur dioxide (estimated between 60,000 and
80,000 tpa), carbon dioxide emissions from the steel mills and open burning of
municipal waste, nitrogen oxides from combustion processes, and suspended
particulates emitted especially by the steel mills.  The water pollution and
solid waste disposal in this area is totally uncontrolled and is disastrous from
health and environmental points of view. The most serious polluter in this area
is the tanning industry (also an important source of foreign exchange), releasing
Biological Oxygen Demand, chromium, and sulfides in untreated effluent streams
which are drained in a channel that runs into the coastal mangrove area. Farmers
use effluent water from the nullah to irrigate their farms, producing vegetables
for the market which contain high amounts of chromium. The problem is compounded
as a number of industries are small and medium sized which are not in a financial
position to instal water treatment equipment or even maintain it.
2.        An environmental impact assessment of this entire area has now become
a necessity because (a) future cleaning up of the toxic effluents that drain into
city sewers and run off drains should not be attempted without better
understanding of the environmental implications; and (b) preparation of the
proposed Karachi Hydrocracker Project (FY94L) will require that an environmental
assessment be made of its impact to the surrounding vicinity, the Korangi
Industrial Area.

B.        Scope of Work
3.        The consultants will:
(a) prepare an in-depth study to make an inventory of water pollution and
solid waste disposal, identifying the sources of the polluting
materials and the quantities involved;
(b) identify specific measures that have to be taken to clean up the whole
area under study and the measures that have to be taken up for the
different groups of industries;
(c)  evaluate environmental impact of the proposed Karachi Hydrocracker
Project, including solid waste disposal and storage and handling of
sulfur production;
(d) identify measures required to rehabilitate the drainage systems in the
sector where tanning industries are located and to establish a
communal tannery effluent waste water pre-treatment;
(e) suggest measures to adequately handle processes for solid waste
treatment;
(f) identify effluent streams of different industries that could be
organized in communal treatment facilities;
(g)  develop pollution abatement standards for the Sindh Environmental
Protection Agency; and
(h) make recommendations for sustaining results in the future.

SINDH SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.        Annex 7 is divided into two parts, Part I "Description of Works to be
Financed" and Part II "Support for GOS's Policy Reform Program." Outline Terms
of References for technical assistance is in Annex 4.
DESCRItIYON OF WORUS TO BE FINANCEED
A. ENVEIRONMDENTAL UPGRASDING
Al. Storm Water Drainage: Korangi Nallah
2.        The objective of this sub-component is to improve the drainage system
in Karachi to prevent serious flooding and to minimize damage to roads, property,
and human lives. Karachi basin is drained directly into the sea by two major
rivers, Malir and Lyari, with catchment areas of 792 and 272 sq. miles
respectively. These rivers play an important role in the natural drainage of
Karachi.    The existing  storm water  drainage  facilities  in  the city  are
insufficient and even light rains cause damage to the communication, roads and
power system; heavy rains result in catastrophic consequences for the city with
flooding and serious environmental damage.
3.        One of the Karachi components (channelization of Korangi nallah) is
part of this large program of macro drainage and flood protection for the city
as a whole. The Korangi area has suffered colossal damages due to five major
floods in the past decade (four in the past seven years). The outfall reaches
of the Korangi nallah will be channelized so as not to cause obstruction to the
improved flow from their catchment areas. Channelization of the Korangi nallah
does not involve resettlement.
A2. Malir River Flood Protection Scheme Phase V
4.        During the past 23 years, catastrophic floods have been experienced
six times in Karachi caused by abnormal rainfall and river inundation. In 1977
alone, over 250 persons were drowned and 350 businesses put out of action. Since
1978, phased remedial works have been undertaken to construct earth bunds,
initially of a length of 5 miles in the early phases. Further works added nearly
8 more miles of bunds, as well as the channelization of Chakora Nallah, which
have now been completed. The next phase of redevelopment consisted of the re-
siting of a number of encroachments, nearly 9 miles of additional bunds, and the
completion of structures including culverts, bridges and a causeway, and general
strengthening which was completed in 1989. Phase V has as its objective, the
completion of the final phase of the works which will incorporate flood
protection to all residential and industrial areas along both banks of the river
from the National Highway to the estuary, with a population of about two million,
by means of (a) completion of earthen embankments for 6.05 miles, including (i)
construction of embankments from RD 17+000 to RD 27+000 and from RD 1+300 to RD



- 79 -
Annex 7
Page 2 of 6
8+300 along the left bank, and (ii) raising of embankment from RD 10+00 to RD
25+000 along the right bank; (b) the modification of eleven spurs along both
banks; (c) the channelization of the Pir Bukhari Nallah for a length of 3975 ft
and construction of 2 bridges and 6 drainage inlets; and (d) construction of
additional slope protection works and stone apron in a length of 2.27 miles along
the left bank and 4.1 miles along the right bank.
5.        Resettlement of seven farms, including six vegetable and one poultry
farms, are involved in this project. All the land involved is leased from the
Land Revenue Department of the Board of Revenue (55 acres are on a 99 year lease,
169 acres are on short term leases).   These leases will be cancelled and
appropriate compensation will be paid to the leaseholders.  Once the bund is
moved, it is possible that these farms can be re-established in front of the new
Bund  in the bed of the Malir,  or behind  the bund  in Korangi.    Present
leaseholders will be given first right to lease the plots again following
construction of the bund.
B. TRANSPORT IMPROVEMENTS
Bi. Two Bridl
6.        The objective of this sub-component is to improve traffic circulation
and related pollution and correct specific road bottlenecks by:
(a) Replacing a level crossing by constructing a railway overhead bridge
on University Road near Aziz Bhatti Park, Gulshan e Iqbal.   The
present level crossing is closed about 20 times per day and causes
heavy traffic pile-ups on what is an increasingly high volume arterial
road. The peculiarities of the location, the angle of intersection,
and other constraints eliminate alternative sites. The skew of the
permanent way in relation to University Road is 65 degrees, which
leads to the bridge and its approaches totalling over 850 meters in
length. The current volume of vehicular traffic passing this location
is about 60,000 per day.  Forecast volumes for years 2001 and 2011
amount to 116,000 and 195,000 respectively. The overhead bridge will
be eight-lane, 28.6 meters wide and 567.8 meter long, with a median
barrier of 0.6 meter. The bridge consists of 33 spans of 14 meters
and  6  spans  of  17.6 meters.    The  project will  also  include:
construction of diversion lanes parallel to University road (10 meter
wide), reconstruction of drains, upgradation of portions of existing
carriageway,   construction  of  two  pedestrian  staircases,   and
electrification of bridges, ramps, diversion, and merging lanes.
This project has minor resettlement--25 small businesses--of which 15
are in the open or constructed of non-permanent (katchi) materials.
None will have to be relocated.
(b) Bridge widening over the Lyari river on Rashid Minhas Road. Currently
this is a six-lane road which is reduced to four-lanes for the Lyari
crossing.  The recent development in the area on either end of the
bridge has generated considerable increased traffic demand in both
directions.   The average volume of vehicular traffic crossing the
bridge amounts to more than 76,000 daily and is forecast to increase



- 80 -
Annex 7
Page 3 of 6
to more than 120,000 by the year 2000. Increasing the bridge capacity
to an eight-lane structure is already a need, and capacity analysis
indicates that capacity would be reached by year 2005. The schematic
designs envisage either the symmetrical widening of the bridge and the
approaches or alternatively the addition of a new parallel structure
and approach on the western or downstream side.   The PC-1 study
examined the two alternatives and recommends all four new lanes be
constructed on the downstream side and abutting the existing bridge
with a gap of 50 mm between the two bridges. This preferred solution
reduces disruption during construction, limits land acquisition to one
side only, will be structurally simpler and provide better traffic
flow conditions than widening the existing structure symmetrically.
The additional piers will be aligned with those of the existing
structure, and displacement of current occupants limited to the
downstream side. The bridge will be about 118 meters long and 16.8
meters wide. The project will also include: installation of traffic
guide signs and signals, construction of engineer's office, demolition
of  authorized  and  unauthorized  structures  near  the  bridge,
reconstruction and rehabilitation of footpaths, roads, drains, etc.,
refurbishment of the existing bridge, remodeling of approach roads,
and carrying out leveling and grading of the river bed.
This project would require minor resettlement including, ten
habitations  and 51  small businesses.   About half  of the  small
businesses are one-man operations functioning in the open or a
temporary hutment (cabin). (Only one residence and one business will
be demolished.) The inhabitants of this residence are scavengers who
also occupy a substantial contiguous area for sorting recyclable
items, and can rebuild their house in part of this locale. A second
residence will lose only one wall and part of its yard.  The other
families living in the project area live in temporary,   moveable
hutments under the bridge.
B2. Traffic Management
7.        This  sub-component  will  improve  effectiveness  of  the  traffic
circulation system at 16 intersections in dealing with mounting traffic
congestion and road accidents in Karachi. Inadequate traffic control measures
at intersections result in significant delays, inefficient utilization of link
capacities, and are a major concern for safety. The specific focus will be on
executing works for junction improvements, road geometrics, design, intersection
control,  pavement  marking,  and  construction  bus  bays.    At  signalized
intersections, synchronized signal timing and phasing will be introduced, and at
rotaries and uncontrolled intersections, signals will be installed to control
conflicting movements of traffic. A pedestrian phase will be provided at most
of the approaches.
B3. Relocation and Expansion of Bus and Truck Tenninals in Interior Cities
8.        This sub-component includes relocation and expansion of bus terminals
in Larkana and Mirpurkhas and a truck terminal in Nawabshah.   The existing bus
terminal in Larkana is situated near People's Stadium in a low lying area with
acute drainage problem.  The insufficient water disposal system causes water



- 81 -
Annex 7
Page 4 of 6
stagnation especially during the rainy season, resulting in great inconvenience
to passengers.   In addition, the terminal lacks basic facilities,  such as
toilets, retiring rooms for drivers, and a waiting room for passengers.  The
proposed site for Larkana bus terminal, encompassing about 11 acres, is on the
northern edge of the town opposite the link road that connects Ratodero road to
Naudero road, the two principal roads which carry most of the regional bus
service load, and is about eleven acres. The bus terminal in Mirpurkhas also
lacks basic commuter facilities, and the existence of a railway level crossing
just on the outside of the terminal results in long delays during gate closure.
The bus parking and storage facilities are inadequate, which results in haphazard
parking and serious traffic management problems. The proposed site (about six
acres) for Mirpurkhas bus terminal is in the northeast of the city, along the
ring road.
9.        There is no proper truck terminal in Nawabshah at present in spite of
a heavy goods movement by roads, which results in haphazard parking of trucks and
trailers in the CBD. The main concentration is along Market road and Bankaram
road. It is proposed to relocate the truck stand on a site of about 8 acres on
the eastern side of the city on the Link road connecting two major regional
roads.
10.       There is no resettlement involved in any of the selected sites.  The
site in Nawabshah is designated as agricultural but no agricultural activity is
being pursued.   In Mirpurkhas, the designated site (about 6 acres) in the
northeast of the city has a mangoe orchard. In Larkana, the proposed site (about
11 acres) is presently vacant land.   In all three cases, the land is under
individual ownership, and the owners have indicated their willing to sell the
land.
C. FISCAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM
Cl. Property Tax Reform
11.       Property tax reform is expected to increase revenues for both local
governments and the province.   It will commence with the proposed project,
initially focusing on Karachi, and will expand to other cities in the subsequent
projects.   The property tax reform in Karachi will be addressed through a
possible increase in rates, updating of the property tax list (from about 450,000
to 900,000 properties using the list from KWSB), reduction of exemptions for
favorable treatment for owner-occupiers, revaluation and improved collection
performance, revision of land-use and building regulations for Karachi as
required, selling of land at market prices, and establishment of institutional
arrangements to monitor tax policies for economic and financial impacts on
households and firms in Sindh. Specialists will provide advice and assistance
for policy reform and accompanying legislation, improvements in internal
administrative systems and procedures, computerization, and training. Modern
valuation techniques will be introduced, and a comprehensive training program in
valuation will be conducted for GOS. The possibility of changing the basis for
valuation assessment from annual rental value to capital value will be assessed.
Revaluation combined with reduction of exemptions and improved collections is
expected to increase the property tax yield in Karachi between 100 and 300
percent by the third year of the project. Upgrading of the property list and

revaluation of properties are expected to increase the yield 400 to 600 percent
by the end of the project.
C2. Investment Planning and Budfetinf
12.       The objective of this sub-component is to improve appraisal criteria
and to develop an integrated capacity in the four core departments of GOS
(Planning & Development, Finance, Board of Revenue, and Excise & Taxation) to
undertake improvements in investment planning, programming, budgeting, financing,
supervision, and monitoring.   The Planning & Development Department will be
strengthened with a focus on: (i) investment planning and budgeting, including
evaluation of existing projects and termination of low-priority investments; and
(ii) the use of improved appraisal, budgetary and planning procedures in the
other three departments to include a three-year budget.   To support similar
improvements in investment planning and finance at the local government level,
the GOS will establish the basis for mutual planning and programming for
financial and technical assistance and provide management assistance and training
to local governments.
C3. Financial Manaement
13.       This sub-component will establish institutional machinery to identify
and implement strategies for deficit reduction, containment of low-priority
recurrent expenditures, and increased revenue generation.   Activities will
include determination of manpower strength, identification of redundant manpower,
computerization of payroll systems, development of measures to contain growth in
recurrent expenditures, and other measures to reduce or contain expenditures;
specialist assistance in strengthening of financial accounting, monitoring, and
reporting systems and procedures; standardizing provincial and local government
accounting practices; establishing financial forecasting procedures; and general
strengthening of financial administration in GOS.
D. INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING
Dl. KDA
14.       KDA's dominance of the land market in Karachi, its lack of political
accountability, and increasing financial problems have prompted it to prepare a
Corporate Development Plan (CDP) including short term (3 year) measures to rescue
its financial decline and medium term (5 year) strategies to implement basic
changes in its role and mandate, eventually to assume a better focused role in
land development for the low-income population. Specialist assistance will be
provided to assist KDA in implementing these measures, which will involve
revision of the Sindh Land Disposal Ordinance to remove discretionary powers of
GOS and to provide for pricing of land at market value; reforming and
implementing the non-utilization fee policy for vacant land; implementing a
policy of in-filling in Karachi and a strategy for better utilization of surplus
government lands; modernizing land record systems and procedures; reorientation
of KDA's mandate toward low income shelter in Karachi; and restructuring of its
governing body to allow greater private sector representation and political
accountability.   KDA has already formulated plans and initiated actions to
redress its financial problems, including reduction of subsidies in housing

development, computerization of its land records and accounting systems, and
estimation of redundant manpower with the objective of strengthening its overall
operations. This sub-component will also include assistance in revision of the
accounting system in KDA, with particular attention to internal financial control
and reporting procedures.
D2. KMC
15.       The shift in political power in favor of urban constituencies and
devolution of certain administrative and financial functions to KMC by the
provincial government have placed increased management responsibilities on KMC,
requiring it to perform more fully as a metropolitan government.   While its
economic resources have been significantly enhanced over the past several years,
its organizational and management structures are not consonant with its increased
responsibility and evolving role.  The objective of this sub-component is to
modernize the operations of KMC to undertake enhanced metropolitan government
functions and improve its capacity in providing and expanding services. Broad
institutional reform will be required, encompassing legal changes to allow
greater autonomy and eventual responsibility for property tax administration in
Karachi, computerized records management operations, training of senior and
middle level staff, and modernization of its planning, budgetary, and decision
making systems.  A twinning arrangement with Birmingham City Council from the
U.K. is being considered to assist KMC in developing corporate plans and
personnel policies necessary for becoming a well managed metropolitan body. KMC
has on its own prepared a proposal for institutional strengthening following the
model of the program in KWSB.

SINDH SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
GOS' Fiscal Alternatives and Assumptions Used
A. Financial Analysis
1.        Possible future finances of the GOS can be illustrated by looking at:
(a)  cash balance utilization: the "bottom line" for the finances of GOS;
(b) current surpluses and deficits: the savings of GOS and the limiting
factor on investment levels over time;
(c)  current expenditures on services (including administrative costs): the
potential amount available for delivery of services to the population;
(d) development expenditures: the public investment of Sindh;
(e) interest payments as a percentage of current revenues: a measure of
the burden of debt; and
(f) long-term debt outstanding as a percentage of national GDP: a measure
of the sustainability of deficit spending.
2.        Table A shows past, present, and projected financial parameters for
the GOS.  All Rupee figures in the table are at 1991-1992 prices.  The first
column of the table shows average financial figures for the six years 1986
through 1991.   This column summarizes the discussion above of GOS's recent
financial performance. The second column shows GOS's performance in 1992, and
some of the deterioration in the GOS's financial position.
3.        The third column shows projected financial values if the GOS does not
institute financial reform. If revenue components and expenditure items maintain
their historical paths, the GOS will be unable to finance development without
growing use of cash balances at the State Bank of Pakistan. By 1998, the GOS
would need to draw down its cash balances by about Rs 14.5 billion. As GOS is
not in a position to make such cash withdrawals, the table incorporates a
projection in which cash balance utilization after 1993 will be nil.
4.        Column three shows also that, even without financial reform, current
expenditures on services and administration will continue to grow and interest
payments as a percentage of current revenues will not exceed historical levels.
However, the GOS will find development expenditures dwindling in the 1990s, as
development funds are diverted to meet current needs. In addition, the GOS's
deficits will grow to 28.2% of current revenues. These projections illustrate
the need for financial reform.

5.            As  part  of  the  SSDP  reforms,  IDA  and  the  GOS  have  examined  several
different reform packages, including both moderate and extensive revenue
increases, both current expenditure and borrowing restraints, and combinations
thereof. The most promising single provincial revenue source is the motor vehicle
tax, and the best means of increasing urban revenues in the province is the urban



- 88 -
Annex 10
Page 3 of 6
immovable property tax.   The SSDP therefore includes provisions to increase
revenues  collected  from  these  taxes.'   However,  analysis  indicates  that
available steps to reduce expenditures are likely to be more effective than
available revenue generation measures.   During negotiations, postponement of
implementation of the extensive revenue increases, and adoption of policies to
focus on increasing motor vehicle and property taxes and restrain expenditures
instead will be discussed with GOS.2
6.        The most promising expenditure policy would require GOS to reduce the
growth rate of current expenditures (excluding interest payments and subsidies)
in each year to the rate that current receipts grew in the previous year. For
example, if current revenues last year were 10% higher than they were the year
before, current expenditures this year could be no more than 10% higher than they
were last year.
7.        Column four of Table A shows the projected effects of instituting
moderate revenue increases and current expenditure restraint.   These reforms
offer opportunities to achieve several improvements. Comparison of the last two
columns of Table A shows the projected effects of reform, including:
(a) projected deficits decline to 9.0% from 28.2% of revenues without
reform;
(b) projected real per capita development spending increases from Rs 53
to Rs 188 on average for the next six years; and
(c) projected real expenditures per capita on services and administration
remain almost as high as they would be in the absence of reform.
1/    Recent studies show that a ten-fold increase in property tax yield is a
conservative estimate, as rates have been unchanged for 20 years. GOS
retains more than 15% of property tax collections, with the remainder
distributed to local governments. With revaluation, a 1,000% increase
in the tax would increase retained tax receipts from Rs. 35 million in
1990/91 to Rs. 350 million by 1996/97, assuming there is no change in
the relative proportions between GOS and local government. (At least a
700% increase would be required to overtake inflation since 1968.) A
change in the motor vehicle tax rate to 1.0% ad valorem would increase
revenues on cars and trucks from Rs 284 million in 1989/90 to Rs 1.24
billion in 1996/97.
2/    GOS is pursuing the possibility of levying a surcharge on GOP taxes
generated from income and sales in the province as a way of gaining
access to tax revenue sources which are buoyant. These sources are not
expected to yield any additional (above the amounts for property and
motor vehicle taxes) revenues within the next two years. The other tax
sources that are available to the GOS are generally problematic; either
they are not sufficiently buoyant or they are not fiscally sound. The
proposed project would therefore focus on sources which have a direct
impact on the financing of urban infrastructure and/or services in the
province.

Annex 10

8.        The recommended reforms are likely to be more beneficial than the
projections can show.  By continuing (reduced) deficit spending, the reforms
allow for fiscal stimulus to Sindh's economy that the financial model does not
capture.   In addition,  the continued development expenditure can lead to
increased capital formation that increases the productive capacity of the
province, another potential effect that the model omits.   (Part B contains a
discussion of the assumptions behind the projections and their implications.)
Both of these effects will increase revenues above their projected levels. In
the absence of reform, without investment, productive capacity is likely to
dwindle, and the stimulus from the enormous budget deficits is in danger of being
translated into inflation, not economic growth.
9.        At the same time, the SSDP reforms will not solve all of GOS's
problems. Deficits, though lower than without the reforms, will persist. The
ratio of the GOS's debt to projected GDP will be unaffected. Further efforts
will be necessary to address these problems.  For example, there is room for
improvement in the GOS's financial performance. The GOS will probably have to
borrow all ADP funds for the next decade, at least.  With debt service pre-
empting an increasing share of GOS budgets, it is imperative that the GOS either
reduce the real rates it pays for cash development loans to finance the ADP or
increase the return on investments financed through the ADP, or both.
10.       Given the added complexity and the uncertainties attending financial
reform, the GOS and IDA have agreed to begin with slowing the growth rate of
current expenditures on services and administration.   Durina negotiations.
restriction of the growth rate of current expenditures (net of interest payments)
in each year to the growth rate of current revenues attained in the previous year
will be discussed with GOS.
11.       In  addition  to  the  revenue  enhancement  measures  (         5)  and
expenditure restraint steps recommended above, the GOS has the opportunity to
take additional steps that will strengthen its finances. These fundamental
reforms are necessary to avoid a disappearance of public investment and decline
in funds available for current expenditure. These include:
(a) work with GOP to reform intergovernmental finance;
(b) improve collection efforts for both taxes and fees;
(c) cut subsidies to local governments and other entities;
(d) implement investment planning and monitoring; and
(e) increase the effectiveness of current spending.

B. Assumptions Used in the Financial Projections
B1. Analytical Assumpfions
1. Cost and revenue items follow historical growth paths estimated by
AERC
a. Some items grow with time
b. Most federal transfers, and Cash Development Loans, grow with the
size of the national economy
c. Some items grow with the size of the provincial economy
d. current expenditures on education and health grow with economic
growth and with the size of previous investments in the sectors
2. Public infrastructure investments have zero financial return
3. There are no economic feedback loops
a. No fiscal stimulus from deficit spending
b. No growth stimulus from increased capacity due to public investment
(i.e., investment has zero economic return, as well as zero
financial return).
4. Public investments do not increase future O&M costs
5. Reclassify (from system used by GOS):
a. State trading as current activity, not capital
b. Extraordinary receipts as capital receipts, not current receipts
6. Zero net losses and gains for state trading activities (so the
reclassification in 5. above matters only for historical series).
B2. Policy & Behavioral Assumptions
1. GOS taps no other sources of borrowing (beyond SSDP and CDL)
a. No borrowing from GOS's own departments
b. No borrowing from the public account (future net public account
receipts are zero)
c. No more federal non-development loans
d. No more drawing down cash balances at the State Bank of Pakistan
2. GOS meets demands for payment in the following order of priority: (1)
interest on debt; (2) principal on debt; (3) current expenditures; and
(4) development needs.
3. GOS does not replenish cash balances with the State Bank of Pakistan,
or repay money "borrowed" from the Public Account of the province.
B3. Assumptions about the Economic Enviromnent
1.  Inflation follows World Bank forecasts (8% next year, 6% thereafter).



- 91 -
Annex 10
Page 6 of 6
2. National real economic growth follows World Bank forecasts.
3. Sindh economic growth as projected by AERC, slightly above national.

SINDH SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ECONOMIC ROR CALCULATIONS
Economic Rate of Return for Bridge Expansion over Lvari River
1.        The economic rate of return  (ERR)  was computed for this project
considering 1994 and 1995 as the construction period and maintenance starting in
1996 at 1% of the capital cost. The benefits are measured in terms of savings
in vehicle operating costs. The life of pavement is assumed to be 20 years; and
of structures to be 100 years. A salvage value has been assigned to the project
at the end of the analysis period. The expansion of the bridge would result in
traffic diversion from adjoining links to save travel time, which has not been
included in the calculation of net benefits.
2.        Vehicle Operating Costs.  For deriving vehicle user costs, operating
speeds of four basic categories of vehicles (cars, minibuses, buses, and trucks)
were forecast both in the "without project" and "with project" scenarios. For
obtaining operating speed, the average operating speed relative to volume-
capacity (V-C) ratio were factored by the relationship of average car speed to
the average speed of other vehicles in Karachi.  For cars, the average speed
range from about 60kph in 1996 to 30 kph in 2016 "with project", and 35kph in
1996 to 15kph in 2016 "without project."  The corresponding average speed ranges
for buses are 5okph to 25kph "with" and 30kph to 15kph  "without."   For
determining vehicle operating costs above 30kph, the NTRC publication "Vehicle
Operating Costs"  (1985)  is used.   The vehic]e operating costs below 3okph
(prevalent on urban arterials) have been derived from extrapolation of the
physical factors contained in the NTRC publication. For purposes of estimating
the VOC, the effective length of the bridge has been taken as 1120 meters (120
meters bridge length and two 500 meters approach roads on both sides) .  The
difference between vehicle operating costs before and after the project (vehicle
operating costs savings) ranges between about Rs 9 million in 1996 and Rs 54
million in 2016.
3.        Traffic Volume Data.    The existing  data  related to  traffic  is
available in the form of traffic counts by Karachi Mass Transit Study (KMTS),
vehicles registration available from the excise and taxation department, and the
monthly fuel sales data from Oil Companies Advisory Committee  (OCAC) .  In
addition, traffic counts were conducted near the proposed parallel bridge site
on Rashid Minhas road and Abul-Hasan-Isphahani road in January, 1993 to manually
record hourly traffic volumes by direction for different vehicle categories.  The
traffic growth factors were developed by using: (a) growth rate of vehicle
registration; (b) population; and (c) Gross Domestic Product over the period 1987
to 1993.
4.        Estimates of Diverted Traffic.  The completion of the proposed bridge
extension would also result in redistribution of traffic patterns.   A link
directly affected would be the Abul Hasan Isphahani road, which at present serves
as an alternate route for trips to and from Gulshan-e-Iqbal/University road.
Conservative estimates indicate that at least one-third of the traffic volumes



- 94 -
Annex 12
Page 2 of 4
during the morning and afternoon peak periods on this road would get diverted to
the Rashid Minhas road following the completion of the project.
5.        Economic Rates of Return.   The net present value  (NPV)  and the
economic rate of return (ERR) were computed over the life of the project (20
years). The net present value is estimated at Rs 81 million (at 12% discount
rate) and the ERR at 26%.
6.         Sensitivity  Analysis.    A  sensitivity  anlysis  indicates  that  an
increase in construction costs of 20% would reduce the NPV to about Rs 72 million
and the ERR to about 21%. A 20% decrease in savings from vehicle operating costs
would have a similar effect on the NPV and ERR.
Economic Rate of Return for
University Road Overhead Bridge Construction
7.        The economic rate of return  (ERR)  was computed for this project
considering 1994, 1995, and 1996 as the construction period and maintenance
starting in 1997 at 1% of the capital cost. The life of pavement is assumed to
be 20 years; and of structures to be 100 years.   The residual value for the
project has been taken as 50% for road works and 90% for structures.   The
benefits are measured in terms of reduction in vehicle operating costs and
passenger travel time.
8.        Vehicle Operating Costs.   As in the case of bridge expansion over
Lyari river, vehicle operating costs above 30 kph were determined using the NTRC
publication for each of the different vehicle types.
9.        Traffic Volume Data.  The average daily traffic (ADT) was collected
at the university level crossing for each of the vehicle types in 1992. The
traffic growth factors were developed by using:   (a) growth rate of vehicle
registration; (b) population; and (c) Gross Domestic Product.
10.       Savings in Passenger Travel Time.   On average, the existing level
crossing is closed daily about 20 times for almost 10 to 15 minutes each time,
resulting in average delay per vehicle of about 7.5 minutes.  In the absence of
the proposed overhead bridge, the delay is expected to increase in future with
an increase in traffic volume, but for purposes of this analysis the delay is not
expected to change from 7.5 minutes.
11.       Traffic Management During Construction. There are no alternative roads
available to divert the traffic during construction. It is, therefore, proposed
to construct diversion roads of three lanes on each side of the proposed overhead
bridge, on land presently occupied by service roads and reservations. After the
bridge construction,  the land will be restored to its present shape.   The
resulting increase in cost and travel time are expressed as negative benefits in
the economic evaluation of the "with project" scenario.
12.       Economic Rates of Return.   The net present value  (NPV)  and the
economic rate of return (ERR) were computed over the life of the project (20
years). The net present value is estimated at Rs 310 million (at 12% discount
rate) and the ERR at 34%.

Annex 12
Page 3 of 4
13.       Sensitivity Analysis.    A  sensitivity  anlysis  indicates  that  an
increase in construction costs of 20% would reduce the NPV to about Rs 280
million and the ERR to about 28%.   A 20% decrease in savings from vehicle
operating costs would have a similar effect on the NPV and ERR.
Economic Rate of Return for Traffic Manaeement
14.       The economic rate of return  (ERR)  was computed for this project
considering savings from reduction in vehicle operating costs (fuel consumption,
lubricants, tires, parts, maintenance, labor) and passenger travel time. S3mig
have been derived as a consequence of reduction in running times and stopped-time
delays encountered as a result of congestion and bottlenecks.
15.       Vehicle Operating Costs.  As in the case of the two bridges, vehicle
operating costs above 30 kph were determined using the NTRC publication for each
of the different vehicle types.  The weighted average VOCs for each intersection
were computed with different congestion factors applied according to the level
of congestion with and without the project.
16.       Passenger Time Cost Savings.   The savings in passenger time was
calculated with and without the project for each of the proposed intersections.
The average vehicle occupancy was used to compute the savings in time for each
vehicle type, from which net savings for all vehicles over an year was
calculated.
17.       Capacity  Analysis.    Capacity  analysis  was  conducted  for  each
intersection using 1993 traffic volumes in order to determine the impact of
geometric improvements. The controlling parameters were demand/capacity ratio,
geometric delays, and queuing delays. Geometric delay was computed as the sum
of three components: a) time lost decelerating and accelerating; b) time lost due
to slower speeds through a junction; and c) time lost due to longer distances
through the junction. Queuing delay for each of the entering traffic streams
depends mainly upon the ratio of arrival rate of traffic to the prevailing
entering capacity.   Peak hour flows for each of the turning movements at
intersections were estimated. Recommendations were determined for each of the
warrant criteria, including minimum vehicular volume, interruption of continuous
traffic, minimum pedestrian volume, school crossing, progressive movement, and
accident experience.
18.       Economic Rate of Return.   Of the total savings, vehicle operating
costs result in a savings of about 65% and passenger time cost savings accounting
for the remaining 35%.  The net present value (NPV) and the economic rate of
return (ERR) were computed for each of the proposed intersection improvements by
discounting costs and benefits over a period of 10 years. No residual values
were assumed for improvements at the end of the 10 year period. The weighted ERR
for all intersection improvements is 24.8%.
19.       Sensitivity Analysis.    A  sensitivity  anlysis  indicates  that  an
increase in construction costs of 20% would reduce the ERR to about 21%. A 20%
decrease in savings from vehicle operating costs would have a similar effect on
the ERR.

Nonguantifiable Benefits
20.       Each of the urban transportation projects, two bridges and traffic
management schemes, would result in substantial benefits which have not been
included in the economic rate of return calculations. Vehicle idling would be
reduced at the railway level crossing and traffic intersections resulting in
reduced emissions; traffic flow would be better organized through the
implementation of signal control at intersections and roundabouts which would
result in accident prevention and safer driving conditions. Improvements to road
geometrics and pavement markings would reduce conflict among different vehicle
types and between vehicles and pedestrians. The proposed project would therefore
result in improved living conditions and a better urban environment.
