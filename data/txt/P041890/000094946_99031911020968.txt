3. ENGINEERING ANALYSIS
3.1 Composition of Public Vehicles and Maintenance Capacity
The public transportation in Shenyang is composed mainly of public buses and trams,
supplemented by joint-operation buses and mini buses. Currently, there are 15 public
transportation lines, with a total length of 2316 km and annual load of more than 486 million
person-times. There are total 3283 vehicles in Shenyang Passenger Transit Group, including
2339 normal buses, and 944 buses in the joint-operation company and the long-distance
passenger transportation company.
At present, all the public transportation vehicles are maintained by 8 repair depots (also as
parking lots), with a total area of 207,000 mi2. Due to inadequate space and obsolete
equipment, the maintenance capacity of these 8 depots is only 61% of what they should have.
Because there is no depot specifically designed for major repair and medium maintenance,
only 20 - 30% of the vehicles that need repair were repaired, while other 70 - 80% can not be
recovered, which resulting in decrease of vehicle performance. In 1997, only 300 vehicles
received major repair and medium maintenance. As the public transportation develops, this
situation will be more serious.
3.2 Prediction of Maintenance Capacity and its Future Progress
It is planned that by 2010, an increase of 1,469 vehicles will be achieved by Shenyang
Passenger Transit Group. The demand for major repair and medium maintenance in 2003 is
1,010 vehicles, and in 2010 is 1,324 vehicles.
According to the maintenance capability and demand, planning was made by the Group. The
construction of this project, together with other measures, is expected to able to balance the
demand and actual maintenance capacity by 2010 or more longer.
3.3 Construction Option
In order to achieve objectives above, the Group planned to construct a new repair facility
particularly for major repair and medium maintenance in Xiaohantuan Village, Northwest
Shenyang City in three years, with capacity mentioned in section 2.5 of this report.
3.4 Analysis of Pollution Emission
The major repair of whole vehicle consists of major repair of body, engine and chassis.
3.4.1 Major Repair of Vehicle Body
Pollution generated during major repair of vehicle body includes waste washing water
containing oil, SS and COD; waste gas fiom paint-spraying and baking process containing
benzene, nmethyl benzene and xylene; as well as CO, CO2 generated in welding. There is also
some solid waste generated such as those useless parts.

Pollution generated during major repair of engine includes waste washing water containing
oil, SS and COD; metal debris and noise from parts processing and repair; and waste gas from
erngine test containing NOx, CO and HC; waste gas from paint spraying and baking process
containing benzene; and some waste metal such as those useless parts.
3.4.3 Major Repair of Chassis
Pollution generated dwring major repair of chassis includes waste washing water containing
oil, SS and COD; waste gas from paint spraying and baking process containing benzene; and
some useless parts ( rrAnly waste metal).
3.4.4 Other Pollution Sources
Other pollution sources are:
(1). Auxiliary workshop: waste water of battery cell containing acid, SS and COD; waste
metal debris from mechanical treatment and punching shear process; noise and waste water
containing oil, SS and COD from mechanical treatment.
(2). Auxiliary facilities: noise pollution from air compressor station; smoke containing SO2
and dust from boiler combustion; water discharge from water-softening and boiler containing
SS and COD; solid residue from boiler combustion; and noise from air blower, compressor
and pumping station.
(3). Domestic sewage: sewage containing oil, SS and COD.
3.5 Pollution Factors and Environmental Elements
According to the above pollution analysis, the pollution factors to be assessed in this report
are defined as follows: benzene (also methyl benzene and xylene), NOx, CO, HC, SO2,
smoke dust, oil, COD, slag, waste metal, non-metal waste and noise.
The relevant environmental elements are defined as: ambient air, surface water, ground water
and residential area.
3.6 Prediction of Pollution Emission Load
3.6.1 Emission Load of Air Pollutants
The main air pollutants in the project are: benzene, methyl benzene and xylene from paint-
spraying, NOx, CO and HC from engine test and SO2 from boiler emission.

production process. The concentrations of oil, SS and CODcr exceed the standards (DB21-
60-89). The pollutants mainly come from the production waste water.
Physi-chemical method is proposed to be used to treat the waste water from production. The
recycle rate will be 70%. Provided the removal rate of the treatment system is 80%, the
pollutants discharge load and reduction are calculated and presented in Table 6-1. The waste
water discharge after treatment of the proposed facility is shown in Table 6-2.

The pollutant concentrations of the mixed waste water discharge are under the standards after
the treatment of production waste water.
A new North Waste Water Treatment Plant of Shenyang City will be put into operation in
August 1998, which is 4.25 km near the proposed facility. When the facility opens in
September 1999, the waste water discharge from the facility will be treated by the plant.
6.3 Ground Water
The floor of the workshop shall be treated to resist oil and acid. Waste water will be treatment
and discharges into municipal drainage network, hence representing no impact on ground
water in the projecqarea.
6.4 Solid Waste
Solid wastes generated in the facility include 250 t/a of waste metal parts, debris and
materials; and 100 t/a of waste materials. These will be recycled and sold out. The boiler slag
(1080 t/a) will be used for road construction.
6.5 Noise Impact
All noisy equipment shall be installed within workshops, with anti-vibration and closure
measures adopted. The maximum noise level is 85 dB in the boiler house and air compressor
house. The noise level at 1.0 m outside the workshop is 65 dB. Because the boiler house and
air compressor house are located in the north-west and the north of the facility, 65 dB can be
considered as the maximum noise level within the facility, which is under the standard (70dB
in day time, GB 12348-90 TV).
The nearest residential area of Beibajiazi is located in lkm north of the facility. After
decreased by 5 dB, according to calculation, the noise level in the residential area is lower
than the standard.
Liangma Villa is newly built in 500 m south-west of the facility. The noise level will be 11
dB there, with no impact on environmnent.

7.  Mitigation Measures
7.1 Air Pollution
7.1.1 Mitigation Measures for Paint-spraying Exhaust
(1). Use paint-spraying and baking cell to purify exhaust
It is proposed to adopt ZD-701-CHI Vehicle Paint-spraying and Baking Cell in the proposed
facility. The structure.of the cell and its working process is illustrated in Figure 7-1.
Figure 7-1 Structure of Paint-spraying & Baking Cell
6     5     4      3     2      l
1. Primary filtration; 2. Air blower; 3. Heat exchange system; 4. High efficiency fine filtration; 5. Bottom
filtration; 6. Exhaust exit; 7. Waste gas treatment system.
By using such cells, air exchange amount can be 2,000 m3 per hour, cleaning more than 98%
of pollutants of benzene series. The emission concentration of benzene is 6.6 mg/m3, lower
than the standard (GB 16297-96, benzene concentration: 12 mg/m3).
(2). Select new paint to reduce pollution load
A kind of new high-efficiency paint diluent will be used in the facility. It is composed of
several high-efficiency organic solvent with no benzene containing and non-hazardous.
Currently it has been broadly utilized in many large vehicle manufacturers. By using such a
diluent, emission of benzene can be reduced by 21.15 t/a, hence pollution be greatly reduced.
7.1.2- Mitigation Measures for Boiler Smoke
The maximum coal consumption of the boilers in the proposed facility is 2,134 kg/h during
winter time. The smoke will be cleaned by using dust removal facilities before emitted to
environment. In order to meet the standard of 250 mg/rn' ( Class 2 of Air Pollutants Emission
Standard for Boilers), the dust removal efficiency must be higher than 93%, hence, wet
collectors will be adopted. After treatment, the concentration of dust in the smoke is 180
mg/rn3, and S02 is 853 mg/3, which are lower than the standard.
21



Liaoning Urban Transport Project-Shenyang Subproject   Annex A: EIA of Shenyang Bus Repair Facility
7.2 Water Pollution
7.2.1 Separation of Clean Water and Sewage
The main pollution load comes from the waste water of production process, accounting for
96% of oil, 77% of SS and 83% of COD of the total load of the facility. Therefore, it will be
separated to be treated.
Totally about 232.17 tons of water will be used by production process every day. While only
0.01 t/a is used for battery cell washing. Because it contains H2SO4, it shall be separately
treated. Other oil-containing waste water will be concentrated for separate treatment.
k
7.2.2 Waste Water Treatment
Following treatment process is designed for oil-containing waste water and battery cell
washing water, as illustrated in Figure 7-2 and Figure 7-3.

After treatment, more than 80% of oil, SS and COD can be removed. The effluent, which
contains 5.4 mg/l of oil, 26 mg/I of SS and 22 mg/l of COD, can meet the discharge standard
(8 mg/l of oil, 100 mg/l of SS and 100 mg/l of COD) and can be reused, saving fresh water by
162 t/d.
7.3 Solid Waste
During the operation of the facility, the annual discharge of waste metal parts will be 200
tons, waste metal debris will be 50 tons and otlher waste materials will be more than 100 tons.
22



Liaoning Urban Transport Project-Shenyang Subproject Annex A: EIA of Shenyang Bus Repair Facility
All these will be recovered and sold out. More than 1,080 t/a of boiler slag can be used for
road construction or as other construction material.
7.4 Noise
The major noise sources are mechanical processing equipment, air compressor and blowers.
In order to achieve standard-compliance noise level within the project boundary and protect
the workers, low noise equipment shall be selected, and anti-vibration and sound-proof
measures be adopted. Therefore, the noise level can meet the standard of Class 4 of
GB 12348-90 (day: 70 dB, night: 55 dB)
7.5 Green Spate
It is recommended to plant flowers, trees and grass around buildings and roads to prevent
dust, absorb noise and beautify the environment.
7.6 Resettlement
In the project, no resettlement will occur.

Liaoning Urban Transport Project-Shenyang Subproject  Annex A: EIA of Shenyang Bus Repair Facility
8. ALTERNATIVE MITIGATION MEASURES
8.1 Oil Containing Waste Water
Floatation measure is adopted for the oil containing waste water treatment. FJ Floatation
Facility is recommended, which is made by Shenyang Special Environmental Protection
Facility Ltd. The oil removal rate is 94-98%, SS is 84-98%, COD is 80%. The oil discharge
concentration will be 5.4 mg/I, SS will be 26 mg/l and COD will be 22 mg/I, under the
standards (oil: 8 mg/I, SS: 100 mg/I, COD: 100 mg/I).
8.2 Paint-spraying Exhaust
Four alternatives are considered for the cleaning of paint-spraying tail gas. Based on the
specific situation, simple catalytic combustion will be selected.

9. TOTAL POLLUTANT LOAD CONTROL PLAN
9.1   Parameters of Pollutant Load Control
Benzene, dust, SO2, oil and CODcr are selected as the parameters for pollutant load control.
9.2 Principle of Pollutant Load Control
The principle of pollutant load control of this project is that the total pollutants mentioned
above discharged by Shenyang Passenger Transit Group (and within regional environment)
will be reduced due to. the new facility.
9.3 Pollutant Load Control Measures
9.3.1 Pollutants Emission of the Facility
Table 9-1 shows the pollutants emission during operation of the proposed facility.

9.3.2 Pollutant Load Analysis
At present, there is no maintenance depot specially designed for major repair and medium
maintenance of buses in Shenyang. In the past, these services were provided by 8 existing
maintenance depots. In 1997, only 300 vehicles received major repair and medium
maintenance, which is 30% of the capacity of the new facility. By the project completion, all
major repair and medium maintenance of public vehicles will be done in the new facility.
Due to their small sites and poor equipment, pollutants of the existing depots were discharged
into environment directly without treatment. The total emission of benzene of these 8 depots
is 9,165 kg/a ( 48 times as that of new repair facility ), oil and CODcr in production waste
water is 673 kg/a and 2,743 kg/a respectively ( ca. 6.2 times as that of the new facility).
Meanwhile, use of large capacity boilers and high-efficiency dust collectors will further
reduce emission of S02 and dust.
Therefore, the project will increase pollution in the project site, while reduce air and water
pollution in the area of Shenyang.
9.3.3 Pollutant Load Control Measures
(1). The waste water from the facility will be intercepted and sent into the North MLnicipal
Waste Water Treatment Plant of Shenyang for further treatment.
(2). Shenyang Passenger Transit Group plans to re-arrange the assignment of the existing 8
depots to reduce pollutioni within Shenyang city.

10.2 Environmental and Economic Benefit Analysis
By investing more than 4 million RMB on environmental protection measures, the overall
environmental of Shenyang will benefit from it. Although the pollution load in the project
area will increase due to the project, however, this will be controlled within requirement of
relevant standards by adopting mitigation measures mentioned above.

Liaoning Urban Transport Project-Shenyang Subproject  Annex A: EIA of Shenyang Bus Repair Facility
12. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Representatives of the People's Congress of Yuhong District, where the project is located in,
were invited by the construction unit and environmental authorities for their opinion on the
project. Public meetings were held in four villages around the project site for public
comments. Meanwhile, Inquiry Forms were disseminated to government agencies, schools, a
scientific institute. During this stage, a total number of 120 people were involved, covering
governmental officials, intellectuals, industrial workers, farmers and students.
Since the constructi.on of a new facility will improve the operation of existing public
transportation, hence-promote development of urban construction and economy. Therefore,
the project is supported by the public investigated. For pollution caused by the project, such
as waste gas containing benzene, methyl benzene and xylene and water containing oil, etc., it
is expected by the public that proper measure should be taken to minimize this pollution.
The public opinion was collected and reported to relevant authorities. Effective measures will
be adopted with full consideration of public opinion.

Liaoning Urban Transport Project-Shenyang Subproject  Annex A: EIA of Shenyang Bus Repair Facility
13. CONCLUSION
(1). The waste water discharge of the facility is 119 t/d, mainly from production process
containing oil, SS and COD. The production waste water (with battery washing water) will be
separated from domestic sewage for treatment, and about 70% of this effluent can be reused,
while the other 30% will mix with domestic sewage and be discharged within the sewage
discharge standard of Liaoning (DB21-60-89, industrial enterprise discharge standard).
(2). Floatation filtration will be adopted in this project to treat waste water containing oil, SS
and CODcr, with efficiency of more than 80%.
(3). Currently the xkste water of the project is discharged into North Canal via municipal
drainage system. By the time the facility is put into operation, the North Waste Water
Treatment Plant of Shenyang City will also be finished. Then, the waste water of the facility
will be intercepted into the treatment plant, hence, presenting no impact on surface and
ground water.
(4). The paint-spraying and baking cell is designed for reduce pollution of paint fog and
pollutants of benzene series, with a high removal rate of 98%. Meanwhile, adoption of non-
hazardous high-efficiency diluent containing no benzene will further reduce pollutants
emission. The concentrations of various pollutants in the emission are lower than the standard
value (GB 16297-1996), with little environmental impact.
(5). Waste gas from engine test contains lower concentration of NOx, CO and HC than the
emission standard and will be emitted directly into the air.
(6). For boilers with annual coal consumption of 5,000 tons, dust removal facility will be used
to reduce the emission of S02 and dust to 853 mg/m3 and 180 mg/mi3 respectively, which are
lower than Class 2 of GB13271-91. In order to keep the emission in compliance with
standard, the efficiency of the dust collector shall be more than 93%, and the stack shall be at
least 35 m high.
(7). The annual generation of waste metal parts and metal debris will be 250 tons and other
waste materials will be more than 100 tons. All these will be recovered and sold out. More
than 1,080 t/a of boiler slag can be used for road construction or as other construction
material. No negative impact on environment will occur.
(8). The main noise sources are mechanical processing equipment, air blowers and
compressors. Due to anti-vibration and enclosure measures, noise level at the project
boundary is 65 dB, lower than Class rV (GB 12348-90). The noise basically has no impact on
surrounding residential areas because of far distance.
(9). The environmental protection investment is 4.3 million RMB, about 7.3 % of the total
investment.
(10). The new facility will take over all major repair and medium maintenance work which
were done formerly by 8 existing depots. It will increase emission of dust by 13.5 t/a, S02 by
64 t/a, benzene by 188 kg/a, oil by 190 kg/a and CODcr by 2,284 kg/a in the project area,
30



Liaoning Urban Transport Project-Shenyang Subproject  Annex A: EIA of Shenyang Bus Repair Facility
however, it will reduce over all pollutant emission in Shenyang city. The repair capacity of
the project will be 3.3 times of the existing capacity. The implementation of the project will
be significant to improve maintenance technology of buses, meet the requirement of bus
repair capacity, develop public transportation and improve the city function.
(11). The land acquisition of the project is 60,000 m3, with resettlement of 80 green houses,
one school and one small paper mill. All these have been properly arranged.
(12). Operation of the new facility will increase the operation level of public transportation in
Shenyang, provide adequate service for vehicle maintenance, and is significance for the
development of overall urban functions. Environmental pollution mitigation are proposed for
whole production pt&ess to reduce pollution load. With all these proper measures, the
proposed project is environmentally feasible.

Liaoning Urban Transport Project-Shenyang Subproject           Annex B: Outline of MVECS
1.    Introduction
The implementation of Liaoning Urban Transport Project (LUTP) will result in increased
traffic and motor vehicle emissions, leading to deterioration of air quality along the project
,roads. Over the long term, the benefit brought by the project on air quality from a city
perspective will be offset by the expanded motor vehicle fleet. Eventually, motor vehicle
speeds on a city wide basis will slow down again and air quality in the project cities will
worsen. Although several quickly designed mitigation actions will be taken during the
operation phase, they are not able to fully address the fundamental cause of the long term air
quality impact by the project due to the complex nature of the issue.
The mitigation of the long term project impacts on air quality and, ultimately, sustained
improvement of air quality in the project cities call for a well researched and structured motor
vehicle emission control strategy (MVECS). The MVECS is to provide the accurate
assessment of present situation on motor vehicle emissions in the projects cities as well as the
trends in the future. Best available motor vehicle emission technologies and successful
experience in control motor vehicle emissions at home and from abroad will be evaluated for
their potential application in the project cities. On this basis, the MVECS will specify a series
of effective, site specific, integrated and goal oriented control, mitigation and remediation
measures to tackle the long term impact of the project on air quality.
Major efforts will be required in developing MVECS for each of the three project cities. A
technical assistance is therefore needed for necessary and appropriate technical and financial
resources. This document outlines the main scope and key elements in the proposed TA,
including responsible organizations, the means of TA, the contents of TA, estimated costs for
the TA and the TA implementation.
2.    The Responsible Organizations
LUCRPO and project offices in each city will be responsible for the implementation of this
strategy. A capable and experienced institute will be responsible for overall integration. Local
and foreign experts will be recruited as consultants. One research institute in each city will be
needed to be responsible for the strategy development, and this institute will be selected in
accordance with certain procedures based on the TOR.
3.    Means of Technical Assistance
3.1    Consulting Services
Consultants experienced with motor vehicle emission reduction will be retained. The lead
consultant will be responsible for development of MVECS, and supported by research
institutes from Shenyang, Anshan and Fushun which are most familiar with motor vehicle
fleet, air quality, urban and industrial development and local policies in air quality control and
environmental protection in general in their respective cities.
Since the local teams are limited by their experience in dealing witlh complicated strategies
for motor vehicle emission control and latest development in motor emission control



Liaoning Urban Transport Project-Shenyang Subproject        Annex B: Outline of MVECS
technologies, out-of-province consultants who are with these experience will be retained to
provide assistance and guidance in MVECS development.
3.2   Technical Workshop
A technical workshop will be held at the key stage of the MVECS development. At the
workshop, the local and out-off-province consultants will present the findings from their
initial study on the present motor vehicle issues in the project cities, trends in the future in
motor vehicle fleet and emissions, current mitigation measures and their effectiveness, and
local regulatory framework related to air quality in general and motor vehicle emission in
specific.
Leading experts in this area will be invited to participate in the workshop primarily those
from cities which have successfully developed and implemented an MVECS and improved
their air quality because of it. The experts are to provide their views and recommendations on
the problems presented to them and share their successes and leam from their lessons.
The objectives of the workshop will be exchange ideas, focusing on the specific issues facing
the project cities. The workshop will be organized as such that various motor vehicle
emission control measures will be discussed and debated for their effectiveness in addressing
the motor vehicle emissions and air quality issues unique to each of the project cities.
3.3   Overseas Study and Inspection
The provincial consultants as well as officials from the project cities responsible for
developing, adoption and implementing the MVECS will travel aboard to study similar
MVECS in countries such as the US or Canada. The study and inspection tour will be in cities
which already have include meetings with MVECS development and implementing agencies,
MVECS facilities, institutes or companies involved in motor vehicle emission control
technology research and application, and regulatory agencies directly relevant to air quality
control, particularly motor vehicle emission control. .
4     Contents of Technical Assistance
4.1   Information collection and current situation assessment
Information on the present situation on motor vehicle emissions in each of the project cites
will be collected and compiled. Assessment of the collected information will be made to
produce a clear and full understanding of various aspects of the motor vehicle emission issue
and its relation to air quality.
4.2   Research of the trends of the future
Future trends on the motor vehicle fleet, emission control teclnologies and other factors
which may affect the growth of motor vehicles such as population, urban development and
standard of living in the future will be researched. The objectives are to predict the variation
in motor vehicle emissions, air pollution load, and air quality in the future in the project
cities.

4.3   Study of advanced motor vehicle control technologies and programs
Various technologies in motor vehicle emission control and reduction will be studied. The
focus will be on their effectiveness and success in application.
4.4   Development control measures
On the basis of a clear understanding of the issues facing the project cities, the trends of
motor vehicle growth and impact of the emissions on air quality, and knowledge of motor
vehicle emission c.ontrol technologies and programs, a series of motor vehicle control
measures will be developed as the core of the strategy. These measures will include, but not
be limited to:   *
* stringent motor vehicle emission control standard and regulations;
* promote unleaded fuel;
* vehicle inspection and maintenance program;
* catalytic purification facilities;
* engine improvement;
- retirement of aged vehicles;
- monitor and enforcing the motor vehicle emission standards;
* promote public transportation;
* increase motor vehicle speeds;
e motor vehicle quantity control in urban centers; and
* develop clean or alternative fuel technologies.
4.6   Establishment of the implementing details
A detailed plan will be developed to ensure the strategy will be adopted and implemented.
The details may include designate executing/responsible agencies, implementinp schedule,
budget allocation, monitoring and reporting procedures, and feedback system.
4.6   Reporting
A report will be prepared as the deliverable from the consultants for developing the MVECS.
While in a single volume, the report will cover all three project cities and specify, where
appropriate, the unique measures and policies for each of the project cities. The report will
provide full details of the MVECS and can be readily used as guide for strategy
implementation and progress monitoring by relevant organizations.
5     Costs and Implementation
5.1   Cost
The estimated cost for the techllical assistance to develop an MVECS covering the three
project cities is presented in thie following table. It should be pointed out that more refined
cost for the TA will be developed when a fuLll terms of reference for MVECS development is
prepared.

Liaoning Urban Transport Project-Shenyang Subproject        Executive Summary
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Liaoning Urban Transport Project (LUTP) includes Shenyang Subproject, Anshan
Subproject and Fushun Subproject. This Environmental Impact Assessment(EIA) Report
focuses on the Shenyang Subproject of LUTP. It is developed in accordance with World
Bank OD 4.01, the review comments of State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA)
on the EIA outline for LUTP, and the requirement of ELA Guideline of SEPA.
Shenyang Subproject includes following components: public transport, traffic
management, infrastructure, road maintenance, and technical training and assistance. Each
component has specific subcomponents. The subcomponents with potential environmental
impact are: construction of a bus repair facility; renovation of Dadongmen Bus Terminal;
construction of Beiyi-Lianhe corridor, Gonghe Interchange, Jianshe-Nawu Corridor,
Fangxing Square Interchange; widening of Pangjiang Street; construction of Tianguang
Road and Shenzhou Road; renovation of South Nanjing Street, Zhulin Road, Heilongjiang
Street, and Sanjing Street (Figure 2.1.1-1 in page 8 shows the projects location).
The above mentioned subcomponents will change current use of land and introduce
potential impact on urban environment, therefore a detailed environmental impact
assessment is needed.
Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning Province, is the economic center and transportation hub
in the North-east area of China. As the reforming and opening developed in Shenyang, the
existing transport infrastructure can no longer meet the requirement of the increase of
traffic demand. In the view of the whole city, the air pollution is serious and noise level of
school, hospital, and residential building is higher than the standard.
Based on the monitoring results of existing air quality in the project area, the maximum
daily average concentration of NOx is 0.147 mg/ni3 (0.47 times higher than the standard)in
non-heating season and 0.692 mg/m3 (5.92 times higher than the standard)in heating
season; the maximum daily average concentration of CO is 4.438 mg/mi3 (0.11 times
higher than the standard)in non-heating season and 17.03 mg/m3 (3.26 times higher than
the standard)in heating season; the maximum daily average concentration of NMHC is
2.288 mg/m3 (1.29 times higher than the standard)in non-heating season and 3.963 mg/m3
(2.96 times higher than the standard)in heating season. The maximum existing noise level
is 76.6dB in the day-time (6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.) and 73.9dB in the night-time (10:00
p.m. to 6:00 a.m.). The standard-exceedance rate of existing noise level is 40.1% in day-
time and 75 % in night-time.
When the project is completed, the environmental quality will be improved in the city
center due to reduced traffic volume on the other roads and also a higher average speed on
these routes, however, the environmental immediately adjacent to the project route will be
negatively impacted with respect to air quality and noise.
In according to the results of prediction in the project area in 2010, the air quality impact is
most serious within 20 m away the redline(redline is the boundary line of the roadway) of
I



Liaoning Urban Transport Project-Shenyang Subproject            Executive Summary
the surface road and 30 m away of the elevated road, in which the impact of NOx is more
serious and the impact of CO, HC and NO2 are less. For instance, the maximum daily
average concentration of NOx will be 0.38 mg/m3 (2.8 times higher than the standard).
Concerning the other pollutants, the maximum daily average concentration of CO will be
55 9 mg/m3 (0.4 times higher than the standard); the maximum daily average concentration
of HC will be 0.8 mg/r3 ,under the standard. However, from the point of view of total
pollution load, the impact of exhaust emission on the other roads in the urban city will be
decreased, because more traffic will be attracted to the other road after the completion of
the project. Therefore, the project will help slow down the ambient air quality degradation
in the city center in the short term.
The noise impact willkbe serious in some cases in the project area. The maximum noise
prediction in 2010 will be 93.2 dB in day-time and 77.7 dB in night-time. However, the
operation of the proposed road will decrease traffic volume of the existing roads in the ciry
center, About 20-30% of traffic on these road will be attracted to the newly built roads. It
is predicted that the noise level along the road in the city center will be reduced by 1-5 dB.
The main objective of EIA is to identify the feasibility of Shenyang Subproject in view of
environmental protection. This report will, prior to the project, identify environmental
issues and potential environmental impact that the project will have on air, water, noise,
vegetation, sunshine and social economy during construction and operation phases, and
subsequently, put forward mitigation measures that will minimnize the environmental
impact. These measures will be included in the preliminary design of Shenyang
Subproject.
Sound Absorption Barriers are included in the preliminary design, which can protect some
sensitive receptors such as schools and hospitals with high noise levels. Moreover, air
conditioners and double glazed windows will be used as noise mitigation measure for the
residential buildings with high noise level. During construction phase, the contractors will
abide by the noise and vibration mitigation measures presented in the Environmental
Action Plan(EAP) to minimize the noise impact, such as using low noise machinery and
rationalizing work schedule and siting, etc.
Construction dust is the major air pollutant in construction phase. All contractors will
follow the dust mitigation mentioned in EAP to reduce air pollution during construction
phase. For instance, debris forn building demolition must be moved away in a day and
the construction site of viaduct or interchange will be enclosed with magnesite slab or
plastic fibre(2-3 m height); vehicles transporting loose materials must be covered with
straw mats, etc.
However, the implementation of Shenyang Subproject will result in increased traffic and
motor vehicle emissions, leading to deterioration of air quality along the project roads.
Over the long term, the benefit brought by the project on air quality from a city perspective
will be offset by the expanded motor vehicle fleet. Eventually, motor vehicle speeds on a
city wide basis will slow down again and air quality in the project cities will worsen.
The mitigation of the long term project impacts on air quality and, ultimately, sustained
improvement of air quality in the project cities call for a well researched and structured
motor vehicle emission control strategy (MVECS). The MVECS is to provide the accurate
2



Liaoning Urban Transport Project-Shenyang Subproject             Executive Summary
assessment of present situation on motor vehicle emissions in the projects cities as well as
the trends in the future. Best available motor vehicle emission technologies and successful
experience in control motor vehicle emissions at home and from abroad will be evaluated
for the potential application in the project cities. On this basis, the MVECS will specify a
series of effective, site specific, integrated and goal oriented control, mitigation and
remediation measures to tackle the long tern impact of the project on air quality.
Major efforts will be required in developing MVECS for each of the three project cities. A
technical assistance is therefore needed for necessary and appropriate technical and
financial resources. The outline of MIVECS detailed in Annex B.
Shenyang Subproject Office and Shenyang Environmental Protection Bureau will take the
responsibility to handle environmental issues and surpervise the implementation of the
mitigation during construction and operation phases. The specific staff of the constructor
team and the project office will be in charge of daily environmental issues to minimize
public complaints and environmental concerns.
In order to implement the environmental mitigation measures, the environmental
monitoring and training plan are developed in this ELA. Environmental monitoring is
normally undertaken during both construction and operation phases to ensure mitigation
measures effectively, to respond to unanticipated environmental concerns at an early stage
and to determine the accuracy of impact predictions. Specific monitoring programs are
presented as well as responsibilities for the collection and analysis of data and reporting
requirements in Chapter 5 in page 107-112. Meanwhile, the training of contractors is
critical for the project implementation. Without appropriate environmental awareness and
knowledge and skills required for the implementation of the mitigation measures, it would
be difficult for contractors to effectively implement the mitigation. On the other hand, it is
also important to train the managers of the project construction agencies to fully
understand related environmental laws and regulations.
The total estimated investment of Shenyang Subproject is 1,310 million Yuan RMB, in
which the investment of the project with potential environmental impact is bout 647
million.. The total cost estimate of environment mitigation is 57.70 million, including
35,000 Yuan RMB for training, 81,000 for procurement of environmental monitoring
equipment, and 891,300 for environmental monitoring program during construction and
operation phases.
In summary, Liaoning Urban Transport Project (LUTP)-Shenyang Subproject will assist in
providing a solution to traffic congestion in the city center, improve the quality of urban
life and stimulate economic development. It also create a nice condition to develop new
space for the city, calming the existing traffic and improve ecological environment.
The project will result in some degradation of air quality within the immediate vicinity of
the alignment (about 150 m) but will make a positive contribution to air quality
improvement in the overall urban area, especially in the city center. The noise level will
also be increased in some sections of the roads.
From the view of pollutant load control in the city, the project has obvious environmental
and social benefit. Therefore, the project is feasible environmentally, if the preferTed

option for particular road sections are selected, and if the recommended mnitigation
measures are implemented effectively, which these measures will help prevent and
minimize potentially adverse impacts. The project also allows for the opportunity to
enhance the environment in the city center though longer term solutions such as traffic
management, urban planning and implementing the various components of the motor
vehicle pollution control proposals in the near future.

2.1.2 Role in Transport Planning
In the study on Shenyang Urban Transport Planning, the Municipality is forming a road
network with three-ring and fourteen-line. The Second and Third Ring Roads have already
been constructed in the suburbs and surrounding areas, which can effectively meet the traffic
-demand in suburbs and through traffic demand. However, the traffic volume in city center
within the First Ring Road required major improvements. The city center is mixed with
commercial, residential, educational and cultural, and industrial zones, with high density of
population, narrow roads, heavy traffic and frequent congestion.
Figure 2.1.2-1 shows the traffic planning for urban road in Shenyang. The Subproject,
identified according to the justification of road network by Shenyang Municipal Construction
Commission and Shenyang Municipal Planning Design Institute, will focus on improving
structure of existing road network and developing public transportation. The specific
functions of the major actions are as follows:
. Bus Repair Facility and Bus Terminal in Dadongmen: improve the overall maintenance
performance of buses, increase the availability rate of the fleet, reduce failures in service,
and improve the comfort and safety of the vehicles;
* Beiyi-Lianhe Corridor: lead smooth traffic in east-west in the city center and permit
existing parallel Shifu Road to play a distribution function;
* Jianshe-Nanwu Corridor: alleviate the traffic congestion caused by the railway grade
crossing in east-west in the south area of the city;
* Pangjiang Street Improvement: connect the missing link and improve traffic capacity the
First Ring Road;
* Road widening and missing link connection: provide better road condition.

Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject                 Environmental Impact Assessment
The research conducted by the Shenyang Municipal Engineering Design Institute indicated
that the existing trunks undertake 62.9% traffic volume of the whole city, however, the length
of these trunks is just 22.8% of the total length of road network. The average speed on these
trunks is only 21.4 km/hr. Because of the heavy traffic volume (Table 2.4.2-1 and Table
2.4.2-2) on existing Beiyi Road, Pangjiang Street and Jianshe-Nanwu Road, the saturation
and congestion resulted in slow traffic.

2.4.2.2Traffic Forecast
A traffic forecast was conducted by Shenyang Planning Design Institute. It is predicted that
there will respectively be 172,000, 354,000 and 666,000 vehicles in the central area by the
year 2000, 2010 and 2020. Figure 2.4.2-2 and Figure 2.4.2-3 show the existing traffic
volume and the predicted volume in 2010 respectively in the city center.
The traffic volume prediction for the proposed actions with heavy traffic is presented in
Table 2.4.2-3 and Table 2.4.2-4.

Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject  Environmental Impact Assessment
3.2.2 Air Quality
3.2.2.1 Monitoring Site Layout
The roads involved in the proposed project are located in the central urban area of Shenyang.
Along these roads are residential buildings, schools, hospitals, day care centers, shops and
industries. According to requirement of EIA outline, 10 monitoring sites were selected in the
environmental sensitive receptors for monitoring of ambient air quality. The site layout is
shown in Figure 3.2.2-1.
3.2.2.2 Monitoring Time and Frequency
Ambient air quality monitoring was conducted for two times in Oct. 1996 and Jan. 1997, and
7 consecutive days for each time (Oct. 25 - Oct. 31, 1996 and Jan. 7 - Jan. 13, 1997). 24 hours
continuous sampling was conducted for daily average of TSP, SO2, NOx, Pb and B(a)P; and
hourly sampling was conducted four times a day (7:30-8:30; 12:00-13:00; 17:00-18:00) for
hourly average of SO2, NOx, CO and NMHC. Meanwhile, meteorological data such as wind
direction, wind speed, temperature and atmospheric pressure were also monitored.
3.2.2.3 Parameters and Applicable Standard
The parameters to be monitored include: NOx, CO, NMHC, TSP, SO2, Pb, B(a)P.
The standard adopted is Class 2 of National Ambient Air Quality Standard (GB3095-1996).
A specific provincial standard of DB21-60-89 was used for assessment of NMHC (Table
1.3.2-1).
3.2.2.4 Monitoring Result and Assessment
The monitoring results of ambient air quality is shown in Table 3.2.2-1, Table 3.2.2-2, and
Table 3.2.2-3.                               -

Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject  Environmental lmpact Assessment
It can be concluded from the monitoring results that:
a) The ambient air quality of the project area fairly polluted, suffering medium pollution
during non-heating season and severe pollution during heating season. Environmental air
pollution is mainly caused by vehicle exhaust during non-heating season, and the air is
mainly polluted by coal combustion of boiler during heating season.
b) For NOx in Table 3.2.2-1, during non-heating season, except the site of Lifu Hospital, all
the maximum daily averages of other sites exceed standard ranging from 0.03 to 0.47
times, with a maximum reading at No.107 Middle School; the maximum daily hourly
averages of all sites exceed standard by 0.10-2.13 times, with a maximum reading at West
Yushan Apartment. During heating season, all the maximum of daily and hourly average
exceed the standard (0.14-5.29 times and 0.15-9.31 times respectively), with a maximum
daily reading at Shenyang Railway Branch Bureau and a hourly maximum at Shenyang
University.
c) For CO, it can be seen in Table 3.2.2-2 that, during non-heating season, only the maximum
daily average at West Yushan Apartment exceeds standard by 0.11 times, and no
exceedance over standard for hourly averages at all sites. While during heating season, all
the maximum of daily averages exceed standard by 0.68-3.26 times, with a maximum
reading at Shenyang Railway Branch Bureau; and the maximum hourly averages at all
sites exceed the standard, with a maximum of 2.19 times at Shenyang Railway Branch
Bureau.
d) For NMHC in Table 3.2.2-3, during non-heating season, all daily average readings exceed
the standard, with maximum exceedance of 1.29 times, and no exceedance for all hourly
averages. While, during heating, all daily average readings exceed standard ranging from
2.12-2.96 times. The maximum hourly averages at all sites exceed standard by 0.32-0.6
times, with 13%-85.7% readings exceeding the standard.
In general, the ambient air quality along the roads is fairly polluted, mainly due to automobile
exhaust emission.
3.2.3 Noise
3.2.3.1Monitoring Site Layout
For the principle of monitoring site layout, 15 sampling points were selected near hospitals,
schools, day care centers, residential buildings along the proposed road (see Table 3.2.3-1).
The applied guideline is Measurement Method of Environmental Noise in Urban Areas
(GB/T4623). The site layout is shown in Figure 3.2.2-2.
3.2.3.2 Monitoring Time and Frequency
Noise monitoring was carried out in Oct. 1996, and 7 consecutive days for each time (Oct.
25-Nov. 1, 1996). 9 AM to 23 PM continuous sampling was conducted. Meanwhile, traffic
volume was recorded.
3.2.3.3 Monitoring Result and Assessment
The monitoring results of ambient air quality is shown in Table 3.2.3-1.

Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject  Environmental Impact Assessment
The monitoring results indicated that: 40.1% of day-time Leq averages exceeded the standard
ranging from 0.lto 6.6 dB and 75% of night-time Leq exceeded the standard ranging from
2.0 to 18.9 dB. It is shown that the noise levels of day-time were fairly high along Jianshe-
Nanwu Road, Beiyi Road(1-1), Lianhe Road(1-2), Nanjingnan Street. The highest noise
levels of night-time was presented along Jianshe-Nanwu Road, and those were quite high
along Beiyi Road(I-1), Lianhe Road, and Dadongmen Bus Terminal.
3.2.4 Vibration
Five monitoring points were selected in the Subproject area. The monitoring was compliance
with national standard Monitoring Method for Environmental Vibration in Urban Areas GB
10071-88. The site layout is shown in Figure 3.2.2-3 and monitoring results are presented in
Table 3.2.4-1.
The monitoring indicated that vibration levels in the Subproject area are under the limit of the
standard except some certain points (0.3 times higher than the standard during day-time). At
these points vibration levels exceeded the standard due to large volume of traffic.

There is little bared soil within built-up area of Shenyang, since most lands are covered by
buildings and roads, except some left in parks and green space along the streets.
There isn't much vegetation involved in the project. The vegetation are mainly trees(such as
willow, cypress, poplar, elm, etc.) and lawns, including:
* Beiyi Road (1-1): 261 trees;
* Lianhe Road (1-2, 1-3): 62,026 m2 lawn, 5,000 m2 green barrier, and 5,522 trees and

a total output of 4 billion RMB. There are also a number of commercial, educational, medical
and government buildings and facilities along the project area. It can be concluded that the
areas along the project roads are main economic development areas in Shenyang, in which
along Beiyi Road is heavy industrial area, along Lianhe Road and East Jianshe Road are light
industrial and financial areas, while along Lianhe and Nanwu Road are tertiary industrial
areas including hotels, restaurants, service facilities, some government buildings and schools.

Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject  Environmental Impact Assessment
4. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS
4.1 Issues and Concerns
This chapter provides an overview of the analysis carried out to evaluate the potential impacts
of the LUTP-Shenyang Subproject on the various environmental components, which include
Beiyi-Lianhe Corridor, Jianshe-Nanwu Corridor, Pangjiang Street, Sanjing Street,
Helongjiang Street, Nanjingnan Street, Zhulin Road, Tianguang Street, Shenzhou Road,
Bashan Road, Dadong Road and Shengli Road Improvement; the Bus Repair Facility and the
Dadongmen Bus Terminal.
The proposed roads,Awith long length and heavy traffic, are the trunks in the city. The impacts
on high-density residential, commercial areas, lots of schools and some important institutions
along the roads are fairly serious. Thus, Category A of environmental impact assessment will
be carried out for the areas impacted. This analysis was based on the evaluation of the
existing environment as described in Chapter 3 for these parameters as well as a prediction of
conditions which were likely during construction and operation phases. A summary of the
assumptions, modifications and limitations of the models utilized in there analysis is
presented in Table 4.1-1. Additional details associated with the specific models can be found
in the Chinese EA Report. Detailed surveys for socio-economy, public participation have
been made.
These sensitive receptors are selected representing high-density residential areas, hospitals,
schools, day care centers, important office buildings, cultural heritage and tourism resorts,
which have higher requirement for the environment of air quality, noise and sunshine.
Analysis was carried out by comparison of environmental factors with and without the project
and comparison of alternatives and the preferred option. This was help determine the
potential environmental impact of the project during construction and operation phases, and
provide mitigation measures. Meanwhile, the preferred option and alternatives were shown to
the public in the project area. The public opinions were considered in the designs to reduce
the potential impact of the project.
The background data used in the assessment were monitored in 1996. The impacts of the
project are assessed until the year 2010 according to the requirement of TOR.

4.2 Air Quality
LUTP-Shenyang Subproject will improve transportation in the urban center. Vehicles will
move faster, and there will be less congestion at intersections. It is predicted that the average
speed in the city center will increase from current 21.4 km/hr to 29.8 km/hr in 2010 as a result
of the construction of the Subproject. Although the air quality in the project corridor will
deteriorate due to more traffic flow, higher vehicle speed and decreased travel time will result
in overall improvement of air quality in the city center. The assessment of air quality impacts
was designated to evaluate these issues.
4.2.1 Methodology
As recommended by consultants of the World Bank, US MOBLE 5 was employed to
determine emission. The input files for the model were based on the data and format used in
Beijing for the same task. A modified US EPA MOBILE 5 model was used to predict
emission factors of various vehicles in the project. The model was modified according to
specific characters in Shenyang, such as, distribution of vehicle age, disperse rate, attenuation
coefficient, fuel consumption/km, etc. The input meteorological parameters are listed in
Table 4.2.2-l.The related classification of MV is detailed in Chapter 2.
42



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject   Environmental Impact Assessment
The US EPA line-source model CALINE 3 was used to model the dispersion of vehicle
exhaust within 500 m along both sides of the road. Then assessment was conducted using the
predicted air quality to compare with Class 2 of GB3015-96 and DB21-60-89.
According to the predicted traffic data for 2010 in the feasibility report, the peak hour traffic
volume in 2010 was used to calculate the peak hour pollutant concentration in the down-wind
direction along both sides of the road; the non-peak hour traffic volume was used to calculate
the daily average concentration along the road sides.
The contents of prediction include the following aspects:
* Air quality with/without the project, and with alternatives; summer and winter of 2010;
peak hour and -on-peak hour concentration of NOx, CO and HC under dominant wind
direction and unfavourable meteorological condition and their daily average concentration
under the same condition during environmental monitoring period;
* Assessment for major environmentally sensitive locations.
The location of sensitive receptors is shown in Figure 3.2.2-1.
4.2.1.1Emission Model and Parameters
The process of pollutant emission, related to sorts of factors, is very complicated. Thus, the
emission coefficient is difficult to determine. US EPA MOBILE 5 is a suitable model, which
produces not only the emission coefficients of MVs, but also forecast of pollution emission.
The statistical pollutant emissions for different vehicles with different ages are the basic
parameters of the model. Some parameters, such as forecast year, mileage, speed and
temperature, are input based on the specific situation in Shenyang. The assumptions,
modifications and limitations are summarized in Table 4.1-1. The meteorological parameters
required include wind direction, wind speed, atmospheric stability, height of mix layer and
index of wind speed. The major conditions used in modelling is shown in Table 4.2.1-1.
Table 4.2.1-1   Temperature in Shenyan Area
Season    Average temperature (C)    Maximum average C  Minimum average (°C)
Winter           -9.6                   -4.3                   -20.7           I
Summer           23.2                   28.1                    18.3
4.2.1.2 Dispersion Model and Parameters
The US EPA line source model CALINE 3 was used to model vehicle emission dispersion on
the 5 road sections and 2 interchanges. The specific formulas of the model were presented in
the Chinese EA Report.
The base of CALINE 3 is still Gaussian line source. Research of Rao (1979, 1980) and
Eskridge (1979a, 1979b) shows that dispersion of pollutants on road mainly depends on the
turbulence caused by vehicles, while ambient atmospheric stability only plays a minor role.
Based on the comparison of GM test ( by Cadle in 1976) and LIE test ( by Rao in 1978) with
PG curve, even though most of the GM data were obtained under stable atmospheric
43



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject       Environmental Impact Assessment
condition, while its dispersion coefficient is between A and C of PG category. Therefore,
modification was adopted in the calculation. Considering the roughness of urban area, the
stability was adjusted towards one category more unstable for calculation.
In the application of CALINE 3, according to the requirement of the World Bank, dispersion
coefficient of US EPA MOBILE 5 was used. The input file for MOBILE 5 is a modification
from a similar project in Beijing. The relevant assumptions, modifications and limitations are
presented in Table 4.1-1.
The meteorological parameters used in the model are summarized in Table 4.2.1-2. More
details are shown in the Chinese EA Report.

The atmospheric condition during background monitoring (Oct. 25-31, 1996 and Jan. 6-12,
1997) was used to predict daily average values. The meteorological characters of the
monitoring results are consistent with those of the statistics within the past three years. The
major parameters of this condition is listed in Table 4.2.1-3.

4.2.2 Vehicle Emission Inventory
The emission(g/km) for single vehicle (gasoline and diesel) with various speeds in winter and
summer is predicted in 2010. The results summarized in Table 4.2.2-1 are used to predict the
emission in peak and non-peak in winter and summer.
It can be seen from the prediction results that, the road section 1-2 (Gonghe Bridge-
Xiaobeiguan Street) has the highest emission among the 5 sections. The reason is because
most part of this section has already reached the width which is required by the urban plan,
especially the width of the road between Beijing Street and Huigong Square has already been
extended to 60 m. Therefore, there is a fairly high traffic volume in this section. When the
project is completed, more traffic will be introduced causing high pollution emission.
The section 2-1 (Nanwu Road - Jianshe Road) has the emission just second to the section 1-2.
Currently it is the main road leading to Tiexi District, and when the project is completed,
operation of both viaduct and surface road will inevitably attract more traffic volume, hence
resulting in increase of pollution emission. Table 4.2.2-2 shows the details of pollution
emission.

Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject   Environmental Impact Assessment
4.2.3 Impact Analysis
4.2.3.1 Construction Phase
The main pollution during construction phase is air-borne dust on construction site and along
transportation routes of construction vehicles, as well as exhaust emission of construction
vehicles. The most serious pollution is the short-time air-borne dust caused by material
feeding and operation of on-site construction vehicles. This pollution will present obvious
impact within 40 m down-wind on both sides of construction sections, and little impact
beyond 40 m. This conclusion is obtained based on the investigation of the completed Second
Ring Road in Shenyang. The investigation was conducted in Autumn, which has similar
meteorological condition to that of this proposed project, because winter is not construction
season in Shenyangk.
Impact analysis during construction phase will address two aspects as follows:
a) Air-borne Dust
(1) Pangjiang Street (3-1): The construction of this section is to widen the existing road, the
section between Xiaoheyan Road and Shenhai Interchange. Traffic will remain during the
construction phase. Main sensitive receptors (No. 107 Middle School and South
Shenkuang Apartment) are beyond 40m, therefore there will be little impact on them.
Additionally, because this section is south-north oriented, while the frequency of west or
east wind is low in Shenyang area, hence the project will have little impact on the road
sides even within 40m.
(2) Beiyi Road (1-1): The section between Baogong Street and Songgong Street is narrow,
and the section between Songgong Street and Xinggong Street is not paved yet. There will
be lots of resettlement for the north side of the road, hence certain air-borne dust will be
caused by demolition of old buildings. However, within 40m on the south side of the
section east to Songgong Street located the Lifu Hospital, which will be impacted by the
project.
(3) Lianhe Road (1-2): The section west of Huanghe Street to Fushun Road will be widened,
which will have little impact. While the section between Fushun Road and Gonghe
Interchange has not been paved currently, but reserved according to the city planning. The
construction of this section will cause air-borne dust pollution on residential area (ca. 300
families, with nearest distance of 20m) and Xita School, which is 30m to the east.
(4) Lianhe Road (1-3): The construction is the widening of existing section between
Xiaobeiguan Street and Beihai Street. For the west part of the section which has major
- engineering work, there is basically no residential area along both sides, except Shenyang
University. However, the sport field of the university where has most concentrated
students is 50 m away from the road, therefore, dust pollution during construction will
have a little impact on it.
(5) Nanwu Road (2-1): This section will have the most serious dust pollution impact among
the project sections. Because there is a railway crossing, which increases difficulty and
makes closed construction impossible. So the construction is to done by phases. Apart
47



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject  Environmental Impact Assessment
from normal traffic volume, additional construction vehicles will increase more
congestion. In addition, along the west part of this section, there exist Tielu Middle
School, South Yushan Apartment, West Yushan Apartment, Day care center of CB, and
residential buildings (ca. 2000 people in 600 families) within 40m distance. These
sensitive receptors will be impacted by the project.
(6) Gonghe Interchange: The residents within construction site (east of Gonghe Interchange
and north of Shifu Road) will be resettled, and no other receptors exist. To the west of the
interchange is a railway marshalling station, to the south is Shengli Road. Hence, little
impact of dust pollution will occur.
(7) The Asphalt Planf is located in the suburban area, with no impact on urban air quality.
Sand and gravel whil be drawn from Hunhe River, and canvas will be used to prevent dust
in the course of transportation. The cement mixing facility will also be far away from
urban center, presenting no impact at all on urban area.
(8) The Bus Repair Facility will be constructed in suburban area, hence impose no impact on
urban air in terms of air-borne dust. The Dadongmen bus terminal is to be constructed in
the urban area. However, enclosure will be installed to prevent air-borne dust.
(9) For Tianguang Street, Shenzhou Road, Sanjing Street, Zhulin Road, Nanjingnan Street
and Heilongjiang Street, construction work will include widening of existing roads and
missing link connection. However, because these are generally short roads, the
construction phase will be short too, therefore, with proper mitigation measures (such as
enclosure or semi-enclosure, and well-organized construction), impact on environment
can be minimized.
b) Exhaust Emission
The construction vehicles will increase traffic volume in the urban area, therefore generally
increase exhaust emission. However, the- major impacted area is still limited within the
project corridor. Based on the prediction, the most impacted scope is the area within 20 m
down-wind (30 m for viaduct). Hence, the exhaust emission construction vehicles will have
an increased impact to those non-closed construction sections (e.g. 3-1, 1-3 and 2-1), and
decreased impact on those closed construction sections (e.g. 1-1).
4.2.3.2 Operation Phase
a) Peak Hour Concentration
The modelling results show that when the project is completed, the mobile source emissions
will cause severe impact on pollutant concentration along both sides of the road, especially
within 20m ( 30m for viaduct) and under the most stable atmospheric conditions, e.g. , the
peak hour concentration of NOx is 0.65 mg/mr3, CO is 11.18 mg/m3 , HC is 1.68 mg/m3,
N02 is 0.07 mg/mr3  in Shenyang University on Lianhe Road. Only the maximum
concentrations of various pollutants are analyzed in this report based on severe impact. The
background value is not included in the prediction.

NOx
The applied standard for NOx is Class 2 of Air Quality Standard (0.15 mg/m3). Compared
with CO and HC, NOx has the most serious impact (covering an area of 500 m on both sides
of the road). Especially for the Pangjiang Street (3-1), the maximum concentration is 1.03
Mmg/m3, exceeding the standard by 5.87 times. Table 4.2.3-1 shows the predicted maximum
peak hour concentration of NOx in winter, under stable meteorological condition. According
to the emission inventory, the emission of 3-1 section is not the largest, however it has the
largest concentration. This is due to the road orientation, traffic speed and meteorological
condition. The 3-1 section is a south-north direction road, while the prevailing wind direction
of Shenyang is south and north, therefore, most of the pollutants will remain on the road
instead disperse to-both sides. Meanwhile, the concentration in Nanjingnan Street is quite
high, with the maxklnum of 0.79 mg/m3 exceeding the standard by 4.27 times.

CO
The applied standard is 10.0 mg/m3. The impact of CO is basically limited within 50m (Table
4.2.3-2). The most seriously impacted roads by CO are the same that seriously impacted by
NOx.
Around the cross of Gonghe Interchange and Lianhe Road, the CO concentration will exceed
standard within an area of 4,500 m2 (from Gonghe Interchange to Shengli Street), causing
impact on pedestrians (Fig. 4.2.3-1).
Around the overpass of Fangxing Square, the CO concentration will exceed standard within
an area of 38,400 m2. This mainly covers south part of the overpass (e.g. North East
Electricity Administration Bureau). While NE Architecture Design Institute, Liaoning
Hydropower Survey Institute and Jianzhu restaurant in the south will be less impacted (Fig.
4.2.3-2).

HC
The applied standard here is 3.00 mg/m3. Compared with CO and NOx, HC has the minimum
impact on ambient air quality. There is no standard-exceeding prediction occurs. The
maximum concentration is 2.6 mg/m3.
NO2                                '
The applied standard is 0.12 mg/m3. NO2 is 10% of NOx. The maximum concentration of
NO2 is 0.10 mg/mr3 in Beihai Street, under the standard.
b) Daily Average Concentration
The modelling results show that when the project is completed, the mobile source emissions
will cause impact on both sides of the road. The impact of NOx daily average concentration is
serious and the zone of influence is 100 m. The impact of CO daily average concentration is
less and the zone of influence is 40 m. Only the maximum concentration of the pollutant will
be analyzed in the report.
NOx
The applied standard here is 0.10 mg/m3. The standard-exceeding scope is within 100 m. The
most seriously impacted section is Beiyi Road (1-1), with maximum concentration of 0.38

c) Impacts on Sensitive Receptors
The principle showed in impact on sensitive receptor is similar with that of above. Prediction
shows that NOx has more impact on these points than CO, while HC has the least. Figure
4.2.3-4 shows concentration predictions of major pollutant of air quality of sensitive receptor.
(1) Peak Hour Concentrations on Sensitive Receptors
Table 4.2.3-5 shows the peak hour concentrations on above sensitive receptors. It can
concluded  that the peak  hour concentrations of NOx  exceed  standard  on  all sensitive
receptors. Especially for Lifu Hospital, the NOx concentration exceeds standard under all
kinds of meteorological conditions, and the maximum  concentration exceeds by 3.83 times.
The CO concentraitin  exceeds standard by 0.119 time at Lifu Hospital, and under standard at
other points. There is no standard-exceeding at all points for HC.

Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject      Environmental Impact Assessment
4.2.3.3 Impact Assessment of the Bus Repair Facility and Dadongmen Bus Terminal
A bus repair facility and a bus terminal are proposed to be built in Shenyang.
The proposed capacity of the bus repair facility is 1,000 buses, 1,200 engines and 1,200
chases annually. The major pollutant produced by the facility is benzene, methyl benzene and
xylene caused by paint-spaying waste gas, HC, dust and SO2 came from boiler chimneys.
The ground parking floor is used for buses and the floor underground is used for social
parking. The capacity of the Bus Terminal in Dadongmen is 34 buses on the ground parking
floor and 108 automobiles on the underground parking floor.
(1) Impact on the B*s Repair Facility
The pollution of the ambient air is mainly caused by the paint-spaying waste gas, engine test
smoke and boiler smoke. The Bus Repair Facility is industrial pollution source. Table 4.2.3-7
is 2010 pollutant emission prediction of the Bus Repair Facility.

It shown in Table 4.2.3-7 that the hourly maximum concentrations of the pollutants are much
lower than related standards. Therefore, the pollutant emission during operation will have
little impact on the environment.
(2) Impact on the Dadongmen Bus Terminal
The pollution of the ambient air is mainly caused by the exhaust emission of the
vehicle. Table 4.2.3-8 is 2010 pollution emission prediction of the Bus Terminal. It can be
concluded that the daily average concentration of TSP, SO2 , NOx, CO and HC of Dadong
Bus Terminal are respectively 1.63, 0.27,1.66, 1.54 and 2.29 times higher than the standards.

Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject         Environmental Impact Assessment
4.2.3.4 Analysis of Comparison With vs Without the Project
MOBILE 5 is used to calculate the emission, based on the volume prediction. Then, CALINE
3 is used to produce daily average and hourly average for all pollutants with and without and
project. The peak hour concentrations and daily average concentrations were predicted for all
rbad sections based on with and without the project, under various meteorological conditions.
Difference can be shown in the comparison of emission for the same sensitive receptor or
road section with vs without the project. The contribution to the urban city with and without
the project can be seen through comparison of the pollutant emission alone the road and the
emission in the urban.city.
a) Comparison of Pe ak Hour Concentrations
The peak hour concentrations of NOx, CO and HC along Beijing Street to Huigong Square
(1-2) and Nanwu Road (2-1) without the project will be higher than with. The concentrations
of the pollutants along other road sections with the project will be higher than without.
It can be summarised in Table 4.2.3-9 that the peak hour concentrations of HC and NO2
with/without the project are under the standard, the concentrations of NOx with/without
exceed the standard, and the concentrations of CO with/without exceed the standard with a
few exceptions (Beiyi Road without, 1-3 without).
The prediction also shows that the ambient air quality along Nanwu Road (2-1) and Lianhe
Road (1-2) is obviously improved with than without; the ambient air quality along other roads
is deteriorated in some extent with than without. But from the view of the whole urban city,
the pollutant load will decrease by the contribution of the project, especially the contribution
of Beiyi Road.

b) Comparison of Daily Average Concentration
The daily average concentrations of NOx, CO and HC along Beijing Street to Huigong
Square(1-2 without the project will be higher than with. The concentrations of the pollutants
along other road sections with the project will be higher than without.
Table 4.2.3-10 shows the comparison of the daily average concentration of the pollutants
with/without the project. It can be summarized that the daily average concentrations of NOx
exceed the standard with and without the project, in which the concentration along road
section 1-2 exceeds 3.0 times than the standard with the project and 4.1 times without, the
daily average concentrations of HC with/without the project are under the standard with
one exception (road section 1-2 without, 0.3 times of exceedance), the concentrations of CO
with exceed the stbndard with a few exceptions(Pangjiang Street, Fangxing Square), the
concentrations of CO without are under the standard with a few exception(Lianhe Road, 1.18
times of exceedance, Nanwu Road). All NO2 readings are under the standard with and
without the project.
It can be concluded that the project implementation will help improve the daily average
concentrations of air quality in the urban city.

(1) Peak Hour Concentration Comparison
The peak hour concentrations on all sensitive receptors are predicted based on with and
without the project, and the results are shown in Table 4.2.3-11. It can be seen that most of
the sensitive receptors have a higher peak hour value with the project than without, except
West Yushan Apartment and the Day care center of CB.

d) Pollution Emission Comparison With vs Without
The MOBILE 5 model was also used to predict the pollution emission in 2010 without the
project (Table 4.2.3-13). Compared with Table 4.2.2-3 (Peak hour emission and non-peak
hour emission in the winter and summer of 2010), it can be concluded that both the peak hour
and non-peak hour emissions with the project are higher than without. The peak hour
emission of NOx, CO and HC with the project are 1.37, 1.25 and 1.24 times that of without
respectively, and non-peak hour emission of NOx, CO and HC with the project are 1.49, 1.22
and 1.49 times that of without respectively. However, the emissions with the project of
Nanwu Road, Sanjing Street, Zhulin Road, Nanjingnan Street and Helongjiang Street are
higher than those of without. This comparison is also shown in Figure 4.2.3-5.

Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject       Environmental Impact Assessment
4.2.3.5 Air Quality Comparison with vs without the Project in Shenyang Urban City
in 2010
a) 2010 Exhaust Emission With/Without the Project Compared with Total MV Emission in
Shenyang
According to the vehicle development prediction in the feasibility study report, the total
amount of MV will reach 354,000 by the year of 2010, with an annual increase of 6.0%. The
total MV trips in 2010 will be 1.25 million, with an annual increase of 6.3%. Based on
Shenyang Environmental Quality Report in 1995, the annual average increase rate of
pollutant emission of MV in Shenyang is 16. 1% . By the end of 1995, the annual emission of
CO was 80,021 tohs, NOx 17,442 tons, and HC 15,507 tons. If the average increase rate
remains 16.0%, the-kannual emissions of CO, NOx and HC will respectively 111,816 tons,
23,919 tons, and 21,451 tons by the year 2010.
Table 4.2.3-14 (Figure 4.2.3-6) shows the comparison of exhaust emission (with/without the
project) with total MV emission in Shenyang. It is obvious that emission in the project
corridor with the project is higher than without, indicating more impact on road sides will be
introduced due to the project. But from the view of the whole city, increase of emission in the
project road means decrease of emission in other areas. In fact, with the project, the MV
emission in urban center is lower than without. For instance, the emission of CO will
decrease by 31.1%, HC by 45.8% and NOx by 49.6%. It can be concluded that the project
will lead to improvement of air quality in the city center, hence is feasible.

b) Comparison of Air Quality for Typical Road Sections with/without the Project in
Shenyang Urban City in 2010
Beier Road is selected as typical road section for the comparison. It indicated in Table 4.2.3-
15 that CO hourly average concentration with the project is 0.9 mg/mr3 less than without, NOx
with is 0.1 mg/m3 less than without, and HC with is 0.6 mg/m3 less than without; CO daily
average concentration with the project is 0.3 mg/m3 less than without, NOx with is 0.04
mg/m3 less than without, and HC with is 0.19 mg/m3 less than without. It can be concluded
that the proposed roads will attract more traffic after implementation, thus, the air quality in
urban city will be improved due to less traffic volume.

4.2.4 Mitigation
4.2.4.1 Construction Phase
The mitigation measures during construction phase mainly deal with dust of construction sites
and transportation route, and exhaust emission of construction vehicles.
a) Dust
*  The construction will be well scheduled. When the wind is higher than 6 level, the
construction caused dust will be prohibit.
*  The demolished construction materials will be transported to proper site in a day. Any
dusty materials will be transported to the construction site when available and can not be
stored.
*  Construction sections of interchanges and viaduct will also be enclosed with magenisite
slab or plastic fibre of 2-3 m height. Meanwhile, construction material (such as lime,
sand) will be stored in temporary workshops or covered by canvas.
*  When the wind is higher than 3 level, water will be sprayed once a hour within
construction sites in windy spring and fall to avoid dust pollution.
*  Transport trucks with loose materials will be covered with canvas.
*  When on-site cast of concrete is necessary for some structure, such as the foundations of
the viaduct in Nanwu Road, the concrete will not be mixed in the construction site and
must be transported from the concrete mix station in the plant outside the urban center.
b) Exhaust of Construction Vehicles
* Construction machinery will be properly operated, maintained and repaired to reduce
exhaust emission.
64



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject  Environmental Impact Assessment
* The route of the truck will be rationally arrange to be far away the sensitive receptors.
c) Environmental Monitoring
Environmental monitoring during construction phase will focus on dust and exhaust emission
of construction vehicles. The monitoring will be carried out one time in summer by Shenyang
Environmental Monitoring Center. The monitored factors include TSP, NOx, CO and HC.
The sampling points for TSP are located near the construction sections and transportation
routes.
4.2.4.2 Operation Phase
The implementatioh of the Subproject will result in increased traffic and motor vehicle
emissions, leading to deterioration of air quality along the project roads. Over the long terrn,
the benefit brought by the project on air quality from a city perspective will be offset by the
expanded motor vehicle fleet. Therefore, the mitigation of the long term project impacts on
air quality, and, ultimately, sustained improvement of air quality in the city call for a motor
vehicle emission control strategy. A technical assistance is therefore needed for necessary and
appropriate technical and financial resources. Shenyang Project Office is mainly responsible
for developing this strategy with the other two project cities and related provincial agencies
before Dec. 2001, and Shenyang Environmental Protection Bureau is mainly responsible for
the implementation of the strategy since Dec. 2002. The total input for the development of the
strategy will be estimated as 40 man-months of local consultants and 15 man-months of out-
of-province consultants. The cost estimate of the strategy is about 150,000 USD. About
400,000 Yuan RMB will be input by Shenyang. Details are presented in Annex B: Outline of
Technical Assistance for Development of Motor Vehicle Emission Control Strategy.
Specific mitigation measures in operation phase are as follows:
a) Promotion of Public Transportation and Separation of MVs and NMVs
Two bus routes and four bus-only lanes will be newly developed during the operation phase
of the project. Comfortable, convenient buses will attract more passengers to reduce the
percentage of automobile trip on street. Therefore, the exhaust emission of MVs will be
reduced.
Green barriers will be built respectively 3 m, 7 m for Beiyi Road and Lianhe Road. Pangjiang
Street and Nanwu Road will have two green barriers on each side of the road to separate MVs
and NMVs with respectively 3 m and 2 m after the implementation. The green barriers will
reduce the dust and beauty the environment along the roads.
b)-Use of Clean Fuel and Unleaded Gasoline
It is indicated in the Environmental Protection Program for the Ninth-Five Year and
Planning for 2010 of Shenyang City that, it is greatly encouraged to develop high heat-value
gas sources during the next five years, and some projects (such as Coal Gas Project in West
Shenyang, Hushitai Coal Gas Project, phase I of Shenyang Light Oil Gas Company) will be
implemented.
65



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject  Environmental Impact Assessment
Using Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) as fuel for public buses has been tested in Shenyang
since 1977. It is expected that under the effort of municipal government, more than 50% of
public buses and taxis will use clean fuel (LPG and natural gas) by 2010. In this case, CO
emitted by vehicles will be reduced by 97%, HC by 72% and NOx by 39%.
According to order of Shenyang Municipal Government ( No. 85 [1997]), leaded gasoline
will be prohibited since Nov. 1, 1998 in Shenyang. Meanwhile, SEPA has developed related
regulation to reduce the price of unleaded gasoline and increase that of leaded gasoline, which
can help change users behaviours. Therefore, lead emission from vehicle exhaust is expected
to be eliminated.
c) Vehicle lnspection and Maintenance Program
-A
The current vehicle inspection and maintenance program in Shenyang can not meet the
requirement of the vehicle increase in the future. Thus, a Bus Repair Facility, developed as
one action of the project, is to improve the program. The capacity of the facility will be 1,000
vehicles of major repair after implementation and 1,324 vehicles in 2010 annually.
New regulation of inspection of exhaust emission for MVs is under development by the
Municipal Government. The MVs will not only be inspected annually but also exhaust
emission inspection twice a year conducted by Shenyang Environmental Monitoring Center.
The MVs failed inspection will not be prohibited to travel.
d) Use of Exhaust Cleaning Facility
Since 1995, large amount of investment has been input on the research of high-quality
exhaust cleaning facility nation-wide. It is indicated in the Environmental Protection
Program for the Ninth-Five Year and Planning for 2010 of Shenyang City that by 2010, more
than 50% MV in Shenyang will install effective cleaning facilities, which could reduce CO
and HC by 70%, and reduce NOx by 50%". This program will be implemented together with
the annual inspection and registration procedure, based on cooperation of EPB and Public
Security Bureau. The facility will be paid by the vehicle owner.
e) Eliminate Old Vehicles
Based on investigation, the emission of old vehicles in Shenyang makes up to 20-25% of the
total MV emission. Therefore, these old vehicles must be eliminated by the year of 2001.
f) Environmental Quality Monitoring
The environmental monitoring program is necessary, to ensure the effectiveness of mitigation
measures and respond to environmental issues.
The monitoring will be carried out once a year during construction phase and twice a year
(winter and summer, 7 days each time) during operation phase by Shenyang Environmental
Monitoring Center. Nine sampling locations were selected in Lifu Hospital, Shenyang
University, South Yushan Apartment, No. 107 Middle School, No. 32 Middle School, No.
148 Middle School, the Bus Repair Facility, Dadong Bus Terminal (Figure 5.2.1-1:
construction phase; Figure 5.2.1-2: operation phase). The factors of NOx, CO, HC, SO2
66

TSP, and B(a)P will be monitored in terms of hourly average and daily average
concentrations.
4.2.5 Residual Impact
4.2.5.1 Construction Phase
Mitigation measures mentioned in 4.2.4.1 will be adopted, and the impact of dust and
construction vehicle emission will be reduced to minimum level.
Some sensitive rec.eptors, such as Lifu Hospital, will be impacted by dust in some extent after
mitigation.
A
4.2.5.2 Operation Phase
Due to the adoption of mitigation measures, the CO emission of MV in project corridor will
decrease to 1,246.7 kg/h (by 46.1%), NOx decrease to 125.6 kg/h (by 34.1%) and HC to
175.7 kg/h (48.9%). This is shown in Table 4.2.5-1, and illustrated in Figure 4.2.5-1.

4.3 Noise and Vibration
4.3.1 Methodology
4.3.1.1Traffic Noise Prediction
US FHWA Model, a model of non-continuous linear source, is used for the traffic noise
prediction. The final prediction is modified based on current traffic and related analogical
analysis. Parameters in the model are determined as follows:
*  Proportion of vehicle type, traffic volume and speed: these parameters are shown in 2.4.2
in this report.
*  Road roughness Aodification: the traffic volume is not modified for the prediction,
because the proposed road surface will be asphalt concrete.
*  Road vertical slope modification: the modification value is +2 dB, because the maximum
vertical slope of the proposed roads is 3.0-3.5%.
*  Noise attenuating modification: 0-10 dB is used as noise attenuating modification based
on different cases (e.g. 3 dB for 40-60% building obstruction; 5 dB for 70-90%).
*  Height of noise source: the average height of noise source is 1.0 m.
The other parameters, such as modification of road structure, are subject to Appendix El-
El.1 and E1.2 of JLT 005-96 (Environmental Impact Proposed Specification of National
Highway Construction Project, Jan. 1 1997).
Because the model is only available for noise prediction in open field, the modification of
noise source height due to high buildings is not considered. An analogical analysis was
carried out for high buildings and resulted in a necessary building mixed noise and road
pavement reflection noise. In the analogical analysis, a 18-floor high building was selected.
Noise levels were monitored for every floor and compared with the predicted noise levels by
the model. The difference between the levels are used as modification. Therefore, a
modification was made. Detailed modification values for noise prediction of high buildings
are shown in Table 4.3.1-1.

The model is used to predict the traffic noise level and environmental noise level during peak
hour. The traffic volume in night-time is assumed as 1/8 of the daily average traffic volume.
The prediction includes noise levels along the roads and sensitive receptors with and without
the project during day-time (6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.) and night-time (10:00 p.m. to 6:00
a.m.).

4.3.1.2 Vibration Prediction
An analogical analysis, similar to the analysis of noise height modification, is used for
vibration prediction. Vibration monitoring sites were selected along existing roads (at grade
and elevated). The vibration level and the traffic volume were listed to show the change
principle of vibration. The analysis results are used for determination of vibration level
prediction.
4.3.2 Noise Source Inventory
Noise Source Inventory of Construction Equipment
Numerous types of machinery are used or road construction. Based on the information
provided by SPO, following equipment will be used for the project (Table 4.3.2-1). Because
the concrete and asphalt concrete used for the construction are produced in suburbs of the
city, no concrete-making machinery is listed.

43.3 Noise Impact Analysis
4.3.3.1 Construction Phase
Table 4.3.3-1 provides noise levels of construction machinery at certain distances based on
the source levels in Table 4.3.2-1. Within 50 m of the construction site, although the noise
levels of all construction machinery listed in the table are under the standard in day-time,
only the noise level of impact drill is under the standard in night-time. However, based on the
69

Vertical Distribution of Noise Level
The vertical distribution of noise level (5 m  away the road shoulder, 50 m  height ) is
presented in Table 4.3.3-3 and Table 4.3.3-4. It can be summarized that all noise level under
50 m (vertical) with/without the project in day-time and night-time exceed the standards, in
71



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject          Environmental Impact Assessment
which, the maximum exceedance of standard with the project in day-time is 15.7 dB and the
maximum with the project in night-time is 20.1 dB; and the maximum exceedance of
standard without in day-time is 12.1 dB and the maximum without in night-time is 17.0 dB.
The noise impact is most serious along Nanwu Road and the impact is less along Beiyi Road
and Pangjiang Street. Based on the view of vertical distribution, the noise level is highest on
14.3 to 22.7 m (five floor to eight floor). In the view of vertical distribution of noise level, the
noise levels of the fifth to eighth floor (14.3 m-22.7 m height) are highest among the
predictions. Table 4.3.3-5 shows the maximum and standard-exceedance of noise levels
within 50 m height. Table 4.3.3-6 and Table 4.3.3-7 present the noise levels of ser.itive
receptors.

Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject  Environmental Impact Assessment
Prediction of Exceedance of Standard
Figure 4.3.3-3 and Figure 4.3.3-4 show the noise predictions of the road sections, the Bus
Repair Facility and the sensitive receptors. Table 4.3.3-5 shows the predictions of in road
sections, Bus Repair Facility, and Bus Terminal in Dadong in 2010. It can be concluded as
follows:
* Nanwu Road to Fangxing Square
This road section will be elevated. The predicted values of noise level are 16.3 dB more
than the day-time standard and 21.3 dB more than the night-time standard. The sensitive
receptors along- this section are South Yushan Apartment, Tielu Middle School and the
Day Care Centef of Commercial Bureau.
* Beiyi-Lianhe Road and Pangjiang Street
These road sections will be at grade. The predicted values of noise level are 6.4-19.1 dB
more than the day-time standard and 11.2-19.1 dB more than the night-time standard. The
sensitive receptors along Biyi Road are Xinggong No.1 Preliminary School, Baogong
No.1 Preliminary School, Lifu Hospital. The sensitive receptors along Lianhe Road are
Xita Preliminary School, Shenyang University, No. 28 Middle School. No.107 Middle
School is a sensitive receptor located along Pangjiang Street.
* Gonghe Interchange and Fangxing Square Interchange
The values of noise prediction are much higher than the related standard around the
interchanges. The maximum of prediction is 24.6 dB more than day-time standard, and
the maximum of prediction is 29.3 dB more than night-time standard. Northeast
Architectural Design Institute, Liaoning Hydro Power Institute and Northeast Electricity
Management Bureau.
* Tianguang Street, Shenzhou Road, Sanjing Street, Sanjing Street, Zhulin Road,
Helongjiang Street, Nanjingnan Street
The noise predictions in day-time and night-time for the residents of the first row of the
buildings in 2010 exceed the standard. The maximum standard-exceedance in day-time is
6.8 dB, and the maximum in nightOtime is 11.3 dB in Nanjingnan Street. Nanjingnan
Street is the south exit of inner bus and truck of urban city. The traffic volume will
increase due to the widening of this section.
* Bus Repair Facility, Bus Terminal in Dadongmen
The noise predictions of the Bus Repair Facility are under the standard. The noise
prediction in day-time of Dadongmen Bus terminal is 4.9 dB higher than the standard, and
7.7 dB higher than the standard in night-time.

Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject                    Environmental Impact Assessment
*   Sensitive Receptors
It can be concluded that all noise predictions of South Yushan Apartment exceed the
standard with and without the project; the noise is serious of the fifth floor of Tielu
Middle School with the project in night-time (18.9 to 25.5 dB higher than the standard);
the noise predictions of the Day Care Center of Commercial Bureau are 20 dB higher than
the standard. The noise predictions of Lifu Hospital, 107 Middle School, Shenyang
University and No.107 Middle School with the project in day-time and night-time exceed
the standards. Table 4.3.3-6 and Table 4.3.3-7 show the prediction of the sensitive
receptors.
It can be concluded tlhat the noise impact on the elevated road section, interchanges and some
section  of Beiyi Road  and  Lianhe Road  is serious according  to  the analysis of noise
predictions.

Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject  Environmental Impact Assessment
4.3.4 Noise Mitigation
4.3.4.1 Construction Phase
The implementation period will be 4 years. The proposed Subproject includes road widening
and viaduct over existing surface road. Therefore, construction activities will impact the
environment surrounding the construction sites. Although it is inevitable that noise will be
generated due to construction activities, the impact of noise on the surrounding areas can be
mitigated in some extent. All contractors must obey the noise prevention and control items of
Shenyang Environmental Noise Management Regulation. Meanwhile, after consultation with
SPO, recommended mitigation measures for this project are as follows.
*  Based on Itern`30 of National Environmental Noise Pollution Prevention Regulation
(valid since March 1 1997), noisy construction will be prohibit in the area of noise
sensitive buildings in night-time (10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.), unless the construction is
emergent repair or accident. The construction with special process will be done in night-
time with the permission issued by related government and environmental agency. All
construction in night-time will be noticed to the nearby residents by the contractor.
* Low noise machinery or machinery with noise shielding and absorption will be used. Lifu
Hospital, Day care center of Commercial Bureau, and South Yushan Apartment will be
protected carefully with noise shielding (2 m height, 60 m length) during construction
phase. The construction machinery will be inspected and maintained once a month.
* All contractors will rationalize work schedule and siting, keeping noisy operations away
from sensitive receptors. Temporary enclosure structures will be applied to sites to reduce
extremely high noise emissions. For instance, the construction of Fanxing Square
Interchange will take about 6 months, which will impact the institutions 40-50 m
surrounding the site, such as North-east Electricity Management Bureau and North-east
Architecture Design Institute.
- The construction components used for Nanwu viaduct, Gonghe Interchange, and
Fangxing Square Interchange will be prefabricated and transported to the construction
-   sites.
- If the on-site monitoring result exceeds the standard, Shenyang Environmental
Monitoring Center will report to Shenyang Project Office imnmediately. Shenyang Project
Office will stop the construction.
4.3.4.2 Operation Phase
From the prediction of the noise, it can be concluded that the noise level will exceed the
standard in both construction and operation phases. The environment will be impact seriously
along the proposed viaduct and surface roads. Hence, it is necessary to reduce traffic noise as
much as possible by all feasible means, such as proper planning, mitigation and management.
Proper Planning
* The distance between the first row of buildings and the proposed roads redline must not
be less than 20 m and incorporate vegetation buffer in the newly developed and
redeveloped areas;
* The first row of buildings along the roads will not be assigned sensitive uses such as
schools, hospitals and day care centers;
81



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject  Environmental Impact Assessment
* Planned internal structure of residential buildings is a means to prevent direct noise
impact on people, by allocating bathrooms and kitchens to be on the side facing the roads;
* The first row of buildings will parallel the road to mitigate traffic noise impact on the next
rows of buildings.
Mitigation
Mitigation measures will be taken for the residents and sensitive receptors along the roads.
Figure 4.3.4-la and Figure 4.3.4-lb show the mitigation measures and the comparison of
noise levels before and after mitigation.
* Sound Absorption]3arrier (SAB) on Nanwu viaduct
Transparent SAB (100 m length, 5 m height) will be installed on east side of the viaduct
in front of South Yushan Apartment and Day Care Center of Commercial Bureau.
Transparent SAB (100 m length, 5 m height) will be installed on both side of the viaduct
from Shengli Street to Zhenxing Street.
The foundation of the SAB (100 m length, 5 m height) will be built while the construction
of the viaduct. The SAB will reduce noise by 10-15 dB.
* Double Glazed Window (DGW)
The sensitive receptors, such as Tielu Middle School, South Yushan Apartment, Day Care
Center of Commercial Bureau, and the residents in the first row of the building will be
protected by DGW. The indoor noise will be reduced by 20-25 dB with DGW. 56,800 m2
of DGW will be installed.
The mitigation measures and the cost estimate for the sensitive receptors and the residents
in the first row of the building along the road secfions are shown in Table 4.3.4-1 and
Table 4.3.4-2.
* Air Conditioner (AC)
It is cold in winter in Shenyang. Most of the residential windows have two layers. But in
summer, residents have to open the windows. In order to mitigate the noise, especially in
summer, air conditioners will be installed for schools, hospitals, day care center and
residential buildings. Details are shown in Table 4.3.4-1 and Table 4.3.4-2.
Management
* The vehicle noise emission will be monitored annually based on noise standard. Curtailed
inspection will be undertaken on road for MVs. The vehicle that can not meet the standard
must be maintained or changed by silencer.
* Horn prohibition of MV will be carried out based on the Notice of Horn Prohibition of
MV wvithin First Ring Road in Shenyang issued by Municipality in July 1995.
* Heavy-duty vehicles (trucks) are prohibited to travel along the proposed viaducts since
April 5 1998, according to Notice on Readjustment of Truck Volume within the Second
82



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject        Environmental Impact Assessment
Ring Road in Shenyang (July, 1995) issued by Shenyang Transportation Commnand
Center.
* The noise barriers and pavement will be maintained periodically.

4.3.5 Residual Impact
4.3.5.1 Construction Phase
When mitigation is carried out in construction phase, most noise levels of the sensitive
receptors outside the redline will exceed the standards.
4.3.5.2 Operation Phase
Table 4.3.5-1 shows the residual impact along road sections during operation phase. The
conclusion is as follows:
* Nanwu Road to Fangxing Square (viaduct)
After the implementation of the noise barrier, DGW and AC on the residential buildings
along the section of the viaduct, the predicted values (1 m outside the window) of residual
impact will be 6.7 dB higher than the standard in day-time, 11.3 dB higher in night-time.
However, after the implementation of the mitigation, the indoor noise level will be 56.7
dB in day-time, and 46.3 dB in night-time, which can be tolerable by the residents.
D Beiyi-Lianhe Road and Pangjiang Street(at grade)
After the implementation of mitigation, the values of residual impact will be under the
day-time standard.
* Gonghe Interchange and Fangxing Square Interchange
Although mitigation measures, such as DGW and AC, are used, the maximum value of
noise residual impact on the sides of Gonghe Interchange is still 2.8 dB higher than the
standard in day-time, and 6.8 dB higher in night-time; and the maximum value of noise
residual impact on the sides of Fangxing Square Interchange is still 4.6 dB higher than the
standard in day-time, and 9.3 dB higher in night-time.

Table 4.3.5-2 shows the residual impact of sensitive receptors during operation phase. It can
be concluded that: after the mitigation, the residual impact on sensitive receptors exceeds the
standard. The noise level lm outside the window after mitigation is 5-16 dB higher than the
standard in day-time, and 9.4-15.5 dB higher in night-time. However, the indoor levels are
48-55 dB in day-time and 37.7-44.4 dB in night-time. For instance, the indoor noise level
after mitigation will be 37.7 dB, which is under the standard.
In general, although the noise levels 1 m outside the window exceed the standards (55 dB in
day-time, 45 dB in night-time), the indoor noise levels can basically be under 50 dB, which
can be tolerable by the residents.

4.3.6 Vibration
In order to find the change principle of vibration, an analogical analysis (as same as the
analysis for noise) is used for vibration prediction. 5 vibration monitoring points are selected
along Chorrgshan Road (elevated), and Nanwu Road (at grade). The analysis can be
concluded as follows:
*  The VLeq in the day-time is higher than that of in the night due to heavy traffic during
day-time.
*  The more volume of LDV and MDV, the larger the VLeq will be.
*  The VLeq of the elevated road will be similar to that of the surface road, if their traffic
volumes are at tbe same level.
*  The VLeq will be under related standards (day-time standard: 75dB, night-time: 72dB), if
the traffic volume of HDV and MDV is less than 1,700.
The results shown in Table 4.3.6-1 indicate that the vibration level is under the standard
(GB 10070-88).

The rougher the road surface becomes due to wear over time, the stronger the vibration. In
addition, vibration will increase if changes occur to fleet composition and speed pattern, e.g.,
a greater proportion of heavy-duty and medium-duty vehicles. Mitigation measures are
recommended as follows:
*  To prevent and reduce traffic vibration during the operation phase to meet the requirement
for various zones prescribed by the Environmental Vibration Standard for Urban Areas
(GB 10070-88), attention will be paid to road structure and efficient road and traffic
management.
*  Restrict timely freight vehicle traffic in the urban area since April 5,1998 according to the
Notice on Freight Vehicle Traffic Flow Arrangement within the Second Ring Road
issued by Shenyang Traffic Steering Committee on April 1, 1998;
4.4 Sunshine
4.4.1 Methodology
In this stnshine obstruction assessment, full-window sunshine time ( AT ) was selected for
assessing sunshine level. This is the duration of sunshine from the beginning to the end of
frill-window sunshine exposure. Considering that the sunshine standard is currently not
91



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject         Environmental Impact Assessment
available in the existing national environmental standard series, the building design standard
was used as the assessment standard ( listed in Table 1.3.2-5).
The winter solstice (December 22) is the day with the shortest sunshine time over the year,
hence, it was selected for assessing the sunshine level.
The assessed locations were the roadside rooms on the first floor with windows parallel to the
road center line.
4.4.2 Inventory 6f Exposure Areas
According to the propqsed route of the project and the locations of the viaducts, the impacted
sections include the viaduct in Nanwu Road and the alternative viaduct in Beiyi Road. The
rooms on the first floor of the buildings along both sides of the road with viaduct are taken as
exposure areas.
4.4.3 Impact Analysis
4.4.3.1 Construction Phase
During most part of construction phase, there will be little sunshine obstruction to the
roadside buildings. The temporary barriers, used for sound and dust isolation, will cause
sunshine obstruction. This obstruction is similar to that of a viaduct in operation phase.
Therefore, assessment is only necessary for operation phase.
4.4.3.2 Operation Phase
The sunshine obstruction on the roadside buildings after completion of the viaduct is
predicted in Table 4.4-1.
Table 4.4-1   Predicted Full-Window Sunshine Time and
Current Sunshine Time for Sensitive Locations of The Viaduct

Note: DM- Distancefrom the viaduct center line to the edge of the roadside building;
H - Valid sunshine obstruction height;
y - Room zimuth.
It is can be seen from above comparison that the viaduct in Nanwu Road will have sunshine
obstruction impact on the roadside buildings. The sunshine time of 2.6-3.9 hours can meet the
Class 3 standard ( 1-2 hours, a general standard for residential area ) but can not meet the
Class 1 standard for day care center ( 5-6 hours).
Nanwu Road is a east-west oriented road, and only the buildings on the north side will be
impacted in terms of sunshine time. The viaduct of Nanwu Road is 2.7 km long, with shops,
restaurants, day care centers and residential buildings located along it. The most impacted
rooms will be those on the first floor, while the sunshine time increases at 30-40 minuttes for
92



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject   Environmental Impact Assessment
each floor higher. As a result, no sunshine obstruction will occur for rooms on the 4th floor or
higher. Totally 14 residential buildings (with 1500 residents ) on the north side of Nanwu
Road that will be impacted. There were two day care centers here. However, the Jixian Day
care center has already resettled to other place, and the day care center of Commercial Bureau
is 30 m away from the road. Therefore, the viaduct will have little impact on it.
In general, an average reduction of 1.2 -2.9 hours of sunshine time will occur on the first floor
rooms of the north-side buildings. Nevertheless, the full-window sunshine time will still
remain 3 - 4 hours, which can meet Class 2 standard.
For the altemative- viaduct of Beiyi Road, the full-window sunshine time will be 2.5 hours,
which can meet Claass 3 standard.
4.4.4 Mitigation
4.4.4.1 Construction Phase
All material stores for construction will be installed in the north side of the residential
buildings. All construction machinery will be operated as far as possible away the windows of
the first floor of resident buildings, because the enclosing barrier for the noise will obstruct
the sunshine.
4.4.4.2 Operation Phase
If the setback of proposed new buildings along the road is 10 m, the sunshine level can be
improved to Class 1;
Choosing proper room azimuth, increasing the vertical height of windows and raising the
bottom of windows;
Functional planning for buildings: Nurseries, day care centers, sanitariums and greenhouses,
which require longer sunshine will be located in buildings with Class 1 sunshine level, or on
higher floors to avoid sunshine obstruction. Rooms for offices, public buildings and general
workshops can be located in buildings with Class 2 sunshine level. Rooms used for general
services can be located at roadside with relatively low sunshine level or on lower floors.
4.4.5 Residual Impact
4.4.5.1 Construction Phase
There is no sunshine obstruction impact during the construction phase.
4.4.5.2 Operation Phase
It is inevitable that sunshine on existing buildings, which are close to the road, will be
impacted by the project. However, the sunshine level for residential areas can still meet Class
-3 standard. Recommendation is provided for increased setbacks for new construction along
the road to minimize the potential effects of reduced sunshine.

Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject  Environmental Impact Assessment
4.5 Hydrology and Water Quality
The proposed Lianhe Road will be overpass an artificial canal, the North Canal. The water are
mainly come from Hunhe River. The Canal receives 45,000 tons sewage every day. In the
early 1998, most of sewage will be intercepted according to urban master plan of the city.
Then, the function of the Canal will be tourism.
4.5.1 Methodology
The method for this assessment used simple runoff equations combined with the results of
water equality monitoring on existing viaducts to calculate the total discharges.
A
4.5.2 Impact Analysis
Although the pollutant on proposed viaducts can enter surface water bodies directly while
other contaminants are washed to rivers via runoff, the water body within 5-25m under the
ground has already been polluted by industrial wastewater. The industrial water and drinking
water in the city are come from the water under 50m. Hence, the construction of the project
will have no further impact for underground water body in the city.
4.5.2.1 Construction Phase
The waste water discharge during construction phase includes domestic sewage of the
workers, maintenance water discharge from concrete component parts and cooling water
discharge. The waste water during construction phase will be discharged into municipal sewer
system.
4.5.2.2 Operation Phase
During operation phase, the increase of traffic volume and speed will result in the increase of
pollutants in surface runoff. However, compared with the pollutants in industrial and
domestic sewage, this water pollution from the traffic is too small to cause obvious impact on
surface water environment.
During winter time, some NaCI will be used to clean the snow on viaducts and interchanges.
But because there is not much snow, and thawed water will be diluted within rain water pipe
system. Hence, there is almost no impact on the river.
SS in the surface runoff is less, therefore, there is little impact on the North Canal.
Truck accident will cause somewhat leakage of hazardous materials on the overpass of
Lianhe Road. Necessary response will be considered for the accident.
94



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject   Environmental Impact Assessment
4.5.3 Mitigation
4.5.3.1 Construction Phase
* The domestic sewage of the workers during construction phase will be discharged into
municipal drainage system through public toilet on street or temporary toilet or will be
transported to farm land and used as fertilizer.
* The runoff of the rain will be discharged into municipal drainage system.
* The waste water collection facility will be installed in the construction site when North
Canal section of Lianhe Road is under construction. Therefore the rain can go into
municipal drainage system through outlets.
* Construction m*hinery will be maintained periodically to avoid fuel leakage.
4.5.3.2 Operation Phase
* Drainage outlet will be designed along both sides of the roads and viaducts to avoid water
accumulation on the road surface.
* Emergency program is to avoid fuel or hazardous material leakage pollution on North
Canal and other water ways. In the case of accident, Shenyang Environmental Protection
Bureau, Public Security Bureau and Transportation Agency will be in charge of treatment.
* Any transportation of hazardous material will be approved by municipal transportation
agency. The vehicle with hazardous materials must have license issued by the agency. The
vehicle must be installed fire prevention facility and painted with hazardous signs. Man
powers, tractors and motorcycles are not prohibited to transport any hazardous materials.
4.5.4 Residual Impact
4.5.4.1 Construction Phase
If the mitigation measures mentioned can be carried out properly, waste water discharge of
the project will have no impact on the surface water environrnient.
4.5.4.2 Operation Phase
The water pollution from the traffic during operation phase is too small compared with the
pollutants in industrial and domestic sewage. Therefore, no further impact will exist on
surface water environment.
4.6 Terrestrial Environment
4.6.1  Methodology
Since the project is to be constructed within the urban build-up area, the associated terrestrial
environment only includes vegetation along the roadsides. Site investigation was used to
identify the impact of the project on roadside vegetation.
95



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject        Environmental Impact Assessment
4.6.2 Impact Analysis
Investigation shows that there are some on street parks in Huigong Square (Lianhe Road),
Fangxing Square(Nanwu Road), and Longiiang square (Helongjiang Street). The existing
roadside vegetation are shown in Table 4.6-1.

The vegetation will be damaged and lose its function only during the construction phase.
Therefore, mitigation measures are needed.
4.6.3 Mitigation
* The contractor must protect the existing vegetation outside the redline to avoid any damage
by construction. If the vegetation damages, it must be replanted to compensate.
* The area of vegetation must be kept not less than previous area. In some sections, the area
of green space will even increase. For instance, one 3 m wide green belt will be
constructed in Beiyi Road, two 3.5 m (or two 1.5 m) belts in Lianhe Road, two 3 m belts
in Pangjiang Street, and two 2 m belts in Nanwu Road. The area of the new greenbelt is to
be 99,396 m2. In general, 23.7 km of vegetation will be planted along the project, including
9A km along Beiyi-Lianhe Road, 4.0 km along Jianshe-Nanwu Road, 2.0 km along
Pangjiang Street, 1.7 km along Nanjing Street, 1.0 km along Zhujiang Street, 2.5 km along
Sanjing Street, 1.3 km along Helongjiang Street, 0.9 km of Shenzhou Road and 1.2 km
along Tianguang Street. In addition, 20,000 km2 of trees will be planted around the
propose Bus Repair Facility.
4.6.4 Residual Impact
Table 4.6.4-1 shows the project impact on vegetation and restoration by mitigation measures.
It can be seen that due to mitigation measures, those damaged green areas will be restored,
with additional 23,915 n2 lawn and 2,366 trees (amount to additional 28,647 m2 green areas).
These will provide the city with better views, as well as dust control and noise mitigation.

4.7 Socio-economic Components
4.7.1 Methodology
The assessment of socio-economic component is a statistical analysis based on site survey,
which includes:
* The site survey is focus on the distribution of residential, cultural & educational,
conmnercial & service zones and enterprises & institutions within 200 m along the road.
* The population density, land use and resettlement within 200 m is investigated and
calculated.
* Further investigo4ion and analysis are made for sensitive receptors, such as entertainment,
day care center and hospital.
* The recommendation and mitigation are presented in this assessment.
4.7.2 Impact Analysis
4.7.2.1Construction Phase
The enclosing time of road construction will be about 12 months. Therefore, it is unavoidable
to affect the person trip in different extent.
Impact on Pedestrian, Bicycle Rider and Bus Passenger
It is necessary to guarantee the smooth traffic in urban city and to ensure the safety of
pedestrians and bicycles across intersections. However, the proposed project will be built in
urban area of the city, the road construction will inevitably impact the pedestrians and
bicycles.
Based on the site survey, the person trips of the pedestrians and bicycles will be delayed 20
minutes to 2 hours due to road construction.. The enclosing or semi-enclosing time of the
road construction will be about 12 months. Therefore, buses, bicycle riders and pedestrians
will travel on other roads. For example, during the construction of Beiyi Road(at grade), most
pedestrians and bicycles will travel on the distributors in the residential zones on the sides of
the road, the bus routes will also be moved to the parallel roads. The new Gonghe Interchange
will be built parallel to the existing bridge. The bicycles can use the bridge and will not be
affected by the construction of the new interchange.
Impact on Daily Life
Because of the construction of the roads, the shops near the road side will be affected in some
extent. The shopping in these shops are not convenient. The trips for employees of the
institutions will also be difficult.
Based on the survey, 12 shops will be affected by the construction of the roads, in which
Shierxian Vegetable Wholesale Market will have more impact. Some vendors are difficult to
enter or exit the Market of vegetable wholesale.
97



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject          Environmental Impact Assessment
The construction of road widening or missing link connection (such as Shenzhou Road,
Tianguang Street, Sanjing Street, etc.) will have less impact on daily life of the residents
along the roads.
Im. pact on Hospitals
It is indicated that 8 Hospitals will be affected by the construction of the roads according to
the survey, in which 240 patients will have directed impact. It is difficult for the pedestrians
to cross the street.
4.7.2.2 Operation Phase
The implement time of the project will be 5 years. Therefore, the impact on residents,
enterprises and green space along the roads is unavoidable. The impact can be concluded as
follows:
Impact on Residents and Communities
Some sections of existing Beiyi Road and Lianhe Road are in poor condition. No bus routes
operate on these two roads. The operation of the roads will provide better road condition and
two bus routes for the residents. 5,099 residents lived along Beiyi Road and 21,750 along
Lianhe Road will get benefit from the road implementation. The bus station will be installed
near the existing institutions, such as Shenyang University, which will provide convenience
and safety.
High-density residential areas are located along the proposed roads. 35,984 households with
160,180 people will be impacted. Table 4.7.2-1 shows the distribution of residents along the
proposed roads.
The new roads will satisfy the requirements of MV, however, the newly built transportation
facilities will block pedestrians and bicycles at the same time.       -

Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject  Environmental Impact Assessment
Impact on the Establishments and Institutions
New roads operation will benefit the establishments along the road side. Smooth traffic also
will be good the development of the institutions.
Impact on thie Markets
On the preferred alignments, there are 7 fairly big markets for vegetables, fruits and basic
commodities, which are mainly located in Huanggu, Heping and Shenhe District. There are
6,000 in the peak marketing time period in Xinxing Market located in Nanwu Road; 10,000
in Pangjiang Market in Kaixiang Street; 3,000 in Dadong Vegetable & Fruit Wholesales
Market in Beihai Str,eet; 5,000 in Meat Wholesales Market in Tawan Street; 500 in Zhulin
Market in Pangjiang Street; 3,000 in Automobile Market in Wenyi Road. Shenyang
Vegetables & Fruits Wholesales in Harbin Road, with 40,000 shoppers during morning
shopping peak, is one of the biggest markets in the urban city. The widening of above road
sections will affect the markets mentioned.
Impact on the Handicapped Persons
There will be a viaduct, an on-ramp, a down-ramp and two interchanges. The gradual slope
has be designed for the intersections of the proposed roads, such as, Tianguang Street,
Shenzhou Road, Sanjing Street. The design will provide convenience and safety for blinds
and other handicapped persons.
Impact on the Development of Community
There is no bus route and few Commercial establishment in the shanty of Beiyi Road. The
proposed project will benefit the living quality, community environment and the economic
development.
Summary
According to the survey, it is obvious that the operation of the new roads will be positive to
the development of industry, commerce, finance, information and service. The employment
rate will increase because of batter traffic. The living quality of the people will also be
improved.
The new roads, especially the viaducts, not only provide better traffic, but also nice scenes for
people.
4.7.3 Mitigation
4.7.3.1Construction Phase
* Trees will be protected during construction to avoid damage.
* When carrying out construction in front of schools, the construction responsible unit will
appoint a specific person or persons to guide the pupils travel through the construction
site;
99



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject     Environmental Impact Assessment
* Traffic management during construction phase was designed in the preliminary design of
the new roads. When the big intersection and interchange are in construction, traffic
management will concentrate on traffic safety. MVs and NMVs will be separated, and
pedestrians will be shown to use other distributors nearby the road in construction or the
roads in the community.
* In order to protect the pedestrians during construction of Gonghe Interchange and
Fangxing Square Interchange, some protection facility, such as safety board, will be used
to prevent any injury cause by the falling of construction materials or facilities.
4.7.3.2 Operation Phase
Although the Subproje&t will bring smooth and safe traffic in the urban city, the living quality
of the people, commercial activities and the green space along the roads will be impact to
some extent. Relevant mitigation measures are considered.
* The 7 markets affected by the roads (5 of them are retail markets) will be resettled to
nearby area or salesroom buildings based on the basic policy of traffic management in
Shenyang.
* In order to ensure the safety of person trip, barriers will be installed on viaduct.
* When the design was developed in early stage, the engineers proposed to enclose the road
section (Lianhe Road) for some traffic consideration and construct overpasses for
pedestrians and NMVs. But this option will affect getting in and out Shenyang vegetable
& Fruit Wholesales Market. The major transportation vehicles in this wholesales market
are man-powered, it is difficult to accept the option for the staff and users of the market.
After further consultation, the engineers kept an approach in front of the market and
install specific NMVs zebra in this intersection.
* The barriers will be installed to separate MVs and NMVs to improve traffic. However, it
is not convenient for pedestrians to cross the street. The distance between two pedestrian
zebra will not be longer than 150 m to facility the pedestrian crossing street. Meanwhile,
Zebra lines will be installed in front of the school gate(e.g. Shenyang University) and
community entrance. Pedestrian signals will be set in the intersections with high volume
of some of the roads. Figure 4.7.3-1 shows the locations of the 11 zebra lines.
* In order to prevent the pedestrian safety of crossing street under the construction of
Gonghe Interchange and Fangxing Square Interchange, prevention barriers will be used on
the viaduct.

As described by resettlement policy and compensation standard in Resettlement Action Plan
(RAP), residents can enjoy better housing, quiet surroundings, good air quality, and full pubic
utilities in the resettlement sites. However, the resettlement sites in the suburb are not fully
developed and there will be some inconvenience with transport, recreational activities, and
uneasy feelings about the new environment. In order to give more convenience to the resettled
residents, the rehabilitation areas are selected based on following principles:
* The rehabilitation area will be near resettled residential area.
* Besides the selected rehabilitation areas, the resettle residents have the right to select new
house in existing residential areas in the urban area(Table 4.8-2).

4.9 Alternative Analysis
In the early stage of option screening, another option besides above two options was
considered. This option included elevated sections, e.g. Beiyi Road, Nanwu Road, Wenyi
Road, Pangjiang Street, Beihai Street and Baogong Street.
However, there are three parks along the existing Wenyi Road. The proposed alignment on
Wenyi Road (elevated or at grade) will occupy the land of the parks, damage large amount of
existing green space, and affect public entertainment in the parks. Shenyang Project Office,
associated with Shenyang Engineering Design Institute, decided to use Wenhua Road instead
of Wenyi Road to reduce environmental impact on the existing vegetation and public living.
Meanwhile, there will be a lot of resettlement on the alignment of Beihai Street (widening or
elevated). Hence, this section will be postponed to be constructed. The decision was also
made to use the surface road option to replace the viaduct option for Pangjiang Street and
Beiyi Road. The alternative for Beiyi Road ( surface road) is a viaduct. In order to describe
the environmental impact of surface road option and viaduct option, an analysis is made for
Beiyi Road. The environmental impact of the current option and the alternative is compared
in Table 2.1.3-1.
It can be concluded that the current option is better than the alternatives with the
consideration of environmental impact.

The above organization chart shows that during the construction phase three independent and
inter-related organizations will be responsible to protect the surrounding environment of the
construction sites, in addition to the periodical environment monitoring done by SEMCS.
On one hand, the contractor must arrange the EP responsible person to get EP training by
SEPB prior to the construction to ensure the strong enforcement in the light of the
environmental protection laws and regulations and this EAP during the construction phase.
On the other hand, the Project Office will employ supervision engineers. They will inspect,
with simple instruments such as noise-meter, the routine EP work done by the construction
units. The supervision engineer is authorized to suspend the construction violating the
environment regulations and report to the Project Office promptly his own findings and
complains from the urrounding residents. Meanwhile, the patrol inspectors from the SEIB
will accept complains through hot line in 24 hours, conduct periodical patrol in the
construction sites and make immediate response to the illegal activities in the site.

During the operation phase, project surrounding environment will be managed through
periodical monitoring and public complain handling. The following chart shows the roles of
the responsible organizations.
The Project Office and Shenyang EPB will review and update mitigation measures (if
necessary, together with the transportation authority) for the operation phase according to the
monitoring results and the public complains reported.
5.1.8 Staff
The SPO will have two staff assigned specially for environmental management, e.g. daily
environmental affairs, public complaints and emergency response.
A specific environmental protection division will be established in the Bus Repair Facility
and responsible for all environmental protection in the facility. There will be 8 staffs in the
division, including one division chief, three technical staffs, three monitoring staffs, etc.
5.1.9 Technical Training Programs
It is critical to train contractors who will be involved in the construction and operation of the
project. Without appropriate environmental awareness and knowledge and skill s required for
the implementation of the mitigation measures, it would be difficult for contractors to
107



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject               Environmental Impact Assessment
implement effective environmental protection measures. Meanwhile, it is also important to

5.2 Environmental Monitoring Plan
Environmental monitoring is normally undertaken during both construction and operation
phases to ensure mitigation measures effectively, to respond to unanticipated environmental
concerns at an early stage and to determine the accuracy of impact predictions. Specific
monitoring programs are presented as well as responsibilities for the collection and analysis
of data and reporting requirements in this section.
The purpose of the environmental monitoring plan are to: evaluate the effectiveness of
mitigation measures; respond to unanticipated environmental impacts when the project is
under construction; make regulations and improve traffic management and environmental
controls, based on .onitoring data.
Besides the environmental monitoring undertaken by the environmental protection division of
the Bus Repair Facility, all the environmental monitoring will be undertaken by SEMC.
5.2.1 Sampling Locations
5.2.1.1Construction Phase
Six sampling sites will be selected along the proposed roads for noise, vibration and air
quality (Lifu Hospital, Shenyang University, South Yushan Apartment, No. 107 Middle
School, No. 32 Middle School, No. 148 Middle School), and three sampling sites will be
selected for surface water (Lianhe Road section of North Canal, Day Care Center of
Commercial Bureau, No.107 Middle School).
One sampling site 1 m outside each building nearest the Bus Repair Facility and the Bus
Terminal will be selected for noise, vibration and air quality, and three sampling sites will be
selected for surface water in the construction site. The locations of these sampling sites are
shown in Figure 5.2.1-1.
The environmental monitoring duration will depend on the duration of construction. 6 9
months is normally estimated.
5.2.1.2 Operation Phase
The sampling sites along the roads and in the Bus Repair Facility for noise, vibration and air
quality in operation phase will be same as those of in construction phase (Figure 5.2.1-2).
The duration of the monitoring will be two years. It is not necessary to monitor the surface
water in the operation phase anymore. However, the monitoring parameters of the Bus Repair
Facility in operation phase is different from those of in construction phase (Table 5.2.2-2),
and the monitoring in operation phase will be carried out with the whole duration of the
operation.
5.2.2 Parameters, Frequency and Duration
Because the pollution in the Bus Repair Facility will be similar to that of the proposed roads,
the monitoring program for the Facility will be the same as that of the proposed roads except
some specific parameters.

6. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Public participation is an important part of EIA, and essential to decision making. It is an
important channel to identify public concerns, evaluate engineering design, propose
mitigation measures, and enhance public consent and support.
6.1 Approach and Methodology
According to the requirement of the World Bank OD4.01 and SEPA, investigations and
public meetings were conducted by three rounds covering enterprises, institutions, service
sectors, residents, schools and day care centers along the road. The first phase of public
participation was conducted through surveys, site visit and meetings with enterprises,
institutions and residents along Beiyi-Lianhe Road, Jianshe-Nanwu Road and Pangjiang
Street for comments ( Nov. 12-Dec. 22, 1996) . The content of the project, major concerns of
EIA and relevant mitigation measures were introduced to them for their opinion.
Additionally, 500 survey forms were disseminated directly to residents, hospitals, schools
and government agencies. During the second phase (Sept. 10-Sept. 30, 1997), the project was
modified considering public opinion. And these modifications were announced to the public
through site visit and meetings, to which the public are very satisfied. The third phase of
public participation (Feb. 23- March 10, 1998) focus on the residents, hospitals and schools
near the Bus Repair Facility, the Bus Terminal and along the Secondary Corridors, such as
Nanjingnan Street, Shenzhou Road, etc. 300 survey forms were disseminated during the third
phase public participation.
6.2 Surveys, Interviews and Public Meetings
Surveys were conducted for area along Beiyi Road, Lianhe Road, Nanwu Road and Pangjiang
Street. The area were on both side of the road extending outward 300 m from the center line.
Totally 124 organizations were surveyed, including government agencies, schools,
enterprises, shops, day care center and residential communities. More than 50 meetings were
held, involving 3,000 people. Among the 500 survey forms, 470 were returned. 90% of
organizations and 86% of individual resident surveyed supported the project. Totally 55
meetings were held, with total participants of 947, in which 815 people supported the project.
The following tables show the results of surveys.

Beziyi Road
Most of the buildings on the south side of Beiyi Road are large and medium-sized industrial
enterprises, which will benefit from the project. Restaurants and shops impacted will either be
reconstructed on site latterly or relocated to Yuhongnanli Community. So the project was
fully accepted. Meanwhile, to the south of Beiyi Road are old flat-house residential areas in
which residents will be resettled to new buildings. About 1400 families will be resettled to
Yuhongnanli Community, which has better environment and improved living condition.
Therefore, no objection opinions to the project too.
PangJiang Street
Only few residents are impacted and will be resettled to Xiyao Community. Therefore, little
objection from the public.
Lianhe Road
The newly-built buildings along the road will not be impacted due to far distance, and most of
those old residential buildings impacted by the project have already been resettled to Xiyao
118



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject   Environmental Impact Assessment
Community, which has better living environment. Hence, the project was accepted by most of
the public surveyed.
Nanwu Road
There existed lots of objection to the road extension and construction of the viaduct due to
noise pollution, sunshine obstruction and inconvenience for commercial activities.
6.3 Main Problems in Sensitive Areas and Solutions
After the minutes 6f public meetings and the survey forms were carefully studied, the mostly
concerned road sections and sensitive receptors together with solutions are summarized in
following sections
6.3.1 Noise Pollution in Nanwu Road
6.3. 1.1 Concern
The main concern of Nanwu Road is noise pollution, which caused nearly half objections
from the institutions and residents surveyed. These objections mainly came from residents
and restaurants along the road.
6.3.1.2 Solution
This concern was reported to SPO. A discussion was subsequently held, participated by staff
of LUCRPO, the design institute and environmental agencies. Finally, decision was made to
install noise barrier in front of the residential buildings and restaurants along the road, and
adopt SAP and DGW . The noise barrier is supposed to reduce noise level by 15-20 dB,
which will basically solve the noise disturbance. DGW and air exchanger will be installed for
the residents with noise level above the standard, which can reduce noise level by more than
20 dB. According to calculation, the noise level cari be limited within the national standard.
After this meeting, the results were reported to the residents with noise level above the
standard, they were satisfied for this solution.
6.3.2 Shenyang Vegetable and Fruit Company
6.3.2.1 Concern
Shenyang Vegetable and Fruit Co. is located by Lianhe Road. It is a major distributing center
of vegetable and fruit for Shenyang, with a daily floating population of 40,000. The main
transportation tools here is man-powered vehicle. The previous design, which will limit
access to the road and leave an overpass for these man-powered vehicles, was absolutely
objected by the Company. The objection was also expressed by returned survey forms.
6.3.2.2 Solution
The concern of Shenyang Vegetable and Fruit Co. was reported to SPO. After extensive
study, the design was modified. The overpass was cancelled, and specific lane was assigned
for man-powered vehicle, which will greatly increase traffic safety. When the new decision
119



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject  Environmental Impact Assessment
was announced, the Company and all customers were very satisfied, and the General Manager
of the company phoned SPO to express their sincere thanks.
6.3.3 Impacts on Customers Flow of Restaurants and Shops
6.3.3.1Concern
The owners of the restaurants and shops along Nanwu Road ( e.g. Yushan Restaurant and
Tiandu Restaurant) considered that the proposed viaduct would result in less customers,
because it will be inconvenient for customers to get down to the surface road from the
viaduct. Hence, the income of these restaurants and shops will decease.
..k
6.3.3.2 Solution
This concern was also reported to SPO, and the design was modified. The new design will
include an up ramp and a down ramp in Heping Square, which will provide great convenience
for customers to visit these restaurants and shops. Meanwhile, additional advertise boards
will be installed for the restaurants and shops to attract more people.
6.3.4 Sunshine Obstruction along Proposed Viaduct
6.3.4. 1 Concern
This concern came from restaurants and a day care center (Yushan Restaurant, Tiandu
restaurant and Day care center of Commercial Bureau) on the north side of Nanwu Road. The
sunshine obstruction will reduce the lightness within restaurants and affect mood of
customers, and especially affect sun-bath of outdoor playing children, according to the nurses.
6.3.4.2 Solution
The restaurants were suggested to do internal decoration for the rooms along the road. Light-
colour curtains could be hung, and the room be lightened. This is supposed to mitigate the
dim feeling.
The actual sunshine obstruction for the day care center occurred only in December and
January. In the other months no sunshine obstruction will occur due to the change of height
angle of the sun. While this period (December to January) is the coldest season in Shenyang,
with an average temperature of -100C. Therefore, there is little outdoor activity for the
children in the day care center due to the cold weather.
6.4   Public Comments on the Construction of the Bus Repair
Facility, the Bus Terminal and the Improvement of Secondary
Corridors
The third phase of public participation was conducted through surveys, site visit and meetings
with enterprises, institutions and residents along the Secondary Corridors and within 300m of
the Bus Repair Facility and the Bus Terminal. 50 communities, including 14,000 households
120



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject     Environmental Impact Assessment
with 46,000 residents; 11 hospitals; 8 schools; 22 shops and 3 markets were covered in the
survey. 12 public meetings (1,000 people) were held and 215 forms were sent and returned.
It indicated in the third phase of public participation that 100% people lived along the
Secondary Corridors were agreed to the improvement. Meanwhile, the public were satisfied
to the construction of the Bus Repair Facility and the Bus Terminal.
6.5 Conclusion
The previous design has been modified several times based on extensive public participation.
The current design-and related environmental mitigation are quite satisfied by public, because
the people s life quality was fully considered together with traffic improvement. Therefore,
the proposed project gets support from public due to public participation procedures.

7. CONCLUSIONS
7.1 Summary of Major Impacts
When the project is completed, the environmental quality will be improved in the city center
due to reduced traffic volume on the other roads and also a higher average speed on these
routes; however, the environment immediately adjacent to the project route will be negatively
impacted with respect to air quality and noise.
7.1.1 Air Quality
The project will imprd*e transportation efficiency in the city center. Traffic will be smooth
and there will be less congestion and less queuing at intersections. It is predicted that, as a
result of the project, the average speed in the city center will increase to 29.8 km/hr from the
current 21.4 km/hr. As the speed improves, the travel time and the emissions from vehicles
will decrease resulting in a net improvement in the overall air quality. However, the traffic
will increase along the proposed roads and the quality of the air will deteriorate. The analysis
of air quality impacts was designed to evaluate these issues. Meanwhile, a Motor Vehicle
Emission Control Strategy will be developed in the LUTP for the air quality in long term.
Specifically, the four major analyses were as follows:
a) Air quality along the roads, with the project;
b) Air quality along the roads, without the project;
c) Air quality in the city center, with the project;
d) Air quality in the city center, without the project.
These analyses were conducted for the year 2010. Air quality impacts along the roads were
predicted using the US EPA CALINE3 model. Background concentrations of the criteria
pollutants were not included in these analyses.
7.1.1.1 Impacts Along the Roads
The air quality impact is most serious within 20 m away the redline of the surface road (30 m
away of the viaduct) , in which the impact of NOx is most serious and the impact of CO, HC
and NO2 are less.
*  Peak Hour Concentration
Nitrogen Oxides (NOx): The maximum concentration with the project at 10 m from the
road side will be 1.03 mg/m3, which will exceed the standard by a factor of 5.87; the
maximum concentration without the project will be 0.92 mg/m3, which will exceed the
standard by a factor of 5.13. The maximum concentration with the project is 12% higher
than that of without the project. The zone of influence will be within 500 m.
Carbon Monoxide (CO): The maximum concentration with the project will be
17.25mg/m3, which will exceed the standard by a factor of 0.73, the maximum
concentration without the project will be 15.05mg/m3, which will exceed the standard by
122



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject  Environmental Impact Assessment
a factor of 0.51. The maximum concentration with the project is 15% higher than that of
without the project. The impact will be within 50 m.
Hydrocarbon (HC): The concentration with or without the project will be under the
standard. However, the maximum concentration with the project is 14% higher than that
of without the project.
Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2): The concentration with or without the project will be under the
standard. However, the maximum concentration with the project is 12% higher than
without.
*  Daily Average C,ncentration
NOx: The maximum concentration with the project will be 0.38 mg/m3, which will
exceed the standard by a factor of 2.8, the maximum concentration without the project
will be 0. 1mg/m3, which will be under the standard. The maximum concentration with the
project is 280 % higher than that of without the project. The zone of influence within
100 m.
CO: The maximum concentration with the project will be 5.59 mg/m3, which will exceed
the standard by a factor of 0.4, the maximum concentration without the project will be
5.04 mg/m3, which will exceed the standard by a factor of 0.26. The maximum
concentration with the project is 11% higher than that of without the project. The zone of
influence will be within 40 m.
HC: The concentration with or without the project will be under the standard. The
maximum concentration with the project is 12% higher than that of without the project.
N02: The concentration with or without the project will be under the standard. The
maximum concentration with the project is 28% higher than without.
In summary, the ambient air pollutant concentrations, particularly NOx are higher alone the
roads with the project than without. However, the project is positive to the whole urban city
according to analysis of following section(7. 1.1.2).
7.1.1.2 Impacts in the City Center
In the feasibility study report of the project, it shows that the annual increase rate of MV fleet
is 7% in the urban city. Based on the prediction in Environmental Quality Report in
Shenyang, 1995, the annual increase rate of pollutant emission will be 16.1%. From the
results of the emission modelling, the exhaust emission of MVs in the urban city in 2010 is
fixed, however, the percentage of emission prediction with the project in the emission of the
whole urban city is higher that the percentage without the project. Hence, the project will
result in heavy exhaust emission of MVs along the project roads. Moreover, from the point
of view of total pollution load, the impact of exhaust emission on the other roads with the
project in the urban city will be less than without, because more traffic is attracted to the other
road after the completion of the project. It was predicted that NOx would be lower by 49.6%,
CO by 31.1%, HC by 45.8% and NO2 by 5%. For instance, the comparison result of with and
without the project for Beier Road (a typical road section out of the project) shows that the
123



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject   Environmental Impact Assessment
concentration of Beier Road with the project is lower that without (CO concentration reduced
by 0.9 mg/mr3, NOx by 0.lmg/m3, HC by 0.6mg/m3, NO2 by 0.01mg/rn3).
All above results demonstrate that the project will help slow down ambient air quality
degradation in the city center.
7.1.2 Noise
7.1.2.1 Impacts Along the Roads
*  The Zone of Influence
.A .
The zone of influence of viaduct with the project in day-time is 50-100 m, more than 100
m in the night; and 20-50 m in day-time, 70-100 m in the night without the project. For
the road at grade, the zone of influence with the project in day-time is 10-80 m, 70-200 m
in the night; and 10-30 m in day-time, 50-100 m in the night without the project. The
noise levels of the fifth to eighth floor is most serious.
*  The Impacts on the Jianshe-Nanwu Road (elevated)
It is predicted that the noise level with the project at 5 m to the redline of the road
exceeded the standard by 6.7 dB in day-time, 11.3 dB in the night-time; and 5.3 dB in
day-time, 10.2 dB in the night-time without the project. The noise level with the project is
1.4 dB higher than that of without the project in day-time, and 1.1 dB in night-time.
-  The Inpacts on Beiyi-Lianhe Road and Pangjiang Street (at grade)
From the prediction, it showed that the noise level Leq with the project exceeded the
standard by 3.5 to 13.8 dB in day-time, 8.3 to 18.2 dB in the night; and 2.7 to 10.2 dB in
day-time, 1.8 to 15.0 dB in the night without the project. The noise level with the project
is 0.8 to 3.6 dB higher than that of without the project in day-time, and 3.2 to 6.5 dB in
night-time.
7.1.2.2 Impacts in the City Center
The operation of proposed roads will decrease traffic volume of the existing roads in the city
center. About 20-30% of traffic on these roads will be attracted to the newly built roads. It is
predicted that the noise level along the road in the city center will be reduced by 1-5 dB with
the project than without.
7.1.3. Vibration
When the project is in operation, all the vibration levels along the roads can meet the
standard.
124



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject  Environmental Impact Assessment
7.1.4 Sunshine Obstruction
Because the proposed Jianshe-Nanwu Road is an elevated road, the sunshine time on the both
sides will decrease from 5.5 hours to 2.6 hours. There is no impact of sunshine obstruction on
the other road sections.
7.1.5 Terrestrial Environment
The road widening will demolish some trees and green spaces in the existing road. However,
newly built green separation barriers (99,396 mi2) will mitigate the impact in some extent.
Additional 1,856 trees will also be planted along the new roads. The green space will be
27,627 m2 more than existing. The total length of afforestation is 23.7 m.
The additional green areas will produce a better ecological environment and scene for the
city.
7.1.6 Hydrology and Water Quality
The proposed roads are predicted to have no significant impact on existing water quality.
7.2   Socio-economic Components
7.2.1 Impacts on Urban Traffic
With the rapid economic development in resent years, the serious traffic problem is becoming
one of the major reason to restrain the development in the urban area of the city. There is not
an east-west corridor in the city, because the east section of Beiyi Road and the west section
of Lianhe Road are missing links. Jianshe-Nanwu Road and Pangjiang Street are bottle necks
with heavy traffic.
To connect the missing links and co'nstruct Gonghe Interchange will provide an east-west
traffic corridor in the urban area. The corridor will attract more traffic from Shifu Road in the
city center. The First Ring Road will play a dominant role of traffic in the city center after the
construction of proposed viaduct(from Aigong Street to Fangxing Square) of Jianshe-Nanwu
Road and the widening of Pangjiang Street.
The missing connection of Tianguang Street, Shenzhou Road and Sanjing Street; and the
widening of Zhulin Road, Helongjiang Street and Nanjingnan Street will provide help on
comprehensive upgrading of the road network in the urban city. To construct or upgrade the
Bus Repair Facility and the Bus Terminal will reduce the time person trip and improve better
condition for the bus riders, which has a prominent social and economic benefit.
7.2.2 Impacts on Community Environment
The existing community along Beiyi Road is an old residential area with some shabby single-
story buildings and inadequate infrastructure. The new road will provide some opportunity to
improve the infrastructure and develop the economic in the community. The living quality
will also be improved by newly built rehabilitation buildings for the resettled residents.
125



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject  Environmental Impact Assessment
The new corridor will not only improve the traffic from east to west, but also promote the
economic development in the whole city.
7.2.3 Impacts on Economic Development
Based on the results in the survey of existing communities, the completion of the project will
promote the material and cultural exchange among the districts in the city; speed up the
development of industry, commnerce and service, finance, information and post; and provide
more employment.
The operation of the Beiyi-Lianhe Corridor will play an important role of the economic
development in the ciV' and benefit the social environment.
7.2.4 Impacts on Living Quality of People
The person trip time will be reduced after the construction of the roads, especially in east to
west. The convenient and smooth traffic will also benefit the commercial and service
industry.
7.3 Summary of Mitigation Measures
7.3.1  Design Phase
7.3.1.1 Noise
Construction Materials
*  The construction of viaduct will result in more extensive and louder traffic noise to the
vicinity of the viaduct. Surface road is always the solution and no viaduct will be
constructed except that the capacity is still insufficient through road widening.
*  Larger structures and the application of flexible joints, as well as minimizing the number
of joints (crevices) will be used for viaduct and interchange to reduce the noise generated
due to bumps by vehicles.
*  Application of flexible supports, such as rubber plates and bowl shaped biers, will be used
for viaduct and interchange to buffer vibration of the structure and resulting noise.
* In order to ensure traffic safety and minimize noise impacts caused by MV horn, green
space will be used to separate MV and NMV for roads with 40 m or wider width of red
line.
*  Instead of operation in the open air, bus repair facility and bus terminal will be housed in
fully closed building structures in order to reduce noise impact to the surrounding areas.
Sound Absorption Barrier Design
The location, shape, material, and height of SABs with roadside absorptive lining is
dependent on the function of roadside buildings, noise levels, road structure, resistance to
wind and erosion, safety and urban landscape.
As part of the integration of mitigation into project design, the Shenyang Municipal Design
126



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject   Environmental Impact Assessment
Institute has assisted with the preliminary design of noise mitigation structures. The primary
structures proposed for noise mitigation are SABs, taking aluminum alloy frame and PC
stamina plate of 3.5 mmn thick (light transparent rate 80%). However other methods such as
increasing the height of road dividers are also proposed. The locations of areas requiring
noise barriers and preliminary design drawings are shown in Figure 4.3.4-1. These drawings
have been incorporated for information only, as they may be modified during the detailed
design phase. The originals are available through the Municipal Design Institute.
Protection of Resident Buildings and Sensitive Receptors adjacent to the Road
In order to minimize potential noise impacts, representatives from the Shenyang Project
Office, Shenyang Ezqvironmental Science Institute and Shenyang Municipal Design Institute
carried out on-site visits to the buildings and sensitive receptors along the project roads and
discussed in detail the noise mitigation measures proposed. The parties reached agreement on
noise control measures.
Noise Mitigation Design for Bus Repair Facility
In the design phase, vibration reduction pad will be designed for large-sized stamping
equipment causing high vibration, and soft connection with rubber or canvas will be used at
the outlets of the air blowers in order to minimized noise and vibration.
7.3.1.2 Vibration
D Larger structures and the application of flexible joints, as well as minimizing the number
ofjoints will be used for viaduct and interchange to reduce vibration.
* Application of flexible supports, such as rubber plates and bowl shaped supports for
viaduct and interchange to buffer vibration of structure and resulting noise.
7.3.1.3 Air Quality
Emission Treatment Process Design for Paint-spraying and Baking-finish of the Bus
Repair Facility
In order to mitigate air pollution from paint-spraying and baking-finish, catalytic combustion
process will be designed for the treatment of the emission from paint-spraying and baking-
finish.
Dust Removal Process Design for Boiler Emission
In the process design of the Bus Repair Facility, rough stone water film dust precipitator will
be considered for the treatment of the boiler emission.
7.3.1.4 Water Quality
Treatment Process for Waste Water withI Oil Contaminant
Vehicle external washing wastewater and oil contaminated water of the Bus Repair Facility
will firstly go into the oil removal tank to get rid of suspended oil and sedimentation sludge,
127



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject  Environmental Impact Assessment
and go to aeration tank to remove soluble oil and fine suspended particles and then enter
water recycling tank through filter. The effluent will be pumped to the water consumption
workshops for vehicle and floor washing and surplus water will be discharged.
Battery Cell Washing Water Treatment Process Design
The battery cell washing water and the waste liquid from the Bus Repair Facility will be
recovered by electrolyzation and neutralized with alkali waste liquid in the neutralization tank
so to achieve the target pH value for discharge.
Velhicle Washzing Waste Water Treatment Design
Vehicle washing wastewater from the Bus Terminal mainly contains suspended particles.
Sedimentation tank is specially designed for Bus Terminal and yehicle-washing wastewater
will be discharged after treatment in the sedimentation tank.
7.3.1.5 Vegetation and Landscape
- Box beams are to be adopted in the viaduct design.
- In the design, trees will be planted on the roadsides, bushes and lawns grow in the
separation space, ivy and lawn cover areas around interchanges.
7.3.1.6 People Living Quality
For road section where there is no intersection, pedestrian crossing zebras at 1 1 locations will
be marked at every distance of 300 rn or in front of the school gates along the project roads.
Pedestrian traffic signals must be installed at crossings of six or more MV traffic lanes (such
as Pangjiang Street, Beiyi Road, Lianhe Road and Nanjing Street).
7.3.2 Construction Phase
7.3.2.1 Noise
Although it is inevitable that noise will be generated during construction, noise impacts on
surrounding areas can be mitigated to some extent. Contractors must abide by the provisions
for construction noise prevention and control in the environmental noise prevention and
control regulations in Shenyang. The following mitigation measures are recommended:
*  Take magnesite slab or plastic fabric (2-3 m height) to enclose the construction site of
interchange or viaduct to mitigate noise;
*  Article 30 of the National Environmental Pollution Prevention Law (took effect on March
1, 1997) stipulates all noisy constructions are prohibited during night-time except rush-
repair, emergency or special process needs, requiring the permit from Shenyang
Environmental Protection Bureau and announcement to the residents by the contractor.
*  Employ low noise machinery and carry out monthly inspection and maintenance;
*  Contractor will rationalize work schedule and siting, keep noisy operations away from the
sensitive receptors;
*  Construction structures, such as viaduct structures used for Nanwu Road viaduct, Gonghe
Interchange and Fangxing Square Interchange will be prefabricated off-site and then
128



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Sbenyang Subproject   Environmental Impact Assessment
transported to the construction site for installation;
* If monitoring result shows noise exceeds the standard, Shenyang Environmental
Monitoring Center will immediately report to the Shenyang Project Office and this office
will compel the contractor to cease the operation.
7.3.2.2 Vibration
*  To mitigate vibration of large construction machinery, contractors must abide by the
environmental noise and control regulations in Shenyang. It is prohibited to use steam,
diesel engines and impact piling in the entire project sites.
* Except for emergency engineering, operation of strong vibration machinery is limited to
6:00 a.m.- 10:OQ p.m. Any extension of operation time must be approved by Shenyang
Environmental Protection Bureau with appropriate mitigation measures in place.
*  Low vibration level machinery will be required and must be subject to regular
maintenance and repairs to be kept in good working order.
7.3.2.3 Air Quality
The Subproject construction will take a number of years and cover wide areas. Mitigation
measures to prevent or reduce dust are as follows:
*  Debris from building demolition must be moved away in a day and dusty construction
materials such as double ash gravel will be transported as required and there allow no
piling-up at the construction site;
*  Construction sites of viaduct or interchange must be enclosed with magnesite slab and
plastic fibre (2-3 m height);
*  Water spraying will be conducted three times per day to reduce dust;
*  Vehicles transporting loose materials must be covered with straw mats;
*  Concrete mixing will be done in the suburban concrete mixing station;
*  Proper operations, maintenance and repair of power generators and construction
machinery will be carried out to minimize emissions.
7.3.2.4 Vegetation and Landscape
The following measures will be implemented:
* Contractors must protect existing green space beyond the red line from construction to
operation. If the vegetation damages, it must be replanted to compensate.
* Trees and lawn of 236,700 m2 are going to be planted along the project roads, of which
36,000 m2 for Jianshe-Nanwu Corridor, 23,800 m2 for Beiyi Road, 73,500 m2 forLianhe
'-Road, 18,000 m2 for Pangjiang Street, 17,400 m2 for Zhulin Road, 11,000 m2 forNanjing
Street, 12,500 m2 for Sanjing Street, 6,500 m2 for Heilongjiang Street, 8,100 m2 for for
Shenzhou Road and 9,900 m2 for Tianguang Street;
*  Woods of 20,000 m2 will be planted in the west of the Bus Repair Facility.
7.3.2.5 Sunshine
Store-houses for construction materials will be located opposite to the sunshine and behind
129



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject   Environmental Impact Assessment
the residential buildings and at a certain distance of the sensitive receptors.
7.3.2.6 Water Quality
k  The domestic sewage of the workers during construction phase will be discharged into
municipal drainage system through public toilet on street or temporary toilet or will be
transported to farm land and used as fertilizer.
*  The runoff of the rain will be discharged into municipal drainage system.
*  The waste water collection facility will be installed in the construction site when North
Canal section of Lianhe Road is under construction. Therefore the rain can go into
municipal drainage system through outlets.
* Construction maclixiery will be maintained periodically to avoid fuel leakage.
7.3.2.7 People Living Quality
*  When carrying out construction in front of schools, the construction responsible unit will
appoint a specific person or persons to guide the pupils travel through the construction
site;
*  Pedestrian crossing zebra will be marked when the construction is in density residential
area or commercial area; path with prevention net will be installed when constructing a
viaduct or an interchange;
?  Separate roadside construction will be adopted for road widening in order to provide
traffic convenience.
7.3.3 Operation Phase
7.3.3.1 Noise
*  The vehicle noise emission will be monitored annually based on noise standard. Curtailed
inspection will be undertaken on road for MWs. The vehicle that can not meet the standard
must be maintained or changed by sile'ncer.
* Horn prohibition of MV will be carried out based on the Notice of Horn Prohibition of
MV within First Ring Road in Shenyang issued by Municipality in July 1995.
*  Heavy-duty vehicles (trucks) are prohibited to travel along the proposed viaducts since
April 5 1998, according to Notice on Readjustment of Truck Volume within the Second
Ring Road in Shenyang (July, 1995) issued by Shenyang Transportation Command
Center.
*  The noise barriers and pavement will be maintained periodically.
7.3.3.2 Vibration
The rougher the road surface becomes due to wear over time, the stronger the vibration. In
addition, vibration will increase if changes occur to fleet composition and speed pattern, e.g.,
a greater proportion of heavy-duty and medium-duty vehicles.
* To prevent and reduce traffic vibration during the operation phase to meet the requirement
for various zones prescribed by the Environmental Vibration Standard for Urban Areas
(GB 10070-88), attention will be paid to road structure and efficient road and traffic
130

management.
* Restrict timely freight vehicle traffic in the urban area since April 5,1998 according to the
Notice on Freight Vehicle Traffic Flow Arrangement within the Second Ring Road
issued by Shenyang Traffic Steering Committee on April 1, 1998;
7.3.3.3 Air Quality
In regard of the long-term air quality of the city, transport project benefit will be offset by
motor vehicle growth. In order to mitigate the long-term impact of a transport project on the
air quality, and finally achieve a sustainable improvement of the air quality in the project city,
a long-term Motor-Vehicle Emission Control Strategy will be developed and implemented in
addition to the follo,Fving decided mitigation measures.
Unleaded Fuel
According to the Document (1997) No.85 issued by the Administrative Department of
Shenyang Municipal Government, unleaded fuel will be used from Nov. 1 1998 onwards in
Shenyang city, and there will be no lead in the emission to pollute the environment.
Public Transport Promotion
Measure will be taken to add new bus routes, to adjust existing bus routes and to create bus-
only lanes to attract more people travel by buses, increase the modal share and in addition,
reduce emission from motorized vehicles.
Road Improvement
This project will is aiming to improve road smoothness and to install MV and NMV
separation and incremental signals on roads with 40 m or wider width of red line. The
objective is to improve traffic condition, reduce number of stops, increase travel speed, as a
result to mitigate pollution in the near future.
Buses Inspection and Maintenance Enforcement
Considering the fact that air pollution caused by bus noise and emission is greater than the
other vehicles, a new Bus Repair Facility is to be built in the suburb of Shenyang. This
facility will annually undertake major repair for 500 vehicles (400 buses and 100 mini buses)
and medium repair for 500 vehicles (400 buses and 100 mini buses).
Motor Vehicle Emission Control Strategy (MVECS) Development
Th'ough Shenyang has already included the (MVECS) strategy to apply unleaded fuel, clean
fuel and emission clarification facilities in the Ninth Five Year Plan and 2010 Plan for
Shenyang Environmental Protection, more comprehensive, Systematic, scientific and
practical control strategy is needed because of increasing serious pollution caused by urban
traffic and transport. Therefore, Shenyang city has decided to include a Technical Assistance
& Training component relate to Motor Vehicle Emission Control Strategy (MVECS). The
MVECS will consists of but not limited to the following mitigation measures:
131



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject   Environmental Impact Assessment
1) Collect information and assess current situation
2) Research of the future trends on the motor vehicle fleet, emission control technologies and
other factors which may affect the growth of motor vehicles such as population, urban
development and standards of living in the future; predict the variation in motor vehicle
emissions, air pollution load and air quality in the future in the city
3) Study various technologies in motor vehicle emission control and reduction (the focus will
be on their effectiveness and success in application)
4) On the basis of a clear understanding of the issue facing the project cities, the trends of
motor vehicle growth and impact of the emissions on air quality, and knowledge of motor
vehicle emission control technologies and programs, a series of motor vehicle control
measures will be dev'eloped as the core of the strategy. These measures will include but not
limited to:      - A
*       Promote unleaded fuel
*       Stringent on motor vehicle emission control standard and regulations
*       Enhanced Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Program
*       Introducing catalyst clarification facility
*       Motor improvement
*       Vehicle replacement
*       Inspecting and imposing Vehicle Emission Control Standard and Regulations
*       Making major efforts to develop public transport
*       Increasing MV speed
*       Limiting MV fleet in the urban area
*       Technical innovation of clean fuel or substitute fuel
5) A detailed plan will be developed to ensure the strategy will be adopted and implemented.
The details may include designate executive/responsible agencies, implementing schedule,
budget allocation, monitoring and reporting procedures, and feedback system.
6) Reporting: The MVECS development is included in the T.A. of the LUTP and completed
by December 200 1(the main responsible agency is the Project Office). The total input will be
40 man-months and the total cost about 150,000 US dollars for the three project cities.
Shenyang will contribute 50,000 US dollars.
MVECS Implementation
From December 2002, mitigation measures of the MVECS will be gradually implemented
and the specific action plan will be developed in the study.
New Paint-spraying Material
The Bus Repair Facility is going to take a new type of diluent of high effect and multiple
functions to reduce pollution caused by benzene series.
7.3.3.4 Sunshine
It is very difficult to improve the sunshine level by only increasing the setback. Changing the
use of affected buildings is recommended as the prime way of minimizing impact as
132



Liaoning Urban Transport Project - Shenyang Subproject  Environmental Impact Assessment
discussed below.
Change the use of adjacent buildings wherever feasible.
*  Locate rooms such as nurseries, kindergartens, sanitariums, and greenhouses, which
require long exposure to sunshine at the roadsides with Class 1 sunshine level, or if
possible, on the higher floors to avoid sunshine obstruction. Locate rooms such as
schools, offices, public buildings and general workshops along roadsides with Class 2
sunshine level. Locate general residential buildings and general service buildings along
roadsides with relatively low sunshine levels or on lower floors.
7.3.3.5 Water Qu Iity
An emergency plan will be developed for the operation phase to prevent water pollution of
the North Canal and gullies from accidental spills of fuels and hazardous chemicals.
Emergency Plan
An emergency plan will be developed to prevent water pollution of the North Canal and
gullies from accidental spills of fuels and hazardous chemicals. To avoid accidental leakage
during the transportation of dangerous goods, the department of transportation regulates
certification. The Public Security Bureau issues permits for the transportation of dangerous
goods. If an accident does occur, personmel from the Environmental Protection Bureau, the
Public Security Bureau, and transportation departments will handle it accordingly.
Permission Licence for Transportation of Hazardous Goods
-  Shenyang Hazardous Goods Transportation Regulation stipulates: transportation of
dangerous goods must be approved by the city transportation department, and a
permission licence must be obtained; the motor vehicle being used must be in good
condition with corresponding equipment for fire protection and a dangerous goods sign. It
also stipulates that no three-wheel motor vehicle, tractor, NMVs or motorcycle is allowed
to carry dangerous goods.
*  To transport explosive and chemical dangerous goods, carriers must obtain a permit for
explosive goods transportation or a permit for hazardous chemical transportation from the
Public Security Bureau.
Response to Accidents
* The National Environmental Protection Law stipulates that when there is an accident or
incident, the responsible organization must take action immediately; inforn the affected
or possible affected organizations and residents; report to the local Environmental
Protection Bureau and other related organization, and submit to any investigation
required.
* If any dangerous goods leakage or accident occurs on the project roads, according to the
National Water, Air Pollution Prevention and Shenyang Pollution Prevention
Management Regulation, the accident will be handled by Shenyang Environmental
Protection Bureau, Shenyang Public Security Bureau, and relevant transportation
departments.

7.4 Resettlement and Rehabilitation
3,107 households (6,2743.4 in2), with 9,329 residents, will be resettled in the project. 75
establishments, 16 institutions and 65 enterprises (61,023 mi2), 7,198 employees, will be
affected.
The rehabilitation is shown in Table 4.8-2.
7.5 Public Participation
124 units and 3,000 persons were involved in the public participation, in which more than
90% of them are positi4e to the project. The EA report were receipt by most of the public.
7.6 General Conclusions
In summary, Liaoning Urban Transport Project (LUTP)-Shenyang Subproject will assist in
providing a solution to traffic congestion in the city center, improve the quality of urban life
and stimulate economic development. It also create a nice condition to develop new space for
the city, calming the existing traffic and improve ecological environment.
The project will result in some degradation of air quality within the immediate vicinity of the
alignment (about 150 m) but will make a positive contribution to air quality improvement in
the overall urban area, especially in the city center. The noise level will also be increased in
some sections of the roads.
From the view of pollutant load control in the city, the project has obvious environmnental and
social benefit. Therefore, the project is feasible environmentally, if the preferred option for
particular road sections are selected, and if the recommended mitigation measures are
implemented effectively, which these measures will help prevent and minimize potentially
adverse impacts. The project also allows for the opportunity to enhance the environment in
the city center though longer term solutions such as traffic management, urban planning and
implementing the various components of the motor vehicle pollution control proposals in the
near future.
