REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FOR A NEPAL INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Kingdom of Nepal for the equivalent of US$4.0 million on stand-
ard IDA terms to help meet the foreign exchange requirements of the Nepal
Industrial Development Corporation-(NIDC) over the next two years for lending
to private sector industries and tourism. The procee,ds,of the credit would be
relent to NIDC at 8.2% per annum with repayment over a period of 18 years in-
cluding 3 years grace on the basis of a flexible amortization schedule reflect-
ing the repayment terms of the sub-loans made by NIDC.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        The .most recent economic report entitled "'Review of the Economic.
Situation of Nepal" (Report No. 1180-NEP) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on July 30, 1976. The principal findings of the report and the
developments since then are described below. Country data are shown in
Annex I.
3.        Nepal has been classified by the United Nations as one,of the
least-developed countries in the world. Its per capita inucome in 1975 was
estimated at $110.   It has a population of 12.6 million, estimated to be
growing at around 2% per year. A large proportion, nearly 96% of the popula-
tion, live in rural areas. Health and education facilities are below the
standards achieved in the rest of South Asia. Nepal has an infant mortality
rate of 200 per thousand live births, an adult literacy rate of 14%, and a
life expectancy at birth of less than 45 years.
4.        The country has a difficult topography which severely limits the
area of arable land. Yet population density is now 450 per,square kilometer
of land for all of Nepal and 930 persons in the Hill areas where 59% of the
people live, Already the results of pushing the area of cultivated land
beyond economically feasible and ecologically safe limits are being felt
in the Hill areas. Agricultural yields have declined, and soil erosion and
landslides have resulted in these areas.   In the. Terai plains where food-
grains, sugar and jute are grown, little room is left for,extending the cul-
tivated areas.  The traditional gra-..n surpluses produced,in the Terai are
declining as population has grown.
1/   Part I of this Report is reproduced verbatim from Report and Recommen-
dation of the President to the Executive Directors on a Proposed Credit
to the Kingdom of Nepal for a Second Water Supply and Sewerage Project
(Report No. P-2041-NEP of April 11, 1977).

5.        The landlocked position of the country imposes an additional con-
straint. Far removed from sources of supplies of development goods and ac-
cess to export markets, development is more costly in Nepal than in many
other countries. Moreover, uncertainties of trade and transit over the sub-
continent complicates all economic decision-making, necessitates the holding
of relatively large foreign exchange reserves, and reduces the country's
attraction to private investors.
6.        The economy is predominantly agricultural.   About 67% of total
value added originates in agriculture, and over 90% of the labor force is
engaged in this activity. Agricultural products constitute more than 80% of
Nepal's exports. Ninety percent of these exports go to India. Rice, the main
export, accounts for about 60% of the total export value, while jute is the
second most important. Industrial value added amounts to onLy 4% of GDP and
Nepal, therefore, has to import almost all of its capital goods and a large
part of manufactured consumer goods.
7.        In the past decade, Nepal's GDP growth rate averaged 2.4% per year,
marginally above the rate of population growth. Thus far, development efforts
have been mostly directed towards building an economic and administrative
infrastructure. This was necessary since it was only in the early fifties
that the Government adopted economic and social development as major objec-
tives. The investments in infrastructure made since then were the country's
first steps toward modernization. They have not yet paid off, however, in
terms of accelerated economic growth.
88.       There have been no significant changes in the trend of economic
growth in 1975/76.'. The weather continues to be the main factor which deter-
mines yearly fluctuations in growth. Last year, weather conditions were
very favorable, the grain crop was large, and GDP grew by about 4%, well above
the average of 2.4% of the past decade. The balance of payments benefitted
from temporarily larger rice exports, improved administrative control of rice
exports, increased incomes from tourism and increased inflows of remittances.
At the same time, imports of petroleum products, fertilizer, cement, and iron
and steel declined, because these items had been overstocked in the previous
year. Foreign exchange reserves rose by 6% to $119.7 million, the equivalent
of about nine months of imports. Last year's higher GDP growth rate and the
improvement in the balance of payments were chiefly due to fortuitous factors
rather than to an improvement in the longer term growth trend of the economy.
9.        After substantial efforts in the last two decades to build up the
country's infrastructure, Nepal's planners believe that the time has come for
a shift in the development strategy. The leading principle of the current
five-year plan (1976-80) is that Nepal should aim its development efforts at
deriving increased production benefits from its past efforts to establish and
expand the infrastructure. The allocation of investment funds under the plan
shows a drop in the share of transport and communications (from 41% to 23% of
the total) and corresponding increases in the share of agriculture, industry
and the social sectors. Attention is to be concentrated on quick-yielding
projects, mostly in agriculture but with an appropriate component of viable
import substitution in industry.



- 3 -
10.       The most important opportun ty to reap production gains lies in
agriculture. Present yields in the Terai, where most of the foodgrains
are cultivated, average only 1-1.3 tons per hectare. These yields can be
increased substantially by improvements in agricultural extension, by in-
creased application of inputs, and by minor irrigation.   Similar improve-
ments could also be extended to sugar and jute cultivation which also have
very low yields.   The wide difference between growing conditions in the
Hills and in the Terai offers scope for increased specialization and ex-
change of products.   For the time being, the Hills must continue to empha-
size food production in view of the serious food deficits in the area.
However, in the long run, the Hills area is comparatively well suited to
produce cash crops -- fruits, spices, vegetables, potatoes and natural silk,
etc. On a limited scale these items are already being produced. Achieve-
ment of production gains will also require the strengthening of marketing
and credit institutions. Some progress in institution-building has already
been made in recent years, as evidenced by the establishment of the Agricul-
tural Development Bank and the Agricultural Projects Services Center.
11.       Although agriculture must occupy a predominant position in Nepal's
development strategy, opportunities also exist in other directly productive
sectors, mainly industry and tourism, and these should be vigorously pursued.
The.contribution of modern industry to GDP is still small, about 4%, but it
has been growing.   Most of the sector consists of the processing of agricul-
tural products such as rice, wheat, vegetable oil, sugar and jute. The re-
mainder is made up of factories producing simple consumer goods, wood products,
bricks, tiles and cement. The'small size of the market, lack of raw materials,
competition from Indian products, and the shortage of domestic entrepreneurs
and trained workers will continue to be limiting factors for some time. Modern
industry, nevertheless, has its role in Nepal's future development.    The scope
for processing of agricultural products for domestic use and export should
increase with the intended diversification of agriculture. Further growth of
the economy will also present scope for more import substitution.
12.       Tourism has grown at 11.5% per year over the last five years;
tourist arrivals at present are estimated to be above 85,000. Foreign ex-
change earnings from this source are equivalent to those from merchandise
exports. In line with a master plan for the sector, prepared with German
assistance, a number of projects are to be undertaken to develop hill stations,
observation points, and national parks as well as to restore ancient temples,
and to strengthen the hotel school. While small in size, these projects-are
important for the long-term development of tourism,
13.       On the basis of these and other considerations, it appears that
there is sufficient scope for development of the directly-productive secto-rs
to allow a modest acceleration of GDI g-owth to perhaps 3.5% a year during
the last years of the decade and 4-C% in the 1980s.   The proposed develop-
ment strategy appears to be appropriate to Nepal's circumstances. The past
ratio of investment (8.5-10.5% of GDP) to growth (2% of GDP) appears to be
very high and, in view of the scarcity of resources in Nepal, the planners
are right in looking for opportunities for more rapid growth without neglect-
ing the need for completion of the basic infrastructure.



- 4 -
14.       Nepal has made commendable efforts to mobilize domestic resources
for development. In the last five years, real revenue growth has averaged over
7% per year, much higher than the growth rate of GDP, and budgetary savings
were maintained at 40% of revenue, slightly over 2% of GDP. This result was
obtained in the face of serious difficulties. On the revenue side, Nepal
s,uffers from the constraints of extreme poverty and low degree of monetiza-
tion of the economy. The open border with India, moreover, makes it difficult
to control foreign trade and to levy the trade taxes which play such a large
role in the tax system of most developing countries. On the current expendi-
tures side, the Government has to cope with rising claims for maintenance of
infrastructure and the need to raise government salaries from levels which
are low even by the standards of a poor country.
15.       In view of the pressures to increase current expenditures, all that
can be realistically expected in the next few years is that the Government
maintains its savings rate-at 2% of GDP. Only when economic growth starts
to accelerate significantly in the 1980s will there be prospects for an in-
crease in this rate. Given the constraints on mobilizing domestic resources,
which will prevail even with continued satisfactory fiscal management,
foreign aid will remain a decisive factor in Nepal's economic.develop-
ment. In fact, since public savings are likely to increase less rapidly than
public investment during the period of the current five-year plan, aid will
become, at least temporarily, more important. In view of this scarcity of
public savings, aid will have to cover not only the foreign exchange cost of
projects, but, as a rule, also at least part of local cost. Total aid dis-
bursements during 1971-75 (the previous five-year plan) averaged $33 million
a year in constant (1974/75) prices and covered 45% of public investment.
During 1976-80 (the present five-year plan), this proportion would have to
rise to 57% if public investment is not to be held back by lack of financial
resources. Under these circumstances, disbursements in real terms would have
to rise by around 12.5% per year to average -about $60 million in constant
(1974/75) prices and about $90 million in current prices.
16.       The international community has thus far been very responsive to
these aid needs of Nepal. Shortage of finance has not yet been a bottleneck,
and prospects are that aid flows of the required magnitude will continue
to be available. The real factor determining Nepal's development pace will
remain the growth of absorptive capacity, and it is this factor which will
determine the actual level of aid disbursements. The essential questions
regarding aid to Nepal are, therefore, what donors should do to attune their
aid programs to Nepal's development priorities and what they can do to raise
absorptive capacity.
17.       These questions, obviously requiring consultations between the Nepal
Government and the donors, provide the focus for the Nepal aid group which had
its first meeting in Tokyo last December. On the basis of sector and project
documentation prepared by the Government, the meeting reviewed the type of
projects needed to support the Government's development strategy and the type
of technical assistance programs needed to build up absorptive capacity. Sus-
tained attention to these matters in the framework of the aid group is expected



-5-
to lead to improvements in the composition of aid and to speed up the still
very slow rate of disbursement of aid funds.
18.       As of December 31, 1975, official foreign debt amounted to only $120
million, of which 28% was to IDA. Of the $120 million, $86 million re-
mained undisbursed. This low utilization is largely due to the fact that 80%
of foreign loans has been contracted since 1970. Debt service was about $1.5
million in 1975 or equivalent to about 2% of exports of goods and services.
However, future assistance may increasingly take the form of loans. Most of
them will probably be on concessionary terms, which is highly desirable in
view of Nepal's poverty and limited export prospects. In view of the accel-
erated development efforts, external public debt is expected to rise and,
based on the trend in recent years, may reach about $350 million by 1980, of
which approximately 50% could be in IDA credits. The total debt service ratio
by 1980 is, however, projected to remain below 10%. Debt service to the Bank
Group alone would be less than 2% of exports of goods and services.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NEPAL
19.       The first IDA credit to Nepal in the amount of $1.7 million equiva-
lent was made in FY70 for a telecommunications project. This was followed
by credits for highways ($2.5 million), tourism ($3.2 million), irrigation
($6.0 million), a second telecommunications project ($5.5 million), a water
supply and sewerage project ($7.8 million), a settlement project ($6.0 mil-
lion), a power project ($26.0 million), a rural development project ($8.0 mil-
lion), a groundwater project ($9.0 million), a technical assistance project
($3.0 million), additional financing ($4.0 million) to assist in meeting
an anticipated cost overrun in the first water supply and sewerage project 1/,
and a second water supply and sewerage project ($8.0 million) 2/. The pro-
posed credit would bring the total amount of IDA assistance to Nepal to $94.7
million equivalent, net of cancellations. No Bank loans have been made to
Nepal. IFC made its first investment in Nepal ($3.2 million) in a hotel pro-
ject in Kathmandu in FY75. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Group
operations as of March 31, 1977, and notes on the execution of ongoing IDA
projects. It shows that delays in the implementation of these projects are
common, particularly during the initial periods. These delays are largely due
to Nepal's limited technical and managerial capabilities. In order to assist
Nepal in coping with this constraint, considerable technical assistance is
being given by Bank Group staff, including our Resident Mission in Kathmandu.
As a result, improvement in the rate of disbursements is being realized.
During the first nine months of FY77, $4.2 million were disbursed compared to
$6..9 million disbursed during the entire previous six years. There is, however,
scope for substantial further improvemelnt.
1/    The proposal has been circulated to the Executive Directors on a no-
objection basis.
2/    Scheduled for presentation to the Board on April 26, 1977.



-6-
20.       Bank Group lending to Nepal has so far been at a modest level com-
pared to the country's need for, and total receipts of, external assistance.
The international community has persistently shown considerable interest in
Nepal's economic development and, to date, shortage of funds has not been a
bottleneck. The main constraint on utilization of increased aid has been
Nepal's limited absorptive capacity, affecting the pace of project prepara-
tion and implementation. The Bank has agreed to assist the Government in
project preparation through the technical assistance credit and by acting as
Executing Agency for a number of technical assistance projects in the current
UNDP Five-Year Program. The Bank Group has addressed the problem of ab-
sorptive capacity also through its role in organizing an aid group for Nepal
(para 17).
21.       The Bank Group's current strategy places major emphasis upon directly
productive sectors (particularly agriculture) and the development of comple-
mentary infrastructure, including feeder roads (particularly connecting the
Hills to the Terai), communications and hydroelectric power. A feeder roads
project has been appraised and is expected to be negotiated by the end of the
current fiscal year. Preparation of projects in irrigation, telecommunications,
rural development and horticulture is underway.
PART III - INDUSTRY AND TOURISM IN NEPAL
22.       Although the modern industrial sector in Nepal has been growing
rapidly, it still accounts for only 4% of GDP. There are approximately 2,400
manufacturing establishments in Nepal, employing about 50,000 workers. Most
of these are small, with 80% employing less than 10 workers and only about 3%
employing 100 or more workers.
23.       Most modern industry in Nepal, aside from tourism, is an extension
of the agricultural sector. Of these, rice and oil mills account for 76% of
the total number of establishments, 50% of the value added, and employ 10,000
workers. Next in importance are jute mills, employing about 5,000 workers.
Other industrial activities include sugar processing, cigarette and shoe fac-
tories, sawmilling, brick and tile manufacturing, mechanical workshops, a
brewery, and a recently established cement plant. Capacity utilization for
the major industrial subsectors appears to be running at a reasonably high
level and does not seem to be severely hampered by shortages of agricultural
raw materials. Productivity is low, however, due to overstaffing of most
establishments and frequent temporary closures caused by shortages of im-
ported raw materials and spare parts.
24.       Most industries were established or expanded after 1955, when the
Government's policy became more specific with the adoption of five-year plans,
a general statement of industrial policy (in 1957), and the creation of NIDC
in 1959 to finance private industry. The Government's attitude towards the
private sector has remained positive, illustrated by the generous incentives
it has granted. Despite this encouragement, in the initial years of indus-
trialization, entrepreneurs were slow in making investments in industry



- 7 -
primarily because entrepreneurial and managerial talent was in short supply
and the domestic market small-and geographically dispersed. Furthermore,
other lucrative investment opportunities have been available in such areas as
trade and real estate. Due to lack of private interest, the Government under-
took a number of industrial projects which had been initially reserved for the
private sector, but it has been less active in recent years. At the same
time, the Government has recently increased the number of industries open to
private investment. The Government's current primary objectives for develop-
ment of the industrial sector are the encouragement of both import substitution
and export industries based mainly on local agricultural raw materials and
forest products.- Generation of employment opportunities is also given high
priority.
25.       Cottage and village industries (defined as enterprises having
capital investment of less than Rs 200,000) accounted for approximately 7%
of GDP in 1975, which is almost double the contribution of the modern indus-
trial sector. The sector is also the second main source of employment, after
agriculture, providing over a million workers with full or part-time jobs.
The goods produced by cottage and village industries include handloom cloth,
curio goods, rugs, footwear, simple tools, and household utensils.
26.       Long-term funds for public sector industrial development are provided
by the Government and foreign aid, while-funds for private investment come
from NIDC and entrepreneurs' own resources. To date, commercial banks have
not-made long-term industrial loans to any significant extent. NIDC is,
therefore, the leading financial institution providing long-term financing in
local currency and foreign exchange for private industries with capital
investment greater than Rs 0.2 million. While the two commercial banks in
Nepal have been the main source of working capital financing for industry, it
was not until 1975, when the Commercial Bank Act was amended, that they could
extend term loans. Although the commercial banks have access to some foreign
exchange from the Government, it appears doubtful that they will compete to any
extent with NIDC given their weakness in project appraisal. In the event they
do make industrial term loans, it may be done jointly with NIDC, which could
do project appraisal and supervision for a fee. The commercial banks are,
however, expected to become more actively involved in small-scale and cottage
industry lending (those units with investment below Rs 1.0 million). They have
been instructed by the Nepal Rastra Bank (the Central Bank) to lend 7% of
their total deposits to these sectors, including small-scale agriculture.
From 1972, NIDC was involved in cottage and village industry financing through
its fully owned small-scale industries development corporation (SIDC). In
July, 1976, however, the Government required NIDC to transfer SIDC's lending
responsibilities to the Cottage Industries Department (CID). The commercial
banks, with their wide branch system, are better placed than NIDC to provide
financing to village and small-scale iAdustry while the CID will provide
extension services.
27.       The tourism sector in Nepal has expanded rapidly in recent years,
growing by an average of about 11.5% per year over the last five years. Gross
foreign exchange earnings by tourism are estimated at $13.6 million in FY76,
roughly equal to earnings from all merchandise exports and representing an



- 8 -
increase of 41% over FY75. The sector also provides employment to a growing
number of people (currently 7,500). In 1976, approximately 85,000 tourists
visited Nepal and the number is expected to reach more than 130,000 by 1980.
Guided by a tourism master plan which was prepared in 1972 with German techni-
cal assistance, the Government set out to remove the hotel accommodation
constraint in the Kathmandu area. When all extensions and new hotels under
construction are completed, it is expected that this capacity constraint will
be eliminated. The Government's present objectives for development of tourism
focus on expansion of areas of interest outside the Kathmandu Valley, through
construction of a few selected hotels and trekking lodges, and on the provision
of appropriate training of guides, hotel staff, and employees of tourist
information centers to benefit the sector as a whole. Financing for tourism
projects has come primarily from NIDC and private entrepreneurs, and to some
extent from foreign aid.
28.       In 1972, NIDC was selected as a channel for a $3.2 million IDA
credit to the Government for tourism (see Annex II). NIDC faced some difficul-
ties during the initial phase of implementation of this project, largely due
to its unfamiliarity with IDA procedures. Its performance has subsequently
improved and is now satisfactory. Bank Group involvement in the industrial
sector in Nepal began in a significant way in 1973 when, at the request of the
Government, a mission reviewed NIDC's operations and found NIDC's foreign
currency resource position to be comfortable and IDA funding unnecessary for
several years. At present, there is scope for a credit of $4.0 million in
foreign exchange to NIDC for private industrial investment and a need for
technical assistance over the next two years. IDA will also be contributing
to development of the sector through feasibility studies of industrial projects
to be financed out of the Technical Assistance credit (Cr. 659). The projects
thus prepared could be financed by the Government, NIDC, IDA, or other foreign
donors.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
29.       The proposed project was appraised in September, 1976, and incor-
porates the findings of a reconnaissance mission in late October, 1973, and a
preparation mission in December, 1975. A report entitled "Nepal - Appraisal
of the Nepal Industrial Development Corporation" (No. 1398a-NEP of April 15,
1977) is being distributed separately to the Executive Directors. Negotiations
were held in Washington on March 15 to 22, 1977. The Borrower's delegation
was led by Mr. T.B. Prasai, General Manager of NIDC. A credit and project
summary is attached as Annex III.
History and Past Operations
30.       NIDC was established in 1959 as a fully government owned institution
with the responsibility for promoting and financing private industry, in-
cluding tourism. Its authorized capital has been gradually increased from



- 9 -
Rs 10 million in 1959 to Rs 250 million in 1976. The paid-in capital is cur-
rently Rs 139.3 million, Rs 130.3 million of which has been provided by the
Government and Rs 9.0 million by the Rastra Bank. NIDC's operations have
fluctuated widely from year to year. Net approvals amounted to Rs 41 million
in FY74, Rs 145 million in FY75, and Rs 16 million in FY76. From its inception
to the end of FY75, there has been a large gap between approvals and disburse-
ments due to the high level of cancellations resulting from changes in investors'
interest and slow rate of implementation of the projects. In FY76, approvals
dropped to a very low level, primarily because interest rates increased sharply
from an average of 7.5% to 14%. Disbursements grew from Rs 16 million in FY73
to Rs 29 million in FY74 and Rs 58 million in FY75, and were Rs 43 million in
FY76. Loans and investments outstanding have increased strongly in recent
years from Rs 98 million in July, 1974 to Rs 173 million in July, 1976, in-
dicating that private investor interest is gaining momentum. As of July, 1976,
tourism projects accounted for 37% of loans outstanding, food manufacturing
28%, and cement 14%. The rest of the portfolio is reasonably well diversified
among various other industries.. Financing of manufacturing projects has in-
creased significantly in recent years, from 42% of loans outstanding in FY72
to 58% in FY76, while transportation and power financing has declined. Manu-
facturing is expected to become more important in the future, whereas NIDC's
exposure in tourism will decline (to about 25% of the portfolio by FY80) when
the hotels under construction are completed.
31.    -  NIDC's loans are generally small; the average size over the past
two years was about Rs 2.0 million compared to Rs 0.4 million in the pre-
vious five years. Since July, 1976, NIDC no longer lends to cottage and vil-
lage industry by Government directive (para 26). More than 75% of NIDC's
loans by amount and number have been for new projects over the past six years.
The bulk of its loan approvals since FY71 have been directed towards metro-
politan areas, following the national pattern of industrial distribution.
The geographic distribution of NIDC's portfolio should widen in the future
with the recent, opening of three branches (in the Central, Eastern, and
Western Regions).
Institutional Aspects
32.       In order to strengthen the organizational structure of NIDC, its
management, with IDA assistance, made the following changes which became
effective on February 13, 1977: (a) NIDC's organization was divided into two
major parts, administration and operations departments, each headed by a
Deputy General Manager; (b) the responsibilities for financial and accounting
activities were merged from two' divisions into one; (c) project implementation,
supervision, and follow-up activities were merged into one division; (d) the
research and planning branch was put under direct supervision of the General
Manager; and (e) the regional offices w(re upgraded and will be more fully
used for follow-up and, to a limitec ex.ent, appraisal work.
33,       NIDC's Board of Directors consists of six members, all appointed by
the Government; four are from the public sector and two are from the private
sector (industry or trade). NIDC's General Manager, who was appointed in
July, 1976, is from the public sector. Although he is a capable administrator,



- 10 -
he lacks development banking experience. Consideting this, it was agreed to
attach an experienced development banker to NIDC as an advisor for about two
years (Section 2.10 of the Project Agreement). This advisor will be financed
by UNDP with IDA as executing agency. In view of weaknesses in the accounting
and management information systems as well as limited resource and planning
expertise, it was also agreed that an accounting and information systems
advisor will be attached to NIDC for about two years (Section 2.10 of the
Project Agreement).    The United Kingdom has agreed, in principle, to finance
this advisor subject to review of the formal request from the Government.
The advisors are expected to cost about $54,000 per man year each and their
appointment is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit (Section
5.01 (c) of the Development Credit Agreement). As of July, 1976, NIDC had a
staff of 75 reasonably well qualified professionals. However, NIDC lacks
qualified accountants and has confirmed its intention to hire one by September
30, 1977 (Section 2.11 of the Project Agreement). NIDC must follow rules set
by the Public Service Commission for hiring, firing, promotion, and pay-scales.
New rules have recently been issued, allowing NIDC increased flexibility in
personnel policies. In July, 1976, NIDC's Industrial Planning and Feasibility
Division was transferred by the Government to the Industrial Services Center
(ISC). ISC was given the task of undertaking feasibility studies and promotion
activities for the public as well as private industrial sectors. Because of
its large responsibilities, ISC has been able to devote little attention to the
private sector. NIDC, therefore, has been assigning a few of its staff to work
on industrial promotion and feasibility studies and will contihue to do so in
the future.
34.       NIDC's appraisal standards are in need of improvement.    Cost esti-
mates, coverage of marketing aspects, and appraisal of management tend to be
weak and have contributed to cost overruns on many projects. Internal finan-
cial and economic rates of return are seldom calculated. NIDC, has, therefore,
agreed that (i) the internal financial rate of return will be calculated for
all projects costing more than Rs 1 million, and (ii) the economic rate of
return will be calculated for all projects costing more than R-s 2.5 million
(Section 2.12 of the Project Agreement). Special attention will be paid to
capacity utilization within an existing industry before financing new under-
takings.
Policies and Procedures
35.       Prior to September, 1976, NIDC had no formal policy statement and
made policy decisions on an ad hoc basis as circumstances required. In
September, 1976, NIDC drafted a formal policy statement, with assistance from
IDA, which was approved by NIDC's Board on April 7, 1977. NIDC's financing
will be limited to private enterprises only and assistance can take the forms
of medium and long-term loans, equity participation, guarantees, and technical
and managerial advice. The maturity of NIDC's loans will vary, depending upon
the client's debt-service capacity, but will not exceed 15 years. NIDC will
acquire or retain more than 50% ownership in any manufacturing enterprise only
in exceptional circumstances, and the total commitment to any single enterprise
will not normally exceed 25% of NIDC's share capital and reserves.

36.       NIDC's procurement practices are generally satisfactory.   NIDC's
technical staff are competent in advising on simple projects, but should make
use of outside consultants on technically more complex projects. Bids are
usually invited from-at least three sources and,selection of a supplier is
based on price, delivery time, availability of service and spare parts, as
well as quality and reputation.. NIDC's disbursement practices are also gener-
ally satisfactory.
37.       NIDC's.follow.up activities are-inadequate.   Due to lack of staff,
few follow-up visits.,are made and, in many cases, NIDC.does not receive the
quarterly reports from its clients required in the loan agreements. In addi-
tion to the organizational changes and increased use of regional offices that
were adopted (para 32), NIDC intends to assign additional staff to follow-up
activities and-to coordinate its reporting requirements with those of the
Ministry of Industry and Commerce.
Lending Rates and Resource Mobilization
38.       NIDC's lending ratestfor both local and foreign currency were re-
duced from 14% to 11%, on the average, in July, 1976, in accordance with
the Rastra Bank's.general-interest rate adjustment. These rates-vary between
geographic districts- no less than 10%, 11%, and 12% in the least developed
areas, most developed areas, and elsewhere, respectively - and are in line
with those of commercial banks.. NIDC has agreed,to charge no less than 11%
on loans provided from the IDA credit, exc.ept.for loans made to projects
located in the least developed areas which will be made at no less than 10%
(Section 3.09 of the Project Agreement).  This would give NIDC an overall
spread of about 3.0%.on IDA funds, as the volume of lending at 10% for least
developed areas is. expected to be more than offset by lending at 12% or more to
the most developed areas.. NIDC's spread on local.currency borrowings is also
projected to be about 3.0% and.no equity contributions are,expected to be made
until after FY81 (para 40). This will produce a total spread of about 3.0% on
lending operations for the-next few years.   Although this represents a reduction
from prior years, 1/ it is sufficient.in view of NIDC's low administrative
costs which were 1.6%-of.average,total assets in.FY76 and are expected to
decline to 1.0%. in-FY81., NIDC's lending rate is positive in real terms.  Since
NIDC's loans-are all denominated in Nepalese rupees, the.foreign exchange risk
on loans from.foreign sources.is not passed on to the sub-borrowers but is
assumed by NIDC which,. in turn, is reimbursed for any losses by the Rastra
Bank. In.view of.the, early stage of-industrialization and the aversion of
Nepal's generally small entrepreneurs to risk taking, the Government has agreed
that under the proposed credit the Rastra Bank will continue to .compensate NIDC
for all foreign exchange losses (Section 3.04 of the Development Credit Agree-
ment). This will be done.on an annual basis,- as soon as possible after the
close of NIDC's financial year.
1/   In the past, NIDC's large base of free equity (para 40) contributed
greatly to low financing costs. As further contributions are made
in the form of loans, however, the impact of this base will diminish
and overall financial costs are expected to rise from 1.0% of ave 7age
total assets in FY76 to 5.3% in FY81.



- 12 -
39.       During the past two years, the Rastra Bank has adjusted interest
rates twice; in April, 1975, and July, 1976. As part of the April, 1975., rate
changes, all financial institutions, including NIDC, were directed to provide
a clause in their loan agreements to the effect that loans made subsequent
to that date would carry rates of interest which are to be adjusted retro-
actively in the event of changes by the Rastra Bank in the interest rate
structure. the Government has since reconsidered the wisdom of applying the
policy to institutions doing long-term lending and has concluded that it might
have a negative impact on the demand for long-term loans. The Government has,
therefore, exempted NIDC and the commercial banks from the retroactive interest
rate adjustment policy effective February 13, 1977.
40.       For local currency resources, NIDC has relied, so far, on the Gov-
ernment. The Government subscriptions to NIDC's share capital constitute over
90% of its local resources, the remainder coming from a Rastra Bank loan, loan
collections, and reserves and retained earnings. As a result, NIDC has an
extremely unleveraged capital structure with a debt to equity ratio of 0.5:1.
This practice of funding NIDC with large amounts of free equity, which rarely
carried dividends, has constituted an unjustified subsidy to NIDC and its
sub-borrowers. For the foreseeable future, the Government intends to make
local currency resources available in the form of loans either from the
Government or the Rastra Bank. NIDC also expects to generate local currency
through issuing debentures. However, after FY81, further equity might be
required. Indian currency resources have been available to NIDC through
conversion of Nepalese currency into Indian rupees and this is expected to
continue. In the past, NIDC has obtained, in addition, four lines of credit
in Indian rupees, most of which have been utilized. As of July 15, 1976,
total inconvertible resources available to NIDC for disbursement were Rs 17.8
million. Commitments at that time amounted to Rs 62.1 million, the balance to
be covered through borrowing from the Rastra Bank under a line of credit
amounting to Rs 90.0 million.
41.       NIDC's non-Indian foreign currency resources have come from eight
loans and credits from five different sources. In a few cases, part of the
loans and credits were cancelled when NIDC proved unable to use all the funds
provided, either because there was insufficient demand for goods from the
particular source to which procurement was tied or because available funds
exceeded demand from investors. As of mid-July, 1976, NIDC had Rs 25.'3 mil-
lion equivalent available to cover estimated requirements of Rs 34.4 million
equivalent, creating a shortfall of Rs 9.1 million. This will be covered
in FY77 by an allocation of Rs 10.0 million in foreign exchange from the
Government to NIDC.
Profitability and Financial Position
42.       NIDC's net profits after tax increased from Rs 144,000 in FY71
to Rs 1,469,000 in FY76 and assets grew from Rs 86.6 million to Rs 226.4
million over the same period. NIDC's profitability was low in the past but
has increased in recent years from net profit/average equity of 0.2% in FY72
to 1.1% in FY76.   It is expected to rise to 2.8% by FY81.   A debt-equity



- 13 -
limit of 5:1 has been set (Section 3.05 of the Project Agreement), although
NIDC is not expected to reach this limit within the next five years. Prin-
cipal and interest in arrears over six months as a percentage of loans out-
standing have decreased dramatically from 30.3 in FY73 to only 11.5 in FY76,
indicating strong improvement in NIDC's collection performance.
Projected Operations and Resource Requirements
43.       NIDC expects to commit Rs 208 million over the next two years to
July, 1979:- Rs 51 million ($4.0 million) in non-Indian foreign currency
loans, Rs 78 million equivalent in Indian currency loans, and Rs 79 million
in local currency loans and investments (Annex III). NIDC's Strategy State-
ment, which was approved by its Board on April 7, 1977, outlines its plans
for strengthening its operational capability so as to be able to cope with
this increase in the lending program, and outlines future lending strategy
which is guided by the Government's industrial policies. Although NIDC will
continue to seek other sources of funds, at the present time it has no sources
of non-Indian foreign currency other than an annual allotment from the Govern-
ment (para 41). The proposed credit of $4.0 million equivalent would cover 40%
of NIDC's total foreign exchange requirements of $10 million (including Indian
rupees) for the'period July 1977 - July 1979. Though the IDA credit can be
used for the import of Indian machinery and equipment, it is expected that
these imports will be met by local currency sources (para 40), which are
convertible into Indian rupees.
The Proposed Credit
44.       The proposed credit would be used to meet 100% of the foreign ex-
change expenditures for directly imported capital goods and services for sub-
projects sponsored by private productive enterprises to be broadly defined
to include not only manufacturing, but also agro-industries, construction,
and tourism projects.
45.       The credit would be made to the Government to be relent to NIDC
through a subsidiary loan agreement on terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Association (Section 3.02 of the Development Credit Agreement). NIDC would
pay the Government interest at 8.2% per annum with repayment over a period
of 18 years including 3 years grace on the basis of a flexible amortization
schedule reflecting the repayment terms of the sub-loans made by NIDC. NIDC
would also pay to the Government a commitment fee of 0.75% on the undisbursed
amounts, to be passed on to NIDC's sub-borrowers. The foreign exchange risk
would be borne by the Government through the Rastra Bank. Considering that
this is the first NIDC project, a low free limit of $80,000 has been set
(Section 2.03(b) of the Development Credit Agreement). This will allow IDA
prior approval of about 40% of subprojects by number and 75% by amount. In
order that NIDC lending covers a broad range of activities rather than just a
few large projects, the amount to be withdrawn from the proceeds of the credit
for any one sub-project shall not exceed $1.0 million equivalent (Section 2.03
(a)(ii) of the Development Credit Agreement).



- 14 -
Project Benefits and Risks
46.       The proposed credit is expected to have a significant impact on
the development of the industrial sector. The projects contained in NIDC's
current pipeline seem to be closely in line with the Government policies for
the sector and to correspond to the type of industrial development appropriate
to Nepal. The proposed project will contribute to mobilization of domestic
resources for investment, increased foreign exchange earnings/savings, and
generation of employment. (A sample of NIDC's projects in recent years has
shown a total investment cost per job of about $3,000). The proposed credit
is also designed to strengthen NIDC considerably as an institution - through
organizational changes, improved appraisal and follow-up practices, and
technical assistance - and thereby to enable NIDC to play a more effective
role in development.
47.       Possible risks associated with the proposed credit would be slower
than projected commitments and disbursements due to problems inherent in Nepal's
location, geography, and absorptive capacity. These risks appear to be small,
however, since NIDC's loan approvals, which dropped to a very low level in FY76
largely due to a sharp increase in interest rates (para 30), are expected to
increase in response to a subsequent partial decline in rates in July, 1976
(para 38).  This can be seen from the fact that the project pipeline upon which
projections for the proposed credit were based represents a substantial reduction
from NIDC's list of project applications at the time of appraisal. In addition,
significant improvements in management are expected to arise from the technical
assistance to be provided as a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
credit. It is possible, though, that the advisors may not be put to beneficial
use as has been the experience with some of the technical assistance given to
NIDC by bilateral donors in the past. Current NIDC management recognizes the
benefits that the institution would derive from the employment of these advisors,
which was not always so in the past, and leads us to expect that the program of
institution building, that forms part of the proposed credit, will reach its
goals.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
48.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Kingdom of Nepal
and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and
NIDC, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section
1(d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a draft resolution approv-
ing the proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors sepa-
rately.
49.       Execution of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement on behalf of the Borrower
and NIDC and employment of the two advisors for a period of two years each are
conditions of effectiveness (Section 5.01(b) and (c), respectively, of the
draft Development Credit Agreement). Special conditions of this credit are
listed in Section III of Annex IV.



- 15 -
50.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
51.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

C.   Projects in Execution 1/
Credit No. 223 - Highway Project US$2.5 million Credit of December 21,
1970; Effective Date: February 3, 1971; Closing Date:
June 30, 1975 - Revised Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Initially, project implementation was delayed mainly due to land
acquisition difficulties and a national shortage of cement and fuel. With
a delay of about eighteen months, the last of the five project road bridges
and the remaining two of the five porter suspension bridges were opened in
1976. All project road maintenance equipment has been received and is now
part of the Road Department fleet. Equipment workshop construction was
slowed due to contractual difficulties stemming from price escalation, but
the workshop construction is now almost completed. Although the total pro-
ject cost is approximately 11% above appraisal estimate, the economic rate
of return is not affected due to the effect of general inflation on the
benefits. The project is virtually complete, with remaining disbursements
to be made by the closing date.
Credit No. 291 - Tourism Project US$3.2 million Credit (Net of Cancellation)
of March 22, 1972; Effective Date: November 9, 1972;
Closing Date: September 30, 1975; Revised Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
Due to delays in appointing qualified architectural, engineer-
ing and project management consultants, and repeated changes in scope proposed
by the sponsors of the sub-projects, the proj4ect is two years behind schedule.
Construction of the Yak and Yeti sub-project is underway and is expected to be
completed by April, 1977. On the other hand, it was not possible to reach a
firm agreement with the sponsors on an appropriate revision of the Annapurna
sub-project, and $1.0 million of the Credit was cancelled from the original
allocation ($2.88 million) for that sub-project. The remaining $1.88 million
will meet increased costs of the Yak and Yeti sub-project and finance feasi-
bility studies for further tourism facilities outside the Kathmandu Valley.
Consultants have been engaged and the feasibility studies are under way.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the projects in execution and, in particular, to report any problems
which are being encountered and the action being taken. They should
be used in this sense with the understanding that they do not purport
to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project
execution.

Credit No. 373 - Birganj Irrigation Project US$6.0 million Credit of
April 18, 1973; Effective Date: July 9, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
Implementation of the project is progressing satisfactorily after
initial delays in appointing engineering consultants, in field surveys and in
procurement. About one third of the credit amount has been disbursed. Civil
works are being completed in one irrigation block and are in progress in two
further blocks and contracts have been awarded for civil works in another two
(out of the original total of twelve). Construction of tubewells is 70% com-
pleted in the groundwater areas. Due to a 50% cost overrun, a reduction in
the project area is being considered. The project remains viable as a result
of increases in agricultural product prices, and higher-than-expected intensity
of cultivation. The project should be completed by mid-1978.
Credit No. 397 - Telecommunications Project II US$5.5 million Credit of
June 20, 1973; Effective Date: September 11, 1973; Closing
Date: June 30, 1980
Due to organizational problems, lack of continuity in senior manage-
ment, and delay in obtaining expert assistance, there have been delays in the
procurement process and the project is about two years behind schedule. Good
progress is now being made with the assistance of experts and consultants pro-
vided by the United Kingdom and a new manager has been appointed. The project
is now expected to proceed satisfactorily and present estimates are for
completion by early 1980, six to twelve months behind schedule.
Credit No. 470 - Water Supply and Sewerage Project US$7.8 million Credit of
May 8, 1974; Effective Date: June 26, 1974; Closing Date:
June 30, 1978
Design work is complete and most of the-major contracts have now
been let. Project implementation is about one year behind schedule, because
of delays in letting the contracts. A management team of four experts pro-
vided by the United Kingdom has been assisting the Water Supply and Sewerage
Board. The total project cost is likely to exceed the appraised total by
US$6.0 million and the Government has requested IDA assistance in financing
this cost overrun. 1/
Credit No. 505 - Settlement Project US$6.0 million Credit of August 14, 1974;
Effective Date: February 20, 1975; Closing Date: July 15,
1982
Project implementation is two years behind the original schedule
but indications are that it is being accelerated. Twenty-three winch lorries
have been procured and operators are being trained in their use. Work has

to the Executive Directors on a no-objection basis.

also begun on clearing the timber from projected settlement areas. However,
the project is not yet free of problems, particularly in management and plan-
ning by concerned agencies, and intensive supervision of the project is con-
tinuing. In addition, changes in the Government's land use policy have led to
requests, which are now under consideration, to restructure the project by
reducing its size about 40%.
Credit No. 600 - Kulekhani Hydroelectric Project US$26.0 million Credit of
January 9, 1976; Effective Date: May 18, 1976; Closing
Date: December 31, 1981
Bids for the major civil works have been received and are being
evaluated. Bid documents for plant and equipment are expected to be issued
around the end of April and contracts to be awarded around the end of
August 1977. Preliminary estimates indicate that cost overruns of 60% may
materialize and sources of supplementary funds are being explored. A super-
vision mission visited Nepal in March, 1977, to assist the Government in re-
viewing the civil works bid evaluation report.
Credit No. 617 - Rural Development Project US$8.0 million Credit of
April 30, 1976; Effective Date: July 16, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
Progress to date has been most satisfactory, with almost all planned
pgroject actions being implemented ahead of schedule. Inter-ministerial coopera-
tion is good and at the district level, sound and practical development plans
have been produced which are fully supported and understood by project farmers.
Adequate financing to carry out project proposals has been made available in
the budget by the Government; sites and plans for most district construction
projects have been completed, and construction is expected to begin in April;
the seed exchange program has begun a year early; and five water.supply
schemes are expected to be completed by end-July. Shortage of middle-level
staff in the project area for construction supervision and agricultural
extension may hinder project implementation in the coming year. However,
arrangements have been made for more efficient deployment of existing staff
and for special training of agricultural assistants resident in the project
area to meet project needs. Under the associated Bank executed UNDP technical
assistance project, the assistant to the Project Coordinator, the Irrigation
Advisor, and the advisor to the Project Evaluation Unit have been appointed.

firm has been appointed and have recently started their work, and arrangements
for procurement have been instituted. Drilling of tubewells is expected to
start in May, 1977.
