                         The objective of the restructured project is to develop and apply management and learning tools for use by government andcommunities to improve efficiency
                         and accountability of the Cameroon education sector.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Recent improvements in project implementation and increased involvement from all stakeholders have yielded some results. The most notable achievements over the period of the
                         ISR include (i) an evaluation of the implementation of each education sub-sector strategy for 2008-2011; (ii) the provision to the Ministries of Primary and Secondary Education of IT
                         equipment to support the rationalization of Human Resources Management; and (iii) various capacity building activities, including on planning and school mapping, and designing
                         school health policies.

                         Although these achievements are encouraging, seen in a broader context, the PASE runs a significant risk of falling short of meeting its Development Objectives. Indeed, while the
                         PASE is expected to significantly contribute to the ongoing update of the Education Sector Strategy through the provision of sound analytical underpinnings, delays in procuring key
                         inputs will probably prevent part of the analytical results to be factored into the final document. In addition, in view of the project closure in one year, the classrooms renovation

                         intended results.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project was advised to accelerate implementation pace through (i) further progress on addressing procurement bottlenecks, (ii) hiring of a experienced and recognized adviser to
                         coordinate the analytical agenda, provide quality assurance and liaise with the Committee in charge of the update of the Sector Strategy, (iii) strategically reallocate the funds freed
                         up by the canceling/downsizing of training activities, in coordination with all stakeholders; and (iv) further improve monitoring and evaluation processes to closely watch and address
                         potential delays, and record achievements in view of the project closure in 2012.
