                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Improvements in project implementation and increased involvement from all stakeholders have yielded some results. The most notable achievements over the period of the ISR
                         include (i) the completion of the capacity development for the preparation of the sector simulation model. The next step is the preparation of the diagnostics for the sector. The work in
                         this area has commenced; (iii) good progress in procurement particularly: (a) with the signing of the contract for the schools renovation program; and (b) the preparation of the
                         technical and financial specifications for the construction of latrines and well. For the schools renovation program the community sensitization process will commence in April 2012;

                         and (iv) towards the preparation of the contract for acquiring Global Distance Learning Network (GDLN) equipment.

                         Despite the encouraging progress in project implementation, with just five months to closing, the Project is unlikely to meet its Development Objectives. The Project is expected to
                         significantly contribute to the Ministries of Education efforts to update of the Education Sector Strategy through the provision of sound analytical underpinnings. However, the delays

                         in procuring key inputs will prevent the completion of the diagnostics for the sector prior to project closing in August 2012.

                         It is important to note that the project development objectives maybe reached after the closing date of the project since the foundation work would have already been completed prior
                         to project closing. The ministries of education have received significant capacity development to undertake analytical work and to improve efficiency with accountability. The results
                         could be measurable by the successful completion of the diagnostics for the education sector, the preparation of the education sector plan for the period 2013-2015, and the
                         implementation strategy for the period 2013-2016.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         As advised, the project team has accelerated the implementation pace by specifically addressing procurement bottlenecks. There has been some progress: (i) with the hiring a
                         specialist to lead the preparation of the education sector country status report (RESEN); (ii) through strategically reallocating the funds by canceling/downsizing some project
                         activities, in coordination with all stakeholders; and (iii) by further improving monitoring and evaluation processes to closely watch and address potential delays, and record
                         achievements in view of the project closure in 2012.
