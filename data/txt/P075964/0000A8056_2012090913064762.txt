                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Education Development Capacity Building Project will close on September 1, 2012. The team responsible for projectimplementation support over the past six months estimates
                         that it is likely that the project development objective will be largelyachieved only after project closing but not before, despite progress having been made in project implementation
                         over the past fewmonths. The original project was restructured in April 2010 in order to improve the possibility for achieving the developmentobjective. However, implementation
                         progress continued to be sluggish until the final months prior to project closing. Afull-fledged efficiency analysis could not be carried out prior to project closing due to the intensive

                         rehabilitation of 419 classrooms, theconstruction of at least between 70 and 90 latrines, and the digging of 33 out of the 37 are envisaged to be completed byend-project

                         importance will be the capacity building activities in support ofthe education sector strategy preparation. The activities to develop and update the strategic vision for the education
                         sector(Component 1) are progressing and their contribution to the PDO would be visible only after project closing. The activities forstrengthening the education information system
                         and planning capacity have had to be scaled down significantly since the transactioncosts to coordination between multiple education ministries has yielded little results with no
                         agreement on setting up a unifiededucation sector information system. Activities relating to the reinforcement of sector monitoring (Component 3) have progressedreasonably well
                         and will contribute positively to the achievement of the PDO. Finally, the activities to improve publicparticipation (Component 4) have moved forward, but the lag time has been
                         significant and the full outcome of the activities canonly be measured after project closing.

                         Analysis following the final supervision mission has revealed that: (i) the project hasbeen under implementation for a combined (pre- and post restructuring periods) of seven years
                         from 2005/06 to 2011/12. During thisperiod the project was restructured. There had been no major political, social, or economic incidences during the period to retardproject
                         implementation, and warrant project disbursement suspension. But despite progressive efforts to ameliorate implementation,cumulative disbursements reached only 36% for the pre-
                         restructured project, and only increased to 53% at the end of thepost-restructured implementation period. There have been significant delays on the part of the Project Secretariat to
                         reallocatefunds between eligible expenditure categories, and to cancel a portion of the funds that will not be utilized by the project. Thishas resulted in delays in recording up to date
                         expenditures for the project. However, the issues are being addressed. With thecancellation of approximately 14.6% of the project funds, the remaining 32.4% is expected to be
                         disbursed during the four monthsgrace period following project closure, bringing the total disbursements for the project to 84.6% of the original projectfinancing. The remaining
                         disbursements will be for eligible expenditures, high priority activities, and services/goods/ works withvalue for money. Appropriate fiduciary controls are in place to mitigate risks, and
                         the Government is taking measures to sustainthe project funded assets, particularly for the GDLN and the infrastructure aspects.
